<p><em>&gt; Damien, have you ever heard the saying, &quot;If you torture the data enough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will confess?&quot;  This looks to me remarkably like the analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegedly significant events in the so-called &quot;Bible Code&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps part of this is due to their interpretation involving a 'global
<br>
consciousness'. I haven't looked at their data enough to even begin to
<br>
form any coherent ideas, but I found it interesting that the subsequent
<br>
'period of silence' seemed to decrease the randomness of the EGG data
<br>
(if I am interpreting that correctly).
<br>
<p>One alternative to the 'global consciousness' idea might be that we are
<br>
living in a computer simulation, or maybe cellular automaton, and more
<br>
so, a hash CA in which lookup tables are used to skip intermediate steps
<br>
between slices of 'reality' (or whatever). The 911 events stirred up the
<br>
pot so to speak, reducing the efficiency of the lookups and requiring
<br>
more generation by generation computing, while the 'period of silence'
<br>
enabled more efficiency in the lookups since a significant number of
<br>
people weren't doing anything. I realize this is not how CA's work and I
<br>
am totally lacking in the math skills to either explain what I mean or
<br>
interpret the data. Nonetheless even this sketchy hand-waving
<br>
incorporates the 'period of silence' EGG effects better than their
<br>
global consciousness theory.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we could test this theory by placing large nuclear bombs
<br>
throughout the world and set them to be set off on some random trigger.
<br>
They would need to be in cities where they would be 'noticed' by
<br>
sentient beings. We might also use such opportunities to have teams of
<br>
observers stand by who would be instructed to *not* be distracted by the
<br>
subsequent tragic events, instead they would concentrate on other areas
<br>
of reality and see if any anomalies occur as computational resources are
<br>
diverted to simulate the multitude of disruptions when one of these
<br>
bombs go off. Sounds a bit drastic though.
<br>
<p>This might also explain the Fermi paradox: if we are not alone in this
<br>
universe I might expect to see similar EGG activity from time to time as
<br>
world-changing events take place on other planets. Then again I haven't
<br>
yet looked at their location-by-location results.
