<em>&gt;&gt; Without fire safety regs, large dense cities frequently had a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; devastating fire every few years or decades. One fire would cause untold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deaths and the loss of thousands of homes and businesses. Today, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; individual fire that occurs is generally contained within its building
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or within a small part of a building due to the required use of fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; retardant matnerials, and deaths would be minor due to required
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; installation of fire safety equipment (like extinguishers, fire escapes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; smoke alarms, and public education).

<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<p><p>When towns were built mainly of wood large fires were common (ie up to the
<br>
17th century). They became much less frequent as other materials were more
<br>
widely used. However this didn't require government fire regulation codes,
<br>
the same effect was achieved by insurers and by the use of restrictive
<br>
covenants in building leases which stipulated that materials such as brick
<br>
or stone be used in any construction. (The insurers also had their own fire
<br>
engine sevices, interestingly). So this was achieved by voluntary agreement,
<br>
as you say. Steve Davies
