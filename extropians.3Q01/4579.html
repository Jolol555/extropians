<br>
<p><em>&gt;The reason I didn't go back to the greeks in that message is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm looking more directly at the modern self in the context of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies, and furthermore related to both sexes. Although I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not up on my greek and roman history, I believe much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fascination in the body was male orientated, though there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious exceptions.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that &quot;fascination&quot; is the right word to use in the
<br>
context of the Greek's philosophy of their bodies. I also don't agree
<br>
with the view that the body image of the ancient Greeks was mostly
<br>
male-oriented.
<br>
<p>For the first, I think that &quot;reverence&quot; might be a more suitable
<br>
word than &quot;fascination&quot;. The Greek's view of their bodies was
<br>
strongly coupled with their view of their natural world, in that
<br>
they saw beauty and harmony and felt it was their duty to preserve
<br>
it, and their place in it.
<br>
<p>For the Greeks, the human body was a masterpiece. They would make
<br>
sure to do everything humanly possible to promote its health and
<br>
therefore, its beauty. They would go to the gym (heh.. gymno in
<br>
Greek means naked..), exercising every day, bathing every day in
<br>
private or public baths, cover their skin with olive oil and herbs
<br>
to moisturize and scent it. You can follow some of their body-care
<br>
in the old stories. For example, in Homer's Odyssey, every time
<br>
Odysseus passed through, yet, another calamity and was in a place
<br>
where he could recover, the first thing that he would do before
<br>
feasting his face was to bathe and anoint himself with olive oil.
<br>
<p>The mind-body link to the Greeks was very strong. Health was
<br>
important if you wanted to be beautiful: in mind and in flesh. In
<br>
fact, the mind was considered to be a bit more important because the
<br>
beauty of mind was identified with virtues like justice and honesty,
<br>
for example.
<br>
<p>The Greeks took the mind-body link one step further to the arena of
<br>
&quot;action&quot;. The aesthetic of the body and the health that accrues from
<br>
physical fitness was a symbol and evidence for the reality that
<br>
every individual has the power to translate word into deed and to be
<br>
men and women of action, and not of just talk.
<br>
<p>[Did you know that the early Greeks preferred their athletics nude?
<br>
They invented the Olympic Games on this basis. ]
<br>
<p>About your perception that the Greeks interest in the body was
<br>
male-oriented: it's sadly true that Greek women could not vote or
<br>
hold office, however Greek men insisted on incorporating strong
<br>
female characters into every aspect of their art and literature.
<br>
<p>The women are present in the Greek art: which is logical since the
<br>
Spartans, Argive, Eleusinians, and Athenians felt that Artemis,
<br>
Hera, Demeter, and Athena alone, respectively, were their patron
<br>
deities. Upon skimming through the &quot;Greek Art&quot; chapter of my college
<br>
art history book, I saw equal numbers of Kore (maiden) and Kouros
<br>
(young boy) statues (interestingly though, she is always clothed)
<br>
from about 600 B.C., other famous statues like &quot;Hera&quot; from Samos,
<br>
and the flying female Gorgon on the Temple of Artemis at Corfu. Then
<br>
about one or two hundred years later, the Greeks sculpted the female
<br>
form magnificently: the Dying Niobid (this one alone is a
<br>
masterpiece in uniting motion and emotion!), the Three Goddesses
<br>
from the pediment of the Parthenon, and Nike from the balustrade of
<br>
the Temple of Athena Nike.
<br>
<p>There are some very strong women in the Greek literature, but I
<br>
don't know yet if they act with the same kind of body-care as the
<br>
male characters. Consider this story premise, however:
<br>
<p>In Aristophanes' Lysistrata, a comedic play he wrote during the
<br>
Peloponnesian War (431-403 B.C.), he wanted to show the insanity of
<br>
war. In this play, the women of Greece barricade themselves on the
<br>
Acropolis and go on a sex strike, in order to convince their
<br>
husbands to try end the war.  The play premise mixes fantasy and
<br>
reality, to show that the women's efforts are just as silly as the
<br>
men's war efforts (or is it really that silly to give up an
<br>
undending war, in exchange for a resumption of sex?).
<br>
<p>I can only imagine (!) how a Greek from two thousand years ago would
<br>
feel about their transhumanist bodies today. In their daily life
<br>
from long ago, their actions seemed to show that they felt that the
<br>
human form was a &quot;gift&quot; and perfect as it was, and therefore, it was
<br>
their moral duty to take care about it. However, their bodies were
<br>
strongly linked to their philosophy and their natural environment,
<br>
so one can speculate, too, that if their philosophy encouraged
<br>
modifying one's environment to suit oneself, then the body
<br>
modifications should naturally follow.
<br>
<p>One interesting fact-finding effort you can do now, in order to try
<br>
to learn how different cultures in different countries feel about
<br>
body-modification, is to see how &quot;accepting&quot; is the culture of the
<br>
human body, in general. How? Take a look at the number of existing
<br>
naturist resorts (or, at the very least, see how common or uncommon
<br>
you would find topless women). There are worlwide networks of
<br>
naturist resorts and naturist societies (a search on the Web will do
<br>
it), as well as published books for where these places are located.
<br>
I would say that one mark of a civilized country is the number of
<br>
its nude and topless beaches/resorts.
