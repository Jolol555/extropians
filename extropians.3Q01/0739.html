You might be right but I wonder about your implicit ceteris paribus clause
<br>
here. If the Flynn effect is real then the greater intelligence of the youth
<br>
may allow them to gobble-up more from the epistemic trough. Presumably, one
<br>
has to worry about quality as opposed to quantity issues here as well. Given
<br>
the speed in which the world is changing, certain types of knowledge may no
<br>
longer be particularly valuable. Grandpa might no better how to replace a
<br>
vacuum tube in a radio, or get over the Berlin wall, etc. but the value of
<br>
this knowledge is not what it used to be. Even fleecing has become more
<br>
sophisticated: knowing how to get an Encyclopaedia salesmen's foot out of
<br>
the door might not help the elderly in avoiding telemarketers. However, I
<br>
suppose I should defer to your greater wisdom here--you are, after all,
<br>
older than me. :)
<br>
Mark.
