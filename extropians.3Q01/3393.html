<p>
<em>&gt; My take on the Sapir-Worf hypothesis is that it is a one-way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which people try to apply both ways.  If you know the word 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for something,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you know that concept. If you don't know a word for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have difficulty with a concept.  People go too far and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't understand the concept without the word.
</em><br>
<p>I dont see how your mind could represent a concept without tagging some form
<br>
of identification onto it. That which cannot be referenced, cant be recalled
<br>
for use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Words also shape the way you think.  A lot of people don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and names, and therefore accept inaccurate or imprecise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words.  Here's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good example:  What color is the sky?  Almost every one says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;blue&quot; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is the word that is always associated with the sky.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you that it is &quot;blue-green&quot;.  Before you argue, go to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paint program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and look at the color that computers call &quot;cyan&quot;.  &quot;Cyan&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the sky, but if you look up it's definition, it is equal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and green.  The sky is half way between green and blue, yet by English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition, we always call it &quot;blue&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I thougt of a pretty neat explanation to this old &quot;are you seeing the same
<br>
color as I am&quot; question. I think everyone would agree theres a certain
<br>
transition of the colors through the spectrum. Light colors to dark colors I
<br>
would call it. Your reds, yellows, orange on one side all possess this fuzzy
<br>
attribute of lightness. Blue, green, etc... over on the other side seem
<br>
darker. So, if we were all seeing different colors, there wouldnt be a
<br>
smooth transition from light to dark, but a random stratification of colors.
<br>
Something like a blue sandwiched between a red and yellow would look rather
<br>
out of place in a rainbow. What do you think, make any sense?
