</em><br>
<p>Can we pass on contact lens thang, please? I didn't bring it up initially
<br>
and the metaphor is wearing thin.  I don't want folks to get confused by
<br>
the continued reference.  I have never equated a person wearing a contact
<br>
lens as a transhuman.  
<br>
<p>You mention &quot;Primo 3M+&quot;.  I think that you have the impression that Primo
<br>
is only about the physical body, as in a future body design.  Perhaps you
<br>
missed the pages of images and writing that explain Primo's &quot;meta brain&quot;
<br>
which is used as to enhance intellect, the integration between the brain
<br>
and memory, ability to solve complex problems, etc..  Inasmuch, Primo
<br>
covers the mind as well as the physical body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But to me, &quot;transhuman&quot; has almost purely the connotation of a transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind.  (snip)
</em><br>
<p>Transhuman would more fully reflect both the physical and the mental.  The
<br>
brain is part of the body.  The senses interact with the brain by sending
<br>
messages.  By enhancing the senses, we are enhancing the brain.  The
<br>
cognition (reasoning) you are thinking about seems to be a purely
<br>
intellectual process, which is certainly important in defining humans, but
<br>
we are not just intellectual beings.  However, if we had a genetic
<br>
treatment that allowed us to be physically ageless but we were no smarter
<br>
or more intellectual than before, we would undeniably be transhuman because
<br>
agelessness is outside the limits of our genes, regardless of an average
<br>
IQ.  Further, part of intelligence is social intelligence in dealing with
<br>
people effectively. Example:  If we could enhance the ability of  person A
<br>
to see person B's blood flow and then to watch it heating up through an
<br>
augmented visual extro-vision which  would give a person A more advantage -
<br>
new sensory ability, this sensory ability would  be considered beyond
<br>
human. It is not a cognitive thing, but a sensory thing. 
<br>
<p>What about a person who has a genetic malfunction and is given a synthetic
<br>
enzyme.  Would this person be at early transhuman stage?  What about a
<br>
person who is born a man and has not only a sex change but also hormone
<br>
therapy?  The issue would probably be the alteration of what it is to be
<br>
human or, on an individual basis, what it is to be that person (with his or
<br>
her genetic makeup) which has been altered.
<br>
<p>In order to deter the &quot;black and white&quot; element of someone claiming &quot;I am a
<br>
transhuman&quot;, perhaps it would better to use the phrase &quot;I have transhuman
<br>
element&quot; or &quot;There are aspects of me that are transhuman.&quot;
<br>
<p>Transhuman is definitely a term that can be misconstrued.  There may be
<br>
some who agree with me in that today we are at an *early* transhuman stage,
<br>
and others who do not.  Some may even disregard the term altogether and use
<br>
transhumanist because they  place more emphasis on the values of a
<br>
transhuman than the mental/physical evolutionary transition.
