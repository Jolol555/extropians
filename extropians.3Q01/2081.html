</em><br>
<p>I think with mature nano/biotech we will come closer then ever before.  Of course, there will be those who outstrip others, as is the case now.  But, I think what your &quot;personal attributes&quot; and &quot;social rating&quot; is will be more determined by your own actions rather then being a member of the L.S.C.(Lucky Sperm Club).  I say that because intelligence and physical appearance will be much more malleable then today.  At least for those from wealthy nations who have the money... lol

<p>I guess I would have to agree! 
<br>
<p>I see myself in the late 21st century having just gotten reanimated from cryonic suspension, and dating a gal from that time who is as beautiful as any present-day exotic supermodel.  She will tell me how homely she feels compared to the women who can afford the latest bodymods.  But, I'll still be pretty damn happy!  : )
