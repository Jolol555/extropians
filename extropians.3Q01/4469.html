<br>
economies can often be attributed to mismanagement of faulty data, then with 
<br>
the advent of advances such as artificial intelligence, comprehensive 
<br>
economic data on both macro- and micro- levels, as well as more refined 
<br>
modeling and forecasting techniques, there is no reason why centrally 
<br>
controlled economies may not turn out to be the more effective system,  after 
<br>
all, in the future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Stephen Ambrose and Frederick Von Hayek.  Hayek tells us that 
<br>
dictators get into power because things get far enough out of hand that the 
<br>
people call for a man on horseback to make all the decisions and set things 
<br>
right.  That one man makes all important decisions and his decisions must 
<br>
carried out under threat of severe punishment.  If his will is thwarted then 
<br>
matters cannot be corrected and the people must continue to suffer.  He is 
<br>
not above the law -- he is the law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for Ambrose.  He tells us that between D-day and VE day -- a 
<br>
period of eleven months -- over 50,000 German soldiers were executed on the 
<br>
western front alone.  The reason given was failure or cowardice in the face 
<br>
of the enemy.  But if we read we find that Hitler gave specific orders for 
<br>
particular troop movements.  Naturally sometimes he made errors.  It doesn't 
<br>
matter how often he made them in the beginning he would have had to make 
<br>
some.  If those errors led to a defeat as a soldier in those units you would 
<br>
risk death, if you survived the defeat you risked being shot for not carrying 
<br>
out orders accurately because defeat could not possibly be the fault of the 
<br>
man on horseback.  Naturally, some began feeding the man on horseback 
<br>
erroneous information.  That led to more errors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Soviet Union fell it is said our CIA was caught completely by 
<br>
surprise.  Why?  Because they had infiltrated the KGB and were certain they 
<br>
were getting the same data the KGB received.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of us are old enough remember the crackdowns in the Soviet 
<br>
for economic crimes and the heads that rolled for failure to make the various 
<br>
five year plans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis showed the collapse of the Soviet caught even the KGB, and 
<br>
our CIA, by surprise because no one could afford to be blamed for failure and 
<br>
consequently they fed the KGB faulty data even as German Generals fed Hitler 
<br>
faulty data.  No one could afford to be the scape goat.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can improve data gathering but way out the on the end of the 
<br>
pointed stick is a human being that inputs the data.  If that human being is 
<br>
going to be punished for delivering the message then the message is going to 
<br>
get &quot;cooked&quot; to be something that doesn't result in his or her execution.
