If you're worried about computers taking over the world, you can relax - for
<br>
now.
<br>
<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134327121_gates08.htm">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134327121_gates08.htm</a>

<br>
It will be at least a generation before computers can fool people into
<br>
thinking the machines are human, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates predicted
<br>
yesterday in his keynote speech at a conference of artificial-intelligence
<br>
researchers in Seattle.
<br>
<p>But Gates is optimistic about the possibilities of intelligent machines,
<br>
something that captured his imagination as a youth and is now a top priority
<br>
in Microsoft's $5.3 billion research organization.
<br>
<p>Computers are already fast enough to see, hear, listen and learn, which is
<br>
making them easier to operate and more useful tools, he said.
<br>
<p>Building a humanlike computer has taken longer than Gates and other
<br>
enthusiasts imagined in the 1960s and 1970s, however. Computers are getting
<br>
powerful enough, but writing the software to run a truly intelligent machine
<br>
has proved to be tricky.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're very tough problems, so 25 years later the dreams are very much the
<br>
same,&quot; Gates said.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is pursuing artificial-intelligence research that
<br>
improves computers' speech recognition, vision, language skills, and abilities
<br>
to retrieve and search for information. It's also working on software to
<br>
enable machines to learn and continuously improve so, for instance, errors
<br>
won't be repeated.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're talking about software products that many hundreds of millions, if not
<br>
billions, of people will be using and taking advantage of every day,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Gates refrained from making bold predictions about robots and other machines
<br>
from science fiction, prototypes of which are on display and playing in a
<br>
soccer tournament elsewhere in the Washington State Convention and Trade
<br>
Center this week.
<br>
<p>A highlight of the conference is the RoboCup competition, in which researchers
<br>
field teams of robots in soccer games.
<br>
<p>Hundreds of middle- and high-school students also were competing with robots
<br>
that manipulated pingpong balls.
<br>
<p>Also on display are robots ranging from Sony's mechanical dog, which can
<br>
figure out how to stand back up when it falls down, to vacuum-cleaner-size
<br>
industrial machines that rolled around the exhibition hall like dumb versions
<br>
of Star Wars' R2D2.
<br>
<p>Attendees also can see a Boeing-NASA research project on intelligent
<br>
flight-control systems, which automatically figure out the best way to fly an
<br>
airplane after a component failure.
<br>
<p>On a smaller scale, graduate students from Northwestern University are
<br>
demonstrating a robot the size of a toilet-paper tube that can move around,
<br>
jump over obstacles and transmit video images. Called Scouts, the robots are
<br>
being developed with military funding for &quot;urban-policing&quot; duties such as
<br>
surveillance.
<br>
<p>Eventually Scouts would be fired like grenades into buildings, then find dark
<br>
corners from which they would monitor motion.
<br>
<p>Although she's developing a tiny robot for the government to spy on people,
<br>
Northwestern graduate student Kristen Stubbs said she's more concerned about
<br>
how much Gates and Microsoft will limit users' control of their computers with
<br>
new software such as the Windows XP operating system.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's kind of a fine line between how smart you want your computers to be,
<br>
and how much control you have,&quot; she said. &quot;I worry about that.&quot;
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
