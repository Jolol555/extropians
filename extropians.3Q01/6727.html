But the main reason the US must support Israel at all costs is that Israel
<br>
is its only reliable ally in a region that contains something like 2/3 of
<br>
the world's proven oil reserves. Even if the US  were not now totally
<br>
dependent on imported oil to maintain its economy, its economy is largely
<br>
dependent on foreign trade, which depends on oil obtained from a limited
<br>
number of locations worldwide.
<br>
<p>Oil is crucial in almost every industry from agriculture up. Without a
<br>
steady supply of oil at relatively low prices, there would be a transition
<br>
stage (to a new sort of economy) of a scope that is difficult to imagine.
<br>

Negative ma'am.  The United States can do just fine by opening up
<br>
Alaska and contenting itself with the petroleum rescources here in
<br>
the Western Hemisphere.  In truth that's likely one reason why
<br>
liberals want to conserve Alaska (regardless of what rights and 
<br>
wishs of Alaskan state citizens) and lock up the state in a straitjacket
<br>
of Wetlands Laws and various pseudo-Green nonsense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An America that utilized it's own rescources and those of it's
<br>
natural (geographically adjacent) allies would not NEED to
<br>
be playing realpolitik on the behalf of Tel Aviv (and would not
<br>
need the &quot;Excuse&quot; of middle east oil).  I suspect Europe
<br>
might have to pay it's own way a bit more then.....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's weird is fossil fuel economies are on their last surge
<br>
before they are abandoned...why are we &quot;saving&quot; supplies in
<br>
the Western Hemisphere at the cost of American lives?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
cheers,
<br>
