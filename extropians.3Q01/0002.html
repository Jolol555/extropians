</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I'm not going to let you get away with the statement.
</em><br>
<p>I have not investigated what sort of scientists are on the 1800 person
<br>
petition that claims global warming is a problem, or the 17,000 person
<br>
petition that claims it is not, this is true. The four scientists on
<br>
Stossel's program the other night are on the 17k petition and are, in
<br>
fact, involved in the research, and they have nothing but ridicule for
<br>
the idea that anthropomorphic CO2 is a significant threat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I discuss in my paper, the current atmosphereic CO2 levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are 368 ppmv.  The highest preveiously documented levels were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 275 ppmv reached during the inter-glacial eras as documented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the Vostok ice cores.  We are *way* over the CO2 level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen by the Earth in recent history.  The fact that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continually increasing demonstrates clearly that existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems to absorb it cannot keep up with human activities.
</em><br>
<p>Yet despite having a much higher CO2 level, we are not much warmer than
<br>
the past thousand years, while most of the last 10,000 years has
<br>
actually been far warmer than the current day. In 5,000 BC temps were
<br>
5-10 degrees warmer than the current day, with CO2 levels nearly half
<br>
the current level, with no collapse of ice caps, no worldwide floods,
<br>
yadda yadda yadda. CO2's behavior as a greenhouse gas is not linear, it
<br>
follows a curve of diminishing returns, and we've been on the plateau
<br>
for quite a while, according to my cousin Andrew, who is an ice age
<br>
geology doctoral candidate (he just finished his masters). Adding more
<br>
to the stew contributes less and less to warming at our planet's
<br>
atmospheric pressure. It is physically impossible for us to wind up in a
<br>
Venus-like runaway greenhouse situation simply because Venus never
<br>
sequestered its proto-atmosphere in limestone like Earth did (Venus has
<br>
the equivalent of ~92 earth atmospheres, and since life never evolved
<br>
there to any degree that we know of, it never sequestered most of it.
<br>
Earth started off with about 53 atmospheres worth of gas, 52 of which it
<br>
sequestered mostly in limestone, mostly prior to and during the Cambrian
<br>
period, while the remainder coalesced as our oceans, and we are left
<br>
with the surplus of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace amounts of CO2, CO,
<br>
and other compounds.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the only reason we haven't seen massive global warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (IMO) is because the planet has a huge amount of thermal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inertia (mostly in the oceans I'd guess) and so global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming accelerates very slowly.
</em><br>
<p>Not really. Since the polar oceans are supposed to be warming faster
<br>
than the equator, this means that thermal conductance is moving along
<br>
pretty rapidly. While the US is 0.5 degrees warmer, Siberia is 2 degrees
<br>
warmer, and the equator is barely warmer at all. If the 'thermal
<br>
inertia' is as you say, especially with the oceans, this should not be
<br>
happening. Instead the equator should be warming faster than the poles.
<br>
<p>The long term trend for the earth is not a greenhouse, it is toward an
<br>
ice house. CO2 freed by burning of fossil fuels will, within the next
<br>
century, be locked up mostly in carbonate coral formations that will
<br>
eventually become limestone. After that, we will burn up the methane
<br>
hydrates frozen in the ocean floors, and the CO2 from that will also
<br>
then become locked up mostly in coral, till eventually the new ice age
<br>
begins from lack of CO2, sea levels will fall dramatically as the ice
<br>
grows. The lowering of sea levels will cause a drop in pressure at the
<br>
sea floors which will cause catastrophic releases of methane hydrates
<br>
into the atmosphere, causing a new warming period, until they are locked
<br>
up more permanently in coral. This process will cycle again and again
<br>
until the earth freezes over permanently, with all carbon locked up
<br>
permenently in limestone, long before the sun warms enough from its main
<br>
sequence evolution. Venus is not the future of Earth, Mars is.
