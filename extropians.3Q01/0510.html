<em>&gt;From water whirlpools to meteorological tornadoes to superfluid
</em><br>
Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC), vortices abound in nature.
<br>
<p>But it is difficult, if not impossible, to reverse the direction
<br>
of rotation in a vortex without first destroying it.
<br>
<p>Gabriel Molina-Terriza, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain) has
<br>
observed in detail for the first time a reversal in the spin of an
<br>
optical vortex, a specially prepared light beam with a central dark core.
<br>
<p>Studying the reversal of spin in this relatively simple type of vortex may
<br>
provide powerful insights into other vortices and whether they too can
<br>
reverse direction. 
<br>
<p>Around the dark eye of an optical tornado, the energy carried by the light
<br>
beam flows like a spiral staircase, in a clockwise or counterclockwise
<br>
direction. Researchers in the last decade have built devices to reverse the
<br>
spin of an optical vortex, but they have not observed what happens during
<br>
the reversal.  
<br>
<p>Now, the researchers employ a trick both to reverse and observe the optical
<br>
vortex. They pass it through a cylindrical lens.  As the vortex travels
<br>
beyond the lens, its once-spherical core elongates like putty until it
<br>
is a vanishingly thin line.  As the vortex moves farther beyond the
<br>
lens, the core eventually compresses itself into an ellipse but the
<br>
energy around it spins in an opposite direction.
<br>
<p>These optical maelstroms can potentially carry several channels of quantum
<br>
data for such applications as quantum entanglement and teleportation, and
<br>
they can serve as optical tweezers for holding and rotating microscopic
<br>
objects.   
<br>
<p>They can also shed light on vortex behavior in Bose-Einstein
<br>
Condensates, since both optical and BEC vortices are described by
<br>
similar equations.  The researchers' observations with light suggest
<br>
that BECs with weakly interacting atoms may have vortices whose
<br>
spins constantly reverse direction.
