Hmm. He *must* be given Greg Egan's _Teranesia_, which has an Indian
<br>
protagonist, but maybe not for a year a two. No matter how bright he is,
<br>
there's a good chance that he's not yet ready at age 10 for adult sf of the
<br>
complexity of Egan's. I wouldn't want to take the risk and turn him off it.
<br>
But I bet he'll love Egan's more accessible work by age 12. He should also
<br>
start getting into solid adult hard sf by Benford etc and the current
<br>
British crop such as Ken MacLeod by then.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Damien's juveniles would be a good place to start but I don't
<br>
know whether any of them are available over there ... I suspect not. My
<br>
buddy Alison Goodman has her _Singing the Dogstar Blues_ coming out in the
<br>
US some time soon. This is aimed at teenagers, but he might be ready to
<br>
tackle it, certainly by the time it is available. It's light and funny, as
<br>
well as clever.
<br>
<p>I reckon he should also leaven it with a bit of fantasy. It never did me any
<br>
harm, at least not in the long run &lt;g&gt;.

<p>Greg Burch said
<br>
<p><p>A family of relatively recent Indian immigrants who are merchants in our
<br>
neighbrohood have a 10-year-old son who seems to be shaping up to be a math
<br>
and science prodigy.  &lt;snip&gt; When I proposed that we might try to
<br>
interest him in some science fiction, his father's eyes lit up and he
<br>
responded that it was a &quot;splendid&quot; idea.
