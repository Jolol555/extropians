<p>I'll pass on these questions &amp; more to Jeff &amp; get the official company
<br>
line.  (I try to avoid speaking for the corporation since that's Jeff's
<br>
job, and I don't want to muddy the waters.)  Alas, the back seat of the
<br>
EZrocket is occupied by the LOX tanks, although a future mod with
<br>
pump-fed propellants might be able to reclaim the back seat.  I would
<br>
get one of the first rides, of course- one of the perks of the job.
<br>
<p>That said, Oshkosh was a lot of fun, I met Chuck Kuecker and one other
<br>
extropian, SJ Van Sickle I think.  Forgive me if my memory for names was
<br>
a bit saturated.  It's a shame we didn't get Chuck Yeager and Scott
<br>
Crossfield to come by, though.  One of the hardest things was convincing
<br>
people that it is indeed a rocket, not a pulsejet or turbojet; the small
<br>
size of the engine itself was also surprising to many.  Photos of rocket
<br>
engines running show the shock diamonds in the exhaust, and a lot of
<br>
people didn't understand that they are a stable pattern until we did
<br>
some demo runs with the 15 lbf engine.  
<br>
<p>Pilots would give a knowing laugh when I said, &quot;With 800 pounds of
<br>
thrust in a 1700 pound gross aircraft, it accelerates to Vne [for
<br>
nonpilots that's never exceed speed], then pulls up to stop
<br>
accelerating.  After 2 minutes, it's over 12,000 feet, still at Vne, and
<br>
a climb angle of 40 degrees.&quot;  Since GA pilots are generally very power
<br>
limited, they tend to drool over fighter aircraft-like performance. 
<br>
It'll be a hit on the airshow circuit.

<br>
<p>The press articles are a bit garbled about the number of engines and the
<br>
duration; for the record, it's designed for two 400 lbf engines, carries
<br>
about 470 lb of LOX &amp; 99% Isopropanol, and should get about 2:20
<br>
duration at full throttle, 4:40 at 50%.  For the first flight and while
<br>
on display at Oshkosh, it had only one engine mounted- we plan to do a
<br>
design update, fabricate new engines, and install them for more flight
<br>
tests in about three weeks.
<br>
<p>We'll have more pics up on our site Real Soon Now (after we catch up on
<br>
other things).  The human eye is far more versatile than even a digital
<br>
camera; the shock diamonds were clearly visible and the plume was not as
<br>
wide is it appears (overexposed) in the images.
