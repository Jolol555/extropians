Is it agreed that knowledge is the supreme weapon.
<br>
<p>Anything can become a weapon... one silly example
<br>
<p>take 60 semiloads of tomatoes  over a year or so
<br>
add- knowledge of how to recognize the microbe producing botulism toxin in
<br>
spoiled food
<br>
<p>add- lease/rent/purchase of a small vinyard
<br>
<p>equals- a supply of botulism toxin large enough to kill tens of thousands
<br>
(millions )
<br>
<p>protect the protein so that it has a latentecy of 4-8 hours  (activation in the
<br>
colon)
<br>
<p>add  access to the water supply for the top 5 of say  beer suppliers.
<br>
<p>add toxin to line of  specific SKU of products.
<br>
<p>Coordinate this with prior knowledge of a one day multi-  million dollar
<br>
sweepstakes promotion for a product which will be in high demend for  only for a
<br>
single day, say  July 04 ( a time when early symptoms might be mis -diagnosed
<br>
, people are mobile.....)
<br>
<p>another senario- one that is more likely and dangerous
<br>
<p>malicious code is created which can reside in the common base of operating
<br>
systems for several years. Code like DNA or receptors might  be activated by
<br>
only specific instructions.  Perhaps even better this code is devised so that it
<br>
can be re-written each time an operating system is redone.  At some time it is
<br>
modified so that it can be activacted.
<br>
<p>Once activated it opens a system to further rewrite with the real destructive
<br>
code.
<br>
a coordinated attack would devise code specific to hundreds of different
<br>
applications
<br>
which would disable,disarm, render remote access and control to most program
<br>
controlled operations.  If this code were written today for release in say 6
<br>
years an army of operatives could be put into place worldwide  and this rogue
<br>
army would be able to do any malicous or lethal act any electronic device would
<br>
be capable of and do so in  a fully integrated fashion.
<br>
<p>The question is how except by creating an all encompassing AI(s) can the human
<br>
race protect itself from itself?
