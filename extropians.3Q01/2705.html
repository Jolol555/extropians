</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; any government services at all, then why even call if &quot;taxation&quot;?  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; taxation if it's chosen.  E.g., I'm not taxing my employer when I get

<em>&gt; paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for my work.  To define it otherwise would seem to me to be changing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; term beyond any useful meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not really. You pay a gas tax when you buy gas. If you don't buy gas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you pay no gas tax. This applies to all sales taxes. Tolls paid at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highway toll booths are similar: they are use based taxes, and you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choose to not use that which the tax is levied on. The registration fees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for your cars, boats, etc are also use based taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't disagree that these taxes exist now, but that they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary.  Surely, I can choose not to buy a boat.  I can also choose not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to own a house to avoid direct real estate taxes, not to work to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income taxes, not to buy or sell to avoid transaction taxes, not to invest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid...  You get the picture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A libertarian take on this is it's still initiating force.  I can't choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy tax free gas.  I can't choose to own real estate tax free.  Etc.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, I can't avoid these things in any nontrivial sense.  (Yeah, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid doing these things or I can do them and risk police action.)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is totally libertarian to pay such taxes, but only if they
<br>
properly reflect the externalities created by use of said items.
<br>
Refusing to pay your externalities is not libertarian, and IS imposing
<br>
force on others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A libertarian government properly focuses its revinue gathering on use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; based taxation, while fascist governments focus on confiscatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A libertarian government would not be able to tax period.  It might be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to charge user fees, but these would be for services the government actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivers.  A government doesn't deliver a service by forcing people to pay a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax.  This would include registration fees.  What if I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; register?  (A libertarian government might disavow protecting, say, my car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against theft or vandalism if I don't register it, but it would not be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use force to make me register.)
</em><br>
<p>A libertarian government would impose taxes to account for
<br>
externalities, and would properly funnel those externality fees to
<br>
mitigate the damage created by those externalities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this light, all taxation is confiscation.  It doesn't matter if it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax labeled a fee or not.  The deciding factor between a tax and an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price (the market word for what people pay for something) is whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiation of force is involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, your semilibertarian -- and it is that: only partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian -- government might be better than what we have now in any place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth, but it falls short of the principles you claim to be upholding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It mgiht be a good interim setup, between today's welfare state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow's libertarian society, but it should not be the goal.
</em><br>
<p>SOrry, a society that does not create some means of properly mitigating
<br>
externalities is not, and cannot hope to be in any way, libertarian.
