<p>
Aircraft are one issue that is long overdue for review, visual flight rules
<br>
over populated areas are asking for an accident, and they do happen too often.
<br>
<p>One very noticeable result is the quiet in my area. There aren't jets
<br>
stacked up all over the place and the rotary wing aircraft are gone. 
<br>
<p>Most of the residents have gotten sick of the noise from rotary wing
<br>
aircraft, especially the sightseeing helicopters which buzz the houses so
<br>
tourists might catch a peek of some celebrities sunbathing in the nude. The
<br>
terrorist attack has done more than all of the homeowner groups in the last
<br>
20 years have done to return some quiet to the city.
<br>
<p>Requiring all aircraft to file flight plans and limiting non essential
<br>
flights over residential areas is in my view not a bad idea.
<br>
<p>There is obviously a place for public safety (fire and police) helicopters.
<br>
Do we really need each TV station to have several aircraft in the air for
<br>
each car chase or evening traffic report?
<br>
