</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproductive cloning seems to be the wish to have a genetically related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child rather than a stranger, so even relatively few of the pro-cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; families would want Halliwell clones. But let's say culture changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means Geri Halliwell now has to compete with a thousand babies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They might get into her line of business after perhaps 15 years - at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which point it is extremely unlikely that the style and culture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the original successful will be in place, and the original is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to have changed to some other style. So they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors with each other, yes, but given the nature of a merket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy that simply implies that they can earn more by doing different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. Somehow I doubt all people with the Halliwell genome can do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music/looking good - the clones are very likely to find a wide variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of niches. 
</em><br>
<p>Some of the 15 year old Geri Halliwell clones are bound to emulate what
<br>
the original Geri Halliwell will be doing 15 years from now rather than
<br>
what she is doing now. So they are going to be competition. Even if we
<br>
assume for the sake of argument that the clones don't directly reduce the
<br>
original's market value, the original would still like to have control
<br>
over who can clone him so that he can gift or sell his clones. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if I'm very successful my genes might become widespread. Hmm, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds almost like an *incentive* for becoming successful to most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. (As for myself, I go the direct way and try to make my memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful - you will all end up as my mental clones! Muhahahah! ;-)=
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. People don't think in terms of wanting to make their
<br>
genes more widespread, because our genes haven't had a chance to co-evolve
<br>
with that recent meme. Maybe they will think that way eventually if
<br>
certain other things don't happen to make genes entirely obsolete, but
<br>
right now I think if you ask most people whether they mind being
<br>
involuntarily cloned, they would say yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure. It is a more serious problem, not just economically but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically. As Nick Szabo suggested at Extro 5, it is really one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core issues of posthuman freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Is his talk available online anywhere?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can hide it randomly in the genome, making the cloning far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive. OK, with full decompilation technology it could be done, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then cloning will be a relativiely trivial technology anyway and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could start designing encrypted genomes instead.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't aware you could hide genes like this. How would you go about
<br>
doing it so that you can't find the genes without full decompilation?
