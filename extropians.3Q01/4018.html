<em>&gt; In some respect, yes, I suppose it does.  The problem is that blacks

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Burch pointed out, they never got their 40 acres and a mule (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most cases).
</em><br>
<p>I'd dispute this. I've researched and found many accounts that are
<br>
online of people who got their 40 acres and a mule. The thing is that
<br>
all minor children who were slaves at the time the war ended never got
<br>
40 acres unless they were the oldest who inherited it from their father.
<br>
Additionally, the 40 acres and a mule in reparations only applied to
<br>
those who were adult male slaves in Confederate States, at the time the
<br>
end of the War. Previously freed and/or escaped slaves were not included
<br>
under the original reparations act, much in the way of people who void a
<br>
warranty by opening the case of their electronic device.....
<br>
<p>I'd bet that a majority of the blacks in the US never received their 40
<br>
acres and a mule during reconstruction because they were not adult males
<br>
who were still enslaved in Confederate states.
<br>
<p>There WAS a problem with local law enforcement in Confederate states
<br>
taking back the land of freed slaves in seizure actions to pay for
<br>
debts, real or fabricated, to white people, particularly farm
<br>
provisioners like general stores, etc. With local whites instituting
<br>
local gun control laws to prevent black farmers from having their
<br>
property seized, and Union occupation officers reporting on a number of
<br>
firefights resulting, this was the impetus for the congressional
<br>
Reconstruction Committee to institute the 14th amendment and refuse to
<br>
readmit any state that didn't ratify that amendment.
