Mark Walker writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps this is what Russell is talking about.  David [McDivitt] seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be speaking about moral relativism, which is a proper subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural relativism, e.g., one might be a relativist about moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths but a nonrelativist about scientific truths or vice-versa.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that does sound right (to be a non-relativist about truth but
<br>
to be a relativist about morality (i.e., what one approves of)).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you need to explain this a bit more. Relativists do not generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deny that morality exists--indeed, if anything the complaint against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativists is that they allow for a superabundance of morality. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkers that deny that morality exists. The Aussi philosopher J L Mackie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famously argued that all moral truths are false because there are no moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts, i.e., morality does not exist. Mackie and other error theorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Nietzsche is sometimes interpreted this way) do not say that moral truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are relative to some social group, rather all such claims are false.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds inconsistent to me.  In one sentence, Mackie allegedly
<br>
argues that there are no moral truths, and then in the next says that
<br>
they're false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly nonrelativists can allow that morality is not always the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same or must always be the same.  Variability might be a necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condition for moral relativism but it is not a sufficient condition.
</em><br>
<p>This is uselessly confusing IMO.  Why not just avoid using the &quot;M&quot;
<br>
word, e.g., never say &quot;That's immoral!!&quot;, &quot;we much teach morality
<br>
in the school&quot;, etc.?  A quite unnecessary (to me, at least until
<br>
you enlighten me) semantic quagmire opens up under us whenever we
<br>
try to discuss the &quot;M&quot; word in the abstract, instead of much more
<br>
usefully attacking the things we dislike or think are harmful to
<br>
people, e.g., adultery, disloyalty, brutality, political correctness,
<br>
divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, zenophobia, etc.
<br>
<p>I guess I have to go along with those who say that m******* is
<br>
relative, because that's closer to abandoning the term, and 
<br>
doesn't allude to something in the universe that no one has
<br>
ever seen.
