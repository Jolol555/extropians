gets of opportunity, and since black criminals move mainly within black cultural circles, most of their targets of opportunity are black.
<br>
<p>However, criminals generally do not target opportunistically. They plan,
<br>
they research, and they avoid areas with significant police presence, or
<br>
where private citizens are known to be well armed.
<br>
<p>While police generally do avoid minority areas, or at the least tend to
<br>
underserve them, primarily due to a reticence against starting a riot
<br>
every time they arrest a black criminal, it is a fact that gun ownership
<br>
among blacks is lower than among any other minority group, and less than
<br>
a quarter of the level among whites.
<br>
<p>If black criminals target other blacks, they do so specifically because
<br>
they know they have less chance of being caught or shot.
