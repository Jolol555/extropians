<p>No, that works fine Mike.  I calculate the density of xenon
<br>
hexaflouride would be, lets see, 131 + 6*19 = 245, so if XeF6
<br>
is inert to tissues then we could pull the same gag with about
<br>
100 atmospheres instead of 190.  Perhaps it would
<br>
also not have the anaesthetic effect of pure xenon?
<br>
<p>Wait, actually, I think I have a better idea anyway.
<br>
The trick would be to use the high pressure xenon bath
<br>
as a way to freeze corpses under pressure, so that the freezing
<br>
point is lowered way down.  That way perhaps the expansion
<br>
effect upon crystalization would be more manageable.  Also
<br>
the high pressure xenon would perhaps be a good way to
<br>
transmit heat effectively, allowing a fast cooling.
<br>
<p>Alternately, if the patient was terminally sick but still alive,
<br>
the xenon bath would perhaps give them a less painful way
<br>
to get cold before they perished, on the way to liquid nitrogen
<br>
temps.  The xenon would act as a painkiller, no?  Wouldnt
<br>
that make the notion of cryonics sell better, if the cryonauts
<br>
went down with a smile on their faces?  Seems like we
<br>
could arrange a mechanical device to... oh, wait, I just
<br>
remembered, we cant do that in there, cant breath fast enough.
<br>
<p>Any businessey types wanna go in with me on a patent?  Or shall
<br>
we toss the ideas out into the public domain?  Or did I just do
<br>
that?  How does that work?  If I patent an idea that I want
<br>
researchers to use freely, can I patent it and donate it to the
<br>
whole world?  Would that stop some luddite yahoo from
<br>
patenting the idea to prevent us proles from using it? spike
