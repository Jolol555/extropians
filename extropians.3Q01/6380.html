</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying we should not respond to an act of war as such?
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly what I am saying.  A futile response is worse than no
<br>
response.  We should respond only if we can find and successfully target
<br>
the people who were actually responsible.  We should not launch a
<br>
spasmodic, useless, civilian-killing military attack on a randomly
<br>
selected country just because &quot;we have to do something&quot;.
<br>
<p>Terrorists don't strike at the US because they think they can get away
<br>
with it.  Terrorists strike at the US because they hate the US and feel
<br>
that &quot;they have to do something&quot;, no matter what the cost is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How exactly would this make future terrorism using suitcase or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger nukes or a bioweapon less likely than if we took out as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many major terrorist cells as we can find?
</em><br>
<p>Neither one will make it less likely, so we may as well focus on trying to
<br>
reduce some of the underlying hate by actually obeying international law
<br>
for a change.  A moderate, lawful response by the US at this point, a
<br>
response that doesn't involve invading other countries just because we can
<br>
get away with it, might have a real emotional impact in the minds of the
<br>
countries that believe, correctly, in the arrogance of the US.  That's how
<br>
Martin Luther King scored his victory.  Following international law even
<br>
after a major bombing would send a message that the US is willing to
<br>
choose to play by the same rules imposed on non-superpowers.  It wouldn't
<br>
halt terrorism but it might decrease the growth rate.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine the righteous indignation if Afghanistan were to mount a
<br>
military attack on the US under similar circumstances?  That is the
<br>
essence of the United States's arrogance - a double standard backed up by
<br>
superior military force.  It is that unbearable unfairness which creates
<br>
the burning hatred and the willingness to attack, regardless of the
<br>
consequences, just because it's so unbearable to think that the Americans
<br>
can bomb and bomb and never be touched themselves.
<br>
<p>It's not just a cycle of hatred, it's a cycle of futile hatred.  The
<br>
terrorist attacks on America will do nothing to reduce America's
<br>
arrogance.  America's military actions will do nothing to reduce the
<br>
likelihood of future terrorist attacks.  Domestic security measures will
<br>
likewise fail.  Even if America did start behaving correctly, the hatred
<br>
would still be too ingrained for the terrorist attacks to stop.  The cycle
<br>
will continue, running on its own wheels, generating new terrorist attacks
<br>
and indignant First World military responses, until technological changes
<br>
to the underlying society (transparency, Earthweb, Singularity) remove the
<br>
causes or prohibit the effects of terrorism.
<br>
<p>I agree that taking out all the big, organized, technologically adept
<br>
terrorist cells, or reducing them, or reducing most of them, would
<br>
significantly decrease the probability of a WOMD terrorist attack for at
<br>
least the next several years.  I would still expect conventional attacks,
<br>
and I would not expect to be safe forever.
