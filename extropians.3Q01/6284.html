<p><p><em>&gt; I dont think anyone is saying that the tens of thousands of doomed people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who had to get up and work thier crappy jobs like everyone else in the
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; deserved to be burned, suffocated, or crushed to death at the WTC, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the airplanes going home to see loved ones or working thier
</em><br>
crappy
<br>
<em>&gt; jobs to feed thier families  deserved to be slashed, crushed, burned, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed in general.  No one is saying that these people deserved to die.
</em><br>
If
<br>
<em>&gt; we want to combat terrorism, there is no way you can lock down the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to ever make it safe.  No amount of Xray machines, face scanners,
</em><br>
ID
<br>
<em>&gt; cards, barcodes of foreheads, or DNA tags will ever make it completely
</em><br>
safe.
<br>
<em>&gt; You have to remove the incentive people have to be terrorist.  In this
</em><br>
case,
<br>
<em>&gt; it is national hatred for the US, this hatred comes from the US policing
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the entire world.  Bin Ladden specifically said that every US citizen is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid military target in response to the US's military involvement in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; palestine.  The US was not attacked because 'it was a beacon of freedom'
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; BUsh said so melodramatically, it was attacked because we have been doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things in other peoples countries to piss them off.  Stop pissing these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other countries off (that is, remove the military presence which is a
</em><br>
direct
<br>
<em>&gt; represnetation of the US as a country) and no longer does anyone breed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hatred of the US and want to kill every working US citizen.  Has Sweden
</em><br>
ever
<br>
<em>&gt; been terrorist attacked?  The only way to get rid of terrorism is to
</em><br>
remove
<br>
<em>&gt; the incentive people have to commit it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>I'm trying to consider what items to list that Americans and/or it's
<br>
government should stop doing to appease or prevent Islamic terrorism.
<br>
<p>1) Provide no humanitarian or military support to Israel?
<br>
2) Stop trading with Israel?
<br>
3) Revoke American recognition of the State of Israel?
<br>
4) Kick all Jews out of America?
<br>
<p>A list of all the requirements to appease terrorists could be quite long and
<br>
ugly.
<br>
<p>How would you respond to a demand by terrorist that we replace American
<br>
government and laws for Islamic fundaments ones or for such legal changes as
<br>
making it illegal for women to work or to be seen without an escort or veil?
<br>
<p>While I'm convinced that Israel has played downright dirty and hid it well,
<br>
I'm not convinced that anything that Americans could do would satisfy
<br>
terrorists short of placing terrorists feet on American necks.  Killing
<br>
innocent people is not a cry for justice, it's a cry for power.
<br>
<p>I find very reasonable Samuel P. Huntington's argument in his book _The
<br>
Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order_ that the large
<br>
generation of disenfranchised youth within Islamic countries as the primary
<br>
source of government instability there, terrorism inclusive.
