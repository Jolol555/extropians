<p>The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commision says, at

<p>: Q: What would happen if a large commercial airliner was intentionally
<br>
: crashed into a nuclear power plant?
<br>
:
<br>
: A:. Nuclear power plants have inherent capability to protect public
<br>
: health and safety through such features as robust containment buildings,
<br>
: redundant safety systems, and highly trained operators. They are among the
<br>
: most hardened structures in the country and are designed to withstand
<br>
: extreme events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes. In
<br>
: addition, all NRC licenses with significant radiological material have
<br>
: emergency response plans to enable the mitigation of impacts on the
<br>
: public in the event of a release. However, the NRC did not specifically
<br>
: contemplate attacks by aircraft such as Boeing 757s or 767s and nuclear
<br>
: power plants were not designed to withstand such crashes. Detailed
<br>
: engineering analyses of a large airliner crash have not yet been
<br>
: performed.
<br>
<p>It sounds like it could well be a problem.  I think I read something about
<br>
putting anti-aircraft missiles at nuclear sites.  Unfortunately they
<br>
won't get much warning since it may not be obvious that a plane is off
<br>
course until it's very close.
