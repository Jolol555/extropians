<em>&gt; False dichotomy warning: Legal positivism and natural law are not

necessarily
<br>
<em>&gt; opposites.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about that.  My understanding of thinkers like John Austin is
<br>
that by legal positivism they mean what laws that exist are ones that must
<br>
be and questions of what should be are unimportant.  It's possible, in this
<br>
context, to have a legal positivist inside a libertarian society agreeing
<br>
with libertarian laws, BUT that would only be by coincidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although most positivists embrace statism, they need not.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  My argument is not what concrete positions they take, but with
<br>
their methodology as I understand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Positivism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly construed, merely requires that we define &quot;law&quot; by reference to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; rules that effectively control human social behavior.  Nor, though many
</em><br>
do,
<br>
<em>&gt; need an advocate of natural law adopt the view that natural laws come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God, or Kantian edicts, or other such noumenal realms.  Advocates of
</em><br>
natural
<br>
<em>&gt; law can embrace a positivist methodology, arguing that natural laws are
</em><br>
those
<br>
<em>&gt; that in practice prove effective--&quot;natural&quot; if you will--to ordering human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies.  See, e.g., Hayek's explanation of the evolution of law.
</em><br>
<p>Aside from the problem with Hayekian social theory -- a theory I generally
<br>
agree with -- I've never maintained that natural law or individual rights
<br>
have to be based on those things.  In fact, my mentioning of the Objectivist
<br>
view later in the same email should have led you to believe otherwise.
<br>
(That said, I would not be so hard on Kant.  I don't see him and Rand as the
<br>
intellectual rivals she would have us believe they are.)
<br>
<p>And now the problem with Hayek.  While there are unintended consequences and
<br>
these play a big role -- perhaps the biggest role -- in shaping society, we
<br>
cannot sheepishly accept whatever is as be the thing that should have been.
<br>
To do so only leads to circularity.  For example, we would have to embrace
<br>
whatever legal contradictions that exist because these, after all, evolved.
<br>
This would include the welfare state, Communism (when it existed), and the
<br>
like.  This would lead to a quetist conservative attitude toward politics
<br>
and the law.
<br>
<p>The truth is both intentions and unintended consequences matter in
<br>
explaining and changing society.  Regarding the relation between the two, we
<br>
must be aware that when we act, we don't always get what we want -- that
<br>
there are limits on what can be done.  (See Chris Sciabarra's _Marx, Hayek,
<br>
and Utopia_ for a  detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of
<br>
Hayek's views.  Also, his _Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical
<br>
Libertarianism_ contains a brief discussion of Hayek in relation to other
<br>
dialectical libertarians.  See his web site at
