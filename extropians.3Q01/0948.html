I had asked,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Samantha and Amara have defended spirituality, synchronicity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and (I think) religiosity.  I want to get down to the truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of what's really going on here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Why do some people gladly debunk what they see as clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    falsehoods where others, equally skeptical, don't want to?
</em><br>
<p>Samantha provided the helpful answer
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) perhaps we don't consider skepticism inherently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestionably true or good for all purposes.
</em><br>
<p>Would you elaborate?  Now I'll admit that there are many ordinary
<br>
day-to-day situations in life where *speaking* skeptically isn't
<br>
to the point, e.g., your boss tells a funny but highly improbable
<br>
story, your brother tells your sister that the meatloaf was
<br>
superb, or you visit a friend's church just out of curiosity.
<br>
<p>But I care a lot about what I think, and I can't think of any
<br>
reason not to have a skeptical attitude about what is and what
<br>
is not to be believed.  You probably also care a lot about what
<br>
you think.  Don't you ALWAYS want to be skeptical of memes as
<br>
you encounter them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. Why do the latter embrace terms, e.g., &quot;spirituality&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &quot;synchronicity&quot; overwhelmingly used by people who mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    things completely different from them?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; About the latter question, there is no shortage of words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phrases in English to distinguish shades of belief.  Articulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people could easily always find suitable substitution phrases---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but they didn't do so, and mostly resist doing so.  Why?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Because what I am speaking of is spiritual in the truest sense I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know and to call it anything else is imho improper.  It is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential if one is to reclaim spirituality from the worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the luddites and from the conceptual shrinking it into something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily dismissed that too easily misses and disowns what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe is important in it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that terms are often worth fighting for.  But I will
<br>
wax sympathetic here by giving a very parallel case of my own,
<br>
where, perhaps it turns out that I'm doing the same thing as
<br>
you are---or perhaps not.
<br>
<p>I think that it's best to admit that we have &quot;free will&quot;.  True,
<br>
I am a strict materialist who thinks even people and complex
<br>
computer programs are entirely mechanical.  So why &quot;free will&quot;.
<br>
I say that it's simply easist to go on saying that we have free
<br>
will---and so does an extremely complicated program when it
<br>
weighs a lot of evidence and finally comes to a decision, because
<br>
as soon as we start saying that we *do not* have free will, we
<br>
are beset by all sorts of difficulties.
<br>
<p>Now (thinking out loud here) is your case parallel?  Perhaps it
<br>
is.  Right now I can't think of why it's not.  Can anyone?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now a semanticist might retort, &quot;because the term in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has so many favorable semantic links, that it's very useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the purposes of communication&quot;.  But if this were the case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then you'd see people who use terms like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and &quot;synchronicity&quot; qualifying their remarks.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the terms would always be followed by words like &quot;in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of...&quot;, or &quot;-like&quot;, or surrounded by scare-quotes.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't happen.  Why?
</em><br>
<p>Whenever I mention free will, it is ALWAYS in a context that
<br>
allows me to thoroughly separate myself from people who believe
<br>
in souls, and I vigorously criticize non-materialist beliefs
<br>
as I do so.
<br>
<p>That's maybe what is not parallel in our cases.  Do you actively
<br>
separate yourself from all those &quot;luddites&quot; as you called them,
<br>
by also ALWAYS disparaging their beliefs while putting forth 
<br>
your own about &quot;spirituality&quot;?
<br>
