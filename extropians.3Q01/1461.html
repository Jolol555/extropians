<em>&gt;From: &quot;Smigrodzki, Rafal&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107191443.HAA26138@well.com&gt;">SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I can't resist joining in the discussion about health care - maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because I am busy with it about 12 hours/day, leaving too little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time for the extropian thing. 
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is a very important moral issue involved in paying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medical care with tax-derived funds - namely, isn't it morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong to take money under duress, (the IRS), ultimately backed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a threat of death, to pay for other persons' life-saving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedures?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I would say it depends.
</em><br>
<p>I would say you are incorrect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are some people who just don't care much about their health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- they smoke, drive drunk, blow their cortical vessels with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cocaine, and then come to depend on public largesse for treatment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other support, without ever paying a dime into the pool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insurance money. I would have no compunction about letting them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rely on private charity for their needs.
</em><br>
<p>We agree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But then, there are other people, those who you are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking about - the nice, hard-working, regular folks, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sincerely want to pay but just happen to make too little money for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;full insurance, after paying for food, rent, utilities, kids'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;college fund. I am willing to help them, to some extent, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support the use of governmental oppression to force other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens to help, too.
</em><br>
<p>Well, with the &quot;support the use of governmental oppression to force
<br>
other citizens to help too.&quot; we part company, the second force is
<br>
applied we are not talking about citizens, but subjects.
<br>
<p>If people cannot afford to have children, then they shouldn't do
<br>
so. I should not be required to pay for their choices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How would you know that somebody is nice and honestly willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pay their health bills? And, another important element, not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persons have the same needs - there are people willing to spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their last dime on nutritional supplements and the best medicine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is. Others, having 10 000$ to spend, might allocate only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few hundred dollars for health, and prefer to spend the rest on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Caribbean cruise.
</em><br>
<p>Don't need to know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that a workable and fair system would offer tiered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government-standardized but privately run insurance plans to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens. 
</em><br>
<p>You're not talking government standardized, you're talking
<br>
government subsidized.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The difference between the actuarial, free-market cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insurance, and the premiums paid, would be covered by tax money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The system would encourage diligent shopping for the best plan at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the lowest cost, because the customers would be paying a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own money, in terms of percentage of their disposable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;income. However, nobody would be denied care because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inability to pay.
</em><br>
<p>The difference would be payed by me, as I already indicated I don't
<br>
see this as fair.
<br>
<p>I vote no.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Thus, even the poorest, but very health conscious person could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afford the best medicine. Those who would want to spend some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their disposable income on, let's say, lipstick, would pay only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;percentage of the DI, and receive less care, assuming the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personal responsibility for their choices.
</em><br>
<p>With my help, administered with a gun to my head, no thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nobody would get hurt, except by their own nonchalance, and nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would get a free ride either.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, nobody would get hurt as long as I &quot;cooperate&quot;. No thanks!
