<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;000001c12c9f$ee6e6900$10031c18@cosmicv&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You neglect the impact of  economies of scale. Right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there isnt much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an impact, but if all schools were private, the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pronounced. Besides, theres no studies that show a difference in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of education declining if classroom sizes increase from say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 30 to 50. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sounds like there should be, but it reality, if you have 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dont have a lot of time with individual students anyways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Double the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the class and you can drop prices dramatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me be sure I have this straight...  You are suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (free) public school where the student:teacher ratio is ~
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 30:1 and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every family pay $2K - $5K per year (per kid) for a school where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; student:teacher ratio is 50:1?  Is that *really* what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am I missing something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<p>I'm suggesting getting rid of public schools for private and letting the
<br>
private school decide how to do its job. If you dont like a low cost, high
<br>
volume school, dont go to it. You'll have a choice to go where ever you want
<br>
and can afford. Its the same point as to why it cost more now to hire a
<br>
private full time tutor then go to private school. If you want to be cheap,
<br>
send your kid to the K-mart version (as if those types of schools didn't
<br>
already exist). I would expect the norm classroom size to stay about where
<br>
it is and the cost of doing it to drop a good chunk with private industry
<br>
doing it. Your choice here is McDonalds Hamburgers, eating at nice dinner at
<br>
Chilis retaurant, or Filet Mingon from an expensive restaurant. All options
<br>
would be available!
