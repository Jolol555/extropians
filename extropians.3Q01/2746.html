<em>&gt;From THE SPIKE:
</em><br>
============================
<br>
Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended. (Vernor Vinge, NASA VISION-21 Symposium, 1993)
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Why this curious and unfamiliar term `singularity'? It's a mathematical point where analysis breaks down, where infinities enter an equation. ...`The term &quot;singularity&quot; tied to the notion of radical change is very evocative,' Vinge told me, adding: `I used the term &quot;singularity&quot; in the
<br>
sense of a place where a model of physical reality fails. (I was also attracted to the term by one of the characteristics of many singularities in General Relativity--namely the unknowability of things close to or in the singularity.).'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
For Vinge, accelerating trends in computer sciences converge somewhere between 2030 and 2100 to form a wall of technological novelties blocking the future from us. However hard we try, we cannot plausibly imagine what lies beyond that wall. `My &quot;technological singularity&quot; is really quite limited,' Vinge told me. `I say that it seems plausible that in the near historical future, we will cause superhuman intelligences to exist. Prediction beyond that point is qualitatively different from futurisms of
<br>
the past. I don't necessarily see any vertical asymptotes.' So enthusiasts for this perspective (including me) are taking the idea much farther than
<br>
Vinge. Humanity, it is argued, will become first `transhuman' and then `posthuman'. 
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
Then there's the rest of the book.

<p>Damien Broderick has spoken.  I would say that about covers it. 
<br>
<p>Oh, and buy the book.  I did and found it excellent.  
<br>
<p>best wishes,
