<p><em>&gt; No doubt, people who fit those descriptions are definitely racists.  But my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is that we all make snap judgments and decisions about people based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their race.  This makes us just as racist as the folks you describe above, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't you think?
</em><br>
<p>That doesn't have a simple answer, in my opinion.  If you mean
<br>
&quot;snap judgment&quot; in terms of how hazard it is to find that (in
<br>
a certain neighborhood) you are being followed by a black or
<br>
by an Italian, no; it's not racist at all to consider the odds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Question (answer honestly):  You're waiting for an elevator, two elevator 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doors open at the same time, you're an an equal distance away from both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doors, in one elevator is a white guy, in the other is a black guy.  Which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elevator do you get into?
</em><br>
<p>I live in California, and neither in Riverside nor in the south bay
<br>
has it ever mattered.  I definitely wouldn't be conscious of the race
<br>
of the single inhabitant of the elevator.  (A big group might be
<br>
different.)  At least it has never mattered in the buildings in
<br>
whose elevators I would ride.  I admit that in some cities and in
<br>
some neighborhoods I might be foolish for not being more
<br>
discriminating under some conditions.
