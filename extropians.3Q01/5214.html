<em>&gt;From: &quot;Zero Powers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20schools&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108281918.MAA02711@well.com&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I don't think anyone here is advocating socialism.  I certainly am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not. But there are alternatives other than unregulated markets on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one hand and totalitarian socialist regimes on the other.  Though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;die hard libertarians will disagree, free enterprise mixed with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoonful of socially responsible regulation can go a long way.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, history books are filled with the excesses of capitalism,
<br>
which is where a good minimalist democratic government comes in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unrest (think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;French Revolution).
</em><br>
<p>Huge discrepencies may have helped play a part, but it was the long
<br>
mandatory hours and other deplorable conditions that gave rise to
<br>
the labor movement.
<br>
<p>Today we still have the great discrepencies in income, but many
<br>
clever people have managed to avoid the problems this formally
<br>
caused.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From another post:
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That analogy doesn't work.  Its not like Ford was giving away free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cars, and then someone proposed that he stop giving them away for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free.  When the market for cars was young, they were a luxury. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Education is a necessity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a vital necessity, but that doesn't mean that the people who
<br>
descide to have children are exempt from paying the real world
<br>
costs.
<br>
<p>This could not happen immediately of course, but you could have a
<br>
transistion (at least 9 months long).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Besides, when you say those goods are available to the &quot;average
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person&quot; aren't you really talking about the middle classes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above?  Where I'm from *poor* people still mostly use public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transportation.
</em><br>
<p>I'm supposedly middle class, but I take public transportation every
<br>
day, it's an urban thing.... ;)
