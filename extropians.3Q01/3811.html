<p>BODY: 
<br>
Do mysterious and presumably endangered manlike creatures inhabit swamplands
<br>
of the southern United States? If not, how do we explain the sightings and
<br>
even track impressions of creatures that thus far have eluded mainstream
<br>
science? Do they represent additional evidence of the legendary Bigfoot or
<br>
something else entirely? What would an investigation reveal?
<br>
<p>Monster Mania 
<br>
<p>The outside world learned about Louisiana's Honey Island Swamp Monster in
<br>
1974 when two hunters emerged from a remote area of backwater sloughs with
<br>
plaster casts of &quot;unusual tracks.&quot; The men claimed they discovered the
<br>
footprints near a wild boar that lay with its throat gashed. They also
<br>
stated that over a decade earlier, in 1963, they had seen similar tracks
<br>
after encountering an awesome creature. They described it as standing seven
<br>
feet tall, being covered with grayish hair, and having large amber-colored
<br>
eyes. However, the monster had promptly run away and an afternoon rainstorm
<br>
had obliterated its tracks, the men said.
<br>
<p>The hunters were Harlan E. Ford and his friend Billy Mills, both of whom
<br>
worked as air-traffic controllers. Ford told his story on an episode of the
<br>
1970s television series In Search of ... According to his granddaughter,
<br>
Dana Holyfield (1999a, 11):
<br>
<p>When the documentary was first televised, it was monster mania around here.
<br>
People called from everywhere ... The legend of the Honey Island Swamp
<br>
Monster escalated across Southern Louisiana and quickly made its way our of
<br>
state after the documentary aired nationwide.
<br>
<p>Harlan Ford continued to search for the monster until his death in 1980.
<br>
Dana recalls how he once rook a goat into the swamp to use as bait, hoping
<br>
to lure the creature to a tree blind where Ford waited--uneventfully, as it
<br>
happened--with gun and camera. He did supposedly find several,
<br>
different-sized tracks on one hunting trip. He also claimed to have seen the
<br>
monster on one other occasion, during a fishing trip with Mills and some of
<br>
their friends from work. One of the men reportedly then went searching for
<br>
the creature with a rifle and fired two shots at it before returning to tell
<br>
his story to the others around the campfire (Holyfield 1999a, 10-15).
<br>
<p>Searching for Evidence
<br>
<p>Intrigued by the monster reports, which I pursued on a trip to New Orleans
<br>
(speaking to local skeptics at the planetarium in Kenner), I determined to
<br>
visit the alleged creature's habitat. The Honey Island Swamp (figure 1)
<br>
comprises nearly 70,000 acres between the East Pearl and West Pearl rivers.
<br>
I signed on with Honey Island Swamp Tours, which is operated out of Slidell,
<br>
Louisiana, by wetlands ecologist Paul Wagner and his wife, Sue Their &quot;small,
<br>
personalized nature tours&quot; live up to their billing as explorations of &quot;the
<br>
deeper, harder-to-reach small bayous and sloughs&quot; of &quot;one of the wildest and
<br>
most pristine river swamps in America&quot; (&quot;Dr. Wagner's&quot; n.d.).
<br>
<p>The Wagners are ambivalent about the supposed swamp monsters existence. They
<br>
have seen alligators, deer, otters, bobcats, and numerous other species but
<br>
not a trace of the legendary creature (Wagner 2000). The same is true of the
<br>
Wagners' Cajun guide, Captain Robbie Charbonnet. Beginning at age eight, he
<br>
has had forty-five years' experience, eighteen as a guide, in the Honey
<br>
Island Swamp. He told me he had never seen or heard&quot; something he could not
<br>
identify, certainly nothing that could be attributed to a monster
<br>
(Charbonnet 2000). 
<br>
<p>Suiting action to words throughout our tour, Charbonnet repeatedly
<br>
identified species after species in the remote swampland as he skillfully
<br>
threaded his boat through the cypresses and tupelos hung with Spanish moss.
<br>
Although the cool weather had pushed 'gators to the depths, he heralded
<br>
turtles, great blue herons, and other wildlife. From only a glimpse of its
<br>
silhouetted form he spotted a barred owl, then carefully maneuvered for a
<br>
closer view. He called attention to the singing of robins, who were
<br>
gathering there for the winter, and pointed to signs of other creatures,
<br>
including freshly cut branches produced by beavers and, in the mud, tracks
<br>
left by a wild boar. But there was not a trace of the swamp monster. (The
<br>
closest I came was passing an idle boat at Indian Village Landing emblazoned
<br>
&quot;Swamp Monster Tours.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Another who is skeptical of monster claims is naturalist John V. Dennis. In
<br>
his comprehensive book The Great Cypress Swamps (1988), he writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;Honey Island has achieved fame of sorts because of the real or imagined
<br>
presence of a creature that fits the description of the Big Foot of movie
<br>
renown. Known as the Thing, the creature is sometimes seen by fishermen.&quot;
<br>
However, he says, &quot;For my part, let me say that in my many years of visiting
<br>
swamps, many of them as wild or wilder than Honey Island, I have never
<br>
obtained a glimpse of anything vaguely resembling Big Foot, nor have I ever
<br>
seen suspicious-looking footprints.&quot; He concludes, &quot;Honey Island, in my
<br>
experience, does not live up to its reputation as a scary place.&quot;
<br>
<p>In contrast to the lack of monster experiences from swamp experts are the
<br>
encounters reported by Harlan Ford and Billy Mills. Those alleged
<br>
eyewitnesses are, in investigators' parlance, &quot;repeaters&quot;--people who claim
<br>
unusual experiences on multiple occasions. (Take Bigfoot hunter Roger
<br>
Patterson for example. Before shooting his controversial film sequence of a
<br>
hairy man-beast in 1967, Patterson was a longtime Bigfoot buff who had
<br>
&quot;discovered&quot; the alleged creature's tracks on several occasions [Bord and
<br>
Bord 1982, 80].) Ford's and Mills's multiple sightings and discoveries seem
<br>
suspiciously lucky, and suspicions are increased by other evidence,
<br>
including the tracks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Dana Holyfield I obtained a plaster copy of one of the several track
</em><br>
casts made by her grandfather (figure 2). It is clearly not the track of a
<br>
stereotypical Bigfoot (or sasquatch) whose footprints are &quot;roughly human in
<br>
design,&quot; according to anthropologist and pro-Bigfoot theorist Grover Krantz
<br>
(1992, 17). Instead, Ford's monster tracks are webbed-toe imprints that
<br>
appear to be &quot;a cross between a primate and a large alligator&quot; (Holyfield
<br>
1999a, 9). The track is also surprisingly small: only about nine and
<br>
three-fourths inches long compared to Bigfoot tracks which average about
<br>
fourteen to sixteen inches (Coleman and Clark 1999, 14), with tracks of
<br>
twenty inches and more reported (Coleman and Huyghe 1999). [1]
<br>
<p>Monsterlands 
<br>
<p>Clearly, the Honey Island Swamp Monster is not a Bigfoot, a fact that robs
<br>
Ford's and Mills's story of any credibility it might have had from that
<br>
association. Monster popularizers instead equate the Honey Island reports
<br>
with other &quot;North American 'Creatures of the Black Lagoon' cases,&quot; purported
<br>
evidence of cryptozoological entities dubbed &quot;freshwater Merbeings&quot; (Coleman
<br>
and Huyghe 1999, 39, 62).
<br>
<p>These are supposedly linked by tracks with three toes, although Ford's casts
<br>
actually exhibit four (again see figure 2). In short, the alleged monster is
<br>
unique, rare even among creatures whose existence is unproven and unlikely.
<br>
<p>Footprints and other specific details aside, the Honey Island Swamp Monster
<br>
seems part of a genre of mythic swamp-dwelling &quot;beastmen&quot; or &quot;manimals.&quot;
<br>
They include the smelly Skunk Ape and the hybrid Gatorman of the Florida
<br>
Everglades and other southern swamps; the Scape Ore Swamp Lizardman of South
<br>
Carolina; Momo, the Missouri Monster; and, among others, the Fouke Monster,
<br>
which peeked in the window of a home in Fouke, Arkansas, one night in 1971
<br>
and set off a rash of monster sightings (Blackman 1998, 23-25, 30-33,
<br>
166-168; Bord and Bord 1982, 104-105; Coleman and Clark 1999, 224-226;
<br>
Coleman and Huyghe 1999, 39, 56).
<br>
<p>Considering this genre, we must ask: Why swamps and why monsters? Swamps
<br>
represent remote, unexplored regions, which have traditionally been the
<br>
domain of legendary creatures. As the noted Smithsonian Institution
<br>
biologist John Napier (1973, 23) sagely observed, monsters &quot;hail from
<br>
uncharted territory: inaccessible mountains, impenetrable forests, remote
<br>
Pacific islands, the depths of loch or ocean.... The essential element of
<br>
the monster myth is remoteness.&quot;
<br>
<p>Echoing Napier in discussing one reported Honey Island Swamp encounter, John
<br>
V. Dennis (1988) states: &quot;In many cases, sightings such as this one are
<br>
inspired by traditions that go back as far as Indian days. If a region is
<br>
wild and inaccessible and has a history of encounters with strange forms of
<br>
life, chances are that similar encounters will occur again--or at least be
<br>
reported.&quot; And while the major purported domain of Bigfoot is the Pacific
<br>
northwest, Krantz (1992, 199) observes: &quot;Many of the more persistent eastern
<br>
reports come from low-lying and/or swampy lands of the lower Mississippi and
<br>
other major river basins.&quot;
<br>
<p>But why does belief in monsters persist? According to one source, monsters
<br>
appear in every culture and are &quot;born out of the unknown and nurtured by the
<br>
unexplained&quot; (Guenette and Guenette 1975). Many alleged paranormal entities
<br>
appear to stem either from mankind's hopes or fears--thus are envisioned
<br>
angels and demons--and some entities may evoke a range of responses.
<br>
Monsters, for example, may intrigue us with their unknown aspect as well as
<br>
provoke terror. We may be especially interested in man-beasts, given what
<br>
psychologist Robert A. Baker (1995) observes is our strong tendency to endow
<br>
things with human characteristics. Hence, angels are basically our better
<br>
selves with wings; extraterrestrials are humanoids from futuristic worlds;
<br>
and Bigfoot and his ilk seem linked to our evolutionary past.
<br>
<p>Monsters may play various roles in our lives. My Cajun guide, Robbie
<br>
Charbonnet, offered some interesting ideas about the Honey Island Swamp
<br>
Monster and similar entities. He thought that frightening stories might have
<br>
been concocted on occasion to keep outsiders away--perhaps to protect prime
<br>
hunting areas or even help safeguard moonshine stills. He also theorized
<br>
that such tales might have served in a sort of bogeyman fashion to frighten
<br>
children from wandering into remote, dangerous areas. (Indeed he mentioned
<br>
how when he was a youngster in the 1950s an uncle would tell him about a
<br>
frightening figure--a sort of horror-movie type with one leg, a mutilated
<br>
face, etc.--that would &quot;get&quot; him if he strayed into the swampy wilderness.)
<br>
<p>Like any such bogeyman, the Honey Island Swamp Monster is also good for
<br>
gratuitous campfire chills. &quot;A group of men were sitting around the campfire
<br>
along the edge of the Pearl River,&quot; begins one narrative, &quot;telling stories
<br>
about that thing in the swamp . . .&quot; (Holyfield 1999b). A song, &quot;The Honey
<br>
Island Swamp Monster&quot; (written by Perry Ford, n.d.), is in a similar vein:
<br>
&quot;Late at night by a dim fire light, / You people best beware. / He's
<br>
standing in the shadows, / Lurking around out there...&quot; The monster has even
<br>
been referred to specifically as &quot;The boogie man&quot; and &quot;that booger&quot;
<br>
(Holyfield 1992a, 14). &quot;Booger&quot; is a dialect form of bogey, and deliberately
<br>
scary stories are sometimes known as &quot;booger' tales&quot; (Cassidy 1985).
<br>
<p>Suitable subjects for booger tales are numerous Louisiana swamp and bayou
<br>
terrors, many of them the products of Cajun folklore. One is the Letiche, a
<br>
ghoulish creature that was supposedly an abandoned, illegitimate child who
<br>
was reared by alligators, and now has scaly skin, webbed hands and feet, and
<br>
luminous green eyes. Then there is Jack O'Lantern, a malevolent spirit who
<br>
lures humans into dangerous swampland with his mesmerizing lantern, as well
<br>
as the Loup Garou (a werewolf) and the zombies (not the relatively harmless
<br>
&quot;Voodoo Zombies&quot; but the horrific &quot;Flesh Eaters&quot;) (Blackman 1998, 171-209).
<br>
<p>By extension, swamp creatures are also ideal subjects for horror fiction.
<br>
The Fouke monster sightings, for example, inspired the horror movie The
<br>
Legend of Boggy Creek. That 1972 thriller became a box-office hit, spawning
<br>
a sequel and many imitations. About the same time (1972) there emerged a
<br>
popular comic book series titled Swamp Thing, featuring a metamorphosing
<br>
man-monster from a Louisiana swamp. Interestingly, these popularized
<br>
monsters predated the 1974 claims of Ford and Mills. (Recall that their
<br>
alleged earlier encounter of 1963 had not been reported.)
<br>
<p>The Track Makers 
<br>
<p>While swamp monsters and other manbeasts are not proven to exist, hoaxers
<br>
certainly are. Take, for example, Bigfoot tracks reported by berry pickers
<br>
near Mount St. Helens, Washington, in 1930. Nearly half a century later, a
<br>
retired logger came forward to pose with a set of &quot;bigfeet&quot; that he had
<br>
carved and that a friend had worn to produce the fake monster tracks
<br>
(Dennett 1982). Among many similar hoaxes were at least seven perpetrated in
<br>
the early 1970s by one Ray Pickens of Chehalis, Washington. He carved
<br>
primitive seven-by-eighteen-inch feet and attached them to hiking boots.
<br>
Pickens (1975) said he was motivated &quot;not to fool the scientists, but to
<br>
fool the monster-hunters&quot; who he felt regarded people like him as &quot;hicks.&quot;
<br>
Other motivation, according to monster hunter Peter Byrne (1975), stems from
<br>
the &quot;extraordinary psychology of people wanting to get their names in the
<br>
paper, people wanting a little publicity, wanting to be noticed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Were Harlan Ford's and Billy Mills's monster claims similarly motivated?
<br>
Dana Holyfield (1999a, 5-6) says of her grandfather: &quot;Harlan wasn't a man to
<br>
make up something like that. He was down to earth and honest and told it the
<br>
way it was and didn't care if people believed him or not.&quot; But even a
<br>
basically honest person, who would not do something overtly dastardly or
<br>
criminal, might engage in something that he considered relatively harmless
<br>
and that would add zest to life. I believe the evidence strongly indicates
<br>
that Ford and Mills did just that. To sum up, there are the men's
<br>
suspiciously repeated sighting reports and alleged track discoveries,
<br>
together with the incongruent mixing of a Bigfoot-type creature with most
<br>
un-Bigfootlike feet, plus the fact that the proffered evidence is not only
<br>
of a type that could easily be faked but often has been. In addition, the
<br>
men's claims exist in a context of swampmanimal mythology that has numerous
<br>
antecedent elements in folklore and fiction. Taken together, the evi dence
<br>
suggests a common hoax.
<br>
<p>Certainly, in the wake of the monster mania Ford helped inspire, much
<br>
hoaxing resulted. States Holyfield (1999a, 11): &quot;Then there were the monster
<br>
impersonators who made fake bigfoot shoes and tromped through the swamp.
<br>
This went on for years. Harlan didn't worry about the jokers because he knew
<br>
the difference.&quot; Be that as it may, swamp-monster hoaxes---and apparent
<br>
hoaxes--continue. 
<br>
<p>A few months before I arrived in Louisiana, two loggers, Earl Whitstine and
<br>
Carl Dubois, reported sighting a hairy man-beast in a cypress swamp called
<br>
Boggy Bayou in the central part of the state. Giant four-toed tracks and
<br>
hair samples were discovered at the site, and soon others came forward to
<br>
say they too had seen a similar creature. However, there were grounds for
<br>
suspicion: twenty-five years earlier (i.e., not long after the 1974 Honey
<br>
Island Swamp Monster reports), Whitstine's father and some friends had sawed
<br>
giant foot shapes from plywood and produced fake monster tracks in the woods
<br>
of a nearby parish.
<br>
<p>On September 13, 2000, laboratory tests of the hair from the Boggy Bayou
<br>
creature revealed that it was not Gigantopithecus blacki (a scientific name
<br>
for sasquatch proposed by Krantz [1992, 193]), but much closer to Booger
<br>
louisiani (my term for the legendary swamp bogeyman). It proved actually to
<br>
be from Equus caballus (a horse), whereupon the local sheriff's department
<br>
promptly ended its investigation (Blanchard 2000; Burdeau 2000).
<br>
<p>Reportedly, Harlan Ford believed the swamp monsters &quot;were probably on the
<br>
verge of extinction&quot; (Holyfield 1999a, 10). Certainly he did much to further
<br>
their cause. It seems likely that--as long as there are suitably remote
<br>
habitats and other essentials (such as campfires around which to tell tales,
<br>
and good ol' boys looking for their fifteen-minutes of fame)--the legendary
<br>
creatures will continue to proliferate.

<p>Note

<p>(1.) Although Harlan Ford obtained tracks of various sizes, a photo of his

mounted casts (Holyfield 1999a, 10) makes it possible to compare them with
<br>
his open hand which touches the display and thus gives an approximate scale.
<br>
This shows all are relatively small. The one I obtained from Holyfield is
<br>
consistent with the larger ones.
