Another forwarded message:
<br>
<em>&gt; The pilot/captain came on the loudspeaker after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doors were closed. His speech went like this: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First I want to thank you for being brave enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fly today. The doors are now closed and we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help from the outside for any problems that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur inside this plane. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...

<p>Like Harvey, I was skeptical about this story.  It is touching but did not
<br>
seem too realistic.  However I saw an article in the paper this morning
<br>
which gives it some credibility.  While they did not find an actual
<br>
pilot who admitted to saying this, they named a passenger who heard it,
<br>
and they quoted another pilot who had also departed from procedure to
<br>
give &quot;stern&quot; advice to his passengers.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting a more sober era of airline travel, some flight crews are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;urging passengers to resist hijackers, and some pilots are even vowing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep knives, flashlights or other weapons handy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the United Airlines captain on a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denver-to-Washington flight Saturday. He reportedly told passengers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that 200 passengers far outnumber any hijacking team, and that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaration of Independence begins with &quot;We, the People.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monologue took passenger Peter Hannaford, a public policy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultant from Washington, by surprise.  &quot;Remember, there will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of him and maybe a few confederates, but there are 200 of you,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hannaford recalled the captain saying.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain urged passengers to stand up immediately and begin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throwing shoes, pillows or anything handy at a would-be hijacker,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then toss a blanket over him and hold him down until the plane lands,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hannaford said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passengers applauded loudly at the announcement, Hannaford
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recalled. &quot;There was a palpable sense of relief,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think there was anyone who didn't clap.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Airlines is investigating the announcement, versions of which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were circulated on the Internet by people identifying themselves as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passengers on United Flight 564 from Denver to Washington's Dulles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airport.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On American Airlines Flight 4 from Los Angeles to New York's Kennedy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Airport, Capt. Kevin Hart adopted a stern tone.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The curtain between first class and business should be considered
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impenetrable for all but uniformed flight crew,&quot; Hart warned passengers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last weekend. &quot;Seat belts will be buckled at all times except when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to use the lavatory. This is mandatory. There will no longer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be any wandering in the aisles.&quot;
<br>
<p>So maybe there is something to it.  Everything is different these days.
<br>
