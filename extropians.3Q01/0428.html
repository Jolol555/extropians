</em><br>
<p>Dooooh!  OK, google is god.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, hows about thinking this over: if a body were to be
<br>
frozen verrrry slowly it would need to hover at 0 degrees for a long
<br>
time, a temperature at which there is still a lot of cell degeneration.
<br>
But what if the corpse is at enormous pressure, reducing the
<br>
temperature at which freezing takes place?  Would that help
<br>
slow the degeneration?  Could we use the old rule of thumb
<br>
of half the reaction rate for each 10 degrees?
<br>
<p>Someone said something about the body may not be able to
<br>
withstand enormous pressures.  Perhaps bones would break, etc.
<br>
Recall that the volume of a bone does not actually decrease when
<br>
broken, so I wouldnt think the bone would care what pressure
<br>
the body was seeing.  Same with the heart.
<br>
<p>If we used the notion of a corpse or perhaps very nearly dead
<br>
person immersed in a gas and slowly frozen, then xenon would
<br>
not be the right stuff, since its critical temperature is way up at
<br>
16 degrees.  We want something neutral like argon, with a low
<br>
critical temperature, so that it remains a gas during the phase
<br>
transition of the body from liquid to solid.
<br>
<p>Question:  is there any reason to think that there would be
<br>
advantages to freezing over a period of up to several days?  Would
<br>
there be any advantage if the freezing could take place at say
<br>
-40 instead of 0?  Could we arrange an artificial heart to keep
<br>
pumping blood slowly and force the lungs to continue breathing
<br>
for a few days after they stopped in order to bring blood gas
<br>
concentrations to some desired value?  spike
