<em>&gt; There are a couple of things I would disagree with; most importantly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assumption that we are going to win this war, that we will subdue
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I simply don't want to believe that we're going to lose to fanaticism
<br>
and what, for want of a non-racist term, I'm going to call Jerry Fallwell
<br>
Values (be they Christian, Moslem, or any other creed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A recent historical example is Khadafi of Libya.  At one time he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly respected in the Arab world, attracting men and money.  The US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed some of his family, nearly killed him, and destroyed much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his equipment.  He lost credibility and hasn't been a threat since.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Er, I'll stick my neck out and assert that the situation with Libya
<br>
is rather more complex than most people realise. Libya actually has
<br>
a smaller population than Israel. And it's unique in being near-as-
<br>
dammit the only attempt since the Spanish Republic to institute a 
<br>
national-scale government based on the creed of Anarcho-Syndicalism.
<br>
<p>As a syndicalist state it's a failure, tending towards the state of
<br>
a typical middle eastern despotism; but I suspect its unpopularity with
<br>
the US State Department had a lot to do with the eeevil bogeyman
<br>
of &quot;anarchism&quot; rearing its head. Certainly, there were and are states
<br>
with a much worse record of sponsoring terrorist groups that didn't
<br>
get a visit by F-111's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Saddam Hussein represents an example of a different sort.  He was left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing after the gulf war and was able to cast that as a victory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sorts.  This has allowed him to retain some strength as a leader,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although the constant battering of American bombs has held him back.
</em><br>
<p>And he's a really evil piece of work. I don't use that word, &quot;evil&quot;,
<br>
lightly. (Suggestion: if you don't believe me, go read Samir Al-Khalil's
<br>
book &quot;Republic of Fear&quot;.)
