</em><br>
<p>In the process of creating many tens of thousands of guerillas
<br>
to repel the Soviets in Afghanistan, many of whom were and are
<br>
Islamic radicals, we set ourselves up for something like the
<br>
Taliban and worse.  They did not just arbitrarily decide we were
<br>
bad guys.  A bunch of highly trained and committed people were
<br>
created and left hanging.  Eventually some of them decided
<br>
Americans and American presence were to be fought.  Not at all
<br>
surprising really.  They cannot &quot;betray us&quot; when they were never
<br>
ours.  We used them and helped them to stop Russia in the
<br>
region.  But that does not mean they were every &quot;ours&quot;.  We are
<br>
no longer considered &quot;guests&quot; where bin Laden is a hero, not a
<br>
guest. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; This is also a responsibility issue. Many, if not most, muslim nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to hold, to a greater or lesser degree, to the idea that attacks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muslim nations by infidels are attacks on all, that allowing infidel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armies into muslim lands, even in defense of a muslim nation, is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affront to Islam (this is the whole basis for bin Laden's arguments that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is so, then it is up to muslim nations to be responsible for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense of muslim nations, AND for the policing of their own. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taliban, and bin Laden, exist because muslim nations around the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow them to exist. If they truly believe that western armies should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay out of muslim nations, they should take care of this problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban, bin Laden and the tens of thousands of trained
<br>
troops and insurgents exist period.  None of the nations could
<br>
take them out and for many of them, it is seen as against their
<br>
own interest to do so as these are troops they can use in some
<br>
cases. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Nor do I think that we will go as far in prosecuting this 'war' as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present jingoism would have us believe. Given past history, I predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Taliban will be quickly defeated in the field and will hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the live or dead bodies of al Qaeda. We will impose some rules on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for the treatment of their people, which they will promptly ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we disembark from that part of the world too soon, because we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to look like we are oppressing other  people too much. We may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get in a few more licks on Saddam, but he will stay around as well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because when it comes down to it, there are too many Americans who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't got the guts to get the job done, and they continue to disguise
</em><br>
<p>Given recent information on this list I think you are dreaming. 
<br>
There is no easy way to find and disarm all of the highly
<br>
trained fanatic soldiers in this region or even a significant
<br>
percentage of them.  The guts needed to fully take care of the
<br>
problem are huge.  I don't think you appreciate how much it
<br>
would take yet.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; it as a dislike of 'killing innocencts', or of 'going too far'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world will look much like it does now when we are done, and Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will lose reelection as well due to dissatisfaction with the result, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism will rise up again to attack us with even greater violence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with nukes, biologicals, or chemical weapons. Our nation will lose all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust of the citizenry, and we will devolve into a fascist camp of ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more limited liberties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is possible no matter what we do in the MidEast now.  If
<br>
many sleepers are in this country and start to be awakened it
<br>
may even be required that very tight security is implemented for
<br>
a time in order to avoid not thousands more but perhaps millions
<br>
being killed.  I don't like that at all and I hope to hell it is
<br>
not necessary.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Is this the sort of future you really want? I don't, but I'm already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing the whining from many who don't want to do what it takes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finish the job and eliminate terrorism once and for all.
</em><br>
<p><p>Are you willing?  It will cost most likely at least a million US
<br>
troops to lose their lives and cost more financially, most
<br>
likely, than Vietnam did to wipe out the threat that
<br>
completely.  Do you want to take that on?
