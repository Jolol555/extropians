Somehow though I would feel better about this if Bush was not backed by a
<br>
Christian extremist and fundamentalist Republican party. Somehow this is
<br>
beginning to remind me of a new crusade in the 21'st century.
<br>
With most of us playing the role of the poor peasant being robbed and killed.
<br>
I think Bush had originally used the word crusade.
<br>
<p>I am sure this connection has occurred to others.

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The latter. To cite a recent case, a superficially reasonable email on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; post-WTC policy sailed into my inbox a few days ago. It made sense right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; unto the final sentence, which read &quot;God bless America&quot;. Now, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; trust people basically driven by inscrutable motivations. One might

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it. Sooner or later, the dissonance must surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; What is the big deal here?  Saying &quot;God bless America&quot; speaks quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to the 90% of Americans according to polls who have some level of theistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; belief.  To ask for God's blessing on America in the face of 9/11 and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; level of belief is almost mandatory if you want to reach the people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to their hearts.  Why should those who are not theistic make such a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; about this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Well, then, what about the remaining 10% - are we chopped liver?  When a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; President speaks to all the &quot;American people,&quot; how does it compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anything he may need to say if he simply talks about the business at hand?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Presidents speak to majorities quite often.  I do understand your point I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just think it is not terribly relevant at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (In fact, he compromises what he has to say every time he mentions God,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because that's coo-coo and childish, e.g., just like having an &quot;Invisible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Friend,&quot; you know, except for grownups.)  Certainly it's the President's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right to mention God, just as it is his right to mention that he believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the earth is flat (althouth even if he and 90% of Americans believed THAT,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it would still not make it true).  But, and this is the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; issue, he would still be excluding 90% of his audience.  Neutrality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; regarding the God issue is a better idea, IMHO - we are supposed to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; secular government, after all.  However, it may be more appropriate for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; President to talk about &quot;God&quot; to a captive audience of churchgoers, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; instance (although it would still be coo-coo).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In these circumstances such neutrality would not speak to what moves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;90% of the people and would fee very strange to them.  We are a secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government.  That does not mean that relgious concepts never get mentioned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I really have what I believe are more pressing things to talk about right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lashing out becauce the G word was used at a time like this is imho
</em><br>
tremendously
<br>
<em>&gt;counterproductive.  As a friend of mine would say &quot;Very true but irrelevant at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this time.&quot;
