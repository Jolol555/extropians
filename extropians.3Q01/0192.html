<em>&gt; More profound than the medical breakthroughs are the detailed arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against these breakthroughs!  The counter-arguments are scare, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest that longevity will give another Hitler a better chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.  They suggest that it would be horrible if money could buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity, or if the rich got healthy before the poor.  There is an entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomsday scenario based on the horrors of longer life.  It is hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine that these views *against* health and longevity even exist.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article fairly presents opposing viewpoints, and the depth and strength of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those viewpoints is profoundly disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>The parallels there again with AIDS circa 1980. Loud and efficient activism
<br>
and advocacy for life extension directed towards the man in the street are
<br>
most definately missing from the current mix; there are a lot of good
<br>
organisations out there, but they're mostly preaching to the choir by this
<br>
stage.
<br>
<p>It is not unreasonable to assume that Western governments could quite
<br>
cheerfully retard antiaging breakthroughs by a couple of decades in response
<br>
to luddite and religious pressure groups. This has happened for technologies
<br>
of reproduction and numerous drugs. If this comes to pass, we will all die
<br>
of old age.
<br>
<p>Ergo, this would seem to be one of the more important items on our
<br>
collective to do list -- to say the least.
