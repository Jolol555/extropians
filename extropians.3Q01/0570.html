Some interesting tidbits from sunday's Washington Post outlook article
<br>
entitled 
<br>
'Calling Dr God'
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Researchers have found, for example, that religious people live, on
<br>
average, about seven years longer than other Americans. Levin cites a
<br>
study done by California's respected Human Population Laboratory that
<br>
tracked 5,000 people for 28 years and found that those who  frequently
<br>
attended church were 23 percent less likely to die during the study
<br>
period than people who didn't regularly go to church. &quot;This holds true
<br>
even controlling for the fact that religious folks tend to avoid such
<br>
behaviors as smoking and drinking that increase the risk of disease and
<br>
death,&quot; Levin reported.
<br>
<p>Other studies have found that for each of the three leading causes of
<br>
death in the United States -- heart disease, cancer and hypertension --
<br>
people who report a religious affiliation have lower rates of illness.
<br>
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have reported that attending
<br>
religious services at least once a month more than halved the risk of
<br>
death due to heart disease, emphysema, suicide and some kinds of
<br>
cancers.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Well, consider this: A 1988 study by San Francisco cardiologist Randolph
<br>
Byrd in the Southern
<br>
Medical Journal reported that coronary care patients who, unknown to
<br>
them, were prayed for by
<br>
strangers in Christian prayer groups outside the hospital fared
<br>
significantly better than patients who did not receive prayers -- a
<br>
finding confirmed by another research team 10 years later and currently
<br>
the subject of a large-scale study at Harvard Medical School. (*)
<br>
<p>More generally, Levin says, a deeply held religious faith seems to be
<br>
particularly effective in warding off death among people who are already
<br>
ill or infirm and wish to return to good health. For example,
<br>
researchers at Dartmouth Medical School examined the survival rates of
<br>
232 post-surgical cardiac patients. &quot;Deaths in a six-month follow-up
<br>
period after open-heart surgery were 11 percent in patients who
<br>
considered themselves 'not at all,' 'slightly' or 'fairly' religious,' &quot;
<br>
Levin reported. &quot;In those who were 'deeply' religious, the death rate
<br>
was zero&quot; -- findings similar to those from a study of 400 older adults
<br>
in Connecticut conducted by researchers at Harvard and Yale
<br>
universities.
<br>

<br>
comment links pro and con).
