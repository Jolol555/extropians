From: &quot;Russell Blackford&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:RussellBlackford@bigpond.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;074601c12e6a$9147d6e0$e15c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">RussellBlackford@bigpond.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think people should be *free* to procreate if that's what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want, ie there should be no laws against it. This is a pretty good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethico-legal principle, at least in first-world nations, and it's part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principle of reproductive liberty. However, there's no basis that I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see for a claim-right, ie that everyone else has to provide you with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to have and raise children.
</em><br>
<p>Extremely well stated. I can see why you were successful in the practice of
<br>
law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, you can look at it, not from a rights point of view, but from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *caring* point of view. Perhaps we should all care for the children in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vicinity, or our polity, when the first-line of parental care fails. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis here is not on the rights of the parents but the needs of children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how we feel about those needs. At that point, there may be a legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role for the state to remove children from parents. But I can see a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons (Zero has alluded to one) why this should be done with enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hesitation and reluctance. Unnecessary state intervention has done untold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm in the past.
</em><br>
<p>That the state should not intervene unnecessarily seems obvious to me (and to
<br>
most others, fortunately). In the case of deadbeat parents who intentionally
<br>
birth children so that they can collect welfare, then the people, the
<br>
community, and the state that represents them definitely need to intervene,
<br>
yes?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
