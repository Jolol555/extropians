<em>&gt;      When Worlds Collide: Quantum Probability From Observer Selection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                          by Robin Hanson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deviations from exact decoherence make little difference for large-amplitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum states, but can make a big difference for small-amplitude states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may provide a rationale for ignoring small-amplitude states when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deriving the Born measurement probabilities from the many worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation.  Interactions between large and small worlds may erase the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory of observers in small amplitude worlds.
</em><br>
<p>A fascinating paper (and great title!).  It raises the tantalizing and
<br>
amazing possibility that we might live in one of the numerous bizarre
<br>
&quot;small&quot; quantum worlds where quantum probabilities fail to hold, but
<br>
due to influences from the rare but &quot;large&quot;, sane worlds, we are unable
<br>
to perceive this.  Plus, conceivably we could construct experiments
<br>
shielded from such influence which would allow us to detect this effect.
<br>
This would allow direct verification of the existence of parallel worlds,
<br>
which is generally considered impossible based on the assumption that
<br>
we live in a &quot;large&quot; world.
<br>
<p>Exciting as this is, I think the more likely possibility is the suggestion
<br>
that the small worlds would be effectively eliminated by this influence,
<br>
with the existence of observers impossible as the laws of physics
<br>
essentially go crazy.
<br>
<p>The details of the physics were somewhat over my head as I have never
<br>
studied density matrices, but I have several questions.
<br>
<p>The paper describes a simple case with one large and one small world.
<br>
Does the math still work if there are enormously more small worlds than
<br>
large ones, as I believe is expected to be the case?  Is it necessary
<br>
to consider the ratio of numbers of small to large worlds?
<br>
<p>What about intermediate worlds?  It seems that we have &quot;large&quot; worlds
<br>
where quantum probabilities hold, and &quot;small&quot; worlds where we have
<br>
drastic departure from quantum probabilities so that the amplitude of
<br>
such worlds is miniscule.  Presumably there are &quot;medium&quot; worlds where the
<br>
probabilities are somewhat different from what they should be, worlds of
<br>
low probability (say, one in a billion) but still much higher than the
<br>
probabilities relating to environmental coherence effects from neighboring
<br>
worlds (which are presumably of astronomically low probability).  Can we
<br>
understand why we are not in such a &quot;medium&quot; world?  (Or perhaps we are,
<br>
the law of probability only being true on average?)
<br>
<p>Everett's original paper used a continuous rather than discrete
<br>
representation of the wave function.  Rather than summations over a
<br>
finite set of state vectors, he used an integration over an infinite set.
<br>
Does the math still work in the case of an infinite dimensional set?
<br>
<p>In the case of infinite dimensions, the paradox which the paper attempts
<br>
to address does not really exist IMO.  The point is that with a continuum
<br>
you can no longer count worlds because there are an infinite number in
<br>
all subsets.  You can't say a priori that there are more bizarre worlds
<br>
than normal ones.  Rather, in order to evaluate the relative contribution
<br>
of any subsets of worlds you need to define a probability density function
<br>
which you then multiply by whatever you are measuring in the worlds,
<br>
and integrate.
<br>
<p>The paradox only arises if you assume the uniform density function
<br>
(and I'm not even sure whether that can be uniquely defined, depending
<br>
on decomposition).  But this is an arbitrary choice.  If you choose
<br>
a density function based on Born measure, then of course you get the
<br>
desired answer that small worlds make a small contribution.  Given the
<br>
implicit requirement to choose a density function, there is no more
<br>
reason to suppose that the uniform density is the &quot;right&quot; answer than
<br>
the Born density.  Hence there is no reason to expect that small worlds
<br>
would have more contributions than large ones.
<br>
<p>In this context, Robin's paper implicity assumes a uniform density and
<br>
shows that you still get the right answer in that case.  However that
<br>
choice is ultimately just as arbitrary as any other.  It might still be
<br>
possible to come up with a density function where you get the wrong answer
<br>
(say, by over-weighting the &quot;medium&quot; worlds above).
<br>
<p>In effect Robin's paper says that if all worlds make an equal contribution
<br>
then you can still get the Born probabilities (modulo the various caveats
<br>
and assumptions).  This is a step forward as it is a simpler assumption
<br>
than others which have been made.  But I am not very comfortable with
<br>
this assumption (that all worlds should be counted equally).
<br>
<p>Another reason for my discomfort (besides its lack of naturalness when
<br>
this assumption is extrapolated to the continuous case) is that the same
<br>
issue arises in wider &quot;all-universe&quot; theories.  In these models, by people
<br>
like Tegmark and Schmidhuber, we go beyond QM to assume that any universe
<br>
which could be represented by a mathematical structure or computer program
<br>
actually exists.  But again, such models have bizarre worlds as well as
<br>
simple ones, and by simple counting arguments the bizarre worlds should be
<br>
far more numerous.  Why do we see a simple universe?  We need to invoke
<br>
a weighting function or measure which controls how much &quot;contribution to
<br>
reality&quot; a world makes.  And luckily such a measure exists very naturally,
<br>
the so-called universal measure which is simply the information content
<br>
of the program or theory which creates/describes the universe.  Simpler
<br>
theories produce exponentially more probable universes.
<br>
<p>Given this philosophical precedent I am very comfortable with invoking the
<br>
existence of a weighting function for the universes in QM many-worlds.
<br>
However it is true that the particular weighting function which is used
<br>
does not seem completely natural.  I would like to see a justification
<br>
for it in terms of simplicity.  If the worlds where QM laws hold sensibly
<br>
and logically could be described more simply than those where bizarre
<br>
things happen, that would IMO be a good philosophical justification for
<br>
why they were more likely to be experienced.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, if an explanation like Robin's can work, it does seem to cut
<br>
the knot and eliminate much of the difficulty.  If stable observers can
<br>
exist only in universes which match the predictions of QM, or if observers
<br>
in bizarre universes somehow nevertheless experience only sane events,
<br>
then there seems to be nothing left to explain and the issue is solved.
