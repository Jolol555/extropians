<p>It's pretty gross, yes.
<br>
<p>I've been doing some digging on the DMCA of late -- wearing one hat,
<br>
I get to write articles about civil liberties and the net in Computer
<br>
Shopper (UK mag of that name, not the US version -- it's the biggest-
<br>
selling monthly computer mag over here), and I'm currently doing a
<br>
detailed backgrounder on the Sklyarov case. We're seeing a world-wide
<br>
move to clamp down on copying technology; this isn't just going on in
<br>
the USA.  Basically, the music and film industries have collectively shat
<br>
themselves over the implications of the internet, and rather than trying
<br>
to come up with a workable business model they're trying to destroy the
<br>
perceived competition.
<br>
<p>If it goes through, expect the US State Department to try to export
<br>
it. The real place to lobby isn't congress or senate, though -- it's
<br>
the World Trade Organisation, WIPO, and the other treaty organisations
<br>
that build the international free trade infrastructure. The big music
<br>
and film corporations know enough to lobby them, and in the absence of
<br>
consumer lobbying to the contrary, they're getting their way.
<br>
<p>Frightening read: &quot;Outlaw School&quot; by Rebecca Ore. (Probably deserved the
<br>
Prometheus award far more than a second-rate L. Neil Smith novel; it's
<br>
the scariest dystopian near-future I've read in ages. In fact, it's
<br>
probably not going too far to compare it to &quot;1984&quot; in its impact for 
<br>
the net generation. It's a sign of how far down that road we've already
<br>
gone that it hasn't gathered the attention it deserves ...)
