Of the notes I have read on this issue, I think people here are really
<br>
missing the point.
<br>
People who have strong beliefs in religion live longer because they have
<br>
established a
<br>
sense of emotional fulfillment in terms of their place in existence, a value
<br>
system, and a community. Religious belief is only one expression of this
<br>
phenomena.
<br>
<p>Three other examples approached from different angles support this
<br>
contention.
<br>
First, women's life expectancy in developed western nations is longer
<br>
than men's. That is because women are more capable of developing deeper,
<br>
more satisfying emotional relationships. This gives them greater longevity
<br>
whether they have been married or always single. Of the group, the never
<br>
been married
<br>
single man has the lowest life expectancy. This fact has also been
<br>
demonstrated
<br>
in many survival situations. One example
<br>
being the Donner party, being trapped by winter snows in the Sierra Nevada,
<br>
the unattached single men were the first to die. Lastly, in the
<br>
Nazi concentration camps those who were best able to psychologically survive
<br>
the
<br>
experience were those who held a strong belief system giving them the tools
<br>
to
<br>
deal with the situation. This included, Catholics, Jews, communists, etc.

<em>&gt; &gt; This resembles the old cause-and-effect-reversal that &quot;married people
</em><br>
live
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; longer&quot; used as an argument for getting married. Actually, people who
</em><br>
live
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; longer (because they're healthy and able-bodied) are more likely to
</em><br>
marry.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitely!  Whenever I see a statistical study, I always try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause-and-effect reversal and independent causal analysis to see if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make more sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the assertion is that church-goers live longer, I ask if people who
</em><br>
live
<br>
<em>&gt; longer (i.e., are old) go to church more.  This seems a more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, it could be an independent cause.  Maybe the same belief system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes church-going also causes a safer environment:  No drinking, no sex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no driving fast, no staying up late, no partying, no gluttony, etc.  Or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be that the extreme conservativism of the church to do everything the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old way and never try anything new helps protect people from exposure to
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; new risks throughout their lives.  Independent cause analysis usually is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better explanation than the cause-and-effect reversal.
