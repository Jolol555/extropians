<p>I ask for a surgical retaliation but not a &quot;moderate&quot; one. 
<br>
Moderation with these murderers has got us to this place.  It
<br>
does not work.  We will not strike blindly but I hope we strike
<br>
with all force necessary to take out each and every one of the
<br>
main terrorist groups that attack us.  If it also requires
<br>
taking out a government that uses terrorism as a weapon of a war
<br>
it dares not declare then so be it.  We have been visciously
<br>
attacked.  This is war.  Those who have declared themselves our
<br>
enemies by their actions will be defeated.  
<br>
<p>I will write asking that we stop pretending we can negotiate our
<br>
way out of this or that those groups and nations sworn to our
<br>
destruction don't mean precisely that or that it is reasonable
<br>
for us to take them at less than their word.  They, at least
<br>
some of them, have shown they are a very clear and present
<br>
danger.  They must be treated accordingly.
