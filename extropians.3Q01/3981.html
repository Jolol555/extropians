</em><br>
<p>I'm a woman, and I've never encountered PMS ... or have ever gotten morning
<br>
sickness during any of my three pregnancies.  I'm not saying these things
<br>
don't exist - but many women don't have many of these symptoms attributable
<br>
to their &quot;womanliness,&quot; and that includes the &quot;hot flashes&quot; in later life.
<br>
Women with these symptoms are higher in noise level and profile (&quot;news&quot;)
<br>
than those women whose symptoms are negligible to nil (&quot;no news&quot;), so
<br>
somehow the &quot;news&quot; gets painted onto &quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot; women?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and being viewed as a sex object (the latter
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seems like fun to me!)

<em>&gt; Being admired and even desired can be fun, depending on who is

</em><br>
<p>I've never understood the &quot;meat market&quot; analogy.  Attractive women have
<br>
tremendous power, and if a woman has beauty + brains = the power is almost
<br>
incalculable.  This seems like the flip side of the &quot;discriminated white
<br>
male syndrome.&quot;  An attractive woman with high intelligence who cries
<br>
&quot;Victim, victim ...&quot; somehow ... (but this is not to say there aren't real
<br>
&quot;victims&quot; of violence, tragedy, bad physical or mental health - irrespective
<br>
of demographics).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One feels invisible as an actual person and seen only as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object of sexual desire.  There is a big difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a &quot;sex object&quot; and being seen as a person who is among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things sensual and sexual.
</em><br>
<p>Funny, some older women and men say there comes a day when they feel
<br>
&quot;invisible&quot; because they are NO LONGER seen as an object of sexual desire.
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, it seems to me there is NO tremendous difference between
<br>
being a &quot;sex object&quot; or a &quot;hand object&quot; (in the latter case, e.g., of a
<br>
model whose hands are used in a nail polish advertisement).  Our appendages
<br>
and our sexuality are a part of whole package.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, from this end of the gender spectrum, there is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of being sexual prey, of being a target and possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victim of sexual predation.  It feels quite different on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side in that respect.  I don't think a lot of (more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gender average) guys would enjoy that aspect very much.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a pretty deep vulnerability in being female that we respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to in our different ways.
</em><br>
<p>Women and men have many of the same vulnerabilities (death and taxes, ha
<br>
ha), as well as other vulnerabilities more typical for men (dangerous
<br>
occupational hazards, playing the role of &quot;protector-hero&quot;) than for women,
<br>
and vice versa.   In my opinion, many men are &quot;victims&quot; of &quot;sexual
<br>
predation&quot; in a somewhat different way than what is considered &quot;sexual
<br>
predation&quot; towards women.  From my observations (all subjective, personal,
<br>
anectodal - acknowledged) women still &quot;use&quot; men to get what women want -
<br>
i.e., being taken care of, having children, having the children being taken
<br>
care of.  Many women still tend to &quot;sell&quot; themselves to the highest bidder.
<br>
Things are getting better, though (but slower than I would have thought a
<br>
generation ago when I was young).
<br>
<p>If I neglected to qualify &quot;some&quot; or &quot;many&quot; in talking about &quot;men&quot; and
<br>
&quot;women&quot; above - I never meant to imply &quot;all&quot; ... in any case.
