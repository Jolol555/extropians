<em>&gt; &gt; Lee wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, I know that the temptation to sarcasm is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; strong---especially when one feels outnumbered.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I was just projecting.  This list has a history of being dominated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by libertarians, and sometimes I've noticed people resorting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcasm not out of a justifiable cleverness, nor to be funny, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consisely answer a lot of challenges.  Their emotions also show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot predict how my occasional use of sarcasm will play (clever? funny?
<br>
chickenshit?), and I cannot promise my emotions won't show through (although
<br>
I'm not overly sentimental).  I can't even say I won't be stumped for
<br>
answers, sometimes, but part of the reason I joined this list is to learn
<br>
things.  For a freedom-loving libertarian (I'm assuming you are one), you
<br>
surely have a lot of rules and expectations ... sheesh!
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt;&gt; In a society of millions, or hundreds of millions, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; people's economic worth to others will be vastly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; than other's economic worth.  Should school teachers be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; paid more than movie stars?  Who is to say?  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; is not [to let] some committee force their decision on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; others, but [to let] people freely choose with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; dollar-votes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But which committee decides the worth of those dollar-votes?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Ahem, I'm not getting the idea across.  Choosing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'dollar-votes' is libertarian-speak for free choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made through purchasing power.
</em><br>
<p>But before people go shopping with their wads of money grasped firmly in
<br>
their fists, somebody, somewhere decides CEOs' salaries.  Somebody,
<br>
somewhere decides that sanitation workers (who perform an important function
<br>
for our society) receive a lot less money than physicians (who also perform
<br>
an important function for our society).  It's more like, somebody-somewhere
<br>
decides, and then the people march to their tune (through purchasing power).
<br>
Whether &quot;somebody-somewhere&quot; is a committee, a board of directors, or a
<br>
corporation ... what's to prevent &quot;self-service above all&quot; from occurring?
<br>
(I sent along another post regarding this, about the tech layoffs in the
<br>
Seattle area, which play into this subject.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, sometimes the differences are obscene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So are you saying, &quot;so what?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I'm saying that just because Spielberg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes fifty million dollars a year, and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teacher makes twenty thousand, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for some committee to decide how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr. Spielberg &quot;is really entitled to&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to transfer (by force, not persuasion) some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portion of his income to teachers.
</em><br>
<p>But don't the teachers transfer some of their income to Spielberg, as well?
<br>
(I'm talking about taxes, not movie tickets.)  Doesn't Spielberg get more
<br>
than enough to live on, in any case (whether he pays taxes or not)?
<br>
Spielberg - being rich, though - isn't just making whatever salary he gets
<br>
for moviemaking.  He's probably living for free, as he probably has owned
<br>
houses through the years, which have appreciated.
<br>
<p>I'm not exactly rich, but I can tell you I've been living for free since
<br>
1981, since the first time I owned a house.  What a surprise it was the
<br>
first time I sold that house - not only did I get all the money back from
<br>
interest, principal, and all the money I ever put into construction costs,
<br>
realtor's fees and the rest - but I actually made more money.  And I've been
<br>
living from free since then.  My job pays for food, clothes and such, as
<br>
well as my present mortgage - but when I move, I'll probably get all that
<br>
mortgage money back, and then some, again (this has been a 100% sure thing
<br>
for 20 years, but I'm only extrapolating, not really knowing what the future
<br>
will bring).  Granted, since 1981 I've lived in California and now
<br>
Washington, where property values have kept going up more than in some other
<br>
states, but it seems the &quot;haves&quot; (and I consider myself one, now that I've
<br>
been able to live for free for 2 decades) have nothing to complain about.  I
<br>
know, I know, not everyone believes as I do, but that's my take on this
<br>
issue.  And I appreciate the many people - even poor people - who have paid
<br>
their taxes so that I've been able to live for free for so long (what with
<br>
tax write-offs and property values soaring).  I figure, the least I can do
<br>
is not begrudge those poorer (&quot;have-nots&quot;) people who have not jumped on the
<br>
gravy train of home ownership.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm only glad the libertarians weren't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;charge&quot; during the Civil Rights Movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The differences, obscene as they are now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have been even more so.  Where would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we be now - still living in a segregated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is that offensive racist behavior would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly faded by now---it was already on its way out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when government decided to use force.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what part of the country you are living, but racist behavior
<br>
has not faded in Seattle, Washington.  And we are considered to be
<br>
&quot;tolerant,&quot; as cities go ...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, starting
<br>
<em>&gt; with the most educated people, pre-judging someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based only on their race would seem stupid in the south,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as it had already started to seem stupid in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; north.  My opinion is that most whites would in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case still view blacks as underdogs, and thus be willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be pretty sympathetic, just as underdogs always a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite.  But for this change to happen naturally would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take several generations, and revolutionaries are never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content with that.
</em><br>
<p>I see no reason to eat my ACLU membership card just yet, then (this refers
<br>
to another post where I challenged any libertarian to come up with a good
<br>
solution to the problem we've had with &quot;race&quot; in our country, especially the
<br>
South and segregation).  I appreciate that you took the time to answer from
<br>
your perspective, Lee (and I always appreciate people taking time from their
<br>
busy and not-yet-infinite precious lives), but I think you're being overly
<br>
optimistic as far as people becoming more tolerant on their own.  Even as de
<br>
jure segregation went down in flames (literally, at times), I see de facto
<br>
segregation everywhere (schools, work, social functions, you name it).  I've
<br>
been seeing it, I've talked to people who have been affected by it
<br>
(recently), and it comes in all forms, from subtle to out-there outright.
<br>
It's cruel and it's unfair.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But we'd be without the arrogance of whites &quot;granting&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them rights, favoring them because they had to (by law),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it impossible for a black to tell whether he got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an important job on his own merits, or whether it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely the result of affirmative action, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>WARNING -  sarcasm straight ahead:  Do you mean to imply George W. Bush is
<br>
not an Affirmative Action Baby?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thomas Sowell documents in excruciating detail the horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results of affirmative action:  black students that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been very competant at a typical UC school (where I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went) got drafted into the very best classes at MIT and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cal Tech, and got creamed.  Then the second tier of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black students was placed, over their heads, in schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as mine, and got humiliated again (even though they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied very hard).  And finally, this evil process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denuded the lower colleges of the worthy black students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who should have been attending (but were shuffled into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher ones), in order to guarantee failure at all levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such things happen when we follow government edicts instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evolutionary processes.
</em><br>
<p>You got Thomas Sowell.  I got Randall Robinson.  I don't mean to be flip,
<br>
but, I have read Sowell and I have read Robinson, and Robinson's my man.
<br>
And Robinson's is more than that - he's a heroic man, who has acted
<br>
honorably to help bring about the end of apartheid in South Africa.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Switching to the utterly mundane, thanks for correcting my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;obcene&quot; typo, Lee ... I hate it when I do that.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You're very welcome.  If I want my posts to be read, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want them readable.
</em><br>
<p>For a non-native speaker, I get by!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the government didn't end up taking half (!) my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, I would indeed be vastly more charitable.  Now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we think of it as &quot;the government's&quot; responsibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it was a big mistake for it to have ever come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Lee, but do you own your house?  Then maybe you live free, as I do, and
<br>
looking at it this way, that &quot;half&quot; of your salary isn't really all gone ...
<br>
just in a holding pattern.  Don't think &quot;half&quot; - think &quot;have.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Olga
