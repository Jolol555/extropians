<em>&gt; Hmmm... nope. Maybe it is marketed under a different brand name in Oz.
</em><br>
<p>Does any of Antra, Gastroloc, Mopral, Omepral or Prilosec sound familiar?
<br>
The generic name is Omeprazole.
<br>
<p>(Maybe one reason you have not heard about it is that you are not a swede -
<br>
since Astra was swedish, the ups and downs of Losec were mentioned quite
<br>
heavily in the media)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Exactly why was that a huge commercial success for Astra, if they could

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Now the market for ulcer treatments is much smaller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know of any ulcer cures marketed here in Oz. It has been known for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe a decade, maybe two, that the pylori(sp?) bacteria are the cause of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; palliatives are advertised heavily on TV and in the print media.
</em><br>
<p>Odd. Here in Europe ulcers are commonly treated with Losec to get the acid
<br>
concentration down, combined with an antibiotic to get rid of the
<br>
Heliobacter. OK, it won't cure *all* ulcers, but it has moved most gastric
<br>
ulcers into the minor problem category. BTW, diet and lifestyle seems to be
<br>
less relevant to the illness than previously believed. 
<br>
<p>In any case, Losec was Astra's best seller for many years, making the
<br>
company a tidy profit. Of course, now the patent has ended and proton pump
<br>
inhibitor drugs are becoming generic. It still means that ulcers will
<br>
likely never become a serious problem again. A nice example of how
<br>
capitalism can solve some problems. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You are likely thinking of why so little is spent on malaria vaccines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cures for other tropical diseases. That is a real problem, but the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;isn't that cures are unprofitable (they aren't) but that it is hard to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any profit commensurable with the investment in the current regulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;climate. The base costs of pharmaceutical development are high, and if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to get FDA approval or something like it they will be even greater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That will make the potential market in the developing countries small, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;given the latest anti-patent moves on pharmaceuticals you might end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;funding competitors instead. If you just sell something less well tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cheaply or do the tests in the developing nations you will be crucified in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the media as a ruthless profiteer exploiting the poor. It is a lose-lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;situation which any sensible corporation will try to stay out from, leaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it to far less well funded organisations. Too bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. This is part of my point. Capitalism fails here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not really the fault of regulations either. The regulations are there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a very good reason: to try to eliminate unethical business practices 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and honest mistakes (think thalidomide). And those costs would come about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one way or another eventually, perhaps by total distrust of all medical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies and associated loss of sales, or by insurance costs after mopping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up disasters, or by general damage to the drug-buying public.
</em><br>
<p>I think others have given more detailled answers to these arguments. On a
<br>
more general level I think it is more important to think in terms of
<br>
how well different systems work in different situations, and which can be
<br>
implemented ethically. Saying that capitalism is not an universal solution
<br>
to every problem is a truism; it is more interesting to look at questions
<br>
about what alternatives exist and when they might be applicable, and
<br>
whether one can propose systems of allocation that are better. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What it comes down to is that the phamaceutical companies are motivated by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money. That is neither a good nor a bad thing. But it does mean that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity can't depend upon capitalism alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where non-profit organisations shine. They help humanity where the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money won't lure capitalism.
</em><br>
<p>You can get capitalism to solve your problems if you find a way of
<br>
converting your wish into money. If people show that they are willing to
<br>
pay for a solution, then a market exist. It might require some lateral
<br>
thinking of finding a way of making money from selling drugs to the very
<br>
poor, but I think it can be done. As a first approximation, what about
<br>
something similar to that publishing scheme where for every book sold a
<br>
copy goes to the third world? If for every second (or tenth) aspirin sold
<br>
in the west an antimalaria pill was given to (say) WHO. &quot;Ethical drugs&quot;
<br>
might be a great marketing trick (which incidentally might force a
<br>
reconsideration of the heavy bottom-line thinking in publicly funded health
<br>
care). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel the need to repeat that I am not against capitalism -- I think it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very cool. I just don't think it is the answer to everything. And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism as religion scares the willies out of me, just as all religions do.
</em><br>
<p>Well, money is a measure of value, and isn't value exactly what all
<br>
religions strive to achieve? :-)
