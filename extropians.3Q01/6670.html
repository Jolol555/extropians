</em><br>
<p>But Israel has no oil.  Does the US alliance with Israel help
<br>
maintain access to Middle Eastern countries that do have oil?  If
<br>
oil is the objective, it'd be simpler to pay off/befriend Saudi
<br>
Arabia and Kuwait than to ally with Israel.
<br>
<p>Of course the US already does that.  Protecting Israel and protecting
<br>
access to oil are somewhat separable, and both dispensable --
<br>
<p>Israel is able to defend itself quite nicely.
<br>
<p>Why would all of the Persian Gulf region countries stop selling
<br>
oil unless we really, really pissed them off?  They _need_ to sell
<br>
us oil.  They haven't got anything else.  We can avoid pissing them
<br>
off by leaving well enough alone.
<br>
<p>During the cold war, protecting access to oil arguably merited
<br>
active defense, as the Soviet Union would have loved to deny us
<br>
access to oil, regardless of the economic consequences for producing
<br>
regions.  Although, unless we were actually at war, I bet the USSR
<br>
would've sold us oil if they controlled the Middle East -- we've got
<br>
all the other goods they want -- though they would've milked our
<br>
dependence for every political drop they could get.
