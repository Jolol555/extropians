</em><br>
<p>Generally I am not serious on this, to the extent protrayed, but, as you
<br>
noted the exception of Kent State, military folks generally have the
<br>
sentiment that left wingers think that you have to be a psychopathic
<br>
baby killing murderer to want to serve your country in the military, and
<br>
the fact that lefties are far more enthusiastic about identifying first
<br>
with any group OTHER than Americans, whether it be elitist Franco-philic
<br>
or Euro-philic quiche eating, or the more prevalent movements of
<br>
'hyphenated americans', and are so ready to schuck their duty as
<br>
citizens and dodge the draft, etc.
<br>
<p>By the eyes of many military people, since lefties generally don't
<br>
consider themselves to be Americans first, they are expressly asking to
<br>
be treated in a second class manner. More so, many consider the left
<br>
wing demagogery of activists and a good chunk of the legal profession in
<br>
general to be traitors to the Constitution, tearing it down while hiding
<br>
behind it.
<br>
<p>It is good to see, though, in this instance that so many of those on the
<br>
left are finally realizing what a bankrupt philosophy the concept of
<br>
moral equivalence is. Not all are though. Listening to a call-in program
<br>
on public radio yesterday, I was disgusted by the namby pamby BS coming
<br>
from it seems every bleeding heart in the Twin State region calling in
<br>
and yakking about  'not jumping to conclusions', of 'stepping back to
<br>
take a breath', and realizing how 'oppressed' these terrorists have
<br>
been. Osama bin Laden has never been 'oppressed', how 'violence isn't
<br>
the answer'..... He's worth nearly a billion dollars, and his family
<br>
continues to funnel money to him, and he and his followers certainly DO
<br>
understand the value of violence to the exclusion of most everything
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>I have often written here about how rebels, revolutionaries, and
<br>
terrorists are not born, they are made. They do not act irrationally,
<br>
they use violence in entirely rational ways that is consistent with the
<br>
politics and security of their movement. They do have value systems
<br>
entirely different from ours which permits them to act in ways
<br>
consistent with their cultural paradigm. 
<br>
<p>This does not mean that they are right, that they have a right to their
<br>
opinion, or that they or their movements should be permitted to exist.
<br>
There is no such thing as moral equivalence. This is a concept of the
<br>
moral coward, who uses it to avoid making the difficult commitments
<br>
required as a responsibility of citizenship in decent society. It is at
<br>
best a lazy attitude, and at worst a bankrupt and traitorous one.
<br>
<p>The fact is that those on the left tend, to a far greater degree, nearly
<br>
exclusively, to be moral cowards of this sort, and is why those of us
<br>
who have served, and those who continue to serve, in defense of decent
<br>
society, do not trust those on the left as full citizens: they refuse to
<br>
act like full citizens.
<br>
<p>I can only hope that this episode in history serves as an educational
<br>
one: there is objective right and wrong in the universe, and there comes
<br>
a time where vaccillation on this is no longer acceptable to
<br>
intelligent, sentient individual beings.
