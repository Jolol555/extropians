<em>&gt; Actually the majority of scientist acknowlege that there is global warming.
</em><br>
<p>Yes there is, but not about its cause. There is not a consensus that it
<br>
is CO2 caused. Many think that CO2 increases are simply an effect (which
<br>
would jive with the fact that studies of increases in coal burning (i.e
<br>
CO2 production) FOLLOWED increases in average temperatures. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a majority that acknowledge some part of that warming is human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based.
</em><br>
<p>There is good evidence that at least 1/10th to possibly as much as 1/6th
<br>
of the CO2 content is human produced. There is no evidence to account
<br>
for changes in nature's ability to absorb CO2. If warming caused by
<br>
solar action reduces natures ability to absorb CO2, then no amount of
<br>
measures by humans can prevent CO2 from rising. Moreover, the curve of
<br>
CO2's ability to function as a greenhouse gas is one of diminishing
<br>
returns as content rises. Right now, we are at an almost flat point in
<br>
the curve: more pollution will do little to increase warming, while the
<br>
sky-is-falling types are treating it like it is a linear relationship.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is good evidence that some of it is solar bases.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, even the greens acknowledge that at least 1/3 of the warming is
<br>
solar caused. There is no consensus about whether the solar caused
<br>
component has influenced obsorption rates, etc, which would drastically
<br>
alter this estimate. Some think that direct and indirect solar action
<br>
has caused at least 3/4 of it, part of which is a matter of our use of
<br>
CFC's in aerosols: solar UV levels rising kills more plankton that would
<br>
normally be absorbing CO2, thus CO2 absorption is reduced. This can be,
<br>
and has been, directly measured in krill populations in the southern
<br>
ocean. The greens refuse to acknowledge this mechanism as 'solar
<br>
caused'. While our CFC use is also directly implicated in this
<br>
phenomenon, our complicity is over and CFC content is waning, while the
<br>
greens continue to count this impact with CO2 production...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit of evidence that geophysical phenomena are partially to blaim. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be in a temporary phase caused by several unrelated forces that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment are in constructive interference, and that may change anytime.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the three Malenkovich cycles, for instance, correctly predict the
<br>
current warming trend...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The media is famous for making the public stupid crazy (eg. Oat Bran)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and blowing little deals into big deals by the liberal application of bovine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feces wherever it may cause the increased growth of ratings. That said, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now at a time in our existence that we can actually impact the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and have. We've polluted entire oceans, and done some really stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things because they seemed like a good idea at the time. I refer to this as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Jethro Factor (or a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.)
</em><br>
<p>What's this? Exhibiting anti-redneck prejudice? ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wise beyond normal human limits to act with caution, and proceed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all due prudence in the areas of human indeavor that might have negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact until we have adequate means to understand the likely results of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our actions. I figure that we'll have computers up to snuff in about 5 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Machines able to model in terms of tens of petaflops. We should declare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 5 year project of cleaning up our messes and not making any new ones,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we can see exactly what part we play in this dance. Then when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; final ballots come in we can begin looking at what the real playing field looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.
</em><br>
<p>However, the as the models get more sophisticated, they continuously 
<br>
are downgrading the severity of the projected temperature change. At
<br>
present, it is already far below the level that would have enough impact
<br>
on the poles to melt the above sea level ice sheets. This means the
<br>
'flood' warnings are boving excrement, to say the least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and there is much less consensus about the net effects of the warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; because some will be good and some will be bad.  Stossel emphasized the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; second point and let it be assumed that the disagreement covered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; other issue as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure. If it is actually occuring, and its not actually a bad thing (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can complain about millions of square miles of tundra becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productive agricultural acrage? Who can complain about the fact that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sea levels rise, this will actually INCREASE the amount of coastline,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and therefore more seashore fore everybody....)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless we find out that tundra is a crucial part of the complex human ecology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are biota... that's it on that. You have abslutely no clue, what are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential life forms on this planet for the continued existence of Homo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sapiens. Ecological systems are so complex, and you don't know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tundra may impact carribu, that impact bears, that impact seals, that impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orca, that impact krill, that impact grey whales, that impact through ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other degrees of freedom human e. coli that impact you and me. Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science is nowhere adavnced enough to figure out the critical interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and relationships between organic populations on this planet, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think melting the perma frost sound like an invitation to surfing...
</em><br>
<p>What I do know is that every degree of removal from direct impact always
<br>
results in reduced impact.
<br>
<p>The fact is that the caribou populations have soared and crashed back
<br>
and forth in the past. There are now many times more than there were a
<br>
century ago. Polar bears may not be able to go out to sea as much to
<br>
hunt seals, they will be limited to caribou and those seals that come up
<br>
on the beach. None of this impacts humans in any way, Anne. We've seen
<br>
far more severe environmental changes in the historic and pre-historic
<br>
past than are currently projected, without any significant impact on
<br>
humans. The sky is not falling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do a whole lot more taking care of the house while we're still living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it... if you catch my drift. Every single experiment ever done with living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populations say diversity good, monoculture bad. 
</em><br>
<p>We dont' live in a monoculture. What experiments do say that ecosystems
<br>
can do just fine with a limited number of species. Any more than a dozen
<br>
and you are back on top of that diminishing returns curve again. Mild
<br>
diversity is just about as good as broad diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a cornerstone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaotic self critical systems. You don't go screwing around with critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecologies without serious kaka falling out someplace you never even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected. We don't even have the brights yet to make plans on the scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are suggesting, and we sure as hell shouldn't be making these kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impacts on the world in the one in a billion shot that it might prove to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good thing! There's a reason why nobody is agreeing!!! IT'S JUST TOO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COMPLICATED!!! Notice &quot;Too Complicated&quot; is not an invitation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screw with. How many of you who have not had comercial jet training,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would feel comfortable taking a 747 up for a spin?!!! Then why in god's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name are you even talking about taking the planet for one?!!!
</em><br>
<p>Actually, several of us have flown 747 simulators a number of times.
<br>
I've got mine configured with x-plane, I've even got several different
<br>
747 models to choose from (and skin designs). Flying a plane is not that
<br>
tough. Most of the 'training' in a formal setting is training one to
<br>
deal with wacko situations without freaking out. Those situations aside,
<br>
driving a 747 is like driving a bus.
<br>
<p>What is important is situation awareness. Most of the people freaking
<br>
out about 'global warming' are NOT any sort of scientists, and those
<br>
that are are doing so because they find that this is a means to an end:
<br>
the institution of their socialist agenda. Its like I'm flying the
<br>
plane, but the passengers are freaking out that we're gonna crash
<br>
because one guy is claiming to be a pilot and says we are gonna crash,
<br>
when in actuality he's just a terrorist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poor stewardship of the planet (and in this case I'm talking of only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that thin layer filled with life that begins in priority with homo sapiens)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by both econazis and blind business fanatics, is a threat to our long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term survival and advancement. We must be better at making sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world is able to sustain us as we become what we dream of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming. Things are not doing wonderfully at the moment, one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first things we can begin, as growing sentients, is preserve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viability of our place of birth... at least until we are born!
</em><br>
<p>That's one way of looking at it, and properly balanced. 
<br>
<p>Then there is the 'fast rise' contingent: we, like any fetus, have no
<br>
use for its placenta once it's born. If Earth is as inconsequential in
<br>
the universe as many claim, there are boundless other ones out there.
<br>
Boundless resources are not worth using with a conservation mindset.
