<em>&gt; Most Americans (and I apologise in advance to the enlightened members of this list) seem to have a fixation on their country.  This fixations leaves many Americans to accept the history that the USA puts out without considering facts and falsehoods.  Th

e rest of the world seems to have a rather different opinion of America and to be rather blunt, there isn't a hope of any nation joining the USA in any but the most extreme of conditions.
<br>
<p>Oh, I don't know. Several years ago, during the height of the Quebecois
<br>
secession referenda, there was a significant movement in British
<br>
Columbia to join the US in response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Most of Europe considers America with a sort of amused fear.  The gung ho policies of the US government and selective democracy (NSA anyone), coupled with the fierce national pride that America tends to exhibit gives the impression of a six year old c
</em><br>
hild with a bazooka, unpredictable and dangerous.  America is certainly the most powerful nation in the world and many countries are, or seek to be allied to the states by none would join.
<br>
<p>Well, considering that no european nation recognizes the inherent rights
<br>
of its citizens to the degree that our government does our rights, I
<br>
don't see 'selective democracy' claims as having any weight, especially
<br>
considering we are not a democracy, we are a republic. The NSA spies on
<br>
YOU, not us.
<br>
<p>Moreover, the claim of us acting like a 'child with a bazooka,
<br>
unpredictable and dangerous' is also laughable, unless you are a
<br>
congenital hoplophobe. The US has not initiated any conflicts at all,
<br>
does not wage open war on its own people, does not commit widespread
<br>
genocide with the flip of a hat, and does not confiscate the rights of
<br>
the accused in the heat of nationalistic hysteria. European countries
<br>
make a career of doing just these things. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many People world wide are fooled by the brain washing that occurs through the media and especially hollywood.  To someone who has only done high school history, the American troops probably did win the D-day landing, and the Americans probably did do O
</em><br>
K at Pearl harbour. Movies such as Pearl harbour and Saving private Ryan seep into the public's unconscious mind and change opinions.  For instance, how many people know that the American troops actually got stuck on the D-day beaches and had to be rescue
<br>
d by the British and French troops, very few indeed.
<br>
<p>Any idiot knows we got our asses kicked at Pearl Harbor. Many also know
<br>
that it was the destruction of our battleships there which was what
<br>
enabled us to win the war: it required our hidebound admirals to change
<br>
their strategy for once, to depend upon aircraft carriers as the primary
<br>
capital ship.
<br>
<p>The average idiot can also say they know that movies generally have
<br>
little connection with reality (the recutting of Pearl Harbor for a
<br>
Japanese audience's political sensibilities being a prime example of
<br>
this) in a broad sense, they are character focused dramas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While America continues it &quot;we rule the world&quot; attitude, no country will join the states, public opinion would be to much against it.  Britain also shares just as much in common with our European neighbours as it does with the states, even across the la
</em><br>
nguage barrier.
<br>
<p>Not by the news in Britain. Even the leftie labor man, Blair, is loathe
<br>
to go EU, only because he knows how unpopular it is. Note that Ireland
<br>
also rejected many EU policies and is instead going the American way,
<br>
cutting taxes and enjoying hugh high tech growth rates. A the center of
<br>
EU power drifts further east over time, I fully expect Britain and
<br>
Ireland to both seriously toy with joining NAFTA or FTAA, if not doing
<br>
so outright.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And lets face it, nut boy Dubya Bush hardly helps matters for increasing America's popularity, after trashing the Kyoto treaty, pulling out of the chemical weapons talks and starting up the old star wars program.  Most the world is carefully watching Am
</em><br>
erica at the moment, that well armed six year old seems to have been made president.
<br>
<p>And he just tolk you gun grabbing socialists to go stuff yourselves. I
<br>
note todays headlines in my local leftie rag hyperventilate over the
<br>
Bush Administration rejecting the bald faced attempt by the UN to get us
<br>
to surrender our 2nd amendment....
