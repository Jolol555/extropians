</em><br>
<p>That might be a valid point. But you could fix that with anti-trust laws
<br>
for that particular market.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Governments come about specifically because of this blind spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Individuals too squeamish to do their own dirty work empower
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This seems like utopian thinking, expecting too much of the people.
<br>
How would your citizen education program stop members in families,
<br>
partners of businesses, groups of families, and so on, from joining
<br>
forces?
<br>
<p>Another problem is to distinguish between products and services. The
<br>
trend that more and more product become services is generally sound.
<br>
Gives you more flexibibility and focus on customer value. What's the
<br>
difference between a protection agency and an advanced intelligent
<br>
defence system?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As soon as a person hires a large group to exert force for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them, all parties the person deals with are no longer operating in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free market, nor is the person operating in a free market with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the large group they have hired. If the large group mandates that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clients be unarmed, then they are totally at the mercy of the large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group.
</em><br>
<p>The group vs the individual is irrelevant. The balance of forces is not.
<br>
Your requirement for complete indivual balance seems theoretical. In practice
<br>
there will always be huge differences in strength.
