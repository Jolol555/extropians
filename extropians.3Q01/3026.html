<p>You said
<br>
<p>=============================================================
<br>
<em>&gt;In our society, this happens too often and we find bloodbaths, brutal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence, and warfare occurring around the world when conflicts spiral out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of control. We can also find censorship, pretensions of a harmonious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society and ambiguous doubletalk statements like &quot;everything has the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct point in accordance to their perspective&quot; when people attempt to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimize conflict and impose their way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You may wonder what if we all think rationally even when starting with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrational beliefs. In such a case, we will actively seek viewpoints 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contrary to our own to minimize guilt (of learning about the truth too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;late) and in our quest for a more accurate personal theory about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe. Eventually, through the free exchange of incompatible views and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from our seeking of more knowledge, we will come across a theory that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;satisfies all the logical prerequisites. Since this theory and our other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories will mutually exclude each other, so we can only believe in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory and only this theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hence, in a society with even one irrational member, we have to exercise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;censorship to prevent conflicts from occurring, or we will have to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside each other's influence. However, in a society with only rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;members, we will eventually come to a common consensus while enjoying free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speech. Hence, the paradox shows itself.
</em><br>
<p>===============================================================
<br>
<p>But doesn't the good ol' Enlightenment liberal framework deal with a lot of 
<br>
this stuff about social disagreement? We don't have to turn ourselves into 
<br>
ethical relativists (like J.R., I think that ethical relativism is a useless 
<br>
theory - though I am an ethical *subjectivist*, a slightly different sort of 
<br>
an animal), but we can live and let live about issues that are less 
<br>
important to us than freedom of conscience, belief and expression, getting 
<br>
along in a pluralist society, etc. Admittedly, there is then a &quot;market&quot; 
<br>
element in the way society develops, which some people don't like but I and 
<br>
most others here think is actually a good thing.
<br>
<p>A current hobbyhorse of mine is that it's time to stand up very strongly for 
<br>
what I'll call metapolitical views that leave space for transhumanist ideas 
<br>
to grow, and for transhuman technologies and ways of life to be developed 
<br>
and implemented by those who want them. I do think that the issue of 
<br>
metalevels in social values, social design, etc is pretty crucial and it's 
<br>
come up in different ways here lately.
<br>
<p>Since the 1960s when the first transhuman technology - the contraceptive 
<br>
pill - came on stream, all this has worked quite well in Western societies. 
<br>
However, there's now a realisation beginning that the classical liberal 
<br>
framework may allow society to develop in very radical ways - and the view 
<br>
is now being expressed pretty openly by people like Leon Kass that this must 
<br>
be stopped. How do we (as a society? as transhumanists?) handle this kind of 
<br>
difficulty?
<br>
<p>You've told us frankly in another post that you're only 18 and at an early 
<br>
stage in developing your ideas. But you certainly write well, and you're 
<br>
obviously smart enough to have found the smartest list in town &lt;grin&gt;, and 
<br>
we have to talk about these things anyway... so welcome to the conversation, 
<br>
as far as I'm concerned.
<br>
<p>Your only problem is that a lot of us have been thinking about these things 
<br>
for many years. We may not have the answers you want, but we've probably 
<br>
assimilated a lot of theory and terminology which you may have to engage 
<br>
with quickly. Just ask if that causes a communication difficulty. And we'll 
<br>
do likewise if your concepts aren't obvious.
<br>
<p>Good luck
<br>
<p>Russell
