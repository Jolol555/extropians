<p>There is no holy book that says that cloning is to be banned. 
<br>
There is none that claims outright that abortion is murder or
<br>
that evolution is bunk.  There are none that forbid looking to
<br>
see what cloning is and is not about or noting the different
<br>
varieties of cloning that are being studied and proposed and
<br>
responding based on that knowledge.  
<br>
<p>There are so-called religious &quot;leaders&quot; who will try to tell
<br>
everyon that they must think and act like the leader believes is
<br>
correct.  But relatively few sects support such group think and
<br>
even in those that do (e.g. Roman Catholic church) many of the
<br>
adherents do not believe their religion requires them to refuse
<br>
to think for themselves.  
<br>
<p>And again, the counter to ignorant claims and untruths in
<br>
service of a heinous position is to present the truth in order
<br>
to dispel the ignorance.  It is not helpful to attack the person
<br>
or their philosophy or religion directly.  It is especially
<br>
unhelpful to chalk up all that frustrates one's fondest wishes
<br>
to the those minions of yon evil group-think.
