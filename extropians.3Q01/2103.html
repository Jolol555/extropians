THE LIGHTHOUSE: July 23, 2001THE FBI AND AND THE X-FILES THE LIGHTHOUSE
<br>
&quot;Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...&quot;
<br>
Vol. 3, Issue 29
<br>
July 23, 2001
<br>
<p>The recent troubles of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are a far cry
<br>
from the nearly unanimous praise the agency received from the federal
<br>
government and the media for most of its life. Yet judging by the popularity
<br>
of the Fox-TV show &quot;The X-Files,&quot; the American public entertained doubts
<br>
about the FBI years before it had heard about Robert Hanssen, Wen Ho Lee, or
<br>
the agency's missing firearms and laptop computers.
<br>
<p>What a tidal change. Before the show debuted, Fox executives worried that
<br>
the show's political undertones, implying that the FBI routinely withheld
<br>
Important News from the public, would turn off too many viewers. Today, we
<br>
know &quot;The X-Files&quot; was the hit that put Fox on the map.
<br>
<p>&quot;One can see what an extraordinary development 'The X-Files' represents in
<br>
American popular culture by concentrating on the fact that, for all its
<br>
science-fiction and horror elements, it is fundamentally a series about the
<br>
FBI,&quot; writes Paul Cantor in the summer issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.
<br>
<p>&quot;As a TV advertiser might put it, however, this is not your father's FBI --
<br>
and certainly not J. Edgar Hoover's. Far from being the hero of the series,
<br>
as one might expect on American television, the federal agency is virtually
<br>
the villain.&quot;
<br>
<p>And the FBI's television villainy was not limited to bureaucratic
<br>
incompetence, although that was one aspect. &quot;As the series developed, it
<br>
began to suggest that the opposition to [main characters] Mulder
<br>
and Scully is the product of sinister forces working within the FBI or at
<br>
least exerting pressure on it from other branches of the federal government.
<br>
We gradually learn that this agency, which more than any other over the
<br>
years has represented the federal government's ability to uncover threats to
<br>
its citizens is being used as part of a plot to cover up the greatest threat
<br>
the American people have ever faced -- a worldwide conspiracy to aid aliens
<br>
in taking over the earth.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Alien takeover&quot; aside, the reality of the FBI's problems may simply be
<br>
inherent in the agency's operations as a government bureaucracy subject to
<br>
political whims and pressures.
