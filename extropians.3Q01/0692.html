<p>I presume you've spoken to your local political representative (judging
<br>
from your alias, of the S in SPQR)  about installing a public cam in his
<br>
villa's thermes, and he was unreserved enthusiastical about it?
<br>
<p>Of course, if cameras there are, they &quot;should&quot; be pointing both ways.
<br>
However, you might observe that solving the quis custodiet by mutual
<br>
snoopery, strangely, has not so far cropped up on the Big Brother's
<br>
agenda. They like keeping the tabs on you, unilaterally, and like to keep
<br>
it that way.
<br>
<p>A much simple solution would seem to not install the darn cams in the
<br>
first place, thus not granting the license to snoop, or revoking it,
<br>
where, foolishly, it was granted, using the usual political channels.
<br>
<p>Private cams be different, since they be not blanket.
