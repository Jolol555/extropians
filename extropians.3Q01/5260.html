<p>
The essentialism/antiessentialism debate revolves around what an object
<br>
is. Is it the actual thing or is it a linguistic object and hence
<br>
abstract and conceptual? I think it is a fascinating debate. Realize
<br>
when humans talk about the sun, moon, and starts there are no such
<br>
things in a person's head. The cranium just isn't large enough. Words
<br>
must stand for and represent supposed objects. What we do then is
<br>
mentally assemble objects together.
<br>
<p>I am a reductionist. When analysing I like to reduce to the greatest
<br>
possible detail, taking nothing for granted. I take as little as
<br>
possible on faith. But for any problem there is a set of &quot;givens&quot; or a
<br>
starting point from which to draw subsequent premises. Recognizing and
<br>
using givens, then, as an entry point to analysis, does not mean
<br>
anything is being taken on faith. A person must start somewhere.
<br>
Sometimes one can start in the middle and work both directions.
<br>
<p>Givens however, can be questioned infinitely, qualified and requalified
<br>
again and again. How far is established not by the essential nature of
<br>
the given, but by the perseverance and will of the analyst, and at what
<br>
point he feels satisfied. That is a valuation.
<br>
<p>When reducing, things change. One stands away and sees a forest. Moving
<br>
closer there are individual trees, then leaves, then chlorophyll. Many
<br>
cascading environments exist, one within the other. So what is reality?
<br>
<p>There is no reality without context. Often times when people make
<br>
reality statements what they are doing is asserting a context. They set
<br>
boundaries for logic and reason. How do you know what you think is
<br>
right? What is your criteria for right? Is it alignment with what other
<br>
people say? External validation? Or is it because you have tested all
<br>
your premises and assumptions, and you are happy with the way you think
<br>
as a rational human being?
<br>
<p>I had a very interesting debate concerning real versus ideal. Where does
<br>
one end and the other begin? There is no explicit line, and my argument
<br>
is when the vagueness and arbitrariness of this line is legitimately
<br>
brought up, the realist must yield. At that time it is necessary to
<br>
consolidate valuations, acknowledge valuations are being made, then move
<br>
forward with whatever is being done.

<em>&gt;&gt; I don't agree with Peikoff very much. Objectivism is just another form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of essentialism, and I do not like essentialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree analytic truths are necessary, as are other abstractions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reality being one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wasnt familiar with the term so I did some searching. Heres what I got:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/343888">http://www.xrefer.com/entry/343888</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Essentialism, in philosophy, is the doctrine that things have essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properties, properties without which they would not be the things that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are. Many philosophers hold that the essence of water is its real essence;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the essence of water is H2O. So the stuff in my glass has an essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property, a property without which it would not be the stuff that it is; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the stuff in my glass did not have the property of being H2O, then it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not be water.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anti-essentialists hold that there are no essential properties (properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without which things would not be the things that they are) independently of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our definitions and ways of classifying things. Being a rational animal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an essential property of humans, but this is merely because we have chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to define 'human' as 'rational animal', because we have chosen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classifying something as a human just if it is a rational animal. And things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not have essential properties independently of our definitions and ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of classifying things. AJ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Am I to understand about this Anti-essentialist view that &quot;there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essential properties independently of our definitions and ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classifying things&quot;. This goes to the heart of Rand's theory of concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formation. Heres an example of how one forms a concept. Imagine if you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3 balls. One is light blue, one is dark blue, and one is red. You notice an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attribute that is similar between 2 of the balls that the 3rd doesnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possess, even though this attribute differs in magnitude. You mentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;isolate this attribute and tag a lable on it, in english this label is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Blue&quot;. The attribute does in fact exist in reality, it does in fact exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for all people with the proper machinery to detect this fact (those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colorblind may not detect it, but a lack of information isnt a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contridiction). Man disnt make this up, this attribute is in fact an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;essential&quot; attribute of blue. It IS blue. In the example they use above, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you remove the attribute &quot;H2O&quot; from &quot;water&quot;, you dont have water anymore. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm off base on this, please explain. I really am interested in this branch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of philosophy. Thanks!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jerry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;P.S. I only push this to the list because it looks like others might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interested in this aspect of philosophy, if anyone thinks that its better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;served to discuss this elsewhere, just let me know and Ill drop it here.
