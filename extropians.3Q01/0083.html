<p>Yes.  And though Dr. Hobby had some generic affection toward the idea
<br>
of his Davids, he didn't seem to care very much for any one of them.
<br>
When one David destroyed another, he didn't react the way a father
<br>
would if one of his sons killed another one.  When Dr. Hobby comes
<br>
back to his office to find David gone, he doesn't seem to go searching
<br>
for him, or the copter he came in on, again.  Hey, if you lose one
<br>
David, just start up another.

</em><br>
<p>Right.  This scenario isn't at all absurd.  Considering how badly
<br>
humans have treated humans when it was in their interest, how badly
<br>
they regularly treat animals, how much more entitled people feel
<br>
regarding machines vs. nature, and how much trouble people have
<br>
believing machines could have an internal life, I'd say this is the
<br>
default scenario.  It is what will happen unless people work hard
<br>
to make it otherwise.
