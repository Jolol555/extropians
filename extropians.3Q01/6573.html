From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Sen.%20Judd%20Gregg%20(R-New%20Hampshire)%20called%20for%20a%20global%20prohibition%20on%20encryption&In-Reply-To=&lt;029801c13db0$07008ea0$825c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; remember that the clipper chip was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *crushed*. The fact that this idea was defeated once means that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually going to have a harder time today than it would if it was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely new concept with a clear background. Sure, it will get a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help from the current mood, but it is not an irresistible power.
</em><br>
<p>OIC, in that case what you wrote earlier, to wit: &quot;Note that we now are
<br>
essentially back to
<br>
square one with the clipper chip, but now with the added feature of
<br>
global prohibitions and a likely strong support from the public and
<br>
politicians&quot; no longer holds. So now we have not much to worry about. Okey
<br>
dokey artichokey. (Wish you'd settle on a single position though.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although my ambitious side does like the idea of me and Max being part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the controlling group - in this case I guess that would be NIST, NSA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or some high level court - &quot;infiltrating&quot; them is of course a total pipe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dream. You won't get a chance to control a technology if you lie about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your intentions to the surrounding administration.
</em><br>
<p>No need to &quot;lie about your intentions&quot; -- just let them know that you
<br>
represent the will of a huge proportion of the general public (which is true).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember, in our kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society you actually have to give reasons for your actions when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do them as part of an administration.
</em><br>
<p>Unless, of course, you're the President. hehehe
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A far more realistic approach to stop this technology is to raise hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it - explain to proponents why it won't work and why it will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty side effects, get the non-initiated to understand what is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it and why it should not be supported.  Convince other nations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not accept the standard. Develop other technologies that makes even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduction of the technology irrelevant. If it is passed, then work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the laws, even to the point of civil disobedience.
</em><br>
<p>Now you're talking, and it sounds good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Notice that this is messy, real world things that have to be done. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way of achiving it by wishing for the technology to be in wise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands (and mine definitely aren't; I think I could make a fairly nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator a la Trevor Goodchild if I got the chance - don't let me!).
</em><br>
<p>I think you're right about the messiness of the undertaking, and thankfully
<br>
there are many people who relish the opportunity to get their hands into this
<br>
messy project. As for you're aptitude for being a nasty dictator, thanks for
<br>
the warning, but it's my experience that folks who indulge in the kind of
<br>
self-deprecating comments you've made are usually quite even-handed and fair
<br>
in their administration of technological change.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
