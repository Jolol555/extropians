</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Are you familiar with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?  There is
<br>
some truth, here, I believe, that our terminology can indeed
<br>
affect our intuitions, feelings, and thoughts in ways that
<br>
can be detrimental.  Yes, I can imagine that relentless 
<br>
labeling of those who disagree with one as &quot;enemies&quot; or
<br>
&quot;opponents&quot; could grow to have this effect.
<br>
<p>But the possibility has been overblown, in my opinion.  The
<br>
high point of this view occurred in the 1950's.  Since then,
<br>
the counter-reaction has been that we are not so much damaged
<br>
or affected by our terminology as had been thought.  All
<br>
human languages, for example, are almost equally effective in
<br>
connoting, with some interesting exceptions.  But they're no
<br>
longer regarded as all powerful in shaping our thoughts.
<br>
Certainly &quot;If I cast them as opponents then I have effectively
<br>
declared ideological conflict and even war&quot; sounds too extreme
<br>
to me.  But I suppose that it's possible that this is indeed
<br>
how your mind works.
<br>
<p>Usually, today, if, let's say, it is found that some Administration
<br>
has an &quot;enemies list&quot;, it is considered symptomatic of how they were
<br>
thinking in the first place; it's not really supposed that they would
<br>
have had any less injurious disposition had they only thought of an
<br>
effective euphemism.
<br>
<p>There is definitely a trade-off here.  We can calmly begin to think
<br>
of &quot;those people who we disagree with&quot; when we fear that referring
<br>
to them as &quot;adversaries&quot; will bring to mind irrelevant memes.  On
<br>
the other hand, if you are confident that miscellaneous semantic
<br>
links *won't* lead you astray, you can and should feel perfectly
<br>
free to employ accurate terminology.
