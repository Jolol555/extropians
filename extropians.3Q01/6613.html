</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In each case these altered verses reverse the meaning of the original.

<em>&gt; This is ludicrous.  Extropians are believers in TRUTH.  Yet every time we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any sort of threat to our ideals, many people on this list start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventing all sorts of subterfuge and lies.  The archives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full of ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on infiltrating groups, committing crimes and blaming them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issuing false statements attributed to someone else, starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false rumors, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. You can win with the truth; descent into subterfuge and secrecy is
<br>
very bad. I see this all the time in business; it's the knee-jerk reaction
<br>
of 90% of execs when in conflict with other companies or when something goes
<br>
wrong. Must be hardwired into humans somewhere.
<br>
<p>But I liked the underlying core of the koran idea, if not them
<br>
implementation. As a culture (and including technology in this definition),
<br>
US core competency is not in fighting wars [rationale: the US doesn't want
<br>
to, not that it is technically bad at it]. US core competency is in
<br>
spreading the US cultural meme package -- you just have to look at China to
<br>
see how we're doing at that with a country where we're really trying.
<br>
Whatever anyone says, US companies and interests are fully engaged and
<br>
merged with Chinese companies and interests in my industry (wireless) and
<br>
many others; there is a great exchange of culture, ideas and technologies
<br>
going on right now.  Chinese and American businesspeople -- the politicians
<br>
and influencers and moneymen of tomorrow -- are open and friendly with one
<br>
another.
<br>
<p>If you look at where real non-negotiable problems in the world come from,
<br>
they seem to center around isolated countries and regions, those in which
<br>
the citizens cannot be a part of the global flow of knowledge. So taking the
<br>
book idea, we apply it to an equal mix of : a) educational materials (got to
<br>
make it easy for people who can read to teach those who can't), b) history
<br>
and cultural works relevant to the region we're dropping them on, c)
<br>
literature from around the world, d) books formed up of translated newspaper
<br>
digests from around the world.
<br>
<p>Then we get on and drop this stuff on a country.
<br>
<p>There's all sorts of tech solutions too (which is where we get fanciful):
<br>
<p>a) drop handhelds and chips instead of books. Use the simputers developed
<br>
for India; $200 each, rugged and simple.
<br>
<p>b) if you're going to invade someplace (which you really shouldn't -- see
<br>
point on core competency above), invade it in a small way to set up and
<br>
protect small distribution centers surrounding those recently-invented
<br>
book-binding devices that can run off books on demand. Propagate the devices
<br>
and the books they produce.
<br>
<p>c) hell, radios would work. Lots and lots of them; the wind-up clockwork
<br>
types.
<br>
<p>So anyway, back to the points: books are better than bombs. Isolationism
<br>
breeds worse terrorists. In a small world, the community can't afford to let
<br>
countries damage their own populations by sitting in the corner and not
<br>
participating. Or forcing them to do the same. Just build a big pipe for the
<br>
exchange of information between cultures, and let the market and human
<br>
nature do the rest.
