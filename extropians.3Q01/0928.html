<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Or, as Jessie Ventura reportedly said, &quot;Religion is for

</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If religiosity provides the cognitive crutch that some people need in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why not?  Yes, if people are going to entertain false beliefs,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is a big difference between debunking religion and making personal 
<br>
attacks upon those who are religious. I have to pull myself back from that 
<br>
tempting treat constantly (&quot;don't tease the christian, Miriam&quot;).
<br>
<p>I have a number of friends who are very religious. Most of them were 
<br>
indoctrinated at an early age. One in particular is one of the sharpest 
<br>
minds I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He is a lovely, gentle 
<br>
person and totally honest. When we were very young I used to try to get him 
<br>
to question his religion, but after a time I realised that he is too busy 
<br>
doing other cool stuff to spend time questioning his religion. He never 
<br>
rams it down anybody else's throat, so I stopped hassling about it. His 
<br>
work on computers may well benefit the extropians.
<br>
<p>We should probably avoid being bigotted about religious people... on the 
<br>
whole they have historically provided a terrific example of the ills of 
<br>
bigottry.
<br>
<p>As I say, I am a common offender in tending to dump on religion and the 
<br>
people who succumb to it, and have great trouble holding myself back... but 
<br>
hold ourselves back, I think we should. Perhaps we should concentrate on 
<br>
tactics to defuse the religious indoctrination of young minds.  :-/
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
