<p><em>&gt;  how we see things does change what exists or &quot;what is&quot;.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we live in a world of language, objectifications, and mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstractions. We do not relate to things so much as definitions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. How or what we define is therefore important.
</em><br>
<p>Why are you more certain that you live in a world of language,
<br>
objectification, and mental abstractions, than you live in a
<br>
world of earth, air, fire, and water?  Such things as language
<br>
could not exist were they not evolved in matter creatures, nor
<br>
could mental abstractions.  You are choosing to build up your
<br>
model of what the world is on top of very shaky ideas that you
<br>
can't even know that other people possess, because you can't
<br>
even know that there are other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cosmos does not &quot;act&quot; any way at all. Of itself the cosmos does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing.  The cosmos does not even exist unless we say it exists.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know that there is a &quot;we&quot;?  I suggest that your inference
<br>
that there are other people is much weaker than your inference that
<br>
there is a 3-D world outside your skin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Concepts come and concepts go. Those having usefulness remain.
</em><br>
<p>Remain where, in what?  In your head?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I challenge you to tell me what objective reality is. If you believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists you should be able to say what it is. Feel free to use as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screens full of text as necessary.
</em><br>
<p>It is not possible to *say* what objective reality is.  You can't
<br>
even say what an apple or a pencil *is*.  This is an indication of
<br>
aberrant, though mostly harmless, thinking.  Korzybski, on the other
<br>
hand, thought this quite un-sane.
