<em>&gt; There are statistical differences; I know of a number, but I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of most Latin American cultures aren't so punctual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other Americans tend to fall in between.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  And before you attack each sentence of the foregoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph in context or out, please insert the word &quot;statistically&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where appropriate.
</em><br>
<p>I am having as much difficulty trying to parse your &quot;logic&quot; as well.  The
<br>
rules of logic and the basic logical fallacies I was taught don't seem to be
<br>
the same as the ones you recognize.  The same is true of your &quot;statistics&quot;.
<br>
My graduate courses in statistical analysis for biology and psychology just
<br>
don't apply to the usages that your statistics seem to apply.  I wouldn't be
<br>
surprised if your basic math and scientific methods were fundamentally
<br>
different as well.  Although we seem to agree on the basics of using logic,
<br>
math, statistics and science as an approach to rationality, we seem to be
<br>
using incompatible algorithms underneath.
<br>
<p>Since I cannot even parse the logic of your assertion, I won't bother with a
<br>
disproof at this time.  However, I would be very curious to see any
<br>
references that also claim such a thing.  Are there any studies or
<br>
references to support your assertion that &quot;Cubans&quot; aren't as punctual as
<br>
&quot;Mormons&quot;?  Or is this just your own personal belief that you are sure that
<br>
logic and statistics would prove if anybody bothered.  If you just took a
<br>
belief and then assumed statistical support afterwards without doing the
<br>
math, I would be even less inclined to work out a disproof of your
<br>
statistics.
