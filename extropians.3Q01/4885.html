There was an interesting article in the SF Chron last week about
<br>
October's chess match between the current human champion and
<br>
a desktop computer/commercial grade software combination.  I
<br>
quote the article below with my comments in square brackets.
<br>
<p>When Michail Tal was asked after winning the world title in 1961
<br>
about the source of his sudden and brilliant ideas in chess, he
<br>
answered: &quot;Most certainly the black coffee I drink before each game.&quot;
<br>
<p>Today, if he were alive, the beloved Magician of Riga would likely
<br>
to be at risk under the new World Chess Federation (FIDE) drug
<br>
policy which allows only moderate caffeine intake during competitions.
<br>
[In the early 1980s, then-champion Anatoly Karpov would take large
<br>
doses of caffeine before each game.  Some accounts had it as the
<br>
equivalent of 10-12 cups of strong coffee.  Karpov is ~55 kg.  In a
<br>
particularly gruelling match against upstart Gary Kasparov, Karpov's
<br>
play collapsed, and the FIDE president stopped the match, declaring
<br>
K and K as world co-champions.  This bizarre incident nearly ruined
<br>
Karpov's health.]
<br>
<p>Although Tal was a man of extraordinary imagination, he would
<br>
doubtless have been surprised at the hoopla surrounding the recent
<br>
London press conference held to promote the upcoming Braingames
<br>
man-vs-computer match between Vladimir Kramnik and Deep Fritz.
<br>
[Disagree.  Tal would surely recognize the deep significance of what
<br>
is to take place this October.]
<br>
<p>The match was heralded as &quot;bigger than the thriller in Manila.&quot;
<br>
[thriller in Manila is, *I think* a reference to a world championship
<br>
boxing match from the early 70s.]  Kramnik was described as
<br>
&quot;having the icy focus of an assassin&quot; while Fritz was touted as the
<br>
strongest chess-playing machine ever.  [300 US$ software package
<br>
with quad processor 933 MHz P4 hardware.]
<br>
<p>Kramnik appeared at the conference accompanied by two former
<br>
world boxing champions acting as bodyguards; Fritz by a pair of
<br>
blond models dressed in dark suits and sunglasses.  [I would
<br>
rather be Fritz here.]
<br>
<p>Chess promoters are committed to commercializing chess on as
<br>
large a scale as possible.  But as Michael Tal would have been
<br>
the first to caution: in its essence a chess game is an expression of
<br>
man's capacity for play and art before it is a source of profit.
<br>
[Bah!  Humbug!  ALL art and play are great potential sources
<br>
of profit.  spike]
