<em>&gt; Indeed, but you instantly *plonked*ed back anyway. Samantha, I guess you

<p>I did no such thing.  It was a play on go f*** yourself over
<br>
what I considered an over-defensive reaction.  It was a joke.  I
<br>
prize Russell's posts too much to plonk him.  What is there you
<br>
don't appreciate?
<br>
<p>Opinions were offered on the subject not-to-discussed and then
<br>
discussion closed.  That didn't feel quite right and that was
<br>
all I meant to get across.  I don't see how what I said was so
<br>
all-fired offensive.
<br>
<p>I made some other points (I thought) about the dangers of
<br>
becoming not ourselves or posturing in order to draw more
<br>
allies.  I don't see why those weren't worth responding to
<br>
rather than taking offense.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...does not mean

<em>&gt; &gt;We are going to limit the power of the state by granting that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I also don't plan on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly read all this on my first pass as deep-coded thus: `Hey, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're not signed up 100 percent to the Charter, piss off out of here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who the hell are you anyway?' So I felt my own finger, too, drawn toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *plonk* key. That was probably an over-reaction, I decided, but still...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>WHAT?  Has the whole world gone mad?  I said nothing of the kind
<br>
and my history on this list does not in any way justify such an
<br>
outlandish interpretation.
