<p>Well, the political and cultural leaders won't, but the man on the street
<br>
sure will. And the basis will ultimatively decide the policy, by voting
<br>
the right people into office.
<br>
<p>Can any U.S. residents provide data points on the current memetic climate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Condemnation of Islamism would be interpreted by Moslems all over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world as the simple rhetoric of inter-religious bigotry and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition.  In other words, condemning Islam for what it is would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard by Moslems as the same kind of rhetoric that has fueled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inter-religious wars throughout history, no different than the kind of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars of the Reformation.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe the age of religious tolerance is over. At this day and age I
<br>
frankly fail to see the utility of a religion, especially an exclusive
<br>
religion still in the rabid fanatic phase. If a religion engenders
<br>
excessive fanatism, the separation of church/state is no longer
<br>
sustainable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemnation of Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be interpreted by the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, our public discourse is condemned to a fundamental impotence: We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot as a civilization even TALK about the root cause of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<p>I've made the observation that Chechen strategy of carrying terror acts
<br>
into the capital made that particular ethnic group rather unpopular with
<br>
the guy on the street (an understatement), which promptly yielded
<br>
political card blanche for essentially total war, only holding back at
<br>
WOMD use (with the use of fuel-air explosives the boundaries blurring).
<br>
Maybe U.S. will not retaliate on quite the same scale, but this will
<br>
certainly have direct impact on immigration policy, religion politics and
<br>
racial hatred.
<br>
<p>The pattern is not new, nor pretty. Similiar to you, I don't see any
<br>
solutions rather than excessive moderation on both sides. Fat chance.
<br>
Judging from past behaviour pattern, U.S. will retaliate, and the
<br>
magnitude of the attack will result in a further spiral of mutual
<br>
polarization, down the slippery slope.
