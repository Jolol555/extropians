<p><em>&gt; In principle there are people who are motivated to lie awake at night
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the farm workers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had forgotten about them.  Under suitable conditions (e.g.,
<br>
if there is enough freedom) what you say will occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they can offer better working conditions, they can increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their profit margins, just as providing better selling conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the supermarket will increase profits of market owners.
</em><br>
<p>The mechanism that you allude to here might not be clear to all the
<br>
people reading this.  What Hal is saying is that by offering better
<br>
working conditions, an employer can attract workers.  If one employer
<br>
is successful enough, then he can drive out of business those bosses
<br>
who fail to provide such benefits (unless those other businesses are
<br>
receiving government assistance, or are part of a &quot;program&quot;, or
<br>
have some other non-market advantage).  The reason that those other
<br>
employers will go out of business is that they will find it too hard
<br>
to get workers.  Obscene profits also help:  If an employer finds a
<br>
way to make great gobs of money (and the government doesn't quickly
<br>
find ways of punishing him for doing so), then other entrepreneurs---
<br>
who are equally &quot;greedy&quot; (we should say 'self-interested') will
<br>
quickly imitate the guy who is making &quot;obscene&quot; profits.  But
<br>
in order to be competitive (i.e. try to drive the first employer
<br>
out of business), they will have to either lower the prices of the
<br>
goods that they charge the consumers (so that the first employer
<br>
can't find customers) or raise the salaries of their employees (so
<br>
that the first employer can't find workers).
<br>
<p>This is how the system does and should work, despite the short-term
<br>
transition costs when there are either too many workers in a field,
<br>
or not enough, or too few entrepreneurs, or too many (who are forced
<br>
to resort to layoffs).  This system has made a number of countries
<br>
very rich and very powerful, but even in those very countries, the
<br>
process described here is hardly understood and seldom appreciated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the reason why the motivation doesn't work as well for farm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employers (and employers in general) compared to sellers, is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder for people to change jobs than to change supermarkets.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but often (to continue to use my example of the supermarket
<br>
manager) the employer *does* also think about how happy his or 
<br>
her employees are, and worries when the Safeway down the street
<br>
has found a new package of benefits or something for employees
<br>
that raises the pressure on him or her to do the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; right away, but providing better jobs will have relatively less of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect because people don't like to change jobs, for a lot of reasons.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the effect is slower, I'm sure.  
<br>
<p>The real problem with the farm workers is that there are so many poor
<br>
people outside the United States, especially in Mexico, who will gladly
<br>
take the jobs despite the conditions.  As Brian Philips remarked, 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We must consider this... what would be the situation for these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the farmers had no jobs to offer them?  Would you rather the children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat or have them have daycare by a parent?  Perspective here is important.
</em><br>
<p>I think that what liberals would like to do is to decide on a certain
<br>
fixed number of people who can come (period!) to work in the U.S. from
<br>
other countries, and *not* let them bid against each other for the
<br>
privilege.  That is, to take our southern border as an example, some
<br>
fixed individuals would be permitted in AND THEN NO MORE, and then
<br>
the federal government would force the growers to pay them minimum
<br>
wage (which would be about fifteen dollars an hour if the liberals got
<br>
their way---ever tried to live on less?), and if the growers went 
<br>
bankrupt, well, in the immortal words of Hilary Clinton, &quot;Don't blame
<br>
me if a lot of under-capitalized companies go under.&quot;
