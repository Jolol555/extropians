Regarding "infinitely fast computers":  There is more than one concept<br>
that can be defined here. <br>
<p>
One precise and mathematically consistent (so far as we know) concept of<br>
an "infinitely fast computer" is called a "machine with an oracle for the<br>
halting problem". This concept is used in the fields of "recursive<br>
function theory"  and "computational complexity".  Imagine a Turing<br>
machine T in which during execution you can write another Turing machine<br>
description M on a tape and then enter an "oracle query state". The<br>
machine T in the next step then enters either a state indicating that<br>
machine M would halt or a state indicating that machine M would not halt.<br>
<p>
Machines with oracles for the halting problem are very powerful. By<br>
definition, they can solve the halting problem for standard Turing<br>
machines. Also, given a collection of axioms A and a proposition P one can<br>
use the machine to determine if P is derivable from A or if (not P) is<br>
derivable from A. Hence you can solve typical open mathematical<br>
conjectures (or show P is independent of A).<br>
<p>
See, for example, question seven on the following exam:<br>
<a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~csunion/exams/CSC320_F95_Final.html">http://gulf.uvic.ca/~csunion/exams/CSC320_F95_Final.html</a><br>
<p>
Do not expect to find machines with oracles for the halting problem in<br>
CompUSA stores soon.  I believe there is currently no known way to build<br>
such machines.  Whether we will discover physical principles that would<br>
allow such machines to be built in the future is unknown in my opinion. <br>
(Deeper issues of testability and Occam's razor would also be raised.)<br>
<p>
Note, it is possible to imagine even more powerful machines. For example,<br>
consider a machine with an oracle for "machines with oracles for the<br>
halting problem". This is a provably more powerful machine. Indeed, one<br>
can imagine an entire hierarchy of more powerful machines. This notion and<br>
many others are investigated in recursive function theory.  So just saying<br>
"infinitely fast computer" is somewhat ill-defined - there are different<br>
"varieties".<br>
