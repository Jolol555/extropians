<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;It may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But their development cycles are shorter than many other candidates.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This would mean more wetware experiments can be done in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of time.  (Of course, if we come to a better understanding of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the genetics involved, computer simulations might be the way to go...)</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that a short development cycle also may limit<br>
intelligence. Humans have the longest childhood of all animals<br>
(measured as the fraction of normal adult lifespan in the wild),<br>
likely because we need a lot of time to leanr and absorb our culture's<br>
memes. Neotony may be the way to go for uplift, but that would slow it<br>
down a lot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree, but do not want to get bogged down in a we-must-have-them-</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking-English-with-a-Brooklyn-accent-or-we've-failed attitude.  Also,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it might be easier to increase intelligence overall and worry about</i><br>
<i>&gt; language later.  Or the two might be related in such a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt; upgrading one ability feeds into the other.</i><br>
<p>
I never said we needed *human* language. If we could make the octopi<br>
communicate better with skin color, it would be a great step. The idea<br>
is that if different individuals can communicate, then they can also<br>
learn more from each other and we get more help in the uplift process<br>
by the uplifted species itself, since it will begin to expand its<br>
memetic niche.<br>
