Is global warming trendy pseudo science with a statist control eco- agenda?<br>
 Or is it a merely climatological fluctuation delaying the next  ice age?  The<br>
 basic physics, of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) and increased temperature is<br>
 well known.  The historical data for the last few hundred thousand years seems<br>
 to show a correlation between CO2 and temperature.  But it is not clear, does<br>
 warming cause increased CO2, or does increased CO2 cause warming?   In either<br>
 case, the CO2 levels go up and down naturally, thousands of years before<br>
 humans burned hydrocarbon fuel. Even more interesting are the cyclical<br>
 patterns of cooling and warming every few 10,000 years or so.  There are<br>
 several frequencies of cycles in both the CO2 and temperature data.  The cause<br>
 of these  big cycles and  little cycles is still unknown. Numerous theories<br>
 have linked some fluctuations to earth's orbit,  or continental drift,  but<br>
 subtle links to solar activity cycles has recently come forward.  I am<br>
 currently placing my bets on a slightly brighter sun, as a major factor in the<br>
 current warming.    There  are tiny climate  fluctuations and patterns perhaps<br>
 best explained with fractal mathematics or chaos theory as applied to<br>
 dynamical systems. Rather than get whipped up into climatic speculation, let<br>
 us look at the data.  Lots of hard work has been done figuring  out  the<br>
 temperature  history of the earth.  Numerous ice cores, ocean sediment cores,<br>
 chemical analyses later, scientists have charted the temperature over the past<br>
 thousands even million years.  Dates and temperatures are correlated through<br>
 historical records, tree rings, pollen counts, and isotope ratios of  oxygen<br>
 in ice.  The real data are usually not shown in the newspapers, so the average<br>
 citizen has no context to decide if a 2 degree warming in the next 100 years<br>
 is significant.  The media at the behest of government environmental scare<br>
 mongers has no interest in displaying the facts.  The facts are that the<br>
 global climate fluctuates all of the time.  You can check the data fo<br>
 The Vostok ice core data ia available on the web.  Point your browser<br>
 to <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu">http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu</a>.  Go to their search engin, type Vostok,<br>
 and follow the links.   Who is to say that the current climate is optimum?<br>
 Examination of the data indicates temperature and CO2 are certainly not<br>
 stable.  A “global warming investigator”  130,000 years ago, looking at the<br>
 data, would come to the conclusion that the CO2 is increasing, and the climate<br>
 is warming.  “ Oh NO” Grok, “we had better stop burning those camp fires !”<br>
 Why do we assume stability, when the data do not support  our fond hopes.    <br>
 Global warming proponents claim the earth will be warmer in the next century<br>
 than ever before.  Wrong,  130,000 years ago, the earth was  much warmer than<br>
 today.  Carbon dioxide was also higher.     More recently,  there was a warmer<br>
 period called the medieval optimum.  In the history this coincided with the<br>
 age of the Vikings.  From the year 900 to 1200 the climate in the northern<br>
 hemisphere was warmer than today..  Oats and barley were regularly grown in<br>
 Iceland.  There were wine vineyards in England.  Canadian forests were tens of<br>
 kilometers north of present lines and the Vikings inhabited Greenland.  All<br>
 totalled, climate estimates are 1.8 to  3.6F warmer than today.  This warm<br>
 spell did not last, by the 14th century, the Vikings abandoned their northern<br>
 settlements, and the English vineyards declined.   There was a mini-ice age<br>
 after 1450AD to about 1650, where glaciers in Europe advanced, springs were<br>
 delayed sufficiently to cause crop failures.   Canals in Holland, normally ice<br>
 free, were frozen over along with the Thames.  This is associated with a<br>
 sunspot minimum, known as the Maunder minimum, where solar activity was quite<br>
 low.  The current “inter-glacial period” is quite warm.  This is good.  If we<br>
 slide back into an ice age (as scientists were predicting in the 1950 and<br>
 1960s), a 200 foot thick sheet of ice grinding over our houses and farms would<br>
 be really a drag.  I have also hear  the argument that the  , “<br>
gs faster than previous<br>
 cycles.  Wrong, the  warming after the “Younger Dryas cooling” 11,500 years<br>
 ago was rapid.  An estimated 7C rise in nearly 50 years.    No  man-made CO2<br>
 emissions to blame there.  <br>
 Current international pressure, UN stuff, with Al Gore  cheerfully making<br>
 impassioned pleas for governmental controls on green house emissions. Gore is<br>
 quoted as saying that the threat of global warming is the greatest  threat the<br>
 country faces. Really, more than poverty, more than declining wages for the<br>
 workers, more than an uneducated population?     But  all  this is  policy<br>
 based upon software models, complex computer simulations, where the outcomes<br>
 involve major economic impacts.   The state of current climate models is<br>
 rather crude, as can be seen in the accuracy of rudimentary weather<br>
 prediction.  The warming partisans cannot predict the weather accurately two<br>
 days or weeks ahead, but blithely assert predictions based on simulations 20<br>
 and 200 years ahead. <br>
  The warming propagandists and government  activists frequently fail to<br>
 mention the green house gas  with the largest  impact .  What is it?  Water<br>
 vapor !  Many uncertainties exist in the models, such as the many feed back<br>
 processes, involving the oceans,  or the way to model clouds.  One of the big<br>
 feed back mechanisms is the reflection  of solar energy (heat) by clouds back<br>
 into space.  When the earth heats up, more clouds form, reflecting more energy<br>
 back into space,  causing a cooling effect.  Clouds are subtle, their fractal<br>
 variety is still beyond a computer simulations plugging some average cloud<br>
 reflectivity coefficient or formula into the computer code.  There are<br>
 problems with the models prediction of regional  warming.  One recent model<br>
 that predicted an average warming due  to CO2 emissions, showed areas as big<br>
 as western Canada warming, when actually a cooling was observed.  Antarctica<br>
 is getting cooler.  One model predicts this , many others do not  describe<br>
 this empirical finding.  <br>
 <br>
 And much recent data, shows a cooling. The earth m<br>
 show a small warming at<br>
 the surface, but satellite measurements show the atmosphere cooling slightly.<br>
 This was written in earlier posts.  0.05C per decade in some linear regression<br>
 over 20 years is meaningless in the context of the last 1000,  10,000 and<br>
 100,000 years.   While some may say, these issues are complex, so we defer to<br>
 the preponderance of scientific opinion on global warming.  But the consensus<br>
 of scientists is not nearly so monolithic as the main stream press would have<br>
 us believe.  Dr.Fred  Singer has a statement opposing the global warming<br>
 hysteria, signed by  over 100 PhDs, top  professors of meterology (U of I ,<br>
 MIT U of Arizona...), weather service directors etc.  The decision is too<br>
 important to leave to speculation.  The  computer models are not that accurate<br>
 !  <br>
  On shaky grounds for science, and possessing powerful rhetoric, why does the<br>
 enviroestablishment want a reduction of economic activity?  Their vision is<br>
 that of zero population growth, less industry, returning to a totally<br>
 unrealistic idyllic rural ecotopia.  Instead of viewing more people as a<br>
 valuable resource, they view more people as a burden.  This is the misrabilist<br>
 view point.  The more people we have, the more ideas, the more crafty<br>
 inventiveness, and  problem solving we also have.  Implicit in this is the<br>
 rate of solving problems is greater than the rate of creating problems.  This<br>
 assumes that people are educated and skillful in technical methods.  The<br>
 answer of course moare Extropy.<br>
 Or the misguided policy might be a plan to stabilize the gap between wealthy<br>
 Americans or countries and the poorer citizens or developing countries.  The<br>
 earth’s rotation is slowing down also.  Do we expect a massive government<br>
 effort to speed up the rotation?  The bureaucrats want to create an atmosphere<br>
 where the government will solve all of our problems.  It is the old<br>
 centralized control model,  which proved too slow for the communist<br>
 bureaucracies to prepare for the 21st century. For the centralized<br>
 bureaucrats, a global warming control<br>
s a wonderful exercise in self<br>
 perpetuation. <br>
 William Calvin, in his wonderful book, The Ascent of Mind,  has made an<br>
 excellent case that the warming and cooling associated with the ice age cycle<br>
 has been a major influence for the increase of human intelligence and<br>
 evolution.  Will the current temperature changes spur further gain in<br>
 intelligence?  Or, will the natural changes,  be a used as a weapon for the<br>
 benighted forces of stupidity and regression?   <br>
 Instead of restricting energy use, we should be  spending lots of energy<br>
 preparing a life boat... climate control and space migration.<br>
