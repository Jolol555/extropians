<i>&gt; Theoretically, collisions between two cars identical except in mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to damage the lighter car more. (Practically, this is often</i><br>
<i>&gt; incorrect because other, unequal factors such as design dominate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought to show</i><br>
<i>&gt; the danger of light cars in recent light/heavy crash tests; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; light cars reportedly came off better until stronger heavy cars and</i><br>
<i>&gt; flimsier light cars were substituted.) This idealized theory leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; some to propose that you should drive a heavier car--thus reducing</i><br>
<i>&gt; such collisions' risk to yourself while raising others' risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; correspondingly(70a,70b)</i><br>
<p>
Thats exactly what Nader et al are complaining about. THey blame big<br>
vehicles for the increased traffic deaths in the smaller vehicles they<br>
hit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the right answer is to make all cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; (71a,71b)s afe whatever their weight, without putting all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; adjustment burden on light cars. Heavier vehicles should be made</i><br>
<i>&gt; less aggressive (Kdser 1992)--softer, less angular, more</i><br>
<i>&gt; absorptive, with bigger ridedown distances--and the road fleet's</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass distribution should be further narrowed, e.g. by incentives</i><br>
<i>&gt; for replacing inefficient with efficient cars (section 11). Heavy</i><br>
<i>&gt; lorries  with slightly relaxed length limits could even be equipped</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a highly energy-absorbing structure on the front to help</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect any car they might hit (M. Seal, personal communication, 24</i><br>
<i>&gt; March 1993).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Right answer for who??? If you want a safe efficient little car, you<br>
should pay for the cost of the added safety. DOn't put the burden on me.<br>
So I should sacrifice my right to good vehicle performance just so you<br>
in your dinky little rice burner don't get flattened when you cut me<br>
off?? Sorry, not gonna happen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Better control of destructive driver behaviour such as drunkenness</i><br>
<i>&gt; is often crucial: behaviour may be up to a thousandfold more</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk-determining than the car itself (L. Evans, personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication, 1992), and only about a twentieth of crashes do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; involve driver factors (Evans 1991). </i><br>
<p>
Of course, but people who can only afford a small cheap car cause they<br>
are too much of an alcoholic to save money for a vehicle more fitting,<br>
or safe, or enjoyable. Don't put the burden on me for their problems.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; But as to the car, modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; designs and materials can do far better than Henry Ford had in mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; when, in 1926, he said that " A heavy man cannot run as well as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; trim man. You do not need weight for strength"; (S. Abouzar,</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal communication, 3 July 1991).</i><br>
<p>
Thats accelerating performance. To disprove the usefulness of this<br>
quote, take a 98 lb weakling in the end zone of a football field. Take a<br>
240 lb linebacker in the opposite end zone. Have them accelerate to full<br>
speed, and hit each other head on. Who do you think is going to be more<br>
seriously hurt????<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; GM's Ultralite confirms that mass per unit volume can be cut by</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than half below the "steel plateau" level. This decoupling</i><br>
<i>&gt; permits fuel-efficient cars to remain ultralight while combining</i><br>
<i>&gt; roomy interiors with ample crush length, which appears to improve</i><br>
<i>&gt; crash performance somewhat. Yet better materials and design can</i><br>
<i>&gt; also substitute for crush length.</i><br>
<p>
At what cost????<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Composites and other ultrastrong net-shape materials--many stronger</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the familiarly durable but lower-grade carbon-fibre fishing</i><br>
<i>&gt; rods, skis, etc.--would dominate in a hypercar. They would bounce</i><br>
<i>&gt; without damage in minor fender-bender collisions: most deformations</i><br>
<i>&gt; of carbon-fibre composite panels simply pop out again with little</i><br>
<i>&gt; or no damage. Under severe loads, composite structures fail very</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently than metal, so "totally different design concepts have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be applied", and understanding of failure modes is not yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; mature. However, even under compressive loading--often considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; composites' weak point(72b,72a,)"Composite structural</i><br>
<i>&gt; elements...show high and in many cases better energy absorption</i><br>
<i>&gt; performance than comparable metal structures" (Kindervater 1991)</i><br>
<i>&gt; (73a,73b) Extensive aerospace experience is available from</i><br>
<i>&gt; designing all-composite structures and aircraft (like the Stealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; bomber and fighter) to withstand bird and stone strikes, landing</i><br>
<i>&gt; stress, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Sure one hit and you throw the entire car away. A metal body can be<br>
easily bent back to shape at a body shop in many accidents. This is<br>
another reason why insurance rates are going up. A higher percentage of<br>
vehicles in accidents are declared total losses than when metal was the<br>
norm.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Light metals would also be used where appropriate, such as in</i><br>
<i>&gt; sections of crushable light-metal foam or honeycomb for energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; management in a serious crash. These materials, available for two</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades (APS 1975), have a nearly perfect square-wave</i><br>
<i>&gt; response--they squash flat, absorbing enormous energy, before</i><br>
<i>&gt; transmitting crash accelerations--making them an ideal substitute</i><br>
<i>&gt; for ridedown length.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
snipping the rest of a mostly excellent post. <br>
<p>
However, as we were originally comparing IC vs EV, and I was trying to<br>
compare apples to apples (production IC vs. production EV) and you went<br>
off on the hyperbody digression, which is all very good and all, but you<br>
have yet to:<br>
<p>
 a) show any comparative studies between advanced construction,<br>
ultralightweight small cars hitting a moose or equivalent object, with a<br>
current Chevy Suburban or Grand Cherokee, or my brothers 1/2 ton pickup<br>
truck. No matter what studies you cite, you still can't dispute the 98<br>
lb track runner vs. 240 lb. football lineman collision, which is the<br>
easiest demonstration of what I am talking about.<br>
<p>
b) An IC with a similarly constructed body would exact the same<br>
efficiency gains from it as an EV power train would, so using such<br>
construction to increase the efficiency of EVs apples and oranges.<br>
