<i>&gt; Mobile phones are</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful in this regard, and I suppose eventually very very small video</i><br>
<i>&gt; cameras will be built into phones, which would be a great way to record</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good point. The MIT wearable group have suggested that<br>
wearable computers with video cameras make a good crime deterrent (and<br>
I think somebody suggested on this list, last time the subject came<br>
up, that if you show signs of high anxiety level and stand still, the<br>
wearable will start transmitting pictures automatically to people who<br>
might call the police for you if you are robbed). David Brin had<br>
glasses with a similar function in _Earth_ (and old people driving<br>
teenagers nuts by *watching* them intently). <br>
<p>
Overall, the mobile phone is already transforming our society<br>
immensely in unexpected directions.<br>
<p>
Not all defenses against violence need to be direct counter-violence,<br>
although surveillance is hardly a solution to all forms of violence<br>
either; the local transport company here in Stockholm has recently<br>
fielded a new model of subway cars with video cameras, in order to<br>
make people feel more "secure". But the events that make people the<br>
most insecure usually involve drunk or drugged offenders which most<br>
likely are not rational enough to worry about surveillance cameras.<br>
<p>
In general, a more well-connected social network seems to be both<br>
psychologically healthy and gives better security (not necessarily<br>
along the lines "If you hit me, I'll tell my friend Don<br>
Fettuchini...", but it helps :-). This is an area where social<br>
technology (like mobile phones, wearables etc) might come in handy.<br>
