Tony Hollick (who else?) writes<br>
:     ...   Classical Mechanics is the<br>
:     most self-consistent, the conceptually clearest, the strongest, the<br>
:     most coherent, the most extendable and the most adaptable Scientific<br>
:     Research Programme the world has ever seen.  And one theory does it<br>
:     all.  Why use anything else, is all.  "Simplify! Simplify!"<br>
<p>
It's certainly clear, simple, etc.  It just happens not to be the simplest,<br>
most coherent explanation *of certain real-world phenomena*.  Why do you<br>
think physicists changed course after 1901?  Planned obsolescence?<br>
<p>
:     As a matter of fact, I think it's actually _true_.  I've never read a<br>
:     convincing refutation of Classical Mechanics.  Someone would have to<br>
:     disprove one or more of the axioms; or break the deductive chains.<br>
:     I don't think that's actually possible.  Does anyone here think that<br>
:     geometry is _empirically decidable_?  I.e. Euclid vs. Minkowski or<br>
:     Euclid vs. Riemann ?  Do tell!!!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
Oh.  So if I understand you right, mere *empirical* evidence won't break<br>
classical mechanics - you can always add enough epicycles to preserve a<br>
classical *description* of the phenomena.  There comes a time, though,<br>
when folks get tired of piling epicycle on epicycle, and look for a<br>
simpler formalism.<br>
<p>
I've heard that Gauss went up three mountains and measured, as seen from<br>
each, the angle between the other two; added up the angles and found that<br>
space is locally flat to within the error in his procedure.<br>
<p>
:     Classical Mechanics is certainly exactly accurate to the present<br>
:     limits of measurement, AFAICS.  It shows every prospect of extension<br>
:     without limit - it scales cleanly from cosmic down to the microworld.<br>
