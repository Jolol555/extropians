<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So tell me what does this mean? Probability? Was this bound to</i><br>
happen?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; How many times have you had these feelings and they've been wrong? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in my case the answer is 'lots'. And how do you know that you ever</i><br>
had<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; those feelings and they aren't just false memories created after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact? Did you write anything down at the time?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I think our brains go wrong far, far more often than most</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; us realise, and that explains an awful lot of 'psychic'</i><br>
experiences...<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and why they can't be reproduced in a laboratory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Obviously it's natural to have those types of feelings and be</i><br>
wrong. <br>
<i>&gt; Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; course it happens more than not.  But when instance after instance</i><br>
occur,<br>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tend to wonder.  And of course I can't prove to you they are false</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that happened after fact, I can only tell you honestly, that was my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; experience; that's what happened.  I'm not going to forget the events</i><br>
<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; happened in an instance like that.  On the contrary I remember them</i><br>
quite<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clearly.  No I didn't right anything down at the time, but when I first</i><br>
<i>&gt; had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that "vision" of the yellow rider truck, I did mention it to my mother,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at the time I didn't think it was overly significant, but she still can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recall me mentioning it.  And also right after I put down the phone</i><br>
with<br>
<i>&gt; my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; friend, and then came back, I told him what had happen.  I told several</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people directly after the incedent.  And they all can recall what I</i><br>
said.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And as far as brains "going wrong" (whatever you exactly mean by that),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; perhaps that will explain some failures in attempt to reproduce in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; laboratory, but what about those psychic experiences in which someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mention of something ahead of time and it happens to come true.  Are</i><br>
all<br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our brains "going wrong" coneviently at the same time?</i><br>
