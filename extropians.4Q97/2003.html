Given the $95 price tag on membership mentioned in the most recent<br>
Exponent newsletter, this may not be too likely.  Of course, it may<br>
drive signal people away as well.  A list membership fee of $8 hit the<br>
list hard some years ago.  $95?  I don't think I can justify that to<br>
myself.  And the "benefits" were interesting: a t-shirt, mug, or<br>
mousepad, oh my.<br>

More interesting is the right to "sponsor one new member".  This implies<br>
either that future membership will be restricted to those spoken for by<br>
members, which is disturbing, or (more likely) that a current member<br>
gets to bring in one new one for free.  Perhaps people will be more<br>
likely to spring for that than paying lower fees and sponsoring their<br>
friends directly.  To me, it seems odd.  And expensive.<br>

        A priest was walking along the cliffs at Dover when he came<br>
upon two locals pulling another man ashore on the end of a rope.  "That's<br>
what I like to see" said the priest, "A man helping his fellow man."<br>
        As he was walking away, one local remarked to the other, "Well,<br>
he sure doesn't know the first thing about shark fishing."<br>
