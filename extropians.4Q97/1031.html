<i>        &gt;The 'Big Bang' stuff is unscientific, </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Because the speed of light is finite, telescopes are time machines.  <br>
What is unscientific in a theory about something you can see?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;untestable,</i><br>
<p>
              <br>
The Big Bang predicted that as our telescopes got bigger we would find that  <br>
billions of years ago the galaxies were closer together than they are now. <br>
We have. <br>
<p>
The observable universe has a radius of 10 to 20 billion light years,  <br>
the big bang theory predicts that we will never find an object in it older  <br>
than 10 to 20 billion years. So far at least nobody has, although some things  <br>
are getting close<br>
<p>
In 1949 George Gamow used the Big Bang theory to predict that the universe  <br>
would be full of microwave black body radiation at a temperature of about  <br>
5 degrees Kelvin. It was a wild idea and the Big Bang was not very popular so  <br>
few paid much attention to Gamow, then 20 years later the largest feature in  <br>
the universe was actually found experimentally, it had the spectrum of a <br>
black body and a temperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin. To a first approximation  <br>
the universe IS the blackbody radiation, the other stuff is just debris, so I  <br>
don't think a theory that predicts such a huge feature is doing too badly.  <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and arguably physically impossible.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Well, let's hear your argument. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It owes its fell origin to the disastrous philosphical memes which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;invaded the scientific community at the turn of the century.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Big Bang was unknown at the turn of the century and only became popular <br>
in the 60's when the evidence for it overwhelmed competing theories.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Logical positivism said: "You cannot disuss a universe you cannot         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;observe.  Thus, the univere is _defined_ as that which you can see </i><br>
<i>        &gt;i.e. a titchy one, around 5 000 light-years across."</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I'm certainly not a logical positivist but that characterization is unfair, <br>
they're not that dumb.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;embedded moralities and epistemologies of physical theories, most of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;which are _appalling_.    </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The appalling and crazy idea is that morality can be deduced from a physical <br>
theory or that a physical theory can be deduced from morality.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Don't import your enemies' anti-extropic concepts all unwitting.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can think of no idea more anti-extropic than that we can determine a law of <br>
physics or the nature of the cosmos by wishing. The Big Bang either happened <br>
or it did not and human political theories do not matter a hoot in hell.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Instead, our evolving Open Universe is infinite in all directions         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(Smass, Length and Time), with emergent --  novel -- qualities</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's a catchy phrase and I loved Dyson's book but infinity in all directions <br>
is not needed.  An infinite, never ending sequence of novel qualities is not  <br>
dependent on infinite linear space, or an infinite number of particles, <br>
or even an infinite amount of proper time, but only on a infinite amount of <br>
phase space.  If the universe collapses and gets hotter without limit then <br>
the information in it can also increase without limit, not by storing <br>
information in the  position of particles, that will keep getting less <br>
important, but by storing  information in the momentum of particles.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Einstein's old GR idea of a closed but unbounded Riemannian space         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;where nothing ever changes (determinist) is defunct </i><br>
              <br>
What is defunct about closed but unbounded Riemannian space?  <br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;Einstein himself said it GR was in error many times.    </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not quite. Einstein never lost confidence in his theory and even today no <br>
reputable physicist has, unless you're talking about the singularity at the <br>
center on a black hole, or when things gets smaller than the Plank length of <br>
10^ -33 centimeters or events get shorter than 10^-45 seconds.<br>
<p>
Einstein discovered General Relativity in 1917 and the equations said that  <br>
the universe must be expanding or contracting, at the time he thought this   <br>
disagreed with observation so he was forced to stick on a new term, a  <br>
"cosmological constant" to make the universe static. He always said he hatted <br>
it because it was ugly and detracted from the beauty of his theory, but he <br>
could see no alternative. <br>
<p>
In 1929 Hubble found that the universe was not static after all but was  <br>
expanding, everybody was surprised and a few were delighted. Einstein  <br>
certainly wasted no time, in the very same year he cheerfully abandoned the  <br>
cosmological constant and called it "the worst blunder of my career".    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic Cardinal, proposed in [1440] an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;infinite Euclidean Universe </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And he was wrong. The universe may or may not be infinite but it is certainly <br>
not Euclidean, if it were gravity could not exist. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This predated Copernicus!     </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
And takes nothing away from Copernicus. A scientific theory is more than   <br>
vague armchair philosophy, it must make testable predictions and produce  <br>
numbers, Copernicus's theory could do that, especially after the improvements  <br>
made by Kepler.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The background radiation is the product of particle interactions   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What particles? What interactions? What shape does your theory predict the  <br>
spectrum of to have, that of a radiating blackbody as observed? What    <br>
temperature does your theory predict this blackbody radiation to have?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>          &gt;and also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
You could argue about cause but there is absolutely no doubt that the <br>
redshift is real and almost no doubt that its magnitude is proportional to <br>
the distance an object is from Earth. If it is caused by the Doppler shift <br>
then it must be due to the general expansion of the entire universe, if not  <br>
then the Earth would have to be in a privileged position, the center of the <br>
universe. I doubt it. <br>
<p>
Yes, the redshift could be caused by some mysterious force unknown to science, <br>
but we shouldn't invoke new physics if we don't need to and we don't need to. <br>
Besides, nobody has been able to flesh out this mysterious force into a <br>
testable scientific theory so The Big Bang has no real  competition.<br>
