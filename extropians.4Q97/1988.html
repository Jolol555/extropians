I hear that.<br>
<p>
Some have suggested better filters. I just reviewed my all the posts I<br>
could get to on the archive; I was expecting to pay money for a<br>
subscription to a high-Q list.<br>
<p>
You get what you pay for?<br>
<p>
Whatever, I've given it a year and it's not working; no significant changes<br>
in the SSNR are likely to occur; none of the suggested plans for improving<br>
it have been implemented.<br>
<p>
Be well. See you on the Funway.<br>
