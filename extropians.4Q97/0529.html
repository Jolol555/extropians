Whoa!  Microsoft, there, is trading at 60 times earnings.  20 is considered<br>
rich.  And Microsoft officials keep warning everyone that next year's earnings<br>
will not rise as sharply.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, this bull market is a bubble if I ever saw one.  People are<br>
buying a stock in expectation that it will rise, rather than in expectation of<br>
receiving dividends.  The only way to make money on this stock market is if<br>
someone else pays an equal amount of money.  In short, it's a pyramid scheme,<br>
not an investment strategy.<br>
<p>
Microsoft is in a somewhat better position than most.  Because it gives large<br>
stock options to its employees, Microsoft actually benefits from the money you<br>
spend on its stock, so you are, in a sense, "investing" in it.<br>
<p>
But in my opinion, you shouldn't "invest" in stock unless the corporation<br>
gets your money, such as in an Initial Public Offering.  Otherwise, you are<br>
gambling either that the pyramid scheme can continue indefinitely,<br>
or that you can pull out before it collapses.  If you want your wealth to<br>
generate wealth, you have to actually give it to someone who can use it... not<br>
buy pieces of paper and hope you can sell them for more than you paid.<br>
<p>
It's a pity Zyvex (nanocorp) doesn't take small investors.<br>
