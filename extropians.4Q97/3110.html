You're right, our current "justice" system is based on equality, that's why <br>
it produces very little justice. A virtue is something that should be <br>
maximized and that's why equality is not a virtue, unlike knowledge or <br>
intelligence or happiness or justice you can have too much equality.<br>

Now why would you want to say a silly thing like that? Equal justice for all <br>
is a terrible idea because then justice would become a public good and nobody <br>
would get much of it. A public good is something  beneficial that because of <br>
it's nature must be provided to the entire public or it can't be provided at <br>
all. Universal clean air and water are 2 examples of a public good and we <br>
don't have universal clean air or water. A good law is also a public good and <br>
that is exactly why good laws are as rare as hen's teeth when government <br>
makes the laws. A true public good is impossible to produce in quantity under <br>
any system. Justice is no different than anything else, if you want to <br>
maximize it, make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. A good car <br>
is not a public good, it's a private good, even if everybody doesn't have one, <br>
even if I'm the only one on earth who has one, it's still a good car. The way <br>
society is currently set up, private law is not allowed so a good law is <br>
always a public good, everybody must obey exactly the same good law. That's <br>
why there are so many more good cars than good laws. This also explains why <br>
governments don't legislate themselves out of existence, doing so would be a <br>
public good.              <br>
