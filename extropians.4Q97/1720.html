<i>&gt; wired-in that structure is. </i><br>
<p>
We both claim to understand one another, but I still feel I'm utterly<br>
failing to get my point across.  Lojban, in order to be parsed by a<br>
linguistically-capable human mind, must have nouns and verbs.  It DOESN'T<br>
MATTER that Lojbanist's don't call them that; these categories are, as you<br>
admit, a wired-in structure.  They're simply a part of how language works.<br>
It doesn't matter that Lojban's creators don't make phonological<br>
distinctions between noun and verb forms, or that you can use the word<br>
for "blue" as a noun or as a verb or as an adjective; all those parts of<br>
speech are how the pieces of information are relayed and relate to one<br>
another.  Read on.<br>
<p>
 It may well be that I and<br>
<i>&gt; other Lojban speakers also internally make that mapping</i><br>
<i>&gt; when we produce sentences; but that is a function of how</i><br>
<i>&gt; our brains are wired, not something that actually exists</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the language itself.</i><br>
<p>
All I'm trying to say is, if you parse a string of phonemes in a way that<br>
corresponds to a verb in a natural language, it's a verb.  Period.  I've<br>
read everything that the Lojban site offers, and I still see nothing that<br>
distinguishes its not-verbs from verbs.  Give me some examples of<br>
predicates that don't correspond to a verb phrase (confusingly labeld "the<br>
predicate" in syntax) and I'll do my best to understand how they're not<br>
verbs.<br>
<p>
 Many other verbs--even<br>
<i>&gt; those that express very non-verb-like things like spatial</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationships, properties, associations, etc., are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; expressed in a verb-like way (or else escape doing so by</i><br>
<i>&gt; using the copula): "I belong to this group" (as if that</i><br>
<i>&gt; were an action I'm taking, not a state of existence),</i><br>
<i>&gt; "This document supercedes that one" (as if the documents</i><br>
<i>&gt; were actor and acted upon), "I married Jane" (not referring</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the ceremony but the state), "Stones surround the fire"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (as if it were their choice). </i><br>
<p>
Ah, I start to see the problem.  Being a verb doesn't have anything to do<br>
with volition, intention, motion, or time.  This is the fault of those<br>
damned lies we're taught in elementary school. "A noun is a person, place,<br>
thing, or idea.  A verb is an action."  As I've written many times now, a<br>
verb is something that acts verby.  Well, if we agree that "belong,"<br>
"resemble," "surround," etc., are verbs in English and other natural<br>
languages but don't demonstrate "action" in the sense of movement,<br>
intention, etc., what does that leave?  The relationship between<br>
"actors."  And that, philes, is all verbs are.<br>
<p>
BTW, it may be that verbs for abstractions, mental states, and<br>
relationships have the same form as normal things we think of as verbs<br>
(run, kiss, walk, excoriate) because language evolved primarily to<br>
communicate social information and was later expanded to communicate other<br>
things (hunting, gathering, where to find water, how far away the nearest<br>
cave is) by metaphorically extending intension, etc., to non-social<br>
topics.  In other words, the groundwork was already there for showing<br>
action and relationship ("Hey Grok, you won't believe what Zog just did!<br>
Ook found her giving berries to Lop from the clan on the other side of the<br>
valley!"); these algorithms were expanded by using the same patterns for<br>
describing things outside of the social world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So while I agree that verbness may very well be built into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way our brains work, I'm not ready to give up on a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea just yet, because I /can/ see the difference, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think humans (if not me, then maybe my children or a later</i><br>
<i>&gt; enhanced me) will be able to use this structure as easily as</i><br>
<i>&gt; I use verbs.  I'm not yet convinced that this isn't possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I think it's important because language is by far the</i><br>
<i>&gt; single most important technology we have, and optimizing it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is likely to produce great benefit.</i><br>
<p>
I've never been convinced there's anything wrong with language.  I can't<br>
even remember the last time anyone said anything I found ambiguous because<br>
of the structure.  It's been my experience that people have to work <br>
to come up with a string that _anyone_ would find ambiguous.  Let's see...<br>
"The man wrote the letter on train."  Now, this _could_ mean that Mr<br>
Vandal took some paint and wrote the letter "Q" on the side of a<br>
locomotive, but that meaning would be made clear by the context.<br>
<p>
"A man in a trainyard thought about the letter Q.  He wrote the letter on<br>
a train."<br>
<p>
"After leaving Shanghai, the traveler thought about her brother and<br>
decided to write him. She wrote the letter on a train."<br>
<p>
Real speech isn't an assortment of bizarre propositions made in isolation.<br>
Context, context context!<br>
<p>
There's plenty of ambiguity around, but that has more to do with foggy<br>
thinking than the words those thoughts are framed in.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I can imagine some ways that language could be better.<br>
For example, it would be very useful to be able to follow three or four<br>
discourses at once; say, hearing two people talking at the same time while<br>
reading two braille books, or to be able to produce several streams at<br>
the same time.<br>
