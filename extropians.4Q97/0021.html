<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well considering she used the thought experiment of an "indestructible<br>
robot" in her ethics, people in glass houses, y'know?  'Likely' has<br>
nothing to do with it.  I agree that ethics is for everyday life, but<br>
what these thought experiments bring out is the deepest presuppositions<br>
in that everyday ethics. Testing to destruction, you might say.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, what do *you* think about the change of metaphor?  It sure seems<br>
less intuitively obvious that the woman has initiated coercion, than<br>
when you think of some curmudgeon fencing in a bit of sod, doesn't it?<br>
<p>
I suppose what I'm getting at is, why would somebody feel the need to<br>
fence in and say "this is mine, fuck off", unless there was some danger<br>
of people rudely coming and interfering with whatever he was doing with<br>
it, without so much as a by-your-leave.  The point of the rule of<br>
property is not that it is a defence by the owner, but a forbearance by<br>
everyone else - it gives bite to the notion of freedom by creating a<br>
'clearing' for everyone within which it is possible to *be* free.<br>
