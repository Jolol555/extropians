'Star Wars' Artifacts at Mythic Museum Show<br>
<p>
 3:02pm··31.Oct.97.PST -- WASHINGTON - Twenty years ago, in multiplexes <br>
not too far away, Star Wars made a name and a fortune for George Lucas. <br>
Today, artifacts from the films are in a national museum, where <br>
organizers bracing for a blockbuster. <br>
<p>
"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth," a 5,000-square-foot exhibit featuring <br>
costumes, characters, models and artwork from the film trilogy, opened <br>
today at the National Air and Space Museum for a one-year run. <br>
<p>
 The crush is expected to be ferocious for the run of the show, and <br>
museum officials stressed that tickets are required, even though <br>
admission is free. The draw is so powerful that more than 300 volunteers <br>
already have signed up for crowd control at the hangar-sized museum on <br>
Washington's Mall. <br>
<p>
A similar exhibit, "The Art of Star Wars," was held two-and-a-half years <br>
ago at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. <br>
<p>
Lucas, who envisioned the trilogy and plans six more films as part of <br>
the saga, said he hopes the exhibit will "inspire young people who are <br>
interested in art, science, and computer technology to use their skills <br>
and imagination to create new worlds and pursue their dreams." <br>
<p>
The more fanciful characters from the first movie - the giant, hairy <br>
Chewbacca, the rolling computer R2-D2, the effete chrome-bodied droid <br>
C-3PO, the loathsome Jabba the Hutt, and the heavy-breathing Darth Vadar <br>
- are part of the new exhibit, as are some of the vehicles and models, <br>
which are set near a display of real space technology from the US-Soviet <br>
space race. <br>
<p>
Lucas is comfortable with this juxtaposition. "A lot of the great <br>
scientists and adventurers and pioneers were inspired by works of <br>
fiction," he said at a breakfast with reporters this week. "The line <br>
between make-believe space fantasy and real space fantasy is very <br>
thin.... This [actual space exploration] is the more exciting side ... <br>
even though kids don't realize it." <br>
<p>
Lucas said he has finished shooting the first of three films that are <br>
set 20 years prior to the first three movies. This film will be released <br>
in 1999 after 18 months of post-production work and animation. He also <br>
plans a final trio of movies, set long after the first Star Wars films. <br>
<p>
 Lucas avidly follows space exploration efforts, and believes that <br>
extraterrestrial life will be found in this galaxy, probably on another <br>
planet's moon. <br>
<p>
"Obviously, it's going to be a microbe but it's a significant step," he <br>
said. "I don't think our aloneness is as significant as people once <br>
thought."  <br>
<p>
