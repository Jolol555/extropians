Position Specification<br>
Perspecta<br>
Linguistics Engineer<br>
<p>
<p>
While the Internet has revolutionized the availability of information,<br>
navigating these vast resources and finding relevant information<br>
remains a major problem.  Perspecta's products will provide users with<br>
a radical new way to turn increasingly overwhelming amounts of<br>
information into a manageable , usable, and valuable resource.<br>
<p>
The Founding of Perspecta Perspecta was founded in January 1996 by<br>
Earl Rennison, Lisa Strausfeld, and Nicolas Saint-Arnaud, alumni of<br>
the MIT Media Lab, and technology industry leaders Steve Holtzman and<br>
Nicholas Negroponte.<br>
<p>
Prior to founding Perspecta, the founders developed revolutionary new<br>
ways of representing and navigating through large volumes of<br>
information through their work in the Visible Language Workshop at the<br>
Media Lab.  Through their work, Rennison and Strausfeld painted a<br>
visionary picture of the future of information organization and<br>
navigation with their Galaxy of News, Financial Viewpoints, and The<br>
Millennium Project which received worldwide recognition, won<br>
international awards, and provided the foundation for other research<br>
projects, both in and out of the Media Lab.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Boston to Silicon Valley</i><br>
<p>
In 1994, the MIT students met Steve Holtzman, a computer industry<br>
veteran from Silicon Valley whose recently published book, Digital<br>
Mantras, had received critical acclaim as a philosophy of creativity<br>
for the digital age.  The book resonated with many people at the Media<br>
Lab as it reinforced the notion that new methods and paradigms were<br>
required to unleash the potential of digital expression.  Upon<br>
completing their research at the Media Lab, Earl, Lisa, and Nicolas<br>
approached Holtzman and Nicholas Negroponte, the founder and director<br>
of the Media Lab, to explore how they might establish a company to<br>
commercialize their ideas.  Together, they founded Perspecta in<br>
January 1996, with initial seed funding provided by Holtzman and<br>
Negroponte.  The company moved to San Francisco and began the process<br>
of building a team to deliver its first products.<br>
<p>
Now with eighteen employees and venture-funding from Applied<br>
Technology, Sofinnova, and Informix Software, Perspecta is well on its<br>
way to implementing commercial software products that will<br>
dramatically enhance the way people navigate and experience<br>
information on the Web and corporate intranets.<br>
<p>

Francisco with 18 employees.  Major investors in Perspecta include<br>
venture partners Applied Technology and Sifinnova, and corporate<br>
