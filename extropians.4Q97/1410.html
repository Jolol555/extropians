<i>&gt; Date:          Thu, 13 Nov 1997 10:12:16 -0800</i><br>
<i>&gt; From:          Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Harvey Newstrom, &lt;harv@gate.net&gt;, writes:</i><br>
 &lt;SNIP&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Certainly a physical copy would not be enough.  But things are different</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you are talking about an exact mental copy.  It can be argued that</i><br>
<i>&gt; identity is fundamentally a matter of patterns of processing.  Reproduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pattern, and you reproduce the identity.</i><br>
<p>
But then we run into a problem of differentiating copies. <br>
<p>
&lt;more SNIPed&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of them?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; am curious to find out why I am not thinking the way other people are. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Maybe it is my own experience with my own copy (twin) that makes me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; skeptical of this approach?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's possible that your twin is making you focus too closely on genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; and physical similarity, which is really not the issue.  There is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; enormous difference between someone who looks something like you and</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone whose brain is running exactly the same program as yours.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly the same to what degree?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here are two arguments which make the pattern theory of identity more</i><br>
<i>&gt; plausible.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;yet more...:)&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Putting these together, you could imagine stopping your run on one computer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and later resuming it on a different computer.  You would not perceive any</i><br>
<i>&gt; break in your train of thought or have any reason to believe that you had</i><br>
<i>&gt; died.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, this is effectively the same as starting up a copy of your mind while</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroying the original.  It appears that this actually does preserve</i><br>
<i>&gt; identity, at least in the case of uploads, and there is no reason why it</i><br>
<i>&gt; should not do so for organic brains as well - it's just more difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrange in that case.</i><br>
<p>
I still see a difference between stopping and starting the *same* <br>
program (which is held in memory until restart), and starting <br>
*another* program while stopping the first permanently.  We often <br>
think of two copies of a program as being 'the same' when in fact <br>
they have features that differ (location, frex).  But we only do this <br>
because we *don't care* if the program or data we are using is <br>
identical, as long as it is close enough that it works.  A self-aware <br>
program would probably care.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Another argument is to consider the case of a world where copying like</i><br>
<i>&gt; you describe is easy and commonly used as a means of transportation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone has copies "on ice" on many different planets, and when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to travel elsewhere they transmit a copy of their brain state, get</i><br>
<i>&gt; that programmed into the brain of the copy, which then wakes up as them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (This is similar to what is done in Linda Nagata's "The Bohr Maker".)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Imagine yourself someone who has participated in this form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transportation many times over the course of his life.  He has memories</i><br>
<i>&gt; of having lived in each of these various bodies for a time, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; transferring his consciousness to a different one, while the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; body was destroyed (or at least its memory erased for future use).</i><br>
<p>
I would say that such a person has participated only once. :)  The <br>
fact that he has memories which are taken from previous people <br>
doesn't mean that he *is* those people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From his point of view, these transformations preserved his consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sense of self just as much as going to sleep at night and waking</i><br>
<i>&gt; up in the morning.  He felt just the same, behaved the same, remembered</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything he had done before the transfer.  There is no reason for him</i><br>
<i>&gt; to view it as death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This would be the natural point of view of anyone who had tried it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few times.  So it would seem that actually experiencing the kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfer that you are afraid of leads to reassurance that it does preserve</i><br>
<i>&gt; your sense of self, and there is no reason to fear it as death.</i><br>
<p>
Assuming that someone who may exist in the future will think that <br>
they are me doesn't really help me accept the idea that *I* should be <br>
killed after the copy is made. <br>
