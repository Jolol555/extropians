<i>&gt; 	I think this forum is an excellent one to discuss the violence</i><br>

<i>&gt; the future.  I don't think we can pursue our extropic ideas for long </i><br>
<i>&gt; without doing much to solve the violence problem.  We need to consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; why humans are violent.  From there, we can discuss ways of  effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterring violent behavior.  I think discussing the violence problem will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be more interesting and more productive than  discussing the issue of who</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be allowed to possess firearms.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely. As I see it, it can be divided into two main<br>
problems: one is how to decrease the amount of violence in general,<br>
and the other is how less-violent groups should deal with violent<br>
groups.<br>
<p>
Violence is an expression of aggression, and deeply ingrained in our<br>
mental structure. This suggests that we cannot easily get rid of it<br>
without some clever re-structuring of out brains (not something we are<br>
likely to be able to do within close future), although it can likely<br>
be controlled by setting up good mental safeguards (which are of<br>
course fallible, given sufficient irritation) during maturation. The<br>
big question is how to do this well (without stopping other,<br>
beneficial behaviors or limiting defense ability), and how to spread<br>
useful controls among people who have dysfunctional controls.<br>
<p>
The second problem seems to be a variant of the Prisoners dilemma:<br>
mutual defection is much less valuable than mutual cooperation, but a<br>
defector can exploit cooperators. Axelrod's results suggest that the<br>
non-violent group should adopt a "nice" strategy (no first strike), be<br>
forgiving (do not try to punish competitors too much), provocable<br>
(respond immediately to aggression), avoid envy (focus on increasing<br>
their own absolute fitness rather than their relative fitness compared<br>
to competitors) and be clear (make sure others can interpret their<br>
actions).<br>
<p>
On a game theory website I also found the suggestion of attempting to<br>
change the rules so that one avoids getting caught in a prisoners<br>
dilemma. This might occur by becoming immune to attack in some way,<br>
for example by being essential for the defectors or moving out to a<br>
different niche (place); do we have any better meta-strategies?<br>
