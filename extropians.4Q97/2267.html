 (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;know. Braking distance is about 100 meters, visibility about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same. Someone on the backseat claims that there is an obstacle</i><br>
<i>&gt;ahead but can't tell whether it's something solid or just a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt;thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge,</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever...) and the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's</i><br>
<i>&gt;not going to slow down because some backseater 'thinks' he sees</i><br>
<i>&gt;something. So here we are rushing toward an object that could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall of concrete. After</i><br>
<i>&gt;some discussion the still unclear object is now to close</i><br>
<i>&gt;for a full stop, the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens' or the ask the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is'</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the lowest speed possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize</i><br>
<i>&gt;the damage (if any).</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm.... not a problem for the 1999 Synergy Hypercar, since it's<br>
forward looking collision avoidance radar will alert/brake you in<br>
case of any imminent danger. Besides, it's composite monocoque<br>
chassis/passive restraint system is years ahead of anything<br>
manufactured just two years ago. Not only that, but since each<br>
wheel/hub is an individual electric motor/generator (used for<br>
regenerative braking) the stopping distance is much less.<br>
<p>
 The Kyocera turbine/generator set in this baby runs at peak<br>
efficency, and combined with the features above means I get an<br>
average equivilent of 200 Mpg ( I like to use ethanol). This<br>
greatly reduces the other problem you mentioned in your post.<br>
<p>
Okay, I'm indulging in a little near future speculation, but<br>
everything I've mentioned does exist, it's an ongoing project of<br>
the Rocky Mountain Institute.<br>
