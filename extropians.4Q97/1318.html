Discover Magazine.  "Surreal Numbers."  Forget which issue.<br>

Yep.  Surreal numbers are denoted by up and down arrows.  An up arrow with<br>
a dot on top means go up omega times (omega being the set of all integers)<br>
Surreal numbers are used to distinguish from different types of<br>
infinities.  For example, the number of integers is obviously different<br>
than the number of real numbers, yet we call them both infinity.<br>
<p>
I think I'll find the article and read it again. <br>
