Dear Tom, Max, fellow Extropians &amp; Transhumanists of the World, Consious<br>
Entities in all Dimensions,<br>
<p>
Recently there has been some discussion about the name of the (still<br>
unofficial - non-registered) Dutch Transhumanist Society "Excedo". Henri<br>
Kluytmans, founding member, came up with this name several months ago and<br>
we all agreed that it was right for us. Strickly speaking it's Latin but<br>
Dutch people (most of whom have a reasonable command of English) would<br>
associate it with words like 'Exceed' and 'Excel'. It also sound like<br>
something fast and dynamic. We felt (and feel) this name would nicely<br>
represent our &gt;H idea's about the great possibilities we see in the (near)<br>
future.<br>
<p>
I want to be complete and try to show the entire discussion, my apologies<br>
for the length of this post. This post should in no way be seen as an<br>
attack on Tom personally, he has gone trough a lot of trouble for us and we<br>
do appreciate all the attention he has given this issue, even if we do not<br>
fully agree with him.  I am posting this because we want everybody involved<br>
to know what is happening, possibly there's someone out there with a<br>
brilliant idea that will solve this.<br>
<p>
A few weeks ago Berrie, who has been working very hard on laying the<br>
groundwork for a well-organized Dutch &gt;H Ssociety, started an E-mail<br>
correspondance with Tom about our name. Tom was worried that there might be<br>
confusion between the Extropy Institute and Excedo because of the name.<br>
<p>
 ------------------ Tom's first mention of the Problem ----------------------<br>
<i> &gt;Berrie,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I'm always excited to see somebody new take up an interest in disseminating</i><br>
<i> &gt;transhumanist and extropian ideas, and look forward to your success in</i><br>
<i> &gt;spreading the good word.  Before you go much further with your project,</i><br>
<i> &gt;however, I'd like to ask if you might consider some alternatives to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;name "Excedo".</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;ExI uses the "ex" prefix in a variety of ways: in its name "Extropy</i><br>
<i> &gt;Inst."; its magazine "Extropy"; its newsletter "Exponent"; its conference </i><br>
<i> &gt;"Extro"; and so forth. Since you plan to cover many of the same topics as </i><br>
<i> &gt;ExI, and to give them must the same interpretation, "Excedo" will most </i><br>
<i> &gt;likely confuse people. "Is that another ExI project?" they will ask. Or, </i><br>
<i> &gt;worse yet, they will just *assume* that ExI deserves the credit for your </i><br>
<i> &gt;hard work.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Furthermore, if your project succeeds and flourishes, ExI may well want to</i><br>
<i> &gt;do some joint projects with you. But confusingly similar names would force</i><br>
<i> &gt;us instead to keep our distance, so that people would not mix us up even</i><br>
more.<br>
<i> &gt;It would be a shame to lose a potential friend for such a little reason.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Do you see why it would be better for both your work and ours if you chose</i><br>
<i> &gt;a more distinctive title? Let's work together to try and find a better name</i><br>
<i> &gt;now, so we can avoid problems once you get more established. I'm pretty</i><br>
<i> &gt;good a coining words and would be glad to help. I'm ccing Max on this, too, </i><br>
<i> &gt;so he may have some ideas.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Upward!</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Tom</i><br>
<i> &gt;---------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
So a discussion started between Excedo members and Tom about alternatives.<br>
Various Latin/Greek combinations were considered (see matrix at bottom) but<br>
in the end "Excedo" seemed to be just right for us. Berrie wrote to Tom and<br>
Max:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Hello Tom &amp; Max,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;After discussing a long time and searching for a new name, we</i><br>
<i> &gt;still feel that Excedo is the best name.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;It has speed and all Dutch people associate it with to exceed, excel</i><br>
<i> &gt;an improve. Which is exactly what we want to say. In Latin it </i><br>
<i> &gt;means to improve and excel, so unless we find a very good alternative</i><br>
<i> &gt;we all really would like to keep this one.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Still, we don't want to start a "fight" over this, before we even have</i><br>
<i> &gt;started to get to know each other. So, please note that we are still</i><br>
<i> &gt;open for every suggestion you have.</i><br>
<i> &gt;On the other hand, we do have a lot in common, and this name is telling</i><br>
<i> &gt;it. Personally I don't mind at all that we also have "Ex" in front of</i><br>
<i> &gt;it. It shows that we are somehow related.</i><br>
<i> &gt;BTW: what's your relation with Excelsior regarding this ?</i><br>
<i> &gt;Also: we have a different style, which shows (IMHO) that we are our</i><br>
<i> &gt;own organization. Long live the diversity :-)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Other then this, we are waiting to go "live" with the site, and make</i><br>
<i> &gt;public statements. The only reason why we didn't go ahead already</i><br>
<i> &gt;is because of the fact that we might change the name.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Anyway let us know what you think.</i><br>
<i> &gt;We are working on the same goal, so there is no doubt in my mind</i><br>
<i> &gt;that we will work it out.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Greetings,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Berrie</i><br>
<i> &gt;----------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
To Which Tom responded:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Berrie,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Thanks for the update.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I really do think it would be a big mistake for you to use "Excedo," and I</i><br>
<i> &gt;plead for you to reconsider before going further. While I understand why</i><br>
<i> &gt;you think that name fits you, I think you underestimate the harms that will</i><br>
<i> &gt;come from people confusing you with ExI. Even you admit that:</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;  we do have a lot in common, and this name is telling it.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Yes, we will be doing common things. That is *exactly* why the common use</i><br>
<i> &gt;of "ExI" will confuse people! They will assume that we have more in common</i><br>
<i> &gt;than we do--namely, a common organization. Take it from a fellow who has</i><br>
<i> &gt;handled these sorts of problems for *years*--it takes much less than the</i><br>
<i> &gt;common "Ex-" mark to confuse the public, which never pays great attention </i><br>
<i> &gt;in the first place.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;To be sure, using "Ex-" might benefit you at the start of your project. It</i><br>
<i> &gt;would allow you to free-ride on all the positive associations that we have</i><br>
<i> &gt;built into our mark over the years. But can't you see how it is unfair to</i><br>
<i> &gt;ExI for you to risk confusing the public about our work, after we have</i><br>
<i> &gt;worked so long and so hard to create a strong and positive name for </i><br>
<i> &gt;ourselves? </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I really do not understand how people who profess sympathy with ExI would</i><br>
<i> &gt;so willingly set out to harm it. There must be some sort of terrible</i><br>
<i> &gt;misunderstanding, here. Perhaps in my urge to strike a friendly note, I</i><br>
<i> &gt;have not stated my concerns with enough force. Let me now be absolutely </i><br>
<i> &gt;clear: I cannot regard you as a friend of ExI, Berrie, if you willingly try</i><br>
<i> &gt;to free-ride on ExI's use of the "Ex-" mark and confuse our public about our</i><br>
<i> &gt;work.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I want us to cooperate, and to launch a long friendship, but I *must*</i><br>
<i> &gt;defend ExI's interests first and foremost. Please, *please* reconsider now</i><br>
<i> &gt;before it is too late.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;  BTW: what's your relation with Excelsior regarding this ?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I'm do not know of what you speak, here.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Tom</i><br>
<i> &gt;---------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
Now we're scratching our heads:<br>
Homo Excelsior is a European Transhumanist organisation/magazine that has<br>
been around for quite some time, Our own Anders Sandberg is Vice-Chief<br>
Editor. Why is their name no threat to the Extropy Institute we wonder? And<br>
why has Tom only voiced his doubts about it now? "Excedo" was mentioned<br>
several times over the last several months on the list?<br>
<p>
We all thought this was a bit strange, especially when you comparing the<br>
first mail by Tom with this later one. In the first mail he seems to be<br>
worried that we won't get credit for our activities and later he 'accuses'<br>
us (well, that's how it reads to us anyway) of trying to 'take a free ride'<br>
on the good name of ExI.<br>
<p>
Point is: ExI is not (yet) a 'household' name in Europe, certainly not in<br>
Holland. We've been talking to al *lot* of people and no-one had ever heard<br>
of the 'Extropy Institute'. Therefore (and no offence intended here)<br>
there's not much 'free ride' to take at this moment. Transhumanism is just<br>
awakening on this side of the Atlantic and we'd like to help make it<br>
happen, knowing that it will be an uphill struggle.<br>
<p>
Berrie, who has been working with heart and soul on this project and who<br>
was the one most in favour of changing Excedo's name to something else if<br>
this was good for transatlantic relations, took this quite personal:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Tom,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I will forward it to all the others</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; cannot regard you as a friend of ExI, Berrie, if you willingly try to</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; free-ride on ExI's use of the "Ex-" mark and confuse our public about</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; our work.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;This hurts,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;to asume that we really had the intention to "free ride" on your</i><br>
<i> &gt;account. I'm a very postive guy, else I would even consider it</i><br>
<i> &gt;as very arrogant to think that an organisation like yours</i><br>
<i> &gt;can allready claim such a thing as EX.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Please re read this, if you think it's to harsh......</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;stupid me, I thought I could contribute to a new movement,</i><br>
<i> &gt;I didn't realize enhough it's allready so big !!!</i><br>
<i> &gt;Forgive me, and send new instuctions........</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; I want us to cooperate, and to launch a long friendship, but I *must*</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; defend ExI's interests first and foremost.  Please, *please* reconsider</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; now before it is too late.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I will !!!! AND I"M F**KING HONEST !!</i><br>
<i> &gt;sorry, this mail of you came at the wrong time.</i><br>
<i> &gt;I invested Months and Months, to build a structure, </i><br>
<i> &gt;togheter with all my friends....</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;"free ride"  tssss..........</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;  BTW: what's your relation with Excelsior regarding this ?</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; I'm do not know of what you speak, here.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Humo excelsior, they are on the web.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I really hope we can get a clear sky on this ASAP :-)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Berrie</i><br>
<i> &gt;----------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
He immediatly wrote another mail to explain his outburst:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Tom,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I feel I need to add something.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;We chose this name before our "relation"</i><br>
<i> &gt;with Extropy. We chose it HONEST and</i><br>
<i> &gt;with no idea in our mind to use it as a free ride.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Fact: you are the first who mentioned this !</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;So, we all feel.....how shall I put it.</i><br>
<i> &gt;That you have to come up with a new name for us !?</i><br>
<i> &gt;I hope you read this as intended !</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;We/I think we gave our name a lot of thought</i><br>
<i> &gt;and we had good reasons for choosing it.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;However, we realize we are the new ones here,</i><br>
<i> &gt;so we are open for every suggestion you have.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Also, we do give all of you a lot off credit for</i><br>
<i> &gt;actually building the first structure related to </i><br>
<i> &gt;extropy/transhumanism.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Never the less, In holland/europe etc.....I doubt</i><br>
<i> &gt;there are more then 100 people who have heard from</i><br>
<i> &gt;you. Correct me if I'm wrong.</i><br>
<i> &gt;So I think it's fair to say, that we too deserve some</i><br>
<i> &gt;credit for taking up the task of spreading the</i><br>
<i> &gt;positive meme and we try to contribute in our own</i><br>
<i> &gt;way. </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Anyway, It would be nice to have some deadline</i><br>
<i> &gt;on this name thing. And get it over with.</i><br>
<i> &gt;We tried very hard to come up with a better !!</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Anyway, I'll get some sleep first. I also hope</i><br>
<i> &gt;you read the mails as intended.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Positive, open, constructive and HONEST.......</i><br>
<i> &gt;Since, I can't forsee how you read them, I feel</i><br>
<i> &gt;I should mention this.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Ironicly, I am the one who is trying to</i><br>
<i> &gt;convince the others to change it. :-)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Hope this put a lot of things in the right</i><br>
<i> &gt;perspective !</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Greetings,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Berrie</i><br>
<i> &gt;--------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
Tom responded yesterday evening (CET) in a very constructive way (We're<br>
very happy about that).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Berrie,</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I appreciate your good will, and I take you at your word that you intend no</i><br>
<i> &gt;harm to ExI. But I have a duty to ExI to protect its interests, and it has</i><br>
<i> &gt;almost no assets but for its good name. I thus have to make sure that, for</i><br>
<i> &gt;*whatever* reason, people do not decrease the distinctiveness of "ExI",</i><br>
<i> &gt;"Extropy", "Exponent", "Extro", and so forth.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;We have in the past had *severe* problems with people using our trademarks</i><br>
<i> &gt;in ways that would confuse the public and, in some cases, convey very</i><br>
negative<br>
<i> &gt;impressions. You sound like you have some good work in mind, I'll grant,</i><br>
<i> &gt;but to the extent that more and more people use "Ex-" related names in the</i><br>
<i> &gt;same context as our work, we get less and less leverage over the *really*</i><br>
<i> &gt;problematic cases.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I have tried again and again to help you find a new and fitting name. That</i><br>
<i> &gt;is far more than I have done in the past in similar situations, but you</i><br>
<i> &gt;strike me as a genuinely sincere and nice fellow. So, I'll continue trying</i><br>
<i> &gt;to help if I can, and invite you to suggest what I can do. But I certainly</i><br>
<i> &gt;do not regard it as my duty to find you another name. It is quite clear</i><br>
<i> &gt;that we started using "ex-" names first and that you deliberately adopted</i><br>
<i> &gt;"Excedo" to show some sort of relation to our work. OK, I'm flattered. But</i><br>
<i> &gt;I would prefer that we find some other way (say, actual content of your </i><br>
<i> &gt;ideas and references in your publications to ExI) to show that relation.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I should mention that, as an alternative, we could establish a more formal</i><br>
<i> &gt;relationship via a license. This would not have to be anything formal, but</i><br>
<i> &gt;Max would want to weigh in. Personally, I do not prefer this option, but I</i><br>
<i> &gt;offer it for your consideration.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;You have no doubt thought things through so far as your interest goes, but</i><br>
<i> &gt;let me just add a point that you may have missed: I'm not sure it shows</i><br>
<i> &gt;very much creativity and independent thinking to adopt a name that sounds so</i><br>
<i> &gt;similar to what someone else has used. Isn't taking a radically new</i><br>
<i> &gt;approach to old issues part of your program? A more distinctive name</i><br>
would, I<br>
<i> &gt;think, better support your claim to innovation.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I'll have to look into "Homo Excelsior", but if it always uses those two</i><br>
<i> &gt;words together, it poses much less of a problem for us than "Excelsior"</i><br>
<i> &gt;alone would. (Perhaps that suggests a solution for our problem!)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Tom</i><br>
<i> &gt;-----------------------------------------------</i><br>
<p>
The last paragraph may be the solution to all this, we're thinking and and<br>
all ideas are welcome.<br>
<p>
It is important at this point to state clearly that we did not, repeat<br>
_not_, choose Excedo in relation to Extropy. We chose it in relation to<br>
Transhumanism. That's why no one of us came up with the possible<br>
missunderstanding between Extropy and Excedo. Again: there's no good name<br>
to 'take a free ride on' or to damage because, save a few, no-one has ever<br>
heard of ExI in the Netherlands and most of Europe (Americans should<br>
appreciate that Europe is lagging several years when it comes to the<br>
widespread use of E-mail and the WWW).<br>
<p>
Becoming a part of of ExI is not a practical option for us at this time<br>
because some of the Libertarian views expressed on the ExI-site would lead<br>
to great PR-problems for us given the Dutch social-political arena. To make<br>
a difference we have to be a part of society, not a fringe group. This<br>
aside from the fact that they may conflict with some of our personal opinions.<br>
<p>
This entire discussion could, of course, be very bad for the longterm<br>
relationship between our embryonic organisation and ExI and we don't want<br>
that. We want to be partners with ExI, work together, learn and make our<br>
contributions to the prolifiration of &gt;H memes. We realize that we're just<br>
starting and would be honoured to be a 'younger brother' to ExI, but not a<br>
little child that needs to be told how to behave. Mutual respect must be<br>
the basis of any relationship.<br>
<p>
It would be a great loss of opportunity not to connect the globally<br>
dispersed drops of awakening Tranhumanism and create an ocean of ideas<br>
(From Tom's mails I understand you already have a small lake ;-). We truly<br>
want to work together with *all* transhumanist organisations around the<br>
world, emphasizing the many values and goals we share. No-one will benefit<br>
from dispersed splintergroups who squibble over what they should call<br>
themselves and each other. We share so much, let's make that the basis of<br>
our relationship.<br>
