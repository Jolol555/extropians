But our language *has* suffered as much phonetic diversity as Chinese.  It's<br>
just that the dialects as close to ours as Mandarin is to Cantonese or Wu are<br>
called Dutch, German, and Swiss-German.  Voice is more satisfying and faster,<br>
especially if you have to signal ideograms; people just restrict their<br>
calling to those who they can speak to.  That's no more onerous for a<br>
Cantonese speaker than a Dutch one.  <br>
