<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The thing is I HAVE been providing proof, but yall still wont accept it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Such as, the reeds of the crop circles are changed in the chromosones, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  many of them are also bent at the nodes (which is impossible to do if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tried).  Thats biology and vision at work.  Also, the water-powered cars,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  guy gave directions on how to make them!  If you dont believe him make it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  yourself and see.  I cant think of the other stuff ive written but they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  legit, like the sacred geometry site, they're using mathematics for what</i><br>
<i>&gt;  they're doing.  You're right, yall are dealing with conventional stuff, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  there is a mystery to the world that you're just blowing off.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Stating that something is so is not proof. Posession and display of<br>
evidence that has been established as holding up under scientific<br>
scrutiny is proof.<br>
<p>
I can just as easily give you "proof" that neither of those that you<br>
claim is true. There have been several individuals and groups who have<br>
come froward admitting to being involved in creating the crop circles.<br>
<p>
The claim of plans for a water powered car is not proof. What would be<br>
proof is chemical reaction equations showing exactly what is claimed to<br>
be going on. Instead there are "secret ingredients" etc.. If sacred<br>
geometry were true as seen on the site you posted, then the equations<br>
would hold up under scrutiny. They don't. I've seen the same thing with<br>
a guy by the name of Cathie, from NZ who wrote a book about the earth's<br>
harmonics as an explaination of the energy sources of ufos, etc. I<br>
freind of mine went on and on about this guy, until he showed me the<br>
book with all of its fancy equations, which I promptly showed were not<br>
mathematically valid.<br>
<p>
Much of the claimed "mystery" to the world is usually caused by<br>
hypnotism, self delusion, hallucination, fraud, and slight of hand. The<br>
rest can and/or will be explained by science. Granted there are some<br>
true mysteries out there: 1) why do Saturn's rings remain stable? How<br>
does ball lightning work? Why after all the scandals, do Bill Clintons<br>
approval ratings remain so high?<br>
<p>
There is NOTHING in this universe that cannot be explained by science.<br>
