&lt;&lt;Lee Daniel Crocker's comment&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If he thinks he can master this subject in a few years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; he's simply living in a dream-world, and will believe anything.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There's no need to insult the man -- he's certainly living no more in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a world of his own devising than are most of us.  And if you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; he'll "believe anything", I'm not sure you're reading the same posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; of his that I am.</i><br>
<p>
      It's necessary to awaken him from a stupor wheby he sleep-walks into <br>
      catastrophe.  The memes of 'poisonous pedagogy' can terminate his <br>
      life.  More to the point, if he cares about values, he'll want to <br>
      preserve and protect them (unless he's so isolated that he sees the <br>
      world entirely in terms of his own survival, in which case he's <br>
      cognitively badly crippled, and needs our assistance.  For his own <br>
      good...  &gt;:-} ). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe he doesn't intend to have children of his own.  In any case, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I imagine that if he does have them, he won't torture them -- at </i><br>
<i>&gt; least not on purpose.</i><br>
<p>
      As you might guess, my concern is with the impact on them, not <br>
      his intentions, however 'good.'   <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [ FX: "Oh, that's all right, then..." ]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I consider that my own hyper-rational upbringing was a torture of its </i><br>
<i>&gt; own kind, that manifests itself occasionally in intellectual bludgeoning</i><br>
<p>
      This sounds most interesting.  What form did this upbringing take?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I think I temper it with politeness and other concessions to people's </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional sides, which Lee seems to eschew -- which explains a lot).</i><br>
<p>
      You mean, you're a kinda _svelte_ killer?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      A different kind of Combat Masterpiece?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Enough for now.</i><br>
