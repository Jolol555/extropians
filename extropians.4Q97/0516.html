Let me reiterate that I'm not positing /hard/ or unbreakable =<br>
constraints<br>
on future entities or technologies.=A0 They may exist.=A0 They may =<br>
not.=A0 No<br>
one is in a position to say definitively.<br>
<p>
In my observation of the world, though, I note that the rate of<br>
advancement of /technology/ often far eclipses the rate of advancement<br>
of /theory/.=A0 Technology grows at an amazing rate for some time, till =<br>
it<br>
approaches the boundaries of our theoretical models of the world.=A0 At<br>
that point its rate of growth slows.=A0 Eventually new theoretical =<br>
models<br>
are put forth that facilitate a new round of amazing technological<br>
growth.=A0 Thus advancement of theory becomes a /bottleneck/ on the<br>
advancement of technology.=A0<br>
<p>
That being the case, let me rephrase the question of the thread<br>
somewhat.=A0=A0 What are the most significant theoretical bottlenecks =<br>
that<br>
we're approaching?=A0 How far can we get before hitting those<br>
bottlenecks?=A0<br>
<p>
(I'm an adherent of the philosophy of asking questions for a purpose, =<br>
so<br>
let me explain this one:=A0 These theoretical bottlenecks present =<br>
likely<br>
targets for our research and contemplation.=A0 Knowing how far off they<br>
are helps us prioritize our allocation of resources to the various<br>
areas.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky [SMTP:sentience@pobox.com]</i><br>
<i>&gt; What about negative matter?=A0 You can have an arbitrary amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; material in a given volume, with net mass zero.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting.=A0 I'm not familiar with negative matter, any =<br>
recommendations<br>
on a primer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given the likely mass, age, and size of the universe, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; constraints listed above, what is the maximum achievable</i><br>
computational<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; power of the universe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Infinite.=A0 There exist physical processes which are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulable-to-arbitrary-accuracy by Turing machines.=A0 Even if all</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes *are* simulable, they still use real numbers.=A0 Perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt; clever</i><br>
<i>&gt; Being could exploit a chaotic Mandelbrot-like boundary to perform</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations</i><br>
<i>&gt; of arbitrary complexity in constant time.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm.=A0 Not sure I agree with your premise.=A0 It seems that to really<br>
exploit this you run up against Planck space/time again, and what you<br>
really get is Quantum Computing.=A0 Which, while it provides truly<br>
mind-boggling computational power for certain classes of problems,<br>
certainly does not provide infinite computing power.<br>
<p>
This is what I mean by a theoretical bottleneck.=A0 Perhaps some future<br>
model of the fundamentals of space/time/matter/energy will provide us a<br>
way to manipulate physical processes of arbitrary complexity in =<br>
constant<br>
volume.=A0 However, our current models do not.=A0<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given c, the age, size, and rate of expansion of the universe, how</i><br>
<i>&gt; long</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would it take an earth-spawned power to infest the galaxy?=A0 =</i><br>
1/10e6<br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the universe?=A0 1% of the universe?=A0 10% of the universe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; General relativity makes the speed of light fundamentally arbitrary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They can</i><br>
<i>&gt; infest the entire Universe in zero time, and finish before they</i><br>
started.<br>
<p>
This is totally at odds with my understanding of GR.=A0 Relative to an<br>
observer anywhere else in the universe, c is a very real constraint.=A0<br>
Certainly relative to the action here on earth (or whatever starting<br>
ground the power has), c appears to be quite a real constraint.=A0 =<br>
Please<br>
explain.<br>
