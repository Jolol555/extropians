<i>&gt; OK, Then, so far, including myself, I've counted four gun owners just in</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses to the original post, and including Anton. We can do a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; census right here. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All subscribers to the list, please respond as to whether you own a gun.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, privacy rights would allow anyone to not respond, for fear of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being labelled a gun toting nut by the more politically sensitive here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or if their local jurisdiction puts a crimp on the subscriber publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt; acknowledging ownership (a human rights violation if ever I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; one). You may also contact me privately by email if you wish.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I'm a gun owner. <br>
I was rather surprised by the vehemence of the reaction from some here on<br>
the list. Ah well, tis the sad truth that not everyone will agree with you in <br>
this world. :-)<br>
I think my reasons for having the weapons I do are pretty reasonable. I don't<br>
foresee getting any others. I think the reasons I have them are somewhat <br>
instructive in this discussion.<br>
<p>
The three I have are:<br>
<p>
A shotgun, that I keep because it's the only thing I have that belonged to <br>
my paternal grandfather who died in an auto wreck shortly after I was born.<br>
<p>
A Russian Tokarev pistol that was brought back from World War 2 by my father<br>
(a medic) after he won it playing chess against an SS Major while the war was <br>
still going on. (Now there's a treasured family story for you. :-)<br>
(I'd not like to give up either of them. Too much sentiment value for me.)<br>
<p>
The last one would come perhaps closest to being "reprehensible" in the eyes<br>
of some here.<br>
<p>
A 25 auto, that I got while I was in the army. I was a radioteletype operator<br>
and as such worked in a metal radio shack on the back of a pickup truck. <br>
There was just too little space for the M16 I was issued to be useable there,<br>
either if someone yanked open the door, or if I had to abandon the shelter in<br>
a hurry and had no time to fumble with the weapons rack for the rifle on the <br>
way out. (My opinion still is that a 45 or 9mm would be a more appropriate<br>
weapon to issue for that job). I wanted something I could easily conceal in <br>
a pocket or some such, and would give me a small chance in a bad situation.<br>
I was stationed with front line infantry and artillery battalions then, and <br>
was in Korea when both the KAL shootdown, and much more ominously, the <br>
bombing by North Korean agents that killed several members of the South Korean<br>
cabinet (1983-1984) on a diplomatic visit by Chun Doo Hwan to Rangoon. We<br>
(the people with me in the 2nd Infantry Division) were very worried that <br>
war was iminent. The ROK military fully deployed to the border, and the <br>
sentiment among much of the Korean government was to strike. Thankfully, it<br>
didn't happen. Not only were there US forces in the south, but Russian advisors<br>
stationed with the forces in the north, so it would have immediately involved<br>
forces from two superpowers. Scary.<br>
So that purchase wasn't motivated by paranoia IMHO. But a considerable <br>
concern for my own life in a war.<br>
<p>
The only thing I've done with them for years is to check on them once a <br>
year or so to renew the coat of oil on them.<br>
Now I agree, there's no real reason of utility (at least any more) for having<br>
even one of them, let alone all three. But I have them, and they'll likely stay<br>
locked up where they are. The chances of them getting stolen are quite small,<br>
and I've never been arrested (and to my feeble recollection not been in a fight<br>
since the 8th grade or so), so I don't rate them a major hazard to me or <br>
society. The high voltage power supplies, and lasers I work with when doing <br>
research are much more of a threat to my safety. Though I try to be careful, <br>
and haven't been in an accident since I was 23 (12 years), I'm sure driving <br>
my car is a far greater threat to my neighbors than they are.<br>
I don't think that makes me some sort of gun wacko, tho I'll be happy to<br>
entertain comment otherwise. If the laws were changed to make having them<br>
illegal, I'd likely give them up, or send them to a member of the family<br>
that lived somewhere they weren't illegal. (As to whether I think the gummint<br>
would be right in doing that is immaterial. I'll use legal means in my disputes<br>
with it, thank you.)<br>
I will conceed that I have in the past known a gun owner that scared the <br>
living daylights out of me (A former Earth First type who then joined up with<br>
the NRA, and was working on a PhD in physics. Go figure). But I'd rate that <br>
was a problem with the man, not the guns per se. <br>
