<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This has been my experience with Microsoft products.  I am currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to build web pages that are standard HTML and compatible with</i><br>
<i>&gt; every browser.  I downloaded Microsoft Internet Explorer to my Macintosh</i><br>
<i>&gt; and installed it.  In the "README.TXT" file it explained that it changed</i><br>
<i>&gt; the data format of my "Internet Config" control panel, which is used by</i><br>
<i>&gt; all TCP/IP programs on my Mac.  It them explained that other programs</i><br>
<i>&gt; may not be compatible with the "newer" version.  Basically, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; reformatted another product's data files in such a way to make it</i><br>
<i>&gt; MS-compatible only, and broke it for other products.</i><br>
<p>
What do you mean "another products data files"? DO you mean that it made<br>
IE the default browser for .html files for that computer? Duh, thats<br>
merely a matter of file format association. It happens with any<br>
application installation, they'll try to hog as many compatible file<br>
formats for themselves and screw existing apps on the system that might<br>
be more useful with those file formats. Microsoft is not alone in this,<br>
its a standard industry practice. Corel did it when I installed Ventura<br>
to .rtf and .doc files, Graphics COnverter Gold did it to ALL graphic<br>
formats (as does HiJaak Graphics Suite).<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another example just occurred at IBM where I work, also involving</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft and Web Pages.  The Microsoft servers wouldn't feed graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt; correctly to Netscape browsers.  They claimed that the Netscape browser</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't view the file, but that Internet Explorer can.  Upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; investigation, it turns out that the files are readable by Netscape, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Microsoft Server refuses to serve to Netscape clients.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of our engineers tried to retaliate by making his webserver refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; to serve to Microsoft Internet Explorer, we discovered that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft browser will misrepresent itself to gain access.  It first</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims to be Microsoft Internet Explorer.  If access is denied, it then</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims to be Netscape Mozilla to gain access.</i><br>
<p>
Here's an idea. Netscape could, GASP, do the same thing, impersonate an<br>
Explorer browser to gain access to a MS webserver.... Gee why didn't I<br>
think of that... I dunno, it must be because I don't work for<br>
microsoft.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There also are many examples of Microsoft products opening back doors on</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines to allow their servers to gain access, or for their anti-piracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; software to check for stolen products on your machine.  Some of these I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have discovered will open listening sockets on the network, even when</i><br>
<i>&gt; networking appears to be disabled and all access permissions are denied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This latter example occurred with a wordprocessor program on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "non-networked" machine that was causing network problems for other</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines.  There was no way to open a document file without the machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; turning on the network and communicating data about the local machine to</i><br>
<i>&gt; other Microsoft products on the network.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to see more about this. Any system administrator would find<br>
this a useful tool, and this data must be how many of the network<br>
oversight applications operate. A good way to make sure your coders and<br>
data entry weenies are working and not playing solitaire or sending each<br>
other joke email....I'm sure my boss would like to have that capability<br>
over me... he he...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a Network Security consultant, I recommend that my clients do not use</i><br>
<i>&gt; products that deliberately sabatage other products, lie to security</i><br>
<i>&gt; filters to gain access to other machines, or open back doors to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network that are neither documented or part of the product's normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; function.</i><br>

As a network consultant, I recommend that others in the field find out<br>
more about how PCs work in background operations to expand their<br>
horizons past their Mac blindered knowledge...<br>
