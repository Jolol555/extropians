<i>&gt; &gt; Danny is apparently referring to a tetrahedron, not a triangle or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pyramid. Using a rough Earth radius of just under 4000 mi. (3957 mi. on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; average, as the radius at the equator is slightly greater than at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; poles due to centrifugal stresses), and a rough moon radius of 1080</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; miles, a tetrahedron made to fit exactly inside the earth (within a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; couple dozen miles or so), would need a moon with a radius equal to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1333.333.... mi., so our moon is a couple hundred miles too small. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anyone can call me on the numbers please do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since the Earth is/has been expnding, that would mean that perhaps in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past the relationship was accurate (given that the moon has been the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; size since then, seeing how its solid cold, it appears that way), I wonder</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the date of that was.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if we were to erroneously assume that the moon is the same size it<br>
always was, and that the earth has expanded due to accumulated<br>
meteoroidal material, then we would need to have accumulated material to<br>
be 750 miles deep over the entire surface. This comes out to an<br>
accumulation rate on average of one tenth of an ince every decade. Since<br>
total new soil generation on earth averages  one inch per 30,000 years,<br>
coming from all sources, including erosion of existing rock, I find this<br>
figure highly specious.<br>
<p>
Since we know that the moon has accumulated material at a far faster<br>
rate than the earth, due to its higher angular velocity allowing it to<br>
sweep through more space than the earth while taking advantage of the<br>
earth's greater gravity well as an attractor of material, we can<br>
conclude that the only time in earth's history that the moon may fit<br>
into a tetrahedron large enough to fit inside the earth, is sometime far<br>
into the future, so long as the sun doesn't go nova first.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; If these numbers are right, this is a good example, Danny, of how</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; "sacred geometry" is bogus because they use bogus math, the don't do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; their homework. I suggest that you do yours so you don't get hoodwinked</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; by this sort of stuff.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; -- &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, sacred geometry uses correct numbers, true sacred geometry.  Why would</i><br>
<i>&gt; they use wrong numbers/equations?  I was referring to a picture at a web</i><br>
<i>&gt; site, thats all, they obviously just did it to look cool, i wanted to know if</i><br>
<i>&gt; it was a correct relationship.</i><br>
<p>
I missed all of the links you provided. COuld you repost them so that I<br>
could inspect the sites you speak of. I expect that once I do I can come<br>
back to you with more examples of their lack of scientific rigor.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is not to say that all such relationships are bogus. I have a gut</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;feeling that Bode's law may have an underlying cause based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mechanics of the original solar accretion disk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you mean the disk that formed the planets?  What is Bode's law?  I feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same way,  I also believe there's a lot going on in saturn's rings, given</i><br>
<i>&gt; the braided rings, and god knows what else.  Oh, there's also high voltage</i><br>
<i>&gt; bursts emanating from saturn that is synchronistic with a specific place on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ring.</i><br>
<p>
Its entirely probable that given a star of a certain size with a given<br>
amount of disc material of a given size posessing a given amount of<br>
angular momentum that the approximate positions and sizes of planetary<br>
bodies that form can be accurately predicted. Unfortunately, until we<br>
get a chance to visit other star systems, any such theories at present<br>
are merely theories without sufficient supporting evidence.<br>
