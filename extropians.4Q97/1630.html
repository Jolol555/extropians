LS!<br>
<p>
We need your help in finding a good name. <br>
Something in Latin (or Ancient Greek perhaps).<br>
Something that will be clear to the public.<br>
Something that will be easy to remember.<br>
Something great like Extropy or Excedo (but different).<br>
Something that will stand the test of time!<br>
     (at least until the Singularity)<br>
<p>
Think of something wonderful and:<br>
                                W I N ! <br>
    a $100 gift certificate for Amazon, the world's greates bookstore!<br>
<p>
We'd love to hear your suggestion. During the next 14 days all are free to<br>
post suggestions to the list. We will choose a name after consulting with<br>
Tom, Max and anybody who wants to get involved.<br>
The person that comes up with the brillaint idea that will rid us of this<br>
problem will be awarded with a $100 electronic giftcertificate that can be<br>
used to purchase books at www.amazon.com, the worlds greatest bookstore.<br>
<p>
We are looking forward to your ideas!<br>
<p>
On behalf of Excedo, the Dutch Transhumanist Society,<br>
Warm Regards,<br>
Arjen<br>
