Okay, so this is a little late.  <br>

Linguistics in the transformational-generative tradition is trying to make<br>
a theory which explains the hows and whats of natural language.  The<br>
Lojban program is doing something analogous to engineers trying to build a<br>
hyperspace drive while ignoring quantuum and relativity theory.  I'm not<br>
that current theories in linguistics are as satisfactory as those two in<br>
physics, but the point is you need to have some idea of the territory<br>
before you try to landscape it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The acid test for Lojban would be, can children learn it and not creolize</i><br>

<p>
That depends on what they do with it.  Chances are, they will creolize it.<br>
Creoles conform in every way to UG after taking a pidgin as a starting<br>
point, as do every other language with native speakers.  This includes<br>
the languages of Australian Aborigines and New Guineau highlands, who<br>
were separated from the rest of the world's peoples for about 40,000<br>
years.  That kind of universality says a lot about the accuracy of UG. <br>
If Chomsky &amp; pals are right and a human language must, by definition,<br>
conform to UG, children raised with Lojban will not turn it into anything<br>
particularly interesting.<br>
<p>
 Far from being a failure of the<br>
<i>&gt; Loglan project, it would be a great success (though it would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; failure of the language itself, perhaps).  It is precisely because Lojban</i><br>
<i>&gt; is so alien to the way things are done in evolved languages that makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; it a useful data point.  I also think it would be a useul language--</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps not as a primary, but as a secondary one.  Both of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; conjectures are subject to experiment.  I participate in the latter;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll have to wait until I have children to participate in the former.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think Lojban is alien to the way languages handle things but to<br>
the way people express their thoughts.  Language didn't appear for the<br>
purpose of expressing propositional logic, and most people don't think in<br>
terms of hairsplitting logical distinctions.  If we want to make the<br>
logical implications of our thoughts explicit, we can do so within the<br>
confines of natural language.  The point is, why bother?  Teaching someone<br>
a created language is not the simplest way of getting them to think<br>
critically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My only argument with Chomsky is that he is treated as a God by much</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the linguistics world.  Specifically, his dismissal of the Sapir-</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whorf hypothesis is taken as if it had been discredited, when it fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing of the kind has taken place. </i><br>
<p>
As many people hate Chomsky's guts as follow research in his wake; what<br>
can you say, he made it into a real science and not something<br>
anthropologists and philologists did in their spare time.  I really don't<br>
see anyone as treating him like a god; he just made a lot of work possible<br>
that other social scientists had ruled out due to logical positivism.<br>
<p>
 Many experiments have failed to<br>
<i>&gt; show strong effects, and many /have/ show weaker effects--clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; showing, for example, that language can affect cognition even to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; point of perception.  These phenomena go largely unexplored today</i><br>
<i>&gt; because Chomsky followers don't think they'll amount to anything, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is a great loss.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there have been shown to be very, very weak effects of language on<br>
thought, mostly unconscious and unimportant.  For example, English<br>
speakers need to explicitly say whether they learned something directly or<br>
by hearsay; Navajo (IIRC) does this automatically, but doesn't specify<br>
time. <br>
<p>
As for perceptual effects, I can only assume you refer to studies on how<br>
the visible spectrum is named.   Every language on Earth breaks up colors<br>
into, at the very least "light" or "white" and "dark" or "black."<br>
Thereafter is a distinct hierarchy of color names.  If a third color is<br>
distinguished, it is always red.  Four colors adds green, yellow, or blue,<br>
depending on how you ask.  Five colors includes a second of those three,<br>
and so on.  And there is a hierarchy of implication: if a language has a<br>
word for "brown" or "grey," it has the basics in the Crayola 8-pack.<br>
<p>
Does this mean that speakers of different languages see different colors?<br>
Of course not, as tests with chips tinted in colors not distinguised by<br>
the testees' language show.  People everywhere see the same colors; we all<br>
have the same eyes and it seems improbable that language, however powerful<br>
a system it may be, can reach down and rewire the retina.  We see the same<br>
spectrum; where the distinctions are drawn are different, but not<br>
unimaginably so.  Furthermore, even if, say, Hopi lacks the vocabulary to<br>
talk about, say, libertarianism, speakers are very good at making new<br>
words to express new ideas, either by compounds, abreviations, acronyms,<br>
borrowing, or other such devices.<br>
<p>
So you're right, linguistic determinism is dismissed by mainstream<br>
linguistics except in a very weak form which surprises nobody anyway.<br>
And until somebody demonstrates that the conceptual systems of some pair<br>
of languages are different to the point where they CAN'T be translated<br>
into each other, nobody will take Whorf seriously.  His writings certainly<br>
aren't impressive, and all his examples (e.g., the Hopi and their "utterly<br>
different" view of time) were wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Phonology is a tricky area; we hear phonological distinctions that aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there in the accoustics. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly my earlier point about the SWH: ask anyone here if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually /hear/ word breaks in spoken English.  Most people will</i><br>
<i>&gt; unquestioningly say "yes, of course".  You and I both know that</i><br>
<i>&gt; those breaks don't exist in the acoustics, so their perception is</i><br>
<i>&gt; being influenced by their learned language. </i><br>
<p>
This has nothing to do with linguistic determinism.  "Hearing the breaks,"<br>
i.e., distinguishing words, is completely a result of the interference of<br>
literacy, as studies with non-literate peoples and pre-literate children<br>
have shown.  Spaces between words were, AFAIK, a European innovation of<br>
the medieval period; classical Mediterranean and Indian texts do not show<br>
breaks between words.  Literacy interferes with a lot of things, such as<br>
getting people to make phonological distinctions.  Ask someone to say a<br>
word backwards; chances are, they'll pronounce the _spelling_ backwards.<br>
"Sink" [singk] --&gt; "k'niss." <br>
<p>
 These effects deserve<br>
<i>&gt; more study.  For example, would a child who grew up with Lojban</i><br>
<i>&gt; phonetics "hear" word breaks where Lojban makes them optional</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which is almost everywhere)?  </i><br>
<p>
Again, that's strictly a matter of orthographic fashion.  <br>
<p>
Would two children who grew up<br>
<i>&gt; speaking Lojban to each other over email, but with two different</i><br>
<i>&gt; native languages, end up using the same intonations, or might they</i><br>
<i>&gt; even use Lojban text in different ways?</i><br>
<p>
Not particularly interesting.  Compare the spoken English of a German and<br>
a Russian who use English to communicate by email; or any other<br>
international language, such as Russian used in the former soviet<br>
republics.  More than this, there is study in the emergence of "world<br>
Englishes" --the standard English of regions using English as a 2nd<br>
language, such as Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and many other Commonwealth nations.<br>
It doesn't particularly matter whence a language comes "originally"; local<br>
environment prevails, asside from the leveling effect provided by<br>
communication between regions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The existence of a language like Lojban makes it possible to &gt; study</i><br>
questions like this in a way that would really not be &gt; possible any other<br>
way.  Even if the language /as a language/ &gt; is deeply flawed--and it may<br>
well be, though I haven't found &gt; so yet--it is still a great contribution<br>
to the science. <br>
<p>
It's an interesting project, but unless the research is carried out with<br>
an understanding of contemporary theories in mainstream linguistics, it's<br>
simply not going to go anywhere.  Furthermore, there's a long history of<br>
new, improved languages that utterly failed to catch on.  Esperanto,<br>
anyone?  There's no need for something like Lojban when natural languages<br>
have so much more communicative possibilities in terms of vocabulary and<br>
literary heritage.  To create an auxilliary language with as great<br>
expressive ability as any real language would require an unimaginable<br>
amount of work.<br>
