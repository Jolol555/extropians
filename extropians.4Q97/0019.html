In a message dated 97-10-01 10:45:54 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Yes I read it ! maybe I just missed that part, I'll read it again<br>
 But I was referring to the "actual" start-up, like Anders Sandberg<br>
 took it. So you just "wake-up"? I thought there had to be a "pulse"<br>
 from outside, something like what they do, when someone's hart<br>
 has stopped ( a bit like flatliners, or so )<br>

I heard an interview with a guy from Alcor and he said that they dont know<br>
how they would reanimate, that they would have to develop the technology in<br>
