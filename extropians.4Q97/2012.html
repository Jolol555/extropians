Personally I think one of the issues is that, given the increase of interest in<br>
extropy, the idea of single list for an international community is outdated.<br>
Perhaps the communication in the ExI could be better distributed by separate<br>
lists for different topics.  Also, an emphasis on local gatherings outside of<br>
California and other forms of networking might help.  I for one would like to<br>
hear from extropians and transhumanists in the Chicago area.<br>
