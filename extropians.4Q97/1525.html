<i>&gt; reserves, as they are not now. Oddly enough, as market prices rise, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of decades of reserves available INCREASES.</i><br>
<p>
And all this does is move "eventually" farther out.<br>
<p>
If we continue (into the indefinite future) to use fossil fuels -- <br>
even if we eliminate all fuel uses and simply continue to use them at <br>
the current rate as a raw material for synthetics -- we WILL <br>
eventually run out of fossil fuels.  Including the oil shales you <br>
refer to.<br>
<p>
That's probably several hundred years of "eventually".  But it will <br>
still happen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only real excuse to not use fossil fuels is because of global</i><br>
<i>&gt; warming, if it really exists.</i><br>
<p>
I am pretty well convinced that it's very real -- and I'm very glad.<br>
<p>
Eliminate the likely effects of human pollution (and don't be <br>
short-sighted, we aren't NEARLY as polluting today as we were a <br>
hundred years ago, and possibly not even two hundred years ago, at <br>
least not in the ways that matter most), and you're talking ice age.<br>
<p>
If we can boost the temperature another three to five degrees, the <br>
climactic change might restore the Sahara Prairie -- which would make <br>
life a lot easier for a lot of poor people.<br>
<p>
Shorelines?  TWO degrees warmer, we're back to the temperature of <br>
about a thousand years ago.  Do we have lots of evidence of sea <br>
levels dropping since then?  We should have good records from China, <br>
and maybe Japan, and Arabia... the Maldives were a major cultural <br>
center a thousand years ago, and they are a bunch of pretty low <br>
islands, so their records should be really informative... and who <br>
knows, even Europe might have something, in spite of the Dark Ages.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And unless someone in the meantime finds it worthwhile to put a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; effort into tuning external-combustion engines (what we should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; done in the first place), the "something" that will most likely be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; done is finding a way to make gasoline from some other raw material.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps hemp oil or soybean oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; external combustion? you mean a fireplace powered car???? ;)</i><br>
<p>
No.  Think steam engines.  Given the same level of technology and <br>
development, an external combustion engine has *vast* advantages over <br>
internal combustion.  It's easier to switch fuels.  Since it burns <br>
steady (rather than in bursts) it burns the same fuel more cleanly <br>
and efficiently.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately there HAS NOT BEEN the same level of development.  <br>
We've put many times more effort into internal combustion engines.  <br>
Today we do not know how to make an external-combustion engine <br>
suitable for use in an automobile, that is nearly as good as the <br>
Rankine-cycle internal combustion engines that the automakers use by <br>
the millions.<br>
<p>
I've read about some interesting schemes.  For example, a hybrid <br>
vehicle using some sort of energy storage device; the charging <br>
mechanism is a standard IC engine (about the size of a <br>
riding-lawnmower engine) which runs intermittently but at a set, <br>
constant speed when running.  This addresses some, but not all, of <br>
the inherent relative disadvantages of the internal-combustion <br>
engine.  Since it's properly tuned for its actual operating speed, it <br>
runs cleaner than a normal IC engine and with less wear -- but still <br>
inferior to what should be expected of a similarly-developed steam <br>
engine, if such an engine existed.<br>
