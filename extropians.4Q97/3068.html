The reason why we have had a list rule against debating "the basics" is<br>
so that we could share in a common set of assumptions and spend our time<br>
exploring the ramifications and possible extensions of those assumptions.<br>
<p>
It would be useful to consider the basic libertarian assumption of<br>
non-coercive interactions as part of this basic set.  I realize that<br>
this is not perfectly well defined, that people will differ about<br>
what constitutes coercion, and the circumstances in which consent is<br>
legitimate.  There are also classic hard cases like life threatening<br>
situations where even libertarians may disagree about whether coercion<br>
might be justified.<br>
<p>
Even with all those problems, there is still a core of an idea which we<br>
can adopt and share.  It is in keeping with extropian ideals of individual<br>
responsibility and maximum personal authority.  To the extent that we can<br>
structure our relationships on a voluntary, non-coercive basis, we are<br>
all that much freer.<br>
<p>
As it is, we spend far too much time and effort debating issues where<br>
the real question is whether one group can force another person or group<br>
to stop what they are doing even when it does not harm anyone else.<br>
Sometimes this is not even clearly perceived to be the issue, and the<br>
parties end up talking past each other.  If we could just say, "this<br>
proposal violates the principle of non-coercion and so is best debated<br>
elsewhere", that would allow us to focus our energies on constructive<br>
and cooperative discourse.<br>
<p>
I also see that questions are being answered with knee-jerk libertarian<br>
responses which fail to address the real issue.  The issue of infectious<br>
disease arises.  People see it as a threat of coercion, that they may be<br>
prevented from going about their business.  So they respond negatively and<br>
try to avoid the issue.  The issue of social conventions arises.  Again<br>
there is an implicit threat of coercion if you don't fit the social norms.<br>
So people respond with their knee-jerk attitude that there should not be<br>
social conventions.<br>
<p>
These responses ignore the real world where the laws of nature are such<br>
that people inevitably interact in unplanned ways.  Externalities surround<br>
us.  My visit to the grocery store causes me to inhale your cigarette<br>
smoke, while you get to listen to my booming car stereo.  Until we have<br>
better control over our environment (such as perfect virtual reality)<br>
these kinds of interations will continue to be an important part of<br>
our life.<br>
<p>
Yes, we want to live in a world without coercion.  Let us agree on that.<br>
We can even grant that all property is private and that whatever rules<br>
are in force in a location are those determined by its owner.  Now "the<br>
market will decide" what rules are appropriate in each venue.  This is<br>
all old hat, or it should be.  But it still tells us exactly nothing<br>
about what those rules will be, what we would prefer them to be.<br>
<p>
I suggested a mechanism earlier to approach consideration of these<br>
questions without this knee-jerk response of anti-coercion.  Suppose you<br>
have a choice of "worlds" to go to (I suggested space stations, but in<br>
a more realistic context it could be alternative grocery stores with<br>
different policies).  Which would you prefer?  What set of conventions<br>
for unplanned interactions do you think would be most pleasant?<br>
<p>
Ideally there will be no point nor any need for knee-jerk libertarianism<br>
on this list.  People can have the libertarian debate elsewhere.  There is<br>
no shortage of places where the fundamental issue of the legitimacy of<br>
coercion can be discussed.  There is even a saying that all debates are<br>
really the libertarian debate: an exaggeration, but still with a germ<br>
of truth.  Certainly most of our "basic" disagreements have revolved<br>
around this issue.<br>
<p>
Let's move on and try not to keep getting bogged down on this question.<br>
