But in the cases where they are good advice, would you say it would <br>
be moral?<br>
<p>
Let's take the idea to its extreme. Suppose there is some perverse <br>
type whose deepest values are of a sadistic nature. Suppose this guy <br>
is king in some small country in the third world. According to your <br>
ethics, would it be moral for him to coerce his subjects into serving <br>
him and helping him torture as many children as possible? From what <br>
you have said so far, it looks as if it would be a consequence of <br>
your view that it would be *morally wrong* for this king *not* to <br>
commit these atrocities, given that they indeed reflect his deepest <br>
values.<br>
