I don't agree with you at all, I hardly think the constant barrage<br>
of illegal gun usage in the media constitutes an "Idea", and<br>
"Idea's" are banned all the time. Let's just incorporate it into<br>
the so called "Safe Harbor" ruling that confines erotica to hours<br>
between 10pm and 6am. Now it's not banned, "just confined to<br>
reasonable hours."<br>
<p>
Besides with over 20,000 gun laws in this country, which in my<br>
opinion is quite an effective ban, whats wrong with one little law<br>
striking at the source.<br>
<p>
By the way, it would be trivial for the government to stop this in<br>
the mass media, (TV and Movies). Some cable companies as well as TV<br>
stations already have voluntary anti-gun policies.<br>
<p>
What it might do is put an end to "Hollywood Hippocricy" i.e.<br>
Sylvester Stallones conscientious objector status during the<br>
vietnam war only to make million's playing a big gun shooting war<br>
hero later.<br>
