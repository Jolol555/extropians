Why does the economy grow?  Why do some places and times grow<br>
faster than others?  The relevance to such questions to <br>
topics frequently discussed on this list should be obvious.<br>
<p>
There is a large economic literature on economic growth, and <br>
I can assure you that those who contribute to this literature<br>
understand a lot of important things about growth.  I urge<br>
anyone who really wants to speculate well on the future<br>
to understand this literature.<br>
<p>
I can't say I understand it that well, but I've been reading a<br>
bit the last day or so.  Here's some interesting tidbits:<br>
<p>
-- Total growth is mainly due to improved productivity via diffusion<br>
of lots of little insights in societies where innovation is accepted.  <br>
Scale effects, via standardization, size of markets, etc., are crucial.<br>
The capital/labor share of improved productivity is about 50/50.<br>
-- Per capita growth rates between nations have been highly divergent; <br>
The lower nation that catches up to the higher nation is the <br>
exception; typically the higher pulls away.  The lowest nations now<br>
are about as low (in per capital income) as all nations were once.  <br>
-- Since 1870, US growth rates have been roughly constant.  <br>
-- Britain took off initially most likely due to strong social <br>
controls on birth rates, free markets, and a strong culture of <br>
hobby science.  Even then the takeoff was very slow.<br>
-- American then took over because of additionally having a<br>
combination of natural resources and a large integrated market.<br>
British capital was invested in the U.S.<br>
-- The soviets grew fast at first, via huge capital influxes from<br>
high (forced) savings, but this was understandably a one-time effect.<br>
-- Depending on the technology of the time, human vs. other capital <br>
were complements or substitutes.  When newly complements, those <br>
higher skilled got extra wages, increasing the income gap, <br>
and education shot up.  Computers favor complementarity.<br>
-- Most of the recent Asian growth has been due to high capital<br>
inputs, rather than productivity growth.  High capital came from <br>
high savings due to a demographic change, then capital came from abroad.<br>
