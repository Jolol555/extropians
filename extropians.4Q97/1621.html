CNN (11/20/97):<br>
<p>
   In the year 2014[?], Social <br>
   Security will start paying <br>
   out more than it takes in. <br>
<p>
Rather than saying SSI will be on a endless <br>
slide into bankruptcy, CNN's wording serves <br>
not to signal SSI doom but serves as a sol-<br>
icitation for more funding. Then they inter-<br>
viewed half-a-dozen people singing praises <br>
of SSI... an institution of human dignity.<br>
I guess bankruptcy is the path to glory.<br>
<p>
There is a universal one-to-one correlation <br>
with what the federal gov't wants and what <br>
CNN et al dish out to the American people. <br>
Why bother nationalizing the mass media?<br>
<p>
Serfs were in debt slavery. As the cost of<br>
gov't "benefits" begin to exceed the ability<br>
of The People to pay for them, the people <br>
will become serfs... by definition. This<br>
is the path that's being prepared.<br>
<p>
Our only hope is that technological advance <br>
and access can outpace the growth of gov't<br>
with its ever-growing "collective debt."<br>
