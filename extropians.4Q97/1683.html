<p>
I know, BUT octopi are already very smart without neotony AND initially,<br>
short development cycles might be better.  We can make changes and<br>
get results quickly in the early phases of the project.  This would speed<br>
up progress for later phases.  (I am assuming technology in this area will<br>
remain roughly as is.  I make this conservative assessment because I<br>
want the experiment to happen -- not remain an armchair speculation.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I agree, but do not want to get bogged down in a we-must-have-them-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; talking-English-with-a-Brooklyn-accent-or-we've-failed attitude.  Also,</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; upgrading one ability feeds into the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I never said we needed *human* language.</i><br>
<p>
I was engaging in hyperbole to underline my point -- not to attack yours.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If we could make the octopi communicate better with skin color, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be a great step.</i><br>
<p>
Which sounds like the route to take, since Octopi alread appear to use<br>
color displays for expressive purposes -- in mating and territoriality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that if different individuals can communicate, then they can also</i><br>
<i>&gt;learn more from each other and we get more help in the uplift process</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the uplifted species itself, since it will begin to expand its</i><br>
<i>&gt;memetic niche.</i><br>
<p>
An obvious point, but nonetheless one that should be kept in mind.<br>
And, of course, this means, hopefully, interspecies communication.<br>
<p>
We should collect data on octopus development and genetics.  We<br>
should also design tests to measure intelligence so that we can<br>
monitor progress.  There should not only be many tests, but they<br>
should progressively get more elaborate..  It would be ineffecient<br>
to spend years developing octopi which were not sentient but<br>
merely good at passing some simple test.  We would learn<br>
something, but at high cost -- part of the cost being what we<br>
could have learned.<br>
<p>
I would like to set up some scenarios and preliminaries for the<br>
above.  Any takers?  We will need minds and money.  Hopefully<br>
enough of the former will mean less of the later is needed.<br>
<p>
Also, because I am not a moral relativist, I would also like to<br>
hear anyone who believes this is wrong or isn't sure speak<br>
up.<br>
