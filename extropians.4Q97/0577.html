(Hey, now I can say I've seen an address error.  Second attempt.)<br>
<p>
quoth Wesley Schwein (whose name I haven't noticed before;<br>
welcome, if applicable):<br>
<p>
: Some languages (especially creoles such as the various Caribbean<br>
: languages, Swahili, und so weiter) rely entirely on intonation to<br>
: indicate a question (ie, a question that doesn't require a wh-<br>
: word); there is no change of word order.<br>
<p>
No particle, either?  (must retrieve my Swahili book from its box)<br>
<p>
:  All intonation languages allow this feature,<br>
: including English.  "You have a new car."  "You have a new car?"<br>
: I couldn't say how tone languages or pitch accent languages (like ancient<br>
: Greek or Sanskrit or modern Swedish or Japanese) handle this.  Anders?<br>
<p>
Japanese has a particle: every question, even wh-, ends in _ka_.<br>
<p>
: Loan word use is a cultural trait, not a linguistic one in itself;<br>
: some use of loan words is inevitable when one language is in contact<br>
: with a number of other languages, but loans as extensive as we find in<br>
: English may represent a lack of linguistic chauvinism.  It is equally<br>
: possible to get by entirely without loan words, using only neologisms from<br>
: morphemes already found in the language in question.  I don't know offhand<br>
: if total neologism-ism has ever happened; I think it would require a<br>
: completely isolated, unified speech community.<br>
<p>
Doesn't Chinese come close?  -- I often wonder whether Chinese<br>
fantasy writers invent characters for fantasy countries, or what.<br>
<p>
Poul Anderson has written a couple of scientific articles in<br>
pure (Germanic) English: one of them is called "The Round-and-round<br>
Board of the Firststuffs" (the periodic table of the elements).<br>
<p>
: BTW, does anyone else on this list have much in the way of<br>
: a linguistics background?<br>
<p>
I took a few courses.  My main interest is hist.ling., which (I<br>
gather) was once central but has become a peripheral specialty.<br>
