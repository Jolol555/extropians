Kathryn Aegis:<br>
<i>&gt; Kyle Webb:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Geez, lighten up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, thank you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My reaction to Anton's posting has more to do with my reasons for </i><br>
<i>&gt; being on this list rather than the fact that he owns a gun.  I'm here </i><br>
<i>&gt; to work with others to find the new ways in which humans will move </i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond their present state.  I'm looking for the new stories that </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be told, and the new technologies that will take us there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed </i><br>
<i>&gt; solely for the killing and maiming of other humans relates to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will listen.</i><br>
<p>
I have no such arguments, but the vibe that I get on this is very similiar <br>
to a number of people I knew in the L5 Society, and the National Space Society.<br>
Most people were fine, but a small minority got to where they couldn't see <br>
anything about the world around save in the light of "how will this get us <br>
into space". They lost all sense of proportion, would attack anyone they <br>
saw as standing in their way, or even just not actively aiding them. <br>
They ultimately became a hindrance to the very goals they <br>
wanted as they so put off anyone else they came in contact with. In fact,<br>
what they resembled more than anything else, were members of a fundamentalist <br>
religion. I doubt that's the way you really are, but it's how you're coming <br>
off on this thread.<br>
Given some of the other off topic and inane dreck that's been posted to the<br>
list of late (leading to the whole argument about restricting the list or <br>
creating a sublist), this thread is by no means that far out there.<br>
I think what's happening is that we've come across a subject you have very <br>
strong feelings about, and yet you don't feel good about stating your <br>
opposition in terms of restrictions on individuals due to the libertarian <br>
nature of much of the traffic on the list, and so you are retreating into <br>
germaneness as it were, as an argument tactic by other means.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't </i><br>
<i>&gt; explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we </i><br>
<i>&gt; working towards, anyway?</i><br>
<p>
What I'm working toward is a future that will allow me and those I care about<br>
to have long happy lives with all sorts of wonderful new capabilities and<br>
possibilities. I've given up a lot to go along that road. I gave up a career<br>
in the Army. I've spent years with school debts hanging swordlike over my <br>
head to pursue physics when it's been repeatedly and painfully pointed out <br>
that I could pay them down in just a year or two of sysadmin work. <br>
I've moved away from family and friends to chase this nanotech phantom in the <br>
mist ahead of me. But I have yet to lose my sense of humor, and ability to <br>
laugh at the very goals I strive toward. <br>
The day I do, I'll be less than what I was. This is far too important (and <br>
speculative) to take completely seriously.<br>
Along those lines, I refuse to subordinate what I consider one of the best <br>
parts of my humanity. My ability to feel joy, and to take pleasure in the <br>
joy of others. Anton's post was one you fealt strongly about, so you <br>
threw cold water on his enjoyment, and came off as sounding rather puritan. <br>
Again, I doubt that's the way you really are. The written format of mailing <br>
lists tends to give a much stronger tone to what is said than usually is meant.<br>
I'm sure that a good bit of what I write sounds "ranting and raving" compared <br>
to how I mean it. All the more so, since I frequent some very high flame level <br>
newsgroups. If I come across as denigrating you or your feelings, my <br>
apologies. But just like you are sensitive to the gun debate, this excessive <br>
seriousness is an area that I'm a bit sensitive to. <br>
