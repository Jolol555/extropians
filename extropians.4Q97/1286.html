<p>
<p>
  IAN: I know your not being flip, <br>
  unfortunately your absolutely right. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Stay alert, read Sun Tzu...</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: It's been several months since the <br>
  death threat,  saying if I continued my<br>
  inquiry into TWA 800 I might be killed.<br>
  But I never know. With the heavy media <br>
  hits, backing off seems best, forever.<br>
<p>
  One private TWA 800 investigator in <br>
  L.A. just disappeared into tin air, <br>
  never to be seen again:<br>

THE PRESS-ENTERPRISE (10/28/1997)<br>
<p>
Man's disappearance remains a mystery<br>
<p>
By Mark Henry<br>
PALM SPRINGS<br>
<p>
The disappearance of civic watchdog Jeremy Crocker <br>
while researching the crash of TWA Flight 800 last <br>
year has left his two sons baffled and searching <br>
for any sign that their father is still alive.<br>
<p>
Crocker, a longtime Palm Springs resident whose <br>
father built the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, was <br>
last seen Dec. 9 at the downtown Los Angeles library <br>
where he did much of his research on the crash.<br>
<p>
His preoccupation with the airline crash included <br>
countless hours of research in libraries and on <br>
the Internet. He did not trust the government's <br>
probes of the crash and believed a projectile <br>
knocked the airliner from the skies. He created <br>
mathematical models and studied the aerodynamics <br>
of the crash and similarities to other air <br>
disasters worldwide.<br>
<p>
...Crocker's two grown sons...believe their father's <br>
disapperance may be connected to the July 17, 1996 <br>
crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island.<br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: I suspect that he was so caught up<br>
   in thinking about his research as he was<br>
   walking, he fell into an open manhole and<br>
   was washed away,  showing how researching<br>
   this case can be a dangerous affair. Hell,<br>
   every researcher has either been visited <br>
   by the FBI or pounded on by the media.<br>
<p>
