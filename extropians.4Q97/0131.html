Dear Kennita Watson and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
The ability to learn is more than slightly dependent on the desire or<br>
willingness of any individual to learn. The biggest handicaps to learning<br>
are the arrogance and self-righteous egotism that frequently accompany<br>
ignorance. <br>
<p>
The desire to learn frequently involves the application of an informal or<br>
social as well as a formal academic teacher-student relationship. Just as<br>
no one should ever be ashamed of asking for information, no one has any<br>
valid reason to be critical of any method intended in good faith to<br>
provide information. <br>
<p>
Offering alternative methods of learning are always desirable. No mode of<br>
learning, however obscure is invalid. Nor should any well intentioned<br>
offer of information ever be rejected on its face value. Always<br>
constructively consider the motives of the source.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>

Ah -- this presumes that your correspondent has consented to a student-<br>
teacher relationship.  I am a very busy person.  If I want references,<br>
I'll ask for them -- otherwise I'd rather have the information I request<br>
in the most clear and concise form possible.  If said information piques<br>
my interest, I may ask for and/or look up references on my own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a different angle -- beware judging, particularly negatively</i><br>
judging,<br>
the levels of understanding, initiative, and/or self-actualization of<br>
another.  Or, more fliply put:  Who voted you Socrates?  :-)<br>
