<p>
It is the other way around, I said earlier that we have to<br>
eliminate<br>
the 'self-destructiveness' or other detrimental elements of our <br>
Human Kind before uploading it to these machines.....<br>
<p>
Or having software bulit on board to contract these detrimental<br>
elements ,.... Now, RE : earlier post on Why Uplift ?<br>
<p>
Definition of what 'dangerous' is what's detrimental to<br>
end-result of these uplifted / uploaded entities ....  <br>
Don't want these machines blowing each other up ,... rather<br>
peaceful; harmonious; fact-gathering; sentient etc ...<br>
History from our own Human Race ,.. shows up these detrimental<br>
elements in our race that we must learn to have mastery over .....<br>
:0<br>
Again I emphasize that we must be careful to upload / uplift what<br>
is beneficial to the advancement of human kind,... agreed ....?<br>
We're talking about self-replicating machines and uplifted<br>
species that reproduce themselves ,... that means we're going to<br>
end up with an exponentiating problem or solution for our<br>
extropian causes<br>
agreed ? :-)<br>
<p>
and Super-tigers do get to vote, provided we don't put spray them<br>
down with Uzis for terrorizing people at the polling booths ,...<br>
and if they can behave themselves ,... there's no need to spray<br>
them down,.... :-)<br>
Wonder whether SPCA will be around at that time ?<br>
