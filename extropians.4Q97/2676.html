<p>
But humans are killed all the time, not only by other humans, but by<br>
viruses, bacteria, etc.  For the record, I feel it is a good thing that<br>
humans are not routinely chased and killed by leopards or wolf packs<br>
in my neighborhood.  Those that feel otherwise are always free to light<br>
out for the wild places and go one on one with their favorite predator.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I know it sounds very absured, BUT... nature developed the way it did </i><br>

<p>
I disagree.  The Earth's biosphere developed as it did just because of<br>
the contigencies that happened throughout its history.  Humans are<br>
not outside of it, but it is not a system of balances.  There certainly are<br>
some processes that appear to balance, but their is no design or<br>
reason for these.  They just happened to come about and are stable<br>
for now.  Many other things are unstable or only metastable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ever stopped to think about what kind of pisition we're really in.  We </i><br>
<i>&gt;have no predators.</i><br>
<p>
One word: shark!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We've learned how to farm and now have a surplus of food.  We're </i><br>
<i>&gt;breaking nature's set balances, and isn't life grand?</i><br>
<p>
The balance metaphor fits more the TV documentary view of the wild<br>
than the reality.  Other organisms, from trees to bees, create<br>
surpluses.<br>
Some even upset so called balances -- look at the spread of aerobic<br>
bacteria or postCambrian animals.  These changes literally destroyed<br>
prior ecosystems.  Today, as far as we know, there are no preCambrian<br>
animals and anaerobic bacteria are still around, but have a very<br>
marginal<br>
existence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What happens when those checks and balances aren't there to keep </i><br>
<i>&gt;things under control?  Population increase.  With less death, and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;food, the population increases; obvious enough.  Population increases, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and demand for food and living space does too, does it not?  What </i><br>
<i>&gt;happens when the worlds population gets so large that there isn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough living space and food?  We'll have to end up destroying critical </i><br>
<i>&gt;ecosystems so that we can pile ourselves into their space.  And what</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens when that living space is full?</i><br>
<p>
This all sounds like the conventional environmental view of life on<br>
planet<br>
Earth.  The problem is there is no real population problem for humans.<br>
There are some management problems, which free markets and<br>
assigning property rights can take care of, but the Earth's human<br>
population is relatively small given the human capacity for efficient<br>
use of resources.<br>
<p>
For a post on an Extropian/transhumanist list this does not seem to<br>
display a familiarity with some of the basic literature.  I recommend<br>
the works of Julian Simon, especially _The Ultimate Resource_.  (Simon<br>
is not an Extropian.  He's merely an economist who decided to see if<br>
the data fit the Malthusian view of scarcity.  It didn't and he was<br>
honest<br>
enough to see that.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Predators, and prey are here for a reason.  Our universe is a universe of </i><br>
<i>&gt;opposites. When there is too many of one or the other, things become </i><br>
<i>&gt;unstable, but when there is equal amounts, peace and balance.  Light</i><br>
<i>&gt;and dark, predators and prey, positive charge and negative charge, </i><br>
<i>&gt;good and evil.</i><br>
<p>
This begins to sound like something from a pamphlet.  Opposites are<br>
only so in relation to the human mind.  In reality, things just are what<br>
they are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Think about a virus for a minute.  Similar to something living, a virus' </i><br>
<i>&gt;only purpose is basically to destroy life.  Why did it ever </i><br>
<i>&gt;evlove/develope/come to be?  For what purpose?  Maybe a natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;population control.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe not.  By this reckoning, anything that depends on using <br>
something else has its "only purpose" as "to destroy life."  If<br>
"purpose"<br>
can be applied to viruses, then it would appear their purpose is to make<br>
more of themselves.  Destroying only happens incidentally.   In fact,<br>
many (most?) viruses do not kill.  Witness the common cold.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ever notice usually when there's a large spread of disease</i><br>
<i>&gt;in nature, it seems to come out of no where, kills of the abudence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals, and then is gone again just like that.</i><br>
<p>
It would seem Mike Everett wants to think there is some cunning power <br>
that creates diseases to cull the population.  What actually happens is<br>
diseases spread and the ones that kill their hosts tend to burn out<br>
very quickly.  This is not balance.  It's actually a metastable state.<br>
Such diseases can only survive in very regions, which is why epidemics<br>
are so rare.  If they were not, they would wipe out their host<br>
population<br>
and in the process destroy themselves.  To be sure, some do, and<br>
they are no longer around to inflict themselves on other hosts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Who knows perhaps in that sense guns could be a good thing, if the </i><br>
<i>&gt;population ever gets out of hand, there's bound to be disagreements </i><br>
<i>&gt;and discord, maybe we'll all kill eachother off and things will be all </i><br>
<i>&gt;peachy again.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, the opposite seems to happen.  In the US, states that have<br>
less gun control, have less violence.  If this was not the case,<br>
humanity<br>
would have destroyed itself long ago.  Recall guns have been around<br>
for how many centuries?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Same with disease.  We keep finding cures and more lethal and </i><br>
<i>&gt;complex diseases arrive.  A sign maybe?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe not.  Perhaps people long ago died of some of these diseases,<br>
but they were diagnosed as something else.  If, e.g., AIDS is really<br>
caused by HIV, would some tribe in the Congo be able to tell whether<br>
one of its member died because of HIV killing his/her immune system<br>
or just that that person had a weak immune system and caugh<br>
pneumonia?<br>
<p>
Also, note how few people are actually afflicted with these rare, new<br>
diseases.  Heart disease is still the number one killer of Americans,<br>
for example, and the cure is pretty easy in most cases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ok I know you're thinking now that I'm way off the subject, and I am.</i><br>
<i>&gt;:) Just thought it was an interesting point to touch upon.  Ever notice </i><br>
<i>&gt;it's universally accepted that basically man was meant to conquer the </i><br>
<i>&gt;earth, and that the earth was almost made for man's triumphs.  We </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't even think about it, we just accept it.  Why live at the mercy of </i><br>
<i>&gt;nature when nature can live at the mercy of us?  There are reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt;why.  There are laws to life and balances.  If we don't abide by them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;something's bound to happen.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds like a recipe for dictatorship.  I say, yes, there are<br>
natural laws, but these are not the warm and fuzzy "all is balance"<br>
ones.  And they need to be understood not idolized.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We keep progressing, and searching for new technology, but to what </i><br>
<i>&gt;end?</i><br>
<p>
If one has to ask...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And for what purpose?</i><br>
<p>
Happiness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We seem to want to achieve and ultimate standard of living, food for</i><br>
<i>&gt;all, no pain.  But at this rate will we ever get there?  Think of all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultures we consider primative.  There are many island cultures, very </i><br>
<i>&gt;old, some culutres tens of thousands of years old.  And the thing is, </i><br>
<i>&gt;they have discovered a way of life that works for them.  They are </i><br>
<i>&gt;content, they take what they need, and give back.  They follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt;balance.  Now if they can survive in peace with nature for that long, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;damn amazing feat.</i><br>
<p>
Which ones?  The Tahitian society that Cook found, for instance, was<br>
a strict oligarchy, where one tribe basically squashed another.  This<br>
noble savage stuff is way off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And when we come and wipe them out with our </i><br>
<i>&gt;guns, to take their land and resources for our expanding population it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually quite sickening.</i><br>
<p>
I agree because it is done _involuntarily_.  The actual process of<br>
imperialism does not really pay off and most resources, throughout<br>
history have not come from colonies.  They were usually side issues.<br>
For example, the British in the late 19th century -- the heyday of<br>
colonialism of this sort -- traded much more with the rest of Europe<br>
and America than it did with Africa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That system of living, all that knowledge, down the drain.</i><br>
<p>
I would not fret over that but over the violation of individual rights,<br>
specifically the murder and enslavement that went on.  But European<br>
colonials, bad as they were, were not in all cases attacking totally<br>
innocent noble savages.  In many cases, they were just the latest<br>
conquerors.  Recall the Aztecs had a huge empire before the Spanish<br>
decided to get a piece of the action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Heh, well as you can see I'm totally of the subject now, but I'm into</i><br>
<i>&gt;this, screw guns, I have my opinions you have yours.</i><br>
<p>
That last statement is the last refuge of people who have no<br>
justification.<br>
Opinions are not primaries.<br>
