Hi!<br>

I don't want to sound the convinced jerk I am, but I actually wrote on<br>
the 22nd of October;<br>
About body transplants using cloning to create new bodies, it's not such<br>
a futuristic achievement. Did you know that there has already been body<br>
transplants<br>
is monkeys and dogs? And that there are plans to try it on humans on a<br>
near future? Besides, human cloning can be technically possible in a<br>
very short time (some claim that it is already possible in the present).<br>
<p>
Anyway, about the procedure, I think we should look at other<br>
alternatives. Body transplants are not only too dangerous - whatever the<br>
scientific progresses are -, but<br>
they are also extremely demanding in terms of resources.<br>
<p>
See ya, sorry for having to point out this detail but I also like some<br>
credit to myself once in a while,<br>
