    Yeah I hope you read my other response I just posted (should arrive sometime<br>
just before this one).  I was sort of worked up when I posted that other one.  Yeah<br>
that story is seriously sickening.  It is a hard choice to make.  But that's one<br>
life opposed to thousands man.  How about the millions of jews who died in<br>
concentration camps in WWII?  That couldn't really do much about soldiers armed<br>
with guns and other weaponry forcing them to move along, and to do horrible things,<br>
who would shoot them at an instence if they tried anything.  And who's to say that<br>
sicko who from that incedent might not be the one ending up with the gun, and<br>
holding that girl at gun point.  It goes either ways, but I think that the<br>
elimination of guns would on a whole, have a lot more weight  as far as lives saved<br>
than if people are encouraged to own one.<br>
    The problem is, a gun is just too deadly, and too easy.  Newer generations just<br>
have no respect for their power.  Many teenagers wouldn't think twice about ending<br>
another's life at the pull of a trigger.  And if an uprising goes down in the<br>
future, they're going to be the ones wielding the guns.  I know myself I have<br>
friends who own guns, and it's more or less a game to them.  They just want to have<br>
a flashier gun than their friends.  Sure they have a blast, they go out, shoot<br>
things, small animals, they go hunting.  Yeah it's all fun and games.  But the<br>
thing is it's not.<br>
    Im obviously aware that there's really no way we could ever just *poof* take<br>
guns right out of society.  They're a part of our lives.  I'm not suggesting that.<br>
I'm saying hey, take a look at what kind of things are produced from guns.  When<br>
the pros are outweighed by the cons, is it really such a good idea to try and go on<br>
defending it?  I mean if you own a gun, and you're proud, good, I'm happy for you.<br>
Just don't say, "guns are great, I love 'em, there's nothing wrong in the world<br>
with guns," because that's not true.  Guns are bad, not to say they're aren't good<br>
sides. But own up to it, don't deny that when you support guns, you also support<br>
all the unnecessary violence and death that comes with them.  Know that when somone<br>
carries a gun, somone one else is going to die, it's inevitable, wether or not the<br>
person who owns the gun is a moral person or not.  Many try to defend saying guns<br>
protect, so how can anyone say they're bad.  But you don't look far enough to see<br>
that if guns didn't even exist at all there would be a lot less to have to protect<br>
one's self from. Ok I'm out.<br>

Peace<br>
