May I point out that this is an interpretation, a judgement on your part,<br>
and not a hard fact?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;some list subscribers are taking with regards to the</i><br>

<i>&gt;while. If I were the powers that be, I'd keep the main list open and</i><br>

<p>
That might work too. I have no particular problem with that, provided that<br>
it costs something of value, p front, not necessarily money but something<br>
of value that must be redeemed, to join the "higher level" lists. PLEAS PAY<br>
SPECIAL NOTE that "higher level" is again your interpretation, not<br>
necessarily A Fact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Its not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost that implies the "cult" flavor, its the isolationist attitude.</i><br>
<p>
BZZZZT. Facts not in evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Those who don't want to be bothered with helping enlighten newbies to</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropianism shouldn't have kept their subscription when the list went</i><br>
<i>&gt;public.</i><br>
<p>
Michael, where do _I_ fit in? Are you telling me, a person who never joined<br>
until "the list went public", that I should never have joined? This doesn't<br>
make any sense to me; Help me out here, please.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Here's an interim suggestion: Have a free subscription period, of say 3,</i><br>
<i>&gt;6 or 12 months. Then have a subscription rate for further membership to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the list.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a suggestion: Have a list where I can talk to people I trust and<br>
respect, and other people can listen in. It's no more elitist than a panel<br>
discussion on TV, and it only costs money if you want to subscribe with<br>
write-privs to the list. And as I mentioned before, there's CRIT.<br>
<p>
I don't see this as isolationist. Nor any more elitist than a gas station.<br>
TANSTAAFL. My attention is worth something, AND SO IS YOURS. Get it? :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For those that complain about too much noise and too little substance,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you should be pushing the list owners to police relevancy/ongoing</i><br>
<i>&gt;stupidity more effectively. Subscribers should also police themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you think someone is not on topic, first a) check the FAQ yourself,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then b) email the relevant text in the FAQ to the offender.</i><br>
<p>
Allow me to render a free translation: We should be perfect people, and<br>
then any system would work.<br>
<p>
BZZZZZT.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many people here who are ardent libertarians seem to be rather welfarish</i><br>
<i>&gt;in their attitude toward noise/signal on the list. </i><br>
<p>
I suggest you look to the seeming. I am offering to pay my own way; a<br>
moment ago you were advocating that the list owners do more "policing".<br>
There are at least two ironies here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you think someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;is an ingnorant nincompoop, use personal email to go into long and</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficient detail to educate the novice as to his or her error. </i><br>
<p>
That's fine, IF you want to. Feeling obliged, OTOH, seems like<br>
lightly-veiled, well, does the word "welfarish" ring a bell?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;THose</i><br>
<i>&gt;who are too stubbornly newbie for it to have any effect on usually dig</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves deep enough for some real fun once they get into rude enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;territory. </i><br>
<p>
I don't want to play that game so much any more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are not taking personal responsibility for fixing up</i><br>
<i>&gt;the signal to noise on the list, then its your fault. &gt;</i><br>
<p>
In your judgement. I believe I am taking personal responsibility by letting<br>
the world (instead of just Max) know that I approve of the experiment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find the threat</i><br>
<i>&gt;of high subscription rates simply the moral equivalent of trade</i><br>
<i>&gt;restrictions. Hardly libertarian.</i><br>
<p>
Au contraire. The tragedy of the commons is being enacted out all around us. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- </i><br>
<i>&gt;TANSTAAFL!!!</i><br>
<p>
Except in the extropy list, where we are supposed to give without end for<br>
the good of the list, but it's still "free", but paying money for it is<br>
sinful. *hunh*???<br>
