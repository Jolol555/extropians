To show cross-breeding of chimps and humans can be done? If so, you're right, it<br>
would be a cheap,quick way to show it could be done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;My personal ethics can accomodate an uplift by way of cortical augmentation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;or other such biological procedure, but only insofar as it provides</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;empirical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;data for use in similar procedures on humans. It seems unlikely that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;crossbreeding a chimpanzee with a human will give us any information along</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;these lines and I have difficulty viewing this as uplifting a chimp, rather,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;it seems more like retarding a human being on purpose, and for no valid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;reason.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I understand.  It was merely a suggestion.  Recall my initial post.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some people outside this list agree with you -- viz., that uplifting</i><br>
<i>&gt; is akin to trapping a human mind in a nonhuman (less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; human?) body.</i><br>
<p>
No, no. I'm not talking about uplifting, which I find to be pretty fascinating.<br>
I'm talking about a mere cross-breed of chimp and human. What would be the purpose<br>
other than to show that a cross-breed is possible?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  However, would you judge it the same if, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we found a genetic sequence which would increase intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; in chimps, would it be wrong to insert it in them?</i><br>
<p>
(I'll refrain from using "wrong.")<br>
<p>
Inserting a genetic sequence to increase chimp intelligence is not unethical in my<br>
view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If not, imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this sequence is from a human.  Is it still not wrong to insert</i><br>
<i>&gt; it?</i><br>
<p>
It's still not unethical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If not, imagine (I know this is getting repetitive:) it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; substantial amount of human genes and the method of</i><br>
<i>&gt; insertion is artsem.  Is it still not wrong?</i><br>
<p>
Now it is unethical.<br>
<p>
You're not inserting anything, except in a ribald, figurative sense.<br>
<p>
Inserting a sequence of human genes to improve an animal is much different than<br>
the wholesale blending of human genes with chimpanzee genes to make some new,<br>
still not human-equivalent, species of animal. It's not human, and it's not a<br>
chimp. Sure it's still a primate, but if the only goal is merely a smarter primate<br>
-- well, just look in the mirror. With uplifting, our goal is not merely a smarter<br>
primate, but specifically, a smarter chimp. Artifical insemination (I'm assuming<br>
this is what "artsem" means) does not meet this goal, and we learn nothing about<br>
how to augment human beings. In short, uplifting a chimp to human intelligence is<br>
okay by me because it's still a chimp -- and it's a better chimp by my standard<br>
(smarter = better) -- and we gain valuable empirical data for use in augmenting<br>
ourselves. Mere cross-breeding is not the same as uplifting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  At what point did the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment become wrong</i><br>
<p>
The experiment became unethical at the exact moment when your goal went from<br>
"let's make a chimp smarter" to "let's see if this can be done."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and why?</i><br>
<p>
The belief that "anything that can be done should be done" is the exact reason why<br>
ethical systems develop in the first place. We are not intelligent enough to know<br>
what is objectively good or objectively bad in every situation. Given this, we<br>
also take prima facie that "not everything that can be done, should be done." In<br>
addition, we don't even necessarily need to so somethings to know they can be<br>
done. At first, I was asking what other purpose this experiment could have, given<br>
that I wasn't entirely certain if it was ethical or not. Since the only other<br>
purpose you offered was "can be done, should be done," I regard this as without<br>
ethic, which means for me, unethical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What standard do we</i><br>
<i>&gt; use to judge?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The question is better put, what standard do *you* use to judge? Moral relativism<br>
is serving me well these days...<br>
<p>
But scientists do have ethical guidelines for themselves. Unfortunately, they<br>
don't help much when you're stuck in the middle of a gray area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;I think any serious proponents of this idea need to answer at least two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;1. Will crossbreeding chimps and humans help us augment human beings?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe my initial post answers this question.  The data from it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; also give us more parameters on just how far intelligence can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; stretched inside the biotic realm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If your above suggestion is true (not just hand-waving), then it may be a valid<br>
reason. I don't want to argue the merits, but suffice it to say, if I were<br>
deciding funding, I'd need some pretty good evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;2. Is there any other reason to do it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe my initial post answers this one too.  However, I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; better to try uplifting with other species and not use crossbreeding.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>
