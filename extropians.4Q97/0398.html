Well, and make a backup of my current state, and detect and abort<br>
pathological results, and observe the 3 laws of robotics, and... <br>
<p>
I've played with the "magic wand" notion for over 20 years, and have a<br>
long list of things I have thought of. It's been instructive in terms of<br>
the tendencies of my creative thinking.... A few for your consideration:<br>
<p>
	1. Enhancement of various physical attributes of my body,<br>
	   or experiences physiologically impossible. Example:<br>
	   Ejaculation of gallons of semen. (I have other examples<br>
	   which to say the least are socially objectionable.)<br>
<p>
	2. Pills, suitably color coded, to cure any disease or provide<br>
	   well defined visionary experiences. Examples: HIV cure,<br>
	   Sex with the partner of your dreams.<br>
<p>
	3. Teleport booths, transfer gates - standard science fiction<br>
	   stuff.<br>
<p>
	4. Viewer of any point in space, and maybe time.<br>
<p>
	5. Force-o - Object the size of a quarter, provides 1 kg/milliampere<br>
	   force in direction of current, resistance 1 ohm.<br>
<p>
	6. Doorways to same point, but to an earth in which humans didn't<br>
	   develop.<br>
<p>
	7. Stasis box. (see Larry Niven)<br>
<p>
	8. Additional rooms to my house, a door sized poster, which when put up<br>
	   and activated, provide extra space in some other dimension without<br>
	   using more space in my place. Design of room up to my imagination.<br>
<p>
	9. Infinite CPU - once loaded, press 'run' and result appears in no<br>
	   time...<br>
<p>
Enjoy...<br>
