I thought Permutation City was flawed in two ways.  First, this "dust"<br>
hypothesis, which as I read it is basically a Moravec-style platonic<br>
realism - that any computation which can exist does exist.  The whole<br>
metaphysical aspect that a more-detailed simulation would somehow overcome<br>
or destroy a less-detailed simulation seemed implausible to me.<br>
<p>
Second, the book describes a bizarre sequence of events: a character who<br>
experiences uploading in one universe has the exact same brain state as<br>
a character who is insane and _thinks_ he experienced uploading in another<br>
universe.  When the first upload is terminated, the second character<br>
proceeds to gradually overcome his insanity.  (At least, that's what I<br>
think is supposed to have happened.  Another interpretation which is<br>
technically as plausible is that the character was simply insane and had<br>
an insane vision of the universe which turned out, against all odds, to be<br>
true.)<br>
<p>
This is related to the many-minds school of QM, where an entity with<br>
a given brain state can be said to span many (perhaps infinitely many)<br>
parallel universes.  My mind right now is shared among multiple instances<br>
in different universes.  As events happen which distinguish the universes,<br>
my mind in effect splits into multiple, disjoint, non-interacting parts.<br>
Conceivably in some of those universes I could be uploads, being watched<br>
over by beings who are simulating me, while in others I could be living in<br>
the base reality.  In yet others I could be in some kind of VR.  And I<br>
suppose in some I could be an insane alien being who has fantasized<br>
the entire world of human existence, including an identity for himself<br>
which happens coincidentally to match in every detail my own identity.<br>
With an infinite number of universes, it's bound to happen somewhere.<br>
This last case is the most similar to the situation in Permutation City,<br>
and I think it is equally implausible.<br>
