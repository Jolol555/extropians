<i>&gt; Er, the Latin alphabet was pretty derived itself.  Alphabetic systems</i><br>

<i>&gt; are traced back to the Semites.  So I could mean an original Semitic</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Digression:</i><br>
<i>&gt; The uniqueness is in using phonemes as elements, rather than syllables or</i><br>
<i>&gt; words.  The other two types of systems have been independently invented</i><br>
<i>&gt; multiple times; all true alphabets can be traced, in probable</i><br>
<i>&gt; inspiration if not in design, to the Semites.  The original alphabet</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't have any vowels in it, and recently I've wondered if from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Semitic point of view it was functionally a syllabary.  In which case</i><br>
<i>&gt; the true alphabet was actually invented by some Greek(s) who adopted the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Semitic symbols, realized that none of them coded for vowels, fixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, and thus accidentally created a phonemic alphabet whereas left to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own devices they'd probably have created a syllabary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Significance: English uses over a thousand different syllables, but 26</i><br>
<i>&gt; letters.  We could use a few more, but still fewer than 50.  Syllabaries</i><br>
<i>&gt; often have 50-75 symbols, meaning their language is restricted to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; many syllables.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; Disclaimer: That's largely my only source; don't take this as expert</i><br>
<i>&gt; information.</i><br>

<p>
I consider this subject to be very relevant ot transhumanism. In<br>
particular, it may relate to the "how the west was won" thread,<br>
and more generally to how we encode what we think.<br>
<p>
I don't know about syllabaries in general, but I do know a little<br>
about Japanese. The Japanese syllabary, or Kana, is called<br>
"the 50 sounds." It has 50 symbols, and is formally arranged<br>
in a five-by-ten matrix. There are 5 vowel sounds, and each column<br>
of the matrix corresponds to a vowel. There are 9 consonant sounds,<br>
the first row of the matrix contains syllables for the vowels, and<br>
each of the remaining 9 rows contains the syllables for a consonant<br>
followed by the vowel.<br>
<p>
Three of the syllables in the "w" row have fallen into disuse, so<br>
when Japanese school children sing their version of the alphabet<br>
song they replace these syllables with the vowel syllable to retain<br>
the 5-sound pattern, and when they write out the matrix they leave<br>
the entries blank.<br>
<p>
The syllabary actually contains a great many more syllables, because<br>
there are several ways to modify each syllable:<br>
1) there is a mark that lengthens the vowel, yielding a total of 10<br>
vowels.<br>
2) there is a symbol that adds an "n" to the end of a syllable<br>
3) There is a mark that changes the consonant to another consonant,<br>
  so there are actually 18 consonants, not 9.<br>
4) there is yet another mark that converts a few (2?) of the consonants<br>
to get consonants for foreign words yielding a total of 20 consonants.<br>
<p>
So, japanese has 10 vowels and 20 consonants, for 210 syllables, each of<br>
which can be used with or without the trailing "n", for about 420<br>
syllables. All syllables are either vowel, consonant-vowel, or<br>
consonant-vowel-n.<br>
<p>
There are a few exceptions, but they relate to variations of the way<br>
you pronounce a particular syllable in context with another. For<br>
instance,<br>
the trailing "n" is pronounced as an "m" in some cases, and when the<br>
syllable "shi" is followed by a syllable starting with "t", the "i" is<br>
dropped. However, you cannot create new syllables as we do in English:<br>
you are stuck with the 420 syllables of the Kana (The mis-named 50<br>
sounds). <br>
<p>
Why is this relevant? isn't it just a coding convention? I don't think<br>
so.<br>
A person whose first language is japanese apparently has a grat deal of<br>
difficulty thinking about syllables that do not fit into this scheme.<br>
Does this constrain the way the japanese think? If so, how are english<br>
speakers constrained? Will we need some other representational method<br>
to relieve these constraints?<br>
