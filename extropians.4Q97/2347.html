<i>&gt; Communication is transportation if it's good enough.</i><br>
<p>
	By "good enough" you mean the addition of a constructor that<br>
can take the communicated information and reproduce (teletransport?)<br>
the subject at the destination?  To me, communication is just a part<br>
of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I want to send a message to a receiver 2 things must happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) I must change something in the receiver.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) The receiver must be able to compare that change with something</i><br>
<i>&gt; else, such as the voltage on a wire now compared to what it was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanosecond ago.</i><br>
<p>
	What?  If you can't detect any change (#2) how could one claim<br>
a change (#1) has even occured?  If it's not detectable wouldn't it be<br>
much simpler (Occam's razor) to simply say the change hadn't really<br>
occured making it all very newtonian?  Isn't it simply that for<br>
communication to occur some DETECTABLE change must be caused at the<br>
destination?<br>
<p>
	Hey, didn't you know I can travel faster than the speed of<br>
light any time I want to!!??  Watch this!  There, I just traveled to<br>
the other side of the galaxy and back between keystrokes!  And just to<br>
prove I was really there I made a change while over there.  Of course<br>
this change (and the fact that I traveled there) is completely<br>
undetectable to anyone, but hey, trust me, I really did make that<br>
undetectable change. ;)<br>
