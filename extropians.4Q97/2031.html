<i>&gt; Personally I think one of the issues is that, given the increase of interest in</i><br>

<p>
I think there is an increasing need to diversify this list, yes, but<br>
it is also important to have some main channel of communication which<br>
can reach a large percentage of the extropians if we want the movement<br>
to remain cohesive. A tricky balance.<br>
