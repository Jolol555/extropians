I don't like wasting list space arguing with these folks, but I don't like<br>
letting their assertions slip into the archives unchallenged either.  Perhaps<br>
a good solution would be to revive the classifiers (BASIC, META, etc.) and<br>
reserve one of them for these rehash discussions, so people can filter them<br>
out easily.  We could use BASIC, or invent a new one.  A non-pejorative one<br>
would be best, I suppose, although I'm mighty tempted to stamp REHASH on some<br>
such of these things :-)<br>
