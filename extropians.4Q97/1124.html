He suffered from schizophrenia, I have read, so it must have been  <br>
easy for a causual observer to dismiss him as a crackpot &amp; madman. <br>
There seems to have been a large number of outstanding logicians <br>
that had, or were redarded as having, psychological problems <br>
(Goedel starved himself to death because of paranoia, Russell <br>
suffered from depression, Whitehead was on the brink of nervous <br>
breakdown, Turing was regarded as psychologically disturbed because <br>
of his homosexuality. I'm sure somebody could make the list much <br>
longer, but it might well just be a coincidence.<br>

<i>&gt; Cantor proved that the number of integers, call it A, is the smallest </i><br>

<p>
That is to say, the smallest *infinite* cardinal number. There are <br>
also finite cardinal numbers.<br>
