    Perhaps you forgot about something called competition.  In the wild animals<br>
kill and get killed all the time. It keeps things in balance.  Say we take out all<br>
our predators, and have no threat left, the population will explode and food and<br>
living space will eventually run out.  I know thats fairly extreme, but it's<br>
something in the future that we will have to think about.  Before man came weilding<br>
our crafty little weapons, nature was in a perfect balance give or take the many<br>
natural disasters that happen on and off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; of evolution mentally.  I hope that you could clearly see, if there ever is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; totally unified society, it's not going to work unless we get rid of weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Totally unified society" is not something we all understand.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  There are always going to be differences.  If you haven't noticed, the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; population is going up, not down, and we are using more natural resources than</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever.  Eventually we're going to be faced with problems when the population</i><br>
<i>&gt; because to great, or something similar spawned from our knew era of technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless we banned together and try to solve problems for the human race as a whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of worrying about our petty differences, I doubt we'll make it.  I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is way, way in the future, but I still think its an interesting thought.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; these weapons had never been invented, imagine how many wars could have been,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and will be avoided if men walked onto the battle field armed only with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sword.  When you don't have the comfort a multi-billion dollar war plane to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aid you so you don't have too see the faces of all the human beings you kill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you tend to think twice about going to war.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Really.  My my.  That is not the impression I get from history.  I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty sure I've read about lots of wars in the distant past.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Persian Wars, the Peleponesian wars, Alexander the Great, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand-year history of Rome, the Mongols, the early Islamic Empire...</i><br>
<i>&gt; all these people thought twice about going to war?  I'd hate to see what</i><br>
<i>&gt; happened when they only thought once.</i><br>
<p>
    I hope you would have realized by now that societal views and values have come<br>
a long way since then.  I'm not talking about thousands of years ago.  I'm talking<br>
about presently.  Within the last few centuries.  And I'd like to see you look me<br>
in the face and tell me you wouldn't be more confident to go into war armed with<br>
radar, machine guns, tanks, jets, bombs, stealth technology, etc. than if you only<br>
had a sword.  That was my point, I suppose I didn't set it up very well.  I'm just<br>
saying when you don't have these comforts of modern combat, you tend to take a<br>
second thought and make sure what you are about to fight for is really worth it?<br>
Dig?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; more blood won't be spilt.  There is no valid purpose today to own or use a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gun, unless you are an enforcer of the law, and it is absolutely dire that</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And we can all trust all of the enforcers of the law!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    I have to agree with you there.  I'm just saying, guns aren't a necessity of<br>
life.  You could live without a gun no?  And yes you say you need one to protect<br>
yourself, but that's largely to crime that was made possible thanks to guns.  I'm<br>
trying to look at it as a hypothetical situation, where in no guns had ever<br>
existed.  Don't you think crime related deaths would be a lot lower?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do you think that gangs would be as previlent today if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the members went around armed with wooden sticks?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Feudalism."</i><br>
<p>
    Many of the inner city gangs today view guns as a sign of power and pride.  Too<br>
some, they're too ignorant to realize just how serious it all is.  Almost like a<br>
game.  It makes boys and men equal.  If gangs were based on brute strength and<br>
regular old street fighting, and members didn't have a gun to protect them, do you<br>
really think there would be as many deaths?  Drive by's? etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's amazing how the Cold War, the nuclear era, was one of the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; peaceful periods in Europe's entire history.  It still is peaceful,</i><br>
<i>&gt; apart from some fringe areas like Yugoslavia that don't have anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; more advanced than primitive artillery, and a bad distribution of guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
  Peaceful, but fearful.  You're living in your house with loved ones.  News has it<br>
an a-bomb might be dropped on your area any minute, any day, any second.  You live<br>
day in and day out in constant fear.  Is your exsitence peaceful?  No my friend,<br>
being able to live freely, and carefree from that sort of thing, thats living<br>
peaceful.  There's a difference between fearful peaceful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Try this idea out: danger is not in how much deadly power is available.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's in how it is distributed.  The left doesn't like concentrations of</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth, of _productive_ power; it's amazing that they don't see the</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessity of ensuring equality of destructive power.  One person with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sword isn't as deadly as a person with a gun... but it's hard to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; a good person with a sword, so those who do, rule.  Guns are easy.  Guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; are democratic.  There are rather few stable democracies which predate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the gun.  Iceland, perhaps.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    Potential energy, kenetic energy, it's still energy.  Potential destruction,<br>
active destruction, it's still destruction.  I'd don't think you see what I'm<br>
getting at.  How bout no destruction at all?  Guns are easy, guns are democratic.<br>
Those are some pretty immature statements man.  Life isn't easy, it's damn hard.<br>
How would you feel if I decided one day just to take yours away and make all your<br>
effort throughout life for nothing with my _easy_ gun?  It's amazing how much<br>
respect I lose when I have the ability to do such a thing, and not even have to<br>
work at it.  If I had to beat you to death with my bare hands,  I'm gonna think<br>
twice, and I'm gonna have respect.  (hehe don't worry just using it as an example,<br>
not threatening you)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; do just that, to me, is plain wrong.  Perhaps if people repected that power</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, but people do respect that power... especially when other people</i><br>
<i>&gt; wield it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    Oh come on...no they don't.  Do you think the little boy who finds his daddy's<br>
gun and accidently shoots his brothers brains all over the wall respected that<br>
power?  Do you think the boy who shoots a schoolmate because he stole his<br>
girlfriend respects that power?  Do you think the grown man who shoots down his<br>
wife because she left him after he beat her respects that power?  If people<br>
actually respected the power a gun weilds, there would be as many gun related<br>
deaths.    I know some of my logic in the first post was sorta messy, and still<br>
is.  I was a little worked up I suppose.  I just think you only half understood<br>
some of the statements I made, and I'm sure I only half understood some you made,<br>
so feel free to reply.Peace. :)<br>
