<i>&gt; Uh oh. If Anders is overloading, we're all in trouble. :)</i><br>
<p>
Maybe we should think of developing a tool of combatting future or now<br>
chock? Some way of getting an overall feeling of what is<br>
happening. History once served that purpose (and still work in many<br>
areas) but when it comes to the technological changes we need<br>
something new.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or because the country that built it no longer exists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mir presents an interesting oppoertunity for privatization: its </i><br>
<i>&gt; components will (stupidly!) not be used in the new International </i><br>
<i>&gt; Space Station, though the Russians did propose and push for this. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; are accustomed to reusing gear; some of Mir's equipment was salvaged</i><br>
<i>&gt; from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Salyut 7 (?), the previous station, and hence is older than Mir itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mir might be abandoned in place, a fully functioning, proven habitat</i><br>
<i>&gt; only</i><br>
<i>&gt; 11 years old. It would make a great construction shack.</i><br>
<p>
"Only some DIY refurbishing needed". I think Bruce Sterling wrote a<br>
short story about the last ageing russian cosmonaut on Mir, who eventually<br>
got some new neighbors as people from the stratospheric colonies moved<br>
in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ned Seeman is making octohedral, dodecahedral, and other DNA these</i><br>
<i>&gt; days, with stronger joints and "tabs" of single-strand DNA at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertices for connecting units together.</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention that one can show that there exists an isomorphism<br>
between the different kinds of DNA and the regular languages of<br>
computer science (things like that keeps hacker esthetes like me<br>
happy).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We will see hybrids of silicon/molecular machinery this year.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I think this will be the next big thing. The in-your-pocket<br>
pathogen analyser using mini-PCR and DNA-chips I discussed on another<br>
thread seems to be feasible, the biomedical researcher I talked with<br>
tonight didn't see any problem, except that she didn't believe there<br>
was a market for it :-)<br>
<p>
What I would like is a molecular film that acts as a cellular<br>
automaton. Maybe we could use the microtubule units?<br>
