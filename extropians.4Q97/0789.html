Foundations of Transhumanism is a new web site that will provide easy <br>
access to selected transhumanist material of an academic <br>
nature. I belive it is important that transhumanism begins to be <br>
done systematically and in a way that is academically respectable. I <br>
think we have so far done a comparatively good job in popularizing <br>
our ideas and making them available to the general educated public <br>
(which is extremely important). But if some student who is writing <br>
her MA, say, wants to do it in transhumanism, she will  have a hard <br>
time convincing her professors that this is really something more <br>
than science fiction and entertaining speculation. I have been <br>
contacted by several people with that predicament. It is especially <br>
hard to find transhumanist texts of the sort that are publishable in <br>
academic journals etc. So I think it is meaningful to have this site <br>
for academic transhumanists.<br>
<p>
In its present form, the page includes links to such works as the <br>
Engines of Creation, that are not really academic but nevertheless of <br>
a very high standard, if they are currently the best text available <br>
about a certain issue. Where no appropriate texts exist, I have in <br>
some cases inserted a shorter paper of my own as a temporary place-<br>
holder. More papers by various persons will be added by and by, but <br>
the emphasis is on quality rather then quantity.<br>
