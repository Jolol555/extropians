In the 70s Dr. John Lilly developed techniques whereby pretty much anyone<br>
could have an OOBE.  He then carried out the research you propose.  Alas,<br>
it turned out that people weren't actually leaving their body, they only<br>
thought they were.  What they saw when they "went somewhere" was not what<br>
was actually there, but what they thought should be there.  So it didn't<br>
replace airplanes.<br>
<p>
 There was an explosion of scientific investigation of 'altered states of<br>
consciousness' during the '60s and '70s.  It didn't pay off with the<br>
massive progress its proponents hoped for.  The altered states turned out<br>
not to be real useful, except possibly for psychotherapy, and all the easy<br>
and reliable methods of alteration involved abusable drugs which the<br>
government has chosen to suppress.  What techniques from that period are<br>
still in use?  Hypnotic psychotherapy, meditation and acupuncture<br>
anaesthesia are all I can think of, and none of them have had very big<br>
effects on the world.<br>
<p>
I suppose one could have predicted that altered states would not be<br>
massively superior to the standard state, given evolutionary<br>
considerations: if it was easy to change the structure of our minds in<br>
desirable directions, evolution would have made the states switch on and<br>
off appropriately, without requiring vast efforts to achieve them.<br>
