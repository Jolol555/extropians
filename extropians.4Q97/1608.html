The jury is still out on whether chimps can actually use sign in more<br>
than a Pavlovian-Skinnerian associative way.  However, I've no<br>
problem with people doing this.  How many chimps have already<br>
been experimented with?  I doubt the sample is very large due to<br>
the labor and time involved.<br>

<p>
I agree, but no one has argued for confining communication to audio.<br>
And we are definitely not communicating that way now!:)<br>

I think, at best, they are tuned into our emotional states.<br>

This brings us to the sticky issue of what language is.  I don't<br>
want to start a thread on that, but I believe Karl Popper<br>
postulated three levels of language, the lower ones being<br>
subsumed under the higher ones.  The lowest is mere<br>
expression of internal emotional states, like growling when<br>
angry (or, for humans, cursing:).  The next is descriptive, i.e.,<br>
relaying information, such as saying "I am seated in front of<br>
my computer."  The highest is argumentative, which <br>
involves the ability to reason, doubt, and the like, e.g.,<br>
debating the merits of Popper's view of language.  (Can<br>
there be other levels?  Are the levels themselves more<br>
internally differentiable?)<br>
<p>
As a working theory, it seems to show how nonhuman animals<br>
are so different from humans.  They generally are all on level one.<br>
It might be that chimps and dolphins have made it to level two.<br>
So far, only humans are on level three.  (Where do bees fit in?)<br>
<p>
Speaking for myself,<br>
