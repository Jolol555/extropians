Can't agree. I said I didn't like the terminology because it really doesn't<br>
really fit. It was an unsatisfactory ad hoc fill in. When we see that an<br>
infant's urges are absolute directive as opposed to conscious volitional<br>
choice, we're really talking about opposites, not a bridge of identity via<br>
an arbitrarily selected similarity.  An infant may go from is non volitional<br>
to is volitional, but neither condition suggests an "ought." In the infant<br>
stage, the situation is: is non volitionally reactive. In the adult stage,<br>
the situation is: Volitionally active. <br>
<p>

<p>
What do they appear out of? The natural ability to attribute value, right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They are rooted in instincts, and adapted by volition.</i><br>
<p>
Didn't you say one could choose to not go along with what you call<br>
instinctive urges? If this is the case, even if you label some urges as<br>
instictive, if they are overridden by volition, how can they be rooted in<br>
the very thing that volition overrides? Doesn't this place the concept,<br>
instinct, as subordinate to volition?  If this is the case, isn't this<br>
placing "objective instincts" as subjectively alterable, or subject to<br>
dismissal by choice? Doesn't this directly contradict the concept, objective<br>
reality, as not subject to alteration or dismissal by subjective choice and<br>
decree? <br>
<p>
Where are all these contradiction coming from? From what else except absence<br>
of definition allowing the root contradiction to be obscured?  What is this<br>
root contradiction?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If, as you acknowledge, our instinctive urges exist, though we choose to not</i><br>
<i>&gt;be directed by them, why would we define them as not subject to volition.</i><br>
<p>
To the contrary, I made no such acknowledgment. What I said was: &gt;&gt;the urges<br>
in question ARE NOT (emp. added) in the realm of instinct.&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
The whole thing comes down to defining the term, instinct. What is the<br>
term's connection to objective reality? Answering this question clears up<br>
the matter.<br>
<p>
The question to be answered is: Does a term, and definition of it, describe<br>
some aspect of objective reality, or does it create it? Most would balk at<br>
consciously claiming they can create objective reality by words; yet this<br>
claim is implicity incorporated in every argument of the fallacy, objective<br>
value, whatever the manifestation. The acceptance of this fallacy as<br>
"unquestionable truth" is so commonplace and so dominanat in most beliefs<br>
systems that the distortion of language usage needed and used to support the<br>
illusion is not even noticed by the users. <br>
<p>
Let's observe infant animals, human and otherwise, that survive without<br>
conscious effort of plan of action.  Choice plays no part in it. The<br>
reactive entity has no choice. Neither your choice nor mine can change this<br>
natural circumstance. The urges that direct the survival reactions are<br>
inherent in the entities. It is fact that there is no choice in the matter.<br>
To this natural condition, we apply the term, instinct. Ergo, the term,<br>
instinct, by definition, excludes choice. Thus does the definition conform<br>
to reality AS IS. (It would not be opposed to the definition of instinct to<br>
include the natural directive of an individual to pursue what he conceives<br>
to be in his self interest. However, and it a very big however, let us not<br>
forget that what one may conceive to be in his self interest is not an<br>
instinctive reaction.) <br>
<p>
<p>
To speak of urges as instinctive, yet can be followed or denied by choice is<br>
to contradict the definition of instinct. If we have a natural reactive non<br>
volitional circumstance of behavior and apply the term, instinct, to this<br>
situation, can we turn right around and apply the term, instinct, to<br>
volitional determination and have both usages conforming to reality?<br>
Wouldn't this be saying that instinct means non volitional reaction AND<br>
volitional action. In such usage, the term, instinct, does not serve to<br>
differentiate two objectively separate conditions from each other. <br>
<p>
Based on actual definition of the term, instinct, what you are calling<br>
instinctive urges that "impel but do not compel" are not instinctive at all.<br>
If these urges were, indeed, objective instinct, they would compel for that<br>
is the nature of instinct. Other than to seek self interest as one conceives<br>
it to be, the urges may be life oriented or death oriented, thus are a<br>
matter of subjective choice, not objective mandate.<br>
<p>
Since an actual definition connects to objective reality in a<br>
differentiating manner, it simplifies and clarify. Unfortunately (for my<br>
purpose), few are looking for simplification and clarification as it would<br>
expose as false dominanat beliefs they hold as unquestionable truth. Since<br>
this circumstance is commonplace, indeed, nearly universal, one is not<br>
likely to find the truth of definition even discussed in most forums, let<br>
alone practiced by a large number of individuals. Be that as it may, my<br>
analysis and experience leaves me with the truth of it and it has proven<br>
invaluable in literally every aspect of my life. So, rather than abandon it<br>
simply because it is not popular and intrudes upon popular notions, I will<br>
continue to use it to expose a large portion of what "everybody knows" as myth.<br>
<p>
Stepping down from my soap box, let us now take a look at the term,<br>
objective and subjective in the same manner that we examined the term,<br>
instinct and non instinct. I observe things, entities and relationship<br>
existing independently of my mind and independently of my mind to alter the<br>
immutable natural laws that are inherent cause. To this observed condition,<br>
I apply the term, objective.<br>
<p>
I observe that that I and others are human individuals, each with a mind<br>
that is the causal base for conclusions, beliefs and valuations. This<br>
condition of derived from a mind and dependent upon mind, I differentiate<br>
from objective by the term, subjective. <br>
<p>
If these are actual definitions by virtue of describing an immutable reality<br>
of 100% consistency, it logically follows that factual word arrangements<br>
must necessarily reflects these definitions and truth in any and every<br>
usage. If a belief actually conforms to reality, would there be any need to<br>
do otherwise? If this is true, what does this say of beliefs that are<br>
believed and promoted by non definition?<br>
<p>
In examining the phrase, objective value, in reference to definitions, what<br>
conclusion or consclusions logically emerge? If objective means independent<br>
of individual mind, and value is the attributing of worth, requiring a<br>
volitional entity, we arrive at the conclusion of a non individual entity<br>
encompassing the whole of objective reality while attributing value.<br>
Although the foundation premise is false, the formal religious idea of an<br>
omnipotent god's will meets the criteria for the concept, objective value.<br>
We also have "national interest", "values of society", etc. in a long list<br>
of "infinite entities" that presume an all encompassing  non individual<br>
entity as creater and attributor of value in a universal manner. <br>
<p>
There are some who consciously reject "God", "Society", "Nation", etc, as<br>
real volitional things, yet hold to the idea of objective value. The claim<br>
is that the concept, objective value, can be derived from the personal in<br>
reference to the facts of reality. We can see right away that the concept,<br>
personal (subjective) is in direct conflict with the concept, objective,<br>
(independent of personal.) Thus to speak of "objective value" is to say that<br>
the term, objective means independent of mind AND dependent upon mind.<br>
Obviously, the differentiation and definiton is gone and such an expression<br>
or belief cannot and does not conform to reality.<br>
<p>
The usual effort to circumvent this contradiction is the declaration that<br>
one's values may be objective by conforming to objective reality. Thus is<br>
one contradiction invoked as fact to escape another. The contradiction is<br>
that an individual attributing value IS objective reality regardless of what<br>
is valued, or whether it is referenced to fact of fiction.  To be most<br>
direct, one's end chosen is not subject to validation or invalidation no<br>
more that volition itself can be shown to be true or false. One may observe<br>
or demonstrate that a given cause will result in a given effect. This is<br>
objective fact. It has no value in itself, end value or otherwise. It is<br>
only when someone chooses to attribute value to the effect does it become "a<br>
value."  You may prove that selected means (cause) may or may not be suited<br>
to produce a specific result (effect), but by what criteria do you presume<br>
to prove that withholding  valuation or attibuting value to the specific<br>
effect is right or wrong???<br>
<p>
Since there is no such things as objective value, it follows that there is<br>
no such thing as objective morality. Subjective morality? If the "moral<br>
right" and "moral wrong" are not objective, universal and constant, then the<br>
term, morality, must necessarily be referenced to individual. Giving all<br>
equal standing to determine the "moral right" and "moral wrong", the sum of<br>
each conflicting opinion is zero. Ergo, "morality" is myth anyway you slice it. <br>
<p>
Now comes the everpresent and everpresently popular "ought." Objective? Or<br>
subjective? To say it is objective is a direct contradiction of the term,<br>
objective. To say it is subjective, puts it at zero sum in parallel with<br>
"morality."  An "ought" must necessarily refer to what is not. To say that<br>
objective reality IS in conjunction with saying that "ought" (IS NOT) is<br>
saying that objective means both is AND is not. You can't get anymore<br>
contradictory than this.<br>
<p>
To get a handle on the "ought", let's first look at the version found in<br>
formal religion. To say that one "ought" to obey "God's will" is to say that<br>
one can disobey omnipotence. That which is omnipotently and universally<br>
willed must necessarily already exist. If we leave off the "God's will" and<br>
just say objective reality, the same conclusion holds. Its just absent a<br>
named alleged cause. <br>
<p>
The underlying common denominator of all "ought" advocates is the feeling of<br>
obligation that did not come about by individual agreement. The feeling<br>
appears as something inherent in the "nature of man." What an advocate feels<br>
obligated to believe, or do, or feels that others "ought" to do is<br>
referenced to personal beliefs and values. As you have no doubt observed,<br>
there is much conflict between "oughts". This as indicated stems from the<br>
individual nature of "ought". Since it is individual feeling without a<br>
common objective frame of reference by which to peacefully resolve<br>
conflicting opinions, there is always "ought trouble" in River City.<br>
Although the "ought" is myth, it is believed by many to be objectively real;<br>
thus they are directed by principles of mind to heed the "directive ought."<br>
If it is "God's will" or "for the good of the country", there is no limit to<br>
the destruction derived from "ought."<br>
