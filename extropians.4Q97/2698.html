IMHO, I use Creatine myself in my weightlifting - Although Creatine helps <br>
in muscle recover, it does give one's body a _false_ sense of security. You <br>
can push your muscles past their normal recovery period, but you can also <br>
stress them out a lot. Only once, during a set I lost my muscle (i.e. I <br>
could not lift again). It took awhile before my muscle (back) could lift <br>
the heavy weights again that I was training with.<br>
<p>
It would be like any medicine; If your supplement is used wisely, you get <br>
what you want. If you mistreat your body because of them, you can get into <br>
real trouble. I am not enough into sports medicine to think that you my not <br>
die from misuse of supplements though.<br>

Sounds like it.  The only solution is to kill the guardians -- er, the<br>
