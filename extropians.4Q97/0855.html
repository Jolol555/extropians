Hello Extropians,<br>
<p>
In an e-mail conversation with my micro-economics teaching assistant, we<br>
got onto the subject of the inefficiencies of government as a monopolistic<br>
firm.  I am in no way experienced enough to have a sufficiently informed<br>
debate on this topic-- could someone more learned please help me poke some<br>
holes in his argument(although some points of his are very convincing).<br>
Especially, how do I argue against his statement that public healthcare is<br>
40% cheaper than private!?!<br>
<p>
Thanx a lot,<br>
<p>
Geoff<br>

<i>&gt; (p.s.  In using what little economics I have learned so far, I have this</i><br>
<i>&gt; gnawing question which I would like to ask: Isn't the government just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; firm like any other?  It seems to me that instead of using the letter G,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we should use F(EM) for "Firm: Enforced Monopoly."  It appears that</i><br>
<p>
In some sense economists do not differentiate between government and <br>
firms in terms of production.  A hospital is just another firm.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the inefficiencies in government are for the most part caused by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolistic character of the public sector.  Now, you could argue that</i><br>
<p>
A caution here.  It is a misconception that monopolies are always<br>
inefficient or that competition is efficient.  You will learn later <br>
on that efficiency requires that a firm's marginal costs equal <br>
prices.  A monopoly often sets price above marginal cost so is <br>
inefficient.  However, it is not the case that increasing the number <br>
of firms is a good idea since it might cause production costs to rise <br>
(this is the case of a Natural monopoly).  The solution lies in <br>
regulation by forcing the firm to set price equal to MC.  However it <br>
might mean that price is less than average cost and so yields <br>
negative profits.  The solution here is to subsidize the firm so that <br>
profits are zero.  The easiest way is to turn the firm into a public <br>
corporation financed through general tax revenues.  Hospitals for <br>
instance.  Note that Canada offers the same level of healthcare as<br>
the US but at about 40% lower costs.<br>
    Second, there are goods called puplic goods (as opposed to <br>
private goods).  Private firms will generally provide too little of <br>
puplic goods so are inefficient (like say Education).  Alternately <br>
they may offer too much (like pollution).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; a government is not monopolistic because they are numerous on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; wonderful planet earth, but the cost of a citizen uprooting and moving to</i><br>
<i>&gt; another country (and the fact that some governments won't let you move in</i><br>
<i>&gt; or out of their country) makes competition between governments almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonexistant.  My solution: governments that are location non-specific.</i><br>
<p>
There is a model that looks at govt competition.  It analyses "voting <br>
with one's feet".  Individuals move to the jurisdiction that offers <br>
the right tradeoff between services and taxes. (eg Sask, AB, BC).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How we get there feasibly:  I'm not totally sure, but maybe we </i><br>
could start<br>
<i>&gt; hacking up government into a bunch of totally independent agencies(eg.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Canadian Agency of Health Care, Canadian Agency of Enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; Charity(ie. welfare)), then slowly allow competition for each agency to</i><br>
<i>&gt; emerge.  Suddenly, people realize that government really is just another</i><br>
<p>
The issue here is that outcomes are interdependent.  Cutbacks in <br>
healthcare affects the efficacy of social programs.  The issue is one <br>
of coordination.  You will see this point made in the Game Theory <br>
books.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; firm, with all its citizens holding shares, and some crazy politicians</i><br>
<i>&gt; with no business-sense at the helm.  </i><br>
<p>
The view that many economists make is that, yes, governments may be <br>
inefficient but that does not mean that competition can do any <br>
better.  The converse holds as well.  The issue comes down to <br>
figuring out when one form is better than the other and always being <br>
vigilant in pushing for more efficiency, equaty, and fairness. <br>
<p>
Talk to you later   Joel<br>
