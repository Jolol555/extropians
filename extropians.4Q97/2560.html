I don't know who told you that Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. or Mr. Ruger himself<br>
supports the ban on "assault rifles". From the several dozen or so<br>
people I know who know him personally and professionally, and work for<br>
the company in senior management positions, that is not the case. I<br>
would not doubt that, not only in self interest, but in the interest of<br>
the gun using public, the company and the man oppose the widespread<br>
dumping of inexpensive, cheaply made foreign guns on the market, that<br>
are not objects of pride, nor are supported by their manufacturers.<br>
Given that people tend to act more responsibly with something that costs<br>
them something measurable, the idea of dime a dozen zip guns easily<br>
available to anyone at all does not interest me at all, either. As the<br>
old saying goes, you get what you pay for, and an increase in gun<br>
accidents, or an increase in gun use by youths and criminals due to<br>
cheap and easy supply only serve to encourage anti-gunners like HCI to<br>
lobby for ever more fascist legislation.<br>
<p>
The reason that Ruger guns are not classified as assault rifles by govt<br>
is because they follow the law and will only install a maximum of two<br>
accessory items on the controlled list. Sounds like you are getting your<br>
info from somebody with a gripe that they can't buy it from the factory<br>
with as many controlled accessories as they want.<br>
<p>
Ruger IS a stern advocate for gun safety and responsible gun use. They<br>
will offer a gun lock free to any customer who wants one, and users<br>
manuals are also free to anyone for the asking. In today's political<br>
climate such a policy is only wise defensive politics. I can tell you<br>
that Ruger is working to eliminate as much Microsoft software from their<br>
company as possible, due to Gate's support of recent gun control<br>
legislation.<br>
<p>
It is unfortunate that Mr. Ruger's pioneering and prescient policies to<br>
encourage responsible gun use have been painted as anti-gun by the,<br>
shall we say, less responsible gun companies.<br>
