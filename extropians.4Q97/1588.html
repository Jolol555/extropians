<i>&gt;&gt;Yes, but we should realize we are taking on a big responsibility by</i><br>

<p>
Hey, I was only kidding.  Let's say we uplifted dogs and they generally<br>
went into the home and business security field as workers.  So?  Let<br>
them unionize.  If they can do the job better -- more economically<br>
efficiently: the right level of service for cost -- than other available<br>
alternatives, why would this be so bad?<br>
<p>
I'm not sure on the animal rights issue.  I think an uplifted organism,<br>
if<br>
it has a near human level of intelligence should enjoy the same rights<br>
-- individual natural rights in the Lockean-Randian sense, not<br>
collective<br>
or welfare rights a la Rawls or Rousseau -- as humans.  I find nothing<br>
unappealing about that.  It might also serve as a living lesson for<br>
those<br>
ethnocentrists who seek to elevate irrelevant differences, such as<br>
appearance, language or national heritage, to the status of moral and<br>
political trump cards.<br>
<p>
And I would be the first to heartily greet an upliftee to this<br>
discussion <br>
list.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are no significant differences in firing speed, neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;arborization and connectivity as far as I know between different</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;mammals.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure.  I've heard there are measurable difference between firing<br>
speed in humans that seems to correlate with general intelligence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;However, a colleauge pointed out to me that primiates seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to have some very high-frequency cells that others lack that may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;important. But in general relative cortical size and structure seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be more important than the other properties.</i><br>
<p>
This can be found out through research and uplift experiments.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Genetics is probably the way to go, if only to add control genes so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that we can make adult brains grow more or "debug" them, since we </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;want the species to have a heritable intelligence. Hormones and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;surgery can only help individuals.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Increasing the amount of effort and time to growing a larger brain</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; in, say, octopi, might be a good start.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.</i><br>
<p>
But their development cycles are shorter than many other candidates.<br>
This would mean more wetware experiments can be done in the same<br>
amount of time.  (Of course, if we come to a better understanding of<br>
the genetics involved, computer simulations might be the way to go...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Yes, but language is important in order to make the uplifted animals</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;able to communicate with each other, and hence spread their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experiences and memes. It would likely accelerate development just as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it appears to have done in humans.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, but do not want to get bogged down in a we-must-have-them-<br>
talking-English-with-a-Brooklyn-accent-or-we've-failed attitude.  Also,<br>
it might be easier to increase intelligence overall and worry about<br>
language later.  Or the two might be related in such a way that<br>
upgrading one ability feeds into the other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It strikes me that we really need to learn more about how we became</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;intelligent in order to be good at uplifting. But uplifting also gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;us valuable information on how we may have evolved.</i><br>
<p>
It would nice to learn how we evolved, but I don't think it is necessary<br>
to achieve uplifting or augmentation.  Surely, it would help, but one<br>
need not know how the solar system was formed to land on the moon.<br>
