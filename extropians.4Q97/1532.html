<i>&gt; 	Twink &lt;neptune@mars.superlink.net&gt; brought up the great topic</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "uplifting"!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Did you coin this usage of this term or has it been used</i><br>
<i>&gt; before in this way?</i><br>
<p>
I think it was David Brin who invented this use in his Uplift Trilogy<br>
of novels (Sundiver, Startide Rising, The Uplift War), which also<br>
deals with some of its long-term consequences in an amusing way<br>
("clans" of species, very old galactic civilizations, indentured<br>
species etc).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Play God!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Yes definitely!  But shouldn't we be sure we are a good and</i><br>
<i>&gt; benevolent God?  I don't think we should ever only "uplift" to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited degree so that lower life forms can be left as such to only be</i><br>
<i>&gt; our slaves or servants or whatever.</i><br>
<p>
An important moral point. Brin has several alien species in his books<br>
who definitely are less than ideal patrons for their uplifted species,<br>
and a very old system of indenture for uplifted species ("We made you<br>
intelligent, so now you will serve us for a measly 10,000 years, and<br>
then you are free.").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The difference between a dog and us is nothing compared to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between us and a God right?</i><br>
<p>
Ask me when I have uplifted myself :-)<br>
<p>
[Causality Error 437: Message from future. Userid: Anders v45.53]:<br>
You're right, the difference between an unaugmented human and a dog is<br>
trivial compared to the difference between them and a God. However,<br>
the difference between a cat and a God is trivially small. Could<br>
somebody pass me the catnip? :-)<br>
