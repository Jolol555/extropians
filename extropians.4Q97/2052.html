Well, just for noise reduction it is not necessary to oblige one to become a<br>
member of ExI... . A  specific ( and fair..) committee could simply select<br>
those who would have permission to have R/W acces to the list or simply<br>
"read only"...<br>
<p>
Unless the objective of such actions is also getting more funds to ExI... (<br>
what is not reprobable, since we need that Institutions like ExI grow up...<br>
and without money it is very hard for humans...).<br>
<p>
A suggestion for the leaders would be to permit the access of some "invited<br>
members", even if not ExI formal members..., for guaranteeing a higher level<br>
to the list... ( I say that not for me, but for some exponents that will be<br>
simply "discarded"... thrown away from the list... )<br>
<p>
The list, up to know has been just a "free-trial-sample"... Now &gt;&gt;&gt; get your<br>
membership for just $ xxx !!!<br>
<p>
Anyway, it was some interesting to participate of some of the discussions on<br>
the list... But, since I am a Brazilian Sci, with a President (Mr. Fernando<br>
Henrique Cardoso) who says publicly that admires Scientists - but in<br>
reallity, prefers to pay much better to recent graduated lawyers than to<br>
more expecienced doctorated engineers, physics, biologists etc... I just<br>
will say: <br>
<p>
Bye... I suppose I will be transformed, in a near future, in a<br>
"nonvoiced-extropian" !!!!<br>
