<p>
The number of bits in an infinite binary fraction is a countable infinity.<br>
There's a first bit, a second bit, a third bit, etc.  Clearly if you<br>
count them like this you won't miss any.  So there is no question but<br>
that an infinite binary (or decimal) fraction has a countably infinite<br>
number of bits (digits).<br>
<p>
The formula I * I (where I = aleph-null) does not come into play here.<br>
The number of values that can be represented by an n bit fraction is 2^n.<br>
If you are talking about infinite fractions, the number of values is 2^I.<br>
That is the whole idea of the argument - that the number of infinite<br>
binary fractions is 2^I, and that this is also the number of real numbers<br>
in that range.<br>
<p>
So, you need to disagree with one (or both?) of these two points:<br>
<p>
 - The real numbers correspond to infinite binary (or decimal) fractions<br>
<p>
 - The number of infinite binary fractions is 2^aleph-null.<br>
<p>
I don't see how either of these can be wrong.  For the first to be<br>
wrong you'd have to have a real number which did not correspond to any<br>
infinite decimal.  In effect, it would have no value.  This does not seem<br>
coherent.  (In fact aren't the real numbers sometimes *defined* as all<br>
the values taken by infinite decimals?)<br>
<p>
And the second is a simple counting argument.  Of course to go from the<br>
fact that there are 2^n n-bit fractions to 2^aleph-null infinite ones<br>
is a bit facile.  Probably a rigorous mathematical proof would have to<br>
make sure that taking the limit like this made sense.  But certainly we<br>
do this kind of substitution all the time when dealing with infinities.<br>
