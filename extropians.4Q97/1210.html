"Guns have three functions: defending your family, killing delicious<br>
 animals, and keeping the King of England out of your face."<br>
<p>
This week, Homer Simpson bought a pistol ... and folks who enjoy<br>
watching _The Simpsons_ after a day at the target range are<br>
debating in talk.politics.guns what, if anything, it all means.<br>
<p>
Marge tells Homer that she heard on television that a gun in the<br>
house is 58% more likely to be used against a family member than<br>
against an intruder.  Homer is briefly shocked almost into giving<br>
up the gun.  Is the point here that the statistic is accurate and<br>
meaningful, or that Homer will believe anything TV says?<br>
<p>
Lisa (traditionally the social conscience of The Simpsons) says the<br>
Second Amendment is an outdated relic.  Does she favor repealing it<br>
(or wishing it away), or is she merely telling dad that a right <br>
to do something doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea?<br>
<p>
Homer breaks every safety rule in the book, causing Marge to take<br>
the kids to a motel.  Does that mean guns are bad, or is the point<br>
merely that Homer's judgement here is as bad as Homer's judgement<br>
everywhere else?<br>
<p>
Local NRA members are shown as having a creepy obsession with<br>
firepower.  Krusty says, "We need these new guns to hunt the modern,<br>
more advanced animals, like the flying squirrel and the electric<br>
eel."  Moe shows off a shotgun to which he has welded four pistols<br>
(the triggers linked by strings) for a bigger bang.  But then when<br>
Homer uses his pistol to open a beer can, they give him a chewing-out.<br>
Is this a sop to the NRA's tradition of running safety courses, <br>
or an attempt to show shooters somehow as hypocrites or cowards?<br>
<p>
Chastised, Homer goes to make amends with Marge, telling her he has<br>
gotten rid of the gun.  But then Snake (a petty thug) appears, to rob<br>
the motel's cashier, and Homer pulls the gun.  While Marge is chewing<br>
him out, Snake grabs the gun.  Then three of the NRA members turn up<br>
and chase Snake away (without ever firing), having heard the motel's<br>
silent alarm on their police scanners.  Are they good neighbors, or<br>
losers who have no life?<br>
<p>
Finally, Homer confesses that the gun has a terrible grip on him,<br>
and surrenders it to Marge to dump it.  But after Homer leaves the<br>
room, Marge sees her reflection holding the gun, grins, and puts it<br>
in her purse.  Has she recognized that a gun can be a good thing in<br>
good hands (as the foiled robbery shows), or has she, like Homer,<br>
fallen under its spell?<br>
<p>
(In at least two previous episodes, Marge handled a pistol quite well--<br>
but perhaps we're not meant to remember those.)<br>
