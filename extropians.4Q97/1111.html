ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART V<br>
<p>
<p>
ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY SYSTEM<br>
===========================<br>
<p>
by Frederick Mann<br>
<p>
						11/4/97<br>
Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
This is a proposal for an alternative currency<br>
system to be developed, launched, and implemented<br>
as a matter of urgency.<br>
<p>
One of the reasons for urgency is that the<br>
international monetary/financial system could<br>
be a house of cards.  The banksters in control<br>
may be able to prop up the system to recover<br>
from the current "Asian crisis," but they<br>
may not be able to keep their system going<br>
indefinitely.<br>
<p>
I propose that the new system be roughly based<br>
on the ideas of E.C. Riegel as described in 'The<br>
New Approach to Freedom' and 'Free Enterprise<br>
Money.'<br>
<p>
Riegel called this type of system a "split barter<br>
system."  Currently there are numerous "barter<br>
clubs" in operation.  Strictly speaking, they are<br>
generally not barter clubs in that they utilize<br>
some "barter currency" as medium of exchange.<br>
Some call this type of trade "reciprocal trade."<br>
It is characterized by utilizing a medium of<br>
exchange other than those issued by coercive<br>
political agancies.<br>
<p>
This is the fifth in a series of articles on the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first four articles<br>
are available at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
The emphasis of the Economic Means to Freedom is on:<br>
(a) Building freedom, rather than "fighting tyranny"<br>
or "fighting for freedom";<br>
(b) Bringing about a massive shift of economic power<br>
into the hands of individuals.<br>
<p>

and in the Universe to the letter.<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Currency<br>
-----------<br>
<p>
"The pinnacle of power today is the power to<br>
issue money." -- Thomas H. Greco Jr., author<br>
of 'New Money for Healthy Communities' see<br>
Appendix 2.<br>
<p>
The currency of the new system could be called the<br>
"Exchange Dollar" or "E$."  Each member in the<br>
system has the power to issue currency or E$s.<br>
Riegel called this the "individual money power"<br>
-- see Appendix 1.<br>
<p>
Currency is created when an individual wants to<br>
buy something, but doesn't have the necessary E$s<br>
to pay for it.  In this case, a transaction takes<br>
place, the buyer's net balance decreases, and the<br>
seller's net balance increases.<br>
<p>
Currency is redeemed ("destroyed") when a buyer<br>
with a positive balance buys from a seller with<br>
a negative balance.<br>
<p>
A principle of the system is that the total E$<br>
balances of everyone in the system will always<br>
be zero -- the total positive balances always<br>
equal the total negative balances.  Hence the<br>
E$ is inflation-proof.<br>
<p>
The currency is backed by:<br>
(a) An initial 80% guarantee -- see below;<br>
(b) The expectation that those with negative<br>
balances will produce and sell products and<br>
services to eliminate their negative balances;<br>
(c) Default insurance -- see below;<br>
(d) Allowing negative balances based on the<br>
established trustworthiness of debtors -- see<br>
below;<br>
(e) The pledging of assets as collateral to<br>
safeguard large negative balances -- see below.<br>
<p>
For more information on E.C. Riegel and alternative<br>
currencies, see Appendix 2.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. World Business Exchange<br>
--------------------------<br>
<p>
The E$ system is to be managed and operated by<br>
a group of individuals who form a business or<br>
company called World Business Exchange (WBE).<br>
<p>
WBE is responsible for the rules of the system,<br>
managing and operating the system, maintaining<br>
a system to determine creditworthiness of members,<br>
processing transactions, providing default insurance,<br>
etc. -- see below.<br>
<p>
WBE should be "domiciled" in a venue, such as<br>
Belize, which provides the greatest economic<br>
freedom, privacy, and security.  WBE should have<br>
no physical office or assets in its venue of<br>
"domicile." <br>
<p>
<p>
3. Computer System<br>
------------------<br>
<p>
WBE would require a computer system to manage<br>
and operate the system.  Ideally, all transactions<br>
will take place via Internet.  However, it may<br>
be necessary to allow for some transactions to<br>
be manually presented to WBE for processing.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. Initial Value and Guarantee<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
The initial value of the E$ could be set at FRN 1.00<br>
(US$1.00).  During the first six months of operation<br>
of the system, WBE could guarantee that anyone with<br>
a positive E$ balance can exchange those E$s at a<br>
rate of FRN 0.80 for each E$.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. Convertibility<br>
-----------------<br>
<p>
World Trade Clearinghouse (WTC) could be requested<br>
to make a market for E$s.  This would make the E$<br>
convertible into gold, silver, platinum, and the major<br>
currencies handled by WTC -- see &lt;<a href="http://www.wtc-info.com/">http://www.wtc-info.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
[If you decide to open a WTC account, please specify<br>
"AE001" as your sponsor.]<br>
<p>
A major drawback of practically all other "barter<br>
systems" (more accurately called "split barter systems"<br>
or "business trade exchanges") and alternative currency<br>
systems is that their currencies are not convertible<br>
and that some members get stuck with large positive<br>
balances they can't easily spend on products and<br>
services they need or want.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. Interest<br>
-----------<br>
<p>
I propose that interest of one-half-percent (1/2%) per<br>
month be paid on negative balances to WBE, and that<br>
positive balances receive one-quarter-percent (1/4%)<br>
per month from WBE.  WBE thus earns one-quarter-percent<br>
(1/4%) per month on all negative balances.  At the end<br>
of every month, WBE adjusts account balances to reflect<br>
interest payments and receipts.<br>
<p>
It would be desirable for the E$ to not only gradually<br>
rise in value compared to other currencies that are<br>
being inflated, but also to at least maintain its<br>
purchasing power.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. Limits and Defaults<br>
----------------------<br>
<p>
Obviously, a weakness of the system is that someone<br>
can buy products and services, building up a negative<br>
balance, and then dropping out of the system and/or<br>
disappearing.<br>
<p>
For each member of the system, a limit negative balance<br>
can be set, depending on the creditworthiness of the<br>
member.  This limit can be changed from time to time<br>
to reflect the changing creditworthiness of the member,<br>
based on criteria to be determined.<br>
<p>
Rules need to be specified to determine what constitutes<br>
a default.  Members with negative balances are expected<br>
to "pay off" or "produce off" their debit balances over<br>
time.<br>
<p>
Members may "pay off" debit balances by making payments<br>
to WBE in gold, silver, platinum, or major currencies<br>
at rates to be published by WBE on its website, or by<br>
purchasing E$s on the "WTC market," should WTC decide<br>
to make such a market.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. Default Insurance<br>
--------------------<br>
<p>
A negative balance comes into existence when a seller<br>
sells to a buyer who doesn't have a sufficiently positive<br>
balance to pay for the item or service.  The seller is<br>
effectively granting credit to the buyer.<br>
<p>
I propose that default insurance be paid in respect of<br>
any additional debit to a negative balance (i.e., account<br>
becomes more negative) resulting from a transaction.<br>
<p>
Sellers have responsibility in granting credit.  Buyers<br>
have responsibility to eliminate their debit balances<br>
over time.<br>
<p>
I propose that buyer and seller each has to pay deposit<br>
insurance to cover half of the amount involved.  The<br>
rates will be determined by WBE depending on the trust-<br>
and creditworthiness of the buyer and seller, respectively.<br>
<p>
WBE will maintain a fund to cover defaults.  A member<br>
who defaults is removed from the system and the amount<br>
of the default is deducted from the fund.<br>
<p>
WBE may also grant permission to others to provide<br>
default insurance, subject to conditions to be<br>
determined by WBE.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. Credit- and Trustworthiness<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
A formula can be developed based on:<br>
(a) References provided by existing members;<br>
(b) Past performance;<br>
(c) Other criteria to be determined by WBE.<br>
<p>
A trust- and creditworthy index could be calculated<br>
for each member and would be available to other<br>
members.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. Product/Service Listings<br>
---------------------------<br>
<p>
The WBE system would include a "buy register" and<br>
a "sell register" -- respectively consisting of<br>
products/services wanted and products/services<br>
offered.  This would make it possible for buyers<br>
and sellers to link up.<br>
<p>
A classification system will be necessary and the<br>
registers would have to be searchable.<br>
<p>
WBE will charge a fee for listings in the register.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. Transactions<br>
----------------<br>
<p>
When a buyer and a seller agree to a transaction,<br>
each will submit the relevant and necessary<br>
information -- including verification details --<br>
to WBE, wherupon the transaction will be recorded<br>
and the necessary account balance adjustments<br>
made, subject to limits not being exceeded.<br>
<p>
<p>
11. Escrow<br>
----------<br>
<p>
WBE may want to allow for escrow transactions --<br>
see WTC &lt;<a href="http://www.wtc-info.com/">http://www.wtc-info.com/</a>&gt; for examples<br>
of how this might be handled.<br>
<p>
<p>
12. Commissions<br>
---------------<br>
<p>
Barter clubs typically charge a commission of<br>
10 - 15% on transactions.  I recommend that WBE<br>
charge a much lower commission, e.g., 2% - 5%<br>
on the transaction amount paid by both the buyer<br>
and the seller.  There could also be a minimum<br>
commission and a sliding scale depending on<br>
the transaction amount.<br>
<p>
The commission would be higher for manually<br>
presented transactions that would involve<br>
data entry by WBE.<br>
<p>
<p>
13. Membership<br>
--------------<br>
<p>
Any individual, group, business, or company is<br>
eligible for membership, provided they satisfy<br>
criteria to be determined by WBE.<br>
<p>
One of the criteria should probably be that<br>
coercive agencies are not eligible for membership.<br>
<p>
There should be a small membership fee -- maybe<br>
of the order of E$10 per month -- possibly with<br>
discounts for advance payments.<br>
<p>
They could also be different classes of membership,<br>
e.g., a special class for compnanies; or even a<br>
number oc company classes, depending on size of<br>
company.  There could be a range of account classes,<br>
paying different fees and commissions, with different<br>
credit limits, etc.<br>
<p>
(The membership for a company in a typical barter<br>
club is several hundred dollars per year.)<br>
<p>
<p>
14. Simulation<br>
--------------<br>
<p>
A skeleton computer system needs to be developed<br>
as soon as possible, with the various percentages,<br>
fees, etc. as variables.  Then the system needs<br>
to be simulated, using various assumptions and<br>
parameters, to determine workability and<br>
viability.<br>
<p>
<p>
15. Pledging Assets<br>
-------------------<br>
<p>
There needs to be provision for an individual or<br>
business to pledge assets as collateral for credit.<br>
This service could either be provided by WBE, or<br>
by other institutions.<br>
<p>
<p>
16. Privacy and Security<br>
------------------------<br>
<p>
Communication between members and WBE needs to be<br>
encrypted, private, and secure.<br>
<p>
WBE could provide a module enabling members to<br>
communicate to each other via automatic encryption.<br>
(WTC has such a module &lt;<a href="http://www.wtc-info.com">http://www.wtc-info.com</a>&gt;.)<br>
<p>
WBE needs to maintain confidentiality of all<br>
transactions.  WBE needs to be "domiciled" in a<br>
venue that requires no financial reporting.  Thus<br>
WBE will not do any reporting to coercive agencies.<br>
<p>
If any members want to report their transactions<br>
to coercive agencies, that's up to them.  A<br>
potential problem that needs to be catered for<br>
is the eventuality of one party to a transaction<br>
wanting to report the transaction while the other<br>
doesn't.  At the time of entering into a transaction<br>
this issue needs to be settled by mutual agreement.<br>
<p>
<p>
17. Disputes, Mediation, and Arbitration<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
WBE, or one or more other entities, need to procide<br>
for mediation and arbitration services to settle<br>
disputes.<br>
<p>
<p>
18. Additional Features<br>
-----------------------<br>
<p>
The WBE design team needs to analyze current barter<br>
systems, particularly those on the Internet, to<br>
determine what additional features need to be<br>
incorporated in the WBE system.<br>
<p>
<p>
19. Potential Markets for the WBE System<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
(a) Members of other barter clubs (WBE provides huge<br>
advantages not available from the others);<br>
(b) International traders;<br>
(c) People involved in barter and countertrade;<br>
(d) Businesses owned by freedom lovers;<br>
(e) Freedom-loving individuals;<br>
(f) Businesses with "expiring commodities" -- hotels,<br>
airlines, radio stations, restaurants, etc. have<br>
"expiring services" -- if the hotel room isn't rented<br>
in time, the plane seat not sold, the radio advertising<br>
not sold, the restaurant seat not occupied in time, that<br>
potential revenue expires and can never be recovered --<br>
"expiring service" businesses are hot prospects for the<br>
WBE system;<br>
(g) Businesses that would like to have access to an<br>
additional market for their products and services;<br>
(h) Professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers,<br>
accountants, consultants, etc. with "expiring time"<br>
-- if available time isn't being paid for by a client,<br>
the potential revenue from that time is lost forever<br>
and can never be recovered;<br>
(i) People in the alternative currency movement.<br>
<p>
<p>
20. Sales Force<br>
---------------<br>
<p>
WBE would need a sales force.  Sales Reps could earn<br>
a commission, calculated as a portion of the membership<br>
fee as well as a portion of the transaction commissions<br>
of everyone they enroll into the WBE system.<br>
<p>
<p>
21. Growth and Decentralization<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
If the WBE system becomes successful, it will eventually<br>
become necessary to have decentralized local exchanges<br>
in addition to "headquarters."  I envisage that every<br>
sizable city could have its own exchange.  Local members<br>
would be able to access the product/service registers<br>
of other exchanges and transact with anyone else in the<br>
overall WBE system.<br>
<p>
<p>
22. Credit Cards and ATMs<br>
-------------------------<br>
<p>
Once WBE has become a viable operation, it will be<br>
relatively easy to organize the necessary interfaces<br>
with existing systems to enable members to use credit<br>
cards for purchases and to withdraw cash at ATMs.<br>
<p>
<p>
23. Coinage and Banknotes<br>
-------------------------<br>
<p>
I envisage that WBE will not get involved in the issuance<br>
of coins and banknotes, though this option should remain<br>
open.  When it becomes feasible, some group or entity<br>
needs to issue coins and notes representing an honest,<br>
stable, inflation-proof currency.  Ideally, this needs<br>
to be done before current monetary systems collapse.<br>
<p>
<p>
24. Participation<br>

Appendix 1 - The Money Power In You<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<p>
[Extract from E.C. Riegel's 'The New Approach to Freedom']<br>
<p>
There is a treasure buried in your consciousness.<br>
If you will dig it up from the debris of superstition<br>
and fear that covers it you will gain a freedom and<br>
self-mastery that will lift your life to a higher<br>
plane.<br>
<p>
This is the money power in you.<br>
<p>
The power to create money with which to purchase<br>
wealth, health and happiness actually lies dormant<br>
within you.  You have thought of the money power<br>
as something remote from you and beyond your grasp.<br>
You have dreamed of the good you could and would do<br>
if you had money power.  You have blamed others for<br>
not accomplishing this good.  You have blamed them<br>
for evil economic and political conditions; for<br>
unemployment, for poverty, for crime, for war.<br>
<p>
It is quite logical to blame these maladies upon<br>
the malfunction of the money power, but you have<br>
not suspected that the money power resides in you<br>
and because of your failure to exert it the world<br>
is afflicted with miseries.<br>
<p>
You have the power; you have the responsibility.<br>
The power and responsibility to banish poverty,<br>
unemployment, insecurity, misery and war rests<br>
entirely with you.  You, in cooperation with<br>
other intelligent persons, can drive economic and<br>
political evils further and further from the area<br>
of your life and ultimately they may be driven<br>
from the face of the earth.  You can do this by<br>
the money power in you, expressed first in your<br>
own prosperity and happiness, and radiating to<br>
others.  You can do it and you must do it.  There<br>
is no power outside of you that can bring these<br>
blessings to you.  Petitioning the Government is<br>
like writing to Santa Claus.<br>
<p>
You need no laws -- there is a law, a natural<br>
law that governs your money power.  You need no<br>
government aid.  You need only cooperation with<br>
and from persons who, like you, have resolved to<br>
exert the money power inherent in us all.  This<br>
power in each of us needs only the recognition<br>
and respect of our fellows to spring forth and<br>
exert its blessings.  We need not petition<br>
Congress and we need not waste time to denounce<br>
bankers, for they can neither help nor hinder<br>
our natural right to extend credit to each other,<br>
and this is the perfect basis for a money system.<br>
<p>
Banish monetary inferiority from your consciousness<br>
and resolve to exert the dignity, the responsibility<br>
and the power for personal and social betterment<br>
that is rightly yours.  Inspire others to join<br>
these qualities with yours and out of of it will<br>
come mutual action that will realize money mastery<br>
and a richer life in a better world.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
FLIGHT FROM INFLATION: The Monetary Alternative<br>
by E. C. Riegel<br>
<p>
A very well-written explanation of the nature of<br>
money and inflation, has a good short U.S. monetary<br>
history, and calls for a fully-private money system.<br>
This book was well ahead of its time (late 1940's),<br>
and predicted the inflation that has ravaged us since,<br>
and ultimately, the complete destruction of the dollar<br>
[still possible with today's rampant inflation via the<br>
credit markets]. (hardcover) 168 pg. ........ $5.95<br>
<p>
'Flight from Inflation' is also available from Thomas<br>

<p>
NEW MONEY FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES by Thomas H. Greco, Jr.<br>
<p>
This book: <br>
* Is the how-to-do-it manual for local trading systems. <br>
* Describes exchange alternatives which reward people<br>
fairly and reflect the reality of an abundant earth. <br>
* Shows how voluntary groups can revitalize local economies. <br>
* Outlines the true nature of money and new approaches<br>
to transforming money.  New Money for Healthy Communities<br>
takes the reader well beyond the rutted road of orthodox<br>
thinking, describing in detail the essential features of<br>
equitable and dynamic exchange systems, and shows how they<br>
can be set up by voluntary local associations. It describes<br>
both past and present examples of local currencies and<br>
exchange systems, including their strengths, limitations,<br>
and errors. It then proposes innovative ways of transforming<br>
exchange, using mechanisms which are democratic, humane,<br>
ecologically sound, sustainable, and implementable at the<br>
grass-roots level.<br>
<p>
New Money for Healthy Communities is based on thorough<br>
research conducted by the author, a former professor of<br>
business, over the past dozen years. It is well-illustrated,<br>
footnoted, and indexed, and provides extensive lists of<br>
contacts, resources, and references.<br>
<p>
"New Money for Healthy Communities lifts the veil on the<br>
secret power of money creation and lucidly explains how<br>
alternative currencies can give this power back to those<br>
who create wealth. It is destined to be a classic handbook<br>
for community activists and all conscious people." -- Gordon<br>
Davidson, co-author, Spiritual Politics, Builders of the Dawn.<br>
