Hello all,<br>
<p>
I also receive a lot of phone calls regarding polls, credit cards company's<br>
keep track of my spending, All the info regarding tax is kept in a<br>
computer,<br>
etc...................<br>
<p>
Could a solution be, to start spreading Wrong information about,<br>
yourself. I mean to mess up the database files of all these guys.<br>
I work a lot with client-data to sell more and I think a lot about;<br>
if it would be wise to start adjusting information about me. <br>
Like buying at several stores (rich/poor), in polls say sometimes,<br>
I like left and sometimes right, etc........<br>
<p>
Anyone an opinion, does it make sense to do this ?<br>
or will "they" even try harder to find out more about me.<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
