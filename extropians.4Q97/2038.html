        I think that a lot of people have been missing the point toward the<br>
soon to be members-only list.  What the Extropy Institute is doing is<br>
promoting a diversification of ideas as opposed to excluding them.  For the<br>
past year and a half threads have frequently been started about the signal<br>
to noise ratio, list quality, and posting techniques; the result of these<br>
threads have always turned out to be the same: nothing is done about them,<br>
and the list remains as it was.  <br>
        Finally, something is being done about it.  It is unfortunate<br>
indeed that many don't want to or cannot afford the ExI membership, but it<br>
is --at the very least-- a way of giving the list more of a focus.  For the<br>
most part, those who are willing to pay for an ExI membership will be those<br>
who attach a lot of importance to the extropian philosophy...why else would<br>
one purchase a membership?<br>
        It irks me to see plenty of posts complaining about this new move;<br>
at the very least, it will promote a focus.  One of the core values of<br>
extropy is Boundless Expansion...this list has suffered the slings and<br>
arrows of stagnancy and noise-filled posts --this move is an attempt to<br>
expand.  If it does not work, then another method will be tried.<br>
