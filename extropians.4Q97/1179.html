<i>|  CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT"</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800</i><br>
<i>|  inquiry, but it seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me</i><br>
<i>|  to go. CNN is spreading gross misinformation on television,</i><br>
<i>|  indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA 800  was part of</i><br>
<i>|  a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always promoted</i><br>
<i>|  what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile</i><br>
<i>|  theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not</i><br>
<i>|  sufficient to blame the Navy and I wish to move away from</i><br>
<i>|  that and all areas of conspiracy inquiry forever. But I</i><br>
<i>|  never said my inquiries were a "plot" or a "sham."</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to</i><br>
<i>|  ask about my change of direction,  I did not contact her.</i><br>
<i>|  CNN reports now suggest that I said my conspiracy inquiry</i><br>
<i>|  was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do damage to</i><br>
<i>|  the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !!</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit,</i><br>
<i>|  as I have for months, that my inquiry into TWA 800 was</i><br>
<i>|  an effort to identify untruth in the government. I have</i><br>
<i>|  a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian.</i><br>
<i>|  My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal,"</i><br>
<i>|  identifying my bias up front, unlike most sources.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to</i><br>
<i>|  portray it. The fact is that anything that is labeled what</i><br>
<i>|  it is up front is by definition NOT a plot. I'd say CNN</i><br>
<i>|  has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN label</i><br>
<i>|  its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+</i><br>
<i>|  witnesses reported having seen something fly upwards and</i><br>
<i>|  explode at the spot TWA 800 was. That there were such wit-</i><br>
<i>|  nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported in the media.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  CNN just reported in reference to me:</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|      Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife</i><br>
<i>|      and two daughters in the crash, told CNN</i><br>
<i>|      that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana-</i><br>
<i>|      tion to the American public.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I</i><br>
<i>|  did not invent the witnesses. If anyone owes America an</i><br>
<i>|  explanation for the missile theory I think it's the wit-</i><br>
<i>|  nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and</i><br>
<i>|  commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery</i><br>
<i>|  thing shooting up was a Navy missile and the Navy is</i><br>
<i>|  covering it up. I also did not invent the Navy-missile</i><br>
<i>|  theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy</i><br>
<i>|  is known to have many missiles and is known to be off-</i><br>
<i>|  shore where the plane crashed. However, an inventory</i><br>
<i>|  showed that all Navy missiles were accounted for...</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter</i><br>
<i>|  Goelz told CNN that my re-reporting of witness accounts</i><br>
<i>|  and theorizing that the Navy was at fault has done "real</i><br>
<i>|  damage" and "caused innumerable people great agony." Wow!</i><br>
<i>|  It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault</i><br>
<i>|  lies in part and primarily with the major media for ever</i><br>
<i>|  having reported the witness accounts in the first place.</i><br>
<i>|  I then made the mistake of suggesting that the Navy may</i><br>
<i>|  have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see</i><br>
<i>|  as a mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've</i><br>
<i>|  impugned the reputations of America's finest, which is</i><br>
<i>|  something I should not and do not now want to do, and</i><br>
<i>|  for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this</i><br>
<i>|  point I don't care! I just want to be left alone and</i><br>
<i>|  no longer harassed by the major media and others over</i><br>
<i>|  the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it.</i><br>
<i>|  It was a mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have</i><br>
<i>|  "caused innumerable people great agony." I'm a humani-</i><br>
<i>|  tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years because</i><br>
<i>|  I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  I've never published anything I thought was false. I</i><br>
<i>|  even published errata notices when required. All claims</i><br>
<i>|  I've made were meticulously referenced so that readers</i><br>
<i>|  could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing</i><br>
<i>|  not just referenced information and ideas but all the</i><br>
<i>|  links necessary to access the larger body of information</i><br>
<i>|  about the case is what made my reports so popular and</i><br>
<i>|  what made this little guy the focus of world news.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment."</i><br>
<i>|  Wanting to move on from conspiracy theory and set a new</i><br>
<i>|  course, I asked Doctor David Stern, who hosts the DEEP</i><br>
<i>|  TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,</i><br>
<i>|  due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to</i><br>
<i>|  having been engaged in a "plot" and thus that I will-</i><br>
<i>|  fully attempted to mislead people to believe what I</i><br>
<i>|  knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern</i><br>
<i>|  temporarily replace all my reports so that people can</i><br>
<i>|  judge for themselves if I was the liar CNN suggests.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|  It will take David some time to get the reports back</i><br>
<i>|  up, but when they are up you can access them directly</i><br>
<i>|  at: <a href="http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard">http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard</a> or indirectly</i><br>
