Holger, I explained the relationship between transhumanism and extropianism<br>
in my post of 10/30/97. If you didn't receive that message, please let me<br>
know and I'll resend it. Again, in brief: Extropianism in one specific<br>
version of transhumanism. It's specific character is defined by the<br>
Extropian Principles (see our web site at www.extropy.org) There can be<br>
many kinds of transhumanists, all of whom share general goals of overcoming<br>
human limits. They may differ on the best means of doing so, and on what<br>
they emphasize.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would it be correct to say "Extropians are more critical than</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transhumanists"?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think you could say this as a general statement, though sometimes<br>
it will certainly be true. Extropians definitely emphasize critical<br>
thinking (along with creative thinking). This has always been stressed --<br>
see the principle of Self-Transformation (and in the forthcoming version<br>
3.0, see the principle of Self-Ownership).<br>
<p>
We've seen some transhumanists who are not very critical, though this may<br>
be simply their personality rather than an explicit part of their version<br>
of transhumanism. There are people who could be called transhumanists who<br>
apparently do not value critical thinking, and who look to scientifically<br>
implausible methods for overcoming human limits. As our ideas spread, I<br>
expect to see religious versions of transhumanism -- Christian<br>
Transhumanism, Islamic Transhumanism, and (not too far from their current<br>
beliefs) Mormon Transhumanism. Since religious generally promote faith over<br>
reason, those transhumanists will not be as critical as Extropians.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm living in Munich, Germany and am currently trying to find a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;people around me who are open to Extropian ideas for discussion </i><br>
<p>
Sorry we didn't meet when I was in Munich in March this year. I believe<br>
Extropy Institute have a couple of contacts in the area. We would like to<br>
encourage an Institute offshoot there.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
