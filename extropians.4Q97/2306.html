<p>
The site above by John Daly of Australia is a good resource for skepticism<br>
about global warming.  As with any advocacy site (such as the EPA)<br>
you have to take what it says with a grain of salt.  I've gone to the<br>
original article and responses in Nature to get more information.<br>
<p>
The specific point made on the web page above is somewhat misleading,<br>
although the larger point about time spans does seem valid.  Daly shows<br>
a chart representing temperature data from the period studied in the<br>
original paper, followed by another chart showing temperature data for<br>
a longer period.  An upward trend is clearly visible in the first chart<br>
but vanishes in the second.<br>
<p>
The misleading aspect is that it might appear that the first chart was<br>
used in the original paper.  In fact this is not the case.  Daly's two<br>
charts are based on a set of measurements by Angell which cover the time<br>
span from 1958-1995.  The original paper used different measurements,<br>
by Oort and Liu, which cover only a narrower time span.  The original<br>
authors, in their response to the critique, claim that the Angell<br>
data "has instrumental biases and known deficiencies in its spatial<br>
representativeness."  So they did not use that data set supposedly<br>
because it was not accurate enough for them.  In particular, they<br>
did not select a subset of the Angell data and display it, which is <br>
the implication you might take from Daly's web page.<br>
<p>
Actually, the original paper has no charts to show temperature increase,<br>
and surprisingly enough, the original paper is not about warming at<br>
all!  Rather, the paper is looking for changes in the *distribution*<br>
of temperatures by altitude and lattitude.  Global temperature changes<br>
are completely averaged out and discarded in its analysis.<br>
<p>
What the original paper looked at was changes in the distribution of<br>
temperature, based on the data by Oort and Liu.  It does not show any<br>
simple one dimensional graph such as Daly has on his web page.  Instead<br>
there is a two dimensional chart showing temperature change over the<br>
period as a function of lattitude and altitude.  What the chart shows<br>
is that the upper atmosphere has gotten cooler compared to the lower<br>
atmosphere, and that the northern hemisphere has gotten cooler compared<br>
to the southern hemisphere.<br>
<p>
The purpose of the paper was to look at climate models and see if any<br>
of them predicted the same distribution of temperatures.  It appears<br>
that models which include carbon dioxide along with sulfate aerosols do<br>
reproduce the data relatively well.  Adding an ozone contribution makes<br>
the fit even better.  CO2 cools the upper atmosphere and warms the lower,<br>
while the sulfate aerosols are concentrated in the northern hemisphere<br>
near industrial sources, and provide cooling.<br>
<p>
So simple analyses in terms of global temperature changes over the years<br>
in question don't go to the heart of the original paper.  What does matter<br>
is that the differences in temperature between northern and southern<br>
hemispheres also appear to go away when you extend the time frame.  That's<br>
the actual point of the chart shown by Daly, although he doesn't say so.<br>
It represents southern hemisphere temperatures, and their decrease in the<br>
past decade effectivelly eliminates the previous temperature differential<br>
between north and south which the models explained so well.<br>
<p>
In short, extending the time frame causes the measurements to *depart*<br>
from the model predictions, while within the time frame of the original<br>
paper the measurements were becoming *closer* to the model predictions.<br>
<p>
In their response, the original authors admit this.  They don't like the<br>
Angell data, but they use a different set of measurements from Parker<br>
and they confirm that the temperature distributions depart from the<br>
predictions after 1988.  However they claim that this is OK, that some<br>
departures can be expected.<br>
<p>
I didn't find this part convincing.  Yes, broadly speaking there can be<br>
variations, for example if the sulfates get out ahead of the CO2 you<br>
could have some cooling.  But the whole point of their original paper<br>
was the agreement with the models, and even more it was the increase<br>
in correlation between models and data.  Showing that the correlation<br>
immediately turned around and began to decrease after the time span<br>
studied by their paper has to make you question their results.  At a<br>
minimum they have to explain why the models don't predict the temperature<br>
distribution after 1988.  But they don't go into that at all.<br>
