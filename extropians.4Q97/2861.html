<i>&gt;It seems that your definition of "free" lies solely in the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt;bear arms.  I believe this is an extremely narrow view.  Are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other freedoms I mention above worth nothing?</i><br>
<p>
Without the right to bear arms, the rest of the rights are temporary, and<br>
can be withdrawn at any time.  As long as the citizens of a country are<br>
militarily more powerful than the government, that government cannot step<br>
too far out of line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Don't get me wrong.  I don't believe, a priori, that gun ownership is</i><br>
<i>&gt;bad.  As I've said, I've been on a rifle team where strict safety</i><br>
<i>&gt;procedures were taught.  People on this list (including yourself)</i><br>
<i>&gt;have complained how gun owners are often portrayed as madmen.  Would</i><br>
<i>&gt;you complain if, for example, the *only* law that stood between you</i><br>
<i>&gt;and a gun was a requirement to take a safety course?  Would that</i><br>
<i>&gt;be an opprossive law leading to a state that is "obviously not free"?</i><br>
<p>
Such a rule would eventually become oppressive, if only because the<br>
government itself would in time determine the standards for *passing*.<br>
Although such laws are often meant to be protective, they tend to become<br>
a wedge for the introduction of more like them, at least in the US.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[I'm trying to figure out if we're talking at cross-pursposes here,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or if we really do have a fundamental disagreement about what </i><br>
<i>&gt;constitutes</i><br>
<i>&gt;"freedom".]</i><br>
<p>
If you are free only with another's permission, then you are not free at<br>
all.<br>
