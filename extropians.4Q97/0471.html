I'm uncertain what you are saying here.  40% growth every year for 5 years?<br>
 Average of 40% growth every year for 5 years?  40% growth for a five year<br>
period?  The first is excellent ( 40% annual growth ), the second is<br>
average for a good stock mutual fund ( 13% annual growth, compounded ), and<br>
the last is poor ( 7% annual, compounded ).<br>
<p>
40% growth every year is quite accessable if you have a cool head for<br>
investing.  And gives a healthy 500+% return for the five year period as=<br>
 well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For the record, my next strategy (as yet untested - awaiting capital) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) Pick a nascent industry with a potential for stellar growth in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;next 20 years. (E.g., biotech, space exploration, nanotech).</i><br>
<p>
Biotech: Best bet.  Huge growth potential within 10 years.  And plenty of<br>
viable investments to choose from.<br>
<p>
Space Exploration: No way.  There are currently no viable, investment-grade<br>
space exploration companies around...yet.  In 10 years, maybe.  I'd wait<br>
for the market to mature a bit more.<br>
<p>
Nanotech: The potential is starting to emerge, but it may be too early for<br>
small companies trying this stuff to survive.  I actually expect the first<br>
viable proto-nanotech technologies to come from a company like IBM or the<br>
like.  It is simply too expensive for a small company to operate this type<br>
of research without a source of income.<br>
<p>
<p>
[...snip...]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My favorite hidden feature of this strategy is that most of your income</i><br>
<i>&gt;is essentially tax-deferred.=A0 Why?=A0 Because stocks in a nascent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;high-growth industry are growth stocks.=A0 Thus your return on investment</i><br>

<i>&gt;year (and having that compound over a decade), you only lose the capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;gains rate at the very end.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would have to agree that taking advantage of tax-deferred status allows<br>
one to realize a greater growth for less effort, but it also puts a ceiling<br>
on how much growth you can reasonably expect annually.  Going the other<br>
route requires considerably more work (to attenuate the added risk), but<br>
raises the potential (post-tax) growth ceiling by a factor of 2 or 3.<br>
Obviously, the returns have to be *significantly* greater to counter-act<br>
the tax loss.  Of course, the third (and best) option is to invest in<br>
yourself and start your own company.  This type of investment, while more<br>
risky, has a potential annual growth ceiling that positively dwarfs the<br>
growth ceilings you can expect doing any type of investing in the stock<br>
market.<br>
