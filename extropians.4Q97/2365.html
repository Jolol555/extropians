<i>&gt; Basically because the information is transmitted in the form of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; photon, which can't travel faster than light. In the original IBM</i><br>
<p>
	Maybe I've got the wrong idea, but couldn't we use a<br>
photon-pipeline in order to achieve *effectively* FTL communication?<br>
For example, a MIPS Rx000 processor can't really execute a single <br>
instruction in 1 cycle, but using a pipeline, and executing different<br>
parts of several instructions all at the same time, this appears to <br>
be happening. Could a similar process be used for communication,<br>
say, on the internet? Assuming that there is a delay of X seconds<br>
between point A and point B, point A could send a continuous stream of<br>
photons to point B for X seconds before communications are to begin,<br>
and as soon as B receives the first of them, A could start encoding a<br>
message via this quantum "teleportation." Perhaps point A would only make<br>
use of every other photon, allowing for B to use the other "channel." <br>
I guess the big problem here is finding a way for A to store X seconds'<br>
worth of entangled photons while waiting for B to receive the first<br>
of them. So uh... is this plausible?<br>
