[WARNING: The following contains Gross Generalizations.]<br>
<p>
The global warming conference starting Monday in Kyoto has focused a lot of<br>
attention on environmental degradation caused by industrialization in Asia.<br>
 This has lead me to think about a phrase I think I coined and that has been<br>
germinating in my head for a year or so now: "Confucian Capitalism".  That<br>
phrase evokes mixed emotions for me.  On the one hand, I'm glad that Asia,<br>
including China, has by and large rejected its dalliance with Marxism.  On<br>
the other hand, though, I am deeply troubled by the offspring of capitalism<br>
and Confucianism.<br>
<p>
Some elements of the Confucian tradition are fundamentally compatible with<br>
the core values of capitalism; especially industry, thrift and secularism.<br>
 These values have provided a rich cultural seed bed for the development of<br>
capitalist, industrial societies.  Others Confucian values, though, present<br>
very deep conflicts with capitalist values.  At its bedrock level, the<br>
Confucian world view encourages a reverence for static social structures of<br>
authority that is thoroughly inconsistent with the concept of vital<br>
individualism, a multiplicitous polity and a "loyal opposition".  <br>
<p>
The Confucian concept of civil society is strictly hierarchical and does not<br>
encourage individual creative variation from the ideal norm.  In the<br>
Confucian world, industry consists of a vigorous climb up the pre-determined<br>
steps of an established hierarchy.  The sort of "paradigm shifting" lauded in<br>
the creative geniuses of bourgeois culture from Galileo to Gates has no place<br>
in the fixed, linear value system of the Asian orthodoxy.  This is such a<br>
well-established element of Sinitic culture that students of Asian history<br>
come to reflexively associate the word "orthodoxy" with the word "Confucian".<br>
<p>
I believe we can see the effects of the marriage of Sinitic Confucianism and<br>
"western" capitalism in comparisons of the economic and social development of<br>
various Asian countries.  Japan stands out as the most successful of these<br>
unions and its success is premised to some degree on the extent to which its<br>
culture was NOT thoroughly "Confucianized".  <br>
<p>
Japan engaged in a wholesale importation of Chinese cultural structures in<br>
the 8th through the 10th centuries.  However, the Japanese have always had a<br>
flair for maintaining certain indigenous cultural structures, even while<br>
mimicking major elements of foreign social systems.  The Japanese notions of<br>
a feudal blood nobility and the samurai values of bushido ("the way of the<br>
warrior") provided living reservoirs of alternative cultural values that<br>
significantly offset the simple linear hierarchism of classical Confucianism.<br>
 Furthermore, and perhaps just as importantly, Japan's exposure to China<br>
happened to coincide with the flowering of the T'ang dynasty's influence by<br>
Hinayana (and, significantly, NOT Mahayana) Buddhism.  Thus, Japan's history<br>
subsequent to its sinification consisted in large measure of a "multi-axis"<br>
dynamic tension between the individualism of these other cultural matrices<br>
and the social orthodoxy of classical Confucianism.  Upon Japan's exposure to<br>
and subsequent importation of western capitalism, these alternative cultural<br>
paradigms provided a ready source of values that could easily and naturally<br>
be adapted to the individualism inherent in a social system grounded in the<br>
bourgeois values of individual activity and responsibility.  This is not to<br>
say that Japanese society isn't troubled by on-going "cultural dissonance"<br>
between the elements of its Confucian past and its capitalist present; but I<br>
think it explains why in Asia Japan has made the greatest success of adapting<br>
to bourgeois modernism.<br>
<p>
The other "Asian Tigers", geographically and/or culturally closer to the<br>
Confucian core,  have so far not produced societies as able to accommodate<br>
the individualism of capitalism.  Consider the on-going conflict in Korea<br>
between the established power center of state capitalism and the apparently<br>
inexhaustible seed of youthful rebellion in that country's universities.  It<br>
seems that each generation of students in Korean universities engages in<br>
sometimes bloody acts of rebellion, only to be co-opted into established<br>
hierarchy of "Confucian corporate culture".  In Singapore one looks in vain<br>
for even the level of opposition to the status quo one can find in Korea.<br>
 Taiwan, while producing several generations of successful entrepreneurs, has<br>
yet to begin a significant development of polycentric civil society: The<br>
Kuomintang continues to represent the sole vital source of political<br>
legitimacy in that country's public life, despite it thorough corruption by<br>
western standards.<br>
<p>
In light of these ideas, I am not optimistic about the short term for China's<br>
and the rest of Asia's (with the exception of Japan's) ability to come to<br>
grips with the pollution caused by industrialization with current-generation<br>
technology.  More generally, I doubt the conventional wisdom that with<br>
capitalism comes the other virtues of bourgeois society, i.e. individualism<br>
and tolerance for personal diversity.  So long as the established power<br>
structures place a low value on environmental quality and individual liberty,<br>
we can expect no significant SUCCESFUL indigenous protest, but rather what<br>
will be to the West an infuriating willingness to accept a steady rise in<br>
pollution and limits on individual freedom.  Furthermore, the traditional<br>
Confucian disdain for "foreign opinion" will serve to insulate the native<br>
power structures from influence from abroad.  Prescriptions calling for an<br>
internal "free press" will have some impact, but not nearly what would be<br>
expected in Western countries.  The output of such a "free press" will run<br>
into the fatalistic acceptance of the status quo inherent in the Confucian<br>
world view.<br>
<p>
There is perhaps, though, a ray of hope.  Confucian orthodoxy always<br>
coexisted with another tradition; Taoism.  Taoist naturalism was always an<br>
intensely individualistic cultural matrix that was essentially skew to the<br>
mainstream of Confucian culture.  A more or less easy peace existed between<br>
the two cultural traditions because the Taoist ideal of the lone eccentric in<br>
the wilderness had little impact on the settled urban and agrarian society<br>
ruled over by the Confucian imperial government.  In fact, I have always<br>
believed that Taoist eccentricism provided a necessary "escape valve" for<br>
individualism in the Confucian world.  By bleeding off the energies of the<br>
occasional individualist unable to conform to Confucian orthodoxy, Taoism<br>
ironically served as an important element of the stability of the Sinitic<br>
world.  Taoism's stress on a passive internalization of the "Way" ("Tao") of<br>
nature ensured that those unable to conform to the Confucian ideal of a<br>
static social and political hierarchy would not engage in any significant<br>
rebellion against that hierarchy, but rather would simply absent themselves<br>
from it.<br>
<p>
Taoism may provide a cultural avenue for opening up a consciousness of<br>
environmental degradation in Asia and, perhaps, a memetic pathway for<br>
adoption of extropian values.  With its stress on the value of nature, it's<br>
traditions may become the springboard for a wider awareness of the impact of<br>
low-tech industrialization.  Furthermore, the "magical" aspects of<br>
traditional Taoism might well also serve Asia well.  There was a strain of<br>
alchemy in Taoism that could resonate with the development of next-generation<br>
molecular technology.  Perhaps even more promising, the Taoist mages<br>
cultivated magical formulae for life extension, consisting of caloric<br>
restriction and yogic exercises (probably well-grounded in reality) as well<br>
as probably ill-fated programs of experimental poisoning.  Chinese Taoist<br>
lore is replete with legendary figures who achieved extremely long lifetimes<br>
through these practices.  At least in theory, Taoists sought their alchemical<br>
and life-extension goals through careful observation of nature's "way", a<br>
cultural antecedent for scientific empiricism.  Finally, the general Chinese<br>
romance with textual symbolism (almost certainly a function of the<br>
ideographic nature of their written language), provides ample historical<br>
context for active participation in computer science in general and<br>
cryptography in particular.<br>
<p>
All that is needed is an infusion of activism into the Taoist tradition.<br>
 While the notion of "Taoist activism" seems at first like an oxymoron, one<br>
need only look to the Japanese tradition of the warrior-monk to see that such<br>
a cultural construct was at least possible in a closely related milieu.<br>
 While less well developed in the Chinese cultural matrix, the discipline of<br>
"Kung Fu" points at least in part to the individual as the locus of action as<br>
part of a natural process.  At a deeper, philosophical level, extropian ideas<br>
might find a comfortable and fertile marriage with the Taoist tradition in<br>
the natural sciences.  Our stress on values and knowledge arising from an<br>
objective inquiry into the natural world provides a bridge into basic Taoist<br>
thinking.  What is required though, is a means to transmit the insight that<br>
nature itself has given rise to the values of individualism and action in the<br>
world.<br>
<p>
We should be on the lookout for personal bridges into the Chinese cultural<br>
world.  A few billion humans are both a great resource for and a great threat<br>
to our future.<br>
