<p>
<i>        &gt;`Thus when the universe was 1 second old, 1 year old, and 1 million </i><br>
<i>        &gt;years old, its temperature were 15 billion, 3 million, and 3 thousand </i><br>
<i>        &gt;degrees absolute, respectively.  Inserting the present age of the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;universe (t=10^17 sec) [...] we find</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Tpresent = 50 degrees absolute</i><br>
<i>        &gt;which is in reasonable agreement with the actual temperature of</i><br>
<i>        &gt;interstellar space.' (p. 48)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
After finding yet another quote in a book called "The Big Bang" by Joseph <br>
Silk saying that in 1948 a 5 degree K temperature prediction was made I <br>
thought I had you, then I checked your quotation from Gamow's own book found <br>
you were absolutely correct. I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
But not entirely wrong, apparently there was a 5 K prediction made in 1948  <br>
using Gamow's theory, but it was not made by Gamow.<br>
<p>
- From "Exploring the Cosmos" by Louis Berman page 361:<br>
<p>
 "It's [the cosmic blackbody radiation]  possible existence had been first <br>
  theoretically predicted by G. Gamow in 1934 and later elaborated upon by   <br>
  R. A. Alper and R. C. Herman in 1948."<br>
<p>
- From "The Evolution of Radio Astronomy" by J.S. Hey  page 174:<br>
<p>
 "His [Gamow's] research students, Alper and Herman (1949), estimated the   <br>
  residual temperature of the cosmic radiation after expansion at about 5K".<br>
<p>
<p>
- From "Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos" by Dennis Overbye page 132:<br>
<p>
 "In a paper published in NATURE in 1949, two of his [Gamow's] disciples,<br>
  Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman calculated that the present day temperature<br>
  of the universe should be about 5K."<br>
               <br>
Evidently the paper was submitted in 1948 and published in 1949. Alper and  <br>
Herman also predicted that about 25% of the universe should be made of Helium, <br>
and it is.                                     <br>
