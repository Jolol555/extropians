Damien -- I concur.  Would you please post something about your book,<br>
and preferably link to the description from a Web Page?<br>
The only references I could find under AltaVista that included any<br>
kind of description at all were your message to the Extropians list<br>
saying where to buy it and that it was about the Singlularity, and<br>
a paragraph from a literary events zine in Australia,<br>
<a href="http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/news_24/news_003.htm">http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/news_24/news_003.htm</a>,<br>
that said:<br>
<p>
  "Damien Broderick will have two new non-fiction books published this year, to<br>
  follow his novels The White Abacus and Zones. Theory And Its Discontents<br>
  will be published by Deakin University Press. Broderick describes it as a<br>
  critique of some poststructuralist strategies and tactics, with a kind of<br>
  discursive "theory of everything" that tries to link shifts in fashion in<br>
  science and the<br>
  humanities with long historical cycles. His book on posthuman technology and<br>
  the coming singularity, The Spike, will be published by Reed in August."<br>
<p>
That isn't very helpful.  Warning, there was a novel called The Spike,<br>
by Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss, published in 1980 -- you may<br>
want to filter those names.<br>
<p>
BTW, I looked that one up just because I was also curious.  I'm more likely<br>
to try to find information for someone on the Web if that person makes<br>
clear that they don't have Web access or that they've tried looking (and<br>
where) and failed to find the information.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
