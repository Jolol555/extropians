<i>&gt;BTW. I don't think you will find many Europeans on the list, who find</i><br>
<i>&gt;private gun ownership in their countries a good idea. I certainly don't.</i><br>
<p>
However, that's a lot more to do with propaganda than anything else. I<br>
grew up in England as a typical anti-gunner, then started shooting and<br>
talking to shooters and realised that what I'd been taught was just<br>
nonsense. One thing I liked about America was being able to go to a<br>
friend's house and shoot beer-bottles in his garden, without the kind<br>
of hideous paranoia we see in Europe; IMHO it's far more civilised.<br>
<p>
As for gun-ownership I don't own any, but I do have an IPSC Practical<br>
Pistol competition license and would be out shooting if the assholes<br>
in the British government hadn't banned handguns while I was away. Of<br>
course I might do a conversion course and get a semi-auto shotgun <br>
instead; quite why the government considers this less 'dangerous' than<br>
a handgun is beyond me.<br>
<p>
Frankly I consider gun ownership one of the pillars of a free society,<br>
and in the long-term I'll be moving somewhere where shooters aren't<br>
treated like scum. <br>
<p>
BTW, I was highly amused by a radio news report a few days ago that<br>
the government are having a 'laser pointer amnesty' because people<br>
have been using them to dazzle drivers; don't know if they've killed<br>
anyone yet. Looks like British people can't be trusted with anything <br>
these days.<br>
