<p>
Anders? Any other neurologist in the house? How realistic is this?<br>
My mother is suffering from Parkinsons disease (diagnosed in '84) and 8<br>
weeks ago she had a pallidotomy, a surgical procedure were a number of<br>
disfunctional braincells are killed to keep some of the wordt symptoms at<br>
bay (trembling, swaying with arms and legs, variations in body<br>
temperature). Thing are a *lot* better now but it's no cure, we're just<br>
fighting symptoms.<br>
<p>
I've heard of this treatement before but as I understood it didn't look too<br>
good then, long term project. What's the chance that this leads to<br>
practical application within 7-10 years?<br>
<p>
Any info greatly appreciated (by the whole family).<br>
greetings,<br>
