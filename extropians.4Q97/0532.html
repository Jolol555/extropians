I have no clue as to the politics of the SI.<br>

<i>&gt; singularity is not a risk I'm willing to take.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The singularity may very well be catastrophic, rendering all current<br>
politics moot. It may result in any of an effectively uncountable<br>
different horrific outcomes, gray being one of the more comprehensible. <br>
If you have a plan for steering the event toward any particular outcome,<br>
I'd be happy to hear it. I just don't think that radical changes to<br>
the existing economic/political system are relevant.<br>
<p>
Please remember, I advocate actively attempting to advance the<br>
singularity<br>
by continuing technological advance. This has the advantage that if<br>
I'm wrong and there is no immediate singularity, we still get the<br>
advantage of the advance. This is one reason I continue to go to<br>
work every day and attempt to forward the design of new and better<br>
integrated switching equipment and enhanced heterogeneous routing<br>
algorithms, instead of retiring or working in marketin g.<br>
