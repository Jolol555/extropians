<p>

<p>
Yes, I agree. Those four lines I posted were confused and I <br>
appologize for my mistake.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Extropianism is defined by the Extropian Principles. Those principles do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not -- and never have -- included libertarian, and certainly not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; specifics of anarcho-capitalism, as defining ideas. The Principles convey</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain shared attitudes and values that make one an extropian, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific beliefs about the best organization of political or economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutions. </i><br>
<p>
Not even the belief that something broadly like libertarianism is a <br>
good thing? There has been some debate on whether this list is an<br>
appropriate forum for discussing "basics", and I got the impression <br>
that this in practice ment arguing about the merits of <br>
libertarianism. I think several people scolded Erik Moeller about <br>
that about half a year ago, though I didn't follow the thread very <br>
closely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Certainly, you cannot uphold Spontaneous Order while</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanting an all-powerful state that directs all activity centrally</i><br>
<p>
As a clarification: Could a person who held the following belief be <br>
an extropian: "The likely only way to avoid a nanotechnological <br>
disaster ending life on earth is if there is a world-wide <br>
dictatorship, where the dictator coerces people into following his <br>
will. So I believe in dictatorship and coercion"?<br>
<p>
Anyhow, I now think the following is an accurate statement of <br>
the difference between transhumanism and extropianism (though perhaps <br>
not one that is very useful for newbies):<br>
<p>
Extropianism is transhumanism plus the claim that the Extropian <br>
Principles (by Max More) are right. Thus you can't be an extropian <br>
without being a transhumanist, but you may be a transhumanist without <br>
being an extropian.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are people who could be called</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanists who apparently do not value critical thinking, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;who look to scientifically implausible methods for overcoming human</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits. As our ideas spread, I expect to see religious versions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism -- Christian Transhumanism, Islamic Transhumanism, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;(not too far from their current beliefs) Mormon Transhumanism.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree. As you wrote yourself in the Extropian Principles 2.6:<br>
<p>
"transhumanism values reason and humanity and sees no grounds for<br>
belief in unknowable, supernatural forces externally controlling our<br>
destiny"<br>
<p>
Therefore I don't think that christians, muslims or mormons could be <br>
transhumanists. I think we should rule that out in our definition of<br>
the term "transhumanism"; otherwise the concept of transhumanism <br>
degenerates into:<br>
<p>
transhumanism = extropianism - balls&amp;brains<br>
<p>
which I strongly object to! While I favour keeping the concept of <br>
transhumanism rather open and inclusive and a bit vague, I think it <br>
is memetically useless to define it as, say, "any doctrine that we <br>
can (and should) overcome our biological limitations" without making <br>
any reference to technology or anything that sets us apart from all <br>
those religious people who believe in an afterlife or whatever. We <br>
need a general term to denote people who think *like us* (whether <br>
more specifically we are extropians or not), and "transhumanism" is <br>
the best such term we have.<br>
<p>
"Islamic Transhumanism" is comparable to "Christian Science".<br>
