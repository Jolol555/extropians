<i>&gt; Strictly offhand, just extrapolating from those instances of Algernon's Law</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been able to find, I would guess that ampakines disenhance</i><br>
<i>&gt; linear/sequential event memory and temporospatial solutions (catching a ball).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Did they try testing for that?</i><br>
<p>
They tested a digit cancellation task (cross out as many instances of<br>
'1', '4' and '8' from a sheet of random digits, as accurately and quickly<br>
as possible) and a finger tapping test (tap with the right index finger,<br>
tap with the left, alternate index and middle fingers, alternate<br>
left and right index fingers; the speed of tapping and correctness was<br>
measured). Neither of these had any significant deviations from the<br>
untreated subjects. There was a *tiny* (non-significant) decrease in<br>
the finger tapping task, but not enough to support your above idea.<br>
Of course, these were just two rather simple tasks. <br>
<p>
However, my guess is that ampakines have some kind of drawback. They<br>
seem to make the postsynaptic signals stronger in many neurons, which<br>
may lead to problems with overstimulations (I think they are bad for<br>
epileptics). Also, an increase in neural plasticity is not 100% positive.<br>
If you learn easily, you will also easily erase old information; your<br>
memory range may get shorter. I'm not sure yet if the ampakines mainly<br>
act in the median temporal lobe (in that case they might make your<br>
learning more selective) or in the cortex (in that case they might make<br>
you forget old memories faster while you learn faster). We'll see...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A 10-20% improvement may be indicative of cognitive resources being entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; focused on a single class of problem.  This may or may not be worth the likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; 30-60% disimprovements in cognitive areas outside the narrow ones studied.</i><br>
<p>
So far we have not seen any evidence for disimprovements; my guess is<br>
that the effects are a bit more subtle than a simple decrease in some<br>
other ability; I would say the expected result would be a shift in the<br>
balance between different cognitive abilities (such as learning/forgetting<br>
and stable storage). <br>
