<i>&gt; &gt; Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; remarks</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Of course, the most important</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;question for people to think of is how to be needed. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hmmm Anders, you may well go down in History for that quote ( I hope</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its yours :)  )Never before has such an apparently inocous and simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; statement had more momentous implications.  </i><br>

<i>&gt; Thanks! </i><br>

	Needed for what?  What is it that is "over" in 50 years?  Is<br>
there some God or machine or something that will kill us because we<br>
are not "needed"?  Why?  This all seems bassed on completely backwards<br>
assumptions and absurdities.  We are the ones that have need aren't<br>
we?  Not the other way around or not something that needs us!?<br>
<p>
	In a world of plenty there is plenty to fulfill all needs.<br>
There will be Gods and machines just waiting to do whatever it is each<br>
and everyone on of *US* needs, whatever we are and whatever we freely<br>
decide that we need.<br>
