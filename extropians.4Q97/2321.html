I don't think thin-film PV arrays need to generate significantly more<br>
waste than production of an equivalent floatglass surface. Silicon is<br>
anyway not a good substrate for them.  (There _is_ a reason for Silicon<br>
Valley's massive environmental load). <br>
<p>
If people refer to monocrystalline GaAs or Si arrays, that's their<br>
problem. (One can also make diamond wafer PVs. Of course one could also<br>
drive an ICU with diamond dust). <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Electric vehicles are, in total, around 45% efficient on average, while</i><br>
<p>
There are motors exceeding 95%, controllers in &gt;90% and fuel cells in &gt;60%<br>
range (theoretically, efficiency could also lie in &gt;90% range). Regen<br>
braking quantitatively reuses braking energy. No transmission is required<br>
for a motor-in-wheel concept. Spike cache allows to reduce peak motor<br>
performance significantly. Design synergies allows elimination of a large<br>
number of dead weight, which allows drastical reduction of peak motor<br>
performance. (Of course I am talking composite frames here. Why bothering<br>
sticking modern tech into a rusting Packard hulk?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Internal Combustion vehicles are 18% efficient, on average. This is a</i><br>
<p>
Fuel cell's exhaust is just carbon dioxide and water. It is physically<br>
impossible to optimize ICUs into a clean burn. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; comparison of only the engine, power source, power train, and rolling</i><br>
<i>&gt; and aerodynamic friction. When Power plant efficiencies are figured in,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it comes out that EVs are on average 3 times more energy efficient, and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including power plant emissions, 33% cleaner than current IC technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (of course, this fails to measure emissions of oil refineries, hint</i><br>
<i>&gt; hint)</i><br>
<p>
All this does not include a high-performance carbon-frame lithium-ion EV<br>
charged of an PV array. Novel designs involve supercapacitors both for<br>
main and spike storage.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Once this is determined, one then evaluates the economic value of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits, and weighs them against the drawbacks, like decreased range,</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed, safety, and user time wasted waiting for charging, and the higher</i><br>
<p>
Due to synergistic effects the range is higher (at least twice range),<br>
travelling speed is equivalent or higher, peak performance significantly<br>
higher, safety significantly higher (there's a reason Formula I cars have<br>
composite frames), recharging of a battery-swap EV (most EVs recharge<br>
overnight or at work since used for commuting) or a fuel-cell vehicle<br>
equal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; cost to purchase a vehicle. </i><br>
<p>
Costs are significantly higher. Should be somewhat cheaper, if mass<br>
produced. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I think that if all a driver needs a car for is to commute</i><br>
<i>&gt; 50 miles or less each day (as is the case with 80% of American workers),</i><br>
<i>&gt; then an EV makes sense. If one hopes to use a car for any recreational</i><br>
<i>&gt; purposes, however, an EV is not a good idea. An EV may be a good choice</i><br>
<i>&gt; for one vehicle in a two vehicle household for weekday carpooling.</i><br>
<p>
Currently, yes. If their potential is properly developed, EV significantly<br>
outperform modern ICEs in all respects. And if you really want hovercars,<br>
you can always use microturbine arrays. <br>
<p>
The reason why we don't have (fuelcell)EVs today are past and current<br>
marketing decisions.<br>
