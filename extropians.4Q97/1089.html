"No more than" is a bit strong.  But I think most economists <br>
and political scientists would agree that information dymamics <br>
are near the center of most interesting questions. The <br>
big change is that now, 52 years later, we have powerful tools <br>
for studying these information dynamics. Most of my study and <br>
research has been into various types of information processes, <br>
and very little has been in supply and demand type reasoning.  <br>
And I am far from unusual.  <br>
<p>
Critiques of economics for neglecting the "problem of knowledge" <br>
are somewhat like critiques of engineers for neglecting <br>
computers, or critiques of biologists for neglecting DNA.  <br>
They may have been valid in 1945, but hardly today.<br>
