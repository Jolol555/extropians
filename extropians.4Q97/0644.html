This strikes me as a misconception (so to speak), although an extremely<br>
pervasive one.  On the face of it, the growth cycle for a perfect 16 year<br>
old young adult human body is 16 years.  And it's hard to see how that can<br>
be achieved without all the sensorimotor interactions a conscious person<br>
has with the rich physical world, and with other people.  The comic book<br>
picture of healthy and muscular bodies growing suspended in fluid, ready<br>
for cropping and transplantation, is entirely unhooked from everything we<br>
know about mammalian developmental processes.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the real kicker in the headless frog embryo story is the<br>
informed suggestion that we are nearing the point where functioning organs<br>
can be cultured without requiring a whole body-brain complex to support<br>
them.  I don't see why this should be done drastically faster in vitro than<br>
a body does it in vivo, but maybe there are ways to tweak the cycle if a<br>
complete body isn't needed.  Other mammals grow big and strong far faster<br>
than we do, so maybe the latency plateau can be bypassed in decorticate<br>
preparations.<br>
