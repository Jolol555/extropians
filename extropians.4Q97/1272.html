  [ Note from Tony Hollick: after this column  was published (under the -- <br>
  hopefully! -- last British Tory Government), the author Jane Affleck's <br>
  disability payments (which she has to have, so as to _survive_), were <br>
  summarily cut off, without any explanation.<br>
<p>
  Several nerve-wracking months later -- which further damaged her health <br>
  quite badly -- an Appeal Tribunal took about ten minutes to restore <br>
  them. She hasn't written since, but may hopefully resume her invaluable <br>
  activities soon ].<br>
<p>
  The head of the Social Security Office told me that it's more than her <br>
  job is worth, to discuss 'outside intervention' from MI5 in stopping <br>
  Jane's payments.   How many other writers and activists have been <br>
  subjected to this sort of thing in the 'United Kingdom'?  A Public <br>
  Inquiry is in order...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
  'Coincidentally', six LOBSTER contributors and/or writers (including <br>
  yours truly, Tony Hollick), were all 'targeted' at around the same time.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Yet another (occasionally somewhat OTT) writer who was critical of <br>
  SEARCHLIGHT Magazine, which is edited by the infamous Gerry Gable, and <br>
  which manages to combine communist loonies, fascist loonies, and MI5, <br>
  the -- inaptly-named -- 'British Security Service' -- aka 'The Tory <br>
  Party in Fancy Dress'), had his benefits summarily stopped.<br>
<p>
  He complained rather too vigourously, and was promptly arrested, jailed <br>
  for 'threats to murder', had his computer seized, was held on remand for <br>
  months on end, and was eventually put on trial on trumped-up charges.<br>
<p>
  The Court found him 'Not Nuilty.'  He's now collecting damages...<br>
<p>
<p>
  At the time, MI5 was controlled (if at all) by the even more infamous <br>
  Michael Howard, an authoritarian Tory politician and lawyer.  If _any_ <br>
  British Conservative _ever_ has the sheer damned effrontery to prattle <br>
  on to you about how the Tory Party stands for 'freedom', tell them to <br>
  shove it _right where it hurts_...<br>
<p>
  The Tory Party _actually_ stands for a 'Crony-Capitalist' hierarchical <br>
  authoritarian society where around ten thousand people want -- and <br>
  expect to get - nothing much,  except all the land, all the pwwer and <br>
  all the money.  Oh, and a grotesque and morally filthy past, which <br>
  happens _over and over agoain_.. -TH ]<br>
