The jury is still out, but my focus is on octopuses now.<br>

I don't really care about public outcry.  A lot of this uplifting work can be<br>
done underground.  I am more worried about the moral issues because<br>
I do think there is an objective right and wrong.  I'd also hate to be<br>
involved in creating hopeless monsters.<br>
<p>
I fear no matter how many scruples we have, the technophobes will<br>
protest and have the numbers.  I was thinking of presenting them with<br>
a fait accompli.  If we can uplift octopuses -- create "sophoctopoda"<br>
as Sandberg dubbed them -- then they, and everyone, would just have<br>
to accept it.<br>
