&lt;&lt;The spatial geometry of a closed universe is at a given time<br>
equivalent to a three-sphere (S^3): it is bounded, the integral of the<br>
volume of space exists and is finite and it has no "edges" (if you<br>
move straight forward in any direction you will eventually end up<br>
where you started).<br>
<p>
I don't see why people have any problems with this. :-)<br>
<p>
[While I'm at it, and cutting and pasting equations from Dyson, the<br>
metric of an open universe is<br>
<p>
ds^2 = R^2 [dpsi^2 - dchi^2 - sinh^2 chi dOmega^2],        <br>
<p>
where <br>
<p>
t = T_0 (sinh psi - psi),  <br>
<p>
R = c T_0 (cosh psi - 1),  <br>
<p>
and 0 &lt; psi &lt; infinity 0 &lt; chi &lt; infinity. This universe lasts forever<br>
and has infinite volume.]&gt;&gt;<br>

   "If you move straight forward in any direction you will eventually end up<br>

   "This universe lasts forever and has infinite volume."<br>
   I just wanted to put your two statements in close proximity so perhaps<br>
you could see the foolishness of your argument. Please tell me how I<br>
end up where I started in infinite volume. Actually, don't bother. Physicists<br>
have been using all sorts of incredible equations to justify and rationalize<br>
their feelings and mystical philosophies from the first day they were able to<br>
and it would be painful for me to watch a man of your intelligence continue<br>
in this tradition. My hope is that you will research Objectivist Epistemology<br>
and<br>
recognize it as a powerful immune system for your brain and implement it<br>
so you can go on to apply your admirable mental capacity to challenges that<br>
will increase your happiness(and of course my selfish reasons are to benefit<br>
from the products or services of a happy, rational person that will be so<br>
valuable in a free society--should we ever see a free society on earth.)<br>
