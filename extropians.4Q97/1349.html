Steve Witham:<br>
<i>&gt;Some recent (&amp; controversial) survey said that around the world, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;*women* are reasonably educated, they decide how many kids to have based</i><br>
<i>&gt;on fairly rational estimates of the economic prospects for the kids.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, this study wasn't so controversial, as it was commissioned <br>
by a global development agency.  The applied results (e.g., the <br>
ability of the women to control the number of children they birth) do <br>
depend, however, upon reproductive technology, an area that even the <br>
pharmaceutical companies admit has fallen into neglect.  It can be <br>
pointed to as an example of technology that has been suppressed due to <br>
the imposed moral standards of non-users.  (it's also an area of <br>
technology that the neo-Luddites have long fought for in connection <br>
with human rights.)<br>
