Harvey: We recently did an exchange with the Bionomics Institute through<br>
Cato. We figured plenty of our members would welcome info on the last<br>
Bionomics conference. Michael Rothschild was an extremely popular speaker<br>
at EXTRO 2. We have also exchanged local N. Cal mailing lists with<br>
Resources for Independent Thinking. RIT's Pres. is Sharon Presley, who is<br>
an ExI Advisor.<br>
<p>
If you prefer to be excluded from all exchanges of mailing lists, we will<br>
gladly accommodate you.<br>
