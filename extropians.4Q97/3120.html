Hmm, I don't seem to have made myself clear.  I have no objection to<br>
your whipping us up into moral action; what I object to is the<br>
nonsensicality of the concept "social justice" to describe what you are<br>
aiming for as a result of all this social action.<br>
<p>
The result you are after - that we all get together and do something<br>
about our less fortunate fellows - that's fine.  However, to describe<br>
this as bringing about a form of "justice" seems to me to be daft: since<br>
the distribution of goods is largely accidental, ie. nobody is to<br>
*blame* for it, how can it be a matter of *justice*?<br>
<p>
In fact doing so obscures the morality of helping.  Instead of an act of<br>
charity, we are to call our giving of aid an act of *justice*? <br>
Puh-leez.<br>
