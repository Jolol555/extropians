Whether it is a good move for ExI remains to be seen (but I don't imagine, Max,<br>
that you'd consider it if you thought it wasn't. &lt;grin&gt;).<br>
<p>
However, I do see this as a smart move allowing only people who have made a pledge<br>
to the Institute to have the right to post freely on an Institute list (which is<br>
set up for the express purpose of fleshing out the Institute's memotype.) One<br>
thing I have noticed in my time here is that discussion occurs on the whole range<br>
of transhuman topics, whether specifically extropian or not. This is not<br>
necessarily a problem, but very little reference is made to the more specific<br>
tenets of extropy (i.e., the principles). If a goal of the list is to "share" some<br>
of the load on Max by promoting the cultivation of new *EXTROPIAN* ideas, the<br>
current setup is failing at that.<br>
<p>
BTW, there is a general transhuman list already --<br>

<p>
The current discontent over the membership proposal may be a sign that most<br>
people's interest is in the broad transhuman philosophy, and not specifically in<br>
extropianism. Admittedly, I've been putting off a student membership for several<br>
months now. But one thing is becoming clearer to me: whether or not I agree with<br>
everything ExI has stated in the Extropian Principles, there is no other<br>
transhumanist organization as firmly established as ExI, and doing the amount of<br>
work ExI seems to be doing (CM if I'm W -- Aleph?). Even though some aspects of<br>
spontaneous order suggest a broad politic that I'm not ready to accept, I see no<br>
need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.<br>
<p>
Given that I have no time/motivation to start an organization on my own, a<br>
membership in ExI will accomplish a few things for me.<br>
<p>
1. It will give me a concrete hand in the promotion of transhumanism.<br>
2. It will (now) allow me participation in a list that I *already* look forward to<br>
sifting through everyday.<br>
3. It will allow me to debate the Extropian principles with a little more<br>
leverage.<br>
<p>
Purchasing a membership in ExI does not mean:<br>
<p>
1. I think ExI is the final word on transhumanism.<br>
2. I am a libertarian, or<br>
3. I will be a member next year.<br>
<p>
In short, there is work to be done, and ExI is shouldering a good part of the<br>
load. I think we all need to decide why we don't want to join, and work those<br>
things out for ourselves. Some may think they don't know enough about the<br>
organization. Hey, that's what this list is for. Ask some questions, ask Max. I,<br>
too, am very careful about my affiliations and their impact on my career. There's<br>
nothing wrong with that. But, if you're a transhumanist, and you think that<br>
transhumanism needs to pick up some steam, then a contribution to some<br>
organization seems like a good next step. Some people, like Broderick, are already<br>
doing their share by themselves, and we need more and more people like that, too.<br>
Living in the States, and given that I don't have the expertise to write _The<br>
Spike_ or something similar at this point, I think ExI could use my help.<br>
<p>
That's all,<br>
