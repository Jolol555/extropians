<i>&gt; Australia seems to be the world capital of hard extropian fiction: Greg</i><br>
<i>&gt; Egan, plus Vinge lets it be a world power in a couple of short stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; (although only because the North had nuked itself and the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; South had burned its libraries in panic.)  And you perhaps, although I</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't read any of your books.  Any basis for this in real life?</i><br>
<p>

I wrote an essay on the development of an information society and economy <br>
in Australia which can be found at:<br>

<p>
As a culture we have certainly been one of the fastest in the uptake and <br>
application of information techonology, most likely due to our remote <br>
geographic location and sparse demographic. This may help to explain <br>
why Australian writers have a good turnout of Extropian fiction.<br>
<p>
I am very new to Extropian ideas, and am in the process of gathering for <br>
myself various books and essays to read. I assume you are referring to <br>
Vernor Vinge above? I have read some of William Gibson's work, which I <br>
thought was great, and am looking for some good non-fiction. Is Moravec a <br>
good place to start? I have read some of his essays...they're excellent.<br>
<p>
As an aside, when I first read the name Damien Broderick I was racking my <br>
brain to try and remember where I had heard the name. When he posted to <br>
this list I remembered (I think). Damien, you're the author of Spike <br>
right? I heard the beginning of your interview on JJJ driving to work <br>
earlier this year, and have been planning to get the book. So G'day from <br>
a fellow Aussie!<br>
