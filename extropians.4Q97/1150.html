<p>
You should be aware that many cypherpunks are not motivated simply by<br>
some kind of privacy fetish.  There are a couple of practical motivations.<br>
<p>
One is fear that without cryptographic assurances, virtually all privacy<br>
will be lost.  We are moving down a path towards a surveillance society,<br>
in which all our purchases, hobbies, subscriptions, and activities are<br>
recorded by others.  As more transactions become electronic it will<br>
become that much easier to achieve this.  Super-databases will come into<br>
existence which integrate the disparate data from your video downloads,<br>
your on-line payments, your web surfing habits, into a complete dossier<br>
on you.<br>
<p>
Another motivation is the belief that crypto technology could increase<br>
options for voluntary interactions and reduce the impact of coercion.<br>
It is hard to enforce a minimum wage law when the two parties interacting<br>
know each other only by crypto pseudonyms and payment is made by<br>
untraceable, anonymous electronic cash.  Likewise many other kinds<br>
of laws where third parties try to meddle in voluntary interactions<br>
could be thwarted by the availability of strong cryptography.  In fact<br>
some libertarians predict that crypto will bring about the collapse of<br>
the state, as most commerce moves into untraceable electronic forms,<br>
depriving the state of tax revenue.<br>
