<i>&gt;But: if you'd had a rocket-platform on the top of this structure,</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't it easier then to go into orbit ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also since, it's space, can't you just build on. Ok, it's a long way</i><br>
<i>&gt;but in space the structure doesn't have a lot of forces to take on.</i><br>
...<br>
<i>&gt;Maybe I'm not seeing this right: But isn't it the problem to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;away from the gravity of earth that usses all the energy. </i><br>
<i>&gt;And therefor it's so expensive to go to space ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;My simple idea, is just to get an elevator to space (100 km ?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;This wil give you a road to space, by wich you could ship parts to</i><br>
<i>&gt;this height. Build rockets/sun-sails/etc.. on top and work from there.</i><br>
<p>
I think I see the misconception at work here; it is a common one.  <br>
<p>
The Earth's gravity does not stop just 100 km up.  It goes out forever,<br>
growing weaker with distance.  It declines as one divided by the square of<br>
the distance from the center of the Earth. We call the gravity 1 g at the<br>
surface (6400 km from center) so at 100 km altitude (6500 km from center),<br>
it is still .97 g (this is (6400/6500)^2).  You could probably not even<br>
notice the difference in gravity if you stood on a 100 km high platform.<br>
<p>
What keeps satellites in orbit is not that they are beyond the reach of<br>
gravity, but that they are going sideways very fast.  Like anything thrown<br>
sideways, their path bends downwards as they begin to fall.  However, they<br>
are going so fast that after they have fallen 1 km, the earth below them<br>
has receded more than 1 km becuse of its curvature.  So they keep falling<br>
toward the Earth, but missing.<br>
<p>
What I said in my original post is that it is much harder to get enough<br>
sideways speed to get to orbit than merely to get to 100 km of height.<br>
