Although... if I launched parallel threads to write messages, terminating<br>
the threads on completion of each task... years and millions of messages<br>
later, I'b be no better at writing messages. Since none of the writing<br>
experiences would be with my core thread, I might even be progressively<br>
worse over time.<br>
<p>
Also, if I (as a a sequential thread) were to consider a given task fun or<br>
interesting I would want to undertake the task myself (no forking),<br>
experiencing and reinforcing the activity, thereby changing my internal<br>
state. Naturally, I would want to fork parallel threads to complete less<br>
interesting tasks, and optionally terminate the threads upon completion.<br>
For a single long-lived thread I think over-specialization could occur as<br>
the "interesting" tasks were pursued, experienced, and reinforced... and<br>
other less interesting tasks were delegated. The problem is that the forked<br>
parallel threads would be progressively specialized as well and would be<br>
increasingly ineffective/inefficient at caring out the less interesting<br>
tasks. Many self-directed threads would come to rely on foreign threads for<br>
those tasks they could no longer perform efficiently (so a market for<br>
services would have to exist... and a currencies).  Many specialized<br>
threads would frequently dead-end in their usefulness and expire. The<br>
catch: the highly specialized threads would be the most efficient at<br>
performing a given task. Ouch. The super-specialized threads might be<br>
narrowly focused enough to be considered non-sentient automatons.<br>
<p>
Launching and terminating threads to carry out certain tasks presents some<br>
interesting possibilities. One application of this would be in generating<br>
self-diagnostics. You could submit your forked copies to a battery of<br>
tasks/tests and analyze the outputs to quickly identify areas that require<br>
improvement, for example.<br>
<p>
Other things come to mind, but I'm getting way out on a limb here.<br>
