<p>
Even if these technologies are invented, how does Brin propose to prevent<br>
the following things from happening?<br>
<p>
1. Privacy becomes more costly so only the rich and powerful will have<br>
privacy. They will be able to afford private messenger services, houses in<br>
the country, bug-proof offices, etc.<br>
<p>
2. Those who control the surveillance technology/infrastructure will use<br>
it for their own purposes instead of giving it away to everyone. Are we<br>
supposed to expect the government to install all these cameras and then<br>
allow everyone to use them? Who is going to pay for all of the<br>
cryptanalysis and why would they then give away the plaintext?<br>
<p>
It seems to me advocating a transparent society has the effect of making a<br>
surveillance society much more likely while not greating affecting the<br>
likelihood of a transparent society which is very small to begin with. <br>
