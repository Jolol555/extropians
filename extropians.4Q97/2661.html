Some good news on the civil liberties front.  You probably won't read<br>
about it in the newspapers or see it on CNN, however.<br>

Shirley Allen released<br>
======================<br>
<p>
By<br>
     JOE MAHR<br>
     JEFFERSON ROBBINS<br>
and  LESLEY ROGERS<br>
<p>
STAFF WRITERS<br>
<p>
<p>
ROBY - With an uneasy OK from prosecutors, Shirley Allen was returned <br>
to her home Tuesday with far less uproar than the day she was taken <br>
from it.<br>
<p>
Christian County State's Attorney Teresa Brown agreed to a request <br>
from Allen's attorneys to end the 51-year-old widow's 47-day stay in <br>
mental hospitals. That request followed a psychiatrist's finding that <br>
Allen wasn't dangerous - to herself or anyone else.<br>
<p>
"The state's not saying she's going to be OK," Brown said. "What we're <br>
saying is that, based on this doctor's report, it doesn't make a whole <br>
lot of sense to continue hospitalization for her."<br>
<p>
<p>
Regardless of prosecutors' reasoning, Allen's court-appointed guardian <br>
Lindsey Reese was content that Allen was back home instead of amassing <br>
more medical bills.<br>
<p>
"She was relieved of a heavy financial burden and will be home for the <br>
holidays," said Reese, who has estimated Allen's medical and legal <br>
bills at roughly $50,000.<br>
<p>
No one from Allen's family - the people who went to a judge asking for <br>
the psychiatric evaluation in September - was notified of her release.<br>
<p>
"I'm very upset about this," said Byron Dugger, Allen's brother who <br>
lives in Arkansas.<br>
<p>
"I didn't know it was going to happen. Nobody in my family knew it was <br>
going to happen. We're not happy about the way this was handled."<br>
<p>
<p>
Allen was released at noon Tuesday after a morning hearing and, after <br>
a brief stay at Reese's Taylorville office, arrived about 3 p.m. at <br>
the single-story home in rural Roby from where she fended off state <br>
police with a shotgun for 39 days.<br>
<p>
"She was really happy at the decision," Reese said. "She was really <br>
looking  forward to getting home and cleaning up her house."<br>
<p>
Reese pulled into the driveway while a second car ferried Allen to the <br>
rear of the house. She entered quickly while Reese gave a brief press <br>
conference.<br>
<p>
Allen could then be seen cleaning the house, one way to save the <br>
$2,900 estimated cost to eliminate the pepper-spray odor lingering <br>
from the standoff.<br>
<p>
Allen is expected to spend the next couple of days finishing reading a <br>
large box of letters from well-wishers. Reese said she plans to write <br>
thank-you's to most people and will use the many canned goods and <br>
bottles of water sent by supporters.<br>
<p>
<p>
Allen called her mother Tuesday night once she got home, said Dugger, <br>
who plans to meet with the judge and Allen's lawyers Thursday to find <br>
out why she was released.<br>
<p>
"They had a good conversation, my mother said. She sounded fine," <br>
Dugger said. ''She said she was happy to be home."<br>
<p>
Allen did not spend her first night of freedom at home but was <br>
planning to stay with friends to avoid the media, Dugger said.<br>
<p>
<p>
"No trespassing" signs were posted on the front lawn and in a window <br>
of the residence. Reese warned anyone who might approach that he would <br>
call police and prosecute trespassers.<br>
<p>
For a neighborhood that hosted up to 75 troopers during the standoff, <br>
it was unusually bare of any police during the homecoming. That's <br>
partly because sheriff's deputies didn't know for sure that Allen was <br>
coming home until told by a reporter.<br>
<p>
"We were totally in the dark," said investigator Bob Patrick, who <br>
oversaw the sheriff's office Tuesday in the absence of the sheriff and <br>
chief deputy.<br>
<p>
<p>
Allen's shotgun and ammunition remain confiscated, according to state <br>
police spokesman Mark McDonald. Troopers did leave behind two pistols, <br>
one an antique, he said. Neither has ammunition.<br>
<p>
<p>
The surprise release follows more than a month of legal maneuvers by <br>
Reese and defense attorney Bill Conroy of Athens. In the latest move <br>
last week, the pair got Allen's committal case moved to Christian <br>
County.<br>
<p>
The case was first set in Sangamon County because Allen was initially <br>
sent to St. John's Hospital in Springfield, but state law allows for a <br>
transfer to the defendant's home county.<br>
<p>
Sangamon County State's Attorney Patrick Kelley said Allen's lawyers <br>
had asked a judge to allow her go home while the case was in his <br>
jurisdiction, but the judge denied that motion. For one thing, no <br>
medical authority had come forward to say that Allen posed no threat.<br>
<p>
<p>
"It's a different set of facts (now) from what we had here," Kelley <br>
said.<br>
<p>
He said one factor in the case is still on appeal to the Fourth <br>
District Appellate Court, though that appeal may now be moot.<br>
<p>
In Tuesday's Christian County hearing, Allen was released based on a <br>
mental health examination by Dr. Bruce Feldman of Springfield, who <br>
said she's not a danger to herself or others, which is one legal <br>
guideline for being committed.<br>
<p>
Allen's release came on the condition that she submit to an evaluation <br>
by a court-appointed psychiatrist within 30 days. Feldman was hired by <br>
Allen's attorneys.<br>
<p>
And even if the court-appointed psychiatrist finds Allen perfectly <br>
fit, she could still face jail time.<br>
<p>
Although police have shunned the idea of criminal charges, Brown said <br>
she's still mulling over whether to charge Allen for her actions <br>
during the standoff. Those actions included Allen allegedly firing at <br>
troopers three times and shooting a police dog, who survived.<br>
<p>
Brown said a decision on criminal charges won't be made until after <br>
the committal process.<br>
<p>
"I'm still looking at the (police) reports right now," she said. "I <br>
can't really say it hinges on any one thing. It's just going to be a <br>
consideration of all the facts and<br>
circumstances."<br>
<p>
<p>
State police took Tuesday's news in stride.<br>
<p>
"After 47 days in a hospital under a doctor's care, it's not <br>
surprising that her condition has improved and she was released," <br>
McDonald said.<br>
<p>
"All anybody ever wanted was for Shirley to live a normal life. <br>
Hopefully, after all this time she's spent in the hospital, she's able <br>
to do that."<br>
<p>
But just what kind of care Allen has received remains a mystery. By <br>
state law, Allen can refuse treatment, something her family has said <br>
she's done throughout her hospital stay.<br>
<p>
Reese could not say what type of treatment she received during the <br>
course of her hospitalization or if she is currently taking any <br>
medication. She has taken anti-depressants in the past.<br>
<p>
Reese said after Allen gets settled back into her home, they may <br>
consider interviews with the media later this week.<br>
<p>
"She's overwhelmed right now," said Reese, who expects to end his job <br>
as Allen's legal guardian soon, possibly before her next 30-day <br>
evaluation. Reese's legal fees are paid through Allen's estate, and he <br>
said he cannot disclose how much he is paid.<br>
<p>
Once she was freed, Allen spent part of the day at the office Reese <br>
shares with his father and law partner, Daniel Reese. The elder Reese <br>
said he was amazed at the amount of media attention paid to Allen, <br>
whom he called "a very private person."<br>
<p>
<p>
"I told her, 'You're like Princess Diana,' " he said.<br>
<p>
<p>
"She said, 'But Princess Diana's dead.' "<br>
