In a message dated 97-10-04 11:04:24 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The funny thing is, by ASCII code, his name in numbers does not add up<br>
 to 666, contrary to Mac/Fundamentalists everywhere. It only adds up to<br>
 666 if you count his last last name (I don't know the proper term for<br>
 it) of III (as in The Third) as being either 111 as in one -one -one,<br>
 which it is not, it is roman numerals III and three I's in ascii don't<br>
 add up to 3, which would be the neccessary result to get 666 as a sum<br>
 for his whole name, or you'd have to call that name as "3", which would<br>
 be wrong, because if you used arabic numerals, it would be 3rd for<br>
 "third" so ascii is off again. This is one more example of idiots not<br>
 doing their homework.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Of course, but it still works doesnt it? Instead of translating the 3 into<br>
the number 3 represents, they just left it as 3.  Everything else is fine.<br>
 What do you think about the Pope's number? And what does TAANSTAFL mean?<br>
