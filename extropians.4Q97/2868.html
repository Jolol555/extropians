	I have paid much attention over the past couple years  to many<br>
debates on the issue of who should own guns and why.  At first, it seemed<br>
like a very important debate to me and I followed the arguments with<br>
interest.  But a simple realization gradually began asserting itself more<br>
and more insistently:  The only reason guns are a problem is because<br>
people kill each other with them.  But the real problem is not that<br>
people are using guns to kill each other but the fact  that they're<br>
killing each other at all.  The really important issue isn't guns; it's<br>
violence itself.  If we could get rid of violence, nearly all of our gun<br>
problems would disappear.  Now when I hear gun control debates, I am<br>
mostly disgusted that so many intelligent people are wasting so many<br>
hours and so much money debating gun  issues, which seem so trivial<br>
compared to the more encompassing and more important issues of violence<br>
itself.  What people ought to be doing is studying violence, working to<br>
understand why people behave violently and how we can prevent young<br>
humans from developing violent behaviors.<br>
<p>
	Solving the violence problem is a very extropian goal.  Humans<br>
are simply not as productive in a violent environment as they are in one<br>
where they don't have to worry so much about their personal safety. <br>
Also, the people engaging in violence could be using their time more<br>
productively than by harming or destroying intelligent systems.  We have<br>
no idea how many societies could have flourished and contributed<br>
immensely to the progress of Civilization but were held back by the<br>
violence of oppressive governments.   How many thousands of years was the<br>
industrial revolution held back because of the oppressive violence of<br>
monarchies and other violently suppressive social systems?   We have no<br>
idea how many geniuses were sent off to war to be killed or how many<br>
geniuses were abused so severely by their schoolmates and parents that<br>
they had no self-confidence to develop their abilities and help pull<br>
Humanity forward immeasurably.  Violence has cost us far more than we<br>
know.<br>
<p>
	I think this forum is an excellent one to discuss the violence<br>
problem.   Violent acts have a great potential to disrupt our visions of<br>
the future.  I don't think we can pursue our extropic ideas for long <br>
without doing much to solve the violence problem.  We need to consider<br>
why humans are violent.  From there, we can discuss ways of  effectively<br>
deterring violent behavior.  I think discussing the violence problem will<br>
be more interesting and more productive than  discussing the issue of who<br>
will be allowed to possess firearms.<br>
