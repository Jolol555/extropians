Most of all we should thank those who tried to do things that "cannot <br>
be done".  Most of them failed.  Many of them died.  But if they had <br>
not tried... <br>
<p>
I believe it was Heinlein who said something on the order of:<br>
<p>
"If an elderly and knowledgeable scientist tells you something can be <br>
done, he is very probably right.  If an elderly and knowledgeable <br>
scientist tells you something cannot be done, he is almost certainly <br>
wrong."<br>
<p>
To which I add:  <br>
<p>
Listen very carefully to WHY it cannot be done, because there's a <br>
good chance he'll accidentally tell you how to do it.<br>
