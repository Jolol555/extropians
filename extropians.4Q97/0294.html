Yes.  Although mass/energy is conserved, information is not.<br>
Values and knowledges are clearly more like information than<br>
they are like mass/energy.  Although now we're hunkered down<br>
next to Aristotle, staring the form vs. substance dichotomy in<br>
the face again.  <br>
<p>
I have to recommend Paul M. Churchland's essay on moral realism,<br>
which is the last chapter of his book A NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL<br>
PERSPECTIVE.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a game-theoretic point of view, one tentative morality that</i><br>
I rather like is the imperative to seek out and engage in<br>
positive-sum games, while avoiding zero-sum and negative-sum<br>
games.  But even here there are metaphysical problems: is a<br>
positive-sum game possible?  (I think so.)  What is it that<br>
increases in the operation of a positive-sum game?<br>
<p>
That imperative recast in biological terms is "Prefer symbiosis<br>
to parasitism."  I suspect that the biological phenomena of<br>
symbiosis and parasitism might be most clearly defined in terms<br>
of game theory, but I haven't run across anyone who has done<br>
this yet.  (I haven't been looking very hard yet either.)<br>
<p>
Symbiosis is an instance of an ongoing positive-sum<br>
game among a group of organisms or populations.<br>
