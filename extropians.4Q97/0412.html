Many of you may have heard something on the news regarding the mass <br>
killings a few days ago at a high school in Pearl, Mississippi.  <br>
Extended print accounts regarding it have revealed a few details of <br>
particular interest to anyone who wonders into what possible directions <br>
the memes we propogate can go.<br>
<p>
After first noting that nothing justifies the actions that these <br>
youngsters took against their own kind, I would call your attention <br>
to a few very telling points regarding the thought processes and <br>
motivation behind these horrendous acts.  I'll lay out the clues and <br>
a few thoughts on them (these quotes are from the Washington Post):<br>
<p>
'Shortly after the killings, police began picking up rumors that <br>
Woodham and his friends, whom classmates and teachers describe as <br>
brainy loners who called themselves 'The Group', were involved in <br>
everything from animal sacrifices to embracing in bizarre form the <br>
anti-Christian views of the 19th century philosophy German <br>
philosopher Frederich Nietzche'.<br>
<p>
One of Woodham's friends, Justin Sledge, interrupted a prayer vigil <br>
to state that Woodham 'went mad because of society.  We, as a <br>
society, must change.'  He later clarified:  'society as a whole puts <br>
down the thinkers and true geniuses of the world and replaces them <br>
with men whose strength is physical strength and physical abilities.'<br>
<p>
<p>
What does all of this mean?  It's too early to say for sure, and I am <br>
sure that the trial will reveal more, but I already discern a general <br>
societal conflict regarding hyperintelligent youngsters feeling <br>
trapped and isolated in an undeveloped small town that happens to be <br>
located in the one state of the Union consistently at the bottom of <br>
the rankings of scholastic achievement.  They banded together and <br>
looked for support in some of the same memetic coordinates as we do, <br>
but without mature guidance they quickly developed those memes in a <br>
pathological direction that led to horrible consequences.  <br>
<p>
The town seems to have chosen to deal with this situation in terms of <br>
'anti-Christian' behavior--I wonder if anyone there will take a few <br>
minutes to consider how these boys were treated by their peers.  This <br>
is not the first case in which a brainy child went postal on his <br>
classmates, one other made the news a few years ago.  I think <br>
that these children are the forerunners of our future, and their <br>
parents and schools do not know what to do with them.  And so some of <br>
them fall, in various ways, some more public than others.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
<p>
