The Transhuman well<br>
<p>
This text is trying to represent the History and<br>
Future vision of the<br>
Tranhumanists and Extropists. If you are new to the<br>
movement you can <br>
use this text as a starting point for your journey<br>
into this really <br>
exciting and wonderful universe of the ideas,<br>
predictions and scientific<br>
basis that the Transhuman philosophy is build on. The<br>
text is build over <br>
a period of time with help of all the people<br>
mentioned below. It's a <br>
Dynamic text, that is wide open for discussion. But<br>
to keep it as a <br>
reference point. It will be fixed for at least one<br>
year. After that it <br>
will include as much as criticism, new idea's and new<br>
insights as possible. <br>
All lines will have a number in front. This will make<br>
it easy for anybody, <br>
who would like to share an other or additional<br>
opinion, to refer to the <br>
specific part of the text.<br>
<p>
The numbers themselves will lead you to additional<br>
information <br>
or other visions.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Big Bang<br>
15.000.000.000 years ago nothing became<br>
something...............<br>
Quantum mechanics<br>
Cooling process<br>
Forming the Universe<br>
Time and Space<br>
Chaos and order<br>
<p>
AT&gt; Firstly living in a infinite universe or finite<br>
universe sets the precedence on what we can actually<br>
do with the rest of humankind...and our extropian<br>
endeavours<br>
We should try to resolve whether the universe is<br>
either one or the other first,....but it's<br>
interesting to see that there was a beginning /<br>
broken symmetry in spacetime....<br>
<p>
Earth<br>
This lucky blue ball had something special<br>
................................<br>
First life forms and how they came about<br>
Evolution, Chaos, Bacteria<br>
Competition<br>
DNA<br>
The Apes<br>
Civilization, Chinese ? Egypt and pyramids<br>
The 'Information entity' us !<br>
Social aspects<br>
Political aspects<br>
<p>
AT&gt; I always have this thing that this lucky blue<br>
ball didn't just come about,....and I'd like to<br>
explore the anthropic principle ,... we're not just<br>
lucky !!!<br>
I believe in the fact of evolution but not extending it<br>
to say that every living creature is a product of<br>
evolution ( Darwinian? ) because of the lack of<br>
'transitional' forms....<br>
<p>
Civilization<br>
Using tools<br>
Religion<br>
Science an Alchemy<br>
Industrial period<br>
Computers<br>
The "information entity" us !<br>
Social aspects<br>
Political aspects<br>
<p>
AT&gt; Social/political aspects , I feel these are<br>
bottomless wells , you know it's like let's work with<br>
what we do know....and not on how we feel......<br>
hard sciences....<br>
<p>
NOW<br>
Were are we heading for<br>
Extropians, history  !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Transhuman, history !!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Cryonics, today<br>
Nanotechnology, today<br>
Computer/IT, today<br>
Space travel/living,today<br>
The "information entity" us !<br>
Social aspects<br>
Political aspects<br>
<p>
AT&gt; Great!!!, Let's tread cautiously though, let's<br>
deal with what we do know,...in doubt stay out...<br>
information entity has that a way of transcending<br>
what we don't know about....<br>
<p>
The near Future (less...then 100 years)<br>
Singularity<br>
Computers, then<br>
Nanotechnology, then<br>
Space travel/living, then<br>
The "information entity" us<br>
Social aspects <br>
Political aspects<br>
Cryonics<br>
We as movement<br>
<p>
The far Future (more then 100 years)<br>
Well.....................<br>
<p>
AT&gt; Computers and Nanotech and Space<br>
That's what we need to urgently develope,....<br>
the culture will evolve from the technology.......<br>
cryos, space travel right?<br>
<p>
That's my rap for now,<br>
pls feedback<br>
