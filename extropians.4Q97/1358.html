<i>&gt; &gt; number of stars).  If there is an infinite space per star, it seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible that it won't get filled.  One infinite amount does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; necessarily equal another.  For instance, how big is an infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; amount of space squared?  Is it bigger than a "regular" infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; amount?  Greg</i><br>

<i>&gt; Ok, wait a moment while I don my impressive mathematicians robe</i><br>
<i>&gt; (complete with chalk dust)... :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Infinities are tricky, but if you know the rules and are a bit careful</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can handle them with no danger. Yes, there are differently "sized"</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinities, some much "larger" than others. But in this case it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; much simpler.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the star example, let's say there are around 1 star per cubic</i><br>
<i>&gt; lightyear. That means that on a sphere of radius r there will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; around 4 Pi r^2 stars. The intensity of a star at distance r is L/r^2</i><br>
<i>&gt; where L is a constant (I assume all stars are equally bright now, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplicitys sake). This means that the 4 pi r^2 stars on the sphere</i><br>
<i>&gt; around us will shine with a total power of 4 Pi L - the two r^2 terms</i><br>
<i>&gt; cancel each other. So the total luminosity from a spherical shell</i><br>
<i>&gt; around us is independent of it's radius. This means that if we get one</i><br>
<i>&gt; unit of light from all stars 1 lightyear away, we will get one unit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the stars 2 lightyears away, one from all stars 3 lightyears</i><br>
<i>&gt; away, and so on. As you sum up the contributions from all the shells</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sum get's larger and larger. And if you assume an infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe you will have to sum up the contributions of ever more remote</i><br>
<i>&gt; stars, and the total luminosity will become larger than any finite</i><br>
<i>&gt; luminosity.</i><br>
<p>
However, unlike pure numbers, in terms of "real" photons, you can't have<br>
a fraction of one from a source. You either have none or one or more<br>
integers of photons. Fractional photons only exist in a virtual state,<br>
as in the ZPF. Given this, you need to treat the light from each star<br>
relative to distance like its on a halflife type scale. THis should<br>
limit the total luminosity of a infinite universe, shouldn't it?<br>
Additionally, consider the filtering effects of non-luminous matter. For<br>
example, the actual core of our galaxy is, from our point of view, one<br>
of the dimmest parts of the milky way, because that region also has the<br>
most dust clouds, but it also has the highest density of stars, but it<br>
isn't bright, is it? The existence of dark matter can also be used in a<br>
steady infinite universe to explain the dark sky.<br>
