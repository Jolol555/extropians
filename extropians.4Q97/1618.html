Extropy Institute (ExI) has for years used such names as "ExI", "Extropy,"<br>
"Extropians," "Extro," and "Exponent."  We have invested a lot of hard work<br>
and hard cash into developing labels that the public will recognize and<br>
associate with high quality transhumanist thinking and networking.  Our good<br>
names represent just about the only assets that we have and serve as<br>
absolutely vital tools for our mission.<br>
<p>
Naturally, we want to prevent people from confusing other transhumanist<br>
projects with our own, just as other people do not want ExI to mistakenly get<br>
credit for their work.  Clear labels benefit all of us.  I don't think that<br>
anyone would dispute that ExI would have every right to object to another<br>
transhumanist group using "Extropy" or closely related names such as<br>
"Ekstropy" or "Expro."<br>
<p>
My (until now, private) discussions with Berrie, Arjen, and others of the<br>
Dutch group have focused on whether or not "Excedo" is likely to confuse<br>
newbies about the affiliation of that group with ExI, and how to avoid such<br>
confusion.  I have worked hard with Berrie to come up with alternative<br>
labels; there is, after all, no shortage of good words out there that do<br>
*not* risk creating confusion!  And any new group that claims to offer<br>
innovative thinking should, I think, want a very distinctive and original<br>
name.<br>
<p>
Berrie and I have had cordial, but thus far inconclusive, discussions.  He<br>
and his friends evince good intentions, so I remain optimistic that we can<br>
work out a suitable compromise.  Those of you new to this issue should keep<br>
in mind that you may lack essential details; this is a complicated issue (and<br>
should have remained, at least for now, a private one).  I do not have the<br>
time or inclination to educate everyone about what constitutes the law,<br>
custom, and just plain old common courtesy in matters of labelling, but I do<br>
hope that this email has clarified things a bit.<br>
<p>
Perhaps some of you could help Berrie and his colleagues come up with<br>
alternative names!  I've had fun cooking up words like "Acceleratism,"<br>
"Altalibre," and "Ultravita," but, alas, have yet to offer him a winning<br>
label.<br>
