<i>&gt; ...Generally people react quite negatively to having </i><br>
<i>&gt; something taken away (much more so than to an a equivalent gain)...</i><br>
<p>
...And even when what is "taken away" wasn't theirs to begin with.<br>
<p>
It never ceases to amaze me how many people complain that something is<br>
being "taken away" when it was a freebie to begin with.  No one has any<br>
inherent right to post to a list maintained by someone else, and<br>
restricting the list will not alter one bit the right of non-members<br>
to form their own list--hell, I'll host it myself if they really want<br>
one.  The question is not what the list posters want; the question is<br>
how ExI can best spend /its/ money.  If a closed list is of the greatest<br>
benefit to ExI--not the posters, just ExI--then that's what they should<br>
choose to pay for, nothing more.<br>
<p>
As a current freeloader on this list, I have not the slightest illusion<br>
that I'm entitled to anything from ExI I haven't paid for.  If they<br>
want to continue allowing me to freeload, that's their business, but if<br>
they want to spend their money more frugally, the freeloaders will just<br>
have to form their own list or pay up.  TANSTAAFL!<br>
