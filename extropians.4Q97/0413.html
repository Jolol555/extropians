<p>
Well, "touch up" is used to refer to detail work, editing, etc., of<br>
projects.  "Let me touch up your paint job."  "We touched up the<br>
document."  I don't think it comes from blending the idioms you mention,<br>
although I'd say it's certainly analogous in structure to "catch up."<br>
The meanings of verbs in English and other languages are often modified or<br>
unpredictably changed by particles or prefixes.  For example: compare the<br>
sentences "I ran out of the house" and "I ran out of cheese."  The first<br>
has a simple verb, ran, followed by a prepositional phrase.  The second<br>
has a verb with a particle (structurallly one word).<br>
<p>
Here are the phrase structure trees for the two sentences.<br>
<p>
I ran out of the house             I ran out of cheese<br>

              /    /  N*                         of     cheese<br>
             /    /     \<br>
            /    DET     N<br>
           of    the   house<br>
<p>
[where NP and N* are noun phrases, VP is a verb phrase, and PP is a<br>
prepositional phrase; Det is determiner (article, quantifier, etc). "of"<br>
Case-marks cheese; it is inserted via a transformation and is not found<br>
in the deep structure of the sentence.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do other writing systems (Cyrillic, Kanji, etc.) design out this sort</i><br>
<i>&gt; of problem?  Do other languages in our writing system have it (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; often)?  It seems to me that English would be particularly prone</i><br>
<i>&gt; since we have so many words and so many idiomatic phrases.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think an algorithm for creating new words to convey new meanings<br>
is really a problem.  All languages have some algorithm for recombining<br>
old elements to cover new concepts; creativity in production of discrete<br>
units is one of the fundamental properties of language.  It doesn't really<br>
have much to do with what script you use to write your language out.<br>
<p>
English has a large vocabulary due to the number and diversity of its<br>
speakers; as for idiomatic phrases, which every language has, I doubt<br>
English has more than any other language shared by a vast speech<br>
community.<br>
