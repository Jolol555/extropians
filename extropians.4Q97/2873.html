Hag, old bean:<br>
<p>
I feel the need to tear into this a bit more thoroughly, like one of those<br>
magic-store vdieos that take a whole half-hour to show you one trick.<br>
Please don't interpret this as me tearing into you, OK?<br>
<p>
When we last saw our intrepid explorers, we heard Hag's rejoinder as<br>
follows...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;your own personal autonomy and freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This, while it is arguable, is a complete non-sequitur. The "if this is so,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; then" part of your sentence suggests a sequitur for which I find no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; evidence in any of the rest of your post. Are you, perhaps, throwing sand</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the bull's eyes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huh? If the aggregate external costs are greater than the aggregate</i><br>
<i>&gt;external benefits, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is</i><br>
<i>&gt;telling us because those costs are not included in the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt;production. If guns aren't as inexpensive as the market is telling us,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then before we decide if they are practical we best figure out how much</i><br>
<i>&gt;they *do* cost us. I'm using "practical" in one of its common sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;meanings: "efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose."</i><br>
<p>
_That's_ not where I have a problem. Your quote only shows the second thing<br>
I quoted. <br>
<p>
Please consider again what you wrote, with the two pieces glued back together.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this is so, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is telling us,     &lt;- That's</i><br>
the first part &gt;<br>
<i>&gt;and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring        &lt;- That's</i><br>
the second part &gt;<br>
<i>&gt;your own personal autonomy and freedom.</i><br>
<p>
OK, let's play word pseudocode / algebra for a minute.<br>
<p>
Assumed: Value = Cost + Benefit      <br>
    (...Cost treated as a negative; non-positive value if magnitude of<br>
benefit not greater than magnitude of cost)<br>
Then Value - Cost = Benefit.<br>
<p>
What you said, I read as<br>
   If PropositionP = True, then <br>
<p>
      ( | TrueCostOfF |  &gt; | MarketCostOfF | )<br>
<p>
      AND<br>
<p>
      ( ValueOfF  .MayNotBeEqTo.  Optimum ).<br>
<p>
You see the ringer there now?  Somehow I think a card got stuck to your<br>
hand there, pard'... :)<br>
<p>
You never dealt with any reading of Benefit, either True OR Market. And<br>
*then* some OPTIMUM came blackwinging in from hypertheticalspace (your<br>
phrase was "most practical") ...as if such a thing could be determined or<br>
was the measure that was being discussed. AND you never said anything about<br>
the fact that without any other data, if all you've determined is that the<br>
magnitude of your expenses is greater than the total of the checks you<br>
registered in your checkbook, you can't tell if you're broke.<br>
<p>
You might as well have said "Since orange juice might be more fairly priced<br>
higher than $1.75 a quart, which is what they charge me down at the store,<br>
orange juice may not be the perfect food."<br>
<p>
Huh? yourself. : Until you mentioned it, I don't recall anyone talking<br>
about the "most practical" (the "perfect food").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I don't want this to devolve into a kneejerking match, but let me pose the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; same question I asked earlier in a slightly different form: what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; external cost of that left-for-dead fifteen year old girl?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is beyond my ability to assign a monetary value to a human life. </i><br>
<p>
Seems to me someone with that limitation would have a hard time evaluating<br>
TrueMarketBenefit and TrueMarketCost, no?<br>
<p>
:)<br>
<p>
I'm left with only one possible explanation for this misunderstanding: Is<br>
it your impression that one side of (or even _any_ of) the participants in<br>
this specific discussion think that "orange juice is the perfect food" (to<br>
use my analogy)? Did they SAY that anywhere, or is someone doing a little<br>
amateur mindreading here?<br>
 <br>
_I_ certainly never said that. Who did? Raise your hands, please... <br>
<p>
:)<br>
