<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I find it very frustrating that the list spends so much time on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; irrelevant issues of economics and politics. The current economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and political environment will not change significantly prior to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the singularity: there's not enough time, even if the event occurs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in 2025.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have to disagree with you at least on the economics part. Before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we get to a singularity caused by nanotech or powerful enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computers for human-level AI there will be major economic changes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; due to the increasing cheapness of computing power and bandwidth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; These changes result in what Wired calls a "Network Economy" (see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Wired 5.09, "New Rules for the New Economy"); we already live in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the beginnings of this, everything on the net is part of it. Article</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is here: <a href="http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html">http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It makes some interesting points, especially the idea that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if not all commodities in our world are dipping towards being free.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anything from a CD player to a modem to a stock quote online gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cheaper. In the coming years your phone line will dip towards free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as they offer you better stuff(xDSL) for $$$. Reading and becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; familiar with these ideas can give you a powerful edge- for me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reading it triggered an idea for a new net-based business that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is starting up on Monday!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As for politics, I can tell you from my experience that since I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ran into the net 4 years ago it has significantly changed _me_.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think that over the next 25 years or so as the majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the planet gains net access (hopefully) there is the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for something to happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, many things will get a lot cheaper. Moore's law is an exponential,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and has survived all attempts at constraint due to physical laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; by hoppong from one technology to another. Yes, the underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept of economic value will change radically for a large percentage</i><br>
<i>&gt; of current GNP. Yes, this is all revolutionary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, our political world is changing in some ways due to bette</i><br>
<i>&gt; information flow, and may change some more.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There will be dramatic pre-singularity econimic changes, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibly technology-driven political changes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point is that we should be discussing these changes, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; political and economic philosophy based on the current situation.</i><br>
<p>
Full agreement here...<br>
<p>
So how long do you think it will take for your car to become an<br>
extension of your home entertainment system? It is one of my<br>
current dreams (if I had the money) to form a company to network<br>
my car to a CD jukebox at home so I can listen to any of my<br>
CDs without having to cart them all around. Ditto for programming<br>
your VCR from afar... The only real limitation I see is the cost<br>
of wireless connections. But with companies here in Atlanta offering<br>
unlimited airtime until Jan 1. and companies in SF like Metricom<br>
offering unlimited 28.8 speed access for $40/month it seems<br>
possible. All of this of course is an extension of the idea in<br>
Negroponte's Being Digital book about moving bits not atoms...<br>
