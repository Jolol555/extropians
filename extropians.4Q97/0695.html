<i>&gt; &gt;This is not to say that all such relationships are bogus. I have a gut</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;feeling that Bode's law may have an underlying cause based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mechanics of the original solar accretion disk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you mean the disk that formed the planets?  What is Bode's law?  I feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same way,  I also believe there's a lot going on in saturn's rings, given</i><br>
<i>&gt; the braided rings, and god knows what else.  Oh, there's also high voltage</i><br>
<i>&gt; bursts emanating from saturn that is synchronistic with a specific place on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ring.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the disk that formed the Sun and its planetary system. Bode's "law"<br>
is<br>
simply an observation of a relationship between the ratios of sizes of<br>
the<br>
orbits of the six classical planets and a certain nesting of platonic<br>
solids. This observed nesting "predicts" an orbit for a planet between<br>
Mars and Jupiter. Bode's law predates the telescope. The asteroids were<br>
discovered after Bode's law, and the Bode's law orbit is consistent with<br>
the mean orbit of the asteroids. Please note: This can very well all<br>
still<br>
be coincidence. However, There may be a physical explanation. Since<br>
planetary orbits affect each other the phenomenon of orbital resonance<br>
may have caused clumping of planetisimals as the solar accretion disk<br>
coalesced.  This clumping would not be random, but would likely cause<br>
earlier-coalescing outer planets to pre-determine the orbits of<br>
later-coalescing inner planets in a progression from outer to inner.<br>
This would determine both the orbits and the sizes. I thought this up<br>
all by my big self, but I suspect that professional astronomers have<br>
independently dreamed this up many times in the past. We now have some<br>
new mathematical tools to use on the problem. I have neither the time<br>
nor<br>
the skill to pursue this, but it's fun to speculate. Please note: this<br>
depends only on the known laws of physics, no devine intervention is<br>
needed.<br>
