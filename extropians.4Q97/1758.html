<i>&gt; What do you mean? Daedalus escaped quite handily, it was Icarus who</i><br>

<i>&gt; to begin with (exile or something).</i><br>
<p>
No, that is not entirely true. Daedalus did (according to the story)<br>
kill his nephew, and was forced to flee from his home city to Rhodos<br>
where Minos greeted him and allowed him a place at the court where he<br>
began to build the Labyrinth. But the king's wife had got a thing<br>
about the holy bull in the temple, and asked Daedalus to help her get<br>
its attention. So he fashioned a hollow cow-model for her, and she<br>
went to the temple. Nine months later Minos got very upset by her<br>
child (as a rule, *never* have intercourse with something from the<br>
greek pantheon without contraceptives! :-), and imprisoned it, the<br>
Minotaur, and Daedalus (plus Icaros, I suppose) in the Labyrinth.<br>
<p>
The moral seems to be: think a bit about the consequences before you<br>
invent something (and do explain the operational parameters to the<br>
users!).<br>
<p>
I really like the Daedalus character, with all his flaws. I have been<br>
thinking writing up a small dialogue/micro drama with Daedalus,<br>
Icaros, the Minotaur and Minos as characters. Daedalus is dynamic<br>
optimism ("Let's find a way to get out of here!"), Icaros is passive<br>
optimism ("Everything will be all right if dad says so"), the Minotaur<br>
is the passive pessimist ("I'm an ugly monster and I deserve to be<br>
locked in") and Minos the active pessimist ("The whole bunch is<br>
dangerous to mankind, let's lock them in").<br>
