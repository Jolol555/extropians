Most (if not 99.9%) of anti-Microsoft hype is due purely to the herd<br>
mentality.  It all started YEARS ago when MS was still located in New<br>
Mexico.  Bill et al wrote a BASIC compiler for the early micros.  The MS<br>
boys used to drive around in a van and demonstrate it to try and sell<br>
it.  This was when most systems used tape for uploading and storage.<br>
They visited the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley and in their<br>
excitement a tape was stolen (supposedly one that would run on the<br>
pre-apples being developed by Woz and Jobs).  The tape was duplicated<br>
and given away free to all who wanted it.  Bill found out and wrote a<br>
letter to the early Dr. Dobb's journal (it wasn't called that<br>
then...forgot exactly the name) about how whoever took the tape was a<br>
thief and blah blah.  This did not sit well with the early enthusiasts<br>
who basically saw all software as public domain.<br>
<p>
All the wannabe's of the world just got onboard the anti-Bill campaign<br>
to 'belong'.<br>
<p>
The rest is history.<br>

	I hear from people who want to do business with mocrosoft,<br>
develop apps<br>
	for windows, etc. but are too cheap to get the full microsoft<br>
training<br>
	in developing apps for windows (so what if they charge a lot,<br>
its their<br>
	proprietary info, and they can charge whatever they want). Yet<br>
they have<br>
	the gall to complain that there are "undocumented" features that<br>
they<br>
	didn't know about. DUH. SOunds like a candidate for welfare...<br>
<i>	&gt; </i><br>
<i>	&gt; But maybe these people are all incredebly naive and don't</i><br>
understand IT at<br>
<i>	&gt; all ;-). Sort of like us poor IBM-ers. Why is it that every</i><br>
time M$ outfits<br>
<i>	&gt; a company with NT they come to IBM (or another IT consultant</i><br>
company) for<br>
<i>	&gt; help with their suddenly HUGE security and systems-management</i><br>
problems? Why<br>
<i>	&gt; is it that it takes three times as long to get Systems</i><br>
Management software<br>
<i>	&gt; working in an NT Client-Server</i><br>
(if_you_insist_on_calling_it_that)<br>
<i>	&gt; environment?.</i><br>
<p>
	maybe because IBM's systems management software was optimized<br>
for OS/2,<br>
	that hugely successful operating system that spelled IBM's<br>
demise.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; </i><br>
<i>	&gt; Isn't the fact that there are lot's of anti-MS sites around</i><br>
saying something?<br>
<i>	&gt; I've never come accross an anti-IBM site (Or HP, Apple, SGI,</i><br>
SUN, Corel....).<br>
<i>	&gt; But if anyone can locate one I'll be most interested in it's</i><br>
content.<br>
<p>
	Its really not polite to kick someone when they are down....<br>
