<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Extropian in that he has stood up and accepted personal responsibility<br>
to:<br>
<p>
1) Exercise his 2nd amendment rights<br>
2) Defend himself, his loved ones, and his and their property.<br>
3) Expand his personal experiences, etc.<br>
<p>
As a caveat I would say: a) I hope Anton has taken, or plans to take in<br>
the near future, gun and hunter safety courses, possibly even self<br>
defense courses, and b) I wish he had bought an American made firearm. I<br>
could have helped him acquire, for the same price or less, a new, fully<br>
tested and posessing a lifetime warranty, Ruger rifle. When I mean<br>
lifetime, I mean LIFETIME. I've seen people send in the most abused,<br>
messed up guns to be fully repaired or replaced at no charge. Anton<br>
couldn't hope to get that from his Vietnamese arms merchant.<br>
<p>
The only thing I would criticize Anton about is that.<br>
