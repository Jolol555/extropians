<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding my claims that a well-trained (in personal combat /</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-defense skills) population is a good way to deter violence, Dwayne</i><br>
<i>&gt; commented that if -everyone- is well-trained, the training is of less</i><br>
<i>&gt; value.  I don't see why.  </i><br>
<p>
Less difference in skill levels between highly trained and untrained<br>
individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There would, of course, be wide variations in</i><br>
<i>&gt; different people's skill levels, but it would be difficult to detect how</i><br>
<i>&gt; well-trained someone was just by watching them in ordinary activities. </i><br>
<p>
This is not true. I have had extensive martial arts training in the past,<br>
and I can spot people who have a fair amount of training a mile away. I've<br>
not kept this up recently, but when I was going to classes most nights of<br>
the week, and therefore constantly around people trained, in training <br>
and training others, I found that after a while I could spot people if <br>
I was out, and would quite often walk up to them and discuss whatever <br>
style they practiced with them, introducing myself at the time.<br>
<p>
There's a weird physical meme people acquire, almost like an "accent" and<br>
if you have this "accent" yourself, or are familiar with it, you can<br>
readily detect it. At one stage I had a few friends who all shared a house<br>
who were Federal Police (erm, I'm in Australia, I think they are similar to<br>
the US FBI or Scotland Yard in the UK). One night I was at a pub, and there<br>
was a guy standing in the bar who reminded me of my friends. I pointed this<br>
out to a friend of mine sitting beside me, who said he had noticed the same<br>
thing. So my friend walked up and asked him if he was a Fed. The guy was<br>
surprised to be asked this, but showed his badge to my friend (who refused<br>
to believe the guy and so asked him to produce ID).  The only way I can<br>
explain this is that the Feds work together, and have acquired an "accent"<br>
to their stance or gait or some other physical habit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Right now, most people aren't well-trained, so a street thug who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; alright at fighting knows that he (or she) has a very good chance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; assaulting someone and getting away with it.  </i><br>
<p>
In fact thugs will generally not take on people who might be able to fight<br>
back, and unless they are telepathic or engage their victim in discussion<br>
before the assault, I don't see how they could do this, unless it is<br>
possible to detect the lack of a certain element in the victim's physical<br>
movement.<br>
<p>
An aside: I read a very long time ago in a magazine that a movie studio was<br>
hiring people to be trained as steadicam operators, and found that nearly<br>
all of the people hired had martial arts experience, as martial arts tends<br>
to produce a flat gait (the person doesn't rise up on their toes when<br>
taking a step, and so the head doesn't bob up and down as much). I have no<br>
idea where I read this, it just stuck in my memory at the time, as I had<br>
started training about 9 months before, and went out to see if i walked<br>
with a flat gait.  I did. But hadn't really noticed how I waked before my<br>
training started  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But if everyone or most</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone was at least fairly well-trained, assaulting someone would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; very risky.  The small woman you thought you could easily rape could have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been training ninjutsu since she was a child.  Or the old man you thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could hold up and knife-point for his wallet could have been training</i><br>
<i>&gt; all his life.  You just never know.  It becomes too risky to just try</i><br>
<i>&gt; assaulting people to find out if they're less well-trained than you are. </i><br>
<p>
But if the thug was as well trained as an average person to start with,<br>
then I would assume they'd get better at hitting people with practice, and<br>
so would be as good as the highly trained grandmother you mention.<br>
<p>
Or at least notice that the grandmother was highly trained (I would think<br>
that this would be a fairly easy thing to do given that this sort of<br>
training produces a reasonably nimble elder practitioner, and very few<br>
elderly people could be described as nimble.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The other factor is the other well-trained people around them.  People</i><br>
<i>&gt; who are well-trained in self-defense aren't going to walk alone in</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous places.  When bystanders are capable of mangling and killing</i><br>
<i>&gt; you in a matter of seconds, violence simply becomes too risky to engage</i><br>
<i>&gt; in.  </i><br>
<p>
I walk all over the place in Melbourne where I live. I'm not a very<br>
physically strong person, and can only assume that I would be quite<br>
vulnerable ordinarily.<br>
<p>
But as it stands, it is very very rare indeed for me to feel bothered by a<br>
location I am walking through, and I can count the number of times I have<br>
been hassled in the last 10 years on two fingers. Mind you, guns are very<br>
very very rare over here, the number of people killed by gunshot in the<br>
city of app. 4 million people I live in, on an annual basis, would be maybe<br>
20-30. I can find out if people -really- need to know, but it's a pretty<br>
rare thing for someone to be shot dead. Whatever is on television at the <br>
time is usually interrupted, or a "special news bulletin" follows the<br>
program. So it comes down to physical strength, speed and training, I<br>
suppose. And on that level I generally feel pretty well-armed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When the populace are the police, criminals cannot survive.</i><br>
<p>
I would agree with this, although you would, I suppose, need to introduce<br>
fairly rigorous police training for everyone who *does* want to take the<br>
law into their own hands.<br>
<p>
Which is not such a silly idea, you know. If everyone was trained in the<br>
law, unarmed and armed combat, ethics, etc, given the same training as the<br>
police force in other words, as a requirement before they were allowed to<br>
go off and arrest people, and were responsible for their actions when<br>
making the arrest, society may well wind up a bit quieter.<br>
<p>
Mind you, we have "citizen's arrest" over here, which allows anyone to<br>
arrest anyone else if the arrestee has committed or is committing a crime.<br>
<p>
But hardly anyone is as well trained in it as the police, so we tend to<br>
just ring them up and let them come and take care of it. Mobile phones are<br>
useful in this regard, and I suppose eventually very very small video<br>
cameras will be built into phones, which would be a great way to record<br>
evidence.<br>
