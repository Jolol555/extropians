Hey Dan,<br>
<p>
Please do me a favor and send an e-mail to my homeschooled children<br>
explaining that they can't have the telescope we are saving up for because<br>
we just have to keep the "system" alive for a couple more decades.  I have<br>
not been able to figure out just the right words to make them understand<br>
that they are "human resources", and that it is a "moral" imperative that<br>
they blindly follow whatever "system" that is in power, especially when<br>
that "system" will be the one to lead them to utopia.<br>
<p>
*  quotations were for emphasis, not to imply that you actually used those<br>
words<br>

Sarcastically yours,  Dana K.<br>
