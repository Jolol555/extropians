<i>&gt; I have read Prometheus rising several times as well as many of RAW's other</i><br>

I agree, and this is one of my more specific points. The brain is powerful<br>
hardware, but limited by its software -- its operating system, to stretch the<br>
metaphor. Of course, the primary difficulty is transcending the operating<br>
system to modify it, or even replace it entirely. I must admit that I'm a bit<br>
skeptical about circuits six through eight, but of course this is a result of<br>
the operating system I'm currently using (Microsoft's Rational-Critical Law<br>
Student &lt;grin&gt;).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My re-programming began with</i><br>
<i>&gt; a right temporal lobectomy. In the two months after surgery I was concerned</i><br>
<i>&gt; only with the basics of survival (Circuit One for those familiar with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Leary-Wilson 8 Circuit model) during which I found it possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; re-imprint fundamental programs about how I perceive the world, myself and</i><br>
<i>&gt; how to move from one perceptual framwork to another - that the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; framework I am using is but one of billions and if I find it not to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure, it is possible to change to a perspective that is more to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; liking.</i><br>
<p>
Can you give some specifics? I don't see any radical surgery in my future, but<br>
I'm sure you've acquired some knowledge I would find helpful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  As I gained more functions I found myself blissfully hanging out</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the 5th circuit. From the Hedonic Engineering capability of the 5th</i><br>
<i>&gt; circuit I discovered it easy to jump to the 6th and 7th so as to literally</i><br>
<i>&gt; change my world. In other words, as many before me have doneI used somatic</i><br>
<i>&gt; bliss as a conduit to expanded consciousness. The benefits are many. For me</i><br>
<i>&gt; I find joy and expansiveness comes from the ability to program the</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Again, something to sink my teeth into?<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
