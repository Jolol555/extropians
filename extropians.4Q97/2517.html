<i>&gt; &gt;the 7:2 margin among American respondants does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;heavily weight toward the original statement, that more subscribers on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;average own guns than the general population</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do USA-only statistics give heavier weight to statements concerning</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian-subscribers ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; As the extropian list is obviously made up of both USA and international</i><br>
<i>&gt; subscribers, surely the heaviest weight should be given to figures that include</i><br>
<i>&gt; both USA and international data.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought you were linking the extropian *mindset* to *gun-ownership*.</i><br>
<p>
The original debated statement was that there were more gun owners to<br>
non gun owners on the list than was in the general population. The only<br>
statistic I have that is reliable, to my knowledge, of gun ownership in<br>
a general population, is the 60 million owners figure that I've gotten<br>
from both NRA and HCI propaganda, as well as others. There are also<br>
approximately 200 million guns in  private hands in the US as well. I<br>
don't have figures for the world at large, or for any other specific<br>
country. If anyone has such data and can provide it, I would appreciate<br>
it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the question is the link between extropian *mind-set* and gun ownership in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the *USA* then you may aswell use the international figures as you can remove me</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the "anti" and put me into the "pro-gun" column.  I don't believe in gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership for myself in my country, but would certainly own one if I was in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; USA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You might find that the other two non-USA anti-gun owners would also change</i><br>
<i>&gt; their vote if you asked them how they'd feel living without a gun in the states.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Its a different question altogether than the one that was originally asked.</i><br>
<p>
I really only did it for the statistical comparison, though if I wanted<br>
to be snide, I suppose I'd ask if one lived in a country like, say,<br>
China, that one would be just hunky dory happy as a clam that one had no<br>
right to free speech, no right to travel as you please, no right to<br>
domocratic pluralism, etc, just because one happened to live is such a<br>
place.<br>
<p>
I personally beleive that all people should have the sort of rights we<br>
have here, and as Mao Tse Dungbeetle said, "Justice comes from the<br>
barrel of a gun". The right to keep and bear arms is the spring from<br>
whence all other political rights come. One either beleives that<br>
political freedoms are gained by force, or that they are granted by God,<br>
and I don't see many theists round here.<br>
