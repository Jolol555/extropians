How?  Artsem a few chimps using some sperm.  It would seem extremely<br>
simple and could be done without leaving much evidence behind.  It<br>
could be done in the wild, which creates monitoring problems, but would<br>
probably be much easier than incurring the wrath of preservationists.<br>
<p>
However, just because there is genetic relatedness does not guarantee<br>
the production of offspring.  And remember mules are sterile.  This<br>
creates a problem if you want -- and I do! -- the uplift to be a fire and<br>
forget sort of affair.  (No pun intended.:)<br>
