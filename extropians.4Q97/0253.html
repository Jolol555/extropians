Those disbelievers! They refuse to worship _The Only True God, The God<br>
of Free Marketship_ [TM]. How dare they? How can anyone refuse to live<br>
in a barbarian wild west society, where it's "eat or be eaten"? How can<br>
anyone refuse to accept the fact that freedom is a invaluable good whose<br>
existence does not need to be proven? How can anyone deny that, since<br>
communism has failed, capitalism is immortal? How can anyone believe,<br>
that, with the absence of governments, monopolies could form and gain<br>
more power than they ever had before?<br>
<p>
How can anyone deny the beauty and inner art of trade? How can anyone be<br>
disgusted by the idea that personal property is holy and may be defended<br>
with all means? How can anyone claim that our decisions are based on the<br>
information we consume? How can anyone doubt that everyone has to earn a<br>
living, and those who don't weren't able to and have to _die_? How can<br>
anyone deny that this is derived from nature, that it is evolution? How<br>
can anyone dare to speak against the words of the prophets with the holy<br>
names "Smith" and "Friedman"? <br>
<p>
The answer: By thinking.<br>
