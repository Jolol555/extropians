<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; It should be noted that the main reason for desert spreading today are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  grazing and mismanaged agriculture, but this means spreading the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  desert outside its "natural" borders.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I saw a show that said the Sahara is expanding south at 7 miles per year, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; seemed to me that they were inferring that this was due to natural processes</i><br>
<i>&gt; of atmosphere and temperature rising (well except for possible human global</i><br>
<i>&gt; warming)</i><br>
<p>
They might have implied that (not inferred it -- the LISTENER infers <br>
from what the SPEAKER implies), but the best evidence says that the <br>
current growth of the Sahara is essentially 100% caused by local <br>
agricultural practices.  The local increase in temperature is a side <br>
effect of the local agricultural practices.<br>
<p>
The major media in the US have for years been on this big hype about <br>
global warming.  It's the latest upcoming disaster demanding major <br>
imposition of government control on everything except the major <br>
media.  When I was in high school (I'm gonna date myself now) there <br>
was a big flap over the desperate need for immediate <br>
government-compelled action to stave off an upcoming ICE AGE.  Now, <br>
it's warming.  And people -- relatively well informed, college <br>
educated people -- have agreed in large numbers that local increases <br>
in average temperature over the last few decades  were a result of <br>
human-caused global warming, when the fact was that over the last few <br>
decades the average temperature in their area had DECREASED.<br>
<p>
I don't know if the old ice-age scare is real (I kind of doubt it -- <br>
and I see *no* reason to believe that we need any <br>
government-mandated action of any kind), but to me it looks a lot <br>
more plausible and better supported by the evidence than human-caused <br>
global warming is.<br>
