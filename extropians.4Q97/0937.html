The determination that the core may be a large iron crystal was due to the<br>
anisotropic propagation of seismic waves through the core.   The<br>
differences in propagation speeds were consistent with the propagation of<br>
seismic waves through large crystals.  Additionally, there was a high<br>
correlation between the collected seismic propagation data, and the data<br>
generated via a computer model assuming a single large iron crystal in a<br>
HCP lattice.  An HCP lattice is the most likely structure for an iron<br>
crystal (which also exhibits FCC and BCC lattices) under the conditions<br>
expected in the core.<br>
