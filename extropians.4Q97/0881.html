In a message dated 97-10-27 18:43:14 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Anyway, Ive known about the crystal being in the center, thats really<br>
cool,<br>
<i> &gt;im sure it has all sorts of implications/potentials, having effects on</i><br>
<i> &gt;different wave/frequency/magnetic spectrums etc...</i><br>
 <br>
 Oh, I knew I would regret that comment.  There's nothing mystical about the<br>
 core according to this theory; it's just a big electromagnet made of a<br>
 material<br>
 absent at the surface of the earth but quite mundane in the core.<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well, you did acknowledge its potential on the magnetic spectrum, isn't that<br>
what I was suggesting?  Did I say anything mystical?  Now perhaps the<br>
magnetic field is related to/or affected by the fact that it is a crystal and<br>
not just a ball, and who's to say other fields arent affected as well?  The<br>
electromagnetic field comes to mind.  Now something could be interpreted as<br>
mystical due to the fact that the human brain is also an electromagnetic<br>
field, but thats up to you.<br>
<p>
Now yall, WHAT is wrong with this post? I dont see anything, except totally<br>
legit questions and ideas.  Filter it if you want.<br>
