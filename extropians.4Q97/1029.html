<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Today, humans are by no means perfect. They have a certain idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; what they do and what the consequences are, but it happens quite often</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that something "impredictable" happens. If you apply changes to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; ecologic system, can you really predict what consequences this will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the long run - and would you take the responsibility?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We cannot predict the long-term consequences of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; actions. Period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is that a proven fact? I mean: will it NEVER be possible, even with</i><br>
<i>&gt; superintelligence?</i><br>
<p>
I don't have the time to answer at length, but I think one can make a<br>
very good case for the existence of actions whose outcome even Jupiter<br>
brains cannot predict accurately. There are a lot of processes that<br>
are simply chaotic and will microscopic perturbations (or lack of<br>
information) will cause divergence from our prediction of them (the<br>
canonical example is the weather). Then there are the processes that<br>
are strictly undecidable, such as the halting problem in computer<br>
science: it is impossible to create a general algorithm to determine<br>
whether a given computer program halts or not. Since these two classes<br>
of problems could well be hidden inside the consequence prediction<br>
problem, it is most likely in general impossible to predict the long<br>
term consequences of our actions even for SI.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe short-term predictions will be sufficient as we gain more control</i><br>
<i>&gt; over nature. What about simulating ecologic, economic, social etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems? Today, we may not have enough computing power (and probably not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right theories and algorithms, either), but wouldn't this be a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable field for research?</i><br>
<p>
It certainly would. I think we can at least avoid some of the most<br>
obvious in retrospect disasters this way. With evolutionary modelling<br>
we might even notice some of the more nonlinear dangers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My idea was to give the computer a program that can deal with as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; data as available, start a simulation and see how similar the results in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the simulation are to those in reality. That'll give you a basis to</i><br>
<i>&gt; improve.</i><br>
<p>
A good start, but simulations can fool you. It is always possible to<br>
make a simulation conform to reality, but it may become brittle and<br>
overtrained: when confronted with *real* data instead of the data it<br>
has been tested on it simply doesn't work. This is why we neural<br>
network people always try to validate our models a lot by giving them<br>
previously unknown data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been thinking about the "education" problem today. I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; education is the ONLY thing I'd be willing to pay taxes for. Good</i><br>
<i>&gt; education should be freely available to all human beings. I don't care</i><br>
<i>&gt; if a "government" or another company takes care of that, but it has to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be done much better than today!</i><br>
<p>
I couldn't agree more!<br>
