<i>&gt;&gt;What gives?  Murder and brain-wiping are okay for godlike cyberbeings</i><br>
who know all about evolution?<br>
<p>
whos to say really.. sounds to me like they were trying to show (during the<br>
short duration of the film) that the being was indeed growing and learning<br>
what it needed to evolve. Remember that even us primitive humans are mere<br>
barbarians who will possibly learn someday the pursuit of<br>
intellectual/emotional fulfilment is more important than killing and hating<br>
eachother.<br>
<p>
<p>
Even though this film had more than one hole in it, I found it a great<br>
flick. I only wish there were more like it. I just purchased another<br>
(non-cyborg/posthuman) cartoon. The original animated movie form of Spawn.<br>
Quite possibly the most violent animation I've ever seen, but pretty cool<br>
despite..<br>
