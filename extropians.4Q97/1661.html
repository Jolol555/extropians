<i>&gt; Climate-ecosystem interactions are even more iffy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For instance, I've read in several locations that the reason the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sahara is a desert, now, rather than a prairie, is because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; centuries of sheep grazing.</i><br>
<p>
I think it is a slight bit more complex than that. During the ice age<br>
the convection cells were somewhat different, and instead of just<br>
moving the humid air of the tropics above the Sahara they dropped the<br>
moisture there, creating a thriving ecosystem. When the climate<br>
shifted, the area dried up. Here is the part I'm uncertain of: did the<br>
Sahara immediately become a desert or did it do so due to grazing? It<br>
is not inconceivable that a large prarie could remain stable,<br>
especially since it affects the climate in turn, but sooner or later<br>
it may tunnel to the even more stable desert state. Whether this push<br>
was through grazing or a natural fluctuation I don't know (I lean<br>
towards the natural side, since there are plenty of deserts at that<br>
latitude around the world that seems to have appeared independently).<br>
<p>
It should be noted that the main reason for desert spreading today are<br>
grazing and mismanaged agriculture, but this means spreading the<br>
desert outside its "natural" borders.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; created by flooding coastlines.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. Personally I think we ought to terraform Mars first so that<br>
we learn the ropes before tackling the Earth (although I consider<br>
planets a waste of matter, but that is just personal opinion).<br>
