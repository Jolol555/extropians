<i>&gt; &gt; The real question is this: will we see a failing of Moore's law in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; I think it's a fault to focus too much on Moores law. The funny thing is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that nobody AFAIK has ever meassured the actual performance of a</i><br>

<i>&gt; gates.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about in two years time when the new computer systems will be able</i><br>

<i>&gt; two years more xDSL will probably be pretty common, so everybody will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to have their own tv station. Well in theory at least.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These things are not happening because of doubling in processor power,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but because of changes in existing technology.</i><br>
<p>
What changes are those? Your full media bandwidth would not be possible<br>
without the processor power capable of handling that fat a signal in<br>
realtime. Moore's Law is used by industry to plan release of both<br>
hardware and software technologies to match consumer price expectations<br>
without taking a bath.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Internet would have happened on a Commodore 64, if that had been the</i><br>
<i>&gt; top level in computer sophistication possible.</i><br>
<p>
BUt what then?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying that the effects of Moores law are not important but</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology consist of two parts: hardware and methods. (In Danish theres</i><br>
<i>&gt; a better way of putting it: Teknologi = Teknik + Metoder)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that generally there's far to much focus on the hardware side of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the equation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Oh granted, bloatware is the biggest drag on the technology right now in<br>
terms of speed. However, the only way to chop it down without giving up<br>
capability is to dump all the filters that make it compatible with older<br>
data and file formats. This is why its always better to keep your fonts<br>
packed away, and not load so many file conversion filters except those<br>
you actually use, as well as minimize the number that you do use. If you<br>
don't like that, tough, thats the price of omniscience.<br>
