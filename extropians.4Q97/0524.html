<p>
Although it's a good idea to remember that fretting about these<br>
things too much can throw our nervous systems into a depressive<br>
biochemical funk which can decrease our ability to work against<br>
these unpleasant possibilities (remember your dynamic<br>
optimism!), I have to agree with you that these are very real<br>
possibilities, and that this is probably what gives my<br>
political opinions a sense of urgency to me.<br>
<p>
I think things will turn out okay as long as no one group or<br>
individual succeeds in using massive organized force to try to<br>
get other people to change their behavior in the direction<br>
preferred by that group or individual.  Unfortunately, such use<br>
of massive organized force is the *NORM* under which we live on<br>
this planet.  That does worry me.<br>
<p>
Essentially, who can possibly stop us from achieving the dreams<br>
we talk about here?  In the long run, the only serious threat I<br>
can perceive comes from other Homo sapiens.  Specifically, the<br>
subset of Homo sapiens engaged in the system known as<br>
government.  Any effective opposition, I think, will end up<br>
being channelled through there.<br>
