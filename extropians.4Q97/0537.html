<i>&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky [SMTP:sentience@pobox.com]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My point is not necessarily that a given technology is feasible, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly not that it is feasible to us.=A0 The Unbreakable-Limits</i><br>
<i>&gt; position</i><br>
<i>&gt; says:=A0 "Such-and-such is theoretically and mathematically =</i><br>
impossible<br>
<i>&gt; under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws of physics, in the same sense that you cannot add two even</i><br>
numbers<br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; get an odd number".=A0 I simply point out that the current, known =</i><br>
laws<br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; physics make the limit a practical, rather than a theoretical, =</i><br>
one.=A0<br>
The<br>
<i>&gt; Constraintarians are reduced to saying:=A0 "Well, sure, it's</i><br>
theoretically<br>
<i>&gt; possible, but I don't think it's practical."=A0 Well, but then the =</i><br>
SIs<br>
may<br>
<i>&gt; think</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise.=A0 You are no longer arguing that a given end is =</i><br>
impossible<br>
<i>&gt; under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Laws Of Physics (which change all the time, anyway).=A0 You are =</i><br>
arguing<br>
<i>&gt; that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible end is not achieveable - because *we* can't think of any way</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt; do it.</i><br>
<p>
Right.=A0 Understood.=A0 However you're making a straw-man of my =<br>
original<br>
post: I was very explicit in communicating that a future being might =<br>
see<br>
past these apparent limitations.=A0 But simply waving away the =<br>
discussion<br>
by saying "we don't know, we're not smart enough" is sticking your head<br>
in the sand.=A0 Let's think creatively about how we can apply our =<br>
limited<br>
intellects to glean at least /some/ understanding of the future.=A0 I'm<br>
sure you have dozens of suspicions of what things will be like (in some<br>
limited sphere) 50 years from now, and strong supporting arguments for<br>
each of them.=A0 That's the stuff I'd like to hear, rather than =<br>
constant<br>
cries of "some smarter future being will figure /everything/ out".<br>
<p>
On a totally separate note, nice to talk to you again, Eli.=A0 It's =<br>
always<br>
entertaining and enlightening, to say the least!<br>
