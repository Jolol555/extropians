<i>&gt; From:          "Michael M. Butler" &lt;mbutler@comp*lib.org&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, regarding hemp qua fuel: inasmuch as hemp still has to be cultivated,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's an energy cost associated with that. Assuming hemp is as efficient as</i><br>
<i>&gt; soybeans at generating oil (that seems like a conservative estimate), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; assuming similar cultivation/processing costs (not sure this is true), a first</i><br>
<i>&gt; approximation of the energy credit (or debt) ought to be easily calculable. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have the numbers at present. But we don't see a lot of soybean-powered</i><br>
<i>&gt; cars, do we? Now if hemp were incredibly better as a fuel, or incredibly cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt; to cultivate, this use might still pan out. I'm curious to know if the book you</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention goes into this, or just handwaves about it.</i><br>
<p>
I don't have the numbers either, but I know that from all <br>
appearances, hemp is pretty easy and cheap to grow if you don't have <br>
to hide it from the police.<br>
<p>
But fundamentally, hemp -- or soybean -- oil as a substitute for <br>
gasoline, isn't going to happen for a while because they are <br>
solutions to a non-problem.  Solutions that have to compete against <br>
an existing infrastructure which has no apparent need to accommodate <br>
them, and without the ability to provide any apparent advantages.<br>
<p>
Now, it is a given that eventually we will run out of fossil fuels.  <br>
When the supply actually runs low enough to drive the cost of <br>
fossil-fuel-derived gasoline high enough, something will be done.  <br>
Today, though, we are not at that point and we have no reason to <br>
believe we're anywhere particularly close to it.<br>
<p>
And unless someone in the meantime finds it worthwhile to put a major <br>
effort into tuning external-combustion engines (what we should have <br>
done in the first place), the "something" that will most likely be <br>
done is finding a way to make gasoline from some other raw material.  <br>
Perhaps hemp oil or soybean oil.<br>
