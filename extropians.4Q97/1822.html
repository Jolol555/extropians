<i>&gt; I haven't read it for a while, but Dennett made a case in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Consciousness Explained' that red is not a physical phenomenon but</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely a tag which we attach to certain stimuli.</i><br>
<p>
	But think about this.  What is this "tag" that you talk of?<br>
Why is it?  What is it like?<br>
<p>
	In consciousness explained Dennet claims we don't really have<br>
qualia "...it just seems that we do".  But what is such a false<br>
"seeming"?<br>
<p>
	For a representationalist, a false seeming is an internal<br>
representation in the mind that does not accurately model what it<br>
represents.  A mirage is something in the mind that does not<br>
accurately represent what is beyond the eyes.  That is why it only<br>
"seems" that there is water out there.  There is a representation of<br>
water in our mind, but no real water beyond our eyes.<br>
<p>
	According to this Dennett's statement is self contradictory.<br>
He is saying we don't have representations, we just have false<br>
representations that represent such which of course is absurd and self<br>
contradictory.  If Dennet intends some non representationalist meaning<br>
for "seem" he should more explicitly explain what it is he means.<br>
What, why, and how, is this knowledge that is our seeming that is<br>
incorrect?  It must be something in order for it to be incorrect<br>
right?  If it was nothing how could it be incorrect or correct?<br>
<p>
	If it is merely a "tag" what how and why is this tag?  And<br>
most importantly, what is this tag really fundamentally and<br>
phenomenally like.<br>
