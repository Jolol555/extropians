Many are confused by my last post under the heading,<br>
"What TWA 800 HOAX,"  for by republishing one of my<br>
reports it appeared I was recommitting the crime of<br>
advocating the Navy-missile theory again. Not true:<br>
<p>
   The confusion stems from CNN's misrepresentation.<br>
<p>
   It's true that I said I was sorry and apologized <br>
   for my promotion of the Navy-missile theory. But <br>
   it's false that I said anything I did was a sham, <br>
   plot, or hoax, as the media reported. There's a <br>
   world of difference between saying my promotion <br>
   of a theory was a mistake and that it was a fraud. <br>
<p>
   THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FACTS AND THEORIES<br>
<p>
   If they're going to say the case I assembled <br>
   was a sham, as they are, then I will present <br>
   the case and ask "So where's the sham?" All I <br>
   see are a list of factual items from which a <br>
   theory is extrapolated. A theory derived from <br>
   a set of facts may be true or false, even as <br>
   the facts are all true. I stand behind those <br>
   facts (<a href="http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard">http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard</a>) <br>
   even as I discontinue to advocate the theory. <br>
   There's absolutely no contradiction there.<br>
<p>
   When I say I stand by my case,  I say that <br>
   it was a legitimate case, that it was built <br>
   upon facts that tend to support the theory.<br>
   Nobody can refute the facts it rests upon,<br>
   but we can disagree over what they mean.<br>
<p>
   (a) Crisp facts and (b) fuzzy theories.<br>
   I stand by (a) but no longer espouse<br>
   any (b). I also never blurred the<br>
   line between (a) and (b) as has<br>
   been widely misreported.<br>
<p>
   The Navy-missile case is a case of circumstantial <br>
   evidence, which some might call a compelling case.<br>
<p>
   HOWEVER:<br>
<p>
   Just because 154 people saw what is <br>
   best described as a missile, and just<br>
   because  there was  Navy activity in <br>
   the area, which the Navy initially <br>
   denied but then admitted when the <br>
   radar tapes came out,  does not <br>
   necessarily mean the Navy shot<br>
   down TWA 800 with a missile.<br>
 <br>
   I have always been aware of that fact, but, <br>
   wanting to end my TWA 800 analysis forever,<br>
   I felt it proper to apologize to those in <br>
   the gov't I had caste suspicion upon, for<br>
   they could be innocent... I don't know.?<br>
   If I want to free myself from the case,<br>
   I should free all those in the case.<br>
<p>
   But they did not want to free me,<br>
   forcing me to keep the case up to<br>
   counter the false charge of fraud.<br>
<p>
   It's regrettable that CNN felt it necessary<br>
   to wrongfully frame me has having admitted<br>
   fraud. For some reason they are desperate<br>
   to sink the Navy-missile theory and me.<br>
<p>
   Dr. Stern has made the case available once <br>
   again so that people can see there was no <br>
   sham: http:/www.copi.com/article/Goddard<br>
