Hal forwarded, from the EPA:<br>
<i>&gt; Although scientists have incontrovertible evidence that the surfaces</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the land and oceans have been warming,</i><br>
<p>
Uh, perhaps. I'm fairly convinced about ozone depletion because we<br>
can see precisely what's going on in the atmosphere; but in this case<br>
all we have are old measurements which may not be very accurate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; some scientists are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet convinced that the atmosphere is also warming.  but as the figure</i><br>
<i>&gt; shows, the 1979-95 data series may be too short to show the trend.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately they don't show the figure. They do show another figure<br>
on another page which claims the surface increased in temperature by<br>
0.6F in that time, which rather seems to contradict the atmospheric<br>
data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thus, even the surface temperature measurements--which show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; steady warming trend over the last century--do not show much of a warming</i><br>
<i>&gt; trend when one only considers data since 1979.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, their own graphs show 0.6F increase at the surface since 1979. See<br>
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/index.html">http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/index.html</a>.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Balloon data, which shows</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same absence of warming over the 1979-95 period shows a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; warming trend from 1958 to 1993.</i><br>
<p>
Their own graphs show a large temperature peak around 1941; on this<br>
basis we could imply that 1958 was a particularly cold year, and hence<br>
the warming is merely a coincidence. And I'm still puzzled as to how<br>
the same set of data could show warming from 1958-1993 but cooling from<br>
1979-1995; if it was only a few years, perhaps, but 1979 is close to<br>
the midpoint of that range.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Measurement errors associated with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; new technology, and cyclical variations in temperature due to El Ninos,</i><br>
<p>
Variations accounted for, errors checked against balloon measurements.<br>
<p>
Hal added:<br>
<i>&gt;We know that two decades is not really enough to expect to see a clear</i><br>
<i>&gt;trend, and apparently it happened that the beginning of the interval was</i><br>
<i>&gt;unusually warm, swamping the trend. </i><br>
<p>
But that would imply that natural processes in the atmosphere can<br>
swamp artificial changes, and hence global warming is a non-issue<br>
anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Expanding the time frame as shown</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the balloon measurements does appear to confirm the warming trend.</i><br>
<p>
Did you find a source for those? They just state it and don't provide<br>
a link. I'll check the NASA site.<br>
