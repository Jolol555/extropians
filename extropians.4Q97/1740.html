<i>&gt;&gt;If you don't consider uplift at least as risky as working with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;bioweapons... _why_?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because we are dealing with a multicellular animal.  Much easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt;control than current microbes.  Also, the octopus is a marine</i><br>
<i>&gt;animal.  Despite its escape artist skills, it will be much easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt;control such an organism, which is less likely to, say, escape to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the oceans from my apartment than, say, an uplifted rabbit or dog.</i><br>
<p>
For the record, I'm speaking boldly in these matters because it's important<br>
that someone do it. I don't mind sounding foolish.<br>
<p>
These are points I figured you'd mention, and they seem sound. But permit<br>
me to remind you that microbes don't think for themselves, and as far as we<br>
know don't take an interest in their whereabouts.<br>
<p>
I don't know if you're familiar with Dr. Fouts' work with the signing<br>
chimpanzees (including the famous Washoe). One of the points he raised in<br>
discussions with me was that the chimps were all stuck in an environment<br>
not unlike a prison camp. How grateful/cooperative/happy/docile do you<br>
think the organisms you choose to uplift will be? Or are you just thinking<br>
of the final result? This is another reason, perhaps, to prefer mammals--I<br>
suspect people can learn to "read" them easier. OTOH, a chimp with a pull<br>
strength of half a ton could dismember a human if it ever seemed like a<br>
really good idea, and Fouts still had all his arms &amp; legs last time I saw<br>
him. :)<br>
<p>
Daniel, I'm not just worried about a team of red octopi storming the<br>
streets outside your apartment armed with steak knives and carrying<br>
sandwich-bag knapsacks of seawater (:)). I'm concerned that you not blind<br>
yourself to _possible_ real danger to _yourself_ should you start to succeed. <br>
