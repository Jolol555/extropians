 As much as I agree with you, Ian, if you aren't going to file a lawsuit<br>
 against the press and the FBI, then just give it up. You have already<br>
 made the Missile Theory synonymous with terms like The Grassy Knoll,<br>
 Roswell, etc. so you have accomplished something. Ranting on and on on a<br>
 mailing list is not doing you any favors in improving your tarnished<br>
 image, and is starting  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Sigh....I think I agree...<br>
<p>
I think Ian is correct...but sometimes the truth is NOT acceptable...<br>
<p>
So give it up.<br>
