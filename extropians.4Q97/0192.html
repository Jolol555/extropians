<p>
Better than the alternatives of private war and buyout is the<br>
possibility of second-level arbitration between the two PPLs.<br>
Our present-day archaic monopoly-law-providers have multiple<br>
levels of appeal... I'm not sure why people find multiple<br>
levels of arbitration so difficult to visualize in a<br>
non-monopolized system of law production.<br>
<p>
In practice, such second-level arbitration would probably amount<br>
to arbitrage of the buyout proceedings, but would probably be more<br>
efficient and less unpleasant for all concerned.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  Ding ding[1]!  That's the point of my devil's advocacy: what if</i><br>
<i> &gt;  there's a better system we haven't discovered?  Or more usefully,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  that has been discovered but not understood or publicized?  Yes,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  perfect competition is maximally efficient,</i><br>
<p>
One of the things I like about the Austrians among economists<br>
is that most of them are very careful *not* to base their<br>
arguments on assumptions of perfect competition or perfect<br>
information.  Some less sophisticated students of classical<br>
economics seem to think that markets require perfect<br>
information (a condition closely related to perfect<br>
competition) in order to work; Austrians on the other hand see<br>
the market as being *productive* of information.  It requires<br>
some information to work, but it does not require perfect<br>
information in order to improve the quality of the information<br>
(accuracy of the price signals) flowing through it.<br>
<p>
One of the problems I have in arguing with left-anarchists (and<br>
I used to be one) is that by refusing to acknowledge the<br>
desirability of a fairly uniform social institution of physical<br>
property in the first place, it's hard to get them to care<br>
about the accuracy of price signals.  Without accurate price<br>
signals, I doubt that Great Societies (such as the one we are<br>
living in at present) can stably persist.  I doubt that it is<br>
possible to stably provide enough food for six billion mammals<br>
as large as we are without good price signals.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  Careful; they call themselves libertarians too.  And have prior</i><br>
<i> &gt;  use of the term -- both terms -- to boot.  Which by our definition</i><br>
<i> &gt;  of property -- prior acquisition -- means that we've been trespassing</i><br>
<i> &gt;  and should find terms other than "libertarian" or "anarchist" to</i><br>
<i> &gt;  describe ourselves.  Anarcho-capitalist, for example.</i><br>
<p>
Now you are *really* confusing the issue.  First you raise the<br>
left-anarchists purported distinction between personal and<br>
private property, and then you go clouding the much more vital<br>
distinction between physical property and intellectual<br>
property. On intellectual property issues, I am still very<br>
sympathetic to the left-anarchists, and my indignant reaction<br>
to IP laws (which seem to me to be ways of slanting the playing<br>
field in favor of those people who *already* have a cognitive<br>
advantage over most of the other players... horribly<br>
"regressive" in old left terms) may have been what got me<br>
confused in the first place.<br>
<p>
I suspect that the institution of private property in physical<br>
objects and regions is one of our species great serendipitous<br>
and inadvertent inventions, like money and language.  It's<br>
difficult enough without confusing that institution with the<br>
much more recent and deliberately (not spontaneously)<br>
originated voodoo notions of "intellectual property".<br>
<p>
(This is intended as a philosophical point: I don't have any rancor<br>
against those who make their living selling intellectual property,<br>
even if they use current laws to enforce their claims.  We all have<br>
to compromise with the state sometimes, so I try to refrain from<br>
too vigorously finding fault in that department.)<br>
