After Tony Hollick, our resident crackpot, showed he was ignorant enough to <br>
publicly malign Richard Feynman, one of the greatest men of the 20'th century, <br>
and offensive enough to do it in front of his son, I resolved to take Carl's <br>
advice about people who refuse to learn and just ignore his babbling, but<br>
Hollick's last post was so stupid my resolve weakened.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture'      </i><br>

<i>      &gt;reified' mathematical approach.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the comic book approach to physics <br>
(i.e. your preference); and the intelligent mathematical approach <br>
(i.e. Feynman's preference).<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Electrons held in orbit by a balance of electric force against         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;inertia </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
That's idiotic. The electron has very little inertia, the smallest mass of <br>
any non zero particle. Because the proton in an atom is so  near, the <br>
electron feels a huge force tugging it into the nucleus. Even the tiny force <br>
exerted by a feather could move an iceberg the size of a mountain if you give <br>
it enough time, yet we know that matter has been stable for billions of years. <br>
Not that you'd need billions of years, the electron's mass is so small and <br>
the force of attraction toward the proton is so strong that if classical <br>
physics were correct the electron would crash into the nucleus in much less <br>
than a nanosecond.<br>
<p>
And that's far from your only problem. All the protons in the nucleus have <br>
the same charge and are even closer together, the repellent force they  <br>
experience is truly astronomical, yet the nucleus does not fly apart and the <br>
thing that stops it sure as hell isn't inertia, it's the strong nuclear  force.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>          &gt;are in a condition which is analogous to 'free fall.' They're not     </i><br>
<i>          &gt;accelerating in a way which causes emission of photons.      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If something is falling it is by definition accelerating and if charges <br>
moving in a circle are not accelerating in " a way which causes emission of <br>
photons" then when electrons move in a large circle in one of our high energy  <br>
laboratories they shouldn't radiate photons but they do, and the effect is <br>
not subtle, the radiation is massive. The classical laws that work so well <br>
when the electrons move in a circle many meters in diameter are useless when <br>
you talk about the atom.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Does anyonwe here think that geometry is _empirically decideable_?</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Is this a debatable point, does anyone here really think that the geometry of <br>
the universe in which we live is not empirically  decideable_?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>     &gt;There's no point in quoting Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a     </i><br>
<i>     &gt;(non-existent) aether to  transmit forces</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Let's see, Maxwell was  wrong, Huygens misled, Einstein was an idiot, Bohr <br>
was a little slow, Hawking is ignorant, Copernicus was a plagiarist as was <br>
Feynman, the second law of thermodynamics is an evil plot, relativity is <br>
foolishness and quantum mechanics a con game. Sounds like you'd be happy with<br>
physics as it was around 1840, unless that's not going far enough and you <br>
think that punk Newton shouldn't have tried to improve on Aristotle.<br>
<p>
Your theory is that all the great physicists in at least the last 150 years <br>
didn't know what they were talking about, but there is an alternate theory, <br>
Tony Hollick doesn't know what he's talking about.<br>
