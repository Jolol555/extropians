Are you Kelly McGillis or a Tony Hollick writing under a pseudonym (or vice<br>
versa)?  Either way, I really enjoyed your anecdote.  It reminds me of<br>
myself a lot.  Happy Holidays and seasons Greetings!  -Bill.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;From Kelly McGillis:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was at my hometown over the weekend and it was that time of early</i><br>
<i>&gt; boring afternoon when recreational drugs are frowned upon, so I busied</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself with quantum physics and the God Particle.  I was surrounded with</i><br>
<i>&gt; my personal version of mathematical formulas when I was asked if I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; babysit a whole slew of children while the mothers went on a shopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; expidition.  I jumped at the opportunity, realizing that with all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical adults out of the house, I could indulge somewhat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Soon I realized there were so many children running around the place</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I didn't know what to do. They were totally out of control.  So I</i><br>
<i>&gt; just shrugged and went back to my quantum physics.  I was at the point</i><br>
<i>&gt; of proving that a wormhole existed in my brain when there was a HUGE</i><br>
<i>&gt; crash.  It occured to me that perhaps the little ones were actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroying my mother's house, so I jumped up and yelled "HEY!" and put</i><br>
<i>&gt; my arm up like a police officer stopping traffic.  They immediately came</i><br>
<i>&gt; to attention. "Don't you know that people who live in stone houses don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; throw bricks!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Yeah," one of em said, "And don't you know people who live in houses</i><br>
<i>&gt; with Christmas trees shouldn't throw presents!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Well, that would be stupid, breaking a present before you even opened</i><br>
<i>&gt; it!  The fun is breaking them *after* you open them!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A tiny one was pulling on my leg.  "Aunt Kelly?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "And who are you," I said.  "Do you belong to this family? Or did you</i><br>
<i>&gt; sneak in?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I'm...I'm..I'mmm..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I knew it!  Not only do I have a wormhole in my brain, you are not my</i><br>
<i>&gt; nieces and nephews!  YOU'RE REPLICATING BEHIND MY BACK!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I'm...I'mmmm..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Good lord child, don't you know how to talk?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Tory!  I'mmm Tory!  And stoooopid is a bad word Aunt Kelly."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I eyed her suspiciously. This one was a replicant for sure.  Then they</i><br>
<i>&gt; all started yelling at me that stooooopid was a bad word.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Okay, replicants!  That's enough!  Where are my real nieces and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nephews?  What idiot told you stuooopid was a bad word?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Their teachers.  Their parents.  Every adult on the face of earth except</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, I discovered.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Well, then, I'll just have to teach you a new word.  Say after me:</i><br>
<i>&gt; REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSSS.  Use that word instead of stupid, OK?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Aunt Kelly?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Yes," I said warming up to the topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "YOU ARE REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSS!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Hey!  Who do you think you are?  A McGillis?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The parents thankfully arrived back and were appalled at the mess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Their kids, not my prob, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of my ridiculous sisters-in-law had the nerve to ask me when I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to have children.  "NEVER!" I replied.  "It's my mission in life</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be an aunt!  And its a mission I think I excel at!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Yeah, and she's even got worms in her brain!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "That, you little replicant, is a worm hole!"</i><br>
