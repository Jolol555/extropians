Once you have a fitness function you can do gradient ascent and add <br>
noise to avoid getting stuck on local maxima; in principle you could <br>
even do an exhaustive search. However, if this is to work for the <br>
average person with the superfast computer, as in my formulation of <br>
the problem, then we would need to find a way to formalize the <br>
success criteria. We must teach him to write a progam that evaluates <br>
whether a given evolved network is intelligent or not; because it <br>
would take too long if he were to do the evaluation manually. So how <br>
can we formalize a criterion for intelligence? (A given IQ test like <br>
the Raven Progessive Matricies wouldn't work in this case, since a <br>
network would evolve that would answer those particular questions in <br>
an ad hoc manner, but wouldn't generalize to other problems.)<br>
