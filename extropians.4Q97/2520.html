OK, here's the tally as of 8:30 pm EST, Monday, Dec 15th.<br>
<p>
NOTE: To reiterate a previous post, the only reason I compared the<br>
American subscribers to the stats I had on American Gun ownership in<br>
last nights tally was simply to compare apples to apples as much as<br>
possible. I don't have gun ownership figures for the rest of the world,<br>
or for other specific countries. THose that have such stats are welcome<br>
to post them. I did note that there were 3 non-American, non-gun owners,<br>
two of which have since said that they would, if they could live in<br>
America, own a gun, so that kinda makes them ambivalent as far as<br>
ownership rights are concerned, while still being non-gun owners.<br>
<p>
The current numbers:<br>
<p>
Gun Owners | tot. guns owned | Would if they could | non-owners<br>
<p>
15     |       105         |          4        |         8<br>
<p>
As to nationality:<br>
<p>
Americans:  13  |  95   |   0    |   3<br>
Non-Americans:  2   |  10   |   4   |   5<br>
<p>
I won't break down the nationalities further, for fear of inadvertently,<br>
indirectly violating privacy.<br>
<p>
I think that it's interesting that there is such a large group of<br>
non-Americans who, willingly or unwillingly, could be considered to be<br>
politically repressed for not being able to exercise their rights of<br>
self defense. I doubt we'll hear anything from Amnesty International on<br>
this anytime soon. ;)<br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker is right that as a self appointed sampling, this<br>
survey is hardly "statistically valid" in that it only applies to<br>
subscribers to the list, but only as a representation of those that may<br>
share extropian values but are not subscribers. In that we are hearing<br>
directly from subscribers, I think that it is a decent indication of the<br>
demographics of those currently involved in the list, and as a<br>
comparison of current subscribing extropians to the general population,<br>
it is valid, as much as any readership surveys compiled by any<br>
group/publication, etc.  is.<br>
<p>
As to those who are "ambivalent" about gun ownership, I would suggest<br>
that if the only reason you want to own a gun is for self defense<br>
against criminals, then you are doing it for, not what I'd say is the<br>
wrong reason, but more for not the best reason. <br>
<p>
Homer Simpson said, "Guns are for three things: defending your family,<br>
killing deeelicious animals, and keeping King George out of your face!"<br>
<p>
WHich reason is the best one????<br>
