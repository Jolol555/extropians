I've read Miller, and having done an emotional healing workshop based in<br>
part on Janov's "primal therapy", I think that whole approach is<br>
basically along the right lines.  It's pretty clear that one simply<br>
*learns* a violent way of life in a violent family, and the pain of<br>
being constantly subjected to voilence as a child has serious repercussions<br>
in adult life. (Everyone ought to read what Miller discovered about<br>
Hitler's childhood.  The poor kid really did have a terribly hard time.)<br>
<p>
But there are some complications: for example, if we're saying that<br>
torturing kids turns them violent how come the German burgher was so<br>
law-abiding? (Or was he? Is that just a myth? Or is it that all that<br>
pent-up burgher's aggression burst out in two World Wars?)<br>
<p>
19th century German pedagogical manuals are not in much use in 20th<br>
century America, yet American society seems to be more causally violent<br>
than 19th-20th century German society.  (Or is it?)  This would seem to<br>
point to other factors: what could they be?  (The thesis that, for<br>
example, in the case of Afro-American male violence, the lack of a<br>
father in broken Afro-American homes has something to do with it, bears<br>
examination.)<br>
<p>
Also, consider: women who are treated that way generally don't become<br>
outwardly physically violent - typically they turn that violence on<br>
themselves (intense lack of self-esteem, self-mutilation, etc.)  <br>
<p>
IOW, it seems that there's something about the male psyche under certain<br>
conditions that leads to the male adult being more likely to reflect<br>
childhood-conditioned violence outwards in physical form.  There does<br>
seem to be a genetic component (i.e. males are simply by nature more<br>
violent), and a cultural component (e.g. the "conditions" might include<br>
lack of good male role models in childhood).<br>
