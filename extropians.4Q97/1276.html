In a message dated 97-11-08 23:44:20 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The presently accepted view of what causes the earth's electromagnetic<br>
 field is that since the inner core rotates faster than the outer layers<br>
 like the mantle and crust at a rate of about one extra "day" per year of<br>
 rotation, the inner core acts as a rotor, and the mantle and crust as<br>
 the stator, in an electromagnetic generator. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Well...now another question arises...why.<br>
<p>
It's always "why" isn't it?  In this case why does the iron crystal/iron<br>
lattice core rotate at a different rate than the rest of the planet.  I can't<br>
see the moon having any effect...gravity would affect the earth equaly<br>
wouldn't it?<br>
<p>
<p>
In an earlier Post I wrote.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; And just to throw a nother bean into the stew...how does Gold's Primeval</i><br>
Oil<br>
<i>&gt; thesis tie into this?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And Anders Sandberg replied<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As far as I know, not at all. It is all about what happens up at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;crust, not down in the core.</i><br>
<p>
And Micheal Lorrey also replied.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What the hell is Gold's Primeval Oil thesis?????</i><br>
w <br>
me again...<br>
<p>
I don't know...for sure...but evidently anders is familiar with it...  what I<br>
think I  know has to do the the idea that oil is NOT the result of decayed<br>
dinosuars...but rather a part of all asteroids and space junk which fell<br>
together originally (primeval)..and coalesced to form the planet...The guy<br>
who come up with this idea was named Gold...I think...<br>
<p>
Vauge memory floating in the background so I thought I'd mention it...just<br>
wondered if there might be any relationship.<br>
<p>
Also you write.<br>
<p>
&lt;Any basic book on metallurgy can tell you more on this.<br>
<p>
No doubt...cept I live in my truck...a nice truck to be sure...but rather<br>
small living quarters...with limited library facilities.....and libraries and<br>
bookstores with parking for 18-wheelers are rather rare...(sometimes I<br>
cheat!!)...and try finding something like that in Barnes and Nobles or Books<br>
aMillion....the Science section is tensy by comparison to say...the UFO<br>
section...or  other...ugh...well just other...<br>
