<p>
I distinctly remember an incident about the U.S. Army, but I<br>
haven't been able to relocate the referrence. I do however also<br>
remember the incident you mention, and did locate that reference.<br>
Maybe one learned from the other?<br>
<p>
W.M. Denevan, "The Native Population of the Americas in 1492"<br>
(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1992).<br>
<p>
Smallpox may have been the most useful weapon of biological warfare<br>
in world history. European colonists repeatedly took advantage of<br>
the special susceptibility of the Amerindian population,<br>
deliberately spreading the deadly virus among Indians who were<br>
sucessfully defending their rights to the land and resources of the<br>
Americas. For example, in 1763 Sir Jeffery Amherst, commander in<br>
chief of all British forces in North America, was having great<br>
difficulty controlling the Pontiac Indians in the western<br>
territories. At Amherst's insistence, blankets innoculated with<br>
live smallpox viruses were distributed to the Pontiac, obliterating<br>
the tribe. The deliberately induced epidemic quickly spread to the<br>
northwest, claiming large numbers of Sioux and Plains Indians,<br>
crossed the Rockies and inflicted huge death tolls among Native<br>
Americans from southern California all the up to the Artic circle<br>
tribes of Alaska. This devastation was cited in the official WHO<br>
history of smallpox: Fenner,Henderson, Arita,et al,(1988) op.cit.<br>
<p>
I also found this in Laurie Garrett's "The Coming Plague":<br>
<p>
"According to historian Williams McNeill, Cortez's capture of<br>
Mexico City with just a small army of exhausted Spanish irregulars<br>
under his command was possible only because the Europeans had<br>
unknowingly spread smallpox throughout the land. When Cortez<br>
launched his final assault on the capitol, few Aztec soldiers were<br>
alive and well. Smallpox, together with measles, tuberculosis, and<br>
influenza, claimed an estimated 56 million Amerindian lives during<br>
the initial years of the Spanish conquest."<br>

Yikes....<br>
