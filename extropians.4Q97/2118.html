Hi.<br>
<p>
For those interested, here are some solid investments for 1998.  It is a<br>
good time to buy, as the market is still depressed from the recent slide.<br>
<p>
<p>
Cisco Systems (CSCO  ~$90/sh) :  The world's leading producer of network<br>
routers and switches (roughly 2/3 of the entire market) is climbing fast<br>
and for good reason.  The demand continues to grow as networks proliferate,<br>
and Cisco has virtually unstoppable market presence.  While pricey, this<br>
stock should continue to perform well for the foreseeable future.  This<br>
would be a good long term "value" investment.<br>
<p>
CUC International (CU  ~$30/sh) :  I've been watching this well-managed<br>
membership organization for a while.  However, the agreed upon merger<br>
between CUC and HFS ( Avis, Ramada, Century 21, et al ) is a match made in<br>
heaven.  The new organization (which will be called Cendant, I believe),<br>
will be able to snag customers (and profits) coming AND going.  CUC has<br>
also managed to smoothly move their $2.9 billion discount business to the<br>
Internet to great effect.  <br>
<p>
Intel (INTC  ~$78/sh) :  No matter which way you slice it, Intel's share of<br>
the total market is increasing.  With competition weakening from the clone<br>
vendors, and the pool of major architectures getting smaller, Intel is<br>
poised to become an even bigger force in the market as it moves into the<br>
high-end with the IA64.  Native architectures that will likely all but<br>
disappear from the desktop over the next 5 years: PA-RISC, Alpha, MIPS, and<br>
PowerPC.  Doesn't leave much, does it?<br>
<p>
Merck (MRK  ~$95/sh) :  Long considered a solid value investment, great<br>
things are expected of this company in 1998.  FDA approvals are expected in<br>
1998 for new drugs to treat baldness, asthma, and migraines.  Additionally,<br>
Merck's recent introduction of the drug Fosamax for osteoporosis is<br>
expected to rack up enormous sales.<br>
<p>
<p>
Updates regarding previously discussed stocks:<br>
<p>
Triquint Semiconductor (TQNT ~$20/sh) :  After getting slammed<br>
successively, first by an unexpected inventory glut, and second by the<br>
market slide, the market value of this company has suffered severely.<br>
However, this company still has strong support in the industry and<br>
continues to attract large deals with top wireless vendors.  Consensus now<br>
puts Triquint at $40-45 in 1998.  Earnings are expected to rebound sharply<br>
next year to $1.20-1.40/sh.<br>
