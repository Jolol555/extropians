       Hello!<br>
<p>
      I'm Tony Hollick &lt;Anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk&gt;  0117-9098918<br>
<p>
<p>
      I'm presently in dispute with British Telecom.<br>
<p>
  For a year and more, I had an ordinary residential account - 0117 9501894<br>
<p>
<p>
 I was billed on a monthly basis, and likewise paid in full, monthly.<br>
<p>
<p>
 Lately, I've had occasion to use the telephone rather more.<br>
<p>
<p>
[I] I am an occasional adviser to NATO's Technical Directorate:  We're <br>
endeavouring to resolve the critical problems of 'backdoors' in Windows95, <br>
whereby if Windows95 user [A] is logged ont site [B] via the Internet, <br>
interleaved data packets can be inserted into the datastream by site [C] <br>
and Windows95 can be istructed to send [A]'s entire file directory <br>
structure back to [C], fully transparently, and all unbeknownst to [A].<br>
<p>
[A]'s files can be scanned via Boolean keyword searches, and business <br>
plans, spreadsheets, databases, correspondence, financial records etc. can <br>
be 'called up' by site [C].  Also, latent viruses in Windows95 can be <br>
activated for 'Information Warfare' purposes.<br>

<p>
[II] Inter alia, the Criminal Intelligence Division at New Scotland Yard, <br>
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington DC and the Office of <br>
George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence  (DCI) are <br>
investigating matters described in the Chronology of Events available on:<br>

<p>
[III] I am Amicus Curiae to the King County Superior Court in Seattle, <br>
Washington, in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau, who is being <br>
maliciously harrassed by the 'authorities' there.  I am a paid-up member <br>
of the Northwest Coalition against Malicious Harrassment based in Seattle.<br>
<p>
    (I myself alas suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, in part <br>
from injuries sustained while fighting in the Cold War alongside both MI6 <br>
and CIA, and from suffering malicious harrassment).<br>
<p>
      My telephone is thus also a police and medical lifeline.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
   When I recently received a higher-than-usual telephone bill, along with <br>
a standard BT offer to pay by equal fixed installments on an averaged <br>
monthly basis, I promptly accepted BT's offer (on 28th August 1997).  BT's <br>
records confirm this.  I THEREFORE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH BT.  (I also have <br>
friends in the International Human Rights fellowships who have offered to <br>
help with expenses).  And friends in the Criminal Law office at BT HQ.  <br>
<i>&gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
   I was told by the BT Coventry office that this was fine, that they had <br>
accepted this, that my account would be transferred to quarterly billing, <br>
and that I would in due course be sent details of the monthly fixed <br>
payments required.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Instead, something rather nasty happened.<br>
<p>
    Something _suspiciously_ nasty.<br>
<p>
<p>
     A day or so later, I got up to find that the phone had been <br>
     'crippled.' Seven consecutive outgoing calls were blocked.  So I <br>
     tried 999: they connected me to British telecom's 'Debt limitation <br>
     Office' in Dundee, who told me that they had 'superior powers' over <br>
     all other departments of bT, and that they would not reconnect the <br>
     service until I had paid 775 UKP in advance. Further, they threatened <br>
     to disconnect the service entirely if I did not comply with their <br>
     (unlawful) demands.  BT then _did just that__ while sending me four <br>
     different letters from four different people giving four different <br>
     rationales.<br>
<p>
     Just the sort of stunt the Czech secret police used to pull...<br>
<p>
<p>
     Accordingly I have filed a criminal complaint under the provisions of <br>
     the Criminal Justice Act which outlaw such harrassment with Leicester <br>
     police in respect of BT's Mr. Uttley.  An Investigation Number has <br>
     been formally issued by the police there.<br>
<p>
     I have applied to Dundee Police similarly, WRT Ms. Macrae and Mr. <br>
     McKay's behaviour at the 'DLO.'<br>
<p>
     I notified BT's 'Debt Limitation Office' that I counterclaim 50 000 <br>
     UKP WRT damage to my health arising from BT's unlawful behaviour.<br>
<p>
     I offered to pay a basic BT rental (for continuity of incoming calls <br>
     and emergency calls) while the dispute as to amounts claimed and <br>
     payment rates is resolved by Court Arbitration, which procedure is <br>
     _compulsory_ for BT.<br>
<p>
     I have offered to consider the following proposed settlement from BT:<br>
<p>
     BT to offer a full written apology directly from Vallance, and to <br>
     write off its present claim.<br>
<p>
     BT to offer a free ISDN service for an initial one year period<br>
<p>
     BT to offer a NOKIA 9000 from Orange, and one year's ORANGE service.<br>
<p>
     BT to offer 5 000 UKP io settlement of my outstanding claims against BT.<br>
<p>

<p>
                HOW TO RESOLVE THE LARGER 'BT PROBLEM'?<br>
<p>
   Much of BT's network was built via capital levies on subscribers' phone <br>
   bills.  Clearly, when BT was 'denationalized', this should have been <br>
   done simply (and without megabucks in 'sweeteners' and 'fees') by <br>
   mailing out equal shareholdings in BT to every elector on Monday <br>
   morning<br>
<p>
   BT staff seem to _hate_ BT -- most people do too, after all.  Who can <br>
   forget the cartoon of a man making a call from a phone box, while Busby <br>
   (remember him?  &gt;:-} ) leaned out of the 'returned' slot and <br>
   surreptitiously picked the punter's pocket...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
                     NOW, IMAGINE THIS FUNNY SCENARIO:<br>
<p>
      [A] BT staff start to 'work to rule' and make innocent mistakes...  <br>
      Such things do happen... They all hate the bloody company, anyway...<br>
<p>
      [B] The BT Network declines. BT will never get into America now: <br>
      whoever would possibly want to import an MI5 spy network?  &gt;:-}<br>
      All of BT's competitors go all-out for new business.<br>
<p>
      [C] Job opportunities boom with BT's rivals, creaming off all the <br>
      more 'mobile' and/or competent BT staffers.<br>
<p>
      [D] Rumours spread like wildfire that BT is on the skids...<br>
<p>
      [E] The great offshore Hedge Funds (like George Soros' Quantum Fund <br>
      -- remember Black Wednesday? ERM?  The Tories? ) smell 'blood in the <br>
      water', and start running relentless bear raids against BT stocks <br>
      and shares round the clock.  BT shares decline more or less gracefully.<br>
<p>
      [F] Meanwhile President Clinton has issued Executive orders tasking:<br>
<p>
      the Central Intelligence Agency<br>
<p>
                  http;//www.odci/cia<br>
<p>
      and the National Security Agency<br>
      <br>
                  <a href="http://www.nsa.gov:8080">http://www.nsa.gov:8080</a><br>
<p>
      Top flight outfit, NSA -- US$ 30,000,000,000 budget, 100 000 <br>
      brilliant,dedicated and playful staffers, worldwide SIGINT and <br>
      Electronic Warfare capabilities, you know...  Now tasked to gather <br>
      commercial and poplitical intelligence which can be useful to <br>
      American companies.  America has lots of fiercely competitive telcos <br>
      (Actually, anyone with NSA's resources could bring down BT's entire <br>
      network in around five minutes...).<br>
<p>
      A former CinCPAC and DIRNSA (Director, NSA) is a friend of mine...<br>
<p>
      [G]  BT slides inexorably into receivership.  In the reconstruction, <br>
      the public finally receive the shares they should have received in <br>
      the first place, and the BT staff run BT as a co-op, replacing the <br>
      'senior management' and the board (Good Riddance!), and take on any <br>
      external management advisers necessary for the 'difficult bits.'<br>
<p>
      We-all then have our own phone company in our own hands, BT's <br>
      previous -- 'looter' -- shareholders see their shares zeroed, and <br>
      the good guys (all of us!) win!  We can then have free local calls, <br>
      with competing trunk services, and superfast 'blinking' datacomms <br>
      services over standard twisted-pair lines.<br>
<p>
      Ideal for 'Blackbird' MacroComputers!!!  Project details from:<br>
