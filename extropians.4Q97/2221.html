Much, much earlier.  Although, it will probably be using real nerve<br>
tissue instead of silicon.  Rats have already been cured of paralysis by a<br>
grafting procedure, and the "grafted" cells can be incited to grow by<br>
neural growth factors.  Neuro-chip interfaces are in the midst, though...<br>
a non-toxic two-way interface is now possible, and hopefully soon we'll<br>
know how to exploit such an interface, and have the surgical techniques to<br>
connect all the nerves correctly ( or just connect them haphazardly and<br>
let the brain rewire its somatosensory/motor cortices to accommodate...<br>
although this may not be feasible considering how difficult a time the<br>
brain has with rewiring after amputation, ie. "phantom limbs") ... this is<br>
where Anders elaborates on my mickey mouse understanding of <br>
neuroscience...<br>
