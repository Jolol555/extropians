What do you mean? Daedalus escaped quite handily, it was Icarus who died, and that<br>
was payback for Daedalus' earlier  transgressions. Daedalus killed his nephew (an<br>
apprentice more skilled than he) out of jealousy. That's why he was in Minos' palace<br>
to begin with (exile or something).<br>

These some to have some utopian connotations, which may or may not be a good thing.<br>

That depends on how closely you're reading the DOJ's press releases concerning Gates<br>
&lt;fnord&gt; and Microsoft &lt;fnord&gt;. :-)<br>
