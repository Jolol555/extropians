I think both Delmar England and John Clark have totally missed the point<br>
of the first part of Greg's post.  That, or they're refusing to follow<br>
his flexible use of "objective".  He acknowledged that there isn't some<br>
Platonic realm of Objective Morals, or anything on the level of the<br>
presumed laws of physics.  He also said that such a result is not very<br>
interesting.  Practically, most people do want to live; practically,<br>
most people do want to live in societies; practically, most people who<br>
live in societies do want those societies to work well; and so<br>
observationally most people should follow certain rules in their<br>
society.<br>
<p>
This isn't "objective" in the sense of physics, or "objective" in the<br>
sense of "Ayn Rand derived this from a tautology", but it is objective<br>
instead of subjective in the sense that if you want certain things which<br>
almost everyone does in fact want then you can't behave arbitrarily in<br>
all aspects of your life, unless you're far more powerful than them.<br>
<p>
There's nothing in the laws of physics which codes for life but<br>
practically, chemicals got stirred around; practically, one of them was<br>
self-replicating; observationally, life happened.<br>
<p>
} just practical matters to take into consideration consider if you want to <br>
} build a society that works in a certain way, I don't see why they deserve the <br>
} lofty  title "Objective Morality" any more than a table listing the amount of <br>
<p>
I don't think everyone thinks objective morality is such a lofty term.<br>
Objectively, if you want to live then you should look both ways when crossing<br>
a street.  Normally we leave off the if clause because nearly everyone<br>
does want to live, or at least they don't want to die by being hit by a<br>
random car.  And no one cares, except in esoteric philosophical<br>
discussions like this one.<br>
<p>
I'd like to note for the record that I used to side with Rich Artym,<br>
arch-subjectivist, until I realized this was all much ado about nothing.<br>
Rich and I were talking philosophical absolutes; Greg Burch was talking<br>
pragmatic engineering for nearly universal goals.<br>
<p>
} Yet another problem, if "Objective Morality" really is objective then there  <br>
} should be some evidence of it in the non human world but we see none. If you <br>
<p>
No, because morality only applies to beings which can (1) affect each<br>
other and (2) communicate with each other.  And then the form of<br>
morality depends on how they can affect each other.  Asteroids don't<br>
communicate and sheep can't hurt wolves much.<br>
<p>
Speaking of wolves, you're wrong.  We do see something like morality in<br>
the non-human world, and wolves among each other are the canonical <br>
example.<br>
<p>
There isn't an objective morality keeping a Power from using us as<br>
feedstock.  But if there are multiple Powers, and they hang around each<br>
other for a while, we can predict the range of their behaviors.  That's<br>
objective morality.<br>

Although its rudimentary ego could neither receive nor transmit thought,<br>
it knew that it was a fontema, that it must roll and roll and roll,<br>
endlessly, that by virtue of determined rolling its species would<br>
continue and would increase. -- one of those Lensmen books.<br>
