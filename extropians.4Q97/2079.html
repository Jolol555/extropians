<p>
Hm... This means that India and China have higher per capita incomes <br>
than most European nations, since that was true in the year 800 AD.<br>
<p>
Try again.<br>
<p>
There are certain SOCIAL and POLITICAL factors that dramatically <br>
affect growth rates.  These factors changed over a <br>
relatively short period in western Europe; and in the course of a <br>
couple hundred years western Europe went from the verge of extinction <br>
(pushed from the east by the Mongols, from the south by the Moslems, <br>
and bound on the north and west by cold salt water, and seriously <br>
ignorant of science and technology as compared to those foes), to <br>
being the definers of world power.<br>
<p>
In the process, the LEADERSHIP of western Europe LOST most of their <br>
power over western Europe.<br>
<p>
Other parts of the world did not make that change.  Some <br>
leaders actively resisted for fear of losing their power.  Others <br>
tried to achieve some interesting <br>
compromises (that in the case of China amount to <br>
"Behave like them, be imaginative, independent, and individualistic, <br>
and above all, do what you're told") that didn't work.<br>
<p>
But a newly industrializing nation grows faster than an <br>
already-industrialized nation.  If the newly industrializing nation <br>
is not DEVELOPING new technology, but merely COPYING it, as is now <br>
the case for most industrializing nations, the growth rate can be <br>
quite incredible.<br>
<p>
All that is necessary is to start copying those social and political <br>
factors.  Maybe not all of them are necessary.  Maybe they are.  <br>
Maybe they work better copied in one order than in another.  <br>
<p>
South <br>
Korea apparently has copied enough to handle the process of <br>
*becoming* an industrialized country, but not the state of *being* <br>
one, so they are a bit of a mess right now, but the people will work <br>
it out -- if they are permitted to try lots of different ways to do <br>
so, most of which won't do very well.  (Same way Edison invented the <br>
light bulb.)<br>
