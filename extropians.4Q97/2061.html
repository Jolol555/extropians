A big part of the book was devoted to saying science should be <br>
understandable by the layperson.  This is okay, but can be taken<br>
too far.  Lerner's paean to Faraday is a welcome alternative to the<br>
modern heavily technical and seemingly nonsensical science,<br>
BUT it begs the question.  If science is about finding the truth,<br>
then the truth might NOT be as intuitive or as convenient as some<br>
would like it to be.  Does this make it any less true?<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Lerner questions quantum mechanics if I recall correctly?....or at least </i><br>

<p>
I don't recall all of it, though I seem to remember him coming down<br>
against the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) of quantum mechanics.<br>
(Correct me if I am wrong, but CI basically states that the traits of<br>
quantum systems are determined by the observer.)<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Lerner's explanation I COULD follow...and plasma filaments seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;plausible...as well as being experimentally verifiable I belelive?</i><br>
<p>
I believe so, but wonder how to distinguish between some of his<br>
plasma explanations and the more conventional ones.  We could<br>
(should?) adopt the method given by Paul Thagard in his <br>
_Conceptual Revolutions_.  It would be a learning experience.<br>
