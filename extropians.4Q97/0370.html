While Michio Kaku's latest release, "Visions: How Science with Revolutionize<br>
the Twenty-Fist Century" (as an aside, that title does not make much sense.<br>
How can you revolutionize something that has yet to occur?), contains a wealth<br>
of excellent material on near-future technologies, I was dismayed at the brief<br>
and unbalanced treatment Kaku gave nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
The most glaring omission from Kaku's discussion is the absence of Eric<br>
Drexler's name.  Dr. Drexler, along with other notable experts in the field,<br>
was deposited in the term nameless, faceless, credentialless term "advocates".<br>
In science circles, "advocacy" is not the most amicable term.  "Expert" is much<br>
more congenial.  Advocating (implying simply support for a concept and not<br>
necessarily knowledge) is different from knowing (i.e., being an expert),<br>
whether Kaku intended this subtle jab I do not know.  Kaku even failed to<br>
include any of Drexler's works in the "Recommended Reading" section of his<br>
book.  The only book dealing with nanotechnology that made it into this section<br>
was Regis' "Nano", not my first choice for an introduction to the subject.<br>
<p>
On the flip side, Kaku finds it necessary to identify and quote three different<br>
critics of nanotechnology: a chemist and columnist of "the prestigious Nature<br>
magazine" (none other than David Jones, the acidic critic of nanotechnology<br>
who, from his own comments on Drexler's "Nanosystems" either did not read the<br>
book at all or was severely confused when penning his comments on the book), an<br>
engineer from Hewlett-Packard, and an editor from a science fiction<br>
publication.  This constellation of critics that Kaku assembled is ironic in<br>
that Kaku opens his book criticizing how cogent discussion of technology<br>
(especially future technology) is inhibited by the media's reliance on<br>
nonscientists or nonexpert scientists.<br>
<p>
Nanotechnology is obviously a controversial subject.  True molecular<br>
nanotechnology (MNT), as described in Dr. Drexler's works, would have profound<br>
effects on virtually every aspect of our lives and literally transform<br>
humanity.  There are some legitimate scientifically-motivated (versus acrid<br>
criticism a la Jones) criticism of true MNT.  Smalley's comments regarding<br>
theoretical problems at the sub cubic nanometer are compelling and need to be<br>
addressed (check out <a href="http://cnst.rice.edu/NanoWelch.html">http://cnst.rice.edu/NanoWelch.html</a>).  I would have<br>
preferred that Kaku include Smalley and Drexler, experts in the area, in his<br>
nanotechnology discussion instead of the troupe he assembled.<br>
<p>
I am not a scientist by training, actually I am an accountant.  However, I was<br>
distressed at the unscientific treatment Kaku gave nanotechnology.  The last<br>
thing nanotechnology needs is to be regarded as pseudoscience.  Such a<br>
designation could make finding research funding difficult.  I am composing a<br>
letter to Kaku himself pertaining to the comments above.  If I receive a<br>
response from him I will, with his permission, post it to this mailing list.<br>
