<p>
Current thinking in linguistics is that grammar plays a fairly small role<br>
in ways of thinking; the Sapir-Whorf hyp. doesn't have much credibility<br>
anymore, except in a very weak version.  All languages can express any<br>
thought which can be produced in another language, give the technical or<br>
cultural understanding and vocabulary required.  Certain languages just<br>
code certain concepts more efficiently than others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Complete sentences in English have a subject, a verb, and (generally)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a predicate -- implied if not spoken.  Perhaps a language in which this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was not true would be difficult for us (I, strangely enough, can't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of one off the top of my head).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Several Asian languages use a "topic-comment" structure rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject-verb.  In Chinese, for example, "Fish: eat" is a perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt; valid sentence, but must be disambiguated by context (one does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; know whether the fish is the eater or the eaten without more info).</i><br>
<p>
We have topic-prominent sentences in English, too.  "Now, _fish_ I like!"<br>
"Fish you're feeding us?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't know of any there either.  Even in Lojban, one /must/ decide</i><br>
<i>&gt; ahead of time whether you're asking a question or making an assertion</i><br>
<i>&gt; or issuing a command.</i><br>
<p>
Some languages (especially creoles such as the various Caribbean<br>
languages, Swahili, und so weiter) rely entirely on intonation to indicate<br>
a question (ie, a question that doesn't require a wh- word); there is no<br>
change of word order.  All intonation languages allow this feature,<br>
including English.  "You have a new car."  "You have a new car?"<br>
I couldn't say how tone languages or pitch accent languages (like ancient<br>
Greek or Sanskrit or modern Swedish or Japanese) handle this.  Anders?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; That said, I think that English speakers are among the least constrained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on the planet, since we steal words from so many different languages.</i><br>
<p>
Loan word use is a cultural trait, not a linguistic one in itself;<br>
some use of loan words is inevitable when one language is in contact<br>
with a number of other languages, but loans as extensive as we find in<br>
English may represent a lack of linguistic chauvinism.  It is equally<br>
possible to get by entirely without loan words, using only neologisms from<br>
morphemes already found in the language in question.  I don't know offhand<br>
if total neologism-ism has ever happened; I think it would require a<br>
completely isolated, unified speech community.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And fine vowel distinctions.  That's one reason the French laugh at us:</i><br>
<i>&gt; no Amercian can say "En peu" with anything close to the right vowels.</i><br>
<p>
English has more vowel distinctions than most languages.  Some languages,<br>
such as the Caucasian languages (to which Georgian belongs) have only two<br>
vowels, schwa and /a/; most of the world's languages have 5 or 6, like<br>
Spanish.  English speakers who don't know French can't easily say "En peu"<br>
because we don't make phonemic use of nasalized vowels like French does,<br>
and we don't have any high rounded front vowels like in "peu."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And finally, there is the obvious thought-constraint of gender, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the parts of speech themselves: nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  Classical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chinese had no gender, but regrettably one of the "modernizations" it</i><br>
<i>&gt; suffered this century was to make it more European by using the male</i><br>
<i>&gt; words as generic pronouns, the female ones as female-specific, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; neutral ones fell out of use.  I don't know of any other natural language</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is gender-neutral.  Most artificial languages are.</i><br>
<p>
As in my other post, Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Turkish... but sexist<br>
language use reflects sexist meme-complexes; it is not encoded in minds by<br>
the structure of language.  If a culture is not sexist, it won't use one<br>
sex as the standard.<br>
<p>
As for parts of speech, _all_ languages have nouns, verbs, and anaphor.<br>
Other parts of speech are handled differently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One can learn more about the Lojban language, and order the recently</i><br>
<i>&gt; printed textbook, at &lt;<a href="http://xiron.pc.helsinki.fi/lojban/">http://xiron.pc.helsinki.fi/lojban/</a>&gt;.</i><br>
<p>
I'll have to take a look at this...<br>
<p>
BTW, does anyone else on this list have much in the way of a linguistics<br>
background?  General semantics seems fairly well known here (which I'll<br>
bring up again in a few weeks as I have some serious reservations about<br>
it), but as for academic linguistics...?<br>
