Secrecy breeds hostility. If you have something in the cellar and<br>
people don't know what it is, it is much easier to regard it as evil<br>
than if you do your work in public. Yes, there will be people who<br>
disagree with you, but there wont be a similar risk of the whole<br>
village showing up with torches. Openness is a good way of making<br>
others accept you and to get interested in your work.<br>
<p>
In a discussion on propaganda I participated in yesterday we decided<br>
that it is easiest to label something as evil in the minds of people<br>
if they know very little about it than if they know the thing<br>
reasonably well (fairly obvious). If you keep your work hidden and<br>
heavily defended, people will start to think you have a lot to hide<br>
and it will be very simple for the real luddites to convince them that<br>
you are doing disgusting things. On the other hand invite the<br>
neighbors to visit, they will be much less inclined to listen to<br>
propaganda. Exactly the same method works for fighting racism - it is<br>
hard to be a racist if you know foreign people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What we really need is to make people understand the new technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with an open mind. Just educating them about how they work has the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; surprising effect of just polarizing the opinion (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pro-genengineering camp becomes more pro, the anti-camp more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anti). This is very hard, but we need to do it or else we are going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; need your defenses even in our homes ("A transhuman! Kill the ugly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mutant!!").</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, any tips?</i><br>
<p>
One thing would be to set up educational websites with good and clear<br>
information anybody could access, preferably on several levels (from<br>
kindergarten to PhD level). Ideally these sites should be interactive<br>
so that people could ask questions and get good answers back.<br>
<p>
Another thing is to start discussing these technologies in public<br>
*now*, not wait until they suddenly bursts onto the scene and<br>
everybody gets moral panic. <br>
<p>
Do discuss transhuman technologies with friends, but do it in the<br>
right way. Instead of starting with immortality, total transformation<br>
of humanity and the wild effects of nanotechnology, which will only<br>
convince people that you are a sf freak, introduce ideas about dynamic<br>
optimism, cognitive tools to get smarter, how we can live longer using<br>
the right diets and the joy of controlling one's life instead of being<br>
controlled. These are ideas most people can readily accept, which<br>
doesn't contradict anything they think they know, are directly useful<br>
and also leads to more radical ideas in the long run. As a<br>
transhumanist friend of mine uses to say: "The war about the future<br>
will be settled in the coffee break discussions!".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Take a look at the controversies about pornography on the internet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the spread of illegal information and terrorism. I don't know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dutch media, but here in sweden the coverage have tended towards the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; very negative. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The net doesn't really seem hyped around here, in one way or another.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Holland is almost pornography heaven. Hardcore is for sale at most</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsstands and bookstores, and there are plenty of specialized porn</i><br>
<i>&gt; stores in most larger cities. Besides kiddieporn (under 16 years) just</i><br>
<i>&gt; about anything goes. There are even some excellent sex with animals mags</i><br>
<i>&gt; from...Sweden!</i><br>
<p>
It is probably a fairly different debate in different countries, and<br>
Holland is as far as I understand it fairly liberal in this<br>
respect. Not at al puritanical as Sweden! (Yes, the myth about the<br>
free swedish sexuality is just a myth; I suppose said sex is just<br>
exported :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Several politicians have proposed some rather draconian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; measures to prevent the spread of this nastiness, but have failed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; largely due to party politics. </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I know the politicians in holland are trying to get as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; people *on* the net as possible (don't know exactly why, maybe just</i><br>
<i>&gt; to look modern or something). They might regret this one day...</i><br>
<p>
They certainly will :-) Actually, it is a smart strategy to get people<br>
onto the net, since that may give the nation an educational edge. But<br>
here in Sweden the government was (and is) definitely trying to make<br>
sure the net only contains wholesome stuff. Of course, that project<br>
failed completely thanks to the fact that any proposal by the Moderate<br>
Party is automaticly sabotaged by the Social Democrats, and vice<br>
versa. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But I guess that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when people start to move to untaxable digital money, the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will see that as a direct attack.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But what can they do about it, and how would this affect transhumanism?</i><br>
<p>
Things could get rather messy. It is all a question of how fast things<br>
can chamge. If just a few people use the net for untaxable<br>
transactions, then it is a great excuse for the governments to hunt<br>
them down, scan the net and generally create a "war on tax fraud" -<br>
likely with great public support if they can make the media say that<br>
the only people using this are rich capitalists. On the other hand, if<br>
there exists economical software that everybody can use and it becomes<br>
widespread before the governments can stop it, then they will have a<br>
hard time doing anything.<br>
<p>
Transhumanism isn't really about how money should flow or not, but a<br>
sizeable number of transhumanists are extropians and hence laud this<br>
kind of development, and many of us really want to control our own<br>
money in the ways we want. So there would be a link to the<br>
transhumanist movement, that is sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, I'm working on a text for the local group for the proliferation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanistic ideas *right now* :-)</i><br>
<p>
Great! And I'm working on a tutorial for arguing for<br>
transhumanism. Good luck!<br>
