<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; of an electric car is three times as efficient as the internal power</i><br>
<i>&gt; cycle of a standard IC engine car, or 54% efficient.  However, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; also say that the internal power cycle of an electric car is only 45%</i><br>

<i>&gt; plant, transmission system, and battery charging system (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; equivalent) is rather in excess of 100%.</i><br>
<p>
No, what I am saying is that the energy drain to refine the oil that<br>
makes the gasoline, transports the gasoline, etc. further reduce the<br>
efficiency of an IC car, as a systemic calculation, while electric power<br>
plants are very efficient at creating the electricity from whatever<br>
source, that, in the end, according to what I saw a couple years ago<br>
from the Energy Dept, its a 3 to 1 difference. I don't remember the<br>
final, total system, efficiency percentages, just the ratio between<br>
them.<br>
