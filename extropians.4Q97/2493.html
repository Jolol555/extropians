<p>
Pardon me, but weapons _are_ instances of technology. In fact, many modern<br>
technologies are hi-tech weaponry spin-offs.<br>
<p>
Being human encompasses the entire spectrum, from the demon to the saint. <br>
One should think, as our skills grow, so will the scope of our<br>
possibilities. There is no proof that there will be no conflict. In fact,<br>
I think there will always be conflict in a darwinian theatre. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed </i><br>

<i>&gt; purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will listen.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we might need stronger argumentational devices than plain<br>
rhetorics. What will you do if anything you hold sacred is to be tread<br>
into the ground by the equivalent of thugs with guns? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't </i><br>
<i>&gt; explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we </i><br>
<i>&gt; working towards, anyway?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know. Even a postdoc in applied theology won't help here.<br>
