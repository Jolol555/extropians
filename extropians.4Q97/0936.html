It is very possible to form crystal lattices using a mixture of different<br>
elements, especially with metals.  In fact, some alloys (eutectics) exhibit<br>
the same phase behavior as pure metals.  Iron is generally an easily<br>
alloyed metal, probably due to the fact that it switches crystal structures<br>
(between BCC, FCC, and HCP) easily under fairly mild conditions.  As for<br>
amorphous crystals, I don't think metal crystals can be amorphous.  If I am<br>
not mistaken, amorphous crystals can only occur when there is little or no<br>
electron mobility in the lattice, which is not the case with metal crystals.<br>
<p>
Additionally, high temperature/pressure environments are *ideal* for large<br>
crystal growth.  The high temperature means the atoms have enough energy to<br>
organize, and the high pressure strongly encourages the formation of large<br>
crystal lattices.  When you consider that the core pressure is around 50<br>
million psi, it would be nearly impossible for amorphous crystal structures<br>
to occur, especially when you have the atomic mobility that occurs at a<br>
temperature of 5000-6000 C.<br>
