I would be interested in seeing various Extropian surveys polling the<br>
members of this list.  It would be best if this was done via e-mail or<br>
on a web-page so we don't have to read through all the responses.<br>
<p>
The latest gun discussion brings up the question of whether Extropians<br>
are more likely to own guns.  Extropians are discussing the Wired poll<br>
and trying to decide if we are "connected" enough.  People sometimes<br>
wonder what computers Extropians use, how much money we make, what kind<br>
of jobs we have, what services we offer, etc.<br>
<p>
Maybe this could be another Extropian service on the ExI page, polls<br>
showing extropian responses by percentage.  Maybe only paid members<br>
could actually vote, but anybody could read the results.<br>
<p>
Aside, wasn't/isn't there an idea exchange where people voted/invested<br>
e-cash on ideas or predictions?  I have lost track of that.<br>
