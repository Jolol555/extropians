Basically because the information is transmitted in the form of a <br>
photon, which can't travel faster than light. In the original IBM<br>
proposal you took two correlated photons, put them in boxes, and <br>
carried them to the source and destination of the transfer. At the <br>
source threw in the particle you wanted to transfer, measured the <br>
resulting state, sent that by radio, email, or carrier pigeon, then <br>
cooerced the other particle and photon into the appropriate state. <br>
Since the two photons were correlated, the second particle was then <br>
in the same state as the first.<br>
<p>
(I've forgotten some details, but this is the basic idea).<br>
