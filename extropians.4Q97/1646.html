 Has anyone suggested the name "Daedalus"?<br>
<p>
I've always thought it was an intriguing name to begin with, but in terms of<br>
transhumanism, it has some significance. As most schoolkids are familar with,<br>
Daedalus was the mythic Greek scientist who, while imprisoned by King Minos on<br>
Crete, fashioned wings of wood and wax for himself and his young son to escape<br>
to freedom. The parallels with transhuman technology are pretty clear, but the<br>
story also reminds us that it is possible to become intoxicated by our<br>
technological freedom, and behave irresponsibly (the story of Icarus).  This<br>
seems to blend nicely the desire to free ourselves from normal existence and<br>
the need to keep ourselves accountable to ourselves.<br>
<p>
Plus it's Greek.<br>
Plus it's clear to the public.<br>
Plus it's easy to remember.<br>
It has no "ex-" anywhere in it.<br>
And it's stood the test of time thus far.<br>
<p>
Only problem is, it's so recognizable, that I bet somebody's used it already.<br>
But hey, better an enemy outside the fold than within....<br>
<p>
Good luck,<br>
<p>
