I agree.<br>

I don't agree. If we could simulate brains, the most complex object in the <br>
known universe, then I don't think other objects would be an insuperable <br>
problem, nor do I think volume is necessarily proportional to simulation <br>
difficulty. We wouldn't have to simulate an environment exactly as it was on <br>
any given day on Earth, we'd only need to make it logical and complex enough <br>
to be interesting. <br>
<p>
Take the weather for example, even today we have pretty good models of it, <br>
we can't make a good prediction about what it will do a month from now and I <br>
doubt we ever will, but that's because of our ignorance of initial conditions <br>
and the weather's exquisite sensitivity to it. If you gave a meteorologist a<br>
description of the atmosphere for the next month based on a good computer <br>
model and a description of what the atmosphere actually did the two would be <br>
very different, but unless he had access to external instruments he couldn't <br>
tell which one was real and which one was the computer model. The model <br>
provided a completely logical, complex, and realistic description of what the <br>
atmosphere might have done, it's just that instead it did something else that <br>
was also logical and complex.<br>
<p>
Another thought, perhaps we could give our virtual creatures an advantage <br>
nature figured out how to give real ones, instead of relying exclusively on <br>
Darwin's style of Evolution with its horrible random mutation and natural <br>
selection, perhaps we could also have Lamarckian style Evolution by the <br>
inheritance of acquired characteristics. It would be wonderful if that the<br>
muscular body you worked so hard to develop, would make your children strong <br>
too. How splendid it would be if your offspring were born knowing everything <br>
you struggled to learn during your life. Unfortunately it doesn't work that <br>
way in our world, Shakespeare's daughter had to start from square one and <br>
learn how to hold a pen and make sense from squiggles written on paper, <br>
Einstein's son had to reinvent the wheel and rediscover that 2 +2 = 4. <br>
Besides being less cruel, Lamarck's type of evolution would be much faster <br>
than Darwinian evolution, that's why social evolution is so much swifter than <br>
biological evolution.<br>
