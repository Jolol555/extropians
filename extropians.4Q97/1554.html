E X T R O P Y   O N L I N E : BOOK REVIEWS<br>
<p>
We're getting close to being ready to open Extropy Online to take over from<br>
the print edition. While we're getting articles ready, I'd like to invite<br>
subscribers to the Extropians email list to review books of interest to<br>
Extropians. Below is a list of books I'd especially like to see reviewed.<br>
But don't hesitate to suggest others.<br>
<p>
Reviews may be anything from a brief notice of a couple of hundred words,<br>
to a detailed analytical review of 2,000-3,000 words.<br>
<p>
If you want to review one of these books but don't have a copy, we can<br>
either lend you a copy or buy one for you.<br>
<p>
REVIEWS OF THESE BOOKS WANTED:<br>
