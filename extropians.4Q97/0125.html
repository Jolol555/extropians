Dan replied with a compact summary.  Thanks, Dan.<br>
<p>

<p>
Yeah, Amazon.com will only handle overseas books if there's a US<br>
distributor, which my Oz publisher, Reed Books, don't have at the moment.<br>
However they've just been bought out, and are said to have a gung-ho team<br>
in London selling rights hard around the world.  Maybe it will work for THE<br>
SPIKE as well.<br>
<p>
Alas, up to now my publisher has been meeting resistance in the States<br>
among those she's trying to sell US rights to.  Cornell University Press<br>
showed an interest, which excited me for its prestige but alarmed me more<br>
by its probable low print run and tone of lofty inaccessibility.  In the<br>
event they scurried off, realising that the book was too non-academic for<br>
their line.  Simon &amp; Schuster also just knocked it back, on grounds that<br>
one might find some general transhuman encouragement in - apparently they<br>
have a similar book, or a book on a similar topic, due to come out soon.<br>
The more the merrier - but I hope mine can be among them in the Big<br>
Marketplace that is the USA.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I really like the book.</i><br>
<p>
I was hoping you'd say that...  :)  Thanks, Dan.<br>
<p>
BTW, I don't have my own web page, but there's some biographical and<br>
bibliographical stuff at the Ozlit site - toggle the URL in my sig, below.<br>
The links there to interview/article stuff on/by me in the Mensa magazine<br>
might be of interest.  And sadly I'm not a professor - just a research<br>
associate at Melbourne University.  They pay for the email and xeroxing, I<br>
give them useful publication points.  Barter economy lives!<br>
