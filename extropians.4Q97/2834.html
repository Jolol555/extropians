If guns somehow cause people to become murderers, what about Switzerland?<br>
What is the Swiss gun homicide rate compared with the US one?<br>
<p>
Also, for those making such comparisons, I read a few years ago that Britain's<br>
murder rate by guns (or anything) has always been very low, even before the<br>
current strict gun control regime was in place.  Ergo, this might be a cultural<br>
thing.  In other words, Britains are merely less violent than Americans.<br>
