<p>
      This discussion would be a __lot_ easier and more fruitful if you'd <br>
      take the trouble to read the Colloquium, "Criticism and the Growth <br>
      of Knowledge", Lakatos and Musgrave, eds. [1976].<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because observation is not important to your theory there is no way to </i><br>
<i>&gt; disprove it, so it's not science.              </i><br>
<p>
  &lt;Sigh&gt;.  You completely miss the point.  Science is _difficult_.  There <br>
  are _unsolved problems_.  If we find anomalies, we should work hard to <br>
  explain them within the Scientific Research Programmes, or explore the <br>
  problem-situation to discover previously unknown forces, quantities etc. <br>
<p>
  So the question I seek to answer is:<br>
<p>
  "What is it, out there, that is causing the redshift?",  NOT:<br>
<p>
  "Gimme a new theory, I can't solve the problem with the one I've got..."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Galilean or even Newtonian physics is wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Name six 'experiments' -- I dare you!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) The 2 slit interference experiment.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  Popper explains this neatly with propensities.  Propensities are real <br>
  properties, albeit a little like 'hidden variables.'  A dice has a <br>
  propensity of one in six to come up 6.  The _physics_ of dice throws is <br>
  very complex.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Heat up an iron bar, it glows with a blackbody spectrum, the electrons do    </i><br>
<i>&gt;    not spiral into the nucleus.</i><br>
<p>
     Electrons only 'spiral into the nucleus' in aether theory.  In <br>
     Relational Mechanics, they're held in various orbits of near-constant <br>
     radius by electric force, and the requirement for their sinewave <br>
     circular tracks to be non-precessional -- self-equilibrating to <br>
     integer frequencies, that is. Photons alter the electron masses and <br>
     characteristics, necessitating shifts to different orbits.  It's <br>
     beautifully simple, and extraordinarily powerful -- especially for <br>
     nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
     Bohr's [1913] model of the hydrogen atom is very nearly a classical <br>
     mechanical explanation, albeit with ad-hoc postulates.  <br>
     Unsurprisingly, since Bohr and Einstein both originally sought to <br>
     extend classical mechanics into the microworld.  As I do now.  I <br>
     provide physical explanations insted of ad hoc hypotheses.  This, we <br>
     call a 'progressive problemshift.' &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 3) The quantum well LASER in your CD player.</i><br>
<p>
  Relational Mechanics handles lasing easily.  It's a quantized phenomenon <br>
  - (RM includes the ballistic -- quantized -- theory of light). What's <br>
  your problem?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) The Michelson Morley experiment.</i><br>
<p>
  The Michelson-Morley experiment perfectly corroborates the ballistic <br>
  theory of light.  Doesn't everyone know this?  I'll bet the bank on it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5) Gravitational redshift.</i><br>
<p>
  Sheesh!!!  Gravitational redshift is perfectly predicted by the <br>
  ballistic theory of light.  Go look up 'Ballistics.'<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 6) The detection of gravity waves by Taylor and Hulse for which they won the   </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Nobel Prize in 1995.</i><br>
<p>
  But this is an _emprirical_ matter on which Relational Mechanics takes <br>
  no position -- it doesn't have to.  You just factor in the velocity of <br>
  propagation of gravity, electromagnetism etc.  Ideally, I'm looking for <br>
  non-linear equations of force interactions, instead of Waldemar Voight's <br>
  linear algebraic Doppler stuff, purloined (without any acknowledgement) <br>
  by Lorentz and Einstein.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just curious but is there anything special about the number 6?</i><br>
<p>
  Good question...  Remember, you did ask...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
  'The Prisoner' TV series -- Number Six?  <br>
<p>
  "SIX: Symbolic of ambivalence and equilibrium, six comprises the union <br>
  of two triangles (of fire and water) and hence signifies the human soul. <br>
  The Greeks regarded it as a symbol of the hermaphrodite.  It corresponds <br>
  to the six Directions of Space (two for each dimension), and to the <br>
  cessation of movement (since the Creation took six days). Hence it is <br>
  associated with trial and effort.  It has also been shown to relate to <br>
  virginity, and to the scales."<br>
<p>
  and:<br>
<p>
  "SIX is, like two, a particularly ambiguous number:  it is expressive of <br>
  dualism ( 2 x 3 or 3 x 2 ).  However, it is like four in that it has a <br>
  normative value as opposed to the liberating tendencies of five and the <br>
  mystic (or conflictin) character of seven."<br>
<p>
  or:<br>
<p>
  The Sixth Enigma of the Tarot is The Lover, symbolizing enmeshment, <br>
  union, antagonism, equilibrium, combination...<br>
<p>
  Then, there's the Zodiac...  Libra, equilibrium?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
  --  J.E. Cirlot, "A Dictionary of Symbols", RKP, [1971].<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21</i><br>
<p>
   The point you insist on ignoring is that the velocity of propagation of <br>
   gravitational force (if any) is not a feature of Classical or <br>
   Relational Mechanics.  In Newton's theory, gravity acts instantaneously <br>
   at a distance (even though he also says that it doesn't, because that <br>
   would have been 'occult' and could have gotten him executed).  Stop <br>
   conflating incompatible propositions, fer Chrissake!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If I assert that -- in a gravitational field -- the frequency of a         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;quartz clock slows, due to gravitational force modifying the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;structure of the  quartz molecules and the electron orbits, that's         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;not the same as saying 'time itself slows down.'        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why not? I say time is what a clock measures, you say time is ... that is to </i><br>
<i>&gt; say, according to your theory time is ..., ah,  ... sorry, I'm stumped.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;You say 'time slows':  I say the clock slows.       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this thing you call "time" is not a measure of how particles of matter and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; energy interact, such as the particles in my clock my body my brain or my  </i><br>
<i>&gt; world, then why should I be the slightest bit interest in it? </i><br>
<p>
  Sheesh!!! Time is a _dimension_.  You never studied Dimensional Analysis?<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; You think the logical positivists were foolish because they refuse to say  </i><br>
<i>&gt; things, like atoms, exist because they couldn't directly see them. I think  </i><br>
<i>&gt; your criticism is valid, but then you do something just as bad, you refuse to </i><br>
<i>&gt; say a thing, like time dilation, exists even though you can directly see it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me hear your own ideas about this, please don't tell me to read yet  </i><br>
<i>&gt; another philosopher's book.      </i><br>
<p>
      Again, you miss the point.  I'm asserting that there are alternative <br>
      explanations, one of which -- 'time dilation' is positivistic.  I <br>
      don't buy into positivistic stuff -- it's all obsolete.<br>
<p>
       <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The 'cosmic soup' scatters the starlight, and gravitational         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;accretion reconstitutes the photons back  into stars again.        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What the hell?!     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;It's a true 'steady-state' system.  Perpetuum Mobile -- there's 'no         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;way out of the system.'  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds dreadful. I thought a static universe gave you the creeps.</i><br>
<p>
      Einstein's four-dimenional Parmenidean Block Universe idea sure <br>
      does.  Since when is a (more or less) steady-state 'Perpetuum <br>
      Mobile' the same as 'static'?  Where do you log-in from?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;No 'entropic heat-death' in this, our Relational Mechanics Universe,       </i><br>
<i>&gt;       thank you!  Strike the Second Law of  Thermodynamics...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why would you want to strike the Second Law of Thermodynamics? All it says is </i><br>
<i>&gt; that entropy always increases, nothing pessimistic in that, it would  only be </i><br>
<i>&gt; so if the total amount of information was constant. We'd be in very  bad </i><br>
<i>&gt; shape if Entropy did not increase, that's the very definition of the heat </i><br>
<i>&gt; death of the Universe, but as long as entropy ALWAYS increases infinite life </i><br>
<i>&gt; is possible.</i><br>
<p>
      Because it's _incorrect_.  Continually recombine the (material, <br>
      massy) photons back into stars via gravity, and 'heat-death' just <br>
      doesn't ever happen.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; cars or the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.</i><br>
