<i>        &gt;I think Kristen is exactly right to suggest that there's no         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;difference between large private and large government scenarios.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think the difference is like day and night. It's true that if a private <br>
company kept getting bigger and more powerful and if the competition kept <br>
getting smaller and weaker then eventually it would be fair to call it a <br>
government. I can't point to the exact point where this transition occurs, <br>
but I can't point to the exact point where day fades into night either.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;With government there is no place else I can go if I don't like it,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;but I can always find a landlord  someplace who has rules I like </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;IAN: So long as you have enough money to pay all the rents and tolls         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in between you and him.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As soon as you ran out of money while looking for that good landlord,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you could quickly find yourself in debt slavery. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I wish it was not necessary to work for a living, but wishing does not make <br>
it so, no economic system can change that.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;in fact there is nothing stopping me from becoming a landlord         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;myself.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;IAN: The price of land is one thing that could stop you.   </i><br>
        <br>
Then I'll look for cheaper land, or work harder and make more money, <br>
or better yet, work smarter.          <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the only problems with gov't stem from the fact that it's so big </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The problem is it has no competition.  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Besides, land is not very important.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;IAN: It's as important as owning all of it means owning the basis of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;everything</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That sounds very 18'th century-ish, times change. As an Extropian you know <br>
that even the old cliche about land, "they're not making any more of it" is  <br>
not true. You should also note that the richest man in the world did not make <br>
his money from land but from information.            <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Saying land is not important and that gov't is a big problem is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;incompatable, because it's simply the claim to the ownership of so         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;much land that makes the gov't what it is.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's incompatible only to those who say the government's claim is valid and <br>
I'm not one of those.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;since the size of the land claim is the basis of the "evils" of         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;gov't.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Land claims is not the problem, in the USA there is lots of land in private  <br>
ownership that the government has never claimed ownership of. The problem is  <br>
that there is no area of wealth, value, or life they don't claim the right to  <br>
control and the fact that they usually have the muscle to back it up.<br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm just countering 100% anarchy. Minarchy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If it worked I wouldn't mind a small very limited government, but its been  <br>
tried and it doesn't work because it refuses to stay small and limited. <br>

<p>
Certainly, but what's wrong with that? At this moment you are trying to <br>
persuade me that your ideas are correct and you are acting ethically, if you<br>
put a gun to my head and told me to say  "Kristen Brennan is correct" then <br>
you would not be.         <br>

<i>        &gt;genocide against the Jews en masse without the Nazi military machine.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;But would a Nazi propoganda machine have been equally effective?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Lots of people may not like them, but how could they kill the Jews if there  <br>
was a large well paid army protecting them?<br>
<p>
A word about "propaganda", it would be wonderful if there was a infallible  <br>
way you could always tell truth from falsehood, but there is not. The best <br>
we can do is let everyone have his say and then fight it out in the free <br>
market place of ideas.<br>
