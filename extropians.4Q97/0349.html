Just some cheering news from the world of neuroscience:<br>
<p>
I got a preprint from Martin Ingvar about his experiments with<br>
ampakines (chemicals which enhance the activation of the glutaminergic<br>
AMPA channel). He and his co-workers did a double-blind study on<br>
their effect on healthy volunteers. It turned out that they improved<br>
visual associative memory, odor associative memory, acquisition of<br>
a visuospatial maze and memory for the location and identity of<br>
playing cards. The drug did not affect non-memory cognition such<br>
as alertness, motor performance and visual recognition. <br>
<p>
This is good news. First, it shows that there are cognition enhancing<br>
chemicals that work in healthy young people (there are far too few<br>
studies supporting this). Second, it suggests a whole new category<br>
of nootropic compounds. Third, while the improvements of memory were<br>
not that dramatic (10-20% on most tests) they are likely to be much<br>
better for older people or people with memory problems. Fourth, the<br>
results gives us new insights into how memory works, which will be<br>
important for further development. <br>
<p>
So, no genius-pills on the horizon, but yet another useful tool<br>
for tuning up the brain. <br>
