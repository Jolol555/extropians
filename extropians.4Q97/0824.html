In a message dated 97-10-26 23:46:01 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; Danny, Danny, Danny, think first. The earth is cooler now than it was<br>
  billions of years ago, right? Its no longer molten all the way through?<br>
  So due to contraction of cooling it should be smaller, right? NOT<br>
  bigger. &gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
 Well, the crust is only a few miles thick, and the propogation of matter<br>
from<br>
 the core to mantle is part of the cooling process.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;I also thought I had explained to you that the fact that the</i><br>
<i> &gt;existing contintents being only so much area means absolutely nothing</i><br>
<i> &gt;with regards to the size of the earth</i><br>
 <br>
 actually its how the continents fit, so its not about area, but about how<br>
 they are shaped, and by seeing how they fit, the only way they can fit<br>
 perfectly is if the earth was smaller than it is now, 80% smaller.  So no<br>
the<br>
 land doesnt affect the expansion of the earth necessarily, but it shows that<br>
 it exists.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;as well as that there is no way</i><br>
<i> &gt;the earth could expand due to material from the core moving out.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Material flows in and out all the time, and the density is merely due to</i><br>
<i> &gt;the gravitationally induced pressure of the weight of all the mass in</i><br>
<i> &gt;the outer layers pushing in. By your logic, the earth should be smaller</i><br>
<i> &gt;since the outer layers have been pushing against the core for billions</i><br>
<i> &gt;of years, so they must have compacted it down more. (Y'know, like why</i><br>
<i> &gt;your cereal settles down in the box over time)</i><br>
 <br>
 This is your opinion, you dont know how the inner core/mantle relationship<br>
 works.  Havent you ever heard of an expanding sun?  Things expand when they<br>
 cool.  Anyway, this is just a theory to back up the fact that the earth was<br>
 smaller a long time ago.  So, doesnt it seem obvious that the core is<br>
 expanding into the mantle?  The core is 3 times denser than the mantle.  You<br>
 say that the mantle flows in and out of the core, which of course you dont<br>
 know for sure, but if this is true, at the same time couldnt less and less<br>
 mantle be flowing back into the core?  Think yourself!<br>
 <br>

<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Also, the reason for lava coming up through volcanoes and the midatlantic<br>
etc.. is possibly because of the constant slight pressure of the earth<br>
expanding, makes sense doesnt it?  I just thought of that possibility, maybe<br>
I should make a paper on it and get famous (actually im sure people have<br>
thought of that before).  Mike I think you just like opposing everything I<br>
say no matter what it is, "the earth expands", ....."no it doesnt it<br>
shrinks", but I guess the scientific evidence gives us the truth though<br>
doesnt it?<br>
