The Fifth International Conference on Anti-Aging Medicine and BioMedical<br>
Technology (A4M - American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine) held this past<br>
weekend in Las Vegas.  <br>
<p>
I'd like to recap the "Brain Transplant Technologies" talk given by Robert<br>
J. White, M.D., Ph.D. (Professor of Neurosurgery, Case Western Reserve<br>
University).<br>
<p>
"While undoubtedly highly controversial, recent anatomical dissections and<br>
review of the experience of transplanting the animal brain at a subhuman<br>
primate level strongly suggests that the surgical procedure and support<br>
system could be successfully adapted at a human level for brain<br>
transplantation.  Experiments conducted from the 1960's through the 1990's<br>
demonstrated conclusively that the monkey brain contained within the head<br>
could be viably transferred to the body of a similar animal from which the<br>
head had been removed.  The techniques developed within the framework of the<br>
animal operative methodology would be fully adaptable for similar human<br>
surgeries requiring stages vascular association:  arterial and venous....<br>
<p>
"Two operative problems, which were solved in the experimental animal, would<br>
also have to be addressed in [hu]man....<br>
<p>
"The proposed operative gantries, and the physiological maintenance for the<br>
first human brain transplantation will be presented."<br>
<p>
Dr. White was an approachable speaker whose articulation and claim made his<br>
ideas seem not only tolerable by conventional thinkers, but also a rational<br>
approach to prolonging life and also possible applications for neurosuspensions.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately the conference was designed so that the speakers were summoned<br>
to give their talks one after another in rapid succession without audience<br>
participation.  They did, however, allot a very small area to meet with each<br>
speaker after her or his talk on the side-lines.  It was here that the<br>
enthusiasm and passion for brain transplant surgery was explored openly<br>
amongst about fifteen people.  Dr. White seemed a bit exhausted at his<br>
profession's negation of brain transplant surgery and present problems of<br>
connecting the spinal column to the brain stem.  In both the primate model<br>
and the human model, the spinal cord cannot be reconstituted at this time.<br>
One doctor volunteered that he has the money and the capability to perform a<br>
brain transplant with a subject, and exclaimed that he would do this<br>
for/with Christopher Reeves.  Dr. White explained, that because of the<br>
nonreconstitution of the spinal column, the brain transplant surgery would<br>
be a same-same physical situation unless Reeves' (for example) body was<br>
deteriorating rapidly -- essentially dying, the brain transplant could be<br>
then put into another body but it would still be paralyzed due to the spinal<br>
nonreconstitution.<br>
