Yes, really!:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I was rather impressed by Layzer's popularisation COSMOGENESIS, </i><br>

I was impressed too, though I feel he should have stuck to cosmology<br>
and physics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;`Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is a vast amount of genuine,</i><br>

<p>
This irreducible randomness and directedness seems real, yet most<br>
cannot accept it and try to explain them as an epiphenomena of our<br>
awareness.  Where, pray tell, did our awareness come up with them<br>
then!?!:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To fans of Big Science, Layzer offers one stunning challenge after </i><br>
<i>&gt;another.  The standard story of creation has a highly ordered fireball</i><br>
<i>&gt;Big Bang, inflating instantly to a smooth expanding cosmos - and can't </i><br>
<i>&gt;easily explain why galaxies clump into vast walls hugging cosmic </i><br>
<i>&gt;bubbles.  Layzer proposes a highly random cold origin, distinctly </i><br>
<i>&gt;unfashionable but intriguing.  </i><br>
<p>
But it seems to explain the large scale structure and mass distribution<br>
which extant Hot Big Bang theories has trouble have trouble accounting<br>
for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nothing daunted, he applies his theory to evolution - `beta genes', he</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggests, both provoke and edit mutations, spurring development - and </i><br>
<i>&gt;to the nature of language.  Ultimately, order emerges in hierarchies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-organisation, attributable in the final instance to the very expansion</i><br>
<i>&gt;of spacetime itself.</i><br>
<p>
Where he takes this is intriguing, but I feel it is a bit premature and<br>
might be attached to closely with his cosmological theory.  If his<br>
notions of self-organization prove wrong, then people might reject his<br>
Cold Big Bang -- even though it might be right.<br>
