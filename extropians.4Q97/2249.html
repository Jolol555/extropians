I didn't know much about this issue, but I've just browsed the web a bit<br>
to find some information about the ozone problem.<br>

Here is a page on "ozone myths" from the EPA:<br>
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/docs/ozone/science/myths.html">http://www.epa.gov/docs/ozone/science/myths.html</a><br>
<p>
Following the link about sources of chlorine, we find:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Myth: Volcanoes and the Oceans are Causing Ozone Depletion</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Volcanic eruptions are powerful events, and they are capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; injecting hydrogen chloride (HCl) high into the atmosphere.  Similarly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; oceans produce large volumes of sea salt, which contains chlorine, on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; daily basis. If these compounds accumulated in large quantities in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stratosphere, they might produce ozone depletion. However, for several</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons, we know that CFCs and other substances used in human activities</i><br>
<i>&gt; are the primary sources of chlorine in the stratosphere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, the vast majority of volcanic eruptions are too weak to reach</i><br>
<i>&gt; the stratosphere, around 10 km above the surface. Thus, any HCl emitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the eruption begins in the troposphere. Sea salt from the oceans is</i><br>
<i>&gt; also released very low in the atmosphere.  These compounds would have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; remain airborne for 2-5 years to be carried to the stratosphere. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; both sea salt and HCl are extremely soluble in water, as opposed to CFCs</i><br>
<i>&gt; which do not dissolve in water. Rain effectively scrubs the troposphere,</i><br>
<i>&gt; removing both of these forms of chlorine. Steam in volcanic plumes</i><br>
<i>&gt; can act the same way, removing HCl long before it reaches the ozone</i><br>
<i>&gt; layer. Measurements have shown that concentrations of these substances</i><br>
<i>&gt; vanish very rapidly as altitude increases.  Neither sea salt from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; oceans nor tropospheric-level volcanic eruptions (like Mt. Erebus</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Antarctica) contribute significantly to stratospheric chlorine</i><br>
<i>&gt; levels. Some sea life does produce methyl chloride, a more stable form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; chlorine than sea salt, but its contribution is small, as explained below.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; CFCs, on the other hand, do not dissolve in rain. In addition, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical processes have been found that aggressively remove them from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the troposphere. In fact, one of the advantages of the CFCs was their</i><br>
<i>&gt; stability. However, it is this very stability that poses a threat to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ozone layer.</i><br>

<p>
Reading the section on chlorine, we find:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1.1) Where does the Chlorine in the stratosphere come from?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ~80% from CFC's and related manmade organic chlorine compounds,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  such as carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ~15-20% from methyl chloride (CH3Cl), most of which is natural.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  A few % from inorganic sources, such as volcanic eruptions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  [Russell et al. 1996] [WMO 1991, 1994] [Solomon] [AASE]</i><br>
<i>&gt;  [Rowland 1989,1991] [Wayne]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These estimates are based upon &gt;20 years' worth of measurements of</i><br>
<i>&gt; organic and inorganic chlorine-containing compounds in the earth's</i><br>
<i>&gt; troposphere and stratosphere. Particularly informative is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; dependence of these compounds' concentrations on altitude and</i><br>
<i>&gt; their increase with time. The evidence is summarized in section 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this FAQ.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe things are different down in the Antarctic?  This seems to<br>
indicate otherwise:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4.2) CFCs are produced in the Northern Hemisphere, so how do they get down to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Antarctic?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Vertical transport into and within the stratosphere is slow.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes more than 5 years for a CFC molecule released at sea level to</i><br>
<i>&gt; rise high enough in the stratosphere to be photolyzed.  North-South</i><br>
<i>&gt; transport, in both troposphere and stratosphere, is faster - there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; a bottleneck in the tropics (it can take a year or two to get across</i><br>
<i>&gt; the equator) but there is still plenty of time.  CFC's are distributed </i><br>
<i>&gt; almost uniformly as a function of latitude, with a gradient of ~10%</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Northern to Southern Hemispheres.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Singh et al. 1979] [Elkins et al. 1993]</i><br>
<p>
I hope Warrl will respond to this.  On the face of it it appears that<br>
his (1) was technically correct but irrelevant (since he referred to the<br>
atmosphere rather than the stratosphere where depletion occurs), and his<br>
(2) is incorrect.  Likewise (3) is irrelevant since it does not refer<br>
to the stratosphere, and (4) appears to be contradicted.<br>
