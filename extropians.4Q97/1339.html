<i>&gt; Actually, I consider this "stuff of consciousness" to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, or more accurately instantiated information. So I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; no problem imagining a computer experiencing the color red if it has</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right software, and transferring my mind into the computer is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a problem of replicating the pattern. But I cannot be sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; until I try.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes "instantiated information" is more accurate.  Instantiated<br>
information is represented by something fundamentally real.  The state<br>
of a transistor can be an instantiation or representation of the word<br>
stop.  So can the color red.  A distinguishably different state of<br>
that same transistor can be an instantiation of the word go.  And<br>
green could similarly be taken to represent go.  But, there are some<br>
important qualities that red/green has that the particular states of<br>
the transistors do not have.  It doesn't matter what the fundamental<br>
state of the transistor is as long as it is interpreted correctly.  If<br>
you reverse the interpretation and the setting of the value the<br>
abstract meaning stays the same even though the fundamental or<br>
physical representation is now opposite.  If we swap the meaning of<br>
red and green, the abstract meaning can be the same, but the<br>
fundamental subjective or phenomenal experience is very different.<br>
Such phenomenal qualities of experience must be taken into account in<br>
order to reproduce consciousness.<br>
<p>
	Would you really be happy if all you knew of "salty" was<br>
whether or not some abstract salty bit was set or not and all you had<br>
was a corresponding look up table containing all the strings people<br>
had ever used to try to verbally describe what salty is like?  "It's<br>
kind of a puckery non sweet taste" just contains no meaning at all<br>
about what salty is really phenomenally like.  The difference is the<br>
actual fundamental and phenomenal nature of the particular<br>
"instantiation" and this difference is most definitely important to<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
	How many abstract bits of information would it take to store<br>
the various possible responses to the question: "What is salty?"  in a<br>
discussion kind of way?  Wouldn't an abstract machine producing such<br>
responses really be a liar since it really had no idea what salty was<br>
phenomenally like?<br>
<p>
	How many bits do you think the brain uses to reproduce such<br>
"information"?  Or does it simply know what salty is like?  And might<br>
such phenomenal abilities to "instantiate information" be one reason<br>
for such "common sense" intelligence that abstract machines still<br>
lack?<br>
<p>
	Wouldn't an honest and intelligent abstract machine be able to<br>
recognize that it doesn't really know what salty is like, just as you<br>
must admit that you don't know what salty is like for me, unless salty<br>
is the same for me as it is for you?<br>
<p>
	If you get a chance, you should ask Marvin Minsky what he<br>
thinks about this kind of stuff.  I believe he once thought very<br>
similar to the way you now think.<br>
