<i>&gt; I just sent out an article quoting numbers of murders by handguns in</i><br>
<i>&gt; various countries.  Just after sending it, I realized that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaningless, because there can still be plenty of murders without</i><br>
<i>&gt; handguns.  Perhaps the total murder rate, all weapons accounted for,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is similar in various countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, after a bit more web surfing, I came upon a chart showing</i><br>
<i>&gt; murder rate is the US broken down by weapon.  The web page is</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp">http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp</a> and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; chart shows that between 1971 and 1995, the percentage of murders</i><br>
<i>&gt; that occur with firearms fluctates between about 80% and 95%.  So,</i><br>
<i>&gt; my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate in the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt; between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed nations, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.</i><br>
<p>
That's one way of putting it.<br>
<p>
Another way of putting it: the US murder rate by KNIFE is higher than <br>
the English murder rate TOTAL.<br>
<p>
Eliminating guns is not likely to change this; for that matter, it <br>
strongly indicates that guns are simply the first-choice weapon, not <br>
the only-choice weapon.<br>
<p>
And this is known: guns are -- according to the FBI -- the LOGICAL <br>
first choice, the most effective choice, for crime VICTIMS.  Gun <br>
defense is more effective than knife defense.  More effective than <br>
struggle defense.  More effective than run-away defense.  More <br>
effective than non-resistance.<br>
<p>
So if you promote the elimination of guns, you are trying to defend <br>
criminals from their victims.<br>
