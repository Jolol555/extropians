In a message dated 97-12-19 12:42:50 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Fully automatic weapons<br>
 are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the military), and I suspect<br>
 the same is true for most of Western Europe.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The only way an american citizen can have a fully automatic weapon is to pay a<br>
special bribe to the BATF...theyre rather expensive and rare.<br>
<p>
&lt;So, as I said, since it is clear to me that there exist countries<br>
today that are substantially unarmed and also free and peaceful, it is<br>
unclear that Jefferson's statement will be proved correct in the long<br>
term.&gt;<br>
<p>
I guess we have a different definition of "freedom'...I've been to Canada a<br>
few times...Toronto as a matter of fact....It doesn't fit my definition of a<br>
free country..(soooooo many rules and regulations...and TAXES!!!!!!!) .and<br>
neither does Greece or Germany...the only european countries I've visited.<br>
<i>&gt;From what I've heard on this list neither England nor Holland are very free</i><br>
either...<br>
<p>
Does anyone know of a free country?  That is...one where the state does not<br>
steal over half your income...can take your property at will, or tell you how<br>
to use it arbitrarily...and has other powers over what you can and can not do<br>
(censorship, consensual sex, drug use, thinking dirty thoughts on a steamboat<br>
landing...like that)<br>
<p>
The first and foremost freedom a person has is the right to defend<br>
himself...today that's a rare commodity...many times you have more to fear<br>
from "authority" than criminals..  Which is my whole point....<br>
<p>
<p>
I think Jefferson was absolutely right..<br>
