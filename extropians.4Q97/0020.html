I don't understand how you can use "rather" here, since you<br>
can't have one of these things without the other.  If you're<br>
favoring one, then you're favoring the other.  Unless you think<br>
of the death of an individual conspecific as *not* being an<br>
injury to the species.  But I do think morality is far and away<br>
more a memetic phenomenon than a genetic one, although it's true<br>
that these two domains are messily intertwingled with one<br>
another.<br>
<p>
Genetic selection certainly happens at the individual level, not<br>
the species or gene level... it is not actual genes that get weeded<br>
out by natural selection, but individual zygotes, particular<br>
combinations of genes.  It's only the additive effect of natural<br>
selection upon us zygotes that results in modifications to the gene<br>
pool.  That's why biological evolution is so much slower than<br>
cultural evolution.<br>
<p>
At the memetic level, on the other hand, conscious selection can<br>
be as fine-grained as we like.  I can consciously decide that X is<br>
a bad idea, and discard it.  If I have trouble discarding it, then<br>
I can start making fun of it, and encouraging my friends to joke<br>
about it, and that often drives the demon out.<br>
