<i>&gt;Steve Witham quotes Bey:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                ...The extropian therefore lacks and needs a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    critique of technology,</i><br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis replies:<br>
<i>&gt;...Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;this statement reflects a need for Extropians to make more public</i><br>
<i>&gt;statements or publish writings that reflect our understanding of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;complexity....</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes, but also, just publicly "understanding this complexity" isn't<br>
the same as having a "critique," which means an organized and developing<br>
*critical* position and approach, as I understand it.<br>
<p>
I think a critique of tech is not something we extropians have a big<br>
concensus on, even compared to other issues.  So extropians<br>
in general may never be known for it.  It doesn't mean lots of us don't<br>
think smart thoughts about it or have our own personal critiques.<br>
(I know it's a main reason I'm an extropian.)<br>
Bey himself, in the bit I quoted, credits us with knowing some of the<br>
bad effects of tech.<br>
<p>
On the one hand I wish extropians were more interested in critique of<br>
tech; on the other, utlimately those who ain't, ain't.  In the same way I<br>
wish libertarians made more of a point of being critical of big<br>
corporations and mass-produced culture.  Many are, but it's not the image<br>
people have of libertarians.<br>
<p>
Also, I think critiquing tech is harder than most tech critics (including<br>
Bey) make out.<br>
<p>
So, I agree with Bey that we lack and need one (at least one), but it<br>
ain't easy to come by and it may not be on the top of most extropians'<br>
shopping lists.<br>
<p>
Dan Clemmensen writes-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If Bey feels that we pay inadequate attention to the possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;negative effects of technology (and especially future technology),</i><br>
<i>&gt;then what must he think of the attention given this subject by</i><br>
<i>&gt;most of the rest of society?</i><br>
<p>
Here's a clue: he devotes an essay to us, not the rest of society.<br>
This is is strange if you know his anti-tech, anti-"Capital" sentiments.<br>
Bey's criticism seems (to me) based on respect, at least formal<br>
respect, not just a dismissal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I strongly suspect that this group</i><br>
<i>&gt;pays a lot more attention to this subject than almost any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;group does, spcifically including the groups whose declared duty</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the guidance of society.</i><br>
<p>
Like I said, smart thinking isn't the same as having a critique.<br>
He is specifically challenging us<br>
to come up with a critique of tech.  What is the extropian critique<br>
of tech?  The critical thinking implied in "Dynamic Optimism?"  It<br>
would have to be more specific than that.<br>
