Hi peoples <br>
1 ) I was wondering about buckyballs as the material<br>
needed for a mega-engineering project like a beanstalk<br>
2 ) Is it possible to first put a series of<br>
geostationary spacestations/spacefactories that<br>
produce buckyballs and <br>
3) related materials/pre-fab/self-replicating<br>
processes ( maybe we can expand on this<br>
self-replication stuff, I see it as inevitable<br>
progress if we are to do beanstalks; dyson spheres<br>
and roaming intelligent asteriods with artifically<br>
engineered trees ... I think Dyson expounded on this<br>
as well !! ) <br>
4) With all the materials; manpower and resources in<br>
Space then we build down...right?!<br>
5) Is there other materials other than buckyballs<br>
which is just as good for the job ?! <br>
6) What about nano-technology producing a<br>
super-conductor that works at high temperatures, does<br>
this provide the energy supply infrastructure needed<br>
for mega-engineering ?<br>
7) So we really serious about this mega-engineering<br>
stuff ? ( I see it as the push its going to give to<br>
technology , of course if other factors like Doomsday<br>
and Tower of Babel occurrences can be filtered out of<br>
our history !? This push/leap in technology is what<br>
this extropian paradigm is all about ! )<br>
8) SO WE'RE GOING FOR IT ?!  ANYONE GOING TO SHOOT US<br>
DOWN ... WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET FUNDING FOR THIS<br>
MEGA-STUFF...( i know i'm cramping in a lot of stuff<br>
in here , i just want to put us in a 'constructive'<br>
direction )<br>
9) Great, thanks for your kind attention<br>
10) Great resources and web-pages, guys,<br>
out of this world,...!!!<br>
Rgds <br>

this for the strength?<br>
&lt;snip&gt; <br>
If you want a stronger structure, you either build it<br>
out of stronger material or, if you have no stronger<br>
material (available at an acceptable price), you build <br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
Also, what do you think of the "open"-structure.<br>
Is that still not wind-proof :-)<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
An open structure would probably help, because you<br>
can often get just as much strength with less<br>
material by arranging it in an open lattice (the<br>
Eiffel Tower is an example, as are geodesic domes).<br>
