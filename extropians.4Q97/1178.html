<i>&gt; Perhaps Brin's and my discomfort with cypherpunks is only that,</i><br>

<p>
I've thought a little bit about this (because at first I found it a <br>
really weird statement). I myself always was very 'open' with <br>
information about me, not really paying attention on who might read my <br>
eMail, for an instance.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, it turned out that the wrong people DID read SOME of my <br>
private mail, and got a completely wrong impression. Now I have to say <br>
that anybody who writes anything not adressed to a public (like in <br>
mailing-lists) unencrypted is simply naive. The problem is not that much <br>
revealing something about your personality, but people who only get parts <br>
of the information and misunderstand it - without you having control over <br>
that. The greatest 'threat' I see is simply being quoted out of context <br>
by people with prejudices - and not even getting the opportunity of <br>
straightening such things out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose I should also note that this group in particular is</i><br>
<i>&gt; very good at finding exceptions to my generalizations.  For</i><br>
<i>&gt; example, on the net in general, I find that a silly "handle" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually a quick way to sort out those who probably don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be taken seriously.  Indeed, I dicovered Extropy institute</i><br>
<i>&gt; before I started subscribing to the list, but dismissed it at</i><br>
<i>&gt; first because I had a hard time taking seriously anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; founded by guys using the names "Max More" and "Tom Morrow" (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; wherever he puts the zeros).</i><br>
<p>
Same thing here: 'quoting out of context'. You could say that by giving <br>
yourself such a name, you provoke misunderstandings - on the other hand, <br>
why not express certain ideas in your name? Simply put: if you miss <br>
something interesting by prejudice (people with 'freaky' names can't be <br>
taken seriously or the like), it's your own fault.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I've since discovered that those</i><br>
<i>&gt; handles have serious minds behind them, as do "The Low Golden</i><br>
<i>&gt; Willow", "Hara Ra", and others.  Outside this list, I continue</i><br>
<i>&gt; to save time by not reading anything with an name like that</i><br>
<i>&gt; attached to it, unless it is specifically referred to me, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; here on this list I can't use that filter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I'm sure the cypherpunks in this group don't fit the mold</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those I've met elsewhere, either.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe the problem is people identifying themselves with something like <br>
'cypherpunk'. This is, btw, one thing I'd criticise about Extropianism: <br>
in many places, you can read something like 'Extropians do this or that'. <br>
It may not be a problem for people who understand extropianism because I <br>
think it's quite explicitely about diversity and openness, but with any <br>
closed group, where people identify themselves with the group (with <br>
statements like "I'm a pothead", or "I'm a communist"), I've often seen <br>
how people hide their identity behind a group-name, which might explain <br>
why some of 'cypherpunks' are not really interesting (and I still would <br>
first listen to what such a person has to say)<br>
<p>
later,<br>
