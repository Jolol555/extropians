What more you could possibly demand of teleportation? <br>
The quantum state is all there is to say about an object, it's meaningless to <br>
say that the object was destroyed here an another one with the exact same <br>
quantum state created there, it's the same object.<br>
<p>
The only thing we know about Homer is that he was blind, lived in 800 BC and <br>
wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey it would be meaningless to say that those <br>
epic poems were not written by Homer but by another blind man in 800 BC who <br>
coincidentally just happened to have the same name, "Homer".<br>

<i>        &gt;in our head is almost certainly irrelevant to our consciousness. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
The exact quantum state of your brain is almost  certainly far more <br>
information than you'd need to duplicate consciousness, but it's definitely  <br>
not irrelevant.               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This is why people can put their heads into MRI scanners, and nobody         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;has ever come out of one as a vegetable, an axe murderer</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
An MRI scanner will change the quantum state of your brain and thus it will <br>
change you, so will reading this post or being bitten by a mosquito.<br>
