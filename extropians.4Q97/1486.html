     Mary LeTourneau, 35, a schoolteacher, has an affair with a 13-year-old <br>
     boy, a former student of hers.<br>
<p>
     The affair produces a guilty plea to charges of second-degree child <br>
     rape. It also produces a baby and, last week, a suspended sentence.<br>
<p>
     Mark Blilie, 42, a schoolteacher, has an affair with a 15-year-old girl, <br>
     a former student of his. <br>
<p>
     The affair produces a conviction for third-degree child rape and child <br>
     molestation and four years in the joint for Blilie.<br>
<p>
<p>
     What's wrong with this? <br>
<p>
<p>
     I mean, other than the fact that both these people did horrible things, <br>
     that they abused children and the hopes and trust of entire communities.<br>
<p>
     What's wrong, of course, is the similarity of the situations and the <br>
     vastly different outcomes. <br>
<p>
     How did this happen?<br>
<p>
     The answers are as simple as human history, and as complicated as the <br>
     human heart. <br>
<p>
     But here's a clue.<br>
<p>
     One newspaper account of LeTourneau's sentencing hearing contained this <br>
     passage:<br>
<p>
     "During the sentencing, the mother of the boy forgave LeTourneau, who <br>
     appeared in an aquamarine sweater, black pleated skirt and her hair <br>
     pinned up with soft tendrils." She has frequently been described in <br>
     other news accounts as blond and attractive.<br>
<p>
     In case you're wondering, the phrase "soft tendrils" did not appear in <br>
     any of the stories written about Mark Blilie. In fact, there was no <br>
     physical description of him whatsoever, although judging from a <br>
     photograph taken on the day of his sentencing, he is a tall, handsome, <br>
     dark-haired man. The eattle Times published that photograph with a <br>
     caption identifying him as "convicted child rapist Mark Blilie."<br>
<p>
     The caption published with the photograph of Mary LeTourneau taken at <br>
     her sentencing identified her as a "former teacher."<br>
<p>
     I'm not trying to suggest that Blilie should have evaded prison or that <br>
     LeTourneau should be sent there. I frankly don't know. But the <br>
     circumstances of the two cases are so strikingly similar that you would <br>
     think their sentences would be as well.<br>
<p>
     Often, in cases like these, the histories of the accused individuals <br>
     play a crucial role in sentencing. Neither Blilie nor LeTourneau had <br>
     previous criminal histories. <br>
<p>
     The chief difference is Blilie is a man, LeTourneau a woman.<br>
<p>
     A fast-developing area of biology is spooling out ingenious Darwinian <br>
     explanations of human sexual behavior: Men seek multiple sexual partners <br>
     to increase their chances of reproducing; women seek them to set up a <br>
     competition among sperm - may the best man win.<br>
<p>
     Sexual desire, the theorists say, is physical. It is as weird and <br>
     wonderful and perverse as the world. In some sense, we can't control the <br>
     desires we have. As a species we're hard-wired for reproduction. It's <br>
     what we live to do, seeking a sort of serial immortality. Our desires <br>
     encourage us.<br>
<p>
     I'd bet that 95 people out of a hundred would explain Mark Blilie's <br>
     actions as a result of nothing more than sexual desire, inadequately <br>
     constrained.<br>
<p>
     LeTourneau has contended throughout her ordeal that her only defense is <br>
     one from the heart.<br>
<p>
     The boy was old and wise beyond his years. His own mother calls him an <br>
     "old soul." LeTourneau says she fell in love with him, and although she <br>
     acknowledges what she did was wrong, she says she loves him still.<br>
<p>
     She says this does not excuse her actions, but might help explain them. <br>
     Actually, no, it doesn't help explain them. In fact, in some ways it <br>
     makes them even more confusing and disconcerting. <br>
<p>
     Love, unlike desire, is a human invention. It is almost entirely a <br>
     creation of culture and is in large part a product of intention.<br>
<p>
     In some sense, it would be easier to accept LeTourneau saying she got <br>
     carried away by rash and unfortunate desire. To say she loved the boy <br>
     is to say she wanted to happen what did. It further mystifies everyone <br>
     but her.<br>
<p>
     We can accept the fact that some people are just plain bad. When they <br>
     commit crimes, we understand that bad people do bad things.<br>
<p>
     But when good people do bad things and do them on purpose, we are left <br>
     without our normal, comforting rationalizations. It's very scary because <br>
     in the end we are left to wonder: <br>
<p>
     What about us?<br>
