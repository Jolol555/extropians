<i>&gt; Then even if you succeeded in your task all you would have done is provide</i><br>

<i>&gt; I said "an" objective definition not "the" objective definition.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, and that's why I specified "the" objective definition rather than<br>
"an" objective definition.  There are many objective definitions of reality,<br>
but only one of them is right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Does the existence of "objective cardinality" cause there to be more</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;of things?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. You're talking about "things" so I must assume you're talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; finite numbers because there is no proof there is an infinite number of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing. If two finite sets could be put into a one to one correspondence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet one set have more members than another then logic would not work in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternate universe and the phrase "more of things" becomes gibberish.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, explain this to me again.  You're saying that the existence of<br>
numbers causes there to be more objects?  Objective cardinality is a force<br>
pervading the Universe which causes all numbers to increase?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If you went to an alternate Universe where numbers did not exist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;how would things be the slightest bit different?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I couldn't go there because then there would have to be at least 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; universes and 2 does not exist, the only thing that does is the null set.</i><br>
<p>
By a similar token, you can't visit another Universe where External morality<br>
is absent, because this would be a logical fallacy - assuming that External<br>
morality exists here, that is.<br>
<p>
We now think (although we're not really sure) that Fermat's Last Theorem is<br>
true.  You can't say:  "But suppose we visited another Universe where FLT is<br>
false, how would things be the slightest bit different?"  Admittedly, FLT<br>
doesn't seem like a major underpinning of the laws of physics - but you can't<br>
negate FLT without blowing away the math that does describe/underpin the laws<br>
of physics.<br>
<p>
Before Andrew J. Wiles, we didn't know whether FLT was true, but we knew that<br>
if it was true you couldn't visit a Universe where it was false, and if it was<br>
false you couldn't visit a Universe where it was true - not without things<br>
being drastically different, at least.  I am making an analogous statement<br>
with respect to External morality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       +&gt;&gt;Alternate conversation:</i><br>
<i>&gt;       +&gt;&gt;Obviously "Objective Reality" isn't being defined as what causes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       +&gt;&gt;neural events that I experience as belief, but in some different way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   +&gt; Obviously, and for that very reason it's equally obvious to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   +&gt; whatever "Objective Reality" is defined to be it should have no interest</i><br>
<i>&gt;   +&gt; to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Quite correct, if you were to define "Objective Reality" in such a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the neural events in my brain were not part of it then I would have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in "Objective Reality".</i><br>
<p>
Nice bait-and-switch, but you should know better than to try changing<br>
definitions on me.  Just because "Objective Reality" isn't defined as what you<br>
believe, doesn't mean that what you believe isn't a *part*, a *subset* of<br>
Objective Reality.  So I repeat:  If I define Objective Reality so that your<br>
neurons don't define OR but are merely part of it, does this mean OR has no<br>
interest to you?  If I say that your goals don't define External morality but<br>
are merely a part of it, does this mean EM has no interest to you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Just because you can't think of something [Objective Morality]</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;doesn't mean it isn't there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's certainly true, but in the case of objective morality I don't even</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to try to look for it because I can't see any puzzle it could solve if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; found it. Again, that doesn't prove such puzzles are nonexistent but there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are plenty of very difficult problems that I already know for a fact to exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; and life is short.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that life is short; that's why Singularitarian Externalism holds that<br>
we should attempt to enhance intelligence instead of trying to solve EM - make<br>
do with interim solutions.<br>
<p>
If you can't see what puzzle we're trying to solve, it's because you refuse to<br>
acknowledge the possibility that the value of a goal is part of objective<br>
reality.  As long as you're willing to admit the possibility, then the puzzle<br>
is:  "Are the values of goals part of objective reality, and if so, what are they?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;My ethical imperatives are all interim solutions and are presented</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;as such.  Wouldn't the Universe be a much nicer place if everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;else did the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your ideas about what is ethical and what is not are similar to my own</i><br>
<i>&gt; (except for your belief that a crack neighborhood is as bad as the Holocaust),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and yes, I think that if most people behaved as we do then the Universe would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a much nicer place, but other people have a different opinions and may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; even want to live in a nicer place.</i><br>
<p>
I wish I knew which opinion was correct.<br>
