Regarding Bogus research...Noble Savages and suchlike someone wrote..<br>

Thanks for validating "something I'd read somewhere"...I'd also heard<br>
something similar.  However...I've a sister-in-law who is working toward a<br>
Master's in one of those touchy-feely "disiplines"...counceling of some<br>
sort....and she mentioned one day when I stopped by for a visit...that she was<br>
studying the works of Madame Mead in her coursework.  I causually mentioned<br>
that I'd heard that Madame Mead was a fraud....and then ran for my<br>
life...(figuratively...she wouldn't REALLY have used that butcher<br>
knife...would she?)<br>
<p>
And this was 1993-95 sometime.  So I don't think that's it politically correct<br>
for the truth to get out in this case....the proper ideology is Sooooo much<br>
more satisfying.<br>
<p>
Which brings me to another point....regarding "Coming of Age in Somoa" by<br>
Mead, "Mutant Message Down Under" by Marlo Morgan, "the book, Ishmael, "...and<br>
other various and sundry....bogus books...perhaps by Penrose...perhaps by<br>
Einestein?<br>
<p>
How you gonna tell?<br>
<p>
As Will Rogers said (kinda)  "It's not what you don't know that's gonna hurt<br>
you...It's what you DO know that aint so that's gonna hurt you"..<br>
<p>
So how to tell which of these books is valid ...they all sit nice and pretty<br>
in the proper places in the bookstore.."Zen and the Art of Motorcycle<br>
Maintenaince" sitting right down from Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".<br>
...and just up a little from Gould's books..Drexler's books....and a biography<br>
of Noklai Telsa....theyre not labeled "fraud" or "bogus"...they (some of<br>
them). have nice book reviews in the major media....they're even &lt;apparently&gt;<br>
being taught as "real science" in graduate school....<br>
