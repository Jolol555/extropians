Here's a chunk:<br>
<p>
==============================================<br>
<p>
Stine's 1961 article was a deliberately provocative slap at his fellow<br>
speculative writers, usually regarded by sober citizens as crackpots and<br>
lunatic technophiles.  Stine denounced these specialist dreamers and<br>
extrapolators for their stick-in-the-mud conservatism.<br>
<p>
Look at the curves! Stine cried.  What's wrong with you?  Are you all<br>
blind?  A year later, in the wonderful non-fiction book Profiles of the<br>
Future, Arthur C. Clarke diagnosed this same defect as the Failure of<br>
Nerve, and coupled it with another crime, the Failure of Imagination.<br>
Stine was determined to fall victim to neither failing.  The trends were<br>
going asymptotic, he pointed out.  An asymptote is a curve that rises<br>
sharply until it is heading almost straight up the page, and gets closer<br>
and closer to the purely vertical in a shorter and shorter time.  At the<br>
limit, which is reached quite quickly (disproving Zeno's ancient paradox<br>
about the tortoise beating Achilles if it has a head-start), the curve goes<br>
to infinity.  It rips through the top of the graph and is never seen again.  <br>
<p>
When you're tracking the patterns formed in 20th-and-21st centuries by data<br>
on available energy, or transport speed, or numbers of people in a world<br>
afflicted with unchecked over-population, you can get some hair-raising and<br>
very weird results.  Too weird to be true.  In 1973, the transhumanist<br>
sociologist FM-2030, previously known as F. M. Esfandiary, predicted faxes,<br>
satellite cell-phones and something like the Internet (good going!)<br>
together with the feasible-but-impossibly-expensive `hypersonic planes<br>
projected for the late 1980s' that would `zip you anywhere on the planet in<br>
less than forty minutes', not to mention the wildly extravagant hope `that<br>
by 1985 we will be able to postpone aging in a dramatic way' and on to the<br>
truly fatuous: `The use of artificial moons or satellites to control tides<br>
and floods'.  Curves are tricky things to interpret realistically.<br>
<p>
`If you really understand trend curves,' Stine wrote with a perfect poker<br>
face, in 1961, `you can extrapolate them into the future and discover some<br>
baffling things.  The speed trend curve alone predicts that manned vehicles<br>
will be able to achieve near-infinite speeds by 1982.'  Perhaps that seemed<br>
safe enough back then.  Two decades away.  Anything could happen in twenty<br>
years.  Perhaps the horse would talk.  To tell the truth, Stine was<br>
concerned that this prediction might be too conservative. `It may be<br>
sooner.  But the curve becomes asymptotic by 1982.'<br>
<p>
You have probably noticed that this did not happen, except on the<br>
television and movie screens when starships routinely travel at Warp Speed<br>
or burn through wormholes from one side of the galaxy to the other.  It's<br>
quite disappointing.  So where was the flaw in his case?  Surely it wasn't<br>
simply that we didn't yet know how to do such things.  Science keeps<br>
learning new and astonishing things about the world.  We bump into<br>
discontinuities, and have to reformulate our theories, or the theories lead<br>
us into novel facts.  Sociologists of science, as everyone now knows due to<br>
the term's misappropriation by New Agers, dub these major shifts `paradigm<br>
changes'.<br>
<p>
Stine was expecting some very big paradigm changes.<br>
<p>
Led astray by his transport-speed trend, he had noted: `If this is really<br>
the case, a true scientific breakthrough of major importance must be in the<br>
offing in the next twenty years.'  But how could such an infinitely-fast<br>
vehicle be propelled?  Look, say the trend curve had got a little confused,<br>
mistaking Newtonian physics for the more up-to-date Einsteinian variety.<br>
Perhaps we would settle for close to the speed of light, the best one can<br>
hope for in a universe where nothing material can go faster than light?<br>
But that costs a lot, it takes plenty of juice.  Pushing a 100 ton starship<br>
up to 99.99 percent of the speed of light, as close to infinite speed as<br>
we're likely to reach any time soon, you have to pump in so much energy<br>
that the damned thing is a kinetic bomb carrying more than 220 million<br>
megatons locked up in its inertial mass.  Energy equals mass, remember, and<br>
that's how much brute energy it takes to get 100 tons moving that fast.<br>
Luckily, explained Stine, that's okay!  `The trend curve for controllable<br>
energy is rising rapidly...  By 1981, this trend curve shows that a single<br>
man will have available under his control the amount of energy equivalent<br>
to that generated by the entire sun' (his italics).<br>
<p>
Oh dear.  Oh dear oh dear.  I don't think so.<br>
<p>
It would have taken more than a genuine `cold fusion' breakthrough to bring<br>
that one off.  It would have taken a tame black hole in your tank.<br>
<p>
Stine's trend curves, in other words, were totally bogus.  Or rather, they<br>
were just what they seem to be - idle curves linking four or five quite<br>
disparate historical trajectories.  Athletes and swimmers have surpassed<br>
previous records every year on the dot, as they eat better and train more<br>
cunningly and indeed come into the world as bouncing world-beaters, having<br>
enjoyed optimum medically-guided conditions in the womb, but it doesn't<br>
mean that some day an Olympic-class runner will smash the tenth-of-a-second<br>
mile record set an instant earlier by her Reeboked rival.<br>
<p>
Does this dash of cold water mean that the Spike, the technological<br>
Singularity curving up there in the mid-twenty-first century, is nothing<br>
better than a mirage?  Perhaps not.<br>
<p>
It wasn't sheer fantasy Stine was retailing, after all, just a rather<br>
trusting - or wickedly goading - application of the principle `If this goes<br>
on--'.  <br>
<p>
Plenty of things are going on and will not stop before humankind and our<br>
world are changed forever.<br>
<p>
Indeed, in a tip-toeing sequel published in 1986, Stine avoided any mention<br>
of his most preposterous trends and settled for merely utopian expectations:<br>
<p>
`We can't close the Pandora's Box of technology.  Technology is never<br>
forgotten; it's only replaced by better technology.  Because we can't put<br>
the thermonuclear bomb, recombinant DNA, and a host of other technological<br>
wonders back into Pandora's Box and forget them, we must deal with them.<br>
It's not easy.'<br>
<p>
He added: `A hundred years from now, barring an incredible combination of<br>
bad luck and poor management, people everywhere will be many, rich, and<br>
largely in control of the forces of nature.  I've got faith in the<br>
capabilities of human beings.  We'll make it.  Therefore, we must learn how<br>
to be rich and handle abundance because we've never had to do it before.'<br>
<p>
Probably this less extravagant forecast would raise no eyebrows among<br>
`conservative' soothsayers.  In 1996, a team from British<br>
Telecommunications made its futurological report for the period to 2020.<br>
The average western lifespan by that date would be a century.<br>
Self-programming computers were expected as early as 2005, as was full<br>
voice-interaction with machines (IBM, they noted, `has already released a<br>
program that understand clear, continuous speech').  AIs emulating the<br>
human brain might exist by 2016, and by the same date genetic links to all<br>
diseases will have been mapped from the decoded DNA template so everyone<br>
will carry an individual genome record wired into a personal health card.<br>
These projections were modest, befitting a vast corporate institution like BT.<br>
