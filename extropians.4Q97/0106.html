"The Spike" was written by Damien Broderick. Damien is an<br>
Australian  writer of science fiction and science fact.<br>
You can find a bunch of his stuff (but not "the Spike") at<br>
amazon.com.  He is also a professor.<br>
<p>
Damien is also a member of this newsgroup and the transhuan<br>
newsgroup. Last year, a bunch of us began discussing the<br>
singularity and related possible events that may occur<br>
some time during the next 50 years. Some of us believe that<br>
a singularity will occur in this time frame that will precipitate<br>
an abrupt change from our existing civilization to its<br>
successor: a "spike" in the graph of the rate of change,<br>
by rough analogy, probably starting with a small group of<br>
people. Others believe that the ternsision will be broader<br>
both in the number of individuals participating in the early<br>
phases and in the transision time: a "swell".<br>
<p>
Damien converted this discussion into the core of the book.<br>
He made it a lot more coherent, and added a lot of excellent<br>
material, primarily relating to Moravec and Drexler.<br>
<p>
It's fun to read the index, because essentially all of<br>
the list participants in the discussion are listed. Many<br>
of us are quoted at length.<br>
<p>
I'm in there quite a bit, mostly because I'm the most radical<br>
"singularitan," having predicted in May of 1996 that the<br>
singularity would occur within a decade.<br>
<p>
I really like the book.<br>
