<i>&gt; I'm a bit ambivalent about NLP. I have not yet read up heavily on it,</i><br>

<i>&gt; toolbox of more or less different tools with no real underlying Big</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theory. That is of course not necessary as long as the tools work, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; some certainly do. </i><br>
<p>
Yep.  It's a tenet of NLP that practitioners experiment, try what works,<br>
and reject what doesn't work, with no real need for an underlying<br>
theory.<br>
<p>
That having been said, after relatively scant experience with it (a<br>
handful of books over the past few months) I see the outlines of theory.<br>
Or minimally of a set of extensions to the generally conceived<br>
folk-psychological theory.<br>
<p>
I'd characterize the key insights of NLP thus:<br>
<p>
1)  One's identity and emotional landscape are malleable.  Indeed, they<br>
are constantly changing in response to our internal dialog, subjective<br>
experience, interpretation of that experience, the social mirror, etc..<br>
This forms a feedback loop where [ identity &amp; emotional landscape ]<br>
-affects-&gt; action (including internal dialog) -affects-&gt; [ identity &amp;<br>
emotional landscape ].  Thus if we wish to affect our future identity &amp;<br>
emotional landscape, we can do so by modifying our subjective<br>
experience, and also by taking certain actions that sculpt our future<br>
selves.<br>
<p>
2)  Our subjective experience is constructed from multiple qualia, and<br>
is usefully sculptable at this level.  This is elementary cog sci, but<br>
rarely put into use.  For example, most of us at some time use internal<br>
dialog to reason or motivate ourselves.  However, it is far less common<br>
to find individuals who consciously create imagery, sounds, or<br>
kinesthetic experiences with the intent of self-motivation or more<br>
generally self-modification.  (Though I do grant that abstract thinkers<br>
extremely often use visual imagination to explore abstract ideas.)<br>
<p>
3)  Both the /content/ and /structure/ of subjective experience affect<br>
our emotions in predictable ways.  The simplest example of this is the<br>
set of NLP techniques commonly used to cure a phobia.  Generally, it<br>
seems, when a phobic individual is asked to describe the precise content<br>
and structure of their imaginations of the subject of their phobia, the<br>
phobia subject is seen from the first person, very large and near, often<br>
exaggerated in proportion to the seen, in many colors, and with the<br>
scene as a whole occupying the entire visual field.   <br>
<p>
By contrast, when asked to think of something they have extremely little<br>
attachment to, most individuals report that it is moderately distant, of<br>
dull color, moderately small, often seen in a third person perspective<br>
with the individual in the picture at the same time, and quite often the<br>
entire scene takes up a fraction of the visual field or is "bounded"<br>
visually in some way by a border or frame.<br>
<p>
The essence of the NLP "cure" to the phobia, then, is to have the phobic<br>
individual imagine the subject of their phobia in a small, distant,<br>
unthreatening way.<br>
<p>
To me this points to a basic tenet that the /intensity/ and /immediacy/<br>
of a sensation (including an imagined sensation) is proportional to the<br>
intensity of the emotional response evoked.   Again, fairly elementary<br>
on the face of it - the insight of NLP is to use the imagination to<br>
/change/ the intensity and immediacy of a stimuli to evoke the desired<br>
response.<br>
<p>
This can be used both positively and negatively.  For example, I may<br>
have a goal which I rationally believe to be important to my well being<br>
- exercise being a good example - but which I am relatively unmotivated<br>
to pursue.  The NLP solution to this is to vividly imagine the /results/<br>
of the goal, and then link that to a vivid imagination of the /process/<br>
I shall use in attaining that goal.<br>
<p>
A final note on what NLP is and is not:  NLP is a hammer and not a<br>
compass.  That is to say, it is a tool for making modifications of our<br>
own emotional &amp; motivational states, as opposed to a tool for abstract<br>
thinking or problem solving.  Of course, training in NLP includes<br>
training on detailed observation of the world around you, as well as<br>
detailed analysis of one's own life and goal structure, but I find this<br>
to be peripheral to the actual toolset.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But at the same time I notice the tendency for</i><br>
<i>&gt; "believers" of NLP to believe a little bit too strongly in it for my</i><br>
<i>&gt; taste - it seems to have some memetic "cult potential" (I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest it is a real cult, just that it somehow promotes a cohesion</i><br>
<i>&gt; among NLPers and their beliefs that I find unhealthy for critical</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking and strict empirical testing). Since I also recognize that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this may just be my prejudices talking, I get even more ambivalent.</i><br>
<p>
Heh.  This is a tricky subject.  On the one hand you are right to be<br>
skeptical of NLP, if only for the massive, single-minded enthusiasm of<br>
many of its proponents.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, NLP is very much an attempt to leverage our<br>
subjective experience to augment our objective capabilities.  In this<br>
light, belief in the effectiveness of NLP is a boon to the practitioner,<br>
and disbelief is a detriment.  This is essentially a manifestation of<br>
the placebo affect: those who firmly believe in the cure are cured,<br>
those who do not are not.<br>
<p>
I wrestle with this from time to time and have come to the tentative<br>
conclusion that the best course is to separate my /intent/ to cause<br>
something to happen from my objective evaluation of the results.  Which<br>
is to say that I aim to get myself pumped up for an NLP technique,<br>
vividly imagine it suceeding, /believe/ that it will work, and then once<br>
I'm done I must return to a balanced, objective state to analyze the<br>
results of the technique.<br>
<p>
So far, as I said, I've been fairly happy with the results.  I encourage<br>
list members to pick up one of the better NLP introductory books and<br>
give it a shot for themselves.  NLPers seem to agree that the NLP<br>
Comprehensive / Steve Andreas book (NLP: The New Technology of<br>
Achievement) is the best all around introduction to the topic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are there any outside examinations of the efficiacy of NLP methods?</i><br>
<p>
I'm researching this now.  So far I've found relatively little, however<br>
a great many of the NLP techniques are essentially hypnotic techniques,<br>
for which there is a fair bit of evidence of efficiacy.  When I've<br>
compiled my findings I'll post them to the list.<br>
