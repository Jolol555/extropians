Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Pacific giant octopus is basically on a human scale; the giant </i><br>

<i>&gt;cases.</i><br>
<p>
And weighs in at about 1 English Ton.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;and fragments (which are usually sections of tentacle), that have </i><br>
<i>&gt;floated to the surface and washed ashore or otherwise been spotted.</i><br>
<p>
There is a photo in the book of one washed up on a beach.  Sad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(I personally think the giant squid is a bad choice for an uplift </i><br>

<i>&gt;read the previous paragraph.  For another, what we DO know </i><br>

<p>
But their brains are very small, comparatively speaking, and even their<br>
smaller cousins -- other squids -- are not too smart.<br>
 <br>
As for sociality, <a href="http://is.dal.ca/~ceph/redocto.html">http://is.dal.ca/~ceph/redocto.html</a> calims Octopus<br>
rubescens, or the red octopus, ("a small speceis that are found in the<br>
Eastern Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Alaska.) has been reported to<br>
school.  In others words, herd, which is an indication of social behavior.<br>
