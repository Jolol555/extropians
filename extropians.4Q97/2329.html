Eugene Leitl asks-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Very well, what should we do? Autodafe the designers?  Wipe out criminally</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointy-haired decision-makers, and the mob which adapts to broken designs</i><br>
<i>&gt; stampedeing all over the marketplace? Pass me that torch, please. </i><br>
<p>
Mob vs. mob :-) ?<br>
<p>
Anyway, my intent was really on the level I wrote about: awareness as<br>
users, inhabitants or (gulp) consumers.  Which of us has never said<br>
"how stupid of me," having backed into the sharp edge of some bad design?<br>
The reason I wrote that rant is that I actually find it hard to<br>
explain why it's so bad to blame ourselves in such situations.  The<br>
assumption of adaptation-as-virtue is subtle and insidious.<br>
<p>
The worst thing about techie culture is the people who take to <br>
detailed rules like fish to water, who soak up Windows .DLLs and<br>
modem control strings... To the uninitiated these look like the<br>
smart guys.  We the smart people (this is one of those sentence <br>
structures where you get to decide whether you want to be included in <br>
"we") need to stop acting the technerd so much, at least not without<br>
a clear disclaimer.  Knowing how to set a VCR clock (okay, it's a<br>
metaphor--or is this synecdoche?) is not smart, it's monkeysheepish.<br>
And a certain percentage of *those nerds*... but wait.<br>
<p>
The problem, but also the opportunity, is that we smart people often<br>
have nerd abilities.  The problem is that by displaying them we<br>
spread the association among ourselves that nerds are smart and well-<br>
adapted.  The opportunity is that we can have the clear attitude that <br>
having to do nerdy things is a stupid imposition of stupid designs by <br>
actual people who have done something wrong.  By being smart<br>
and having that attitude we can spread the association that it's <br>
*more* smart to be critical of technology, designs in general, and to<br>
resist the role of the frenetic self-dribbling sheep-monkey.<br>
<p>
Anyway as I was ranting: a certain percentage of those clever but not <br>
smart nerds graduate to a position where they're actually designing things <br>
and the cycle is perpetuated.  Oh boy more complicated toys to be the <br>
expert at!  We have to saw them off from membership in the smart club, but <br>
give them (and ourselves) a path to redemption.  We have to isolate them <br>
from the general populace until the fever dies down and some sense sets <br>
in, or else...<br>
<p>
...Everybody's got an uncle who knew nothing about computers (for instance--<br>
computers seem to be serving as the point of this nerdification wedge)<br>
and then got one, and now he reads all the magazines and comes to <br>
Thanksgiving dinner and can't talk about anything but cache memory and<br>
local bus.<br>
<p>
In this uncle-at-Thanksgiving sense we're right in the middle of an <br>
insane culture (&amp; p.s. I love people who pick up new enthusiasms and take<br>
things into their own hands.  I just hate that we have such piss-poor,<br>
sheep-monkey enthusiasms to give them.) and so we're right where things need <br>
to be changed, and we're just the people who would be paid attention <br>
to--if we would wake our own selves up from the trance and start pointing <br>
out the stupidity.<br>
<p>
That seems like a big step to me, the switch in attitude.  From there it<br>
can't help reflect back on design as something done by people, which<br>
should be (but isn't) done for people, etc.  But you have to start with<br>
an awareness of what the problem is, where it hits home, how deeply.<br>
