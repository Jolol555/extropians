Visiting the Reconstructive Surgery unit this morning (if you must know,<br>
I'm having my penis redone to resemble Bill Clinton's), I said to the<br>
charming young doctor, after she'd finished scrutinising my radiograms,<br>
`There's one other thing, quite unconnected - I had a blood test a few<br>
weeks back and turned out to have shocking high cholesterol.  Of course I<br>
have now changed my life-style from top to toe, and I'm wondering how soon<br>
it would be useful to get retested?'  She gazed at my with indignation and<br>
cried, `I'm a *plastic surgeon*!'  <br>
<p>
Mortified by my social gaffe, I mumbled my apologies, and she added,<br>
`Probably six weeks.'  <br>
<p>
Amazing, I thought.  Here I am, on the net, surrounded by people happy to<br>
offer arcane items of info - from their professional stock or gleaned from<br>
hungry curiosity - and this not-at-all-pretentious woman was genuinely if<br>
briefly taken aback that I should expect her to recall something so<br>
low-level, so beneath her status.  <br>
<p>
[Um.  This stifled outburst is probably the result of just having browsed<br>
in the ferociously intelligent and widely curious home page of<br>
