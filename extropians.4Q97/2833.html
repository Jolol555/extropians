<i>&gt;family harmony.</i><br>

The problem I see here -- and I'm not about to becom a scholar of the<br>
subject -- is that too many people seem bent on reading into Mead's<br>
(and other's) work(s) to support a political agenda.<br>
<p>
Even so, I tend to think that anyone who makes wildly utopian claims<br>
about another society, especially one that only a handful of people<br>
have had contact with, are distorting the truth.  This might be<br>
unintentional, but I'm wary of such claims, for the same reason I'm<br>
wary of spam which claims I can make $1K a day.<br>
