<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SOmeone a bit back cited that one is more likely to be murdered in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US than in Northern Ireland, yet why is it that many more</i><br>
<i>&gt; Northern Irish immigrate or travel as tourists to the US than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reverse??</i><br>
<p>
I question this, simply because there are more people of northern <br>
Irish descent living in the US than in Northern Ireland.  (There's a <br>
tad more room for them, for one thing.)<br>
<p>
Now I could easily believe that the *percentage* of people in <br>
northern Ireland who wish to travel to the US (temporarily or <br>
permanently) is higher than the percentage of people in the US -- <br>
even if you restrict consideration to those of northern Irish descent <br>
-- who wish to travel to Northern Ireland.<br>
<p>
One reason for this is a psychological factor: many people of <br>
European descent in the US think of visits to their ancestral <br>
European homeland as visits to "the old country" and much of Europe <br>
still looks upon the Americas as "the new world" -- and, particularly <br>
in the US but to some extent in most of the industrialized world, <br>
there is a bias in favor of the new as compared to the old.<br>
<p>
(I'd be interested in seeing some statistics to show whether I'm <br>
right about that or not.  I confess to having nothing but <br>
reasonable-sounding speculation.)<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Fourth-  There is a lack of correct historical perspective-  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many of us have heard about the "Wild, wild west?  Crime rates in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the late 1800s in the US were low-  Do you really think that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bunch of civil war veterans on the western frontier would let a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gang terrorize their town?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that the "wild wild west" was the first example of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensationalist tendencies of the free American press, but I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the term came more from the habitat, originally.</i><br>
<p>
You know, "Wild Wild West" really *should* be capitalized: it's the <br>
name of a touring theater company and the series of plays they did.<br>
