Thanks.  This was a fun e-mail. -Bill.<br>

<i>&gt; I first sent this to the list about a year ago, seemed like a good time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; send it again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ===========================================================================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt; that has mass or energy or carries information. Strangely, some things have</i><br>
<i>&gt; none of these attributes, although calling them "things" may be stretching a</i><br>
<i>&gt; point. It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantly and for unlimited distances. One system can influence another</i><br>
<i>&gt; system on the other side of the universe without the slightest delay,  but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; carries no information because the receiving system just changes from  one</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparently random mode to another, it's only when you compare the two systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and that can only be done at light speed or less) does the  correspondence</i><br>
<i>&gt; between the two systems become obvious. The 2 random modes  have equal energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; so energy is not transferred either.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A less spooky example could be found in the idea of Phase Speed. I'm standing</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the center of a huge hollow sphere 2 light years in diameter,  I've been</i><br>
<i>&gt; there for a long time and I'm holding a powerful LASER that makes a  spot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; light on the distant wall of the sphere one light year away.  Suddenly, still</i><br>
<i>&gt; holding the LASER and in the space of one second I make a  complete 360</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree turn. Exactly 2 years later an observer standing at the same place</i><br>
<i>&gt; would see the spot move much faster than light, it would travel  the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumference of the sphere, 2PI or 6.28 light years in only  one second.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No photon moved faster  than light however, and no energy or  information</i><br>
<i>&gt; between any two points traveled faster than light. A photon of  light moves</i><br>
<i>&gt; at light speed and carries energy and information, a spot of light can move</i><br>
<i>&gt; at any speed but carries neither energy nor information.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And then there are Tachyons. Actually relativity does not forbid matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving  faster than light , it forbids matter moving AT the speed of light.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's almost the same thing but not quite. Perhaps a particle could somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt; tunnel past the speed of light or maybe Tachyons have always moved faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; than light from the first instant of The Big Bang..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; People have looked for Tachyons but have never found the slightest evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they exist in nature, much to the relief of physicists. Tachyons are an</i><br>
<i>&gt; embarrassment, the faster they move less energy they have, one that moved</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a little faster than light would have a lot of energy, one that moved at an</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinite velocity would have zero energy. Much worse, Tachyons move backward</i><br>
<i>&gt; in time, they arrive at their destination before they start. You could</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate with the past.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even though they have never been detected and the laws of physics do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; demand that Tachyons exist, they don't seem to forbid them either. Most think</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature is totalitarian, if it's not forbidden then it's mandatory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons? It would if anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; saw them, but suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her crime and</i><br>
<i>&gt; brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Damn, I just knocked my coffee cup off the table, what a mess! I'm REALLY not</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the mood to clean it up, I think I'll use my Gateway 14,400 Tachyon modem</i><br>
<i>&gt; and send myself some E mail 5 minutes ago. I'll just hit the send key and</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ....brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be</i><br>
<i>&gt; careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means</i><br>
<i>&gt; oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life, nature just will</i><br>
<i>&gt; not allow anybody to observe a paradox.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know what you're thinking, How could John be so stupid, he must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely out of his mind, why else would he deliberately buy an obsolete</i><br>
<i>&gt; 14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 28,800 model is too expensive, besides I have it on VERY good authority that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gateway will drop the price next year.</i><br>
