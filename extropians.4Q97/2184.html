<p>

Intel will make more money on increased profitability rather than demand.<br>
While demand tends to grow slowly and relatively steadily, the real<br>
profitability will be in the near-term decrease in competition.  Intel's<br>
aggressive price cutting has typically only occurred when faced with<br>
competition.  As soon as the competition disappears or becomes ineffective,<br>
aggressive price cutting stops and Intel's profit margins soar.  Intel will<br>
milk current architectures for all they are worth with little investment in<br>
making significant improvements in their bread &amp; butter products as long as<br>
their are no viable competitors.  I believe we are moving into a period<br>
where competition against Intel will be relatively weak.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for Cisco.  Well, I work for Newbridge, so I'm biased.  Obviously, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think this market will grow substantially.  But, will Cisco continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dominate so completely?  They don't have the advantage that Intel does in</i><br>
<i>&gt;that competitors (like Newbridge) don't have to clone Cisco products, just</i><br>
<i>&gt;interwork with them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Cisco has so thoroughly dominated several markets that I know of many large<br>
corporations that won't buy anything except Cisco products, much in the<br>
same way most large companies purchase Microsoft products for their<br>
business desktops.  In a lot of IS departments, its a matter of "No one<br>
ever got fired for buying Cisco products" mentality.  Having personally<br>
used networking products from several companies, I don't see an inherent<br>
superiority in most of Cisco's products, but their market presence is hard<br>
to avoid, let alone compete with.  For many people "Cisco" is synonymous<br>
with "internetworking".  Short of Cisco *seriously* fumbling the ball<br>
(something I do not think will happen), they should remain THE dominant<br>
company in this market.<br>
