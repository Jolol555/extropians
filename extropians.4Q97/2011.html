<i>&gt;&gt; Actually we are about to make a change. To post to the Extropians list you</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; able to read only.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I may be a little premature in saying this (since you haven't given your</i><br>
<i>&gt;"hows and whys"), but I think this decision may turn some good people off</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropy.  Having to pay to join an institute to participate on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion has a culty feel to it, even if the justification is to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt;the signal-to-noise ratio.  </i><br>
<p>
I can't dispute that you have the experience of a culty feel. But I invite<br>
you to consider the following:<br>
<p>
Is the Rotary a cult? is the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies a<br>
cult? Is 4-H a cult? Is the specialty-certified service station I take my<br>
car to a cult? How about the letters-to-the-Editor column of Scientific<br>
American?<br>
<p>
In each of these examples, members are selected, and "dues" of one sort or<br>
another must have been paid.<br>
<p>
As for participation in discussion, there's always the CRIT engine.<br>
Bidirectional links permit open communication across the boundary, while<br>
keeping the SSNR higher. Kind of like a sodium pump. :)<br>
<p>
You say they don't know about CRIT? Well, they'll just have to learn, won't<br>
they? :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, I don't think being a member of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropy institute implies you make less "noise."  </i><br>
<p>
Being born a Presbyterian doesn't guarantee you a seat in the Choir Invisible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some people may join the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.</i><br>
<p>
Begging your pardon, it doesn't matter what their intent is, it matters<br>
what the result is. Some reasonable people think the SSNR is too high. One<br>
man's signal is another man's noise. Otherwise, why not just have one big<br>
maillist for everyone on the net? Reductio ad absurdum, QED, E Pluribus Unum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Others, who would contribute a lot to the list, may not be interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;joining the extropy institute, either for monetary reasons or because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not want to incur the wrath of those who would take out their petty</i><br>
<i>&gt;frustrations on the members of the extropian movement.(ie. misguided</i><br>
<i>&gt;neo-luddites) </i><br>
<p>
Every decision has a cost. Good people are not doing their best on the list<br>
right now because of the current state of affairs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One restriction I would like to see is allowing only list-members to post.</i><br>
<p>
Have you heard about the two message-credit-token plans? :) :)<br>
