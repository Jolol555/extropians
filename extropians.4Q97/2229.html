<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know. Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same. Someone on the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but can't tell whether it's something solid or just a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whatever...) and the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not going to slow down because some backseater 'thinks' he sees</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; something. So here we are rushing toward an object that could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall of concrete. After some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discussion the still unclear object is now to close for a full stop,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what happens' or the ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is' at the lowest speed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize the damage (if any).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Really bad analogy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A better analogy:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're driving along a road through low hills.  It's a rather twisty </i><br>
<i>&gt; road and you can't see all that far ahead, but you're driving at a </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable speed.  One of the back seat passengers thinks he sees a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fog bank up ahead, and says that he vaguely remembers the road </i><br>
<i>&gt; turning abruptly downhill somewhere along here.  Another back seat </i><br>
<i>&gt; passenger says he saw no fog bank, and remembers the first backseater </i><br>
<i>&gt; claiming a few days before that the road turns abruptly UPhill.  A </i><br>
<i>&gt; third backseater (it's a big vehicle) says that if we go any higher </i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll run out of oxygen, and a fourth points at the lambs gamboling </i><br>
<i>&gt; at the top of a nearby hill and claims the oxygen problem ain't so.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Meanwhile the first backseater claims we're near sea level and so </i><br>
<i>&gt; going down could be bad, and the fourth guy notices that off in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; distance (through a conveniently timed gap) it appears we can see a </i><br>
<i>&gt; lot further down and there's no sign of an ocean.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And in response to this confusion, some want us to come to a dead </i><br>
<i>&gt; halt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; An international panel of scientists have some pretty good theories</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that something will happen to the global climate</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global </i><br>
<i>&gt; warming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; due to the usage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fossile fuels</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, if the ice-age theorists (who were the panick mongering </i><br>
<i>&gt; government-must-intervene-to-save-us crowd when I was in high school) </i><br>
<i>&gt; are right, then the usage of fossil fuels might be why we AREN'T </i><br>
<i>&gt; having problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (the only countries that don't agree with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IPCC-reports are a few OPEC-members). Increased downward infrared</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; flux trough increased CO2 concentration is a well-accepted fact (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; maybe a way to terraform Mars someday). The precise effects on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; global climate system cannot be estimated at this point, it may take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; another 10 to 15 years to find conclusive evidence for (or against)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a human-induced climatechange.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no need to wait for this evidence at all.  We can state </i><br>
<i>&gt; categorically that previous eras when the temperature was rather </i><br>
<i>&gt; higher than it is today were clearly NOT caused by human technology </i><br>
<i>&gt; (being as they occurred variously before the dawn of man, up to as </i><br>
<i>&gt; late as about the time humans started trying to domesticate fire).  </i><br>
<i>&gt; We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT </i><br>
<i>&gt; environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That </i><br>
<i>&gt; while there have been fluctuation in shorelines all over the place </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the time, there is no compelling evidence that any particular </i><br>
<i>&gt; fluctuation was due to temperature variations in the range the </i><br>
<i>&gt; global-warming-doomsday theorists are predicting.  (The </i><br>
<i>&gt; ice-age-doomsday theorists, score rather differently on this point.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We can further state with confidence that human action did not make </i><br>
<i>&gt; all that much difference in the CO2 content of the atmosphere over </i><br>
<i>&gt; this century -- and the times it WOULD have made what difference it </i><br>
<i>&gt; DID make, don't match up with the times of temperature changes or CO2 </i><br>
<i>&gt; level changes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But: if nothing is done before then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it may very well be too late do to anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given the fact that we have a resonable indication that something is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; going to happen that _may_ be very damaging to to the only habitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; planet we have it does not seem unreasonable to try to do something</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But what?  The choices are, with no particular reason to believe one </i><br>
<i>&gt; over another:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (a) an ice age is coming, we need to increase the greenhouse effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (b) we're increasing the greenhouse effect and threatening to cook </i><br>
<i>&gt; our planet, we need to reduce the greenhouse effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (c) neither of these is happening, there's no big deal</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (IMHO).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Maybe we could somehow include the cost of bonding the CO2 again (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reforrestation) in the price of gasoline or electricity, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alternative for complex regulation. That way anybody can drive (&amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fly) as much as he/she want as long as the true global cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 'closed-cycle' consumption is paid. The funds could be used (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; oilcompanies?) to plant trees that will bond atmospheric carbon or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; put into energy research.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may be </i><br>
<i>&gt; that you are wrong about the solution.  The fundamental need is to </i><br>
<i>&gt; increase the amount of organic matter.  If your solution compels poor </i><br>
<i>&gt; people on marginal land to continue the agricultural practices now </i><br>
<i>&gt; turning that marginal land into desert, you are being </i><br>
<i>&gt; counter-productive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what Clinton </i><br>
<i>&gt; proposes US businesses should pay out of their own pockets each year </i><br>
<i>&gt; to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to dumping dusts of </i><br>
<i>&gt; metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern oceans, we might </i><br>
<i>&gt; solve the problem not only for the US, but for the entire world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is, still, assuming for the sake of argument that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; global-warming doomsayers are right in their predictions.  What if </i><br>
<i>&gt; the ice-age doomsayers are right?</i><br>
