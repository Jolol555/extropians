I agree, though the tests for sentience is a whole topic in itself.  And a<br>
very important <br>
one I admit.:)<br>

<p>
But I've heard owls represent as close as we can get to an intelligent<br>
bird.  It might be that connections are more important.  If we can<br>
redesign their brains to be more efficient... faster, more compact, less<br>
conserved wetware, more to-the-point (i.e., info processing) stuff...<br>
then it might be possible.<br>
<p>
I would much rather experiment initially with organisms that have a<br>
short development cycle, which makes, out of Warrl kyree<br>
Tale'sedrin's list avians and invertabrates very likely candidates.<br>
We can take a page from the MIT robot lab: start simple, then add<br>
more stuff.<br>
