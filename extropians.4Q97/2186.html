<i>&gt; But how can we tell if a mathematical point is rotating or not? If we can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell, then there's no way to know if it's rotating fast enough. I don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; much beyond this, but the fact that normal BH's can rotate (or even do rotate)</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't mean this "can't be enough" to form a ring singularity. I brought this</i><br>
<i>&gt; up because it seems like ring singularities would pretty useful things for</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding more about gravity wells and possibly wormholes.</i><br>
<p>
We can't yet say they "do" rotate or anything else, because we can't<br>
yet say they in fact exist; black holes, though they are on the old<br>
conventional well-accepted end of speculation, are still speculation.<br>
In all cases, though, they are not a "mathematical point" as you<br>
describe.  They have mass, charge, and angular momentum.  In this<br>
"normal" configuration, the singlularity is a point at the center of<br>
the spherical mass.  In this state, rotation is not sufficient to<br>
produce any of the truly bizarre spatio-temporal effects claimed of<br>
toroidial ones.  There is also, of course, no model even in the realm<br>
of speculation for any process that might create a toroidial or other<br>
non-ideal black hole.<br>
