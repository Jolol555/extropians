That subject heading is an ad hominem, an attempt<br>
to belittle the speaker. I have not swallowed Huben's <br>
line, I've been proposing this line since around '93,<br>
before I read Huben. As I recall, he does not address <br>
the moral theory,  but maybe the case is the same as <br>
his. If so, I should read up on it again and cite <br>
him when and where I propose this again.<br>
<p>
Further, Anton knows that putting my name in the <br>
subject heading in an ad hominem fashion got me upset<br>
before, leading to list fueding, but he does it again,<br>
clearly a second initiation of ad hominem muck.<br>

<i>&gt;You've forgotten one thing. The Washington regime did not get here</i><br>
<i>&gt;first. It was created, by people and states with pre-existing land</i><br>
<i>&gt;claims, and exists by virtue of a contract -- which it has broken.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the government doesn't like the contract which allows it to exist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than amending it by unilateral fiat (i.e. appointing judges to</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpret that the contract couldn't possibly mean what it says), it</i><br>
<i>&gt;should leave our land.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A better analogy is between the government and a carpenter</i><br>
<i>&gt;hired to repair a stairway, who once inside the house pulls a gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;and says "This house is mine now, and if you don't like it you</i><br>
<i>&gt;can leave."</i><br>

 IAN: OK, so if your going to go with the X people were<br>
 here 100 years before Y people 200+ years ago, then you <br>
 should call for the transition of power from the federal <br>
 government to a council of Native Americans, since their <br>
 great great grandparents were here with preexisting claims <br>
 BEFORE those you cite were here before the government. <br>
<p>
 Or do property rights begin only with Europeans?<br>
