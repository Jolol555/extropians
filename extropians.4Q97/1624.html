OK, now the neutral Swede is in this debate too.  I have great<br>
sympathy with all sides. :-)<br>
<p>
I think Excedo is a good name, no doubt about it. The initial Ex- fits<br>
in well with the transhuman memes, and the ending do at least gives me<br>
associations to action.<br>
<p>
Is it too close to Extropy? That is very subjective. I think the core<br>
morphem of extropianism is of course extro-; not just the outwards<br>
'ex', but the movement of 'tro'. Extropy without the trope is<br>
something very different.<br>
<p>
I think Shaun is too worried about the similarity, but in principle he<br>
is correct: the name suggests a similarity (but that might be<br>
*positive*, since both groups are on the same side and share many<br>
ideas, it would be silly for humanists to avoid having "humanist" in<br>
their organisational names), and there is a real risk/chance of being<br>
linked with ExI (in Europe this can have tricky political connotations;<br>
here in Sweden being a classic *liberal* is considered extreme,<br>
libertarianism is beyond the pale). <br>
<p>
This is not likely to be a large or permanent problem, so I think we<br>
should not invest too much emotional capital in this. The main problem<br>
right now seems to be that a lot of us onlookers are cheering on the<br>
two sides, almost forcing them into a silly confrontation.  I'm not<br>
sure I have any good solution, other than hope Max and Arjen can<br>
discuss this and come up with a good solution. As transhumanists, we<br>
all realize that names are merely (useful) labels, what really counts<br>
is the contents.<br>
