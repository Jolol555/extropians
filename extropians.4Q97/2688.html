    No I understand what you're saying.  I know we can't really prove the<br>
purpose for anything, or that there was a creator, etc., etc.  I think that<br>
fact has been well established.  I just like to toy with these ideas, and I<br>
personally think _anything_ is possible.  Let me tell you a little story.<br>
I've come to believe there are elements, of a perhaps you can call them<br>
"higher power".  Not necessarily a "god".  I think the idea of a deity with a<br>
personailty running things is fairly absured (and yes I know I said I think<br>
anythings possible ).  But there are far too many unexplained occurences out<br>
there, they can't even begin to be explained with our ways of explaining<br>
things now.  Even Hawkings himself said he now is starting to disbelieve some<br>
of his own statements, because the evidence of a "devine force" is so<br>
strong.  Any ways, on with my story...    It had to do with the computer Im<br>
using right now in fact.  So I ordered my computer, I was psyched. After just<br>
sleeping really heavily, I awoke, and once I managed to straighten out my<br>
thought I began to think about the computer and wondered when it was coming<br>
(it was due to arrive at any time close to when this occured).  So I sort of<br>
asked/listened, and in my head sort of day dreamingly envisioned a yellow<br>
rider semitruck.  Whoopy I thought, what was that supposed to mean, and I<br>
discarded the idea.  Later on, the computer was supposed to have come, but<br>
had not.  Strange I thought.  And at the end of that day, I began walking<br>
home from school (yes I'm 16).  I noticed a particular friend I sometime got<br>
a ride home with, and thought to myself, should I ask for a ride...and<br>
eventually I did.  Oddly enough, that day, he could only take me up to the<br>
end of my street, because he had to hurry right back to the school for<br>
something.  So he did, and as I was walking up my final stretch of road, I<br>
had an impulse to look back, and what else did I see other than a yellow<br>
rider semitruck.  Whoa, I thought, strange as hell.  So I got home, and began<br>
to think about my "vision".  Playing with this whole pyschic idea, I thought<br>
well let's toy with this, and pick a time.  So I did, something like 3:10.<br>
And right at 3:10 I heard a car engine in my drive way - it was a friend.  Oh<br>
well.  Events like that continued through the day, but the UPS man still<br>
hadn't arrive with my computer.  So I began to get discouraged and said to<br>
myself, "Fine, I'll pick a final time and after that I give up."  So I did,<br>
4:53.  I was almost asleep on my couch when the phone rang, it was another<br>
friend, we began to talk when I heard my dog barking and looked out the<br>
window.  It was the UPS man.  He had my computer.  Now if I hadn't had to<br>
walk to pick up the phone I wouldn't have been able to catch a look at the<br>
clock.  It was 4:53.  And if I hadn't bothered to look back on my last road I<br>
wouldn't have seen that yellow rider truck.  And if my friend had been able<br>
to drop me off at my house, as usual, I would have missed it all together, or<br>
if I had walked.<br>
    So tell me what does this mean?  Probability?  Was this bound to happen?<br>
I've come to believe some things happen for a reason.  How and why, I can't<br>
explain.  But I've had too many similar things happen to just throw it aside<br>
and blow it off the idea.  Now I recount this story in total honesty.  I know<br>
you have no way of nowing this, but I hope that you can trust my word.  One<br>
time while I was sitting down philosophising on demensions up to the 5th or<br>
so, I sort of ran over an interesting thought/theory.  It sort of would<br>
explain these occurances, not to mention many other similar unexplained<br>
things.  I'm sure you'd probably consider them fairly barbaric, but who knows<br>
maybe not.  If you'd like to hear them I'd be happy to tell them.  And btw, I<br>
think after this post, the subject needs to be changed :) No mention of guns<br>
her.<br>
