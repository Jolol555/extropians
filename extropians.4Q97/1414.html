<i>&gt; This may seem wrong, because surely our minds are capable of logical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; arithmetic reasoning.  However I believe in practice we are only capable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of an approximation to strict perfection in logic and arithmetic, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is required by a formal system.  For one thing, we are limited in the size</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the propositions we can consider, understand, and prove.  For another,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we make mistakes.  When we find ourselves in a contradiction, we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; melt down and find ourselves believing that every proposition is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a formal system would.  Instead we abandon one of our beliefs (or else</i><br>
<i>&gt; segregate the inconsistencies in our minds somehow).</i><br>
<p>
Why not program computer in a similar way? I think program that uses<br>
guesses could many times finds proof faster than program that thinks<br>
formally. Conjectures would be zero order uncertain proofs.<br>
<p>
Does there exist any material about this somewhere?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Tibetan - English - Dictionary of Buddhist Teaching &amp; Practice</i><br>
I found: ma nges pa'i rtags : uncertain proof / reason<br>
;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now I think Penrose would deny these two points; he would say that even</i><br>
<i>&gt; very large proofs could in principle be verified if we took them step by</i><br>
<i>&gt; step, and secondly he says that even if individuals make mistakes, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; the community of mathematicians notices and corrects them.  So you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to expand your formal system to include an uploaded community, and now it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is supposed to incorporate strict, perfect adherence to logic.</i><br>
<p>
I think that he has done just that...<br>

By STFW (searching the fine web) with keywords penrose, goedel, random<br>
I found this:<br>
