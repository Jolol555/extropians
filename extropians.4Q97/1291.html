Hi guys, this is my 2 cent worth on this infinity<br>
Thanks for all the contributions,....<br>
I do feel rather heady now, so thanks for the hyperlinks<br>
to CH pages,...that helps,....I did read Rudy Rucker's Infinity<br>
and the Mind,... a another heady; giddy affair again for me...<br>
I'd like to agree that there is no way for proving the CH<br>
to be either true or false, a la Godel ; which states if we construct<br>
a proof that is either incomplete or inconsistent...and dealing with<br>
infinities, I have no expirence,...can anyone shoot me down?<br>
to show that a proof construct to prove or disprove CH will<br>
be either incomplete or inconsistent,thus a never-ending story<br>
( just like this discussion on INFINITIES seems to heading towards<br>
some infinite point....hey hey hey )<br>
<p>
So I want to throw a spanner in, if I may,...about unnameable<br>
infinities or numbers,...which also appears in RR's books,...<br>
where a number can never be described given even the entire<br>
universe as a coding system or extentions etc etc....and even for<br>
a given inifinite amount of time to describe it in....<br>
<p>
Can the 'reciprocals' of such numbers exist within the real number line?<br>
If so, these numbers obviously 'infinite' in number,...( hopefully I'm<br>
right<br>
to say ; the number of such 'things' are larger than the transcendentals<br>
; the number of transcendentals obviously 'infinitely' larger than the<br>
irrationals....!!! ) I think I better stop here before I wander into<br>
the firing squad line,...One can almost imagine the quantum mechanical<br>
nature of space-time itself as a analogy to exploring ever-increasing<br>
smaller intervals on the real line,....like the space-time continuum<br>
it hits some kind of 'Planck's Limit' and become a fractal mess of<br>
'uncertainity' ?!??!? ( Planckian-like limit is these unnameables )<br>
<p>
Am I making any sense here,...Let me try to put it in another way...<br>
a quasi-layman approach,... to say just like the Quantum Physics says<br>
that we cannot determine exactly one property of a particle without<br>
losing the accuracy of another property of the same measured partical<br>
...can be said to be analogous to Godel's Incompleteness theorem<br>
which says one can never generate a complete theory without<br>
inconststencies and vici-versa.....!!!<br>
So just like adding one to one equals two on paper<br>
is actualize by puting one apple beside another making 2 apples....!<br>
<p>
Does Godel put a limit to what we can actually say about CH and<br>
other related matters,....I think it does ?! Pls help out<br>
( if so put a limt to this discussion on Infinities or mine !? )<br>
<p>
Not to lose sight of our extropian objectives, is how these<br>
infinities or INFINITIES will even affect our extropian objectives<br>
or put limits or no limits to our objectives,....<br>
<p>
Still reeling<br>
