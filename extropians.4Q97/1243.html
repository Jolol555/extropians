<i>&gt; I've been remaining quiet with respect to the 'Big Bang' thread, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons I explain more fully below.  However, the use of my name in vain by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr. Hollick has induced me to write this message.</i><br>
<p>
      Hello, Carl,<br>
                                                   8 November 1997<br>
      Thanks for responding.<br>
      <br>
      My reference was to Feynman pere, not to Feynman fils.  &gt;:-} I had <br>
      wondered if you were related, but it seemed unfair to ask you "Are <br>
      you Richard Feynman's son?' -- I know that David Friedman just <br>
      _hates_ being referred to as 'Son-of-Milton' -- and I'd be more <br>
      interested in your own contributions to science etc.  However, I do <br>
      thank you for your interesting response, which allows me to explain <br>
      a few things, and to ask you a few questions.<br>
<p>
      I have many of your father's books.  I revere his work, and would <br>
      have loved to meet him personally, not just through his work.  We <br>
      both met at at least one person he mentions -- Werner Erhard, of <br>
      Erhard Seminars Training ('est').<br>
<p>
<p>
      Just like your father, I take nothing for granted, and I always <br>
      think things out for myself.  I also propound a refreshing and <br>
      elegantly simple way of looking at nature's ways, based precisely on <br>
      Werner Heisenberg's proposition that:  "Classical Mechanics is <br>
      everywhere exactly 'right', wherever its concepts can be applied."<br>
<p>
<p>
      Feynman Sr. (as well as his colleague John Wheeler) is well-known as <br>
      having studied the work of Walter Ritz [1908] very intensively. Ritz <br>
      proposed a quantized particle theory of light, working within a <br>
      Galilean framework, with 'particles fictives' (functionally <br>
      _identical_ to 'virtual photons') acting as electromagnetic force <br>
      carriers.  Read Paul Forman of the Smithsonian, writing on Ritz and <br>
      his work in the Scribners volumes of Scientific Biography.<br>
<p>
      Yet your father never seemed to _acknowledge Ritz's priority_ in his <br>
      writings.  To be sure, QED is less complete than Ritz's theory (no <br>
      treatment of gravity); and is at variance with it on a few points. <br>
      But the similarities between Ritz and QED are _overwhelming_.  In <br>
      one way, this delights me, since it neatly torpedoes most of the <br>
      'difficult' objections to the ballistic theory of light ('light <br>
      cannot be particles; light cannot travel at more and less than 'c').<br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;&gt;&gt;QED "resolves" this wave/particle duality by saying that light is </i><br>
      made of particles (as Newton originally thought)... &lt;&lt;&lt; -- Richard <br>
      Feynman, "Photons: Particles of Light", QED [1985], Ch. 2.<br>
<p>
      To which I add: "we can calculate the actual positions of photons, <br>
      predictively and retrodictively, with increasing precision."<br>
<p>
      I do this by proposing that photons _ARE_ matter -- they're composed <br>
      of positrinos (like positrons but many orders of magnitude smaller); <br>
      and electrinos (like electrons, but many orders of magnitude <br>
      smaller).  I sacrifice 'virtual photons' and 'particles fictives' in <br>
      favour of Faradayan aetherless electric, magnetic and gravitational <br>
      forces which are intrinsic properties of matter.  See William Koller <br>
      Berkson's incomparable work, "Fields of Force" (RKP [1974] ).<br>
<p>
      Feynman Sr.'s inexplicable omission of Walter Ritz and R.A. Waldron <br>
      is regrettable.  In another way, it pisses me off, since [A] Ritz <br>
      had priority; and [B] the omission of his name and references means <br>
      that successive scientists working in this subject-area have to <br>
      re-create the ballistic theory all over again, and work through the <br>
      supposedly 'refuting' objections to it, all of which fall over, and <br>
      wave their weedy little legs pathetically in the air.<br>
<p>
      Just read ace mathematician R.A. Waldron's brilliant study, "The <br>
      Wave and Ballistic Theories of Light -- A Critical Review" <br>
      (Frederick Muller, [1977] ).<br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can assure you that neither of us understands your cockamamie </i><br>
<i>&gt; renunciation of twenetieth-century physics.  Well, my father might</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand it, but he certainly doesn't agree with it.</i><br>
<p>
      I have easily proved you wrong on both counts regarding Feynman <br>
      Sr.'s position.  He concedes my key assertions explicitly!<br>
<p>
      He clearly either hadn't _read_ Popper on propensities (a bit <br>
      unlikely, that, but still possible); or he didn't understand Popper <br>
      (inconceivable).  You'll have to speak for yopurself on both these <br>
      questions.<br>
<p>
      He might well have _disagreed with Popper, of course -- that's his <br>
      right!  As Sir Karl would be the first to agree...   &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      Then you -- inexplicably? -- stray into 'flame-bait' territory...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not going to bother transcribing the rest of the paragraph.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; because I am assuming that (a) the vast majority of people on this list</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not agree with you...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
    As my TOP GUN air combat fighter pilot chum inscribed in his cockpit:<br>
<p>
             "NEVER ASSUME --- *** C H E C K ! ! ! ***"<br>
<p>
<p>
    Anyway, since when did science decide questions by head-counting?  Or <br>
    bean-counting?  "Compare and evaluate the Research Programmes."  Or <br>
    are you into some kind of Kuhnian daftness, where science is a matter <br>
    of mob psychology rather than rational theoretical progress?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; (b) you will never change your mind, no matter how hard anyone tries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; On what grounds do I assume (b)?  I don't know you personally, but I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen the work of lots of people who have, like you, come up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; complete reconstruction of physics according to radical new principles.  </i><br>
<p>
     Except that [i] I actually _do_ change my mind quite readily, on a <br>
     'balance-sheet' evaluation of rival theories; although -- like your <br>
     father -- I value tenacity and original thinking;  and [ii] my <br>
     'restructuring' is in fact a continuation and extension of the <br>
     Euclid-Newton-Classical-Mechanics _mainline_, in the long tradition <br>
     of matter/forces/empty-space metaphysics.<br>
<p>
     Only the building-blocks of matter -- positrinos and and electrinos <br>
     --are all that 'new' (and they're owed to R.A. Waldron, Professor of <br>
     Mathematics, Ulster Polytechnic, 'The Spinning Photon', Speculations <br>
     in Science and Technology, Elsevier [1981]).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My father would get letters and phone calls from them periodically, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; occasional unwelcome visits.</i><br>
<p>
      Has it ever occurred to you that physics heretics (among whom your <br>
      your father is most certainly numbered!) are often a bit odd?  Why <br>
      would any 'normal' person bother with developing new theories? So <br>
      much easier to conform, and to use the pre-existing smelly little <br>
      orthodoxies...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Like you, they don't like Einstein.</i><br>
<p>
      Wrong!!!  I _do_ like Einstein as a personality and as a writer <br>
      (although I do think he was a bit of a charlatan: still, paid <br>
      physics jobs were hard to come by, back then).  Sure, I think some <br>
      his work is wrong (so did he).<br>
<p>
      And I do think that (along with Ernst Mach and many others) he <br>
      helped to attack the Kantian foundations of Western civilization <br>
      (probably quite deliberately, as he saw them as an obstacle to the <br>
      'scientific socialist' world order which many scientists 'bought <br>
      into' back then, with -- predictedly -- disastrous consequences).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Like you, they don't know much mathematics</i><br>
<p>
      Oh, c'mon!  You ever heard of Adam-Smithian division of labour?  If <br>
      I want a bean-counter, I _hire_ one.  Anyway, what the hell are <br>
      computers for?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but they do erect complex systems of important-sounding concepts.  Like </i><br>
<i>&gt; you, they argue indefatigably and according to rules unlike those used</i><br>
<i>&gt; by ordinary physicists, or, indeed, ordinary rational people.</i><br>
<p>
      A cheap attempted smear job, Carl.  Utterly unworthy of you...<br>
<p>
      I don't want to be an 'ordinary physicist.'  Neither did your <br>
      father.  We're _trail-blazers_.<br>
<p>
      You're probavbly motivated by my questioning your father's claims to <br>
      priority.  Right or wrong?  Answer, please.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Like you, they feel oppressed, abused and neglected by the world at </i><br>
<i>&gt; large.</i><br>
<p>
      Another cheap shot.  I experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, as <br>
      a direct result of combat in the Cold War and the fight for <br>
      individual rights. Nothing to do with my work in physics.  Don't <br>
      hand me your psychologistic crap, Carl.  Address the _critical <br>
      issues_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And it is generally impossible to change their mind, which certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems true of you so far.</i><br>
<p>
      Your father 'followed his star' with great intelligence and <br>
      determination, just as I follow mine.  We couldn't do what we do <br>
      without that tenacity and individuality.  "Dare yo use your own <br>
      intelligence!  This is the maxim of the Enlightenment!" -- Immanuel <br>
      Kant, 'Was ist Aufklarung?'<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; My father was careful to distinguish such people from genuine seekers </i><br>
<i>&gt; after knowledge; to the latter, he would provide careful replies to </i><br>
<i>&gt; their letters, and would spend considerable time on the phone with </i><br>
<i>&gt; them.  To the former, he would not reply, having learned from experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any attempt at correspondence generally results in an interminable</i><br>
<i>&gt; series of screeds of steadily increasing vituperation.</i><br>
<p>
      Let us all into the secret of the touchstone he used to distinguish <br>
      between the former and the latter.  I'm fairly sure I'd have gotten <br>
      on with your father famously well, going by his writings (he often <br>
      thinks a lot like me).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have followed this principle on this list, and hence have not replied </i><br>
<i>&gt; to any of your posts since you joined the list, no matter how obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; fallacious.    </i><br>
<p>
      Carl: feel free to be rude.  Or feel free to address the issues.  Or <br>
      not. That's what we're fighting for, in my business anyway.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are free to accuse me of closed-mindedness, rudeness, stupidity, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; adherence to any number of unsound philosophical practices.  I doubt I </i><br>
<i>&gt; will comment further on this matter.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
      I don't have to accuse you of _anything_.  You're convicting <br>
      yourself, by your own words.  Your present attitude would have been <br>
      regarded with hilarity by your father -- I can almost hear his hoots <br>
      of derision right now!  &gt;:-}   "Do some original work..."<br>
<p>

      Oh, and he was wrong on Challenger, too.<br>
<p>
      [ Read my -- true -- OMAC/Omega SpeedMaster ST-51 'Challenger' <br>
      story?  The astronauts often go out to the launch-pad early in the <br>
      morning, and _talk_ with the ships who sing.  Are we _all_ 'crazy', <br>
      perhaps? &gt;:-} ].<br>
<p>
<p>
      Carl, here's the deal:<br>
<p>
      Go rent Richard C. Sarafian's inspired movie "Vanishing Point" [1971].<br>
<p>
      Carefully watch the fate of another immortally beautiful white <br>
      Challenger, '... quick beyond all dreams of speed ...'<br>
<p>
      If yop're not moved and illuminated, just say, and I'll refund the <br>
      video rental price.  In solid gold.  I can't bring Challenger and <br>
      her crew back.  John Denver, who was selected to fly on the final <br>
      mission, was 'bounced' in favour of Christa McAuliffe, for expressly <br>
      political reasons -- Reagan's White House intervened.  John Denver <br>
      said that the disaster would not have occurred if he'd been on board <br>
      that day. He was absolutely right, of course.<br>
