From: Wayne Hayes &lt;wayne@cs.toronto.edu&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think Jefferson was talking about militaries, and neither</i><br>
<i>&gt;are the people in this thread.  The "armed" in this thread clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;refers to average citizens.  In that sense, the US citizenry is</i><br>
<i>&gt;far more heavily armed than any other (first-world) country I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;aware of.  Certainly there are plenty of people in Western Europe</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Canada with guns, but the percentage is far lower than in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;US, and the kinds of guns are generally different, too.  Fully</i><br>
<i>&gt;automatic weapons are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the</i><br>
<i>&gt;military), and I suspect the same is true for most of Western</i><br>
<i>&gt;Europe.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)</i><br>
<p>
Fully automatic weapons have been illegal to the average U.S.<br>
citizen since the 1930's.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hardly anybody in Canada (percentage-wise) owns a gun.  I can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;think of one person, in all the people I know personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;(including all the not-so-close acquantences of my family), who</i><br>
<i>&gt;owns a gun --- a pistol.  I used to have many friends who had</i><br>
<i>&gt;guns, but they were all people who were involved with the Canadian</i><br>
<i>&gt;military.  (I used to be in the the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was on the rifle team.  I was the top cadet marksman in southern</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ontario.  It was fun, and some day I may buy a rifle, but it's not</i><br>
<i>&gt;high on my priority list.  So, you see, I have nothing personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;against guns, I'm just arguing your facts here.)</i><br>
<p>
It must be a case of like attitudes, almost every Canadian I know<br>
owns a gun. ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;not to mention a rather large and extremely well armed neighbor</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to the south. If you think thats got nothing to do with it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you're only kidding yourself.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nothing to do with "it"?  What "it" are you refering to?</i><br>
<p>
The "it" I was refering to is that Canada has an easier time than<br>
most countries being "substantially unarmed" and free because it's<br>
next door neighbor is well armed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, as I said, since it is clear to me that there exist countries</i><br>
<i>&gt;today that are substantially unarmed and also free and peaceful,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is unclear that Jefferson's statement will be proved correct in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the long term.</i><br>
<p>
I haven't seen any proof of this, but I'm unlikely to convince you.<br>
<p>
Take care neighbor..... ;)<br>
<p>
