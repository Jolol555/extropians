I tend to agree, but it is ExI's list.  And the amount of spam has been, well<br>
not terribly high, more than I expected.  Also, moderating the list would be<br>
a full time job.  (Of course, it could be distributed.)<br>
<p>
I am, BTW, not a member of ExI, so when the list gets restricted I will be<br>
reduced to read=only status.:(<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One restriction I would like to see is allowing only list-members to post.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Restrictions beyond this may reduce the S/NR, but I don't think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduction noise will be worth the loss of perfectly good signals! ;)</i><br>
<p>
Well, a compromise might be to have an ExI member sponsor someone<br>
to be a participant.  Still, this will be restictive, but what does everyone<br>
think?<br>
