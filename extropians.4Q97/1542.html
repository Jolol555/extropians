Hi peoples, <br>
I was just wondering if uplifting is the same as uploading<br>
uploading to me seems to imply from human to human<br>
What you guys are saying here is putting human intelligence into<br>
more powerful albeit lower life forms ( get the best of both<br>
worlds? )<br>
Also how far have we gotten in this uplifting thing?<br>
Seems pretty scary thinking about it,...if God decides that we<br>
have gone to far and calls it quits on us .... : " Closing time ,<br>
gentlemen ...  !!! " heh heh<br>
Thanks for these interactions...<br>

Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your<br>
intelligent guard dogs would want pay and maybe form unions<br>
(packs?)..... One needn't uplift to the point of giving rights. <br>
That is another issue altogether.<br>
Yes, but we should realize we are taking on a big responsibility by<br>
even partial uplifting. There are plenty of people who think even<br>
normal animals can have certain rights, and an uplifted animal<br>
would likely have more rights.<br>
It mgiht be, though my first step would be anything to increase<br>
brain power in a meaningful way -- whether than be increasing<br>
speed or firing, changes in connections or adding more neurons /<br>
connections.<br>
There are no significant differences in firing speed, neural<br>
arborization and connectivity as far as I know between different<br>
mammals. However, a colleauge pointed out to me that primiates<br>
seems to have some very high-frequency cells that others lack<br>
that may be important. But in general relative cortical size and<br>
structure seems to be more important than the other properties.<br>
Surgery is one route, though I'd be more into breeding and<br>
controlling development hormonally and genetically.<br>
Genetics is probably the way to go, if only to add control genes so<br>
that we can make adult brains grow more or "debug" them, since we<br>
want the species to have a heritable intelligence. Hormones and<br>
surgery can only help individuals.<br>
Increasing the amount of effort and time to growing a larger brain<br>
in, say, octopi, might be a good start.  <br>
it may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so<br>
different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.<br>
I also believe intelligence to be best measured by problem<br>
solving abilities. Language would be a good way but not the only<br>
way to implement this measurement.  (There are nonlinguistic<br>
tests we can do to test uplifted organisms, such as some which<br>
are already done with mice.<br>
 Yes, but language is important in order to make the uplifted<br>
animals able to communicate with each other, and hence spread<br>
their own experiences and memes. It would likely accelerate<br>
development just as it appears to have done in humans.<br>
It strikes me that we really need to learn more about how we<br>
became intelligent in order to be good at uplifting. But<br>
uplifting also gives us valuable information on how we may have<br>
evolved.<br>
