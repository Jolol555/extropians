Hard to predict, but there is a lot of very promising work being done<br>
right now. We are getting better and better at understanding cell<br>
adhesion molecules, neurotrophic factors (which make axions grow in<br>
certain directions) and growth factors that make neurons thrive. At<br>
the same time there is plenty of work on neuron-chip interfaces,<br>
ranging from letting them grow on field effect transistors to having<br>
axons grow through holes in a silicon plate. The big problems to solve<br>
are 1) how to make these systems last in the body (rejection, tissue<br>
changes, neural wear and tear etc), 2) doing something useful with the<br>
signals and 3) get some volume into the connections (there are<br>
millions of axons in the spinal cord, and we need a sizeable fraction<br>
(around 10% or so) in order to restore function).<br>
<p>
My guess is indeed that by 2027 we should have the necessary know-how<br>
to do it (or at least know why it can't be done if we are unlucky). Of<br>
course, just because we can interface neurons with silicon doesn't<br>
mean we will immediately get cool brain-computer interfaces, that is<br>
much harder and is also influenced by trends in human-computer<br>
interaction, competition with other systems such as wearable computers<br>
and the big threshold of pain, expense, time and effort required to<br>
get an interface to work for you.<br>
