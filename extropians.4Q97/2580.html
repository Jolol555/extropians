In response to the survey I do not own a gun, rather I have chosen to live in an<br>
area where there is very little crime, so a firearm is pretty low on my priority<br>
list.  If I do at some point in the future choose to purchase a gun, then I will<br>
most certainly make a gun safety course a top priority. Personnally I understand<br>
where Kathryn Aegis' concern comes from but as cold as it may sound if someone <br>
is going to end up maimed or killed by a gun I would certainly prefer that it is<br>
the person aginast whom I might need to defend myself or loved ones from, rather<br>
than myself or loved ones.  Sometimes hard choices are required, in the meantime<br>
I hope that most of us choose to seek solutions to the sources of violence <br>
before resulting to it.<br>
