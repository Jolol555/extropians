Thanks for you feedback.  I find it facinating when intelligent people<br>
seem to have actual differing opinions that are not based in differences<br>
of belief in certain facts.  I have seen these arguments before, and I<br>
believe in all the same technical capabilities that you seem to<br>
describe, but my conslusion of personal choice would be different than<br>
yours.<br>
<p>
I have heard the idea of copying to avoid death many times, but it still<br>
seems to be a semantic smoke-and-mirrors trick where the copies is<br>
merely "labelled" the same as the original.  My experience is different<br>
between me and my copy.  I still experience the universe from the<br>
viewpoint of my original body.  The fact that a copy is made does not<br>
change my experience that I am still within this body.  Danger still<br>
scares this consciousness.  Pain still hurts this body.  And I continue<br>
to try to avoid the death my physical container.  My experiencial<br>
viewpoint does not magically transfer to the new copy like a mystical<br>
soul.  I still continue existing and experiencing withing the original<br>
body.  If you kill this original body, I will feel the pain, I will<br>
experience the loss of consciousness, and then I will stop experiencing<br>
anything at all.  Why would I allow that?  Just because a doppleganger<br>
that looks just like me says, "Trust me, I'll carry on in your place."?<br>
<p>
If I copy you perfectly, would you give up your freedom and become my<br>
slave, happy in the knowledge that "you" (your copy) is still free? <br>
Would you not try to avoid physical pain because it had been explained<br>
to you that "you" (your copy) still exists without pain?  Would you take<br>
a cut in pay as long as "you" (your copy) still received a full salary? <br>
Would you become celibate and nonjealous, happy in the knowledge that<br>
"you" (your copy) is now having a long-term sexual relationship with<br>
your spouse?  Is not death merely the ultimate inconvenience, permanent<br>
pain, or permanent lack of pleasure?  Would you really not mind being<br>
killed, just because you are assured that "you" (your copy) will be<br>
allowed to live?<br>
<p>
I see these examples as similar questions on a continuum.  I'm not sure<br>
why that last one would be any different than the former ones.  I still<br>
see the original as trying to avoid pain, gain pleasure, and avoid<br>
death.  Knowledge of what some other body is experiencing that I am not<br>
experiencing does not influence my desires for the future.<br>
<p>
Your other examples are all very good.  They all are different ways of<br>
expressing the same copying example, and they all have the same problem<br>
for me.  They require copying, the creation of a dupliate, and then the<br>
destruction of the original afterwards or simultaneously.  As long as I<br>
am still experiencing myself inside the original, about to suffer that<br>
destruction, I don't see the advantage in having some distant copy that<br>
I am merely told exists.<br>
