<i>&gt; &gt;Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intelligent guard dogs would want pay and maybe form unions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(packs?). I think unintelligent animals might do plenty of jobs better</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in many ways than intelligent animals; you other two arguments are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;IMHO more compelling reasons for uplifting than getting certain forms</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of labor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One needn't uplift to the point of giving rights.  That is another issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; altogether.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but we should realize we are taking on a big responsibility by<br>
even partial uplifting. There are plenty of people who think even<br>
normal animals can have certain rights, and an uplifted animal would<br>
likely have more rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It mgiht be, though my first step would be anything to increase brain power in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a meaningful way -- whether than be increasing speed or firing, changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; connections or adding more neurons/connections.</i><br>
<p>
There are no significant differences in firing speed, neural<br>
arborization and connectivity as far as I know between different<br>
mammals. However, a colleauge pointed out to me that primiates seems<br>
to have some very high-frequency cells that others lack that may be<br>
important. But in general relative cortical size and structure seems<br>
to be more important than the other properties.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surgery is one route, though I'd be more into breeding and controlling</i><br>
<i>&gt; development hormonally and genetically.</i><br>
<p>
Genetics is probably the way to go, if only to add control genes so<br>
that we can make adult brains grow more or "debug" them, since we want<br>
the species to have a heritable intelligence. Hormones and surgery can<br>
only help individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Increasing the amount of effort and time to growing a larger brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; in, say, octopi, might be a good start.  </i><br>
<p>
It may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so<br>
different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cheap too?</i><br>
<p>
Hardly. :-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I also believe intelligence to be best measured by problem solving abilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Language would be a good way but not the only way to implement this</i><br>
<i>&gt; measurement.  (There are nonlinguistic tests we can do to test uplifted</i><br>
<i>&gt; organisms, such as some which are already done with mice.:)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but language is important in order to make the uplifted animals<br>
able to communicate with each other, and hence spread their own<br>
experiences and memes. It would likely accelerate development just as<br>
it appears to have done in humans.<br>
<p>
It strikes me that we really need to learn more about how we became<br>
intelligent in order to be good at uplifting. But uplifting also gives<br>
us valuable information on how we may have evolved.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Play God!</i><br>
<p>
How else can we learn?<br>
