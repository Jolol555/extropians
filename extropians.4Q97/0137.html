Hi everyone,  Iv'e been subscribed to the list for a couple months but have<br>
not responded due to my limited scientific knowledge (thanks to you all for<br>
helping to grow that small kernel in my gray matter).<br>
<p>
I don't presume to speak for Geoff Smith nor do I think he needs me to<br>
defend him, but when Joao Pedro said &lt; Do you know that 30,000 children die<br>
each day of avoidable causes?&gt; I just had to respond:<br>
<p>
I am well aware of this and similar facts, and having traveled the world<br>
extensively  ( including communist nations ) I have noticed a correlation<br>
between needless suffering and death, and STATE control of the economy.<br>
i.e.  "Minister of Economy" = Death and Suffering<br>
