On Thu, 20 Nov 1997 19:28:50 -0500 Twink wrote about<br>
Mark Turner's THE LITERARY MIND:<br>
&lt; It looks to me, from reading the preface, that his<br>
theory can be subsumed under the notion that our<br>
minds function by trying to put things into causal<br>
chains.  In a sense, this subsumes  and explains the<br>
parable/story metaphor -- and can be true even if<br>
Turner's theory turns out not to be.  At the very<br>
least, the wider notion of causality underlies much<br>
of our understanding.  (Some would argue, and I would<br>
agree, that it is axiomatic, and that our knowing of<br>
it is merely a identification not of a fact about<br>
mind but about reality as such.) &gt;<br>
<p>
Our minds may TRY "to put things into causal chains"<br>
but I'm not sure that implies that "causality<br>
underlies much of our understanding".<br>
<p>
The following is from a Discover article that was<br>
available around the time that Damien Broderick first<br>
mentioned this book to the Extropians list:<br>
<p>
"Knowledge, in other words, comes from the sparks<br>
stories display as they strike up against each other.<br>
And since that's an inherently dynamic process,<br>
knowledge is also consequently unstable. 'Meaning,'<br>
Turner says, 'is a complex operation of projecting,<br>
blending, and integrating over multiple spaces.<br>
Meaning never settles down into a single residence.<br>
Meaning is parabolic and literary.'"<br>
<a href="http://www.enews.com/magazines/discover/magtxt/9703-7.html">http://www.enews.com/magazines/discover/magtxt/9703-7.html</a><br>
<p>
Now, this "sparks [of concepts] striking up against<br>
each other" may sound causal, but projecting,<br>
blending, and integrating at the level above this<br>
where we interpret and apply the allegories,<br>
metaphors and parables doesn't sound all that causal<br>
to me.<br>
<p>
It seems to me to be saying that human thought is<br>
based principally on pattern matching, an on-going<br>
variation and selection, feedback between many<br>
levels, where it is effectively impossible to<br>
untangle all the causal threads.  We may frequently<br>
jump to causal conclusions about events happening in<br>
our environment that work for practical purposes even<br>
though the causality really isn't there.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I haven't actually had a chance to read<br>
Turner's book, though I'd like to. It's interesting,<br>
however, to quote something about causality that was<br>
JUST posted to another list (psyche-D) where<br>
neuroscientist Walter Freeman wrote:<br>
<p>
&lt; I wish to challenge the assumption that the world<br>
is causal.  There are interrelations of objects and<br>
events in varying degrees of invariance, scope, and<br>
temporal order.  We humanize them by assigning<br>
'cause'.   I think I know how it is that we do this,<br>
through the neural processes of corollary discharge<br>
and reafference.  If this is valid, then causation<br>
holds in human actions, but it is misassigned to<br>
phenomena in the world, leading to the quandary<br>
described above. &gt;<br>
<p>
and Chris Malcolm, Department of Aritificial<br>
Intelligence, Edinburgh University, responded in<br>
agreement and went on to describe how:<br>
<p>
&lt; Cause is relative to the capabilities and purposes<br>
of the observer. Cause is an observer-related<br>
abstraction from the matrix of conditions which<br>
underlie the existence of something. [CUT] Consider<br>
for example an instruction in a computer program to<br>
"beep" (make a beeping noise). [CUT] It is immaterial<br>
in the same way as a melody, the rules of chess, a<br>
plan, or an idea. Yet we all agree that what just<br>
caused the computer to beep was the beep command in<br>
the program it was running. Wait a minute! It<br>
*wasn't* the instruction in the program that caused<br>
it, it *was* the configuration of voltages across<br>
transistor junctions. But they are the same thing! No<br>
they're not!<br>
<p>
That's the sort of trap you fall into when you<br>
stretch "cause" too far. We know exactly what is<br>
meant by an immaterial computer program causing a<br>
physical action. There is no magic, no need for some<br>
special ontologically distinct realm where<br>
information and ideas reside which has some<br>
specialised kind of causal connection to the normally<br>
causally closed world of physics. The Cartesian<br>
mind-matter duality is an artefact of mistaking the<br>
nature of causality, a misdiagnosis of what the<br>
problem is when causality falls to bits when you try<br>
to use it to explain how software affects hardware<br>
and how ideas affect men. &gt;<br>
