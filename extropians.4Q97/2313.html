I just gotta point out one detail that I suspect is a minor error:<br>

You're implying that you aren't factoring in the energy cost of the <br>
refining and transportation of gasoline.<br>
<p>
Three times 18% is 54%.  You're saying that the complete power cycle <br>
of an electric car is three times as efficient as the internal power <br>
cycle of a standard IC engine car, or 54% efficient.  However, you <br>
also say that the internal power cycle of an electric car is only 45% <br>
efficient.  This implies that the efficiency of the electric power <br>
plant, transmission system, and battery charging system (or <br>
equivalent) is rather in excess of 100%.<br>
