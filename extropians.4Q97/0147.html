<i>&gt; Question:  How would the economy function in an uploaded society?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Answer:  First you need a product, and that product is you.  After having</i><br>
<i>&gt; your wetware converted into a new infinitely variable cut-and-paste</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness you're ready to start production.  You're not in control of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your production, but everyone else is.  Instead you manage the marketing</i><br>
<i>&gt; side, you've got to sell the product.  Why would anyone want to buy you?</i><br>
<p>
I assume you haven't yet read Robin Hanson's essay (If Uploads Come First,<br>
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/hanson_uploads.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/hanson_uploads.html</a>) about upload <br>
economy? He seems to reach the same conclusion as you. <br>
<p>
However, there are a lot of other things that can be traded: virtual<br>
environments of differing complexity and uniqueness, access to the physical<br>
world, knowledge and experiences. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  They don't, they reproduce you.  Maybe you've got a great sense of humour, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; brilliant understanding of quantum theory or you're just easy.  Whatever the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason, I like you and I want a copy.  So I either copy the parts of you I</i><br>
<i>&gt; like into a new individual, or I cut and paste them into myself.  Well done,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you've just reproduced.</i><br>
<p>
This is where you diverge from Hanson; he assumes uploads are essentially<br>
indivisible since they are complex, interconnected structures with no<br>
clear modularity - my sense of humour exists as an emergent property<br>
of my whole neural net, which makes it hard to copy. I would say this is<br>
the likely state in the beginning, but as soon as we begin to learn how<br>
to reverse-engineer our minds, then things can get interesting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The more you reproduce, the safer you are.  Reproduction has always been the</i><br>
<i>&gt; main priority in the biological world and the same can be said of the upload</i><br>
<i>&gt; world.  But rather than passing your genes along, you're passing along your</i><br>
<i>&gt; memes.  And the more your mind sprawls into every corner of the memesphere,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the safer you are and the more computation you're getting done.  But if it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to copy consciousness, why not just copy yourself?  Everyone will,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they'll keep copying themselves repeatedly and you'll have not distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantage over anyone else.  But what if you marketed yourself so well, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; also copied you?  Now you have an advantage.</i><br>
<p>
Now you know why I want to become an open standard for information<br>
gathering and organisation... :-)<br>
