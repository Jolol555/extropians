<i>&gt; Bit yes ambiguous no. Unless the holly rollers turn out to be right the human </i><br>
<i>&gt; brain must be equivalent to a Turing machine and the human mind equivalent to </i><br>
<i>&gt; what a Turing machine does. What a Turing machine does is determined by the </i><br>
<i>&gt; state it's in, and that depends on whether it sees a 0 or a 1 on a paper tape. </i><br>
<i>&gt; How could anything be less ambiguous than that? </i><br>
<p>
If the fundamental laws of physics turn out to be computable, then in <br>
some sense *everything* must be equivalent to a Turing machine; this <br>
would not mean, however, that there were no ambiguous terms. In <br>
particular, there may be multiple correct ways of modelling the human <br>
psyche on Turing machines, depending, e.g., on what level of <br>
abstraction we assume.<br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;I think the traditional line of thinking goes like this: The thought         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Mary loves John." involves the same concepts as "John loves Mary.",         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;namely the concepts "John", "loves" and "Mary". Nevertheless the two        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;thoughts are quite distinct. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                                </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're using the word "concept" in a somewhat more restrictive manner than I </i><br>
<i>&gt; was, but that's OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;rather than saying that you are a collection of concepts, you have         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;to say that you are a collection of conceps cum a structure defined         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;on that collection. </i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I use your implied definition of "concept" then I certainly agree.</i><br>
<p>
Now, the point is that only according to this sense of "concept" <br>
could they be said to be verbs, nouns, adjectives etc., as required <br>
by your previous assertion that you are an adjective. If by "concept" <br>
you meant "propositional thought", then if you were a collection of <br>
such "concepts" you could obviously not be (a collection) of <br>
adjectives!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;And I don't think it makes literal sense to say that this collection         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;cum structure is an adjective -- it would be more correct to say         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that it was a proposition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps, but the important point is that it's not a noun.</i><br>
<p>
The point that it is not a noun is no more important than the point <br>
that it is not an adjective or verb.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Moreover, in order to be a human being, it is not enough to be a         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;person. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True but unimportant. The important part is the person, a human being is just </i><br>
<i>&gt; a bag of protoplasm.</i><br>
<p>
I was just noting that if we want to define what a human is it is <br>
not enough to define what a person is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;One also has to belong to the human species, and whether one does so         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;presumably depends on one's ancestry and one's biological         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;constitution, not just on one's thoughts or concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's so great about belonging to the human species? A human being is an  </i><br>
<i>&gt; animal so of course it must be biological, but the same is not true of a </i><br>
<i>&gt; person.</i><br>
<p>
You misunderstand me. My point was the same as the one you are <br>
making, namely that it is possible to be a person without being <br>
human. I wasn't saying anything about what's great and what isn't.<br>
