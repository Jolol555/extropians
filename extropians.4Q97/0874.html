In a message dated 97-10-27 03:25:54 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Good filters. :) There's also the seeming paradox that the most activity<br>
 comes from the people with the most time to spare, not the people who<br>
 send a few high-Q posts, such as (to name three) Eric Watt Forste, Steve<br>
 Witham, and Robin H.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Do you guys do your research and homework</i><br>
<i> &gt; before publishing stuff like that ?</i><br>
 <br>
 Some do, some don't. It's an open list, not a closed club. Consequently<br>
 the SNRR is kind of, umm, well, mediocre or worse at times. Some good<br>
 people get dragged into time-wasting arguments around here. Consequently<br>
 *they* aren't perceived to be shining at their true luminosity, either.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Does your writings contribute to the</i><br>
<i> &gt; extropian ideals, and thus creating a</i><br>
<i> &gt; better world for prospective post-humans ?</i><br>
 <br>
 Ouch. I'm guilty, I'm trying to not fall for every troll, but it's hard,<br>
 and I need more practice.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Please feedback to me ASAP</i><br>
<i> &gt; before further disillusionments sets</i><br>
 <br>
 Hey, if you feel you have to tar every member of the list because there<br>
 are some bozos, go ahead, but please recognize that's what you're doing.<br>
 OK? :)Suggestions have been made for several ways to improve the SNRR,<br>
 but nothing has been done, because the list is run by King Log, not King<br>
 Stork. I dislike it, too. I'm getting better filters. And I don't like<br>
 having to.<br>

Well...it's like this Dr Frankenstien....hairy earred peasants such as<br>
myself....mudd all over our feet...can either read and ask "low signal, hi<br>
noise" questions of etemeed and erudite people such as yourself on venue's<br>
such as this...<br>
<p>
Or listen to  Cranktite.. Wah-wah. and LockJaw.....read the Weekly World<br>
News...National Enquierer...and the Star<br>
 <br>
And perhaps...from attitudes and opinions thus developed....  sometime in the<br>
future....armed with crucifixes, pitchforks. and righteous<br>
indignation.....storm your (ivory) castle during the dark of nite...burn!<br>
Transhuman....burn!!!!<br>
