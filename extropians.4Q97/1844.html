<i>&gt;&gt;  If I have a robot that feeds me grapes, why would I want</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;to suddenly go out and kill some backwards religious person that </i><br>
fears<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;technology?  It's absurd to think there would be a reason for such</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;right?</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Of course killing them is not the solution and would never be an </i><br>
admitted<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;behaviour in an evoluted world. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;But a solution sometimes is necessary since such religious people</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;generally get politically organized and simply say (and may even "win" </i><br>
at<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the end) that your robot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; or human cloning, or anything else are "things of the devil"...and </i><br>
"against<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;god's wish" ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Cause of such behaviour they are not so pretty good boys/girls...and </i><br>
we<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;always must have a more intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(and stronger) response for them.</i><br>

Yes religious fanatics or anti technologists are a danger.  But as a <br>
superior intelligence or evolved being one should only pacify threats to <br>
our freedom, not  kill off whole peoples since there ideologies are <br>
directly against ours.  Diversity must be preserved.  If we are talking <br>
about what technology on a scale that nanotechnology will bring us, then <br>
there should be room for all kinds of man to live on one planet let <br>
alone the universe.  For example the quakers are fine,  in many ways <br>
educational to the way we once lived.  Thats the way I see it if others <br>
does not desire to join us in evolving to the next level.  Then we <br>
should leave a world for them to exist on.  With our technological might <br>
we do not have kill them off, or assimilate them.  Just declaw them and <br>
leave them be.  The threat is always high that one of these mundanes <br>
might kill us all.  We must always take them seriously, have safe guards <br>
in place, and be one step ahead of them.  If we are so intellectually <br>
superior, than we should be able to do this<br>
