	How many abstract bits of information would it take to store<br>
the various possible responses to the question: "What is salty?"  in a<br>
discussion kind of way?  Wouldn't an abstract machine producing such<br>
responses really be a liar since it really had no idea what salty was<br>
phenomenally like?<br>
<p>
	How many bits do you think the brain uses to reproduce such<br>
"information"?  Or does it simply know what salty is like?  And might<br>
such phenomenal abilities to "instantiate information" be one reason<br>
for such "common sense" intelligence that abstract machines still<br>
lack?<br>
<p>
	Wouldn't an honest and intelligent abstract machine be able to<br>
recognize that it doesn't really know what salty is like, just as you<br>
must admit that you don't know what salty is like for me, unless salty<br>
is the same for me as it is for you?<br>
"<br>
<p>
I believe that your approach to this issue results from your view of<br>
perception, and communication.  You have taken a top down approach to<br>
the problem of abstract sensations - "I know what salty is, even if I<br>
can't explain it" - and seem to be implying that an A.I. should start<br>
with this idea about what salty is, before it trys to experience.  It<br>
would seem to me that this problem requires a bottom up approach -<br>
surely humans new how to taste salt before they could express this in<br>
words?<br>
<p>
So let it be for A.I.s.  Using an electronic nose, or some other such<br>
contrivance, they will have their own experience of the taste of salt -<br>
based on the feedback they get from their input device.  This experience<br>
of the taste of salt will be no less valid to them as our experiences<br>
are to us.  You have made a good point though - that an A.I. would not<br>
be able to compare it's experience to that of a non-A.I.<br>
<p>
On the subject of the copy paradox in general, specifically the<br>
difference between the original and the copy:<br>
<p>
Surely at the point of creation - the instant of copying - and assuming<br>
the copying is exact - the original and the copy are indistinguishable.<br>
The copy "is" the original to all intents and purposes.  A copying<br>
process which is not exact, or one in which the copy has a different<br>
experience of the copying process to the original, is not valid for this<br>
thought experiment.<br>
<p>
For another view of this subject, I recommend the first part of the<br>
short story "Dust" by Greg Egan.<br>
