I've got a problem here...<br>
<p>
You see...a friend of mine's dad is dying...of cancer.<br>
<p>
I've been in a similar situation...twice...Mother and Mother-in-Law.  They<br>
both died of terminal illnesses.<br>
<p>
My problem is this.  In all these cases there came a point where the doctors<br>
"ditched" them...and gave them over to the care of a Hospice.  I have nothing<br>
against hospice (s)...I think they do a fine job...and I support them both<br>
philosophically and $$$$$$.  What I'm having trouble with is the hue and cry<br>
against euthanisa.  If a person is in a hospice...they've already given up on<br>
him getting well...he's terminal and nothing else is being done to make the<br>
situation better....he's "as good as dead" as far as the medical, legal...etc<br>
are concerned.<br>
<p>
Some of these illnesses in the final stages are very painful...agonizing in<br>
fact.  So they give the patient morphine...my mother was taking HUGE amounts<br>
in the last days.<br>
<p>
My friend's Dad has been "gone" for about a week now...mentally....he's not<br>
conscious.    It's just his body struggling on...and on....and on....<br>
<p>
The watching...the waiting... the final days is hard on a family. The<br>
"patient" might not be suffering due to being doped to the eyeballs with<br>
drugs...but the family certainly suffers... I'm finding it hard to equate what<br>
I've witnessed with "dying with dignity".  <br>
<p>
It would seem to me that what we are now doing is the "moral equivalent" to<br>
euthanisa as far as the dying person is concerned...yet vastly more harmful to<br>
the survivors....<br>
<p>
....any thoughts on this?<br>
<p>
