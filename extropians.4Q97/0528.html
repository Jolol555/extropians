Sounds pretty Utopian to me.  How do you know that an oppressive<br>
government in some form will not exist post-singularity?  We could<br>
probably maintain an anarchy now, but we don't.  How can you be so sure<br>
this is going to change?  Are superintelligences by nature libertarian?<br>
IMO, that would be an arrogant assumption on the part of<br>
anarcho-capitalists/libertarians.<br>
<p>
Here's a scenario:  A huge eastern-mystic-based cult forms.  They are<br>
pantheists, and of the belief that all is one, they are one of the whole,<br>
etc...  Using the money they get from selling flowers at the airport, they<br>
transcend and become powers. They aren't very smart compared to your average<br>
Joe, but since they believe all is one, and there are so many of them,<br>
they all lump together to form one big *super-power*  This super-power of<br>
neo-buddhists has more oppressive ability than all the governments in the<br>
world combined.  They have only one goal: to *make* you become part of the<br>
whole so the whole can perform some grand-scale meditation and become one<br>
with the universe-- something like Hari Krishna Borgs.  Say goodbye to<br>
individualism: you have no choice.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm not claiming I can predict what post-singularity will be like<br>
(which is obviously futile)  On the contrary, I am trying to show that we<br>
cannot rule out *any* possibility.  The only preparation for an uncertain<br>
future is in the attempt to create the future.  Creating the future<br>
involves enacting change in the present.  If we don't start now, things<br>
might get ugly.  Betting the problems of politics will be solved by the<br>
singularity is not a risk I'm willing to take.<br>
<p>
Enough pontificating.  Just my two cents,<br>
<p>
