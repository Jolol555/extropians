<i>&gt; Whoa.  If we use "we do not have a full understanding of the laws of</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics" as a rationale, then the substrate of an AI is equally suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt; of being a non-formal system.</i><br>
<p>
Not really.  The point is, we don't know how neurons work.  We don't know<br>
what aspects of their function are important.  Conceivably even unknown<br>
subatomic quantum details could affect their gross macroscopic behavior.<br>
This is not true of computers.  They are designed to have known principles<br>
of operation, to work in a strictly defined, algorithmic way.  Like any<br>
machine, they may be imperfect, but their imperfections are not fundamental<br>
to their operations, rather the designers do their best to avoid them.<br>
An AI which runs on a computer has a well understood, formal, algorithmic<br>
system at its base.  A mind running in a brain does not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Penrose's argument strikes me as exceedingly disengenious.  It is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interconnections between neurons (rather than the neurons themselves)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that result in the emergent information processing power of the brain.</i><br>
<p>
This is one theory, but it is not known what the truth is.  Neurons are<br>
generally considered relatively simplistic nonlinear summation devices,<br>
but there could be more going on than we are aware of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those interconnections operate via molecular-level signaling, not QM.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At some level quantum uncertainty affects everything, including a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "deterministic" AI substrate.  But for all practical purposes, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer is a formal system, even if quantum fluctuations will cause it</i><br>
<i>&gt; to flip a memory bit every few thousand years.  Does Penrose present any</i><br>
<i>&gt; compelling reason to think of the brain differently?</i><br>
<p>
"Compelling," no.  However he suggests some possibilities which can't<br>
be ruled out.  You have to assume (I think) that neurons carry more<br>
of the burden of computing than in conventional theories.  Within the<br>
neurons there may be quantum systems which manage to stay coherent.<br>
Some people point to the insides of microtubules as an area protected from<br>
the environment; others suggest that water molecules near surfaces may<br>
have a quasi-solid structure which could support quantum superpositions.<br>
<p>
It's all quite speculative, especially combined with Penrose's theories<br>
about quantum gravity solving the measurement problem.  Nobody would<br>
pay it much attention except that Penrose's Godelian argument seems to<br>
be surprisingly well accepted (as is Searle's Chinese Room argument).<br>
If you accept either of these, you have to either believe in zombies<br>
(beings which act conscious but aren't), or else you have to find some<br>
unknown physics which allows brains to behave non-algorithmically (I<br>
would say magically).<br>
