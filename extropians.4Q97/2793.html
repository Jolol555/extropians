Hi!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Jack, a COBOL programmer, after years of being taken for</i><br>
<i>&gt;granted and treated as a technological dinosaur by all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;UNIX programmers and Client/Server programmers and website</i><br>
<i>&gt;developers, finally started getting some respect in 1994.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He'd become a private consultant specializing in Year 2000</i><br>
<i>&gt;conversions. He was working</i><br>
<i>&gt;short-term assignments for prestige companies, traveling all</i><br>
<i>&gt;over the world on different assignments. He was working 70</i><br>
<i>&gt;and 80 and even 90 hour weeks, but it was worth it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;After a few years of this relentless, mind-numbing work,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jack started having problems sleeping and began having</i><br>
<i>&gt;anxiety dreams about the Year 2000. It had reached a point</i><br>
<i>&gt;where even the thought of the year 2000 made him nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;violent. He must have suffered some sort of breakdown,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because all he could think about was finding a way he could</i><br>
<i>&gt;avoid the year 2000 and all that came with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jack made a deal with a company that specialized in</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryogenics to have himself frozen until March 15th, 2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This was a very expensive process and totally automated. He</i><br>
<i>&gt;was thrilled. The next thing he would know is he'd wake up</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the year 2000; after the New Year celebrations and</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer debacles; after the leap day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing else to worry about except getting on with his life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians</i><br>
<i>&gt;set the revive date, he was given injections to slow his</i><br>
<i>&gt;heartbeat to a bare minimum, and that was that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very modern</i><br>
<i>&gt;room filled with excited people. They were all shouting "I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't believe it!" and "It's a miracle" and "He's alive!".</i><br>
<i>&gt;There were cameras (unlike any he'd ever seen) and equipment</i><br>
<i>&gt;that looked like it came out of a science fiction movie.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group</i><br>
<i>&gt;stepped forward. Jack couldn't contain his enthusiasm. "Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;it over?" he asked. "Is 2000 already here? Are all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;millennial parties and promotions and crises all over and</i><br>
<i>&gt;done with?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The spokesman explained that there had been a problem with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the programming of the timer on Jack's cryogenic</i><br>
<i>&gt;receptacle:  it hadn't been year 2000 compliant. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually eight thousand years later, not the year 2000. But</i><br>
<i>&gt;the spokesman told Jack that he shouldn't get excited;</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone important wanted to speak to him.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A wall-sized projection screen displayed the image of a man</i><br>
<i>&gt;that looked very much like Bill Gates. This man was Prime</i><br>
<i>&gt;Minister of Earth. He told Jack not to be upset. That this</i><br>
<i>&gt;was a wonderful time to be alive. That there was world peace</i><br>
<i>&gt;and no more starvation. That the space program had been</i><br>
<i>&gt;reinstated and there were colonies on the moon and on Mars.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That technology had advanced to such a degree that everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;had virtual reality interfaces which allowed them to contact</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone else on the planet, or to watch any entertainment, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;to hear any music recorded anywhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That sounds terrific," said Jack. "But I'm curious. Why is</i><br>
<i>&gt;everybody so interested in me?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Well," said the Prime Minister. "The year 10000 is just</i><br>
<i>&gt;around the corner, and it says in your files that you know</i><br>
<i>&gt;COBOL."</i><br>
<p>
