I haven't read it for a while, but Dennett made a case in 'Consciousness<br>
Explained' that red is not a physical phenomenon but merely a tag which<br>
we attach to certain stimuli. This seems to match my own experiences; I<br>
remember an optics lecture at school where the lecturer shone a light on<br>
a board of colored squares, and the center square was red. Only when he<br>
switched off the light did we realise that he was shining a non-red light<br>
on a non-red square, and there wasn't a single photon of 'red light' <br>
reaching our eyes. So something else had confused our brains into <br>
sticking a 'red' tag on that square, even though it had received no<br>
supporting data from the retina.<br>
<p>
Most people seem to believe that they know how their brains work, but<br>
most people haven't seen what happens when their brains go wrong, which<br>
is where the real data on brain operation lies.<br>
