OK, we need to be far more careful about the use of the term "state".<br>
It's being thrown around haphazardly without being defined sufficiently<br>
carefully.  Obviously, if by "state" you mean everything there is to<br>
know about the particle --- it's energy, momentum, position,<br>
temperature, the chemical bonds it's participating in, vibrational<br>
frequency, spin, etc, then obviously the state is crucial.  However,<br>
there are classical (Newtonian) elements of the state, and Quantum<br>
elements of the state.  Things like the spin are describable *only* by<br>
Quantum Mechanics, and have no meaning in classical physics.  It is<br>
these kinds of states, describable *only* by QM, that Quantum<br>
Teleportation is capable of duplicating.  *None* of the other kinds of<br>
states are.  Quantum teleportation does not duplicate momentum.  It<br>
doesn't duplicate energy.  It doesn't duplicate temperature.  And most<br>
importantly, it does not, and *is not capable of*, creating chemical<br>
bonds amongst previously unattached atoms at the receiving end in order<br>
to duplicate a molecule at the transmitting end.  A chemical reaction<br>
requires *energy* (among other things), and quantum teleportation does<br>
not transmit energy (as Erik correctly points out), it only transmits<br>
information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, the raw materials must</i><br>
<i>&gt;exist on the other end in order to do the recreation.  If you are going to</i><br>
<i>&gt;transport the state of a gold atom from point A to point B, you must have</i><br>
<i>&gt;a gold atom at point B in order to have the state transferred.</i><br>
<p>
Correct.  Even more important, if you want to transport the state of an<br>
NH4 molecule from point A to point B, then you must have an NH4 molecule at<br>
point B in order to have the state transfered.  It is NOT suficient to<br>
have one unattached N and four unattached H molecules at point B.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The state of the particles creates the larger object.</i><br>
<p>
Only, as I said, if "state" includes the classical components of state,<br>
which are *not* duplicated by quantum teleportation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They believe that they'll be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;transport molecules within 10 years with this method; in that case, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't need the molecule at point B, all you'll need is the raw materials of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the molecule to have it recreated.</i><br>
<p>
Incorrect.  They believe that in 10 years they will be able to transport<br>
the quantum state of molecules from point A to point B, but the molecules<br>
must already exist, as identical molecules, in all their spledour of<br>
chemical bonds, at point B.  Again, you need *energy* to create a molecule<br>
from constituent atoms, and quantum teleportation does not provide that<br>
energy.<br>
