<i>&gt;  &gt; Answer:  First you need a product, and that product is you.  After</i><br>
having<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; your wetware converted into a new infinitely variable cut-and-paste</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; consciousness you're ready to start production.  You're not in control</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; your production, but everyone else is.  Instead you manage the marketing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; side, you've got to sell the product.  Why would anyone want to buy you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I assume you haven't yet read Robin Hanson's essay (If Uploads Come First,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/hanson_uploads.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/hanson_uploads.html</a>) about upload</i><br>

<i>&gt;  economy? He seems to reach the same conclusion as you. </i><br>
<p>
And here's me thinking I'm original.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  However, there are a lot of other things that can be traded: virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt;  environments of differing complexity and uniqueness, access to the</i><br>
physical<br>
<i>&gt;  world, knowledge and experiences. </i><br>
<p>
None of which are directly beneficial to you (unless someone agreed to copy<br>
you in return, although knowledge and experience may be a mild form of<br>
copying)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;  They don't, they reproduce you.  Maybe you've got a great sense of</i><br>
humour, a<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; brilliant understanding of quantum theory or you're just easy.  Whatever</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; reason, I like you and I want a copy.  So I either copy the parts of you</i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; like into a new individual, or I cut and paste them into myself.  Well</i><br>
done,<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; you've just reproduced.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  This is where you diverge from Hanson; he assumes uploads are essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;  indivisible since they are complex, interconnected structures with no</i><br>
<i>&gt;  clear modularity - my sense of humour exists as an emergent property</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of my whole neural net, which makes it hard to copy. I would say this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the likely state in the beginning, but as soon as we begin to learn how</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to reverse-engineer our minds, then things can get interesting.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, the first thing I'm aiming for is scalability and modularity.<br>
 Otherwise the AIs will have me for dinner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The more you reproduce, the safer you are.  Reproduction has always been</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; main priority in the biological world and the same can be said of the</i><br>
upload<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; world.  But rather than passing your genes along, you're passing along</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; memes.  And the more your mind sprawls into every corner of the</i><br>
memesphere,<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; the safer you are and the more computation you're getting done.  But if</i><br>
it's<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; possible to copy consciousness, why not just copy yourself?  Everyone</i><br>
will,<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; they'll keep copying themselves repeatedly and you'll have not distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; advantage over anyone else.  But what if you marketed yourself so well,</i><br>
they<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; also copied you?  Now you have an advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Now you know why I want to become an open standard for information</i><br>
<i>&gt;  gathering and organisation... :-)</i><br>
<p>
Better start submitting yourself to the ISO.<br>
<p>
~WaX<br>
<p>
P.S.  If a qubit can store more than one value by using parallel universes,<br>
where do the parallel universes store their numbers?? :-)<br>
