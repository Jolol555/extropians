	While I have no idea on whether the universe is infinitely large or not, <br>
an answer to this "paradox" seems a bit obvious.  Imagine you have a star, <br>
and a senser right next to it.  You would be reading a great deal of energy <br>
from the sensor.  Now, move the sensor several light years away.  You would <br>
read a great deal less energy, since most of the energy from the star would <br>
be radiating away from the sensor.  Basically, all that energy from an <br>
infinite amount of stars would be radiating away into an infinte amount of <br>
space.  That's why our skies would be dark in an infinite universe.  As for <br>
the heating up part, &lt;excuse me while I violate Occam's Razor (sp?)&gt; there <br>
could be energy abosrbing objects that create mass . . . or, the universe <br>
can't create enough energy to fill an infinitely large void . . .<br>
<p>
	I wonder if there is anyway to show that the universe is infinitely large. <br>
 Start counting stars? &lt;grin&gt;<br>
