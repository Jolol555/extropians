<p>
Fun idea, but likely not workable since the air thins out more and<br>
more as height increases. This means that the buoyancy gets smaller<br>
and smaller for each ball, until the weight of the cable and balls<br>
would counteract the upward force. I think even diamond balls filled<br>
with vacuum would be too heavy beyond a certain height. And since you<br>
want to reach space rather than the high atmosphere, this is likely<br>
not enough (still, there are many uses for this kind of ultra-high<br>
altitude tower for (say) communications).<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; A pipe of 100 KM, isn't a problem to build, is it ?</i><br>
<p>
A 100 km pipe *upwards* would likely have a rather extreme pressure at<br>
the bottom - you would have a 100km liquid column at the bottom, which<br>
likely will overcome even nanodesigned materials.<br>
<p>
A more reasonable approach would be the classic beanstalk hanging down<br>
from an asteroid outside the synchrnonous orbit. That seems to be<br>
possible using nanomaterials, and would reach into space quite a bit.<br>
