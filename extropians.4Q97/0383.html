<i>&gt;  ridiculous at time t+n.</i><br>
<p>
How about we create an FAQ that's sent when you first subscribe that briefly<br>
answers those 'basic' questions we all find so annoying.  Split the FAQ into<br>
sections that also tell you the correct classifier for each topic, followed<br>
by a short description and then a list command that allows you to request a<br>
more comprehesive FAQ on that topic.  We could do the same for various papers<br>
(extropian principles, dynamic optimism, etc.)  That way anyone who reads it<br>
will know that the information is there, and if they still post basic<br>
questions, we can just point them in the direction of the correct FAQ.  We<br>
can let list members decide on what to put in these FAQs (when a basic<br>
consensus is reach on that subject and we want to move on) and also what<br>
classifiers to use.  Not only will this help both new and current members,<br>
but we'll be building a comprehensive database of ideas in the process.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I know, I know--one miracle at a time.</i><br>
<p>
Well if they get through all this and still post off-messages, it's probably<br>
a good idea to just ignore them.<br>
