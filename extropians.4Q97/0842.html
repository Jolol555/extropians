In a message dated 97-10-27 03:46:36 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;Ok, thats interesting, do you know of the relationship between the inner<br>
 core<br>
<i> &gt;and the outer core?</i><br>
 <br>
 The inner core is a solid apparently because of the enormous pressure it's<br>
 under.  It's made of the same stuff as the outer core.  Exact details of the<br>
 inner core structure aren't entirely clear because the pressures and <br>
 temperatures exceed our current experimental limits.  I believe the current<br>
 theory is that the inner core is an iron crystal, which you just can't<br>
 get under conditions at the surface.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Thats interesting, then perhaps its the inner/outer core process that is<br>
making the expansion?  I heard somewhere that we've created temperatures 3<br>
times hotter than that of the inner sun, in fusion reactors, is that bogus?<br>
 Anyway, Ive known about the crystal being in the center, thats really cool,<br>
im sure it has all sorts of implications/potentials, having effects on<br>
different wave/frequency/magnetic spectrums etc...<br>
<p>
do you know of a url on this where theories are being made etc..?<br>
<p>
thanks<br>
