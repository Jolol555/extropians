English speakers, as sloppy as they often are, are wed to precision.<br>
To wit:<br>
<p>
Complete sentences in English have a subject, a verb, and (generally)<br>
a predicate -- implied if not spoken.  Perhaps a language in which this<br>
was not true would be difficult for us (I, strangely enough, can't think<br>
of one off the top of my head).<br>
<p>
How about a language with no representations of past, present, and future?<br>
<p>
Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,<br>
imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?<br>
<p>
That said, I think that English speakers are among the least constrained<br>
on the planet, since we steal words from so many different languages.<br>
We do, however, seem to have problems with melodic and clicking<br>
languages.<br>
