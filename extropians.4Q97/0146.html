<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, but it still works doesnt it?</i><br>
<p>
As I tried to explain, it doesn't. He isn't Bill Gates 3, he's Bill<br>
Gates the Third, abbreviated as III, which if you count as i's, do not<br>
allow the sum of 666 for his whole name in ascii, so its merely<br>
anti-Bill propaganda and not even true numerology, even if someone were<br>
stupid enough to ascribe any credibility to neumerology in the first<br>
place.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Instead of translating the 3 into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number 3 represents, they just left it as 3.</i><br>
<p>
If that were true, then it should be counted as "3rd", NOT "3", so the<br>
numerology is also false there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Everything else is fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  What do you think about the Pope's number?</i><br>
<p>
Listen I could go on for hours on all sorts of numrological<br>
coincidences, like the fact that Pope John XXIII who guided the vatican<br>
through Vatican II was known as The Navigator before Vatican II, that<br>
the head of the Priory of Sion in Switzerland, credited by many to be<br>
the spiritual head of freemasonry, who was elected at the same time as<br>
that Pope, also went by the name of John The Navigator, and was the 23rd<br>
head of Sion to assum the name John. Blah Blah Blah.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And what does TAANSTAFL mean?</i><br>
<p>
For the umpteenth time on this list, it means: There Ain't No Such Thing<br>
As A Free Lunch, as anyone who has ever read a Heinlein novel could tell<br>
you.<br>
