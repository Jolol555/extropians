<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the Singularity back then.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Going from memory (books lent out):</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Vernor Vinge gave birth to the concept in 1979.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The first calculation with respect to human-equivalent AI was performed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hans Moravec and gave a result of 2035.  I believe this was 1980 or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thereabouts, although it could be 1984.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some people trace the Singularity concept to Vinge's story "Bookworm,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Run".  This was published in 1966 and predicted intelligence enhancement</i><br>
<i>&gt; in 1984 (according to the notes published with the story in True Names).</i><br>
<i>&gt; The story ends with the expection of a transformed world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hans Moravec's Mind Children was published in 1988.  He predicts that</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing power capable of human-level AI "would be available in a $10</i><br>
<i>&gt; million supercomputer before 2010 and in a $1,000 personal computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; by 2030."  This would range from 22 to 42 years away.</i><br>
<p>
So ELiezer projecting 2008 is not so far off, at least for the first<br>
steps. Market penetration would still take time, though I'd expect lab<br>
models to reach market competetiveness within a decade at that point,<br>
simply because of the added capabilities laboratory human level  AI<br>
would give to accellerating Moore's rate even more.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; could occur in that time frame.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yeah, but that was wild optimism, not an extrapolation based on previous rates</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you plotted such things as the fastest a human had ever gone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or the highest a human had ever gone, you would undoubtedly have</i><br>
<i>&gt; people at Jupiter by 2000 if you extrapolate that curve from ca 1970.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gregory Sullivan wrote here here last December about predictions by G.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Harry Stine in 1961.  Stine extrapolated based on previous rates of</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress and found that human speeds should become infinite in 1982.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Instead we saw a levelling off of the rate of progress.</i><br>
<p>
This is more an indicator that such rates of progress are dependent<br>
indicators, not leading indicators. That space technology has been at<br>
the mercy of public policy and military strategy, rather than driving<br>
the market, would explain why its been so retarded. One might also blame<br>
environmentalists and arms control advocates. Nuclear propulsion was<br>
supposed to be the next big leap in propulsion, which would have made<br>
space travel pretty cheap. Nowadays, its a pain in the butt to try to<br>
get a little old robot probe with a plutonium generator off the ground<br>
without an international protest. Advanced conventional propulsion, like<br>
the aerospike engine, which will be used on the Lockheed Venture Star,<br>
has been in use on Air Force and CIA spy planes for over a decade, but<br>
is completely black due to the restrictions of "national security". It<br>
wasn't until the late 80's that private business was legally allowed to<br>
compete in space, so its no wonder things have floundered.<br>
<p>
In this respect, its the economics of traveling to low earth orbit that<br>
are the stumbling block, not true space travel. Getting to low earth<br>
orbit means that you are halfway to anywhere in the solar system, in<br>
energy terms.<br>
