<i>&gt; Also, I don't think being a member of the</i><br>

<p>
*On average**, I would say that those who have joined ExI provide more<br>
content and less noise than those who don't. Of course there will be<br>
high-signal non-members and high-noise members, but there are too many who<br>
join the list without much of a clue about our interests and perspectives.<br>
This move will reduce the number of such folks, since the uninformed<br>
usually don't become ExI members until better informed.<br>
<p>
This move will also mean we can block spam.<br>
<p>
As I will explain in a separate message, improving the signal/noise ratio<br>
is one goal of this change, but it's not the main one. Even if that doesn't<br>
happen as expected, I think the move is desirable for ExI.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Others, who would contribute a lot to the list, may not be interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;joining the extropy institute, either for monetary reasons or because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not want to incur the wrath of those who would take out their petty</i><br>
<i>&gt;frustrations on the members of the extropian movement.(ie. misguided</i><br>
<i>&gt;neo-luddites) </i><br>
<p>
I don't understand this. If there are Luddites out there who want to hunt<br>
down extropians and transhumanists, they can do that as easily for the<br>
non-members as for the members. If someone is afraid of a Luddite attack,<br>
they should stay off all lists, or post anonymously.<br>
<p>
Harvey Newstrom says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wasn't around when the list became free again.  What was the reasoning</i><br>
<i>&gt;behind that decision?  Have the motivating factors changed?  I also was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;around when the PPL system of voluntary list-policing was abandoned.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened to the PPL experiment that governed the original list?</i><br>
<p>
It was too difficult to maintain records of who had paid the list fee and<br>
who had not. The change we are about to make should be much simpler to<br>
administer. Good thing too, since so many are too stingy to join the<br>
Institute so we have no money to pay for adminstration. :-)<br>
<p>
Damien Sullivan says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given the $95 price tag on membership mentioned in the most recent</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exponent newsletter, this may not be too likely.  Of course, it may</i><br>
<i>&gt;drive signal people away as well.  A list membership fee of $8 hit the</i><br>
<i>&gt;list hard some years ago.  $95?  I don't think I can justify that to</i><br>
<i>&gt;myself.  And the "benefits" were interesting: a t-shirt, mug, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;mousepad, oh my.</i><br>
<p>
Wow, Damien, I'm glad you're not doing marketing for ExI! You didn't<br>
mention the Exponent newsletter that keeps members up to date on what's<br>
happening and helps them network, the local meetings, or the substantial<br>
discount on the EXTRO conference (that paid for half the dues this time<br>
around).<br>
<p>
Damien, I thought you were a student. If so, the rate is merely $30. Hardly<br>
a burden. For those who think $95 is too much, note that Alcor yearly dues<br>
are $360, The Life Extension Foundation (which uses membership to sell many<br>
products) is $75, and the World Future Society professional membership is<br>
$95 ($175 for full prof. membership).<br>
<p>
We *have* to raise dues. Personally, I have worked some of the time for a<br>
ridiculously small amount, giving up opportunities for properly paying jobs<br>
in order to develop and disseminate extropian ideas. Most of the time I<br>
have worked for ExI for nothing. The other directors have worked for<br>
nothing. The advisors work for nothing. David McFadzean manages the list,<br>
the web site, and the domain for nothing. Derek Strong, our webmaster,<br>
manages the site for nothing. Those who contribute to Extropy (and now<br>
Extropy Online) do so for nothing.<br>
<p>
It does costs money to run an organization. The current membership dues are<br>
insufficient and we don't want to ask yet again for donations. I don't<br>
understand why so many capitalist-friendly people seem to expect us to do<br>
all that we do with such a pitiful income.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More interesting is the right to "sponsor one new member".  This implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;either that future membership will be restricted to those spoken for by</i><br>
<i>&gt;members, which is disturbing, </i><br>
<p>
No, it doesn't mean that. Why on Earth would we want to restrict membership<br>
entry only to those spoken for by others?<br>
<p>
or (more likely) that a current member<br>
<i>&gt;gets to bring in one new one for free. </i><br>
<p>
Yes. It's a way of accommodating those who feel they don't earn enough to<br>
join themselves, and who don't do anything for the Institute that would<br>
justify a lower rate.<br>
<p>
Ed Sona says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personally I think one of the issues is that, given the increase of</i><br>
interest in<br>
<i>&gt;extropy, the idea of single list for an international community is outdated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the communication in the ExI could be better distributed by separate</i><br>
<i>&gt;lists for different topics.  Also, an emphasis on local gatherings outside of</i><br>
<i>&gt;California and other forms of networking might help.  I for one would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hear from extropians and transhumanists in the Chicago area.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that a single list cannot serve all purposes. That's why we now<br>
have several local lists and will be adding others. We recently added a<br>
European list since we're seeing growing interest there. We are setting up<br>
the NodeNet forums -- special email lists focusing on particular topics.<br>
And we want to encourage the formation of more local groups and chapters.<br>
(Working with us to do this is a good way to get a break on or waiver of<br>
dues...) <br>
<p>
We would have more local meetings if more people were organizers. We've<br>
been adding more places to the Local Events section of the Exponent<br>
newsletter, and want to develop local activity further. I'm glad to hear<br>
that you're interested in getting together with others in Chicago, Ed. I'd<br>
love to work with you in getting it started. You may be the only doer in<br>
the area, so if you don't start something, it may not happen.<br>
<p>
Michael Butler says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes it's expensive, if this is the plan. But _I'll_ gamble a 1-year</i><br>
<i>&gt;membership if the people who stay all plan to make the experience worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;$95/yr to each other. I think of it as a pledge. I'm not being snotty about</i><br>
<i>&gt;the decision I've made to invest. I expect dividends or I'll cut my</i><br>
losses. :)<br>
<p>
Great! But remember it's not just the list that you're paying for. As with<br>
this year, members will receive a discount on EXTRO 4. Since I intend to<br>
attract some well-off folks interested in life extension, I expect us to<br>
make the registration higher to keep the organization alive, but to give a<br>
major discount to members. With that, the newsletter, the networking, the<br>
meetings, the new forums, the web site, the media work, etc., we will do<br>
all that we can to make it worth it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not being a member doesn't mean anything. Being a member means you put some</i><br>
<i>&gt;money where your mouth is.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Many people just want to talk and not do anything, nor do they want to<br>
make it possible for others to do anything. We appreciate very much our<br>
members, who are willing to back their values with a little cash.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, ExI isn't the only game in town. There is a lot of transhuman doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be done. Excelsior!</i><br>
<p>
I'm delighted to see the spread of transhumanism and the budding of other<br>
groups. I hope the new groups -- unlike ExI --- have wealthy founders. If<br>
not, they will end up either shutting down out of personal and financial<br>
exhaustion, or they will have to charge sufficient dues and deal with<br>
complaints.<br>
<p>
Geoff Smith says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The fact that you have to pay at least $100 dollars to join an institute</i><br>
<i>&gt;to participate on a general extropian mailing list reeks of one of those</i><br>
<i>&gt;cults where the members are wearing rags, and the leader is driving around</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a Mercedes.</i><br>
<p>
First, it's $95 (less for those with special arrangements), not "at least<br>
$100", and it's $30 for students. Perhaps you didn't intend it this way,<br>
Geoff, but the way you put it is sadly reversed. Many ExI members and<br>
potential members have very well paying jobs. Meanwhile, a number of those<br>
most active in getting things done work for nothing or for absurdly little.<br>
I'm embarrassed to admit that instead of driving a Mercedes, I drive an old<br>
Ford with well over 100,000 miles on it, and until very recently I didn't<br>
even have that. I live with a large amount of credit card debt thanks to<br>
working for ExI for extremely little instead of getting "a real job". And I<br>
am the *only* person who ExI has ever paid any kind of salary to.<br>
<p>
Your comment reminds me of a my very first TV appearance -- in England on<br>
the morning news in 1987 when I debated a Prof. of Surgery on cryonics. As<br>
we left the studio, the fellow turned back to me and sneeringly said "I'm<br>
sure you'll make a lot of money." Knowing how the folks at Alcor had worked<br>
for years for so little, this cheap shot made me furious.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I didn't see this until I read the updated mission statement.  I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt;not going to be able to renew next year at that price, and I can't </i><br>
<i>&gt;imagine that other members at my income level will be able to either. </i><br>
<p>
Kathryn: I wish there were more like you -- transhumanists who actually<br>
*do* something. Currently you are contributing to the Institute's work by<br>
acting as an editor for Extropy Online. We will be very happy to work out<br>
breaks for members who are not rolling in money and who are contributing in<br>
other ways. You are such a person.<br>

Onward!<br>
