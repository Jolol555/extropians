SPACEDEV TO ACQUIRE INTEGRATED SPACE SYSTEMS<br>
<p>
December 8, 1997, Steamboat Springs, CO - SpaceDev Chairman, James W.<br>
Benson, announced today the signing of a letter of intent whereby<br>
SpaceDev, a development-stage company, in an exchange of stock, will<br>
acquire 100% of San Diego-based Integrated Space Systems(ISS).  On close<br>
of this transaction, ISS will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceDev<br>
(OTC:PSDM).<br>
<p>
The acquisition will bring SpaceDev (www.SpaceDev.Com) closer to its goal<br>
of being the first commercial company to launch a privately financed<br>
spacecraft to scientifically analyze and land on a near earth asteroid as<br>
well as becoming the premier provider of high quality, low cost<br>
space-related consulting, design, planning and support services and<br>
products.<br>
<p>
ISS, a rapidly growing, profitable three-year-old aerospace engineering<br>
and technical services firm with estimated sales of $2 million in 1997,<br>
will provide SpaceDev with many of the aerospace engineering skills to<br>
build the Near Earth Asteroid Prospector (NEAP) and to develop future deep<br>
space missions for SpaceDev and its private and government customers.<br>
<p>
"Bringing ISS and SpaceDev together is a strategic first step for the<br>
growth of our business. The acquisition of ISS will give SpaceDev<br>
important capabilities in mission and spacecraft design, construction and<br>
testing; space and launch vehicle integration; and ground and mission<br>
control and operations," said Benson. "This acquisition will help move the<br>
mission from concept to reality."<br>
<p>
 "The exploration and economic development of space will be a hallmark of<br>
 the 21st century. We believe ISS skills and experience combined with<br>
 SpaceDev's vision is a great business opportunity as well as an exciting<br>
 venture into a new market with unlimited possibilities," said Phil Smith,<br>
 President and Chairman of ISS.<br>
<p>
SpaceDev, the world's first commercial space exploration company, intends<br>
to launch the first privately financed spacecraft to visit and land on<br>
another planetary body. NEAP provides the first opportunity for<br>
governments and companies to fly their instruments and experiments through<br>
deep space to an asteroid. SpaceDev intends to sell the data acquired by<br>
its own instruments as a commercial product to a wide variety of<br>
governments and private companies around the world.<br>
<p>
The Near Earth Asteroid Prospector, first in a series of SpaceDev<br>
missions, is currently scheduled to carry three of its own instruments to<br>
analyze the asteroid's size, and determine its composition and value. In<br>
addition to these, payload space is available on NEAP for up to six<br>
additional experiments or instruments. A price list outlining the cost for<br>
rides on NEAP was published in November and is available on SpaceDev's<br>
website, www.SpaceDev.Com.<br>
<p>
ISS, which employs more than 35 full- and part- time aerospace engineers<br>
and support staff will continue operations in its current San Diego<br>
facility, where SpaceDev plans to tap into the large base of aerospace<br>
expertise in California. The principals of ISS, formerly key program<br>
engineers and designers at General Dynamics, formed ISS when General<br>
Dynamics Space Systems Division was acquired by Martin Marietta in 1994.<br>
ISS engineers have been working as mentors to students at the University<br>
of California, San Diego on the NEAP mission for the past year. SpaceDev's<br>
base of operations will move from Steamboat Springs, CO, to San Diego in<br>
January. <br>
<p>
This news release contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may<br>
vary due to a variety of risk factors, including but not limited to,<br>
execution of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence,<br>
availability of substantial additional financing, dependence on<br>
management, government regulations, successful building and launching of<br>
spacecraft, dependence on outside contractors and other risks generally<br>
associated with a start-up development venture.<br>
