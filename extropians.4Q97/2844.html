OK Folks, Here are the final numbers:<br>
<p>
rabid gun owners: 20<br>
total guns owned: 114<br>
"Would if they could" non-owners, pro gun rights: 8<br>
Non-gun owners, and happy that way: 8<br>
<p>
Now, I don't happen to know how many subscribers there are to the list.<br>
If Max or someone could post a total number, I'd appreciate it. All we<br>
are trying to measure is if there is a greater percentage of total<br>
subscribers who are gun owners than the percentage found in the general<br>
population.<br>
<p>
Using the stats for the US, in which 60 million of the 250 million<br>
citizens are gun owners (this includes children and little babies, bed<br>
ridden oldsters, and everybody in prison, so there is a sizable<br>
percentage who aren't capable of owning a gun), we would have to have at<br>
the very least 84 subscribers to even seem to disprove the test<br>
statement, and this does leave out anyone so protective of their privacy<br>
on this list that they have not even thought that a private reply to me<br>
was safe.<br>
<p>
I would like to thank everybody who took part in this and associated<br>
threads this week. I personally think that the numbers show that<br>
extropian posters, those who are active participants, tend to be pro-gun<br>
to a far greater degree than the population as a whole, so I think that<br>
this might also be included in any description of extropians, as having<br>
this tendency.<br>
<p>
I personally view gun ownership as part and parcel with my Libertarian<br>
beleifs/opinions, and not just as a part, but as the guarranteeing right<br>
which creates all other rights for the individual. As previously posted,<br>
I think that history has shown, and this has been confimed by even the<br>
most heinous statists, like Mao, that, in his words,"Justice comes from<br>
the barrel of a gun". With a world where such tyrants still exist,<br>
conspire, plot, oppress, and rule, it is a moral imperative that any<br>
free thinking individual support individual gun ownership, and posess<br>
and be knowledgable in the use of guns and other weaponry. <br>
<p>
Political rights, authoritiy, and power are thought to be derived from<br>
one of two sources: a) as granted by God, which is known as the Natural<br>
Law doctrine, and from which tyrants throughout history have used to<br>
support the "divine right of kings", as well as that supported by the<br>
framers of the American Declaration of Independence and its<br>
COnstitution, and b) from the exercise of force by individuals willing<br>
to fight and die to gain such rights, authority, or power, either for<br>
themselves, or for the group of people they represent. Since<br>
Libertarians around the world tend to also be athiests, especially<br>
non-American Libertarians, I cannot understand any justification for a<br>
libertarian atheist to not support the force doctrine, and givne the<br>
nature of Libertarian philosophy, which holds that all power and rights<br>
derives from the individual, I cannot understand how any Libertarian<br>
atheist can not support the right of the individual to keep and bear<br>
arms. ANything other than this seems extremely hypocritical to me.<br>
