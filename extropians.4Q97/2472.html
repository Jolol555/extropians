Advanced civilizations probably have extensive cooling needs. Computing<br>
and communication equipment both work better at lower temperatures. A<br>
cooler computer means a faster computer with lower energy needs, and a<br>
cooler transceiver has lower thermal noise. Since these equipment cannot<br>
operate with perfect efficiency, they will need to eliminate waste heat.<br>
<p>
It's not too difficult to cool a system down to the temperature of the<br>
cosmic background radiation. All you need to do is build a radiator in<br>
interstellar space with a very large surface area, and connect it with the<br>
system you're trying to cool with some high thermal-conductance material.<br>
<p>
However, even at the cosmic background temperature of T=3K, erasing a bit<br>
still costs a minimum of k*T*ln 2 = 2.87e-23 J. What is needed is a way to<br>
efficiently cool a system down to near absolute zero. I think the only way<br>
to do it is with black holes. <br>
<p>
Black holes emit Hawking radiation at a temperature of<br>
T=h*c^3/(16*pi*G*M). With the mass of the sun, the temperature of a black<br>
hole would be about 10^-8 K. At this temperature, erasing a bit costs only<br>
about 10^-31 J. If you build an insulating shell outside the event horizon<br>
of a black hole, everything inside the shell would eventually cool down to<br>
the temperature of the black hole. However, it would not be necessary to<br>
build a complete shell around a black hole in order to take advantage of<br>
its low temperature. For example you can simply point the radiators of<br>
your black hole orbiter toward the black hole and insulate the side facing<br>
away from the black hole. <br>
<p>
If it's true that the only efficient way to cool material down to near<br>
absolute zero is with black holes, we should expect all sufficiently<br>
advanced civilizations to live near them. However testing this prediction<br>
may be difficult to test since they would have virtually no radiation<br>
signatures. <br>
