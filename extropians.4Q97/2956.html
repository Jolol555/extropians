<i>&gt; From:          anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk (Tony Hollick)</i><br>
<i>&gt;       With experience, it often became possible to see attackers and</i><br>
<i>&gt;       'attackees' seeking each other out, and pairing off.  Many of</i><br>
<i>&gt;       the 'attackees' seemd to give off 'attack me!' signals ('Kick</i><br>
<i>&gt;       me!' signals, in Eric Berne's (albeit flawed) Transactional</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Analysis theory. Clearly, learning to spot 'aggressor' signals</i><br>
<i>&gt;       and suppressing 'victim' flags would be most worthwhile.</i><br>
<p>
My daughter, at 14 years of age, 5 feet of height, and about 95 <br>
pounds of weight (and with absolutely no martial-arts training),  <br>
could generate "aggressor" signals plain enough to terrify her best <br>
friend when they went out for a walk *together*.<br>
<p>
The friend, unfortunately, couldn't stop sending "you're a big bad <br>
wolf and I'm a lame rabbit" signals if she were driving a tank.<br>
