I agree it's neither fair nor rational, but that's just how people are.<br>
It really is nearly universal; what's there to be amazed about?<br>

<p>
Of course it's ExI's decision.  But since ExI has goals of outreach and<br>
increasing membership, how people will react to their actions is a reasonable<br>
part of their decision.  A rational person has to account for others' <br>
irrationality.<br>
