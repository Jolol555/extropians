Damien Broderick said:<br>
<i>&gt;*Daedalus*, BTW, is the title of a long-established journal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;science and the arts, as well as the pseudonym of a witty scientist</i><br>
<i>&gt;who once had a weekly column in *New Scientist* and later moved, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think, to *Nature*.  His ideas were not a million miles from the wild</i><br>
<i>&gt;&amp; wacky stuff that appears on this list, although under his own name</i><br>
<i>&gt;he famously lambasted Drexler's nanotech.  (Ref'd in Ed Regis's NANO!</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think, but since the fiend hasn't included an index...)</i><br>
<p>
Daedalus (David E. H. Jones) did lambaste nanotechnology while<br>
reviewing Regis's book Nano!  Thus, Regis's book (at least the first<br>
edition) predates the criticism and could not refer to it, barring<br>
temporal peculiarities.<br>
<p>
The reference is:<br>
"Technical boundless optimism," by David E. H. Jones, Nature,<br>
Vol. 374, No. 6525, April 27 1995, pages 835-837.<br>
<p>
A response to the Jones review was created by Ralph Merkle and is<br>
available on the web together with responses to other critics:<br>
<a href="http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/nanocritics.html">http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/nanocritics.html</a><br>
<p>
While attending the Foresight conference, I asked Ralph Merkle if Jones<br>
had replied to the cogent points contained in Merkle's commentary and he<br>
said that Jones had not replied. <br>
