I just found a GISS web page with a temperature graph. Oddly, the<br>
graph starts at 1880, which is close to the coldest point in the 19th<br>
century; go back another sixty years and you'd see little warming at<br>
all. There's another interesting web page at: <br>

<a href="http://www.vision.net.au/~daly/low-head.htm">http://www.vision.net.au/~daly/low-head.htm</a><br>
<p>
Which covers an Australian station used in CRU studies, showing that <br>
the supposed 1C temperature increase there over the last few decades <br>
was due not to global warming, but to trees growing nearby and blocking <br>
out a cold wind. How many more such dubious measurements have been <br>
included in the global warming computer-aided guesses?<br>
