<p>
How nice, I'm just doing some reading on that right now.  <br>
<p>
Modern human intelligence may result from combining different modules,<br>
each with a different function and different learning mechanisms.  For<br>
example, we and other primates seem to have, to a greater or lesser degree<br>
depending upon individual and species, innate knowledge of (1) social<br>
interactions within the species, (2) an understanding of biology (folk<br>
taxonomy, paying attention to life cycles, etc), and (3) a technical<br>
intelligence (talent for building tools).  All these focused modules exist<br>
alongside the less powerful learning mechanisms of "general intelligence."<br>
<p>
Chimps make tools, but do not act as though they have as good a grasp of<br>
what they're doing as humans --they are using general learning techniques,<br>
not skills specific to the medium.  Perhaps consequentally, chimps must<br>
struggle just to maintain what tool-making knowledge they have.<br>
<p>
When analyses from different modules can be applied at the same time, we<br>
make analogies based on similarities in pattern.  If we apply social<br>
knowledge to animals or landscape (or mythical entities), that's<br>
anthropomorphism.  If we apply natural history knowledge to humans, that's<br>
totemism.  Thus, early religion is a product of cognitive fluidity.<br>
<p>
A literary theorist who has followed the progress of cognitive science<br>
(and whose name and books I forget) proposes that our memory operates in<br>
terms of literature -we remember a story, the detail of which are<br>
'hyperlinked' to other skills and knowledges.  For example, when I think<br>
about living in Austria, I remember practicing German, traveling, learning<br>
Habsburg history, and so forth, as I remember specific events --the<br>
weekend Sasha, Oliver and I went to Budapest, what we saw, what we said.<br>
Thus, we have narative memory with oral history and pedagogy, and<br>
considering how long humanity spent as foragers and huter-gatherers, it<br>
should be no surprise what a hold mythology has on us.  The practice of<br>
critical thinking, OTOH, is very much younger.<br>
<p>
When we combine knowledge of dream lives with the practice of building<br>
tools to alter our living condition, that's the beginning of art and<br>
artisanry.  Hunting weapons are designed with specific animals involved,<br>
clothing is made in response to weather conditions, designs are added<br>
according to correspondences with mythology.<br>
<p>
Consciousness, under this perview, is paying attention to what you're<br>
doing --each tool, each story, each social exchange is important as it is<br>
used or as it occurs.  Meaning has selective advantage.<br>
<p>
Where _exactly_ does language fall into all this?  We're not sure.<br>
Certainly humans have language, and other primates don't.  All chimp<br>
language studies, though in the past interpreted differently, are now<br>
taken as evidence that, while apes can use words, they do not have a<br>
capacity for syntax.  Using words is great, but without syntax language<br>
remains at the level of a 2-year-old human.  And certainly humans make<br>
great use of technology while chimps do not.  Can we safely adduce<br>
language as the primary memetic vector?   I certainly think so, but more<br>
tool-using species would be great for comparison.<br>
<p>
I think we can say that a species or genre of entities (AIs, Powers) needs<br>
language or a functional equivilent in order to have memetic evolution.<br>
Certainly a species that relied more on the individual's use of, say,<br>
spatial or emotional understanding over inter-individual communication<br>
would use very different approaches to memetic evolution.<br>
<p>
These are the main sources I've using.<br>
