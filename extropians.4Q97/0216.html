Well, maybe.  The "Greeks" were not as monolithic as your post<br>
paints them.  The Linear scripts developed among the Minoan/Mycenean<br>
civilization, whose descendants were mostly to be found among the<br>
slave and helot classes of the civilization usually referred to as<br>
"classical Greece".  Hellas and the Aegean went through several<br>
centuries of illiteracy (this was the time when the Homeric bards<br>
were creating the Iliad and the Odyssey in their long-term memories)<br>
after invaders from the north finished off Thera's damage.  The<br>
descendants of those illiterate invaders were the people whose<br>
names come to mind when we think of classical Greece.  And they<br>
learned how to write from the Phoenicians because the Linear scripts<br>
were completely forgotten centuries before they even began to take<br>
an interest in literacy.<br>
<p>
It might even have been a clever bilingual Phoenican sailor/trader,<br>
fluent in Greek, who realized that to use his alphabet to write in<br>
Greek he'd need to assign vowel values to some of the otherwise<br>
useless letters.  Don't jump too quickly to credit the Greeks with<br>
this innovation.  (They already have scores and scores to their<br>
credit anyway.)<br>
<p>
The Phoenicians, for anyone who cares, were largely the same people<br>
who were earlier known (e. g. in the Old Testament) as the Canaanites,<br>
and whose colonists were later known to the Romans as the Carthaginians<br>
or Punics.  One thing that is interesting about them is that they<br>
were the first people I can think of who established a merchant<br>
aristocracy that lasted for hundreds (maybe thousands) of years.<br>
In most civilizations of that era, merchants were *never* allowed<br>
to get the upper hand over landowning soldier types.  This is one<br>
reason why the Hebrews hated them... at the time of the Hebrew-Canaanite<br>
conflict, the Hebrews were warrior herdsmen and the Canaanites were<br>
urban traders.  Likewise, the Romans hated them with a passion,<br>
the Romans being prominently countrified landowning soldiers at<br>
that point in their history.<br>
<p>
Hanno the Carthaginian apparently led the first ship to circumnavigate<br>
Africa:  he brought back stories of the noonday sun appearing in<br>
the northern sky.  This was everything he needed to claim to utterly<br>
discredit himself in the eyes of his contemporaries, and utterly<br>
clear himself in the eyes of we latter-day readers.<br>
<p>
It is widely claimed that the Punics practiced human sacrifice to<br>
their gods (one of whom, I believe, was named MAMMON), including<br>
sacrifice of children.  But then again, history is written by the<br>
winners, and after the Canaanites got the stuffing knocked out of<br>
them by the Hebrews and the Phoenicians by Alexander, the Romans<br>
finished up by plowing salt into the soil of Carthage and selling<br>
the entire population into slavery... let's just say I'd take the<br>
tales told by the winners with a grain of, er, salt.<br>
<p>
Another slam that one finds against the Punic peoples in books like<br>
the Encyclopedia Britannica is that they produced little of artistic<br>
interest.  I figure they were too busy making money by paying<br>
attention to what other people wanted, and finding and shipping it<br>
from far places for them.  The proud altruism of the merchant<br>
sometimes goes so far as creating alphabets for one's trading<br>
partners.<br>
