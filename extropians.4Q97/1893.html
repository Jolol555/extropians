<i>&gt;Michael Lorrey (retroman@together.net)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Meeee Toooooo! Thanks, Abraham, for your first truly meaningful posting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And, at the risk of disobeying the rules of this list, Ian, STFU re TWA</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 800, OK?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As much as I agree with you, Ian, if you aren't going to file a lawsuit</i><br>
<i>&gt;against the press and the FBI, then just give it up. </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: The supreme jury is the public.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You have already</i><br>
<i>&gt;made the Missile Theory synonymous with terms like The Grassy Knoll,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Roswell, etc. so you have accomplished something. Ranting on and on </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: It was the list of facts that I was <br>
  requested to present that were defined as <br>
  "ranting." I disagree with the definition <br>
  of a carefully ordered presentation of <br>
  fact as "ranting."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;on a mailing list is not doing you any favors in improving your </i><br>
<i>&gt;tarnished image, </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: My image was tanished by lies, specifically<br>
  the lie that I said my work was a hoax. I believe <br>
  that only facts can remedy lies. I'm sure you agree.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;and is starting to tick off the freinds you do have here. </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: I don't think people who initiate baseless<br>
  charges of "paranoid delusion" and "ranting"<br>
  are necessarily friends. I'll argue over a<br>
  point even against someone who is a friend.<br>
  For the process of inquiry to bear the fruit<br>
  of truth, personal issues must be put aside.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you want to do something constructive, hire a lawyer, </i><br>
<i>&gt;hire a publicist, publish a book, or go postal on the FBI.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Good ideas. Thanks.<br>
<p>
