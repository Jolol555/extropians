Well, they need to look at it this way: If they developed an autonomous<br>
agent to watch cancellation rates on flights. If the rates went too<br>
high, the flight is cancelled and a phased inspection of the plane is<br>
conducted. THis way the airline could claim that they actively work to<br>
prevent crashes before they happen.... This could be a positive PR<br>
thing. Even if there was absolutely NO scientific basis for it, I could<br>
guarrantee you that that airline would get more business if it claimed<br>
some sort of psychic monitoring like this... morons will beleive<br>
anything...<br>
