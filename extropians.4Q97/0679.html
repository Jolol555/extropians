Many people who are or are related to refugees or immigrants from<br>
socialist states tend to feel this way because nobody ever told them<br>
that this was the first step they allowed to happen that culminated in<br>
the economic debacles that were the governments in those states.<br>
<p>
Most people would like to be permanently retired as well, but we all saw<br>
how that sort of system worked for those living in the "socialist<br>
workers paradise". Most people who think that they want "gun control"<br>
actually want guns to be kept away from "the other guy". They think that<br>
they are perfectly capable of responsibly handling, and have a right to<br>
firearms.<br>
<p>
As a freind of mine who is an intelligence consultant to one of these<br>
formerly authoritarian states told me, a bureaucrat he knew said,"We<br>
have a right to bear arms, but you must apply for a permit to buy a gun<br>
first, and there is no limit on how long before we have to issue the<br>
permit. We found that once we took away people's guns, taking their<br>
money was real easy."<br>
<p>
It is no accident that most of the gun control laws in european<br>
countries were passed in the early 1930's. They were passed by<br>
legislatures dominated by local nazi parties and their allies (a dirty<br>
little secret in europe: most european countries had very active nazi<br>
parties in the 30's, which simply changed their names to Socialist Party<br>
or Democratic Socialist Party, etc after the war). It is also no<br>
accident that a)the US has the most liberal gun control laws and b) over<br>
the past 50 years the US has been the only country without serious<br>
communist political or military insurgencies. Most everybody else has<br>
been under a state of martial law of one kind or another at one time or<br>
another, or given in completely to authoritarian controls.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just for the record, there are over 20,000 gun laws in the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; already.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, and most of the early ones are almost word for word translations of<br>
gun control laws passed by Nazi Germany in the 30's.<br>
<p>
Its funny how the biggest proponents of gun control (Gun Control, Inc.,<br>
Sarah Brady's little gestapo) commissioned a couple of U of Chicago<br>
profs to do a study of FBI crime stats from between 1979 to 1992 to<br>
examine the effect of "right to carry" concealed weapons liberalization<br>
laws in a number of states in the early 90's. The profs found that<br>
states with such laws saw an average 8% drop in violent crime rates<br>
after such laws were passed, while states with no such laws had little<br>
or no change. Needless to say GCI canned the profs and hired other<br>
people to cherry pick the data in ways that would support their<br>
previously determined conclusions.<br>
<p>
The American psych (head shrinkers) association (whatever it is called)<br>
also has found that the irrational fear of guns is a recognized mental<br>
disorder. Well, at least we know that these sick people have no need of<br>
help from the Americans with Disabilities Act, they already are in<br>
charge.<br>
