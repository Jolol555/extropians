Although we do not yet know enough characteristics of biological <br>
neurons to create exact simulations of such a neurons,<br>
I have seen simulations which were able to mimic the behavior <br>
of very simple life forms possessing very small neural networks <br>
(&lt;100 neurons) using artificial neural networks.<br>
<p>
Because of biological evolution it seems that if quantum systems <br>
should be present in the neurons of humans they should also be <br>
present in the neurons of simple organisms, because these <br>
neurons appear to be quite similar.<br>
<p>
Based on this assumption quantum systems, even if present, do not <br>
seem to be involved in determining the behavior of biological <br>
neural networks. <br>
<p>
IMHO the known characteristics of neural networks are sufficient <br>
to account for the behavior of all biological neural networks, <br>
including the ones which seem to posses consciousness.<br>
<p>
The presence of quantum systems in biological neurons seems <br>
very unlikely. <br>
