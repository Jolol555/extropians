No, the density difference is small.<br>

<p>
No, it's true; but we can make such temperatures only amidst explosions and <br>
that's a poor simulation of the core.<br>
<p>

Oh, I knew I would regret that comment.  There's nothing mystical about the<br>
core according to this theory; it's just a big electromagnet made of a<br>
material<br>
absent at the surface of the earth but quite mundane in the core.<br>
