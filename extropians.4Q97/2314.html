PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 350 December 10, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben<br>
Stein<br>
<p>
QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally<br>
demonstrated by physicists at the University of Innsbruck (Anton<br>
Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@ uibk.ac.at; Dik<br>
Bouwmeester, Dik.Bouwmeester@uibk.ac.at).  First proposed in<br>
1993 by Charles Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118), quantum<br>
teleportation allow physicists to take a photon (or any other<br>
quantum-scale particle, such as an atom), and transfer its properties<br>
(such as its polarization) to another photon--even if the two photons<br>
are on opposite sides of the galaxy.  Note that this scheme<br>
transports the particle's properties to the remote location and not the<br>
particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk, whose body<br>
is destroyed at the teleporter and reconstructed at his destination,<br>
the state of the original photon must be destroyed to create an exact<br>
reconstruction at the other end.  In the Innsbruck experiment, the<br>
researchers create a pair of photons A and B that are quantum<br>
mechanically "entangled": the polarization of each photon is in a<br>
fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely<br>
defined interrelationship.  If one photon is later measured to have,<br>
say, a horizontal polarization, then the other photon must "collapse"<br>
into the complementary state of vertical polarization.  In the<br>
experiment, one of the entangled photons A arrives at an optical<br>
device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose<br>
polarization state is to be teleported.  These two photons enter a<br>
device where they become indistinguishable, thus effacing our<br>
knowledge of M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying<br>
Kirk).What the researchers have verified is that by ensuring that<br>
M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization<br>
would now have to assume the same value as M's. In other words,<br>
although M and B have never been in contact, B has been imprinted<br>
with M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy,<br>
instantaneously. This does not mean that faster-than-light<br>
information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station<br>
must still convey the fact that teleportation had been successful by<br>
making a phone call or using some other light-speed or<br>
sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't<br>
foresee the possibility of teleporting large-scale objects like humans,<br>
this scheme will have uses in quantum computing and cryptography. <br>
