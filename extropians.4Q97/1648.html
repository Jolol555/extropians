<i>&gt;Since Mr. Goddard claims to have all this "proof" let him </i><br>

<i>&gt;documentation </i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: Below I confirm each evidentiary claim I made, <br>
 which Abraham Moses Genen has requested that I do:<br>
<p>
<p>
CLAIM 1: There is PROOF that the military <br>
lied about their activities on July 17,'96. <br>
<p>
<p>
     PROOF: At a Department of Defense press conference <br>
     on July 23, 1996, DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon said:<br>
<p>
             I’m not aware [that] there were any <br>
             military exercises in the area. I’ve <br>
             been told by the Joint [Chiefs of] <br>
             Staff that there were not. [DOC 1]<br>
<p>
     However, after eight months of such denials, on March <br>
     22, 1997, Newsday [DOC 2] reported that the Navy finally <br>
     admitted that there were (a) military exercises and (b) <br>
     three Navy submarines in the area at the time of the <br>
     TWA 800 accident. (Now the story has changed again,<br>
     and the number of subs in the area is down to 2.<br>
     Interesting: recently a woman contacted Richard<br>
     Russell saying her husband was the captain of<br>
     a sub off LI that shot down TWA 800.?? I'll<br>
     have to see if the sub she named is the <br>
     sub that just vanished into thin air.)<br>
<p>
DOCUMENT 1: <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul96/t072396_t0723asd.html">http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul96/t072396_t0723asd.html</a><br>
DOCUMENT 2: <a href="http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm">http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm</a><br>
<p>
  Rather than repost it, here you will find many more, well, <br>
  lies pertaining to military asset locations and activities <br>
  on July 17, 1996: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm</a> <br>
  and a few here: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm</a><br>
<p>
<p>
CLAIM 2: There is proof the govt continues to lie about such. <br>
<p>
  This proof is derived from many facts cited here: <br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm</a> and the fact <br>
  that just yesterday, James Kallstrom said at the FBI's<br>
  closing press conference that there were no military <br>
  exercises in the area on the night of the crash, which <br>
  contradicts Navy admissions after the radar tapes were<br>
  leaked: <a href="http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm">http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm</a> <br>
<p>
<p>
CLAIM 3: There is proof that the FBI has acted to cover up facts. <br>
<p>
  Don't you have web access? I don't feel it <br>
  appropriate to post such a large document: <br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm</a><br>
  read that document, the proof's in there.<br>
<p>
<p>
CLAIM 4: There is photographic evidence of a military drone-<br>
type aerial device a few miles and moments from the crash. <br>
<p>
  Here it is: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm</a><br>
<p>
  The FBI says that their experts say it is <br>
  a plane. Can you find a plane that is shaped<br>
  like a rod with a luminous end? I can't. But<br>
  I can find many target drones that fit the <br>
  bill better than any manned plane. Atomist<br>
  logic dictates that if Y is like X, but <br>
  Y is not like Z, Y is more likely to<br>
  be X than Z. Ergo: the object is <br>
  most likely a target drone.<br>
<p>
<p>
CLAIM 5: There are over 100 witnesses of a missile-like <br>
streak rising from the ocean to impact TWA 800. <br>
<p>
  Again, I cannot post here all I have at my <br>
  website. I have amassed an extensive collection<br>
  of witness accounts, including a triangulation<br>
  of their sightings. Study them if you want to<br>
  see how clear and consistent they are: <br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm</a><br>
<p>
  In reply to your comments pertaining to eyewitnesses:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not really interested in so-called "eye witnesses" whose </i><br>
<i>&gt;imaginations can easily play tricks on them. Any first year </i><br>
<i>&gt;law student knows that "eye witnesses" are rarely consistant </i><br>
<i>&gt;or reliable. </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: But in this case they are consistent. Witness <br>
  accounts are admissible evidence in all courts of law. <br>
  Uniformity of accounts in over 150 witnesses increases <br>
  the reliability to virtually 100%. Here is a mathematical <br>
  analysis of the probability of eyewitness accuracy using <br>
  the case of only 50 witness (as an early report cited):<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/probabilities.html">http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/probabilities.html</a><br>
 <br>
<p>
CLAIM 6: There is massive penetration deformation to <br>
the exterior fuselage panels exceeding the psi strength <br>
of a CFT explosion.<br>
<p>
   Again, I can't post a photo here. You'll have to visit <br>
   the webpage: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm</a><br>
   go to the bottom graphic and click on the lower photos<br>
   therein. The area of massive fuselage-panel-penetration <br>
   deformation would have experienced a 8 psi shockwave<br>
   from a CFT explosion. The radical pig-tailed deformation <br>
   there would require forces over 1000 psi.  This area <br>
   of analysis is what I was getting into before dropping<br>
   the case, but I'm happy to say that others, with exten-<br>
   sive aviation and engineering expertise are working on<br>
   such a mathematical analysis of damage to the airframe.<br>
<p>
<p>
   RECONSTRUCTION STILL OFF-LIMITS<br>
<p>
   I spoke with a free-lance journalist who attended the <br>
   FBI press conference, and a press visit to the hangar<br>
   yesterday to see the reconstruction of the part of the <br>
   plans that is allowed to be seen. The nose section remains<br>
   hidden. All of the visitors were prohibited from viewing<br>
   the left side of the plane. I thought with the FBI off <br>
   the case, and it being no longer a criminal investigation,<br>
   that the evidence was supposed to be open... NOT. Guess<br>
   how many major media reports will tell you that access<br>
   to the left side was prohibited? None. Mark my word.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, in the absence of such legitimately meaningful </i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence and continued specious and uncorroborated claims, psychotherapy </i><br>
<i>&gt;from a competent licensed clinician might be in order. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think it's appalling, not only the abusive<br>
  treatment those who REALLY question authority are <br>
  subjected to, but the utter lack of knowledge of<br>
  the case on the part of those that will so quickly <br>
  launch into vicious smears on those who question.<br>
<p>
  It seems your quite certain of the truth a priori <br>
  to inquiry. I do not profess such surety as you.<br>
  I present what I see as relevant evidence in the <br>
  case, and let you take it from there. Maybe the<br>
  Navy didn't shoot it down, but why should ques-<br>
  tioning official claims and making a case against <br>
  be grounds for medical treatment. That's just <br>
  an outrageous attempt to stifle free inquiry!<br>
<p>
