The value of self-defense, surely, is reflected to some extent<br>
in the price of the weapon, just as the value of nutrition and<br>
flavor are reflected in the price of a tangerine.<br>

*All* goods and services sold have this kind of externality<br>
- economists call it consumer excess, I think.  The seller<br>
internalizes as much of that excess as it can get, but never<br>
gets all of it, because you can't readily tell a customer who<br>
will get great benefit out of the product from one who'll<br>
benefit only marginally over the cost.<br>
<p>
Why single out weapons for scrutiny of these "externalities"?<br>
(Sorry if I've missed some context here, I don't always<br>
read my mail in order)<br>
