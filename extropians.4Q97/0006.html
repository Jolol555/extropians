<p>
That is a very good question; I'm not sure I can give an equally good<br>
answer since it depends on a lot of parameters.<br>
<p>
Basically, the neurons contain more potassium ions than sodium ions<br>
and outside the membrance the concentrations are reversed. This sets<br>
up a membrane potential of around -70 mV. In the membrane there are<br>
ion channels that can allow the ions to flow in and out; when they open<br>
the cell is depolarized and the membrane potential increases (the cell<br>
fires). Many of these channels are voltage dependent: they open if the<br>
membrance potential is above a certain threshold, set by the shape<br>
and properties of the protein molecule making up the channel. So if the<br>
cell is depolarized above their threshold, they will open, ions will<br>
start to flow, more channels will open and a chain reaction sets in,<br>
and the cell fires (as it becomes maximally depolarized other voltage-<br>
dependent channels set in, and the cell starts to hyperpolarize again).<br>
<p>
So the exact threshold is set by:<br>
*	The ion concentrations in the cell and surrounding liquid.<br>
*	What ion channels are present<br>
*	If various chemicals have linked to the ion channels <br>
*	Cell geometry<br>
*	Passive membrance properties<br>
+ a lot of other things we have not yet discovered. <br>
<p>
The most common way of modifying the threshold is not to change it,<br>
but to change the resting potential of the cell. If the cell contains<br>
much calcium, its potential will be lower and it is harder to fire;<br>
many regulating systems in the neurons depend on changing the calcium<br>
levels (it also acts as a primitive internal messenger signal for <br>
a variety of purposes). <br>
