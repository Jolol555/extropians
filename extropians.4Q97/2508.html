Thanks for this. <br>
<p>
I had a somewhat similar experience while living with a<br>
partner-of-six-years in the then very peaceful and rather Scandinavian town<br>
of Minneapolis, though nowhere near as harrowing as what you describe. <br>
<p>
Ours was a second story apartment, with a "blind", dimly-lit set of<br>
catwalks linking all the back floors of seventeen separate dwellings. The<br>
first contact with the bad guy was his filching my partner's purse off of<br>
the (unlocked but "landlord-chained"--after all, the back gate was locked,<br>
right? and everyone in the building knew and liked each other--very similar<br>
to a college dorm in that way) back door knob, through the crack afforded<br>
by the affixed chain.<br>
<p>
Doesn't sound so bad, right?<br>
<p>
Nothing like this had ever before happened to anyone in that building,<br>
according to the (trustworthy) resident manager.<br>
<p>
I'll spare you all the gory details; suffice it to say that the cops<br>
managed to catch this guy and his wheel man/partner, and still in their<br>
possession was _the newly-minted key of the just-changed locks_ that would<br>
have permitted these two creeps free access to all seventeen dwellings. And<br>
yes, they had long long arrest records.<br>
<p>
Even though neither one of us directly encountered this goblin, the sense<br>
of violation lasted a long time.<br>
<p>
++<br>
<p>
I'd like to add a few metacomments, if I may, about this entire thread and<br>
the related particular element of world (certainly not just USA) culture:<br>
<p>
1) It is an observed fact that bullies and fools frequently have use for<br>
firearms.<br>
<p>
2) It _does not therefore follow_ that decent people have _no_ use for<br>
firearms. Even ugly ones.<br>
<p>
This sobers me, but I've come to terms with it. I am even able to consider<br>
a third point relatively coolly:<br>
<p>
3) There is no magic in a uniform (or a job description) that transforms a<br>
bully or a fool into an honest (let alone a _decent_) person. Where is<br>
Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso when we really need it?<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>
<p>
MMB<br>
