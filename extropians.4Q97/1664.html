<i>&gt; Understood.  I actually think crossbreeding would not help much.  It would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be too</i><br>
<i>&gt; random/chaotic.  I doubt it would produce viable much less fertile</i><br>
<i>&gt; offspring.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; only reason I went on with this was to clear up matters in my own head.  I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; think, though, that uplifting chimps by other methods might prove helpful in</i><br>
<i>&gt; augmenting humans.  Also, I suspect, a lot of the developmental patterns are</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar between apes and humans, such that insertion of genetic sequences</i><br>
<i>&gt; might have similar effects in both.</i><br>

So it seems that crossbreeding would not be an appropriate form of<br>
uplifting, and possibly not a form of uplifting at all.  <br>
<p>
Thanks for an interesting debate on this topic.  This was the kind of<br>
discussion that I was hoping for when I posted the crossbreeding<br>
question.  <br>
<p>
I think it's important for researchers to hash out sensitive questions<br>
before they become issues in the media and general public.  I expect a<br>
strong public backlash against genetic research once we begin altering<br>
existing species in a significant way.  Advocates of such research need<br>
to be prepared for this.  If we cannot quell negative public opinion<br>
with reasonable arguments as to what is ethical and unethical then I<br>
fear that public pressure will lead to over restrictive government<br>
regulation of reaserch.  <br>
