Alas, I don't expect fully reversible suspensions to emerge as a result of<br>
the Prometheus project -- physics seems to interfere all too strongly<br>
here. But a dramatic enhancement of current suspension protocols -- why,<br>
certainly. (And we all should be _very_ interested in enhancement of such<br>
protocols, methinks).<br>

<p>
Susceptibility to 'we all are already immortal' or 'ignore death ignore<br>
death ignore death' memes is an integral part of human genotype -- which<br>
made perfect sense before immortality has become a nonephemerous item<br>
(which sounds suspiciously like the first type of memoids btw, and thus<br>
may trigger memeimmunological response) due to the advent of cryonics. I<br>
believe it's a cryonics FAQ item.<br>
