<i>&gt;&gt; Geoff Smith:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Does G=F6del prove that mathematics is infinitely complex, or just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; incomprehensibly so?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Anders Sandberg:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think infinitely complex is the likely choice. I'm not sure I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prove it (metamathematics is not my strong suit), but given the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; results by Chaitin about the random and non-algorithmic structures</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the natural numbers it seems that the complexity of mathematics</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is infinite, not just incomprehensible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect the actual answer is "both". The kinds of propositions which</i><br>
<i>&gt; meet Godel's criterion are lengthy, involuted and not the kind of thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; human minds find easy to process. Note that the use of computers to help</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematical proofs have already produced very lengthy complex proofs</i><br>
<i>&gt; which require teams of mathematicians to verify.</i><br>
<p>
The only objective meaning of "infinitely complex" I can think of is<br>
axiomatically true: "mathematics" is simply "the set theorems expressible<br>
in mathematical terms".  The cardinality of that set is that same as the<br>
cardinality of largest set of symbols in the language.  We can never<br>
actually write down more than Aleph-null theorems (the number of integers),<br>
but since mathematics includes real numbers, of which there are Aleph-one,<br>
the cardinality of mathematical theorems is at least that.<br>
<p>
Godel really has nothing to do with complexity at all.  It is nothing more<br>
than the proof that of that infinite number of mathematical theorems,<br>
the set of "true" theorems and the set of "provable" ones differ.<br>
