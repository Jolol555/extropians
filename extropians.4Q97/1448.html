I have reviewed the Lojban pages and stick to this statement.  Just<br>
because you don't call a word a noun or verb doesn't mean that it really<br>
is something other than a noun or a verb.  That phonetic string X is a<br>
verb and Y is a noun is not just a categorization but a description of<br>
structure.  It's interesting how flexibly Lojban handles transfering<br>
meaning, but it still has verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech, just as<br>
do other natural languages.<br>
<p>
I have doubts about the whole project, though; just a cursory glance over<br>
the description revealed a passle of mistakes no one with knowledge of<br>
linguistics would make; for example, calling Lojban in its current state a<br>
pidgin.  Just because it lacks a lot of vocabulary doesn't make it a<br>
pidgin; no pidgin has the structural detail its creators have devoted.<br>
