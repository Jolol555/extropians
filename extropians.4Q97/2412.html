<i>&gt; &gt;Thats accelerating performance. To disprove the usefulness of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quote, take a 98 lb weakling in the end zone of a football field.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Take a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;240 lb linebacker in the opposite end zone. Have them accelerate to</i><br>
<i>&gt; full</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;speed, and hit each other head on. Who do you think is going to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;seriously hurt????</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why don't you try repeating this silly analogy by giving the 98 pound</i><br>
<i>&gt; weakling a full set of pads and regulation football gear and strip</i><br>
<i>&gt; the linebacker naked.  The weakling will still only weigh around 120</i><br>
<i>&gt; pounds but will be able to walk away from the collision, unlike the</i><br>
<i>&gt; linebacker.  Or to stretch the silly analogy games even further, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; not ask yourself how it is that cops can walk around wearing nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; but a thin vest of composites and polymers and still live after being</i><br>
<i>&gt; shot with a piece of lead moving fast enough to have KE that makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; your linebacker look like a lightweight?  Kenetic energy is important</i><br>
<i>&gt; when trying to figure out who will survive a collision, but you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; better off betting your life on smart designers and materials</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers than high-school physics.</i><br>

Once again, you are comparing apples and oranges. If such high strength<br>
construction were to be used in vehicles, it would be applied to both<br>
minicars and 1/2 ton pickups, so in my analogy as amended by you, both<br>
the 98lbder and the linebacker would have padding, since they would both<br>
have "current technology". In such a case, who would be hurt more????<br>
Stop avoiding the answer you know I am expecting....<br>
<p>
In the case of you cop/kevlar vest  vs. bullet: Its easy to stop a<br>
bullet, as its a puny little thing, and the vest does its job not by<br>
being impervious to bullets, but by being impervious enough that they<br>
don't penetrate all the way through by the time the vest has spread ALL<br>
of the bullets kinetic energy across the wearer's entire chest surface.<br>
TO be able to use your analogy, the cop is the 1/2ton truck, and the<br>
bullet is the minicar. Ever look at what happens to a bullet that hits a<br>
vest???? Is it reusable? I didn't think so. Is the cop reusable? Most of<br>
the time. Thanks for the proof....<br>
