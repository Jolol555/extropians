<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; The funny thing is, by ASCII code, his name in numbers does not add up</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to 666, contrary to Mac/Fundamentalists everywhere. It only adds up to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  666 if you count his last last name (I don't know the proper term for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it) of III (as in The Third) as being either 111 as in one -one -one,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  which it is not, it is roman numerals III and three I's in ascii don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  add up to 3, which would be the neccessary result to get 666 as a sum</i><br>
<i>&gt;  for his whole name, or you'd have to call that name as "3", which would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be wrong, because if you used arabic numerals, it would be 3rd for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "third" so ascii is off again. This is one more example of idiots not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  doing their homework.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, but it still works doesnt it? Instead of translating the 3</i><br>
into<br>
<i>&gt; the number 3 represents, they just left it as 3.  Everything else is</i><br>
fine.<br>
<i>&gt;  What do you think about the Pope's number? And what does TAANSTAFL mean?</i><br>

I remember, for a week or so ago, Anders and a few others posted about<br>
"proofing" Astrology, and other weird Ideas... I have read an article by<br>
Asimov, where he takes a number any number, and shows the numerologistical<br>
significance of this very number. I could probably do the same thing...<br>
(Fact is, with 1,2,3,4,5,7,9 and 13 as "holy" numbers, one has rather much<br>
mobility...)<br>
<p>
It isn't certain that 666 is the number of the beast, many translations of<br>
the bible say 606.<br>
<p>
I personally, regard the last part of the New Testament (I cannot remember<br>
the english name, but it's the part with all the magic numbers everywhere)<br>
as bullshit. (Excuse my french, all you cristians out there.)<br>
<p>
I've read *the* major epos in ancient Nordic believe (Vikings etc.). It is<br>
more or less identical, and says just as little about what life's about...<br>
<p>
Someone:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Java is being touted these days.  If Microsoft ported Word and Excel to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Jave people at least wouldn't have to deal with Windows.  </i><br>
<p>
YakWaxx:<br>
<i>&gt; Making applications in Java??  Not likely.</i><br>
<p>
Why not?? It's a rather nice language, especially since it runs on almost<br>
any processor, without that the programmer has to take to much of a special<br>
care... It is also rather stable, virii programming in Java would be rather<br>
difficult...<br>
<p>
Geoff:<br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Java is not an OS, it's a</i><br>
programming<br>
<i>&gt; language, a lot like C.</i><br>
<p>
Ever heard of JavaOS ?? Comes from Sun, is an OS written in and for Java...<br>
