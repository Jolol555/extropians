Moore's "Law" gets different versions because it's not as much of a "law" as<br>
most people claim.  Over the last 35 or so years, the doubling rate has<br>
varied between one year and two years, with 18 months a decent long-term<br>
estimate.  I believe the "law" was originally stated as every year, because<br>
it was doing just that for several years in the 60's.  It was revised to 18<br>
months in the late 60's.  The 70's and 80's had several periods of about 2<br>
years, and at least once in the late 80's Moore changed it to every two<br>
years.  Now, I think, it's around 18 months again.  <br>
<p>
Moore himself is quite upfront that it's an empirical observation and has<br>
varied over the time period.  In Wired recently he said that the law will<br>
probably hold for another 10-12 years but doubts that it will hold beyond<br>
that.  Beyond that, we will have to move to a radically different system than<br>
wiring and transistors photographically etched on silicon.  There's no<br>
particular reason that this other technology (which might not exist then)<br>
will have the same emergent phenomena as current chip technology.<br>
