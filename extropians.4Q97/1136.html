      Have a look at Chris R. Tame's superb analysis of 'The Prisoner',<br>
      originally published in Samuel E. Konkin III's 'New Libertarian', <br>
      and re-published as a reprint by the Libertarian Alliance.  Chris is<br>
      hereabouts on the Extropians List.<br>
<p>
      'The Prisoner' was conceived by George Markstein [MI6], and <br>
      exemplifies the conflict between the foreign-intelligence mindset, <br>
      which encounters the State as obstacle/target/mortal enemy, and the <br>
      internal-security types, who see 'defending the status quo' as<br>
      the primary objective.  MI5 exists to prevent _any_ kind of radical<br>
      change in the 'United Kingdom.'  No wonder Russell got excluded!<br>
      <br>
      In the US, it's the FBI.  Look at the way that notorious <br>
      serial-killer J. Edgar Hoover murdered, tormented and destroyed <br>
      radicals of every kind.  Frances Farmer, Jean Seberg,<br>
      anarchists, individualists, the list goes on and on and on...<br>
      <br>
      The FBI is an _appalling idea_ -- combining counter-espionage and<br>
      policing functions was the structural basis of the Nazi and Soviet<br>
      States.  Inevitably, they start thinking 'we know better than the<br>
      politicians', then they cease to 'serve' and instead aspire to rule.<br>
<p>
      <br>
      Hoover had _vast_ media and political 'assets' to work his fell will.<br>
      Ferinstance; Nixon ('Emperor Palpatine') was his creature.  Ditto <br>
      half the 'Republican' Party.  He hated CIA, as a rival to his <br>
      Sauron-like power-grabbing.  Howard Hunt said there were two kinds <br>
      of people he'd never met in 20 years in CIA; one was an assassin; <br>
      the other was a fellow-Republican!  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
      (Hunt designed the 'Watergate' scam to bring down Nixon, BTW.  Yo!).<br>
