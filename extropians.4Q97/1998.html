A couple of notes on my own earlier post regarding the "Asian Tigers".  Local<br>
elections in Taiwan have just yielded the result of fairly massive rejection<br>
of the Kuomintang party and, as a friend of mine has correctly pointed out<br>
off-list, Korea is currently undergoing what appear to be fairly "real"<br>
anticorruption trials pointed at members of the existing power structure.<br>
<p>
With these points in mind, I should have said that the fact that it has taken<br>
so long bears out my thesis.  I don't think that the idea of "Confucian<br>
Capitalism" is some sort of cultural monolith.  I just worry about capitalism<br>
without concommitant values of individual liberty and responsibility.  All<br>
I'm really saying is that capitalism with too great a stress on<br>
authoritarianism and orthodoxy seems like a weird and possibly bad mutation.<br>
 The outcome of the public corruption trials underway now in Korea will be<br>
very important for Korea's and Asia's future.  Assuming their polity comes<br>
out the other side of the current crises as an intact democracy, that might<br>
be just the rite of passage they need.<br>
<p>
With it's concentration of wealth and talent, Singapore is definitely a place<br>
to watch.  A question I'll be asking over the next decade is the extent to<br>
which Singapore remains "Chinese" culturaly.  The very explictly Confucian<br>
regime of Lee Kuan Yew might give way to a much more culturally diverse<br>
environment there that could become a laboratory of 21st century<br>
technological society.<br>
