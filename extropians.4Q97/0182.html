OK, Keith, when reading your post I turned red...Please forgive me! I thi=<br>
nk<br>
"barter" is the correct term, isn't it ? The other thing which annoys me<br>
are the "=3D" in my texts. I'll therefore stop to post to the list (but<br>
continue to read carefully) until this technical problem is over, which<br>
means, I'm afraid, changing my provider...<br>
<p>
Now for Guru Georges:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, free software transactions occur in the context of a fully</i><br>
<i>&gt;functioning economic system: I don't see how they could occur without</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.  =</i><br>
<p>
<p>
As I said earlier, we are in a game of Go. Various economical systems<br>
compete and collaborate simultaneously. The fact, (as Michael also pointe=<br>
d<br>
out) that "Free software" occurs inside a capitalist system, and is even<br>
used by corporations, does not means that it does not exist. The fact tha=<br>
t,<br>
AFAIK, most right anarchists are against the copyright system proves that=<br>
<p>
we agree at least on this point. =<br>
<p>
The idea to see the environment as an agent is largely inspired by Gregor=<br>
y<br>
Bateson's definition of "Mind" and Lovelock's theories about Gaia (please=<br>
<p>
do not confuse with New Age stuff). Every system which has the ability to=<br>
<p>
process information,  can be seen as an "agent". Ecosystems or human<br>
societies pertain, IMHO, to this category.<br>
I agree with you, this kind of anarchy would be difficult in the present<br>
day. (that's why I =<br>
<p>
think it's useless to search examples of anarchy in past or primitive<br>
societies). Of course, I'm myself very skeptical about right anarchy!<br>
 But nanotechnology, or robotics, will probably create easily "public<br>
domain" material goods...what is, therefore, the usefulness of the proper=<br>
ty<br>
concept in a very technological society ?<br>
<p>
Bye (Cu when my "=3D" problem is solved)<br>
Remi<br>
