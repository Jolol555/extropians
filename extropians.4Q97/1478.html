<i>&gt; From:          Twink &lt;neptune@mars.superlink.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject:       Uplifting anyone?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since I am new to this list, I feel it might be better to start a thread, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; pickup with the current discussions.  I know many would be trans-</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanists are interested in uplifting -- i.e., making a nonsentient species</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentient.  I am too.  (I know there must be stuff/web pages out there on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this already, so forgive any redundancies.  And point them out to me!:)</i><br>
<p>
Before embarking on this project, it might be wise to consider what <br>
species are the most likely candidates for sentience -- including the <br>
possibility that some already ARE sentient.<br>
<p>
That I am aware of, the most likely candidates are:<br>
<p>
Terrestrial:<br>
<p>
Primates: the mountain chimpanzee, other chimpanzees, gorillas, other <br>
great apes (in approximate order of likelihood)<br>
<p>
Elephants: the Indian species is the most likely, the two African <br>
species less likely<br>
<p>
Aquatic:<br>
<p>
Delphinae: all species I'm aware of, with the orca and the <br>
bottlenose being the most likely<br>
<p>
Cetacea: most or all species, with the sperm whale being perhaps the <br>
most likely<br>
<p>
Cephalopoda: the Pacific giant octopus is a quite likely possibility. <br>
 Other varieties of octopus may be candidates.  The giant squid is <br>
technically a possibility but presents certain practical challenges <br>
(e.g. that it's a deep sea creature, we have never encountered a <br>
healthy one except perhaps in brief meetings, and we know they are <br>
*extremely* large).<br>
<p>
Avian: with our current understanding of how brains work, it seems <br>
unlikely that a flying creature on this planet could bear the weight <br>
of a brain capable of sentience.  The flightless avians also do not <br>
look at all promising.<br>
