<i>&gt;I've been on the list since it's inception and managed it for</i><br>
<i>&gt;sometime. I don't accept the view of a "quagmire of internal turmoil."</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Institute is self has never been been healthier, stronger or more</i><br>
<i>&gt;effective.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The list only reflects those who are on it and the many roles that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;serves and there are many. There are many easy ways to improve the</i><br>
<i>&gt;list's S/N. Here is one: hire a few Phd's to screen each post and</i><br>
<i>&gt;charge enough for the list to cover that cost.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Given the clear goal that the list should be effective for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;institute w/out taking resources away from it my previous suggestion</i><br>
<i>&gt;is clearly not a good one. Nor would be in the inverse which would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;to allow anyone to post on any topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Given that some middle ground must be met and that those involved are</i><br>
<i>&gt;smart, well spoken and sometimes aggressive people with differing</i><br>
<i>&gt;views you can see that any changes to the list and the list it self</i><br>
<i>&gt;can bring conflict.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If there is any Quagmire it's that there isn't a separate list for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;meta discussion of the list and that those who want basic list</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources have no way to avoid the "good fight about the list"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yours,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

"Young" Extropians  may not begin its grown with the same errors than<br>
"extinct" (?) Nazis...  <br>
<p>
Does anybody know what means "DEMOCRACY IN ACTION" ???<br>
<p>
Just read above...<br>
<p>
Gomes.<br>

PS: Closing the list is completely different from admitting the necessity of<br>
creating a more silent room to provide a better environment to discuss<br>
really important subjects... But what makes someone  think  this can be got<br>
by paying money for it ??<br>
<p>
So:&gt;&gt;&gt; Create another list: the "Silent room"... but include invited serious<br>
people... not just those who will pay for it... If you do not take care,<br>
this will be a perfect occasion for "Little Dollies" show their butts a<br>
little more... But... and about the brains ??? ( with lots of exceptions,<br>
obviously...)<br>
