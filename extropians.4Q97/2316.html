Science fact: Scientists achieve 'Star Trek'-like feat<br>
<p>

NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have pulled off a startling <br>
trick that looks like the "Beam-me-up, Scotty" <br>
technology of science fiction. <br>
<p>
In an Austrian laboratory, scientists destroyed bits of light <br>
in one place and made perfect replicas appear about three<br>
 feet away. <br>
<p>
They did that by transferring information about a crucial<br>
physical characteristic of the original light bits, called photons.<br>
The information was picked up by other photons, which took<br>
on that characteristic and so became replicas of the originals. <br>
<p>
The phenomenon that made it happen is so bizarre that even<br>
Albert Einstein didn't believe in it. He called it spooky. <br>
<p>
In addition to raising the rather fantastic notion of a new means of<br>
transportation, the trick could lead to ultra-fast computers. <br>
<p>
The experiment is reported in Thursday's issue of the journal<br>
Nature by Anton Zeilinger and colleagues at the University of<br>
Innsbruck in Austria. Another research team, based in Rome,<br>
has done similar work and submitted its report to another journal. <br>
<p>
The work is the first to demonstrate "quantum teleportation," <br>
a bizarre shifting of physical characteristics between nature's<br>
tiniest particles, no matter how far apart they are. <br>
<p>
Scientists might be able to achieve teleportation between atoms <br>
within a few years and molecules within a decade or so, Zeilinger said. <br>
<p>
The underlying principle is fundamentally different from the "Star Trek" <br>
process of beaming people around, but could teleportation be used on<br>
people? Could scientists extract information from every tiny particle in a<br>
person, transfer it to a bunch of particles elsewhere, and assemble those<br>
particles into an exact replica of the person? <br>
<p>
There's no theoretical problem with that, several experts said. <br>
But get real. <br>
<p>
"I think it's quite clear that anything approximating teleportation <br>
of complex living beings, even bacteria, is so far away technologically<br>
 that it's not really worth thinking about it," said IBM physicist Charles<br>
H. Bennett. He and other physicists proposed quantum teleportation in 1993.<br>
<p>
<p>
There would just be too much information to assemble and transmit,<br>
they say. Even if it were possible someday, it would be so <br>
expensive that "probably it's just as cheap to send the real person,"<br>
said Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. <br>
<p>
Besides, Schumacher said, teleportation would "kill you and take<br>
you apart atom by atom so you could be reassembled at the other<br>
end, one hopes. It doesn't seem like a good idea to me." <br>
<p>
Much more likely, experts said, is using teleportation between <br>
tiny particles to set up quantum computers. These devices would use<br>
teleportation to sling data around, and they could solve certain complex<br>
problems much faster than today's machines. <br>
<p>
In the new work, scientists transferred the trait of "polarization"<br>
between photons. Light behaves like both a photon particle and as <br>
a wave. A light wave has peaks and troughs like an ocean wave, and<br>
polarization refers to the directions in which these peaks and troughs <br>
point. Photons retain this trait. To transfer the polarization between <br>
photons, the researchers used a phenomenon called entanglement, <br>
which a disbelieving Einstein derided. Since then, however, it's been <br>
shown to be real. <br>
<p>
When two photons are entangled, "they have opposite luck," said <br>
IBM's Bennett. Whatever happens to one is the opposite of what <br>
happens to the other. In particular, their polarizations are the opposite <br>
of each other. <br>
<p>
Here's how the Austrians took advantage of that: <br>
<p>
Call three photons A, B and C, and assume the goal is to transmit A's<br>
polarization to C. The researchers created B and C as entangled photons.<br>
Then they entangled B with A. <br>
<p>
That second step destroyed A, but not before B took on the opposite <br>
of A's original state. This change meant B's entangled partner, C, had to<br>
change polarization to remain the opposite of B's. So C's polarization <br>
ended up the same as A's used to be. The polarization was transmitted. <br>
<p>
The process worked only 25 percent of the time because of how the<br>
experiment was set up. It's possible to go to 75 percent and scientists <br>
will shoot for that, Zeilinger said. <br>
<p>
If the notion of entanglement leaves your head spinning, don't feel bad.<br>
Zeilinger said he doesn't understand how it works either. <br>
<p>
"And you can quote me on that," he said. <br>

I don't know if it's related precisely, but if one of<br>
you can find the time to explain me a bit more regarding<br>
this "scale", see also my last posting (picture of atom robot-arm)<br>
I would be very thankful.................<br>
