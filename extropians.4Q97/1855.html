<i>&gt;From: Michael M. Butler [SMTP:butler@comp*lib.org]</i><br>
<i>&gt;Having studied with one of the founders of the thing called NLP, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;having</i><br>
<i>&gt;observed various practitioners at close hand, permit me to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are downsides present for some practitioners. And some of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;practitioners are high-vis. :\</i><br>
<p>
Michael, I'd love to hear some of your overall impressions of NLP,<br>
particularly the evolutions of it over time and the manner by which<br>
Grinder et al go about exploring/inventing new techniques.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The last seminars I had with John Grinder and Judith Ann Delozier (as</i><br>
<i>&gt;best</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can recall, around 1990-1991) were very rewarding. At that time,</i><br>
their<br>
<i>&gt;area of concern and approach to models/metamodels was varieties of</i><br>
<i>&gt;focused</i><br>
<i>&gt;attention. I think you would have enjoyed it had you been present,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anders.</i><br>
<p>
Very interesting stuff indeed, from what little I've read.  I find it to<br>
be quite congruent with, and complementary to, the studies of focused<br>
attention one finds in the literature of meditation.  Particularly the<br>
concept found in Buddhist (vipasana) and Zen meditation of constant<br>
mindfulness or bare and precise attention at all moments of<br>
consciousness.  It seems to me (without having gone through a<br>
practitioner training myself) that the NLP focus on detailed observation<br>
could serve to develop these faculties.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the third tentacle, there has been a tendency for extravagant claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be made. I believe that some branch of the US military did some</i><br>
<i>&gt;investigation into the utility of some published/promoted NLP</i><br>
<i>&gt;techniques,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I doubt their applications and investigative methodology would</i><br>
<i>&gt;satisfy</i><br>
<i>&gt;you.</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, I'm interested in reading the results of even poor-methodology<br>
studies in the area.  Any references would be appreciated.<br>
<p>
