Someone said:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cars are polluting the environment but I wouldn't like</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to do without the freedom my car is delivering ! </i><br>
<p>
As I understand it, a majority of the pollution (carbon monoxide,<br>
anyway) comes from a small minority of gross-polluting cars. The<br>
dirtiest 10% of cars emit 50% of the carbon monoxide, while the cleanest<br>
50% of autos emit only 5%. <br>
<p>
And, apparently, maintenance is more important than age when it comes to<br>
emission levels. About two-thirds of cars that fail exhaust tests have<br>
emission-control systems out of conformance with the law, and a majority<br>
of those had been deliberately tampered with. If tampering is widespread<br>
and causes high emissions, then a scheduled emissions inspection every<br>
year is a waste of time and money.<br>
<p>
It would be like fighting drunk driving by having annual breathalyzer<br>
tests-it won't be effective. Only random, spot testing will uncover<br>
these polluters.<br>
<p>
Technology can be used to target gross polluters. The technology is<br>
cheap and portable, thus capable of random surveillance while<br>
inconveniencing only those guilty. The Sun Company of Philadelphia used<br>
a remote-sensing device to spot pollution from passing vehicles. By<br>
beaming a ray of light across a city road, Sun was able to spot more<br>
than 3,400 vehicles out of 75,000 screened that were spewing fumes in<br>
excess of federal limits. Get those 5% of vehicles fixed and air quality<br>
will be much improved. We could target the guilty without<br>
inconveniencing the innocent.<br>
<p>
Random roadside vehicle testing, instead of requiring every motorist to<br>
spend time and money visiting another inspection station, seems like it<br>
might be practical and effective. <br>
<p>
Neuronaut &lt;lessismore@mwinger.batnet.com&gt; said:<br>
<i>&gt; The freedom one might experience from owning a car is</i><br>
<i>&gt; illusory what with the congestion, expense and worry that</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes with owning such an expensive item.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a personal decision.  Road owners (and adjacent property<br>
owners) should, however, be able to target gross polluters and hold them<br>
responsible for trespass, nuisance, etc.<br>
<p>
Also, our government should not subsidize the price of gasoline be<br>
defending perceived oil interests in dangerous areas of the world.  If a<br>
company decides to do business with a prince or dictator halfway around<br>
the globe let them pay for the security and transportation safety, and<br>
take the hit if it's nationalized, etc.  Also, the roads should be<br>
privatized.  Then perhaps alternative financing will eliminate the gas<br>
taxes that also distort the price.  The price of natural resources<br>
should reflect their true cost, and scarcity.  Then our decision of<br>
whether to own a car or not might be a more rational judgment, all<br>
things considered.<br>
