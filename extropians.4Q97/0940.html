<i>&gt; This is different; I'm saying that even with the key already in place at</i><br>
<i>&gt; both ends, you need either perfect information through the channel (in</i><br>
<i>&gt; both time and frequency domains) or *some* redundancy/pattern, however</i><br>
<i>&gt; small; the latter permits you to resynchronize if that is needed.</i><br>
<p>
Surely the sync signal would not have to be perfectly hidden to be<br>
undetectable to us primitive apes?  And, it is not actually needed, the<br>
other method to recover the clock is brute computing force and a very<br>
stable local clock.  Just decode the signal using the key with all<br>
possible sync timings, and when you find the correct timing, use from then<br>
on.  Or, be listening when the signal is first turned on.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another problem is that (I think) you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to be able to _resolve_ time to the granularity of the symbol rate.</i><br>
<p>
This is, if I understand you, the main reason that I think an advanced <br>
transmission would be invisible to us at our present state of <br>
technology.  See my prevoius post re: modulation bandwidth possible with <br>
light -vs- current technolody.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and I think the proposition is impossible to falsify, and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a bull session topic than something to take action regarding: "What if</i><br>
This IS a bull session, no?  After all, we are talking about advanced <br>
extraterrestrial data transmissions!  Impossible to prove or falsify, but <br>
what fun!<br>
