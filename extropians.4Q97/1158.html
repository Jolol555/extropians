John Clark writes<br>
: Cantor's crowning achievement was when he proved something we now call<br>
: Cantor's Theorem, it states that if B is any cardinal number then B &lt;<br>
: 2^B. This means there are an infinite number of cardinal numbers, an<br>
: infinite number of different infinities.  However he was not able to<br>
: figure out if there is an infinite number between the number of integers<br>
: and the number of points on a line, and even today it is not known.<br>
<p>
Isn't that the "Continuum Hypothesis", which has been proven<br>
unprovable either way?  So it's an arbitrary choice of axiom.<br>
<p>
Kennita asks<br>
: By this do you mean that there are B integers and 2^B points on a line,<br>
: and we don't know if there's anything in between?<br>
<p>
Yes, if B = aleph-null.  Think of the set of real numbers (points<br>
on a line) as expressed in binary: B bits running to the left, B bits<br>
running to the right, thus the members of the set are 2^B.  Cantor<br>
used a charming trick to show that this set is non-countable, i.e.<br>
cannot be mapped one-to-one with the set of integers.<br>
