<p>
Could you please cite these policies and explain how they kept oil<br>
prices "higher than they should have been"?  Then explain why the<br>
US has the cheapest oil prices in the world?  As far as I understand<br>
it, the oil industry in the US receives tens of billions of dollars per<br>
year in direct and indirect subsidies from the US taxpayer.  Here's<br>
a quote from <a href="http://www.wallowa.com/kerr/kerr9.htm:">http://www.wallowa.com/kerr/kerr9.htm:</a><br>
<p>
}Most industrialized nations heavily tax petroleum because government<br>
}spend lots of money keeping the oil flowing and cleaning up the messes<br>
}caused by oil. But not in the USA where income and property taxpayers<br>
}pay through the nose since the tax on gasoline doesn't come close to<br>
}covering the costs<br>
}<br>
}The Institute for Local Self Reliance has issued "Oil Slickers: How<br>
}Petroleum Benefits at the Taxpayer's Expense" (www.ilsr.com or $10<br>
}from 1313 5th St. SE, Suite 306 Minneapolis, MN 55414), a compelling<br>
}analysis of the hidden costs of oil.<br>
}<br>
}Economists call them "externalities." They are costs that are<br>
}reflected in the price of product. For example, all the damages caused<br>
}by cigarettes isn't paid for by the tax on a pack of cigarettes.<br>
}<br>
}ISLR estimates that the additional costs in tax subsidies, military<br>
}protection, and environmental and human health costs is between $42<br>
}and $350 billion annually. (The range is so wide because it depends on<br>
}what and how you count.) For perspective, the federal governments<br>
}deficit this year is less than $200 billion.<br>
}<br>
}First is the $3.3 to $10.9 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies.<br>
}They have convinced Congress to grant them a whole list of tax<br>
}subsidies from the oil depletion allowance to accelerated depreciation<br>
}and a bunch of other breaks given to no other industry. The statutory<br>
}rate of taxation for American business is 35% before deductions. The<br>
}oil companies pay about 11%. Most other industries are much closer to<br>
}35%. Taxes that the oil companies don't pay means that other<br>
}taxpayers---or our grandchildren in the form of debt---do pay.<br>
}<br>
}It's not just federal taxes that are being tapped to meet our<br>
}petroleum addiction, but also local property taxes. ISLR estimated<br>
}that if the transportation taxes paid it's full freight in<br>
}Minneapolis, rather than some of the burden being paid by property<br>
}taxes, gasoline would cost another 18 cents/gallon.<br>
}<br>
}Second, taxpayers spend $26.6 to $70.7 billion to pay for military<br>
}protection in the Middle East and elsewhere. This figure is in<br>
}dollars, not in American blood (and health) that was lost in Oil War I<br>
}(you may remember it as the Gulf War) or could be lost in the upcoming<br>
}Oil War II.<br>
}<br>
}One Defense Department official recently told Congress that the last<br>
}war in 1991 might keep things quiet for 10 years.<br>
}<br>
}Third, and the hardest to quantify precisely-but likely the most<br>
}expensive of all-is the estimated $25.5 to $267 billion annual costs<br>
}in the form of environmental and health costs associated with<br>
}pollution...<br>
<p>
He goes on to interpret this data in ways I don't agree with, but up<br>
to this point his "facts" jive with what I've heard elsewhere.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, Americans should be the last people on earth to be<br>
complaining about the price of oil.  What you *should* be doing<br>
is complaining about billions of your tax dollars subsidizing it's<br>
price.<br>
