somebody wrote<br>
:  &gt; Newton says an object moving in a circle is accelerating toward the<br>
:  &gt; center of the circle. Maxwell says an accelerating charge will radiate<br>
:  &gt; an electromagnetic wave and give up energy. BUT...<br>
:  &gt;<br>
:  &gt; An electron is a charge. The electron does not usually radiate an<br>
:  &gt; electromagnetic wave. The electron does not give up energy. The electron<br>
:  &gt; does  not spiral into the nucleus.<br>
<p>
danny explained:<br>
: I think he meant that the object would have to be going "towards" the<br>
: center so as not to fly off its orbit, it doesnt mean that it gets any<br>
: closer to the center though.<br>
<p>
What's your point, danny?  Is the electron accelerating, or not?<br>
If it is accelerating, then it ought to release energy, or Maxwell's<br>
theory is wrong (and radios don't work...).  But if it releases energy, <br>
the energy must come from somewhere.  Where?  From the electron itself?  <br>
But that would mean the electron's mass decreases, and it's well known <br>
that all electrons have the same mass.  From the electron's orbit?  But <br>
electrons don't fall into the nucleus.  From elsewhere?<br>
<p>
A charged particle circling in a cyclotron does release energy<br>
(called synchrotron radiation), and its orbit does change.<br>
