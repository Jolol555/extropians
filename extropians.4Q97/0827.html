By your own admission (read above), the way the plates fit together have no<br>
relation to the surface area.  By extremely simple geometric principles,<br>
this also means that the SIZE of the earth has no relation to the way the<br>
plates fit together.  You can't have one without the other.  In fact, what<br>
you are proposing doesn't really make much sense geometrically.<br>
Free-floating plates (e.g. plate tectonics) will fit together<br>
*irregardless* of any expansion or compression because all the components<br>
are multiplied by the same growth factor in all dimensions.  And this is<br>
true whether or not the continents change size as the Earth changes size.<br>
<p>
If you draw the continents on a balloon, they fit together equally well<br>
whether the balloon is half-inflated or fully inflated.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;your cereal settles down in the box over time)</i><br>

<i>&gt;This is your opinion, you dont know how the inner core/mantle relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt;works.  Havent you ever heard of an expanding sun?  Things expand when they</i><br>
<i>&gt;cool.  Anyway, this is just a theory to back up the fact that the earth was</i><br>
<i>&gt;smaller a long time ago.  So, doesnt it seem obvious that the core is</i><br>
<i>&gt;expanding into the mantle?  The core is 3 times denser than the mantle.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;say that the mantle flows in and out of the core, which of course you dont</i><br>
<i>&gt;know for sure, but if this is true, at the same time couldnt less and less</i><br>
<i>&gt;mantle be flowing back into the core?  Think yourself!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
First, an expanding sun is irrelevant to the mechanics of a large, solid<br>
planetary object.  Apples and oranges. <br>
<p>
Secondly, your "possible" explanation of the mantle/core system violates<br>
several basic principles of mechanics and thermodynamics.  I strongly<br>
recommend that make the effort to educate yourself in such areas as simple<br>
mechanics (Newtonian physics) and thermodynamics.  A strong foundation in<br>
these subjects will go a long way towards immunizing yourself against the<br>
plethora of pseudo-science proponents in the world.  When addressing an<br>
audience such as this, it is best to have at least a basic understanding of<br>
the science that you are preaching, since the audience most surely does.<br>
