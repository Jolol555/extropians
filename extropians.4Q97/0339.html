: 'Demonstration Killing' of JonBenet Ramsey last week -- prima facie a<br>
:  clear case of authoritarian right-wing terrorism directed against the<br>
:  child beauty pageants and their participants -- children and parents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh, is that what it's about.  You've been alluding elliptically</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the "demonstration killing of JonBenet Ramsey" for months now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and this is the first time you've mentioned a motive.</i><br>
<p>
I was not able to discuss the case in overmuch detail before now, for <br>
several reasons.<br>
<p>
    In the Italian 'Strategy of Tension', elements in the laughably-misnamed <br>
'Security Services' (who have always tended to cease to serve, while <br>
aspiring to rule -- "We know best, for your own good' sort of thing), <br>
organized massive and lethal provocations on both 'Left' (Brigate Rossi) <br>
_and_ Right (Stefano Delle Chiae and the Black Terrorists).<br>
<p>
    See Stuart Christie's biagraphy of Delle Chiae, 'Portrait of a Black <br>
Terrorist.'   Stuart went on to edit 'Arguments and Facts International' <br>
during the Gorbachev period -- quite a coup for a British anarchist who <br>
made a good-faith attempt to blow up General Franco.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
    These incidents were aimed at "Intoxication" of the Italian populace, <br>
so that they would become frightened and insecure, and accept the <br>
abandonment of liberal democracy for authoritarian rule and 'crack-downs.'<br>
<p>
    We had the same problem here in Britain, on a lesser scale: Brian <br>
Micklethwait actually _welcomed_ it, if it helped Thatcherites 'smash' the <br>
'enemy' (i.e. people who disagreed with Micklethwait about anything).  <br>
"Power corrupts' indeed...<br>
<p>
:      If you _really_ want to protect children from _real harm_, why not<br>
:      campaign for radio alarms?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because it's not a prosecutor's job?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Must *every* concerned person campaign on *every* front at once?</i><br>
<p>
He could be very effective, arguing for _real_ child protection -- <br>
assuming he really wants to protect children, that is...<br>
<p>
:    Here in the UK, we are steadily uncovering a quite hideous catalogue<br>
:    of violent and forcible sexual abuses in official State-run<br>
:    'childrens' homes', with the children all too often being used _for<br>
:    years_ to 'service' the sadistic urges of rich and/or powerful<br>
:    authoritarian people.<br>
:<br>
:    People rather like you, perhaps?  Who seek male or female prey to<br>
:    torment and deride? (Ref: Eric Berne, MD., "The Little Fascist" in<br>
:    "What Do You Say After You Say 'Hello'?").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tony, friend, you're acting like a crank.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can you point to any connection between this prosecutor</i><br>
<i>&gt; and any "children's home"?</i><br>
<p>
A crank converts reciprocation to rotation, as every fule kno.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
Oh, sure I can show a connection.  Parts of Washington State's 'child <br>
protection' industry has a horrifying reputation in Seattle and elsewhere <br>
in Washington State. The 'childrens' homes' get the children by taking <br>
them away from their parents.  Why do bank tobbers rob banks?  Because <br>
'that's where the money is.'  Think about it.<br>
<p>
<p>
BTW: The current -- professional -- diagnosis of my mental state is:<br>
<p>
     "Really nice person.<br>
<p>
      Brilliantly intelligent.<br>
<p>
      Perfectly sane.<br>
<p>
      Under great stress.<br>
<p>
      Needs more sleep.<br>
<p>
      Experiences Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."<br>
<p>
<p>
      I prefer that to 'acting like a crank', I'd guess.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
:    Then go rent "STAR TREK - The Movie" [1980].<br>
:    Think awhile.  Then go watch John Carpenter's 'Christine" [1983]<br>
:    Then -- at last -- you-all might just _begin_ to understand.<br>
<p>
