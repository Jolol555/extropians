<p>
This is a good explanation.  My objection to transporters is that I may<br>
go through one, like Dup1, and never be able to know if Dup2 had been<br>
created.  Is it OK to kill me?  I would say no, because I do not want to<br>
experience death.  The existance of Dup2 does not influence my decision.<br>
<p>
More important than the question "Is Dup2 me?", is my assertion that the<br>
original ME is still me.  I object to most uploading theories, even the<br>
ones that replace my neurons one at a time very slowly.  They require<br>
the ability to create a complete duplicate and functional copy of my<br>
brain, even if that brain is dissassembled as individual neurons.  If<br>
such a copy can or has been made, then there would be or could be two<br>
copies of me.  Destroying the original and ending up with only one copy<br>
strongly implies that there has been a death of one individual, namely<br>
ME, the original.<br>
<p>
I am still wrestling with the ideas of uploading and/or duplication. <br>
Any scheme that requires the destruction of my original copy to prevent<br>
it from living beyond the time that the duplicate is created, is not<br>
acceptable to me.  Even if the original brain is deconstructed slowly<br>
while the new brain is constructed does not alleviate my concerns.<br>
<p>
I think the question of whether the new copy is "ME" is just semantics. <br>
I don't care about definitions or logical debate (except that it's<br>
fun!).  I want to avoid the experience of death and the cessation of<br>
experience.  No matter how many similar units continue to experience,<br>
*I* want to continue from my subjective viewpoint as well.<br>
