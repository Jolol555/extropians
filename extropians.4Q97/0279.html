I enjoyed Greg's two substantial posts very much, and found myself largely<br>
in agreement. I would go further though. Greg seems to suggest that<br>
morality or values can only be objective (or rational) given a desire to<br>
live in society. I am equally sure that certain virtues of character and<br>
moral principles can be shown objectively correct or rationally defensible<br>
even if you are living alone on a desert island. Here the minimal<br>
assumption is that you want to live and to be happy. (If you don't want<br>
anything then no morality can get a grip.) Given this trivial condition, we<br>
can rationally derive virtues, values, and principles such as persistence,<br>
patience, courage, reason, and alertness (for example). Under practically<br>
any conditions you can imagine, these characteristics WILL increase your<br>
chances of surviving and increasing your happiness.<br>
<p>
As I have said before (in the debate with Rich Artym that Greg mentioned) I<br>
prefer to speak of "rational values" rather than "objective morality". The<br>
latter can be confused with an absolute morality. I take it that Eliezer is<br>
suggesting that kind of view, though I regret that I haven't had the time<br>
to study all the posts to be sure. An absolute morality does not refer the<br>
actual conditions of life and to the nature of the living being. A rational<br>
morality does. A rational morality starts from the minimal assumption that<br>
a person wants to live, and to live successfully. Given those basic<br>
assumptions (which allow the is-ought barrier to be bridged), certain<br>
characteristics, principles, and values can be shown to work better than<br>
others. That's the sense in which they are rational.<br>
<p>
It does not follow that ALL values are rational. Only those that make a<br>
real difference to survival and happiness count as moral values. Trivial<br>
preference -- matters of taste -- generally are arbitrary. Of course<br>
difficult questions arise over where to draw the line between moral values<br>
and matters of taste. But the existence of twilight does not cast doubt on<br>
the existence of night and day.<br>
<p>
I suspect that there would be vastly less disagreement over morality if we<br>
could eliminate other rationally indefensible ideas and beliefs, such as<br>
those found in religions. We would still have differences of view in how<br>
human psychology operates (affecting our views about what brings happiness)<br>
and about social mechanisms, but many silly moral views would disappear.<br>
