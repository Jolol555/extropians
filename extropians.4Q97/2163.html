<i>&gt; &gt;If we want to discuss our ideas with others who strongly disagree,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there's a forum for that, too: it's called Usenet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(Look for me on dejanews)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I disagree is with your "argument" that because you have money you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; an extropian and can join the list while I can't. The simple fact that you </i><br>
<i>&gt; have money - 95$ - to spend makes you nothing better than anyone else in </i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing any issue in the world. And since basically that's what you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to do, I'm expressing my disagreement. All I said was as simple as </i><br>
<i>&gt; that, I disagree with prejudices based on wealth! I disagree when you say </i><br>
<i>&gt; that you are more "qualified" to discuss extropianism because you have more </i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth!</i><br>
<p>
The issue here is how ExI's spends its resources here.  Respecting<br>
private property is not discrimination based on wealth--it's ordinary<br>
human decency.  Whether or not you have $95 doesn't make me believe<br>
you are any better or worse of a person by itself--but if I'm offering<br>
something /I own/ for that price, if you don't have the money you don't<br>
get my goods.  That's not discrimination, that's just business, and the<br>
only alternative to that is theft.<br>
<p>
That having been said, even if there /is/ wealth-based prejudice in<br>
some minds, I think that's quite a fair and valuable prejudice, and<br>
discriminating on those grounds is not entirely irrational.  In earlier<br>
times when wealth was amassed through aristocracy, slavery, conquest,<br>
and other unpleasant means, one might have been justified in<br>
discriminating /against/ the wealthy like Jesus did ("It is harder<br>
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man<br>
to enter the kingdom of heaven"), and maybe even in some societies<br>
today with corrupt systems of government and business, wealth might<br>
correlate strongly with moral depravity.  But in the developed world<br>
today, the greater number of transactions between humans that are<br>
voluntary, the more likely wealth is to correlate with cooperation<br>
and doing valuable service to others.  Since earning a living by<br>
free trade is the most socially responsible act one can perform,<br>
choosing to associate with those who do so is quite rational.  If by<br>
doing so I miss out on the occasional interesting poor person, well<br>
that's my loss, but I don't have time in my life to accomplish<br>
anything without having prejudices--it's just not possible.<br>
