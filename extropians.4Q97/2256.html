Concerning Chicago/Midwest Extropians, Michael<br>

"Depending on the response to this gathering, we may<br>
have to reserve something(??) (I'm new to<br>
get-together planning business)."<br>
<p>
I'm not so new at it, and I doubt we'll have that<br>
sort of problem at this point. Rather, I'm concerned<br>
that the response will be insufficient for us to<br>
gather as early as January. (By insufficent, I mean<br>
less than four people saying they'll be there. I<br>
certainly wouldn't recommend travelling all the way<br>
up here just to meet little old me.)<br>
<p>
Let's give it a several more days before reacting.<br>
Also, if the response is insufficient at this point<br>
to gather in January, let's not give up. Some things<br>
take time.<br>
<p>
Getting organized extropian activity in Chicago and<br>
the Midwest going may unfortunately require more than<br>
just posts in this list. Perhaps not as many people<br>
in Chicago read the Wired article.... I know there<br>
are a lot of people in Chicago with extropian<br>
tendencies, but they may never have heard the word<br>
"extropy". To generalize, while there are some<br>
cultural differences between greater LA (for<br>
example)and Chicagoland*, these are so slight as to<br>
be negligible to a first approximation.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I expect we'll be starting pretty small.<br>
<p>
*By the way, Michael, are you originally from<br>
Chicago? I thought only Chicagoans used the term<br>
"Chicagoland". I once used the term as nearby as<br>
Milwaukee, and was met with noncomprehension. They<br>
thought I was talking about a theme park or<br>
something...<br>
