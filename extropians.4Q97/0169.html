<i>&gt; &gt;To some extent, Microsoft's dominance derives from their illegal and unlawful</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;theft of intellectual property.  Even if intellectual property should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;abolished, as Lee advocates, Microsoft's competitors couldn't use Microsoft's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intellectual property,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh?  Can you explain this last part?  If Int.Prop. was abolished, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; would MS's Int.Prop. *be*, and why couldn't someone else use it??</i><br>
<p>
Eli has a good point, though he's a bit scattered in expressing it.<br>
Microsoft has used existing intellectual property law to protect its<br>
market, while at the same time taking advantage of holes in the law<br>
to use the ideas of others.<br>
<p>
On the whole, I do not think that intellectual property protection<br>
was really necessary or even beneficial to MS on the whole; in fact,<br>
I'm sure they lost more money because of it than they made.  But it<br>
is nonetheless hypocritical of them to play both sides.  If they<br>
believe, as I do, that intellectual property is just a government<br>
subsidizing the cost of exclusion for one type of business over<br>
another, then they should refrain from using it for themselves.<br>
<p>
The cost of exclusion is an ordinary expense for any business; there<br>
is no reason that authors and inventors should be privileged to have<br>
the state bear those costs for them.  That's nothing but snobbery,<br>
treating inventors as if they are somehow more "worthy" than ordinary<br>
craftsmen.  The result is plain: the decline of craftsmanship and<br>
customer service in the last century is the result of IP law shifting<br>
the economy to artificially value innovation over quality.<br>
