[Snipped good examples] <br>
The Key is that these bounds are based on our deepest understanding,<br>
not in the understanding of the superintelligences. If thg SIs can<br>
figure out way around the constraint we see then all bets are off.<br>
I personally don't concern myself with new laws of physics until<br>
I see some compelling experimental evidence, but I'm not an SI, so<br>
I cannot begin to design the relevant experiments. I'll restrict myself<br>
to helping to build the SI. What new physics might our hypothetical<br>
SI find? well consult any good scienc fiction collection. The current<br>
universe may not be the only accessible universe, as a sufficient<br>
example.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaotic Computability Constraints:  The most ambitious nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My understanding may be off here, but let me put forth the reason I see</i><br>
<i>&gt; chaotic computability entering into the picture with nanotech:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[SNIP of simple STM]<br>
<i>&gt; PARALLEL NANOTECH</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's use "Parallel Nanotech" to describe the use of a swarm of</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-reproducing assemblers to transform the source material into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; desired object(s).  Possibly this can be handled without worrying about</i><br>
<i>&gt; chaos, though I'm not sure.  The question here is what control system is</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to distribute instructions to the appropriate assembler at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate time.  There are several options in this area, divisible</i><br>
<i>&gt; into two groups:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Group 1) Control systems requiring central planning and coordination of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the assemblers.  Ie, with electromagnetic signals of some sort I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate to each nanite and instruct it in what to do.  Or I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; "draw" the shape of the object I wanted and have different classes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanites respond to different signals (which correspond to different</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas).  This requires external planning, analysis of the source</i><br>
<i>&gt; material, and either precise regulation of the source quality and</i><br>
<i>&gt; structure, or on-the-fly recalibration of the output material.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; type of control seems to avoid the chaotic computability problems but is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a much less flexible nanotech than is popularly conceived by nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; proponents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[SNIP of much more complex systems requireing serious autonomy]<br>
<p>
A distributed system can consistently build a fixed design to atomic<br>
precision if the design is hierarchical. Such a strategy may not be<br>
consistent with the wilder nanotech scenarios, but i should more than<br>
suffice to build replacements for all of the hard goods that comnprise<br>
the current basis of the economy, and to build truly massive computers.<br>
IMO this is far more than enough to obsolete the current economic<br>
system and provide the computation basis for the SI. Stochastic<br>
assembly and other non-deterministic systems are unnecessary even<br>
though they may be interesting.<br>
<p>
A hierarchical system is describes at some length in Nanosystems.<br>
To summarize: specify a bunch of building blocks, and assemblers or<br>
"factories" to build them from atoms. Also specify next-level<br>
assemblers and/or factories to build next-level building blocks.<br>
Go as many levels as necessary.<br>
<p>
Sure, such a system is limited, but who cares? It's effectrively<br>
a great deal less limited than any current factory.<br>
