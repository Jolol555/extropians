Once in a while I find myself trying to explain to someone<br>
that the fact that they didn't adhere to some stupid rule<br>
of some stupid piece of technology<br>
(often stupid in a subtle way, like the fact that<br>
 the VCR must be OFF or it won't record X-Files tomorrow night,<br>
 or the way that Dilbert, intending to delete an embarrassing <br>
 phone message, instead sends it to all his coworkers),<br>
means the piece of technology is stupid,<br>
not them.<br>
<p>
Listen, it's a dribble glass.<br>
It's designed in such a way that it dribbles on you.<br>
<p>
"Yes, but I *knew* that."<br>
It's still a dribble glass.<br>
Dribble glasses work by fooling you into thinking they're something sensible,<br>
fooling you into doing something perfectly sensible with them,<br>
then doing something to you that *looks like* it was your fault.<br>
Hah, hah, you trusted me.<br>
<p>
"You'd think I would learn."<br>
The point is that this is a retrograde, damaging kind of "learning."<br>
It is unlearning the expectation of civilization--the expectation that<br>
people won't hand you a dribble glass.  We are in denial.  Instead of<br>
admitting the horrible truth that we are being handed dribble glasses<br>
left and right, we take the blame ourselves, eroding the idea that<br>
technology should not dribble on us, that it should be adapted to us.<br>
<p>
First maybe learn to be a human being,<br>
then, when you're done that, in your spare time,<br>
you might take up the hobby of learning <br>
   the obeisance before fetish-objects,<br>
   the nervous glance,<br>
   the stepping over cracks,<br>
   the counting to ten,<br>
   the throwing salt over your shoulder,<br>
   the obsessive triple-checking and hand-washing,<br>
   the knees-bent, arms-outstretched walk,<br>
   the saying-the-opposite-of-what-you-mean, but winking obscurely,<br>
in short the behaviors<br>
that are adapted to the fun house--or funny farm--around you.<br>
<p>
There is a moral point here.<br>
Acquiesce to barbarism implies support of barbarism.<br>
By saying "I should learn," one implies that<br>
we all should learn to adapt to bad designs,<br>
that it's okay for people to hand us dribble glasses.<br>
We shouldn't.  It ain't.<br>
<p>
It's okay, as a provisional, practical matter, to learn the ways<br>
of the idiotic mutant sheep-monkey some piece of equipment was designed for,<br>
but don't make it sound like a measure of a person.<br>
<p>
Measuring ourselves by dribble-glass standards is not a game I want to be<br>
included in, implicitly or not.<br>
