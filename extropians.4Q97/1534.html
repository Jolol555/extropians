<p>
Dear Alex,<br>
 You are your list may be interested to learn that my attack on Clinton's<br>
proposed ban on human cloning, WHO'S AFRAID OF HUMAN CLONING? is about to<br>
come out. It may be found on Amazon.com  or ordered at a 20% prepublication<br>
discount (off the $11 ppbk price) at 1-800-462-6420 from Rowman &amp;<br>
Littlefield publishers.<br>
<p>
The front matter for the book (Preface, Contents, etc) is below:<br>
<p>
<p>
Preface<br>
<p>
<p>
	At the end of June 1997, I had the opportunity to meet the man who<br>
cloned Dolly, Ian Wilmut, and to discuss with him some of the issues<br>
discussed in this book. Although he does not agree with my position on<br>
human cloning, I have been enriched by meeting Ian Wilmut.<br>
	The opportunity to meet Dr. Wilmut came at the first major<br>
conference on human cloning after the announcement of Dolly, and it was<br>
organized in Washington, D.C.,--by French Anderson, Art Caplan, Alex<br>
Capron, and Craig Venter-- to come just after the Report "Cloning Human<br>
Beings" was issued by the National Advisory Bioethics Commission (NBAC).<br>
Although I had already written over half of this book, this conference<br>
provided a great chance to improve it by meeting the leading people in the<br>
world in mammalian cloning, health law, genetic research, and bioethics. In<br>
addition, there were trademark attorneys and venture capitalists, experts<br>
in primate twinning, philosophy professors, and representatives of various<br>
religions. In short, it promised to be one of those extraordinarily<br>
exciting conferences in bioethics when the best people are pulled together<br>
to discuss a new development.<br>
	What was disappointing to me about the conference was that none of<br>
the speakers was willing to defend human cloning in any way. It seems that<br>
a consensus had developed among bioethicists, theologians, and scientists<br>
that this was a side not to be defended. In one of my only comments at this<br>
conference, I criticized the one-sidedness of the presentations and<br>
suggested that professionalism in bioethics meant that each side had to be<br>
defended with logic and passion, and that this had not been done. In reply,<br>
I was told that "perhaps a consensus has developed that human cloning<br>
should never be done and that is why only one side is represented."<br>
	But how can a "consensus" develop when the arguments are never<br>
made? When there is no discussion? No debate? I left disappointed.<br>
	There will be other books that discuss the events that led up to<br>
the cloning of Dolly and the reaction to that event.  Journalists will rush<br>
to get books out, and there will be a lot of quotations in them from<br>
various people about what human cloning means.<br>
	In contrast, this book is unabashedly philosophical and one-sided.<br>
I am making the case for human cloning first because there is a terrible<br>
one-sidedness to the "discussion" so far and second, because I believe that<br>
my position is true.<br>
<br>
Acknowledgments<br>
<p>
I owe many people for helping me to write this book and I wish to thank<br>
them here: Bob Blaylock, an editor at the Birmingham News, for getting me<br>
to write an Op-Ed on human cloning after the announcement of Dolly's birth;<br>
Rosemarie Tong and Lance Stell, for inviting me to Davidson College, where<br>
they and their students made several nice suggestions; microbiologist Susan<br>
Self, for inviting me to discuss human cloning in her honors seminar at<br>
UAB; the inaugural class of the executive masters' program in Health<br>
Administration, especially John Comstock, MD; the classes of 1999 and 2000<br>
of the UAB Medical School. Sarah Moyers at McGraw-Hill, for allowing me to<br>
delay the 3rd edition of Classic Cases in Medical Ethics; James Pittman,<br>
the former Dean of the UAB Medical School, for advice, encouragement, and a<br>
constant stream of sources; Stephen Jay Gould, whose visit to UAB in May<br>
and whose brief discussion of human cloning with me at dinner helped me to<br>
understand the importance of conjoined twins in this debate; Harold<br>
Kincaid, G. Lynn Stephens, Florence Siegal, and the perceptive students in<br>
my senior seminar and bioethics classes in the first half of 1997.<br>
Philosopher Richard Mohr made helpful suggestions about gay issues and<br>
cloning.<br>
	I also wish to thank the librarians at the Lister Hill Library for<br>
Medical Sciences and at the Sterne Library, especially Diann Weatherly. The<br>
financial support of the UAB Medical School allowed me to attend the first<br>
conference on the ethics of mammalian cloning, for which I am grateful.<br>
	Biologist Thanne Whibbels, Ona Marie Faye-Petersen of the<br>
Anatomical Pathology department and Jerry Thompson of Medical Genetics, all<br>
at UAB, reviewed various parts of the manuscript and answered my questions.<br>
UAB biologist Ann Cusick delayed packing for her trip to Alaska to make<br>
sure I understood embryology before she left. Mike Miller, while writing an<br>
honors thesis with me on human cloning, helped proofread this manuscript<br>
and gather sources for it.<br>
	 I owe a huge debt to my next-door neighbor, James Rachels, who<br>
read the manuscript and made many valuable suggestions about organization,<br>
arguments, ethical theory, and strategy. I am deeply in debt for his help<br>
and encouragement. Another colleague, Mary Whall, carefully read the entire<br>
manuscript shortly before it went to press, performing in a superogatory<br>
fashion and greatly improving the book. I am really in her debt,too. Robert<br>
Angus, who teaches various genetics courses at UAB, read key parts of the<br>
manuscript and corrected some of my mistakes (of course, what mistakes<br>
remain are mine alone). Sociologist Jay Hughes and an anonymous reviewer<br>
for Rowman &amp; Littlefield were ideal, constructive, informative reviewers.<br>
My wife Pat has also supported this book from the get-go, read and<br>
commented on parts of it, and I also thank her for tolerating my absences<br>
during the first three months when I was so immersed in the details of<br>
cloning.<br>
	Christa Davis Acampora, in her time as Philosophy Editor at Rowman<br>
&amp; Littlefield, and later her assistant, Robin Adler, were exceptionally<br>
helpful and enthusiastic about this project.<br>

Mary Had a Little Lamb<br>
<p>
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was slightly gray<br>
It didn't' have a father, just some borrowed DNA<br>
<p>
It sort of had a mother, though the ovum was on loan,<br>
It was not so much a lambkin as a little lamby clone<br>
<p>
And soon it had a fellow clone, and soon it had some more,<br>
They followed her to school one day, all cramming through the door.<br>
<p>
It made the children laugh and sing, the teachers found it droll,<br>
There were too many lamby clones, for Mary to control.<br>
<p>
No other could control the sheep, since the programs didn't vary<br>
So the scientists resolved it all, by simply cloning Mary.<br>
<p>
But now they feel quite sheepish, those scientists unwary,<br>
One problem solved but what to do, with Mary, Mary, Mary.<br>

suddenly at mid-life.  They will be missed by the entire bioethics<br>
community.<br>
