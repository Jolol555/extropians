Canada?  Well, I live here in fact.  Last month, a bunch of 13 year old<br>
girls broke another girl's legs with baseball bats (please note:<br>
baseball bats are sporting equipment, not weapons?) then threw her into a<br>
lake to drown in the small, peaceful town of Victoria, British Columbia.<br>
My point?  <br>
<p>
a) Anything can be a weapon, you can't get rid of<br>
them, so there's no point in saying "it's too soon to say."<br>
<p>
b) Canada is not the peaceful little place you think it is, and the peace<br>
you do see is definitely not the result of a lack of guns.  The only way<br>
you can stop people from hurting each other is if you put everyone in<br>
their own padded cell.  Guns just make the process less painful for the<br>
victim. (would you rather be shot in the head or stabbed to death?)<br>
<p>
Conclusion:  There will always be weapons(even if it's just a big rock<br>
off the ground, or your fist), ergo the only way to stay free<br>
is to arm yourself against those who would oppress you.<br>
