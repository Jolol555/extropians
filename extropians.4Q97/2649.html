<p>
Actually we killed most of them with our germs. Sometimes<br>
accidentally, sometimes on purpose. Here in the midwest there are<br>
scores of huge burial mounds, upon investigation we now know that<br>
the people in these mounds died at the same time, many shortly<br>
after their first contact with British and French fur traders.<br>
<p>
I was reading an account of fur traders visiting a group of Mandan<br>
here in Illinois, the village population was in the thousands. A<br>
year later they returned to find a few very sick survivors and the<br>
massive burial mounds.<br>
<p>
In at least one incident the U.S. Army deliberately sent a group of<br>
Indians blankets from an area undergoing an epidemic (cholera?),<br>
with predictable results.<br>
<p>
As others have already pointed out, the Native peoples waged war<br>
against each other long before we arrived, and has already been<br>
pointed out, had they been BETTER armed, things might have gone<br>
differently.<br>
<p>
I am in no way going to defend our then governments despicable<br>
habit of signing and then breaking treatys. They will have to rot<br>
in there own graves with their own dishonor. <br>
<p>
So to get back on the original subject we can see being well armed<br>
includes a great deal more than mere guns.<br>
<p>
I don't know where you grew up, or where you live now, but let me<br>
clue you in to life here in Chicago.<br>
<p>
When I was a kid there was plenty of gang activity, production guns<br>
were rare, but there was a plethora of the infamous "Zip Guns"<br>
around. If you got caught with a Zip, the cops usually smashed it<br>
on the spot, and you got dragged into the station where your folks<br>
were summoned and you got the ass-whipping of your life.<br>
<p>
In the only two cases I recall where someone was caught with a<br>
production gun, we never saw them again. In other words they ended<br>
up in the justice system and were dealt with very harshly.<br>
<p>
These days the average parent denies that there "tatoo ridden, rap<br>
sheet as long as your arm, youngster" has anything to do with<br>
gangs, guns, or drugs. There's a new case in this morning's<br>
newspaper involving a shooting outside a high school. When caught<br>
in school with a gun, it's argued whether or not suspending them is<br>
appropriate!! <br>
<p>
In a second case here in the news this morning, a group of these<br>
innocent young men (about 50) from Cabrini green, yesterday staged<br>
a protest at a local CHA (Chicago housing authority) police station<br>
over the arrest of one of there fellow "innocent young men". They<br>
then staged a fight outside and when two CHA officers responded,<br>
they were ambushed with broken bottles. As I type, a team of more<br>
than 400 combined officers are sweeping the complex making arrests.<br>
<p>
Want to start reducing handgun crime? Start slapping offenders with<br>
a 20 year no hope of parole sentence, and watch the numbers take a<br>
nosedive. <br>
<p>
Extropian value involved? Personal Responsibility.<br>
<p>
In the mean time I'll look after my own, and keep a neighborly eye<br>
out for you.....<br>
<p>
Peace through fire superiority<br>
<p>
