OK, Then, so far, including myself, I've counted four gun owners just in<br>
responses to the original post, and including Anton. We can do a little<br>
census right here. <br>
<p>
All subscribers to the list, please respond as to whether you own a gun.<br>
Of course, privacy rights would allow anyone to not respond, for fear of<br>
being labelled a gun toting nut by the more politically sensitive here,<br>
or if their local jurisdiction puts a crimp on the subscriber publicly<br>
acknowledging ownership (a human rights violation if ever I have seen<br>
one). You may also contact me privately by email if you wish.<br>
