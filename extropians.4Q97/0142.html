<i>&gt; Sorry, Eliezer. I knew you were also a radical singularitan, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; recall that you were also in the "any day now" camp.</i><br>
<p>
More in the sense of potential than probability.  I think that the most<br>
probable time is actually 2008... using my oddest calculating method yet.  I<br>
figure that in the fifteen years between 1980 and 1995, the E.T.S. went from<br>
2035 to 2020.  That is, each year the projection moves up by one year.  If<br>
this continues, the Singularity should occur in 2008.  I find this argument to<br>
be strangely compelling, perhaps because it sounds so meta.<br>
<p>
But yes, I feel it's obvious that the Singularity could indeed occur any day<br>
now.  For all we knew at the time, it could very well have occurred when Lenat<br>
fired up EURISKO (a Power seed if there ever was one).  I think the Web is now<br>
more than powerful enough to wake up if we knew how to program it. <br>
Nanotechnology might well be a single breakthrough away, and breakthroughs can<br>
occur at any time.  I should also note that the amount of programming<br>
necessary to create a &gt;Web - the Power seed - could almost certainly be done<br>
right on this computer in front of me, if I knew how.<br>
<p>
But I actually do believe that we've got several years to go before Big Money<br>
starts pouring into Singularity development.  Once that happens, I'd give 2:1<br>
odds that the Singularity or worlddeath will occur within two years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've lent my</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy of the book out and have not yet ordered another.</i><br>
<p>
Boy, do I know how *that* feels!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the two of us arrived at our conclusions independently, and I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; very reassured when I found your work. It made me feel a bit less like</i><br>
<i>&gt; some kind of pseudo-religous nut. (Yes, I know feelings can be deceiving</i><br>
<i>&gt; :)</i><br>
<p>
There's a function it never occurred to me I was serving - making everyone<br>
else look sane by comparision!  That really _could_ be useful in getting<br>
people to take the Singularity seriously.  Vinge can say, "Oh, I'm not radical<br>
at all, compared to Clemmenson or Yudkowsky."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find it very frustrating that the list spends so much time on</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant issues of economics and politics. The current economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; and political environment will not change significantly prior to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the singularity: there's not enough time, even if the event occurs</i><br>
<i>&gt; in 2025.</i><br>
<p>
On that, I disagree.  I think that there could be world-shaking developments<br>
for up to a year before Singularity.  It could be that the &gt;Web or a like<br>
Power pops out of nowhere and takes everything over.  It's also possible that<br>
nanotech or IA will appear and persist for years before the fast-mind problems<br>
are solved.  I mean, maybe you can hack neurons with nanotech to bring them up<br>
to electronic speeds - neural impulses max out at 1/3,000,000 the speed of<br>
light.  And maybe you fall over in convulsions, and you can't.  It could go<br>
either way.<br>
<p>
And the acceleration of time works both ways.  The Singularity will occur by<br>
2025 because 2025 is well into the 22nd century, in inflation-adjusted 1974<br>
years.  More than enough time for economies and governments to change drastically.<br>
