Biology: More Evidence of Sperm Count Decline<br>
<p>

<p>
A new study has produced further evidence of a steep decline in sperm<br>
counts among American and European men.<br>
<p>
Three California Health Services Department scientists reviewed data<br>
from 61 studies of sperm density over the past half-century. They adjusted<br>
for differences in data collection and other factors that may have skewed<br>
earlier analyses.<br>
<p>
Average sperm counts among healthy American men dropped by 1.5<br>
percent each year between 1938 and 1990 -- a decline more rapid than<br>
previous studies have suggested, they found. The decline among European<br>
men was about twice as fast, or 3.1 percent a year, according to a report in<br>
the November issue of Environmental Health Perspectives.<br>
