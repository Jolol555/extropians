<i>        &gt;globally, (2) personal refusal to obey any outside government </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Lack of government is the only option because if they're around you must obey  <br>
them. They make you an offer you can't refuse.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What's the difference between the theoretical large-scale private         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;police force and the US government? Just scale?  </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Scale is part of it but there's more, let's start by considering the question <br>
of corruption. The better job a private protection agency (PPA) does, the <br>
more it can charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay with PPA #1 <br>
rather than switch to PPA #2 then I will stay with #1 ONLY if they charge 10$ <br>
less. Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to a dollar stolen directly <br>
from the PPA. For this reason it is in the financial interest of the heads of <br>
the PPA to keep bribery of employees as low as possible. Contrast that to the <br>
situation today, it doesn't cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is <br>
stolen from me, and they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving <br>
payoff money from the thief. <br>
  <br>
Now let's talk about how well privately produced law would do in providing <br>
justice. In a government dictatorship one man's whim can lead to hell on  <br>
earth, but I don't see how 40  million Germans could have murdered 6 million <br>
Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic  world. Things aren't much better in a <br>
democracy or republic,  51% can  decide to kill the other 49% , nothing even <br>
close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.<br>
 <br>
Consider what would happen in Germany a few years ago if law and law  <br>
enforcement were driven by market forces. In general, the desire not to be  <br>
killed is much stronger than the desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish <br>
stranger. Jews would be willing to  pay as much as necessary, up to and <br>
including their entire net worth not to  be killed. I doubt if even the most <br>
rabid anti Semite would go much beyond  2%. As a result the PPA protecting<br>
Jews would be  much stronger than the one that wants to kill them. In Anarchy, <br>
for things  that are REALLY important to you (like not getting killed) you <br>
have much  more influence than just one man one vote.<br>
   <br>
What about reducing the level of violence in the world? Everybody would have <br>
a reason to avoid violence if possible because the disputing parties would <br>
not want to turn their front yard into a war zone and violence is expensive, <br>
it plays hell with the bottom line. The successful protection agencies would<br>
be more interested in making money than glory or even saving face. Most of <br>
the time this would work so I expect the total level of violence to be less <br>
than what we have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop <br>
to zero and just like now even when force  is not used the implicit threat is <br>
always there. <br>
          <br>
What about tyranny, could a PPA become psychotic and take over everything?  <br>
It could happen, but it's much less likely than the US Army doing it and they <br>
certainly have the power to do so if they wanted. At the first signs of <br>
totalitarian behavior in a PPA, people could simply stop doing business with <br>
it and switch to a competitor, this would cut off its  lifeblood, money.<br>
Remember, doing business with a PPA is voluntary and that gives enormous <br>
power to people, a power that citizens forced to finance the  army and police <br>
regardless of their opinion of it, do not have. Also, just  like now, PPA's <br>
in a world of anarchy would attract people who enjoy exercising control over <br>
other people, but unlike the police and army of today, it would also attract <br>
people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer to have in <br>
positions of power.<br>
                   <br>

<i>        &gt;Okay, this is starting to make sense to me.  Are you saying that:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;1. Libertarianism disallows imposition of noncensensual government.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Yes, although "noncensensual government" is a redundant phrase.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Technology may offer an economic model that supercedes government's        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ability to enforce noncensensual rule.</i><br>
          <br>
Exactly.<br>
                   <br>

<i>        &gt;The scenario you cite is not resolved by every inch of land being         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"privately" owned with every landlord having a set of rules,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;regulations, and rent. [...] You suggest that governments have this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;unique attribute that if you stand on gov't property you are subject         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to gov't law, but the same holds for private property; </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
With government there is no place else I can go if I don't like it, but I can <br>
always find a landlord someplace who has rules I like, and in fact there is <br>
nothing stopping me from becoming a landlord myself.<br>
<p>
By the way, I think Ian is doing us a favor in asking us to examine our core <br>
beliefs from time to time, it's not good to become complacent.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There are claims upon land and the claimants demand a rent/tax from         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other people who inhabit the areas within the claims. When I got to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the Earth, every inch was already claimed, so I have to agree to pay         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the fees, try to evade payment, or overthrow the claim.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I will admit that when you're talking about undeveloped land it's difficult <br>
to make an airtight case for ownership based on natural law. If you go back <br>
far enough in the history of any plot of land (except perhaps for Antarctica)  <br>
you will find that somebody stole it from somebody else, government land most<br>
certainly not excepted, but we must deal with practicalities and it's <br>
unrealistic to  expect the way humans manage their affairs to be as neat and <br>
tidy as the axioms of Geometry. Besides, land is not very important.<br>
<p>
The thing that disturbs you is the way resources that were not produces by <br>
human actions, land, was divided up, but that's only a small part of the <br>
wealth or property of the country. In the USA the rental value of buildings <br>
and land is only 13% of the value of all property, and most of that is in the <br>
buildings. Mineral wealth is another 3% and it would be zero is somebody<br>
didn't spend money and  expend labor to get the minerals out of the ground. <br>
The income derived from assets that were not the result of human or machine <br>
labor can't be more than 5% and will certainly shrink much more in the <br>
following years. <br>
<p>
I don't find the argument convincing that because we can't trace a clear <br>
title to 5% of the world's property that gives government the right to <br>
control 100% of it. Their natural law case for ownership of the disputed 5% <br>
is no  stronger than my own, the claim for the other 95% I can only attribute    <br>
to megalomania.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the American government did steal the land fair and square <br>
from the English, who stole it from the French and Spanish, who stole it from <br>
Indian tribes, who stole it from other Indian tribes. <br>
                          <br>
