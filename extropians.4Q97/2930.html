<p>
You have yet to get beyond theorizing. How about some actual data to fit<br>
in the nice words? I would say that, considering that no other<br>
technology has shown as high a benefit to risk ratio as guns, which is<br>
proven by the fact that no other technology has been able to replace<br>
guns in the American free market, you are not being comprehensive in<br>
your analysis if you only count murder statistics to compare the US to<br>
non-gun countries.<br>
<p>
While the murder rate in the US is the highest in the industrialized<br>
world, nobody has mentioned how the US compares to other indutrialized<br>
nations in other crimes, like robbery, mugging, burglary, rape,<br>
extortion, kidnapping, etc... For example, every American I know who has<br>
traveled to Italy has been robbed at least once, likewise a large<br>
percentage of the Americans I know who have traveled to France (yet<br>
France cries about 'human rights' while it shelters a monster like Ira<br>
Einhorn).<br>
<p>
We know from the stats here that privately owned guns have prevented<br>
between 600,000 and 2.4 million crimes annually. Thats not just murders,<br>
but CRIMES. What is the overall crime rate in other countries, and how<br>
does this compare to the US?? Do other countries REPORT crimes with the<br>
same criteria as the US?<br>
<p>
In addition to self protection, another benefit is the recreational. I<br>
have found that people who initially purchase one gun for self<br>
protection, practice with it a few times, quickly become hooked on the<br>
enjoyment of the sporting aspects, and frequently expand their<br>
collection beyond that that might be reasonably needed for self defense,<br>
unless they planned on a David Koresh-like showdown with federales. That<br>
60 million Americans own 200 million guns means that those people own an<br>
average of 3.333 guns per capita. Self defense experts will tell you<br>
that there really is no reason to carry anything more than one main gun<br>
and a small backup, at most. This leaves  1.333 guns in the average<br>
American gun owners posession which really has no defensive purpose. If<br>
there was no significant benefit beyond self defense, the law of<br>
diminishing returns would say that the per capita rate should be between<br>
1-2, and not much over 2 at maximum.<br>
<p>
I can say that only 2 of the 15 guns I own could be classified as useful<br>
for self defensive purposes. The rest are purely recreational, unless<br>
chaos falls tomorrow. Given the per capita rate, and the law of<br>
diminishing returns, we need to measure the comparative value of the<br>
1.33-1.88 guns owned by the average gun owning American that can be<br>
described as for recreational use. Off the cuff, I'd say that the<br>
recreational value is between 25% and 50% of the total value. Also keep<br>
in mind that recreational weapons tend to be more expensive than purely<br>
self defense weapons. (i.e I can purchase a decent new self defense<br>
pistol for between $75 and $250 while a decent new over and under 12<br>
guage shotgun with a sporting clays barrel, briley chokes, and vents<br>
will cost between $700-1400)<br>
<p>
In comparing firearms to other technologies: pepperspray, mace, and<br>
tasers are an extremely limited market. This is partly due to legal<br>
restrictions, but also due to utility. A determined human predator would<br>
not be inhibited significantly by any of these weapons, except if the<br>
taser was used to kill. Such non-lethal means typically merely pisses<br>
the assailant off, makes them angrier and more determined to exact due<br>
punishment upon the victim.<br>
<p>
ANother reason why such non-lethal technologies are limited by law and<br>
by appeal, is the bang factor. Because non-lethal technologies are seen<br>
as just that: non-lethal, a person is more likely to use the weapon<br>
under circumstances which would not be life threatening, thus likely to<br>
bring legal charges against the user, and, more than likely, are liable<br>
to be used against the victim by the assailant when its deterrence value<br>
fails to sway the assailant from his goals, and thus increase the<br>
likelyhood of greater harm to the victim. A gun, due to its positive<br>
'bang' factor, i.e. since it makes a big bang, it must be more powerful<br>
and effective, is, in the mind of the assailant, a more fearful weapon<br>
than spray of a taser, and thus has a greater deterrent value. meek<br>
sprays and zapping tasers do not nearly scare the bejezus out of an<br>
assailant as a .357 going off in one's direction.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've attempted to show that external costs may exist, with all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; attendant ramifications for efficiency. If I can show guns are</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficient economically speaking, then I can argue that the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep and bear arms should probably not include guns. If I can show that</i><br>
<i>&gt; external benefits make guns even more efficient, then I can argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; more guns should be produced. Either way, every argument for or against</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun control implicates practicality.</i><br>
<p>
The only real external costs that exist are a) the possibility that the<br>
assailant's family may bring and win a wrongful death lawsuit against<br>
you or that the police might rule that you were not acting in self<br>
defense(increasing less likely these days), and b) artificial ones<br>
imposed by gun control laws imposed by anti-gun activists.<br>
