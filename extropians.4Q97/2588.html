I wish this were the case, but it is not.  I perform high-level<br>
technology consulting.  In my experience, big corporations are spending<br>
millions if not billions to have their old hardware and software patched<br>
and kludged around the problem.  In most cases, the cost of "fixing" the<br>
old software is much higher than rebuilding the entire system from<br>
scratch, with new software on new hardware.  But, it is too scary for<br>
management to abandon their old systems and/or commit to entirely new<br>
systems.  Thus, they rather spend more money.  I do not believe they<br>
really understand the complexity and costs of keeping their own systems.<br>
<p>
My experience is that it is much easier to do build something correctly<br>
from scratch than to try to add pieces onto a poorly designed system to<br>
make it outperform its intended design.<br>
