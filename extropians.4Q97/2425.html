I suggest you forward your definition to the folks at hotwired. The author<br>
of the piece sort of (politely) implied that he had some of the same<br>
misgivings/complaints you have. From my standpoint: I've had a dedicated<br>
modem line for almost ten years; I've had my own domain name for at least<br>
one; that ought to make me "connected" right there. :)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; From:          GBurch1 &lt;GBurch1@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; WIRED magazine has published the results of a fascinating poll of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the "wired" community.  The article by Jon Katz and some of the poll</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; results can be found at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;        <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/special/citizen/">http://www.hotwired.com/special/citizen/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In one respect I am already less than impressed with this survey, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;I haven't started reading the results.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By their definitions I am "semi-connected".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At work I have two phone lines, voice mail, a pager, an Internet </i><br>
<i>&gt;email address, and two PCs on a network which includes a T1 Internet </i><br>
<i>&gt;connection (and a third PC which I rarely turn on).  I am browsing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Web (work-related) at least twice a week, and receive an average </i><br>
<i>&gt;of probably 20 emails per working day.  My email is usually running </i><br>
<i>&gt;constantly.  At the end of the workday I get on a bus and RELAX for </i><br>
<i>&gt;forty-five minutes.  Since I am relaxing, I don't want to be working </i><br>
<i>&gt;on a laptop or talking on a cell phone, so I don't have those.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I go home to a telephone with answering machine, a modem on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;separate line, a different Internet email address, a half-dozen very </i><br>
<i>&gt;active newsgroups (average about 200 new messages per day not </i><br>
<i>&gt;including spam), a couple active Internet mailing lists (average </i><br>
<i>&gt;about 60 emails per day not including spam), a half dozen web sites </i><br>
<i>&gt;that I look in on at least once a week, and another half dozen per </i><br>
<i>&gt;week that are mentioned in the newsgroups or email and I judge worth </i><br>
<i>&gt;checking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If that is "semi-connected", then anyone who is actually connected </i><br>
<i>&gt;really should get a life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would have suggested a different standard:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Count the number of telephones, modems, fax machines, pagers, cell </i><br>
<i>&gt;phones, and answering machines dedicated for your use (including </i><br>
<i>&gt;your family stuff); add one if you *use* some sort of modem pool or </i><br>
<i>&gt;communal high-speed internet connection at least once a week, ditto </i><br>
<i>&gt;for a communal fax machine.  Include voicemail.  If you have a </i><br>
<i>&gt;multiline phone and the lines are dedicated to your use (with no more </i><br>
<i>&gt;than two coworkers, but including your family), count the extra </i><br>
<i>&gt;lines.  Count the email addresses you check at least three times a </i><br>
<i>&gt;week.  Count the web sites or public archives you have maintained in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the last three months.  Count the mailing lists you've subscribed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;that result in at least three emails a week on average.  Count the </i><br>
<i>&gt;web sites you visit at least once a week, and Usenet groups you read </i><br>
<i>&gt;at least twice a week (that actually have non-spam messages that </i><br>
<i>&gt;often), and the Web sites that you visit in a typical week as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;result of receiving the URL in an email or newsgroup message in that </i><br>
<i>&gt;same week..  Add them all up.  Three or fewer is unconnected.  Four </i><br>
<i>&gt;to nine is semi-connected. Ten to twenty-seven, connected.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Twenty-eight up, super-connected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(The exact numbers that define the categories are not essential.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By the way, by this standard my count is 30; my 16-year-old </i><br>
<i>&gt;daughter's is 12.</i><br>
<i>&gt;US$500 fee for receipt of unsolicited commercial email. USC 47.5.II.227</i><br>
