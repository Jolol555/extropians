Apologies for the lateness of this reply, and the perhaps rather tedious<br>
continuation of this thread after it must have seemed to you to be dead<br>
and buried!<br>

Again, you give me the heartless curmudgeon; again, I give you the<br>
Gaughinesque maiden on the beach.  Private property is a universal rule,<br>
and there are bound to be some cases where its protection will be unfair<br>
according to other considerations.  The heartless curmudgeon is a<br>
marginal, difficult case: but the Gaughinesque maiden represents the<br>
normal run of things, which presents no problem at all.  I believe what<br>
is required for the heartless curmudgeon is economic and moral sanction,<br>
and shaming, perhaps even turning a blind eye to theft (tempering<br>
justice with mercy, a notion as ancient as property itself): but not the<br>
philosophical sanction of theft as a universal rule.<br>
<p>
We aren't accepting the property holder's preferences, we are upholding<br>
a universal rule.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} Private property in the pure capitalist sense requires no justification</i><br>
<i>&gt;} whatsoever.  It is based on a fact: someone *already* controls x,</i><br>
<i>&gt;} therefore they should be *left* in control of it.  Finders keepers.  By</i><br>
<i>&gt;} this definition, neither first acquisition nor exchange are theft,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ah, but what's control?  Control through use, or control through legal</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism of the state?  A bank doesn't directly control an empty office</i><br>
<i>&gt;building, nor does someone control vacation houses they're not living</i><br>
<i>&gt;in, except through the ability to drive out any squatters who might have</i><br>
<i>&gt;occupied the unused property.  Usually this is backed up by the state.</i><br>
<p>
Private property is perhaps most precisely defined as control-of-use. <br>
It equates to use most of the time, but control is the more accurate<br>
concept.  And control is an easily visible, objective fact, signalled by<br>
such things as fences, name tags, etc. - all of which say "I am<br>
presently controlling this thing as part of an ongoing project, please<br>
don't interfere."  Again, most of the time, this is objective enough for<br>
the law to make an objective decision on (as opposed to evaluations of<br>
'possibilities blocked', which is what the leftists ask us to go on, and<br>
which would logically have to be decided by some sovereign authority -<br>
which is why leftist anarchism is less consistent than plain socialism).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hmm.  In a world of private law, perhaps some PPLs would recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt;property by title, and others property by use.  I discover someone's</i><br>
<i>&gt;been living on the abandoned farmland I just inherited from my uncle and</i><br>
<i>&gt;call my title-PPL to evict them.  Their use-PPL steps in to protect</i><br>
<i>&gt;them:  after all, they've been using it for the past 5 years, the land</i><br>
<i>&gt;hadn't been used for the previous decade, who do I think I am to throw</i><br>
<i>&gt;them out of their home?  Private war ensues, unless a buyout occurs, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that could go both ways: they pay me rather than defend themselves (fair</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough for me), or I pay them to leave the land to save the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt;evicting them by force (fair enough for them).</i><br>
<p>
Property goes neither by title nor by use but by control - the rule says<br>
"look to see if anybody's controlling the item you desire to bring under<br>
your own control: if somebody's already controlling it, you must allow<br>
them to keep control of it: your only recourse is therefore gift or<br>
exchange."  You don't actually have to be using something in the sense<br>
of being in present physical contact for it to be said rightly that you<br>
are in control of it (example: controlling the flow of water with a dam<br>
- here I am neither in physical contact with dam or water, nor am I<br>
necessarily 'using' the water).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've just discovered, BTW, (and BTW what does IOW mean?) that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;anarchists seem to have distinguished between 'private' and 'personal'</i><br>
<i>&gt;property.  I'm guess the former refers to factories and the latter to</i><br>
<i>&gt;your toothbrush, but I'm not sure yet.</i><br>
<p>
If they make this distinction, it shows how little they understand that<br>
*exclusivity* is the heart of the matter.  *All* property is private, in<br>
the sense of being exclusive.  Property that is not private (exclusive<br>
to an individual or a univocal voluntary collective) is a meaningless<br>
concept, it seems to me. (IOW means "in other words".)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} What *does* require justification is the *rule* : why *should* we leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;} people in control of what they already control?  The answer to that has</i><br>
<i>&gt;} two parts: a moral, and an economic.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;} </i><br>
<i>&gt;} Roughly, the moral justification is sort of Kantian: it is an insult to</i><br>
<i>&gt;} human dignity to just snatch something that someone is in control of;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, 'control' is not an absolute term.</i><br>
<p>
It is absolute in the sense that it is an objectively verifiable,<br>
natural fact, albeit socially-signalled.  There may be all sorts of<br>
difficulties in practice, but there is no vagueness about the principle.<br>
 This is quite opposite from the case with regard to socialist<br>
 conceptions that are meant to take the place of property: the<br>
 principles are obscure, the practice always idiotically the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} The economic justification is that rewards and penalties for an action</i><br>
<i>&gt;} should, as much as possible, be restricted to the actor concerned. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;} makes for economic efficiency, learning curve possibilities (a la</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} Now nothing is perfect, and there are bound to be some cases where</i><br>
<i>&gt;} sticking to the rule results in 'unfairness' and inefficiency; but as</i><br>
<i>&gt;} Hayek showed, as a *general* rule, private property, and the economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;} system that goes with it, is the best we have yet discovered for getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;} the most out of our abilities and resources.  Is the glass half empty or</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ding ding[1]!  That's the point of my devil's advocacy: what if there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;better system we haven't discovered?  Or more usefully, that has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;discovered but not understood or publicized?  Yes, perfect competition</i><br>
<i>&gt;is maximally efficient, but ignoring the question of whether that's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;we care about (or the corollary that long term profits go to zero, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;always reminds me of the starvation state most wild bacteria live in)</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fact is perfect competition doesn't exist.  Our approximation to it</i><br>
<i>&gt;have done an excellent job of approaching the ideal result, but perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;some other (and non-statist) system could provide a better approximation.</i><br>
<p>
I appreciate your devils' advocacy - not just in principle, but because<br>
I used to be a socialist too, and I haven't forgotten the seductiveness<br>
of the arguments.  As I'm sure you remember from our thread discussing<br>
the Culture, I understand that exclusivity only makes sense in a world<br>
of limited resources: problem is, we're not likely to get to that happy<br>
state by ignoring exclusivity and its socially necessary function.  I<br>
don't understand the point of what you say about perfect competition.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} half full?   Leftist anarchists say half empty: they do not see what</i><br>
<i>&gt;} libertarian anarchists see, which is that 90% of the time, the system</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Careful; they call themselves libertarians too.  And have prior use of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the term -- both terms -- to boot.  Which by our definition of property</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- prior acquisition -- means that we've been trespassing and should</i><br>
<i>&gt;find terms other than "libertarian" or "anarchist" to describe</i><br>
<i>&gt;ourselves.  Anarcho-capitalist, for example.  </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  'Liberal' is, of course, the most accurate term, which *they*<br>
stole from *us*; perhaps that's partly why whoever chose 'libertarian'<br>
chose it - perhaps it was meant as an ironic side-swipe?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} works *extremely* well, and gives more human beings the possibility of</i><br>
<i>&gt;} actually progressing in their lives than any other system yet conceived.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Than any other system yet widely implemented, yes.  They'd argue the</i><br>
<i>&gt;conceived point, and for that matter implementation: the anarchist</i><br>
<i>&gt;communes (and militias) of the Spanish Revolution.  Between Communists</i><br>
<i>&gt;on one side and Fascists on the other (and overhead) they didn't get to</i><br>
<i>&gt;survive long.</i><br>
<p>
As to conceived, it seems to me that all the systems they have conceived<br>
either presuppose unlimited resources, or would be forced to introduce<br>
state control at some point.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} You can't order society by exceptions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;This from the person who brought us the shipwreck and the pig?</i><br>
<p>
No fair!  I'm sure you must have read Dennett on 'intuition pumps'?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} &gt;Mark Grant's retort that the empty office buildings are guarded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;} &gt;zoning laws was a rather more effective defense of capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;} Ooooh, sorr-ree!  Maybe I should just shut my gob? ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, just make more effective defenses to the points at hand. :-)</i><br>
<p>
Well, originally, Remi's comment was a *philosophical* one to the effect<br>
that property is theft.  All I was doing was asking her to look again at<br>
the intuitions that make it seem easy to say that: I wasn't actually<br>
meaning to offer a defense of capitalism in one paragraph!<br>
<p>
It's good for you to play devil's advocate by the way: as David Friedman<br>
has often pointed out, there are many difficult questions that still<br>
haven't been answered.  (No doubt you'll say I haven't answered them<br>
either!)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
