<i>&gt;Since violence or its threat would have to be used to stop me from saying </i><br>
<i>&gt;what I want, I would have no moral reservation in using violence in return. </i><br>
<i>&gt;However I'm a practical man, I don't fight for glory and I don't believe in a  </i><br>
<i>&gt;fair fight. I would only engage in violence if I hopelessly outmatched my </i><br>
<i>&gt;opponent and victory was virtually assured, unfortunately in dealing with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;government this never happens, that's why I pay my taxes. I'm no hero, and </i><br>

<p>
Fair enough. It just seemed a rather extreme position, given the situation<br>
from which it arose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;or showing people fucking to that person's children?</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is none of my business. I respect other people's rights, all I ask is </i><br>
<i>&gt; that they respect mine.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but you *did* use this as an example of one of the things you'd use<br>
violence to preserve your right to do it. Which I thought was a wee tad<br>
extreme.<br>

<i>&gt;      &gt;He [Stallone] hasn't hurt anyone has he? Isn't he free to do what</i><br>
<i>&gt;      &gt;he wants?  He's made a lot of money doing something harmless,         </i><br>
<i>&gt;      &gt;shouldn't you be cheering him on? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree completely. He's entertained millions hurt nobody and gotten rich </i><br>
<i>&gt; doing it. It sounds very Extropian to me.       </i><br>
<p>
This is what I thought. I suspect there are some nationalistic memes some<br>
people need to root out.<br>
