<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the improvements in health.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Many have said exercise is good </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but never has it been explained to me in a convincing manner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1-What are the health benifits besides strong hearts, lungs, and ankles</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(weak ankles cause many falls which lead to complications due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;osteoporosis)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Enhance immunity, enhanced intelligence and mental energy, </i><br>
<i>&gt;increased GH, etc</i><br>
<p>
I have been trying to weigh to benifits of intelligence vs. free-rad<br>
production.<br>
I suppose being stupid would kill me sooner.<br>
Someday I'll ask someone to convince me exercise is good <br>
and they will not only list what it does <br>
they will say how it does it,<br>
Aw who am I kidding. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (just about every life enhancing factor you can think of - except</i><br>
production<br>
<i>&gt; of free radicals and some waste products, both of which are not a</i><br>
problem,<br>
<i>&gt; ie more than made up for by compensating enhancements, if the exercise is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not too extreme)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; after massive intestinal failure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Medically, "Nutritional deficiency" has a very technical meaning. For</i><br>
each<br>
<i>&gt; nutrient which is deemed essential, there is a specific deficency disease</i><br>
<i>&gt; which happens when all others are adequate and only it is deficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is necessary that there be such a disease in order for a nutrient to</i><br>
be<br>
<i>&gt; called essential. The RDA is the amount which is necessary to prevent</i><br>
this<br>
<i>&gt; disease in most people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, it is likely that no one on parenteral feeding "technically" dies</i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt; nutrient deficiency since the diet ensures that they get all of the known</i><br>
<i>&gt; essential nutrients. The problem is that first there are likely still</i><br>
some<br>
<i>&gt; unknown important nutrients</i><br>
<p>
We have STMs and unknown nutrients.<br>
What are they... piconutrients?<br>
Maybe we need foods electromagnetic aura to sustain us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and the term essential as defined above is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily sufficient to keep one alive for very long.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;While I'm speaking of them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3-Have any tests been done to estimate the average length of life </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;after specific nutrients are removed from the diet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For the technically essential nutrients, yes, these things are generally</i><br>
<i>&gt; known.</i><br>
<p>
I searched and gave up after an hour or so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I wonder how long it takes to die from each nutrient deficiency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4-What phrases could I use for a medline search?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You might be better to begin with an advanced nutrition text such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; _Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism_ Groff, Gropper and Hunt</i><br>
<i>&gt; Krause's _Food, Diet, and Nutrition Therapy_</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the</i><br>
capillaries.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, but you need to learn more physiology. </i><br>
<p>
Whoops...plasma.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The red blood cells have</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing to do with nutrient distribution. In fact, more red blood cells</i><br>
<i>&gt; might tend to make it worse, there is only so much blood volume</i><br>
available.<br>
<i>&gt; See Guyton's _A Textbook of Medical Physiology_ (a good book on the body</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes due to exercise also)</i><br>
<p>
 How rapidly could I change red/white cell counts?<br>
If it is controlable enough I could:<br>
A)increase plasma during feeding.<br>
B)increase red cell during exercise.<br>
C)increase white cell during cleansing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there are also increases in efficiency of temperature distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;preventing hyper/hypothermia, thus leading to decreased free-radical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;production from sweating/shivering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again you need to learn more physiology. The body is not warmed and</i><br>
cooled<br>
<i>&gt; as if some central heating system with the blood vessels taking the place</i><br>
<i>&gt; of water or air condiuts. </i><br>
<p>
:-)<br>
As my pride is wounded from my apparent lack of physiological knowledge,<br>
I will defend myself with my grasp of physics <br>
which extends beyond my body into the hot, dry air <br>
which fills my lungs at the center of my being, <br>
warming my soul by reaching through it's bloody tendrils<br>
(rather much like a central heating system).:-)<br>
I am sorry.<br>
Alas, I could not resist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The temperature regulation is done directly by</i><br>
<i>&gt; each cell in response to thyroid hormones and others information</i><br>
transmitters<br>
<i>&gt; all the blood does is even out the temperature from one spot to the</i><br>
other.<br>
<i>&gt; So you are correct that more blood volume could aid in preventing "hot</i><br>
spots"<br>
<i>&gt; where additional free radical damage might be increased by the higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature.</i><br>
<p>
In case you missed my point I will try to explain.<br>
Heat is not soley within the cells.<br>
It can be created in them <br>
though I was meerly pointing out that dehydrated toes get froze.<br>
As water being rapidly pumped through the system <br>
disperses warm blood amongst cold blood <br>
the mean temperature is more easily kept regular(regulated).<br>
I feel better now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; some do some don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;at high altitudes when they have a lack of white cells to fight them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why should people at high altitudes lack white blood cells?</i><br>
<p>
My memory is not what it used to be.<br>
I must try exercising my power of recall.<br>
Maybe I was getting high and low pressure confused?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;if I increase my red cells and my O saturation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My morning pulse is 44. My hematocrit (% of red blood cells) is not that</i><br>
<i>&gt; high though). I have heard of young med students as low as 30. Using a</i><br>
pulse<br>
<i>&gt; oximeter which measures % of hemoglobin saturation, I can hold my breath</i><br>
<i>&gt; without blacking out until my "SAT" goes down to about 85% (normally 98%</i><br>
for<br>
<i>&gt; every healthy person). No one else I know can go below 90%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;7-Any predictions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;8-Hmm...any risk?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't tell you what the risk is until you tell me how you plan to</i><br>
accomplish<br>
<i>&gt; this.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I don't plan to use a hyperbaric chamber <br>
but I'm interested in learning about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Off hand other than be a tranfusion of red cells (dangerous to play with)</i><br>
<p>
That's what I want.<br>
A machine that replentishes the blood supply.<br>
Out with the old, in with the new.<br>
No eating, no drinking, no breathing, no muss, no fuss,<br>
that's the life for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't think of any way to do it (many taking testosterone injections -</i><br>
also<br>
<i>&gt; dangerous to play with).</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; digestive system and the liver to be assimulated properly. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1)What nutrients need what parts?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Too detailed to go into here, but clearly proteins must be broken </i><br>
<i>&gt; apart into amino acids or short peptides,</i><br>
<p>
I prefer to eat aminos in place of protiens,<br>
and I would if I could afford it financially.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; many vitamins and nutrients</i><br>
<i>&gt; have active transport mechanisms form the intestines, </i><br>
<p>
I wish I knew more about that.<br>
Anyone see a geni around here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the liver does</i><br>
<i>&gt; essential modification of many vitamins and nutrients eg changing EFA's</i><br>
<i>&gt; into triglycerides.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Read the nutrition and metabolism book which I suggested in my other</i><br>
<i>&gt; message.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2)The intestines perform a function.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If that function can be quantified and reproduced externally that is</i><br>
what I<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;want.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see where you are coming from (and trying to get to). I like the idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem is that the body is far too complicated physiologically and</i><br>
<i>&gt; biochemically, and our understanding is far too limited, for anything</i><br>
like<br>
<i>&gt; what you want to be possible for decades to come.</i><br>
<p>
ERROR.<br>
GIVEN DATA UNACCEPTABLE.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I prefer feeding to take as little time as possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree. That's why I now do most of my feeding by drinking blended food</i><br>
<i>&gt; "slurries". The blender 'chewing' the food saves me time and effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Occassionally, I still chew because I like chewing and its good for my</i><br>
teeth<br>
<i>&gt; and gums which I don't want to atrophy (just yet :).</i><br>
<p>
I once made a salad slurrie.<br>
I did not realize I could fit an entire head of lettuce in one glass!<br>
The amount of calories I would have saved from blending.<br>
were spent setting up and cleaning the blender. <br>
It's only worth it if done in mass quantities or if I have no teeth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I would rather everything be predigested </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;so I don't have to walk around waiting for my cells to be fed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The predigested part is not so easy. I believe there are healthy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutritional benefits of passing food throught the digestive system which</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot easily be gained any other way.</i><br>
<p>
Like fiber soaking up toxins?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I am trying to avoid using as many body parts as I can.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then there are easier ones to avoid using than the whole digestive</i><br>
<i>&gt; system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about having your arms and legs amputated?</i><br>
<p>
I've thought about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Maybe leave your</i><br>
<i>&gt; right arm so you can type - or maybe not with good voice recognition)</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is evidence that shorter people live longer. </i><br>
<p>
What should I search for?<br>
Nearly anything with "longevity" I've seen.<br>
Do you have a hypothesis?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It might be true</i><br>
<i>&gt; the a happy arm/leg amputee who gets his exercise by rolling around</i><br>
<i>&gt; and squirming on the floor might live longer too. :) </i><br>
<p>
I want documentation!<br>
Doctors will gladly give amputees bionic limbs, <br>
but I doubt many would take me seriously if I told them to chop me up <br>
even if I agreed to pay them an arm and a leg.:- )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That way when I have to start replacing parts I can save $. :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If food was processed( broken into componant parts and sterilized) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;before eaten many parts of the digestive system become unnessasary, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;such as the teeth, tongue, saliva, esophagus, stomach, stomach acids </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which serve only to make bits of food smaller and more pure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not just smaller, other imporant functions. Anyway some of the parts</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have listed do not wear our early or are not terminal if they do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't believe that anyone has ever died from a wornout tongue or had</i><br>
<i>&gt; a tongue transplant for that matter. :)</i><br>
<p>
I bet you $10 Amer. someone has had a tongue transplant. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also tongues can be very useful for lots of fun things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wouldn't want to be without one. :)</i><br>
<p>
I would rather not have to worry about any more cells the I have to.<br>
I just another mouth to feed.:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;High O means low pulse/respiration, which means those parts last longer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I you breathed up to a 50% oxygen mixture, the amount of oxygen in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; blood would only increase a little (the disolved %) since most of it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the "hypersaturated" (actively bound) hemoglobin. Your pluse rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; would change very little. It is true that your would need to breathe less</i><br>
<i>&gt; than half as frequently or deeply, however. But the cumulative long-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage on the lung tissue of the extra oxygen would probably negate any</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit.</i><br>
<p>
I need to research this more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The big point here, Mike, is that "good old Mother Nature" has pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; well optimised us already.</i><br>
<p>
"Extropians look at the human body and say, <br>
Isn't this a marvel of nature, but I think we can do a little bit better." <br>
Mommy has poor distribution of resources.<br>
We are made of C, H, and O because they are so abundant and flexible,<br>
but now our mother is telling us how to build bones out of titanium <br>
and brains from diamond.<br>
I am still dying, my centuries are numbered, so I am far from optimal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; A laudable goal, but how do you implement it without exercise?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Replace those muscles with machines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is already being done with today's technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eventually, I agree. But we are nowhere near the "bionic man" yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Easier to try the amputee route mentioned above.</i><br>
<p>
Have you done much research into cybernetics?<br>
Few know what lurks in yonder top secret military installations.;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Movement means free-radicals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; So does eating,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I am trying to make eating easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Solid foods tax the jaw and stomach muscles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Use slurries as described above. (They also make taking &gt;100 nutrient</i><br>
<i>&gt; pills per day a breeze!) I expect they also make it easier on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stomach although the acid requirements will not be changed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;breathing</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;More O = low respiration rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Or I could get better lungs( transplants, biotech implants, bionics).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not for a long time yet. Our natural ones a pretty damned good.</i><br>
<p>
Emergency life support systems work pretty well.<br>
They last as long as your insurance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;and being alive. Free-radicals are both</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; harmful and necessary for life at the same time. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I do not belive they will ALWAYS be necessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, they will be. They are generated by the mitochondrial production</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ATP in every cell (including your precious brain). All that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do is *control* them, not eliminate them.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;It's where they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; are formed and how they are dealt with that is important.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Absolutely!  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, I have had trouble finding ways to protect my my brain,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can best proctect your brain by first all the same things as will</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect the rest of your body - your brain is *fundamentally* similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; cells after all. Then you go after a lot of the "smart drugs" things</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are especially brain protective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free</i><br>
radicals.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; In the right places and at the right times, they are part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; metabolic processes of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3)Would you mind pointing out those places and times </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;so I can begin thinking about how to make them better?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Done a bit above. Read a good biochemistry book.</i><br>
<p>
Good books are hard to find.<br>
<p>
White cells use them to help fight germs too( rads not books).<br>
I wonder if they get out of control.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I would rather live without uncontrolled atoms smashing through my DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The area to concentrate on most, IMO is the mitochondria, where there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; very few repair mechanisms for DNA damage caused by erratic free</i><br>
radicals.<br>
<i>&gt; Our bodies can live with this only because we have multiple mitos in each</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell and because they can divide and multipy within the cell (except</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes damaged ones mulitply faster than the good ones and destroy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell). </i><br>
<p>
I have lists of the leading causes of human death,<br>
but what are the leading causes of cell death?<br>
I looked but could not find anything.<br>
A body count would be helpful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill yourself.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; A much too simplistic view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It was only one sentence among many.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Don't make too much of it, ok?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Notice I did say EXCESS.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, you're right.</i><br>
<p>
Hey, thanks.<br>
That's a pleasant and uncommon response.<br>
I admit, <br>
there is quite a difference between causing excess free radicals and<br>
suicide.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe. But it is also going to kill you quite quickly for other</i><br>
reasons.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Some have suggested( maybe on this list) that the low temp </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;may lead to life extension.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No question of it IMO. I am very pleased that my morning body temp is</i><br>
only<br>
<i>&gt; 95.7'F and it only rises to 97.2'F during the day. (and I am *not*</i><br>
hypothyroid)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This could become a seperate thread: Low Body Temp.- Good/Bad?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think its definitely good, but CR, melatonin, (and genes) are the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; harmless ways to lower it that I know of.</i><br>
<p>
Less body work = less heat.<br>
Molecular agitation is another reason I do not want to use many body parts.<br>
Is thermal noise a threat to health?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;How were you intending to do the basic exercise functions (walking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; breathing 'fully') you listed if you are confined to a wheelchair.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Geez, I won't chain myself too it or anything.:-) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'll get up when I have too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Intense breathing exercises can build heart and diaphram muscles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't do much for the heart I don't believe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Let's not forget isometric exercises, working muscles against each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like the bicept/tricept "show me your muscle" pose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think isometrices will fulfill the function of either aerobics</i><br>
<i>&gt; (heart, lung, arteries, veins, immune system, happy endorphins, etc( or</i><br>
<i>&gt; weight work (prevent osteoporosis).</i><br>
<p>
Clinch every muscle in your body for a few minutes <br>
and see if you heart is not racing.<br>
It won't build alot of strength <br>
and won't put alot of strain on most bones, <br>
you are right.<br>
<p>
About endorphins,<br>
have you ever heard of anyone being able to release them at will?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sorry, I don't often give references for my beliefs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm too busy preparing for the possiblities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But you *do* need to take time to read and understand the science</i><br>
<i>&gt; behind those possibilties!</i><br>
<p>
I can not prepare for things I do not understand. ;-)<br>
