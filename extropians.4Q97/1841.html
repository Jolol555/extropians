The best revenge would be to kidnap them and upload them. It would be<br>
interesting to see an uploaded antitechnologist try to sue someone for<br>
forcibly uploading them.... are they really the plaintiff, or merely a<br>
devil spawned simulacrum???? If they don't have a soul, can they testify<br>
in court, or even file suit????? If they are prolife, wouldn't voluntary<br>
deletion of the upload constitute both murder, abortion, and suicide, or<br>
merely the same thing as erasing a video tape????<br>
