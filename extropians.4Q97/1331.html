CNN said that my TWA 800 research was a "sham" and a "plot." <br>
<p>
That is a lie. Here is one of my reports. All these referenced <br>
<p>
items are accurate. Can you find any "sham" or "plot"? If not, <br>
<p>
what does that tell us about CNN?  Spread this far and wide.<br>

<p>
<p>
        One year after the pulverized remains of <br>
<p>
        TWA Flight 800 plunged into the sea, it's <br>
<p>
        clearer than ever that the passengers on <br>
<p>
        board were victims of a missile strike. <br>
<p>
<p>
        While most of the 154 missile-witness<br>
<p>
        accounts taken by the FBI remain covered <br>
<p>
        up, a few accounts are available to the <br>
<p>
        public, such as the accounts of 5 pilots<br>
<p>
        who were flying in the area when TWA 800 <br>
<p>
        was suddenly annihilated:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        FIVE PILOTS - FIVE MISSILE WITNESSES<br>
<p>
<p>
        PILOT 1: Colonel William Stratemeier, Jr.<br>
<p>
<p>
        AVIATION WEEK &amp; SPACE TECHNOLOGY reported <br>
<p>
        that Air National Guard C-130 pilot Colonel <br>
<p>
        Stratemeier "said he had seen what appeared <br>
<p>
        to be the trail of a shoulder-fired SAM ending <br>
<p>
        in a flash on the 747." [1] However, in the <br>
<p>
        next issue of AVIATION WEEK Stratemeier re-<br>
<p>
        cants, saying: "We did not see smoke trails <br>
<p>
        [from a missile], any ignition source from <br>
<p>
        the tail end of a rocket nor anything..."[2] <br>
<p>
<p>
        Col. Stratemeier recanted and therefore was <br>
<p>
        not hit with an FBI gag order, but the next <br>
<p>
        two ANG pilots did not recant their accounts <br>
<p>
        and therefore were hit with FBI gag orders.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        PILOT 2: Captain Christian Baur<br>
<p>
<p>
        AVIATION WEEK &amp; SPACE TECHNOLOGY reports <br>
<p>
        that right after the TWA 800 accident, ANG <br>
<p>
        HH-60 helicopter co-pilot Captain Baur told <br>
<p>
        federal officials: "Almost due south, there <br>
<p>
        was a hard white light, like burning pyrotech-<br>
<p>
        nics, in level flight. I was trying to figure <br>
<p>
        out what it was. It was the wrong color for <br>
<p>
        flares. It struck an object coming from the <br>
<p>
        right [TWA 800] and made it explode." [3] <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        PILOT 3: Major Frederick Meyer <br>
<p>
<p>
        At a press conference the day after the TWA <br>
<p>
        800 accident, ANG HH-60 helicopter pilot Major<br>
<p>
        Meyer said: "I saw something that looked to me<br>
<p>
        like a shooting star.  Now you normally don't <br>
<p>
        see a shooting star when the sun is up. It was <br>
<p>
        still bright... Almost immediately thereafter, <br>
<p>
        I saw, in rapid succession, a small explosion <br>
<p>
        then a large explosion." [4] Meyer said that <br>
<p>
        the initial explosion  "looked identical to <br>
<p>
        the detonation of an antiaircraft shell."[3]<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        PILOT 4: Vasilis Bakounis <br>
<p>
<p>
        Private Pilot and Olympic Airlines engineer<br>
<p>
        Vasilis Bakounis told the Greek publication <br>
<p>
        ELEFTHEROTYPIA [5] that as he was heading <br>
<p>
        toward Gabreski Airport on July 17, 1996, <br>
<p>
        "Suddenly I saw in the fog to my left toward <br>
<p>
        the ocean, a small flame rising quickly to-<br>
<p>
        ward the sky. Before I realized it, I saw <br>
<p>
        this flame become huge. My first thought was<br>
<p>
        that it was a flare that had been launched <br>
<p>
        from some boat... This flame then started <br>
<p>
        to quickly lose altitude and a few seconds <br>
<p>
        later there was... a second explosion."<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        PILOT 5: Sven Faret <br>
<p>
<p>
        Flying at 8,500 feet moments before the<br>
<p>
        cataclysmic explosion of TWA 800, private <br>
<p>
        pilot Sven Faret reported that a "short <br>
<p>
        pin-flash of light appeared on the ground, <br>
<p>
        perhaps water." [6] When asked if the flash <br>
<p>
        of light rose upwards vertically from the <br>
<p>
        earth, Sven confirmed that it did, stating<br>
<p>
        that it was "like a rocket launch at a <br>
<p>
        fireworks display" with a point-of-origin <br>
<p>
        "near the shoreline or in the water." [7]<br>
<p>
<p>
        All 5 pilots witnessed a rapidly moving <br>
<p>
        luminous and fiery object that was:<br>
<p>
<p>
        1. like a surface-to-air missile<br>
<p>
        2. like burning pyrotechnics<br>
<p>
        3. like a meteor yet not like a meteor<br>
<p>
        4. like a small flame rising quickly<br>
<p>
        5. like a rocket at a fireworks display<br>
<p>
<p>
        All 5 accounts indicate that this rapidly <br>
<p>
        moving fiery object hit TWA 800 initiating<br>
<p>
        the explosions that killed all on board.<br>
<p>
        At least 2 of the pilots saw the object <br>
<p>
        early enough in its trajectory to have <br>
<p>
        seen it rise upwards from the Earth.<br>
<p>
<p>
        The accounts of the pilots in the air are <br>
<p>
        corroborated by over 100 witnesses on the<br>
<p>
        ground who also saw a fiery object shoot <br>
<p>
        upwards and intercept TWA 800. Some of <br>
<p>
        them said that the fiery object was:<br>
<p>
<p>
        * like a flare<br>
<p>
        * like a thin white line<br>
<p>
        * like Grucci fireworks<br>
<p>
        * like a skyrocket<br>
<p>
<p>
        Most witnesses, such as Naneen Levine<br>
<p>
        on CNN [8], report that the fiery object<br>
<p>
        followed a curving trajectory as it shot<br>
<p>
        upwards toward TWA 800. There is simply<br>
<p>
        no phenomena other than the firing of a<br>
<p>
        missile that can explain all the details <br>
<p>
        reported by the witnesses who saw that <br>
<p>
        luminous object streak toward TWA 800.<br>
<p>
<p>
        When we also consider that TWA 800 wreck-<br>
<p>
        age shows the signs of missile damage,[9] <br>
<p>
        the real question is not was it a missile <br>
<p>
        that hit TWA 800, but whose missile was it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        TERRORISTS OR THE U.S. NAVY?<br>
<p>
<p>
        While the number of "terrorist-missile <br>
<p>
        theories" is greater than zero, the number <br>
<p>
        of terrorists known to be in the area during <br>
<p>
        the crash is zero. Military experts have <br>
<p>
        shown that the probability that terrorists <br>
<p>
        could even deploy the military hardware <br>
<p>
        necessary to destroy TWA 800 with a missile <br>
<p>
        is near zero. In sum, the terrorist-missile <br>
<p>
        theory offers us a whole lot of nothing.<br>
<p>
<p>
        In contrast to the terrorist-missile theory, <br>
<p>
        the U.S. Navy (a) could deploy the military <br>
<p>
        hardware necessary to take out TWA 800, (b) <br>
<p>
        did deploy assets to the area that were both <br>
<p>
        below and above TWA 800 when it was hit, and <br>
<p>
        (c) did activate warning zones near TWA 800 <br>
<p>
        for military exercises and live-firings. TWA<br>
<p>
        800 even changed course to avoid an active<br>
<p>
        naval-warning zone moments before it was hit. <br>
<p>
        Unlike the terrorist theory, the Navy-missile <br>
<p>
        theory is overflowing with evidence.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        THE NAVY SHUFFLE<br>
<p>
<p>
        It is common for the guilty to try to deny the <br>
<p>
        facts that place them at the scene of the crime <br>
<p>
        or accident. The U.S. military tried to deny <br>
<p>
        the fact that it was at the scene of the TWA <br>
<p>
        800 accident. On July 23, 1996, Department of <br>
<p>
        Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon told the press:<br>
<p>
<p>
            I'm not aware [that] there were any <br>
<p>
            military exercises in the area. I've <br>
<p>
            been told by the Joint [Chiefs of] <br>
<p>
            Staff that there were not. [10]<br>
<p>
<p>
        Yet after eight months of such denials, the <br>
<p>
        Navy finally admitted that naval exercises <br>
<p>
        were taking place off Long Island at the time <br>
<p>
        of the TWA 800 accident. [11] The Navy also <br>
<p>
        admitted that they had three submarines off <br>
<p>
        Long Island in the ocean below TWA 800. [11] <br>
<p>
<p>
        We know that there were at least 8 military<br>
<p>
        assets in the area of the TWA 800 accident:<br>
<p>
<p>
        1. NAVY: The ALBUQUERQUE, attack sub<br>
<p>
        2. NAVY: The TREPANG, attack sub<br>
<p>
        3. NAVY: The WYOMING, ICBM sub<br>
<p>
        4. NAVY: P-3 Orion aircraft<br>
<p>
        5. NAVY: The NORMANDY, missile cruiser<br>
<p>
        6. USCG: The ADAK, CG patrol boat<br>
<p>
        7. NYANG: HC-130 aircraft<br>
<p>
        8. NYANG: HH-60 helicopter<br>
<p>
<p>
        Every asset except the Adak has either <br>
<p>
        (a) been denied to exist or (b) had its <br>
<p>
        reported location at the time of the TWA<br>
<p>
        800 accident changed by the military. For <br>
<p>
        example, while shuffling around crash-time<br>
<p>
        locations for months, the military placed<br>
<p>
        4 of its assets in 11 locations:<br>
<p>
      <br>
<p>
        The Navy-missile-cruiser Normandy was:<br>
<p>
        1. 180 miles away [12]<br>
<p>
        2. 185 miles away [13]<br>
<p>
        3. over 200 miles away [11]<br>
<p>
<p>
        The Navy P-3 Orion aircraft was:<br>
<p>
        1. 15 miles to the south [14]<br>
<p>
        2. about 1 mile southwest [15]<br>
<p>
        3. 3,700 feet below TWA 800 [16]<br>
<p>
        4. 7,000 feet above TWA 800 [15]<br>
<p>
<p>
        The ANG C-130 aircraft was:<br>
<p>
        1. 10 miles offshore [17]<br>
<p>
        2. flying along the coast [18]<br>
<p>
<p>
        The ANG HH-60 helicopter was:<br>
<p>
        1. 10 miles offshore at 3,000 feet<br>
<p>
           doing search and rescue practice.[1] <br>
<p>
        2. 3 miles inland at 100 feet<br>
<p>
           doing practice landings. [19]<br>
<p>
<p>
        Are we to believe that with as many as <br>
<p>
        nine military radar systems blanketing<br>
<p>
        the area [20] it would take months for <br>
<p>
        the military to figure out where it was?<br>
<p>
        The pattern of location shifting has <br>
<p>
        been to move military assets further <br>
<p>
        away from the accident than initially <br>
<p>
        reported or further than was eventually <br>
<p>
        discovered, as in the case of the P-3,<br>
<p>
        which tapes proved was more than 10x<br>
<p>
        closer to TWA 800 than once claimed.<br>
<p>
<p>
        If the denial of evidenced proximity to <br>
<p>
        the crime scene is evidence of culpability, <br>
<p>
        then, since multiple instances of military <br>
<p>
        proximity to TWA 800 have been denied by <br>
<p>
        the military, the evidence that the mili-<br>
<p>
        tary is culpable in the downing of TWA <br>
<p>
        800 is significant.  The fact that not <br>
<p>
        only assets but military exercises were <br>
<p>
        denied, makes this evidence compelling.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
        CONNECTING THE DOTS<br>
<p>
<p>
        TWA 800 researcher Tom Shoemaker recently<br>
<p>
        discovered documents showing that both the <br>
<p>
        New York Air National Guard and the Navy <br>
<p>
        were engaged in a large-scale exercise <br>
<p>
        called "Global Yankee '96" taking place <br>
<p>
        off shore between July 16 and 26, 1996.[20] <br>
<p>
<p>
        Shoemaker's findings confirm the claim of <br>
<p>
        TWA 800 researcher James Sanders that the <br>
<p>
        Navy and the ANG were working together <br>
<p>
        at the time of the accident. [21] <br>
<p>
<p>
        While the fact that ANG pilots reported <br>
<p>
        what they saw would seem to contradict <br>
<p>
        the possibility of their culpability, it<br>
<p>
        is clear that the ANG is not being forth-<br>
<p>
        right about the locations of ANG assets <br>
<p>
        at crash time.[18,URL] It should also be<br>
<p>
        noted that ANG co-pilot Baur never said <br>
<p>
        what he saw when he had the chance to at <br>
<p>
        a press conference after the crash; that <br>
<p>
        Major Meyer suggested first and foremost <br>
<p>
        that TWA 800 was hit by a meteorite; and <br>
<p>
        that Stratemeier suggested it was hit by <br>
<p>
        a terrorist-style missile, then suddenly <br>
<p>
        claimed he saw nothing. If the Navy and/<br>
<p>
        or the ANG are guilty, then the ANG pilot <br>
<p>
        responses would be predictable misleads.<br>
<p>
<p>
        One year after the fiery demise of TWA <br>
<p>
        800, the  Navy-missile theory not only <br>
<p>
        remains superior to all other TWA 800 <br>
<p>
        theories, but is stronger than ever.<br>

[18] NYANG rep. James Finkle says the C-130 was not in JAWS:<br>

[19] In [1] the HH-60 is reported to have been offshore with the <br>
<p>
     C-130, which the ANG says was in JAWS ten miles offshore, <br>
<p>
     but then suddenly the HH-60 was moved over Gabreski Airport:<br>

<p>
     I called AVIATION WEEK and was told that it was an NYANG<br>
<p>
     representative who told them that the HH-60 was offshore.<br>
<p>
     I was told that the NYANG rep. read the off shore 3,000 <br>
<p>
     ft altitude location straight from Major Meyer's report.<br>

[21] The Downing of TWA Flight 800. By James Sanders, 1997.<br>
<p>
&lt;smaller&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;/smaller&gt;A pack of "unreferenced rumors"? HA! The media's presentation <br>
<p>
of Ian Goddard's TWA 800 inquiry is a Big Lie in full display.<br>
