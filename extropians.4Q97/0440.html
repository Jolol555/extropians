Thanks for all the interesting commentary on this subject.<br>
It has helped me to clarify the nature of my frustration.<br>
<p>
First, while I'm not a libertarian, I'm not opposed to<br>
libertarian philosophy, either. My problem with political<br>
theory and economic theory is general, not directed toward<br>
any particular brand. My problem is that these fields<br>
do not appear to be based on any agreed-upon set of<br>
fundamental facts. They differ from disciplines such<br>
as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology, which each<br>
have an agreed-upon basis. Economics and politics<br>
are in the same category of fuzzy science with psychology<br>
and sociology.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, we will continue to disagree about these<br>
subjects, and we will have difficulty making any progress,<br>
until we have an underlying theory with the same predictive<br>
power as evolution in biology, atom theory in chemistry,<br>
or Newton's laws in physics, and plate tectonics in geology.<br>
<p>
Since this is true, debate makes little progress. Therefore<br>
we (humanity) should spend our time on technical progress.<br>
This will generate the tools we need to develop more intelligence.<br>
We (or our successors) can then figure out the appropriate<br>
underlying theories for what are now the fuzzy sciences.<br>
<p>
There are two types of political commentary that are IMO<br>
appropriate to this list. The first relates to short-term<br>
political activities that affect the short-term rate of<br>
technical progress. For example, an attempt to ban research<br>
on faster computers, or to outlaw strong cryptography, may<br>
qualify. The second type depends on a belief that the nature<br>
of our successors may depend on our current non-technical<br>
beliefs or actions. If you feel that individualism is<br>
important and you want our successor civilization to include<br>
individuals, you may wish to discuss how to bring this about.<br>
Note, an "individualism is good" post is IMO useless. A post<br>
discussing ways to guide the nacent cizilization toward<br>
individualism may be useful.<br>
<p>
This post has been an attempt to explain my own thoughts.<br>
I'm not attempting to demand any change in style by other<br>
list participants.<br>
