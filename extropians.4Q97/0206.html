<i>&gt; &gt; figure that in the fifteen years between 1980 and 1995, the E.T.S. went from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2035 to 2020.  That is, each year the projection moves up by one year.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this continues, the Singularity should occur in 2008.  I find this argument to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be strangely compelling, perhaps because it sounds so meta.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually I find that the Singularity stays about 20-30 years in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future.  I'd like to see some evidence that anyone in 1980 predicted it</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the Singularity back then.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 20-30 years is enough time for significant changes in technology and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in society.  When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; could occur in that time frame.  In fact, technology has not advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; as fast as was expected back then, at least not in those areas.  AI has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been 20-30 years away since the 1950's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's our old friend, the S curve.  Right now the growth in performance</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks exponential, just as the increase in sewing machine speeds (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtually any other industrial performance measure) looked exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt; at one time.  But they hit a limit back then, and we will probably hit</i><br>
<i>&gt; a limit ourselves now.</i><br>
<p>
THough, the current s curve is in processors. We are still at the<br>
beginnning of the cost/performance curve with respect to<br>
multiprocessor/neural net computers. I think once we start to hit the<br>
wall with processors, we'll start to see more and more affordable<br>
multiprocessor PCs, which ought to last another decade at most before<br>
another wall is hit, at which point more exotic technologies will start<br>
to become available, as soon as the neural computers are cheap enough to<br>
make widespread use in engineering applications. This will bootstrap the<br>
affordability of the R&amp;D to develop the new exotic technologies.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That doesn't mean that progress will stop; all the ramifications of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the information revolution will continue to develop even if computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; performance tops out a few orders of magnitude better than we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; it today.  And there are other technologies which are poised for growth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; biotech of course, and possibly materials science, microtech, etc.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; are probably going to be the hot fields of 2010.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can</i><br>
<i>&gt; guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined</i><br>
<i>&gt; to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though</i><br>
<i>&gt; things often take much longer than we expect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
To those who live it, they will never notice any drastic change, and no<br>
singularity, per se, will be reached. People will always consider the<br>
limit of the knowable to be x many development cycles in the future.<br>
Granted, as things speed up and people get smarter and smarter, x will<br>
continually shrink, but the amount of shrink will diminish over time to<br>
a set amount of time in which extrapolation is reliable. Remember, an<br>
event horizon is only such in relation to a specific point in the past,<br>
it itself has no fixed point.<br>
