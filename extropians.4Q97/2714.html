Isn't that exactly what a heat engine does, when you think of it in<br>
information theoretic terms? Of course it is not a perpetual motion<br>
machine since when it erases bits, it raises the temperature of the low<br>
temp heat sink, and when it randomizes bits, it lowers the temperature of<br>
the high temp heat source, so eventually the temperature difference<br>
disappears. (Of course I'm excluding black holes here, since<br>
when you "heat up" a black hole by dumping energy into it, it actually<br>
gets cooler.)<br>
<p>
I don't see how you can say there is no advantage to erasing bits at lower<br>
temperatures, since your free energy is limitied, and at lower<br>
temperatures the same amount of free energy allows you to erase more bits.<br>
The trick is to obtain a low temperature without spending energy on active<br>
cooling, and that's what a black hole allows you to do. Perhaps what<br>
you're saying is that it wouldn't help to cool your computer to 0.1K if<br>
the best heat sink you have access to has a temperature of 3K. I certainly<br>
agree with this. <br>
<p>
I think we're probably not really disagreeing, just emphasizing different<br>
aspects of the same idea.<br>
