In a message dated 97-10-24 04:00:59 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Well, if we were to erroneously assume that the moon is the same size it<br>
 always was, and that the earth has expanded due to accumulated<br>
 meteoroidal material, then we would need to have accumulated material to<br>
 be 750 miles deep over the entire surface. This comes out to an<br>
 accumulation rate on average of one tenth of an ince every decade. Since<br>
 total new soil generation on earth averages  one inch per 30,000 years,<br>
 coming from all sources, including erosion of existing rock, I find this<br>
 figure highly specious.<br>
 <br>
 Since we know that the moon has accumulated material at a far faster<br>
 rate than the earth, due to its higher angular velocity allowing it to<br>
 sweep through more space than the earth while taking advantage of the<br>
 earth's greater gravity well as an attractor of material, we can<br>
 conclude that the only time in earth's history that the moon may fit<br>
 into a tetrahedron large enough to fit inside the earth, is sometime far<br>
 into the future, so long as the sun doesn't go nova first.<br>
<i> &gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No not at all, the earth has been expanding due to matter from the inner core<br>
being moved into the mantle, (the inner core is 3 times as dense as the<br>
mantle)...(well im not sure if its the inner or outer core, or a process of<br>
both) which happens at a far faster rate than soil deposits on the earth or<br>
moon.  Im referring to the study (sorry no references, Ill ask some people<br>
and try and find out) that concludes that if you fit the continents back<br>
together again into the original land mass, the only way they'll fit properly<br>
is if the earth was 80% of the size that it is now.  And since the moon<br>
doesnt have a hot mantle (well, im not sure if it did back then though, it<br>
doesnt seem like it) it would have been approximately the same size (maybe a<br>
mile smaller due to the meteoric impacts you were talking about).<br>
