Bode's law had nothing to do with platonic solids it was a series that seemed <br>
to fit the spacing of the planets. The idea was to give each planet a number <br>
and then add 4 to it, Mercury got a 0, Venus a 3, Earth a 6, Mars a 12 and so <br>
on. Calling the asteroid Ceres a planet was stretching it, but other than <br>
that the fit wasn't too bad and even when Uranus was discovered it was close <br>
to where the law said. Everything was going so well, and then Neptune and <br>
Pluto were found and the "Law" failed badly.<br>
<p>
The nesting platonic solids idea for the orbits of the planets was due to the <br>
early work of the great mathematician and astronomer Johann Kepler. <br>
He proposed his idea in 1596 and the agreement with observation was not great <br>
but it wasn't terrible either and Kepler knew that Tycho Brahe had much <br>
better observational data, the best ever made before the telescope. When he <br>
finely got to see Tycho's data he was horrified to discover it did not fit <br>
his theory, the disagreement was not large but it was too large for Kepler <br>
because he knew what a careful observer Tycho was. I think this is where <br>
Kepler proved he was a great scientist, even though he loved his theory and<br>
had spent years of his life on it, when he found it didn't agree with <br>
observation, however slightly, he immediately abandoned it and went on to <br>
other things. The story has a happy ending because the "other things" were <br>
his discovery that planets moved in ellipses and his 3 laws of planetary <br>
motion, and that lead the way for Newton. If he'd screamed that the data must <br>
be wrong, as most would have even today, Kepler would be only a footnote in <br>
the history of science instead of one of the giants.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, Kepler was also an astrologer, he had to be, that's how <br>
astronomers made their living back then. I think astrology is pure bull shit <br>
but that's because I'm a Leo and they're notoriously skeptical about that <br>
sort of thing.                                     <br>
