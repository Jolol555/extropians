<p>
This is not quite right; it is easy to show that 2^B equals C, where B<br>
is aleph-null.  Simply identify the points on the unit segment with their<br>
representation in base two.  The number of possible binary representations<br>
of length n is 2^n, so the total number of binary representations of<br>
length aleph-null is 2^aleph-null, and that is the number of points on<br>
the line.  (This is a slight oversimplification but it is the basic idea.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even today the "Continuum Hypothesis"  which states that C is  </i><br>
<i>&gt; equal to alpha-one (2^B) has never been proven and remains of the great</i><br>
<i>&gt; mysteries of mathematics.</i><br>
<p>
The Continuum Hypothesis does say that C is equal to aleph-one, but the<br>
issue in question is what is aleph-one.  There are no sets known to<br>
have the cardinality of aleph-one, as I understand it.  Aleph-one is<br>
defined as the smallest cardinal greater than aleph-zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cantor also showed that C^C = F &gt; C where F is the number of all one valued </i><br>
<i>&gt; functions,  there are more curves in the plane than there are points. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's known that F is one of the alpha numbers (alpha -two?) but it's not </i><br>
<i>&gt; known which one.</i><br>
<p>
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is known to be undecideable under current<br>
axioms of set theory.  Here is what Rudy Rucker says about possible<br>
resolutions, from Infinity and the Mind:<br>
<p>
"In the late 1960s, Kurt Godel did suggest some new axioms that would<br>
decide the size of C.  These were the so-called omega-square and<br>
aleph-one-square axioms....  At first it was thought that these two<br>
axioms, plus one other, implied that C = aleph-two.  But then Gaisi<br>
Takeuti showed that on the basis of the two square axioms alone, one<br>
can prove that C = aleph-one.  At present, there are no very popular<br>
axioms that imply that C is not equal to aleph-one, so it may be that<br>
CH will come to be accepted in the future.<br>
<p>
"One might hope that simply by thinking about C and aleph-one, one could<br>
decide whether or not CH is plausible.  In 1934, Waclaw Sierpinski did<br>
womething like this in assembling a book of eighty-eight statements<br>
equivalent to CH.  But none of these statements is obviously true or<br>
false - although in his famous 1947 essay, 'What is Cantor's Continuum<br>
Problem?,' Godel claimed that some of the equivalents of the continuum<br>
hypothesis were 'highly implausible.'"<br>
<p>
This is something they don't talk about much in math class - what do<br>
you do when your axioms have failed you and can't decide a question?<br>
What kind of reasoning works, how do you approach the problem?  It is<br>
related to such issues as Penrose's "proof" that Godel's theorem implies<br>
that machines cannot think.<br>
<p>
The question is whether the task of finding new axioms is itself one<br>
which can be described formally and axiomatically, or equivalently,<br>
one which can be captured in a computer program.  Or do we somehow<br>
have a non-axiomatic component which leads us to truth, as Penrose<br>
believes?  This problem might be a good test case.  It sounds like the<br>
preference is to set C = aleph-one, although maybe Godel was pushing<br>
for C = aleph-two.  Would Penrose claim that we have an infallible<br>
non-axiomatic intuition which guarantees that we make the right choice?<br>
I don't understand his argument well enough to know what he would say.<br>
