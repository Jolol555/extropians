<p>
One of the startling discoveries which came with the theory of relativity<br>
was that if we were ever actually able to communicate FTL, we could use<br>
this mechanism to send messages backwards in time.  This is part of the<br>
reason, up until recently, I'd been convinced that FTL communication was<br>
impossible.<br>
<p>
This is from the Relativity and FTL FAQ at:<br>
<a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/FTL_StartingPoint.html">http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/FTL_StartingPoint.html</a><br>
<p>
A situation which could take place if FTL communication were possible:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1.  As observers O and Op pass by one another (as they are shown in</i><br>
Diagram 8-1 ) Op uses some method to send out an FTL bullet from his<br>
reference frame. The event "O and Op pass one another" will be called the<br>
"passing event" from here on. <br>
<i>&gt;2.  The bullet strikes and kills a victim. This event occurs after the</i><br>
passing event in Op's frame of reference, but it occurs before the passing<br>
event in O's frame. <br>
<i>&gt;3.  A third observer is at the victim's side as he dies and thus he</i><br>
witnesses the death. This third observer is stationary in O's frame of<br>
reference (i.e. his frame is the same as O's), so the passing event (when<br>
the bullet was fired) occurs after the victims death in this third<br>
observer's frame. Thus, the third observer has witnessed a result which<br>
comes from an event in his future--he has information about a future event<br>
in his frame of reference.<br>
<i>&gt;4.  The third observer sends this information about the future to O using</i><br>
an FTL signal, and in the third observer's frame of reference, O can<br>
receive this information before the passing event occurs (and thus before<br>
the bullet is fired). <br>
<i>&gt;5.  O receives the message and learns of the victims death before the</i><br>
bullet is fired. He thus knows about the bullet being fired--an event in<br>
his own future which will occur at his very location. <br>
<i>&gt;6.  O uses this information to prevent Op from firing the bullet, thus</i><br>
causing a self-inconsistent situation--an unsolvable paradox. <br>
<p>
For the purposes of consistency, we may suppose that instead of sending a<br>
FTL bullet, Op actually sent an instant message to an assassin hiding<br>
behind a nearby grassy knoll, and that the FTL communique was his DigiCash<br>
payment.  :)<br>
