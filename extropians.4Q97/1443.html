No, to say I'm a verb is a metaphor based on the important role verbs play<br>
in syntax.  It's inaccurate to think of parts of speech as "being"<br>
concepts; nouns and words of description "point" to sections, categories,<br>
of our world-knowledge.  Verbs, however, are _not_ "names of actions."<br>
How is "to be," "represent," "accept" an action?  A verb is best defined<br>
as a unit which does verby things... show agreement with subjects, govern<br>
objects, hold sentences together.  Verbs are, perhaps, the best indicator<br>
of the _autonomy_ of language from the rest of thought; verbs are purely<br>
structural.  <br>

Agreed; e-prime and general semantics are wastes of time which perpetuate <br>
the ludicrous (in its strong form) Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. If you're<br>
interested in language, try linguistics.  Steven Pinker's _The Language<br>
Instinct_ is a good start; it pretty much sums up everything I learned in<br>
undergrade linguistics in a highly readable form.  Pinker, a<br>
psycholinguist who is the world's leading child language acquisition<br>
researcher, is also one of the loud proponents of evolutionary psychology.<br>
He makes a number of points that readers of this list should find<br>
interesting.<br>
