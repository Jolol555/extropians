Religion is about experience.  Most of the sophisticated or "world"<br>
religions have ethical systems, cosmologies, and various other gewgaws<br>
bolted on, but the reason you can't argue a religionist into an atheist<br>
is not a lack of mental ability on their part but because words and clear<br>
logic simply can't compare to the visceral, tangible, personal experiences<br>
they've had.  <br>
<p>
We may shake our heads and say, "Gosh, wasn't that Torquemada character a<br>
jerk?" but we have no grounds for assuming his spiritual experiences were<br>
any less personally profound than the Saharan sorceror's, the Promise<br>
Keeper's, or the Brahmin's.<br>
<p>
The real question in all of this is, what is the origin of the religious<br>
experience?  and is it necessarily a bad thing from an extropian<br>
perspective?  As someone on this list said a while ago, religions do a lot<br>
of commendable things; we just don't need the antirational baggage.<br>
That's one of the things that excites me, too, about the rave phenomenon.<br>
Lights, rhythm, and all that unleashed tension make for a hell of a<br>
ego-melting, tribal experience that has _nothing_ to do with dogma,<br>
philosophy, or propositional thought.  It makes me wonder what a<br>
consensual borganism might be like.<br>
