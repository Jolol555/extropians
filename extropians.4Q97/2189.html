Light never goes any faster or slower than light speed unless it is<br>
stopped dead in its tracks by  hitting solid matter. What happens to it<br>
is that its wavelength, or frequency changes. Short wavelengths have a<br>
lot of energy in them, while long wavelengths  have little energy. As<br>
light is pulled into a black hole, it gains energy as it falls. Since it<br>
can't speed up, its frequency merely goes higher and higher. A black<br>
hole has a deep enough gravity well that light generated inside the<br>
black hole, by the time it reaches the inside edge of the event horizon,<br>
has lost ALL of its energy, so the photon dissapears. Likewize, light<br>
entering the black hole's event horizon from other sources gains energy,<br>
and is bent in a trajectory. The event horizon is described as the<br>
altitude above the black hole at which the most energetic visible light<br>
is bent so much that it is trapped in orbit around the black hole. This<br>
is the true event horizon. There is also an apparent event horizon which<br>
is merely caused by the lensing effects the gravity field has on laght<br>
passing by the black hole, outside the event horizon, which varies in<br>
relationship to the distance of the observer from the hole. The farther<br>
away you are from the hole, the bigger the apparent event horizon seems<br>
to be. As you approach the hole, the apparent event horizon shrinks in<br>
size.<br>
