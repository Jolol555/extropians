This is clearly a sensitive subject.<br>
<p>
I don't want to engage in "rearranging my prejudices" on this one, but let<br>
me suggest that reasonable minds may differ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My reaction to Anton's posting has more to do with my reasons for </i><br>
<i>&gt;being on this list rather than the fact that he owns a gun.  I'm here </i><br>
<i>&gt;to work with others to find the new ways in which humans will move </i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond their present state.  I'm looking for the new stories that </i><br>
<i>&gt;will be told, and the new technologies that will take us there.</i><br>
<p>
These are all valid points. Anton is "guilty" of proclaiming his<br>
acquisition of old tech, and in that sense it is no more relevant than,<br>
say, my announcing that I bought a new "beater" $1000 car.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed </i><br>
<i>&gt;solely for the killing and maiming of other humans relates to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I will listen.</i><br>
<p>
Please don't interpret what I say as some sort of snap reaction. I've<br>
thought about your question for several hours now, and I think it's worth<br>
pointing out that your "solely" has a symbolic component. <br>
<p>
With respect, I'd like to point out that to a great many Russians, the SKS<br>
is emblematic as a tool that helped to save their Motherland from<br>
subjugation, and their wives and sisters from torture, rape and death, at<br>
the hands of the Waffen SS. <br>
<p>
Further, as a symbol in the eyes of aggressors, sometimes the intimidation<br>
factor is enough. This is a function in addition to the two you mention,<br>
and it is absent if only the aggressors possess the artifact carrying the<br>
said symbolic (and functional) content. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't </i><br>
<i>&gt;explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we </i><br>
<i>&gt;working towards, anyway?</i><br>
<p>
Again, important questions. I have the impression that functional diversity<br>
implies a sheaf of strategies. If posthuman society can exist in any<br>
meaningful sense, I suspect that some capacity to do violence will be<br>
retained by somebody. Who? Why?<br>
<p>
If what you mean is that you don't want to live in a world where violence<br>
is possible--well, I tend to agree; but I don't see how to get there from<br>
here, especially right now. This does not mean that the list should glorify<br>
violence, or the capacity for same.<br>
<p>
Let me reiterate that I am sincere in wanting to explore these questions,<br>
and in wanting to avoid kneejerk interchanges--even with a certain<br>
(*other*) "kneejerk". :)<br>
