Oil supplies have been "sufficient for 25-50 years" for as long as<br>
I can remember. Odds are they always will be.<br>

AFAIK every glacier in New Zealand has been increasing in length this<br>

These wouldn't happen to all be computer models based on the same<br>
assumptions, by any chance? Interesting that you quoted data for the <br>
last 150 years; thereby leaving out the very warm period at the beginning <br>
of the 19th century, where temperatures weren't much lower than today. Is <br>
this your idea of certainty?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;X-cuse me? The relation between increased CO2 matches the start of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;industrial revolution and the relative decreasing C14 concentration</i><br>
<i>&gt;correlated with statistical data on global usage of fossile carbon. </i><br>
<p>
I don't think anyone's questioning that we've dumped a lot of CO2 into<br>
the atmosphere. We're questioning the doomsaying about it causing <br>
massive global catastrophe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the consequences for the global food production (amongst many other things)</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be a big problem.</i><br>
<p>
You mean it will grow better with more CO2?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Exacly, if the current trend does not change we'll have burned 300 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;years of solar energy in about three centuries. It's been a nice kickstart</i><br>
<i>&gt;for out technical civilisation but we have to find better alternatives </i><br>
<i>&gt;pronto.</i><br>
<p>
So you agree that we need to keep the government from restricting our<br>
technological progress with unneccesary limits on fossil fuel use then?<br>
