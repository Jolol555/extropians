David Musick:<br>
<i>&gt;Anders suggests that violence comes from our deeply (biologically)</i><br>
<i>&gt;ingrained aggressive drives.  I agree with this.  </i><br>
<p>
I think that we have had this discussion before, but once again I <br>
am compelled to state:  Psychologists, biologists, and social <br>
scientists are not yet ready to state definitively what 'causes' <br>
violence, partly because it has origins in a complex of factors:  <br>
brain biology in *some* humans, cultural acceptance, the need to gain <br>
and maintain power, and inability to control anger.  <br>
<p>
Please, could we apply the same academic rigor to this topic that we<br>
apply to others!  I've got three bookshelves on the subject, <br>
entire libraries exist on it, and none of those scholars is willing <br>
to make the generalized statements on the topic that are being made <br>
here.  If we decide ahead of time what 'causes' violence, then we <br>
automatically shut off possible methods of dealing with it.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
