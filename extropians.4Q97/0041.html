&lt; The misinformation provided below can easily be dismissed upon a<br>
reading of an  unexpurgated edition of the old testament. For the<br>
highest degree of accuracy possible you may wish to use your favorite<br>
search engine for a view of the Dead Sea scrolls. As an alternative<br>
you may wish to learn Hebrew and Aramaic and read the Torah. &gt;<br>
<p>
I assume the "misinformation" you are referring to must be WesBurt’s<br>
claim that "The people of Israel never laid eyes on either the first<br>
two, or the second two, tables of the Law".<br>
<p>
I wasn’t really claiming this information was no longer available. I<br>
was responding to WesBurt’s arrogant citations of all the economic<br>
experts he had read and the implication that everyone else should do<br>
the same or else grovel silently at his feet.  <br>
<p>
Some people like to cite references (I’m guilty) while others (like<br>
Lee Crocker and Anders Sandberg) are more adept at condensing complex<br>
subjects into their own words.  Both approaches can add value.<br>
<p>
However, I think that suggestions for *everyone* to read the<br>
‘classics’ *as a first step* (not that YOU made such a suggestion),<br>
ignoring principles of comparative advantage and division of labor,<br>
are counter-productive in today’s rapidly changing memetic milieu.<br>
<p>
The recently discussed ‘Flynn effect’ probably results from the<br>
pressure of explosive accumulations of information and the development<br>
of tools such as FAQs and search engines (recently), along with media<br>
such as broadcast news and documentaries, reader’s digests and<br>
encyclopedias (in the more recent past).  As a child (in the Sixties)<br>
I recall *devouring* magazines and encyclopedias, almost from cover to<br>
cover, but only *browsing* the musty volumes of the Harvard Classics<br>
on my parent’s shelves.<br>
<p>
Anyway, a happy New Year to you too (every day starts one for me!)<br>
