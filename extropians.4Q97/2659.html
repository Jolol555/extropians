<i>&gt;From Kelly McGillis:</i><br>
<p>
I was at my hometown over the weekend and it was that time of early<br>
boring afternoon when recreational drugs are frowned upon, so I busied<br>
myself with quantum physics and the God Particle.  I was surrounded with<br>
my personal version of mathematical formulas when I was asked if I would<br>
babysit a whole slew of children while the mothers went on a shopping<br>
expidition.  I jumped at the opportunity, realizing that with all the<br>
practical adults out of the house, I could indulge somewhat.<br>
<p>
Soon I realized there were so many children running around the place<br>
that I didn't know what to do. They were totally out of control.  So I<br>
just shrugged and went back to my quantum physics.  I was at the point<br>
of proving that a wormhole existed in my brain when there was a HUGE<br>
crash.  It occured to me that perhaps the little ones were actually<br>
destroying my mother's house, so I jumped up and yelled "HEY!" and put<br>
my arm up like a police officer stopping traffic.  They immediately came<br>
to attention. "Don't you know that people who live in stone houses don't<br>
throw bricks!"<br>
<p>
"Yeah," one of em said, "And don't you know people who live in houses<br>
with Christmas trees shouldn't throw presents!"<br>
<p>
"Well, that would be stupid, breaking a present before you even opened<br>
it!  The fun is breaking them *after* you open them!"<br>
<p>
A tiny one was pulling on my leg.  "Aunt Kelly?"<br>
<p>
"And who are you," I said.  "Do you belong to this family? Or did you<br>
sneak in?"<br>
<p>
"I'm...I'm..I'mmm..."<br>
<p>
"I knew it!  Not only do I have a wormhole in my brain, you are not my<br>
nieces and nephews!  YOU'RE REPLICATING BEHIND MY BACK!"<br>
<p>
"I'm...I'mmmm..."<br>
<p>
"Good lord child, don't you know how to talk?"<br>
<p>
"Tory!  I'mmm Tory!  And stoooopid is a bad word Aunt Kelly."<br>
<p>
I eyed her suspiciously. This one was a replicant for sure.  Then they<br>
all started yelling at me that stooooopid was a bad word.<br>
<p>
"Okay, replicants!  That's enough!  Where are my real nieces and<br>
nephews?  What idiot told you stuooopid was a bad word?"<br>
<p>
Their teachers.  Their parents.  Every adult on the face of earth except<br>
me, I discovered.<br>
<p>
"Well, then, I'll just have to teach you a new word.  Say after me:<br>
REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSSS.  Use that word instead of stupid, OK?"<br>
<p>
"Aunt Kelly?"<br>
<p>
"Yes," I said warming up to the topic.<br>
<p>
"YOU ARE REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSS!"<br>
<p>
"Hey!  Who do you think you are?  A McGillis?"<br>
<p>
The parents thankfully arrived back and were appalled at the mess. <br>
Their kids, not my prob, right?<br>
<p>
One of my ridiculous sisters-in-law had the nerve to ask me when I was<br>
going to have children.  "NEVER!" I replied.  "It's my mission in life<br>
to be an aunt!  And its a mission I think I excel at!"<br>
<p>
"Yeah, and she's even got worms in her brain!"<br>
<p>
"That, you little replicant, is a worm hole!"<br>
<p>
