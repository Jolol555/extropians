<i>&gt; EFFECTIVELY intelligent as a supercomputer that is</i><br>

<p>
Not necessarily. If they are not too depresed, they might continue to <br>
do some work out of habit or fear of the consequences of neglect.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt; My guess is that what produces the feeling of</i><br>
<i>&gt; intrigue and interest is activity in some fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt; localised center of the brain, perhaps somewhere in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limbic system. &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the limbic STRUCTURE may be localized, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects "certainly circulate and are integrated into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the evolving global buildup pattern" [1].  Are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggesting that these 'feelings' are just some</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary spandrels that are no longer necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; as feedback mechanisms for other mental functions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can therefore utilize them for whatever we like?</i><br>
<p>
By no means! These structures are very necessary today. What I was <br>
saying was that in the future we might want and be able to change the <br>
way these feelings are triggered, so that they would only be <br>
triggered by thinking that might be practically useful. To put it <br>
more provocatively: art tends to be useless, so it would seem like a <br>
good idea to rewire us so that we no longer find art interesting, and <br>
to use other methods to get the pleasure or emotional experiences <br>
that we would have obtained from wasting mental resources on art. <br>
Unless, of course, we think that art is valuable in itself. (And <br>
unless and until such rewiring becomes commonplace, art will also <br>
maintain an instrumental value.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even limiting ourselves to genetic evolution, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to be implying that evolution has ceased over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the last few hundred thousand years; if so, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; please explain how white skin was "conducive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; fitness on the African savanna".</i><br>
<p>
I certainly did not intend to imply that. I used the reference to the <br>
African savanna only in order to vivify my point that what we find <br>
intellectually interesting today is (at least partly) dependent on <br>
our evolutionary prehistory. Many people seem to regard "pure <br>
intellectual curiosity" almost as if it were a sacred and <br>
unimprovable gift from God. (I do think it is a extremely valuable <br>
trait of character in humans, though.) But what is interesting is <br>
not, so to speak, a metaphysical truth; it is a contingent fact about <br>
human (and animal) psychology that we tend to find such things as <br>
complexity, variety and self-organization interesting. There is no <br>
reason why we should not change what we find interesting, if that <br>
would make us more efficient.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt; I therefore see no reason why the present</i><br>
<i>&gt; discrimination function by which humans discriminate</i><br>
<i>&gt; between interesting ideas or facts and uninteresting</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones could not be replaced by any other criterion one</i><br>
<i>&gt; might come up with, including the one that *every*</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea is highly interesting. &gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not to say that hedonistic engineering should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; taboo, only that it can't assume that all, or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; most, mental components can be replaced in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; plug-and-play approach.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, certainly we should not assume that.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt; These considerations suggest to me that while more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual curiosity, and its objective correlates</i><br>
<i>&gt; (such as diversity, information, novelty etc.) might</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very excellent things for people like us in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; world like the one we are living in today, it might</i><br>
<i>&gt; nevertheless  be overly anthropocentric to assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; that these things will also play a central role for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; superintelligence or a society of uploaded humans. &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless you're implying unlimited resources, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability to clone oneself to endless tasks (AND</i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow maintain a thread of cohesive experience), OR</i><br>
<i>&gt; a society of predominantly mono-functional agents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; why would the economics of incentives would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; radically different?</i><br>
<p>
You have a point, but let me clarify what I am arguing: Consider <br>
anger. It's an emotion that did more good than bad to the <br>
individual (or his genes) in our evolutionary past, but might <br>
nevertheless be maladaptive in today's world. Most agents nowadays, <br>
whether persons or countries, have enough intelligence and education <br>
that they would get better results if they control their anger and <br>
decide what to do by means of rational deliberation than if they let <br>
loose their wrath. Similarly, I suggest, with intellectual curiosity. <br>
That is another emotion. I thinkt that in the future we will have <br>
enough intelligence and knowledge that we will get better result if <br>
we decide what to devote our intellectual resources to by means of <br>
rational deliberation rather than following our instinct. As opposed <br>
to anger (which, it should be said, might still be useful on some <br>
rare occasions), intellectual curiosity has not yet become redundant <br>
as an instinctual guide to appropriate behavior, but as we learn more <br>
about the potential of different research fields, this will probably <br>
change.<br>
