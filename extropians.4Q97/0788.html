<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg gives a calculation of the thermodynamic efficiency of the</i><br>

<i>&gt; reasoning is slightly flawed. I'll show that the reverse is true, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; dyson shells may have a much lower temperature than previously thought</i><br>
<p>
I have spent this afternoon arguing with my office mate, filling the<br>
whiteboard with equations and having him look through thermodynamics<br>
textbooks. Our current consensus is that you are right and I was<br>
wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A heat engine works between two heat reservoirs with a temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference. A dyson shell works between the Sun which has a surface</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature of 5800 K and the temperature of its external radiators which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is initially at 3 K, the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. </i><br>
<p>
This has a maximal Carnot efficiency of eta_ultima=(5800-3)/5800 <br>
~0.9995.  So any dyson shell cannot become better than this.<br>
<p>
My mistake was that I calculated the efficiency of the shell to be<br>
(T_shell - 3)/T_shell, which is wrong since it is not the temperature<br>
difference between the cooling system of the shell and outer space<br>
that is used to do work.<br>
<p>
If we look at the system star+shell as a single heat engine, its<br>
maximal efficiency is eta_max=(5800-T_shell)/5800, where T_shell is<br>
the temperature of the shell radiators.<br>
<p>
It seems that our derivations of T_shell differ, since I assumed that<br>
the available work was expended inside the sphere, while you assumed<br>
it was expended outside in interstellar space. That resulted in my<br>
estimate of T_shell to [S/4*pi*r^2*sigma]^(1/4), and yours to<br>
(S/(4*pi*r^2*sigma*Th))^(1/3). Doing the work outside of course makes<br>
the system more efficient since the waste heat of the work in my case<br>
would heat up the radiators more and lower the efficiency of the<br>
entire shell.<br>
<p>
But you are right, the larger the shell becomes, the more efficient it<br>
is.<br>
<p>
Thanks for pointing out my error and making me learn more thermodynamics.<br>
