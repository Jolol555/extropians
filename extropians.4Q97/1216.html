<i>&gt; I have seen Randi in person.  He is very intelligent and a great showman.</i><br>
<i>&gt; His method of debunking, however, is not any more scientific than the psuedo-</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists.  Most of Randi's debunking logic goes like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  Someone "demonstrates" something unusual.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Randi fakes demonstration that looks like the same thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.  Since Randi's demonstration is fake, he claims he debunked the original</i><br>
<i>&gt;     demonstration.</i><br>
<p>
That's not quite right: (A) Charlatan claims to have some ability, or<br>
that some phenomenon exists.  (B) Charlatan performs a demonstration<br>
that he claims proves this phenomenon.  (C) Randi arranges to perform<br>
the same demonstration by trickery.<br>
<p>
(C) does not prove, nor does Randi claim it proves, that (A) is false,<br>
or that the Charlatan used trickery to perform (B).  It /does/ prove,<br>
however, that demonstration (B) is not sufficient proof of claim (A).<br>
<p>
Randi is also quite willing to show, in detail, a number of<br>
demonstrations that he is completely incapable of faking.  Since<br>
there are many such unfakable demonstrations, and every known<br>
demonstration of psychic phenomena is in the fakable set, that<br>
alone--while not proof--is strong statistical evidence that the<br>
phenomena are in fact faked.<br>
