Structural conservation would be just fine (functional proof is too<br>
restrictive, imo). However, it is technically most difficult to test. <br>
Maybe, with the advent of xray microscopy... It would help a lot if there<br>
was an encompassing theory of cryodamage. The exciting field of<br>
cryobiology does not seem to draw too many followers/funds, however. <br>
No-one hinders you from going out, and becoming a cryobiologist. Just<br>
never, ever say 'cryonics' in public. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Next, find existing chemicals that meet one or more of the specs.  There are</i><br>
<p>
It is that 'testing for specs' that is expensive. There is simply no<br>
certified easy/cheap/fast in-vitry model in existance, besides of the<br>
animal model (dogs/sheep), which is neither.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; already a few good cryoprotectants in use, but I mean any chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatsoever.  This is almost a form of brainstorming.  The idea is to widen</i><br>
<i>&gt; the scope of the search in hopes of a serendipitous solution.</i><br>
<p>
When it comes to choosing nomes de plume I'd avoid any combinations of<br>
'Visser' if I were you... <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; We can also use genetic algorithmns and the like to come up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; molecular design and try to create a compound or set of compounds</i><br>
<p>
Once again, you wouldn't be able to check much with your computer model. <br>
Personally, I think it to be the most promising approach on the long run<br>
(when we will have progressed to understanding the cell in terms of its<br>
molecular processes). This is strictly for the future, however.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; from the results.  This is sort of like crossing a butterfly with a bee to</i><br>
<i>&gt; come up with a graceful stinging bug.  Many of the crossbreeds will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be unviable monsters, but one might work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; After this, the cryoprotectant can be tested on nerve cells and perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks of nerves.  (Has such already been done?  I am talking about</i><br>
<p>
I once suggested using neural cultures on multi-electrode arrays for such<br>
a model on murg (functional check). I don't know whether anything ever<br>
came out if it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; examining the connections between cells -- which most assume are</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for how the brain behaves, including the mind -- for</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage.)  Finally, the cryoprotectant will be tested on whole systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as a whole mouse that is alive.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think fully reversible cryosuspension is physically possible, even<br>
on systems as small as the mouse. Mouse embryos, yes. Adult mice, no.<br>
