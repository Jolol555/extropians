First, some Caltech people have created the first neurochip: 16 neurons<br>
which can be linked together on a chip, so they're all connected to<br>
electrodes as well.<br>

Second: I've just finished Greg Egan's _Axiomatic_, and he is a cool<br>
author.  Extropian hard SF; what more can one ask for?  (A copy of<br>
_Diaspora_ is what.)  But what struck me most was his Ndoli device, or<br>
"jewel", which is an approach to uploading I don't think I've ever seen<br>
before, but which seems obvious after the fact.  It's a neural network<br>
implanted in the brain in childhood.  It receives the same input you do,<br>
and it's output is corrected by a "teacher" to conform to the output of<br>
your brain.  It doesn't actually do anything: it's just a backup brain<br>
inside your skull, but the identity isn't maintained by direct neural<br>
mapping, but by bullying a neural network to conform.  Later in life<br>
your brain can be scraped out and the jewel given control.<br>
<p>
I've only seen some form of scanning before, for uploading.<br>
Nondestructive (super CAT-scan) or destructive (unravel the brain by<br>
neurons, or the related in situ replacement of neurons.)  Imitation is<br>
new to me.<br>
<p>
It's not clearly easier than the older alternatives: you not only need<br>
to put a human in something much smaller than the meat-brain, but it<br>
needs to run at much lower power (otherwise you boil our brain.)  I also<br>
wonder about measuring the output of our brain; much activity is<br>
internal, and you can measure that, you might be able to do a direct<br>
scan.  Then again, if the jewel can be made to match your physical and<br>
verbal output for 10 years, one might presume congruence internally.<br>
<p>
I don't know if adult implantation could work -- Egan starts early --<br>
and it's useless for cryonics patients.  But it's still neat.<br>

Prowl, run, howl at the full moon<br>
I can't do it right, don't know why I try.<br>
Soon the moon will be rising<br>
Oh woe is the life of a werewolf.<br>
