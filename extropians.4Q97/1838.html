Don't want to nitpick too much, but your statement was "There are a<br>
multitude of other observed phenomena which align[sic] well with the<br>
theory of a closed universe, as well as theoretical reasons for believing <br>
that such a case is probable."  (The statement this contradicts is your <br>
qualified admission that "...I agree that current observations tend to <br>
suggest an open universe...")  The first part of that sentence seems<br>
to me to translate into there being _evidence_ for a closed universe.<br>
What is this evidence?  And why would there be good theoretical<br>
reasons if somewhere the theory did not match up with some facts?<br>
<p>
It appears the universe is open, but I'm interested in why, if it does,<br>
do some still maintain otherwise.  What reasons do they have?  And<br>
are these reasons valid and tractable?  In the interim, we might do<br>
well to discuss/try to understand the idea of an open, globally<br>
hyperbolic universe -- rather than be shackled to the current<br>
Standard model, which might become obsolete.<br>
<p>
One, but by no means the only, model of an open universe is that<br>
of David Layzer.  But even if his model is found to be faulty, any<br>
good theory of cosmology should be able to account for the fact<br>
that the universe has a lot less mass than would needed to close<br>
it -- given current observations.<br>
<p>
Please do not take the above to mean that I think science is<br>
ruthlessly empirically driven.  It is not -- at least, not in the<br>
fashion pure empiricists would have us believe.  Instead, I<br>
think it rest not on accumulating evidence, but on<br>
explaining/integrating wider fields of evidence.  (This is<br>
why, to try to add something to the quantum physics<br>
debate, classical mechanics has been superseded.  Post-<br>
classical theories (QM, QFT, QED, QCD, ST, GT, etc.) are<br>
able to explain more with less: more facts with less ad hoc<br>
hypotheses.)<br>
<p>
An aside: What are the probabilities and how are they<br>
measured in this area?<br>
<p>
Eagerly,<br>
