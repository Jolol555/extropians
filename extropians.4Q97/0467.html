Thanks for the suggestions so far. Keep them coming!<br>
<p>
Some responses:<br>
<p>
Kathryn: I'll try to take a look at the two you suggest. I believe Natasha<br>
has the Benedikt book. I've been wanting to look at the Fifth Discipline<br>
anyway. Any other especially good books on organizational structures?<br>
<p>
Eliezer: Hmmm, Godel, Escher, Bach *is* a superb book. I worked through<br>
that back when I was 18. However, as an overview of AI and cognitive<br>
science, I think that Hofstadter and Dennett's The Mind's I might be more<br>
accessible. (Or maybe I'll just include both, though this is supposed to be<br>
a select rather than comprehensive list.) Comments?<br>
<p>
For those who suggested more Egan books, I'll be happy to include more by<br>
one of my favorite SF writers. I'm not so keen on Permutation City, though<br>
may include it. I will definitely include his brilliant collection Axiomatic.<br>
<p>
Interesting disagreement over Unbounding the Future. I too found it far<br>
less stimulating than EoC but, as Anders notes, it may be a better intro<br>
for some people. I'll probably leave it in there, but placed after EoC. If<br>
the book list is annotated, I can explain which book to read depending on<br>
what the reader already knows.<br>
<p>
Anders: Tech Heaven may be a good cryonics story. Has anyone read Blake's<br>
book (i.e. Gregory Benford) whose title I cannot remember. I'd like to<br>
include *one* cryonics-related novel. I haven't read The Bohr Maker but<br>
will try to. I didn't much like Deception Well and don't see why it fits<br>
particularly well into this reading list. Out of Control is a good addition.<br>
<p>
John: I think some of your science book suggestions would be great for an<br>
extended reading list, but may not fit here. For instance, the many worlds<br>
interpretation of quantum mechanics is controversial amongst us (and<br>
doesn't seem a core extropian issue) so if I included that I would have to<br>
include several others from differing views. I'm just reading the Sagan and<br>
agree that it fits nicely in the list. The Martin Gardner will be good as a<br>
critical thinking booster.<br>
<p>
Create/Recreate will be included.<br>
<p>
Has anyone read Robert Forward's Indistinguisable from Magic? (I believe it<br>
used to be known as Future Magic.) I think it may be a good overview of how<br>
far science and technology can be pushed. Perhaps I'll get to read it on<br>
the plane this week.<br>
