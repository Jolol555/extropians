<i>&gt; A more daunting problem is that octopi do not seem to care for</i><br>
<i>&gt; their young in the way that other proposed candidates  -- e.g.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; chimps or dolphins -- for uplifting do.  The problem of each new</i><br>
<i>&gt; octopi, if this seemingly nonsocial lifestyle is maintained after</i><br>
<i>&gt; uplifting, having to learn everything on its own would make for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some limits on their potential.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, perhaps some form of  socialization is possible, even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; only in adult life.  How might this come about?  Is it really</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary?</i><br>
<p>
An ideal candidate therefore - if socialisation be the criteria - is the<br>
humble sea slug. The sea slug is perhaps the most copulent of all the animal<br>
kingdom, for when not eating and sleeping, the sea slug is more often than<br>
not found to be fucking. And let it not be said that sea slugs are<br>
traditionalists - they have shown a wide range of sexual appetites, even<br>
having been discovered going at with as many as six concurrent partners. <br>
<p>
Seriously though, surely by the time uplifting of octopi is possible<br>
suitably advanced methods for training them in the ways of the world will<br>
also be available? Assuming some kind of intelligence of the order of<br>
humans, basic literacy in the prevalent form of human communication would be<br>
easily administered, and who will say what would then limit our<br>
eight-tentacled friends?<br>
