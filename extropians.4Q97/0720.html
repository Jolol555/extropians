<i>&gt;IAN: Like a broken record, I find myself spouting </i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian doctrine even as I've seen the flaw in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the common application of libertarian moral theory: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a landlord uses force to evict me, or even if </i><br>
<i>&gt;the contract says if I break his rules I go to a </i><br>
<i>&gt;cell in the basement, libertarian doctrine does </i><br>
<i>&gt;not see this as coercion, so long as I'm free </i><br>
<i>&gt;to leave his property. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The federal government is the landlord of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;property known as the United States. The rules</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the landlord  must be followed or penalty</i><br>
<i>&gt;is effected.  It is not coercion so long as </i><br>
<i>&gt;you are free to leave the U.S. property if </i><br>
<i>&gt;you have a problem with the contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As we can see, the U.S. property arrangement</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not different than the "private property,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;for we are free to leave the U.S., therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt;the application of U.S. law is not coercion.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is an interesting argument.  I haven't heard it before.<br>
<p>
Libertarianism is usually expressed as an absolutist position,<br>
and I've yet to encounter an absolutist philosophy for which<br>
caveats cannot be found by extrapolation to a sufficient<br>
extreme.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The only difference between the smalltime </i><br>
<i>&gt;landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yet there is no libertarian rule that places </i><br>
<i>&gt;a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-</i><br>
<i>&gt;ing claims of Native Americans, but none of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the guilty are alive today. If we say that </i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so </i><br>
<i>&gt;too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-</i><br>
<i>&gt;bably stands on once Indian territory.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Actually, I read an article by some anthropoligist<br>
a year or so ago which suggested that Native Americans<br>
came across the "land bridge" which now forms the tip<br>
of Alaska quite a while back, migrated Southward and<br>
not only displaced but completely wiped out a race<br>
of PREVIOUS Native Americans.<br>
<p>
I wish I'd kept the article, or at least took notes!<br>
Does anyone have more info on this?  It certainly puts<br>
a new spin on the "America belongs to the Native Americans,<br>
we stole it, let's give it back" argument.<br>
<p>
There seems to be a similar situation in Hawaii, where<br>
the current Hawaiians are campaigning for cessetion from<br>
the mainland US, for a return to indiginous power, etc.<br>
Apparently the current Hawaiian population are descended<br>
from Polyneasians who completely wiped out the previous<br>
Hawaiians, the Mahunuae (spelling?).  The Mahanuae live on<br>
only in legend, as semi-mythical "little people", like elves or dwarfs.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think the importance of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;lies in the utility of private property,</i><br>
<i>&gt;such that people are more prosperous when</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals are allowed maximum control of</i><br>
<i>&gt;areas that they purchase in exchange with </i><br>
<i>&gt;others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)</i><br>
<i>&gt;that owns a vast area wants his tenants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prosper, he will allow them a very high </i><br>
<i>&gt;degree of liberty. He will allow them to </i><br>
<i>&gt;control parcels of land and trade them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What makes the market work is the ease with</i><br>
<i>&gt;which customers can exit a given establishment. </i><br>
<i>&gt;What makes government not work is the difficulty</i><br>
<i>&gt;with which customers can exist the country. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy</i><br>
<i>&gt;of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes down to size. This places emphasis on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixed and limited parcel of territory. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
History suggests that government's ability to legislate ownership<br>
of an area expands ALMOST as quickly as settler's ability to<br>
find new places to settle.<br>
<p>
Does anyone have a good argument that suggests this won't continue<br>
to be the case as we expand into space/cyberspace/wherever?<br>
