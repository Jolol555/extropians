    Actually yes.  Why do you think the food chain works the way it does?<br>
Animals die, and animals are born.  What happens if all the bobcats stop<br>
killing the rabits?  An over population of rabits, who use up all their food<br>
supply.  Not to mention the bobcats go hungry.  In nature its all a risk.  Some<br>
make it, some don't.  People don't really consider the fact that there might be<br>
laws to life.  I myself happen to believe there are.  All cause and effect.<br>
What do you think an ecosystem is?  The animals who die give life to others.<br>
The native americans knew this and respected it, only taking what they needed.<br>
We on the other hand take whatever we want more or less.  And it upsets the<br>
balance quite a bit.  Why is it do you think, that animals have been around for<br>
thousands of years, millions, and are still here?  They are part of a developed<br>
system of living, crafted and evloved over hundereds of millions of years,<br>
tested against time, and still here.  I think thats a pretty amazing feat dont<br>
you?  And here we come threatening to whipe out everything in just a few short<br>
thousand, which is nothing compared to how long the earth's been around.<br>
Wonder why there was never any global warming when animals still ruled the<br>
earth.  Just some interesting thoughts I've been comtemplating.<br>
