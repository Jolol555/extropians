The World Business Exchange (WBE) alternative<br>
currency system is being developed and launched.<br>
<p>
* Designed to become the perfect answer to the<br>
Federal Reserve and national bank monopolies.<br>
<p>
"Thanks very much for your submission to the Global Ideas Bank which seems<br>
unusually well thought out. It will be considered for the Global Ideas Bank<br>
editorially in due course and for the annual awards (deadline June 1st)."<br>
-- With best wishes, Nicholas Albery &lt;rhino@dial.pipex.com&gt;<br>
The Institute for Social Inventions   |  Tel +44 [0]181 208 2853<br>
20 Heber Road, London NW2 6AA, UK     |  Fax +44 [0]181 452 6434<br>
ISI/Global Ideas Bank is at &lt;<a href="http://www.newciv.org/GIB/">http://www.newciv.org/GIB/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
* Original proposal at: &lt;<a href="http://buildfreedom.com/eco15.htm">http://buildfreedom.com/eco15.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
* Places the money-issuing power in the hands<br>
of the individual.<br>
<p>
"The pinnacle of power today is the power to<br>
issue money." -- Thomas H. Greco Jr., author<br>
of 'New Money for Healthy Communities' --<br>
see &lt;<a href="http://www.gaia.org/ic/market/money/">http://www.gaia.org/ic/market/money/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
* Inflation-proof private currency that cannot<br>
be controlled by governments or international<br>
banking cartels.<br>
<p>
* Has the potential to help create a worldwide<br>
real free-enterprise economic system.<br>
<p>
* Has the potential to bring about an enormous<br>
decentralization of economic power into the<br>
hands of individuals.<br>
<p>
* Local and global Buy/Sell Directories.<br>
<p>
* Escrow transactions to reduce fraud and scams.<br>
<p>
* Encrypted transactions for privacy and security.<br>
<p>
* Encrypted communication module for members.<br>
<p>
* Low transaction fees (probably 1/2%) -- compare<br>
to 10% - 15% by many barter clubs.<br>
<p>
* The new currency will be convertible into gold,<br>
silver, platinum, and major national currencies.<br>
<p>
* Of great potential benefit to:<br>
(1) Anyone who has goods and/or services to trade;<br>
(2) Anyone doing business via Internet;<br>
(3) Any business wishing to expand its markets;<br>
(4) International traders;<br>
(5) Anyone involved with barter or countertrade;<br>
(6) Businesses and individuals with "expiring<br>
commodities" -- hotels, radio stations, airlines,<br>
restaurants, professionals, etc. -- e.g., if the<br>
hotel room isn't rented the revenue is lost and<br>
can never be recovered;<br>
(7) Freedom-lovers interested in economic freedom<br>
and private alternative currencies;<br>
(8) Promoters interested in earning commissions.<br>
<p>
* A special mailing list has been set up for those<br>
interested in learning more about the WBE system,<br>
and those interested in helping to develop and<br>
promote it.  You are invited to subscribe by sending<br>
a message to wbe-request@maillist.dundee.net with<br>
the word "subscribe" in the body of your message.<br>
