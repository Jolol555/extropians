Hi peoples especially Danny,<br>
Yes I'm new,...and I didn't mean to 'tar' anyone<br>
just wanted to know if there were more efficient <br>
ways to correspond ideas ( as agreed with Micheal<br>
Butler ) , I'm not against any ideas, that's the <br>
whole point,...I mean, truth stated is a benefit<br>
to all interested parties ( esp extropian ones )<br>
and meaniful information,...of course, anyone<br>
can argue what constitutes meaningful ; revelant<br>
information, so earth/moon relationship<br>
way to go,...<br>
Everyone should draw conclusions to extropian ideals<br>
and have these ideals been met, as a result of our<br>
'corresponding' so improving the 'ssnr' is a valid<br>
input...feedback anyone?<br>

im the one who posted it originally, my apologies,<br>
are you new and didnt readit?  I was referring to a<br>
picture i saw of the moon fit snugly inside a<br>
triangle fit snuggly inside the earth, making a<br>
perfect relationship, and so i turned my attention<br>
towards this list for my 'research and homework'<br>
after not receiving any replies from two separate<br>
astronomers i emailed (still havent actually), but it<br>
turned out to be false, pretty interesting if it were<br>
true though dont you think?  Now the attention has<br>
turned to when in the past this relationship could<br>
have existed, since the earth has been expanding. <br>
We're actually talking about something I dont think<br>
anyone else has talked about before, I think its<br>
worthy of discussion. It would be nice to have that<br>
date archived: when WAS the moon in that specific<br>
relationship with the earth?  Maybe it doesnt mean<br>
anything if it was, you could go on forever with<br>
relationships between moons and their planets and<br>
other moons and the sun, and im sure some interesting<br>
things would come up, and perhaps they would have<br>
some significance, so its good to try and find out.  <br>
