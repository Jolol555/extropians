I was looking from the perspective of the seller and not the buyer, and in a<br>
world of unrestricted power.  Surely, if I wanted a tropical rain forest, I<br>
would just think "I wan't a tropical rain forest" and there it is.  If I<br>
wanted a tropical rain forest as envisioned by Anders Sandberg, I'll just<br>
copy the parts of your mind filed under 'tropical rain forest creation' and<br>
use them to make my tropical rain forest.  That way I don't have to waste<br>
your time and I'm doing you a favour by increasing the amount of Anders<br>
Sandberg in the world.  That's my idea of an upload economy.<br>

<p>
Maybe you should be a self-regulating standard (that just gave me a really<br>
really good idea)  in the Sun/Java sense.  Instead of "Jump to Java", you<br>
could have "Skip to Sandberg"... maybe not.<br>
