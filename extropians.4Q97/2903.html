<i>&gt; From:          "Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko" &lt;sasha1@netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A few thoughts for your comments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the market, different agents bet that their own knowledge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation is better than their competitors'; the resulting price is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a weighed average of the bids.  An efficient/rational system, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition, is one that uses all its knowledge in an optimal way. </i><br>
<i>&gt; In this case, the optimal projection of the price would probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; arise if all traders assembled and put their fragments of knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; together (otherwise any dispute could be replaced by gambling). So</i><br>
<i>&gt; the market cannot be rational?  Or maybe it can be fixed by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; traders betting on some particular aspects of the market - the ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; they actually claim to understand.  For example, instead of having</i><br>
<i>&gt; meteorologists and trade analysts bet against each other based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; their partial knowledge of the situation, meteorologists could put</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward statements like "I bet that the floods will not destroy more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 5% of the crops this year", while the trade analysts will say</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like "I bet that if the floods do not happen at all, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government will stockpile 10 million tons of the product".  Then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody would put their bets on what they know, without the risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; of losing money from the reasons beyond their competence, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulting prediction would not only be more balanced, but will</i><br>
<i>&gt; include a model of the expected market behavior.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder if something like this has been tried or researched.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about any formal studies, but in all areas of the <br>
economy investors and investment managers are trying to get all <br>
relevant information they can and appropriately use it in their <br>
forecasts.<br>
<p>
So I don't know if (to follow your example) any firm that does a lot <br>
of investing in crop futures, actually employs meteorologists; but I <br>
will guarantee that many of them read long-range weather forecasts <br>
and have a pretty good idea just how accurate such forecasts have <br>
been in the last few years.<br>
<p>
All by impetus of the free market, without any government program to <br>
"rationalize" anything.<br>
