Matt Ridley's "Red Queen" makes a very convincing argument that<br>
the primary function of sexual reproduction is to increase the<br>
genetic diversity of the organisms to stay ahead of faster-<br>
evolving parasites.  Evidence for this contention includes the<br>
fact that there is a fairly good correlation between organisms<br>
that reproduce primarily sexually and those with long times<br>
between generations; and that isolated groups of normally sexual <br>
species that become too inbred die out not because of bad<br>
recessives but because of less effective immune systems (i.e.,<br>
if you're too close genetically to your parents, their germs<br>
have had 30 generations to adapt to them, and are likey to be<br>
well adapted to you too).<br>
