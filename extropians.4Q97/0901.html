In a message dated 97-10-27 22:55:10 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What keeps satellites in orbit is not that they are beyond the reach of<br>
 gravity, but that they are going sideways very fast.  Like anything thrown<br>
 sideways, their path bends downwards as they begin to fall.  However, they<br>
 are going so fast that after they have fallen 1 km, the earth below them<br>
 has receded more than 1 km becuse of its curvature.  So they keep falling<br>
 toward the Earth, but missing.<br>
 <br>
 What I said in my original post is that it is much harder to get enough<br>
 sideways speed to get to orbit than merely to get to 100 km of height.<br>

Is it possible to have a cord connected to earth as it's still freefalling?<br>
 Well, I guess it couldnt be attached to one spot on the earth, but maybe to<br>
a track or separate cord that went around the earth, and have enough leeway<br>
that it could stop temporarily at stations along the track to upload supplies<br>
or whatever into the cord connecting to the object in space, well i guess it<br>
would have to be a tube.  I dunno how it would get up there, perhaps some<br>
kind of suction system .  There's a problem with air resistance too.<br>
