Before anyone undertakes to exercise any of the techniques advocated by Mr.<br>
Mann to "exit the tax system," they would do well to review the several<br>
dozen cases outlined at the following "tax protester" website. All of the<br>
cases involve failed attempts by defendants to use one or more of the<br>
"legal theories" which generally abound for "escaping the tax system."<br>

I should point out that I am deeply opposed to taxation in any form.<br>
However, my opposition is on moral grounds--that being that taxation is<br>
robbery. I think that using "legal theories" as a basis for not filing<br>
returns and or not paying taxes serves only to affirm that authoritarian<br>
law has a place in civilized society and that taxation is A-OK (they just<br>
need an explicit law for it).<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes."</i><br>
<p>
One of the cases on the website concerns a lawsuit by an attorney against<br>
Schiff for breach of contract (failing to pay the reward). Schiff won the<br>
case and the appeal. However, strangely, Schiff's defense was not that the<br>
attorney did not provide proof that taxation was lawful and that average<br>
citizens are required to file and pay. Schiff's defense was that the<br>
acceptance of the offer was not timely (the attorney contacted Schiff after<br>
seeing a rebroadcast of the original program where the offer was made).<br>
<p>
While it's true that you have a good chance of not getting caught if you<br>
don't file, I think that has a lot more to do with the inefficiency of the<br>
IRS that it has to do with any "legal theories."<br>
