In a message dated 97-10-27 00:43:01 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Y'know, the ancient Incas also used  linear motor technologies. Just<br>
 look at the Nazca Lines. All those shapes can only be seen right from<br>
 the air, so of course, they had to have flying ships of some kind, and<br>
 all those lines are clearly landing strips for the Inca art critics to<br>
 get into the air so that then could evaluate the latest works.<br>
 <br>
 If you don't beleive it, yall are just repressing the technological<br>
 birthright of native americans, yall don't want to beleive that native<br>
 peoples had all this fancy stuff first but gave it up to live a more<br>
 pure primitive way, because it might infringe on yalls patent rights or<br>
 something...<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Ummm, that is actually the cool thing about those lines, that they DIDNT have<br>
technology to see it overhead, at least anything physical (dont underestimate<br>
the mind), of course they could have used tools to do it, such as measuring<br>
strings.  Does anyone know if those were made where trees were?  That would<br>
mess up using strings.  Im not sure how thats gonna get us to space without<br>
rockets though.<br>
