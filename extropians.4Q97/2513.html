Discussing gun ownership ,Kathryn Aegis" aegis@igc.apc.org said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How anyone can look in the eyes of someone crippled and maimed by one </i><br>
<i>&gt;of these tools and then joyously proclaim ownership of one is simply </i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond my limited intellectual capacity.  </i><br>
<p>
If that someone was a thug or burglar crippled and maimed by one of<br>
these tools then I'll look them in the eye and "joyously proclaim"<br>
ownership<br>
of one.<br>
<p>
It's been estimated (Shulman, "Stopping Power") that women use guns to<br>
defend themselves from rapists 416 times per year.  How do we look <br>
THEM in the eye when we confiscate their guns?<br>
<p>
Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, using surveys and <br>
other data, has determined that armed citizens defend their lives or<br>
property <br>
with firearms against criminals approximately 1 million times a year. <br>
In 98<br>
percent of these instances, the citizen merely brandishes the weapon or<br>
fires a warning shot.  Only in 2 percent of the cases do citizens<br>
actually shoot their assailants.  In defending themselves with their<br>
firearms, armed citizens kill 2,000 to 3,000 criminals each year, three<br>
times the number killed by the police.  A nationwide study by Kates,<br>
the constitutional lawyer and criminologist, found that only 2 percent<br>
of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified<br>
as a criminal.  The "error rate" for the police, however, was 11<br>
percent, over five times as high.  Evidence suggests that armed citizens <br>
are very responsible in using guns to defend themselves.  <br>
<p>
Guns are tools. They can be used responsibly, in self-defense, or they<br>
can<br>
be used irresponsibly by criminals or the careless.  <br>
<p>
Since violent crimes are frequently committed by repeat offenders, <br>
reserving prison space for them and having them serve their full<br>
sentence would put a dent in violent crime.<br>
<p>
Releasing violent criminals in order to make room for non-violent<br>
drug offenders imprisoned under mandatory sentences is foolish.<br>
I would like to ask the drug warriors how they look the victims of<br>
repeat offenders in the eyes as they release violent felons in the name<br>
of the WOD.<br>
