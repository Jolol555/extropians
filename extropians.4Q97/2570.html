Shawn Kendall wrote (in fun, but I still have a little rant in me) about the<br>
dark side of the pencil system.<br>
<p>
Although I won't try to deny the rough edges of pencils, I don't think an<br>
accounting of costs and complexities will tell you whether a thing is a<br>
dribble glass.  Just as the small number of key clicks to use a "keyboard<br>
shortcut" doesn't make it simple.  Simplicity and non-dribbliness are<br>
specific (and as I said, hard to explain) kinds of overall effect.  A too-<br>
easy association of realism with objective measurements is part of the<br>
problem here.<br>
<p>
For some of us, picking up a pencil can<br>
be like walking into a Japanese rock garden.  I would say, if your VCR<br>
or Windows 95 gives you that feeling, don't fight it, but if not, don't<br>
think it's you.  I agree that the pencil gets no exemption from that rule.<br>
<p>
In fact, I think with the idea of an "anti-dribble-glass" we've started<br>
falling into the ol' trap of wanting one toy to be the antidote to another.<br>
The antidote (or hope for, start of, one) is awareness.  As much as I<br>
like the pencil, it's not a savior, and no toy is going to be.<br>
