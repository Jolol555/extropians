The most interesting thing in the recent book I read about it was that<br>
it explained her pseudo-science as a response to the pseudo-science<br>
that came before it. <br>
<p>
Her book was seen by herself and her critics as part of the "nature vs.<br>
nurture" debate (in its original form - it was this historical period<br>
which gave the debate its popular name) which was a struggle between the<br>
ridiculous movement of eugenicism, stemming mainly from the work of<br>
Galton, and the anthropological school of thought of people like Franz<br>
Boas (Mead's tutor), who held to the other extreme of environment being<br>
all.<br>
<p>
She stated quite clearly that her intention was to give a boost to the<br>
"nurture" side of the controversy, and specifically to her master,<br>
Boas's representation of that side of the debate. And she did - so much<br>
so that the pendulum swung completely the other way, and from the 30s on,<br>
"nurture" was seen as all important, and culture was understood to have<br>
little or no genetic roots at all.  This was a hugely important book.<br>
<p>
Curiously, *before* this dumb pseudo-controversy, the general opinion<br>
was pretty much as it is today - both nature and nurture contribute<br>
something to the formation of culture and character.  Somehow the "nature"<br>
side got out of hand, and people one would nowadays loosely call "fascist"<br>
got a hold of the wrong end of the stick (which kind of gives some<br>
support to those who say that even if there's some truth in, say, claims<br>
that black Afro-Americans have a lower IQ than white Americans, you<br>
shouldn't broadcast that truth, because it only encourages wankers to use<br>
those claims to support their crackpot political ideas). <br>
<p>
In it's time, therefore, Mead's book served a useful purpose in<br>
(apparently) offering very strong, almost overwhelmingly convincing<br>
evidence on the other side.<br>
<p>
But all the same, when you look beneath the surface, the degree of<br>
wishful thinking and gullibility Mead displayed is quite sad, and there<br>
can be little doubt (in my opinion, based on this book I read) that most<br>
of her Samoan work has to be ditched.<br>
<p>
Another point that's of interest here is that Samoan anthropologists<br>
have been pissed off for years about the wacky ideas people have gotten<br>
about Samoan culture from reading Mead.  It is extremely ironic that<br>
leftist intellectuals have in fact "colonised" Samoan culture for their<br>
own, "Western" ends.<br>
