The Dawn Of Realization<br>
<p>
<p>
CANTO I.<br>
<p>
The prophet stood atop his mountain and looked across the lands,<br>
He could see the ebb of distant waves and the beach’s shining sands;<br>
The searing sun in the blue-white sky beat down upon his chest,<br>
And his eyes shone with a prudent fire, reflecting a heart professed;<br>
“The earth may turn, and the earth may burn” he’d solemnly recite,<br>
“How the day of this inferior world shall suddenly become night.<br>
 Hapless mortality and a humanesque malady afflicts me to the core;<br>
 The wasted potential of a race so existential when they should be so much<br>
more.<br>
<p>
 Are you ready for the circle --the everlasting Kingdom Come?<br>
 The storybook of glory and the mortal conundrum;<br>
 Are you willing to hear a tale of how we’ve all been dreadfully wrong?<br>
 Or are you ashamed of the past and present, and the future’s far too long?<br>
 For there always is an antidote to the world’s cascading disease--<br>
 The plague of falsified reason seemingly carried by the breeze<br>
 Shall always have a remedy where faiths and freedoms end:<br>
 The pinpoint of reality which hopes and fears will mend.<br>
 How far away is freedom...or is it truly not so far?<br>
 It all depends on the human race’s choice of peace or war.<br>
 How far are we from liberty if the concept has any worth?<br>
 The answer lies within the genes all have had since before their birth.<br>
 Is there a point to living life other than our wants or needs?<br>
 The truths beyond all wisdom’s end are planted like celestial seeds.<br>
 Will there always be authority to rely upon when we fail?<br>
 The tradition of all governments is the primal way we ail.<br>
 For authority is death --a fatal wound to the tortured souls<br>
 Who rely on outer forces to commandeer their roles;<br>
 But the death doesn’t end their lives, it just condemns them to live a lie<br>
 Within a doctrinated future, and a changeable historic tie.<br>
 And that is the saddest thing about the paradox of humanity:<br>
 United we are all blind, though on our own we can clearly see.<br>
 But that is all about to change...we are coming to the brink<br>
 Where mankind will see its flaws and finally begin to think.<br>
<p>
 We look to the desired ‘God’ to ease and nullify our fears,<br>
 We pray for resurrections of lost martyrs from lost years.<br>
 When the truth becomes so shrouded in the irrationality of a creed,<br>
 We seem to want a mystic escape, and a barrier from need.<br>
 We drown ourselves in dogmas --unpragmatic points of view--<br>
 To forget our worths and imports and remember things untrue;<br>
 We retain all rights and freedoms we have had since life began,<br>
 And we blame our lack of fortune on the mulishness of man.<br>
 Though we live with no true boundaries except those which we create,<br>
 We still have some desire to rely on ‘twist of fate’;<br>
 But the reasons are obscure and near impossible to find,<br>
 For the key to omniscient truths lie within each human’s mind.<br>
 Although mankind has never quite known where to draw the fragile line<br>
 Between reality and prophesy, rational and asinine,<br>
 Juxtapositional arguments slowly pollute the air<br>
 With absurdity and contradiction, through the gradual lack of care.<br>
 The intricacies of passion force all men to watch their say<br>
 Else the conversant double standards all but block the truest way;<br>
 The blatancy of romance makes a mockery of love,<br>
 With the force-fed faiths of flattery and the lack thereof.<br>
 So the dance between good common sense and its flimsy counterpart<br>
 Turns from a waltz into a tango, from a chore into an art;<br>
 In a war without a winner or a loser --so it seems,<br>
 The outcome is decided in the realm of clouded dreams.<br>
<p>
So the prophet pondered upon the world and all its numerous flaws:<br>
The heedful obeisance of mankind to superficial laws;<br>
And he came to the conclusion that there may well be a dawn--<br>
A plausible realisation, an ideal paragon.<br>
He nodded his head in surety of what he knew was right,<br>
That the darkness of society may one day come alight;<br>
He concluded that the possibilities are plentiful and vast,<br>
And that the future is wide open if man learns from his bleak past.<br>
