In a message dated 97-10-26 22:04:13 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Danny, Danny, Danny, think first. The earth is cooler now than it was<br>
 billions of years ago, right? Its no longer molten all the way through?<br>
 So due to contraction of cooling it should be smaller, right? NOT<br>
 bigger. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, the crust is only a few miles thick, and the propogation of matter from<br>
the core to mantle is part of the cooling process.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also thought I had explained to you that the fact that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;existing contintents being only so much area means absolutely nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with regards to the size of the earth</i><br>
<p>
actually its how the continents fit, so its not about area, but about how<br>
they are shaped, and by seeing how they fit, the only way they can fit<br>
perfectly is if the earth was smaller than it is now, 80% smaller.  So no the<br>
land doesnt affect the expansion of the earth necessarily, but it shows that<br>
it exists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;as well as that there is no way</i><br>
<i>&gt;the earth could expand due to material from the core moving out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Material flows in and out all the time, and the density is merely due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the gravitationally induced pressure of the weight of all the mass in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the outer layers pushing in. By your logic, the earth should be smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;since the outer layers have been pushing against the core for billions</i><br>
<i>&gt;of years, so they must have compacted it down more. (Y'know, like why</i><br>
<i>&gt;your cereal settles down in the box over time)</i><br>
<p>
This is your opinion, you dont know how the inner core/mantle relationship<br>
works.  Havent you ever heard of an expanding sun?  Things expand when they<br>
cool.  Anyway, this is just a theory to back up the fact that the earth was<br>
smaller a long time ago.  So, doesnt it seem obvious that the core is<br>
expanding into the mantle?  The core is 3 times denser than the mantle.  You<br>
say that the mantle flows in and out of the core, which of course you dont<br>
know for sure, but if this is true, at the same time couldnt less and less<br>
mantle be flowing back into the core?  Think yourself!<br>
