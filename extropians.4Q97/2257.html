I believe these point to be facts, but feel free to correct me.<br>
<p>
1.Increased atmospheric CO2 causes increased downward IR-flux <br>
  which could possibly lead to a temperature-rise of the biosphere.<br>
<p>
2.In 1958 a downward trend in the relative concentration of radioactive <br>
  C14 was discovered by Suess and attributed to burning of fossile carbon.<br>
<p>
3.In 1970 a clear upward trend of atmospheric CO2 was shown by <br>
  measuraments begun in '58 all over the world.<br>
<p>
4.Over a 18.000 year period the CO2 concentration increased from about<br>
  190 PPM to 280 PPM and then suddenly increased to it's present value<br>
  of 365 PPM over the last 200 years.<br>
<p>
5.During the latter half of this century there has been a solid<br>
  correlation between economic growth and increased consumption of<br>
  fossile fuels, were increase in fuel usage is tyically 1-3% greater<br>
  that economy growth in that year.<br>
<p>
6.Right now the developed nations are consuming a disproportionate part<br>
  of the global energy resources (the US consumes a 25% of all fossile<br>
  fuels produces while comprising only 5% of the global population).<br>
<p>
7.All humans living in Africa, Asia and the rest of the world have <br>
  just a much right to drive cars, have a TV and airconditioning but<br>
  if they do the global energy requirement will increase by (at least)<br>
  a factor of 5. Currently the known supplies of oil/gas are only<br>
  sufficient for 25-50 years (depending on your growth scenario) at <br>
  the current consumtion level.<br>
<p>
I'm an optimist but I cannot help seeing a _potentially_ very threatening<br>
picture emerging here.<br>

I hope you do not seriously expect that trying to describe anything as<br>
complex as the climatesystem would have been an instant succes. That just a<br>
ridiculous as expecting the rocketscientists of the early fifties to design<br>
a Saturn-V and expext it to perfom on the first flight. Of course things<br>
went wrong! The fact that mistakes have been made by certain people<br>
studying these issues in the past doesn't mean there can't be (and hasn't<br>
been!) progress in this field.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global </i><br>
<i> &gt;warming.</i><br>
<p>
Please state _one_ scientist whose work has been under the same scrutiny of<br>
peer-review as IPCC publications that dares to stake his reputation on the<br>
theorie that the CO2-increase of the last 200 years is preventing another<br>
ice-age.<br>
<p>
AFAIKT almost every glacier on this planet has been retreating during this<br>
century and the is _no_ indication whatsoever that there's another iceage<br>
around the corner. And even if there was it's not something that is going<br>
to happen in decades but over a period of several milennia.<br>
<p>
And the fact that this argument is never heard in discussions at policy<br>
level might be an indication that it is not taken seriously by the broad<br>
community of scientists (even PR-people of big oil companies _never_ use<br>
this argument!).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may be </i><br>
<i> &gt;that you are wrong about the solution. The fundamental need is to </i><br>
<i> &gt;increase the amount of organic matter.</i><br>
<p>
Trees are stable biomass. It may be that more CO2 'bonding' can be done by<br>
oceanic plankton as was noted by Michael Lorrey. However, these cannot be<br>
more than temporary solutions since the global emission of CO2 is<br>
increasing exponentialy and will continue to do at least so for some time<br>
(there's a lot more coal to burn).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If your solution compels poor </i><br>
<i> &gt;people on marginal land to continue the agricultural practices now </i><br>
<i> &gt;turning that marginal land into desert, you are being counter-productive.</i><br>
<p>
I have no idea where you got this idea and of course it's also necessary to<br>
try to foster sustainable land-use in poor countries. This is just a part<br>
of a much bigger general education problem. If farmers on the edge of<br>
desert can be educated about these things that will be a very big plus<br>
(just as education about family planning and basic health).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what Clinton </i><br>
<i> &gt;proposes US businesses should pay out of their own pockets each year </i><br>
<i> &gt;to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to dumping dusts of </i><br>
<i> &gt;metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern oceans, we might </i><br>
<i> &gt;solve the problem not only for the US, but for the entire world.</i><br>
<p>
I've heard proposals to dump animals waste (a lot of that in Europe, and<br>
no-one knows what to do with it) in so-called 'oceanic deserts'. These are<br>
area's in the oceans that do not contain minerals (maily nitrogen) required<br>
for basic plankton life and are mostly lifeless because of it. The<br>
introduction of nitrogencompounds could start a whole foodchain that would<br>
bond many megatons of carbon. The high cost seems not to be getting it in<br>
the middle of an ocean but to get is from the farms to the ships, after<br>
that: no problem.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The major problem with that claim is that identifiable sources of </i><br>
<i> &gt;possible error convert it to something on the order of "The global </i><br>
<i> &gt;temperature is someplace between two degrees colder and three degrees </i><br>
<i> &gt;warmer than a century ago, with the most likely value being half a </i><br>
<i> &gt;degree warmer."</i><br>
<p>
The statistics are difficult, but if you superimpose temperature data<br>
concerning the last 150 years from Vinnikov, Groveman and sources like CRU<br>
and GISS the similaritiest are striking to say the least (and so is the<br>
upward-trend).<br>
No, there's no certainty yet. I do not think we can afford to wait for<br>
absolute, 100% certainty.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The other problem is that to the extent that we can track WHEN this </i><br>
<i> &gt;change occurred, it appears that about 80% of the effect occurred </i><br>
<i> &gt;*before* 80% of the alleged cause.</i><br>
<p>
X-cuse me? The relation between increased CO2 matches the start of the<br>
industrial revolution and the relative decreasing C14 concentration<br>
correlated with statistical data on global usage of fossile carbon. There<br>
is very little doubt were all this 'new' carbon comes from, the extent of<br>
it's effect cannot be determined yet but there are many indications that<br>
the consequences for the global food production (amongst many other things)<br>
could be a big problem.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; How can we say that? There was a happy ecosystem, yes. There was</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; not a happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to live near</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;No significant evidence of major change in swamp area as a result of </i><br>
<i> &gt;temperature changes in this range. No significant evidence of </i><br>
<i> &gt;non-trivial shoreline changes. No significant evidence of changes in </i><br>
<i> &gt;flooding patterns. </i><br>
<p>
Not yet, but that may very well be because there's a delay between cause<br>
and effect (not unusual in large systems). A two degree temperature<br>
increase in the sub-tropics could very well enlarge the habitat for<br>
malariamosquito's causing 50 million additional deaths yearly (mainly in<br>
third-world countries). Already research in Colombia, Ethiopia, Pakistan<br>
and Papua-New-Guinee has shown that malaria is becoming more frequent in<br>
higher area's, this could be greenhouse-related.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;DIFFERENT plants grow well, but the basic level </i><br>
<i> &gt;of biodiversity is not significantly affected. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I've understood Homo Sapiens is the biggest threat to biological</i><br>
diversity since whatever killed the dino's. Normal development of the<br>
eco-system is replacement of about one species per year (based on fossile<br>
records). Current extinction rate is anywhere from 10 to 40 species per<br>
_day_. But all this not not necessarily related to greenhouse (more with<br>
the McDonalds burger farming on poor Brazilian soil and the western lust<br>
for tropical wood).<br>

It could be already too late, but since we're not sure either way let's<br>
work with the assuption that we can make a difference, it's a helluvalot<br>
more motivating and fun.<br>
<p>

Exacly, if the current trend does not change we'll have burned 300 million<br>
years of solar energy in about three centuries. It's been a nice kickstart<br>
for out technical civilisation but we have to find better alternatives pronto.<br>
<p>

<p>
Yes, better to use them for plastics and composite materials.<br>
So how are electric cars doing? I understand Ford has a model that is ready<br>
to be _used_. <br>
