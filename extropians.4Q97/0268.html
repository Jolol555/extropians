Michael Lorrey suggested:<br>
I'd think that the easiest fix would be to start building chips in three<br>
dimensions, as cubes.<br>
<p>
Gregory Sullivan says:  <br>
There is a recent multi-part interview with Gordon Moore at the Scientific<br>
American site. In part three of the interview he talks about the<br>
technologies that might allow the continuation of Moore's Law for a while<br>
longer, e.g., EUV extreme ultraviolet, bigger wafers.  He also talks about<br>
how it is easier to do multiple layers now which is relevant to partially<br>
exploiting the third dimension. <br>

Excerpt:<br>
<p>
SA: How about adding more layers to the chips? <br>
<p>
GM: More layers are something we do now without much concern.  Going from<br>
one to two was tough, two to three was difficult, but five to six--piece<br>
of cake. A technology has come in there that is really amazing. This is<br>
the idea of chemical-mechanical polishing of the top surface. The problem<br>
used to be that as you went through more layers, the polishing got all<br>
screwed up. You'd get mountains and valleys and undercut levels, and<br>
things didn't work well.  Now between putting down every layer of<br>
insulator and metal, we polish either the top of the metal or the top of<br>
the insulator flat. So we're always working on a flat surface. And that<br>
has really been a breakthrough technology in allowing multilayer<br>
structures. <br>
<p>
SA: How exactly do you polish them? <br>
<p>
GM: We have a great big lapping machine with some goo on<br>
there--chemical-mechanical, it's called. They use slurries that also react<br>
somewhat chemically with the surface. It's not just grinding. But it gives<br>
them a very flat surface. The end result is, we put five layers on top of<br>
each other and then ask the design engineers, "Would you like another<br>
layer of metal?"<br>
<p>
SA: Do you think that trend will continue, that chips will get even<br>
taller?<br>
<p>
GM: I think it will, yes. I think that's one of the real levers we have to<br>
work with.<br>
