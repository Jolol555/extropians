Hmmm, perhaps I've been thinking about this wrong.. What about simple<br>
differences between the rates of typical human growth. For instance, I'm<br>
6'5" and was almost six feet before age 11. My girlfriend (ironically) is<br>
about 5'3 and can still wear the same clothes that she wore at age 11.<br>
<p>
Are there measurable hormonal levels or other factors which can be<br>
atributed to say, my accelerated growth? Since we were originally<br>
discussing how we could grow human body parts to adult size in a short<br>
period, could we then just manipulate the chemical relationships which<br>
naturally exist in the body to encourage a hyper-growth state???<br>
