     Is your web site the best kept secret on the Internet?<br>
<p>
     We'll promote it to 50 search engines and indexes for $85<br>
     and complete the job in 2 business days.  Satisfaction is<br>
     guaranteed!<br>
<p>
If you have a great product, but are not getting many inquiries from<br>
your Web site, you may not be adequately listed on the Web's search<br>
engines and indexes.<br>
<p>
Millions of viewers daily use these facilities to find the products<br>
and services they are looking for.  But if your site is not listed, no<br>
one will see it.<br>
<p>
Listings on most of these services are free.  However, locating and<br>
filling out the forms required to get a listing can take several days,<br>
and most people just don't have the time to do it.<br>

<p>
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?<br>
<p>
