But using components specialized for being brains might slow you<br>
down because it's harder to get chips designed and built than to<br>
program PCs.  On the other hand, such brain-chips could already<br>
have become an industry by 2027, used inside insect-robots or spy<br>
cameras starting a decade earler...<br>
<p>
That's really inspiring, man<br>
<p>
How about organic interfaces e.g. processor drivers to nerve<br>
tissues ; neuro-chip replacement for spinal nerve connection<br>
etc etc ,... that's going to be a reality as well ...<br>
so that people like Christopher Reeves could possibly be walking<br>
again by 2027 or earlier , right ?<br>
