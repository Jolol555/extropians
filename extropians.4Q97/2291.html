<i>&gt; &gt; I seem to remember a Scottish study (sorry, no references ;( )</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that found a steady decline in sperm count for Scottish men in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; last couple decades. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps a decline in the practice of wearing kilts? : )</i><br>
<p>
Actually, that *is* a plausible explanation.  (For verification it <br>
would be helpful to determine if there really was a decline in <br>
kilt-wearing.)<br>
<p>
The male scrotum is a temperature regulation device: it shrinks or <br>
enlarges in an attempt to keep the testes at an optimal temperature <br>
by adjusting their distance from the body.<br>
<p>
It has been observed in the US that snug underwear  (confining the <br>
testes close to the body and providing them with a snug coat as well <br>
--&gt; overheating) causes a drop in sperm counts.  This is an easily <br>
reversible change, though, usually fixed by having the man switch to <br>
boxer-style briefs.<br>
