I doubt it. You don't dig up the foundation to your building just<br>
because its nice and solid.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; or land a comet on Mars to terraform ?!</i><br>
<p>
Oh, now your getting into my favorite subjects...To anyone interested in<br>
terraforming Mars, I suggest you read Kim Stanley Robinson's _Red_Mars_<br>
trilogy, which is possibly the most scientifically realistic view of<br>
mars terraforming I've ever seen.<br>
<p>
Essentially, it is thought that there is enough CO2 in the poles and un<br>
the rocks that if the atmosphere could be heated up a bit, it would<br>
automatically cause a process of outgassing that would raise Mars'<br>
atmosphere up to a level of between 300-500 millibars, almost all CO2.<br>
THis is equivalent to atmospheric pressure in Lhasa, Tibet. <br>
<p>
At this level, greenhouse effects would raise the average equatorial<br>
temperatures to around 50 deg F. It is not known how much water there is<br>
on Mars, but it is thought from current data that there is enough to<br>
fill the northern hemisphere with a 1 million sq kilometer ocean with an<br>
average depth of 100 feet or so, at the above cited atmospheric temps<br>
and pressures. In order to make this atmosphere livable without oxygen<br>
masks, we would need to seed the planet with engineered plantlife. This<br>
oxygen conversion will of course reduce the greenhouse effects, thus<br>
cooling the planet, unless we replace the lost CO2 with other greenhouse<br>
gasses, like CFCs, methane, etc. It is doubtful that there was enough of<br>
a period of lifebuilding on mars in the past (if the current evidence<br>
supporting such life is confirmed), to provide adequate fossil fuel<br>
resources, so all energy will come from solar or nuclear power<br>
<p>
It has been proposed that if somewhere between 2-5 comets were dropped<br>
on mars, this would provide the necessary heat, additional gasses for<br>
accelerated pressurization, and additional greenhouse gasses to maintain<br>
a stable atmosphere, with  a later need for production of CFCs  at a<br>
level of between 5-10% of current terran production.<br>
<p>
As for exploration of comets, its a needed mission. As the Huyakutake<br>
and Hale-Bopp comets showed us, there are plenty of objects out there<br>
that are undiscovered that could show up at any moment. if we are to<br>
come up with concrete plans to divert earth intercepting objects we need<br>
to know exactly how  such objects are built so we know whether to use<br>
nuclear explosives or land nuclear thrusters, etc. We also need to do<br>
the same with asteroids of the near earth variety. This precautionary<br>
program would then be the harbinger of an asteroid mining industry.<br>
<p>
As for NASA and JPL, well, they do good work, but, dammit, they are<br>
substituting manned exploration with VIDEO GAMES!!! I think its entirely<br>
BS of the highest magnitude that we are putting up with the current<br>
"smaller, faster, cheaper, less imaginative, less risky" program. Then<br>
again its about time people saw how incompetent big government programs<br>
are at exploration. <br>
<p>
BUckyballs? I think that once we get buckytubes made in sufficient<br>
lengths to weave with to make Fuller forms, we can then start thinking<br>
about mega scale projects. Is anyone on the list working with the<br>
tubes????<br>
