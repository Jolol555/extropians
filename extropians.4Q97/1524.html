The New York Times editorial "Conspiracies, Real <br>
and Imagined"  (11/14/97)  falsely states that: <br>
"Mr. Goddard now says he INVENTED the tale [the <br>
Navy-Missile theory] to give the Government a <br>
'black eye.'"  (emphasis added)<br>
<p>
I was contacted by Matthew Wald with the New York <br>
Times the day the CNN story hit, over a week before <br>
that NY Times editorial. I explained to Mr. Wald <br>
that I never admitted to perpetrating a sham or a <br>
hoax, that I have only presented eyewitness accounts <br>
and press reports pertaining to military activity <br>
on July 17, 1996. I "invented" NOTHING. I was even <br>
a relative late comer to the USN-TWA theory.<br>
<p>
I also sent him all the messages I have sent here. <br>
But nevertheless, the New York Times ignores what <br>
I actually say and instead they say that I said I <br>
invented the whole thing. Clearly, they chose to <br>
publish the false over the true. Why???!!<br>
<p>
This is a naked farce, a deliberate attempt to <br>
destroy the truth, the Navy-missile theory, and <br>
me to boot. Why would they do this? Other reports <br>
claim I wrote the so-called "anonymous Internet <br>
document," which was written by former 747 pilot <br>
Richard Russell. The unrelenting year-long sweep <br>
of disinformation throughout the media points to <br>
only one logical answer to that question: there <br>
is a massive media-wide cover-up underway. <br>
<p>
I have spoken with reporters who tell me they can-<br>
not cover witnesses accounts. When I ask why, no <br>
answer is given. All the major network programs, <br>
even fringe programs like HARD COPY, refuse to show <br>
the radar tapes, except a 2 second flash by Prime <br>
Time Live that prevented any meaningful perception <br>
of their content. Richard Russell, who had extra <br>
copies he forgot to give the FBI when they took <br>
the masters, has tried and tried to get media to <br>
show the tape, with no luck. It's authenticity is <br>
not in question. The FBI has conceded authenticity. <br>
It's a fact that Russell has inside contacts. The<br>
FBI has been interrogating his friends in an <br>
effort to track down that contact.<br>
<p>
The evidence is clear that there is a clamp down <br>
on all evidence pointing to Navy culpability and <br>
there is an agenda to destroy those pushing the <br>
case, particularly yours truly. It's all right <br>
there for anyone to see. It seems clear that it's <br>
a national security issue, and that under such, <br>
it's Marshall Law regarding the issue of TWA 800. <br>
<p>
Pointing in this direction is the fact that on <br>
the very same day (03/11/97) the FBI learned that <br>
Russell had the radar tapes, showing a possible <br>
Navy missile, and went to get the tapes, President <br>
Clinton signed Executive Order 13039, which excludes <br>
the Naval Special Warfare Development Group from <br>
federal whistle-blower protections for reasons of <br>
"national security." The SpecWarDevGru is involved <br>
in the littoral (coastal) Cruise Missile Defense <br>
program which seems to be what was happening off <br>
Long Island during the "Global Yankee '96" military <br>
exercises taking place off L.I. on July 17, 1996.<br>
<p>
You can see this eye-opening Executive Order here:<br>

<p>
E.O. 13039 went into effect one day before the Paris <br>
Match article came out showing photos of the radar <br>
tapes. I believe they fear any favorable media <br>
coverage such as the Match article, because this <br>
creates an atmosphere that could encourage "loose <br>
lips." It could make the suppressed feel it was safe <br>
to come out, that someone will listen. It seems that <br>
the master planners panicked when they realized the <br>
radar data was out and rushed to exempt the key Navy <br>
R&amp;D group from whistle-blower protections.<br>
<p>
Allowing a fair degree of obvious media oppression <br>
may be determined as necessary to signal those that<br>
might speak up, that your dead meat if you do...<br>
look how we cooked Goddard's ass. If a Navy person<br>
came forward, they'd say he was perpetrating a hoax<br>
for money, for fame, to get back at his superiors...<br>
<p>
This is one of the most massive cover-ups in history. <br>
Anyone who takes the time to read a few of my short <br>
reports will see the utter transparency of it:<br>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm</a> <br>
<p>
I have PROVEN that there is a cover-up:<br>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm</a> <br>
<p>
I believe that my having shown its transparency is <br>
the reason I've been taken out to the woodshed by <br>
the GovtMedia for spankings over and over this last <br>
year. My butt got so sore I said I was sorry, but <br>
then they whipped my ass harder anyway, so why <br>
apologize? Hell... maybe I'm a masochist.<br>
