<p>
Actually I find that the Singularity stays about 20-30 years in the<br>
future.  I'd like to see some evidence that anyone in 1980 predicted it<br>
to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew<br>
about the Singularity back then.<br>
<p>
20-30 years is enough time for significant changes in technology and<br>
in society.  When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible<br>
that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter<br>
could occur in that time frame.  In fact, technology has not advanced<br>
as fast as was expected back then, at least not in those areas.  AI has<br>
been 20-30 years away since the 1950's.<br>
<p>
Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology<br>
in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller<br>
indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage<br>
can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of<br>
the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies<br>
will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there<br>
is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.<br>
<p>
It's our old friend, the S curve.  Right now the growth in performance<br>
looks exponential, just as the increase in sewing machine speeds (or<br>
virtually any other industrial performance measure) looked exponential<br>
at one time.  But they hit a limit back then, and we will probably hit<br>
a limit ourselves now.<br>
<p>
That doesn't mean that progress will stop; all the ramifications of<br>
the information revolution will continue to develop even if computer<br>
performance tops out a few orders of magnitude better than we have<br>
it today.  And there are other technologies which are poised for growth,<br>
biotech of course, and possibly materials science, microtech, etc.  These<br>
are probably going to be the hot fields of 2010.<br>
<p>
But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can<br>
guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond<br>
20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined<br>
to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though<br>
things often take much longer than we expect.<br>
