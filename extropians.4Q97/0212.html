: ... What I'm frustrated about is the way<br>
: in which the group concerns itself with libertarian issues, tax<br>

: system to a libertarian one, or to any other substantially different<br>

: can be completed.<br>
<p>
That's one view.  Another view is that any functioning economy is,<br>
by necessity, already largely libertarian.<br>
<p>
: Basically, IMO libertarianism is a philosophy that<br>
: describes one way in which a human society can constitute itself. But<br>
: human societies don't generally change rapidly without a great deal of<br>
: distortion and pain.<br>
<p>
Well, isn't rapid social change what we're all predicting?<br>
<p>
: I simply don't feel that such a rapid change is<br>
: justified. The existing setup is good enough to see us through to the<br>
: singularity without an earlier politico-economic revolution. ...<br>
<p>
Ah, there's the key disagreement.  I don't believe the existing<br>
structure can last; can't you hear it creaking?  We're going to see<br>
either widespread defection and escape into the "underground" economy,<br>
or abandonment of the substance of constitutional government, if not<br>
both, by 2010 at the latest.<br>
<p>
A few years ago I predicted constitutional crisis in 12 years,<br>
and someone promptly offered to bet that it would come sooner.<br>
