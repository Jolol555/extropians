<i>&gt; 'Extropians' is supposed to be an intelligent 'flame-free' venue...</i><br>
<p>
Since when is that a goal, or for that matter, even possible?<br>
I certainly don't think such a thing is possible.  In an open,<br>
unedited, unmoderated forum such as this, a "civilized" thread<br>
of discussion is compeltely useless.  If nobody is pissed off,<br>
that's a sure sign that little of importance is being said,<br>
or else the subject is so obscure not enough people understand<br>
it to have an opinion.<br>
<p>
Anything everyone agrees on has, by definition, no useful<br>
information content.<br>
<p>
Now, since every time I make this point, someone misunderstands,<br>
let me be clear: I'm /not/ saying that pissing someone off<br>
should be the purpose of a statement, only that any statement<br>
that merits thought is likely to piss someone off, so it's a<br>
very bad idea to try to prevent that, because you will wind up<br>
preventing useful thought.  It is far more effective to teach<br>
listeners tolerance than to expect it of speakers.<br>
