I'd have to disagree, the rush to buy Pentium 2's is huge.  Nobody wants<br>
anything below a 233MXX and usually go for the Pentium 2.  Oh! And the<br>
sequal to Quake, Trinity won't use 3D cards, it'll be software only (as will<br>
most next generation 3D games, cos the cards don't do the right sort of 3D)<br>
so you're going to need that P2.<br>

Any chance of converting you to something more extreme - absolutely NO<br>
POLITICS!!!???  Just thought I'd ask.<br>
