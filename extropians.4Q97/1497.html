<i>&gt; ...This does not mean that the fundamental fact that Chomsky</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognized is invalid, namely, human minds are built for language, build</i><br>
<i>&gt; it in childhood using the terribly poor, incomplete examples around them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and invariably build it along identical lines.  This has earned him the</i><br>
<i>&gt; eternal wrath of cultural relativists who want human nature to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; alterable; of course, we want our nature to be alterable, too, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists recognize we need to change the hardware to do so.</i><br>
<p>
I'm certainly not big on ducking reality; I have no doubt that our<br>
minds are wired by evolution in specific ways, and that it is good<br>
to study those ways.  I have little patience for those who believe<br>
otherwise for whatever reasons.  But what better way to study them<br>
than by deliberately attempting to flout them?  Indeed, how else<br>
/can/ one study limits and capabilities except by trying to exceed<br>
them (and learning from our failure)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The acid test for Lojban would be, can children learn it and not creolize</i><br>
<i>&gt; it?  If children are exposed to Lojban as a first language and what they</i><br>
<i>&gt; create based on the evidence available to them is basically the same, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; conforms to UG.  If they alter it radically or minutely, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lojbanists have made some fundamental mistakes about how to create a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language usable by humans which makes logical relationships explicit.  </i><br>
<p>
If those children do alter it, then /that fact/ will tell us more about<br>
the nature of the fundamental capabilities of the human mind than any<br>
amount of study on existing languages.  Far from being a failure of the<br>
Loglan project, it would be a great success (though it would be a<br>
failure of the language itself, perhaps).  It is precisely because Lojban<br>
is so alien to the way things are done in evolved languages that makes<br>
it a useful data point.  I also think it would be a useul language--<br>
perhaps not as a primary, but as a secondary one.  Both of those<br>
conjectures are subject to experiment.  I participate in the latter;<br>
I'll have to wait until I have children to participate in the former.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Age of a science is not a requisite for the accuracy of its theories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, linguistics is a young science.  Our universe has existed for more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 15 billion years; is it irresponsible or hubristic to draw</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusions about the way it behaves because physics has existed for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tiny fraction of that?</i><br>
<p>
Touche.  That was a rather stupid thing for me to say.  The idea I<br>
was trying to get across is that for the sake of studying how the<br>
human mind is wired for language, the set of all human languages is<br>
a rather small sample.  I'd like to see more outliers in this set:<br>
Lojban is a good one, but I can imagine even more strange ways to<br>
construct a language that might tell us more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am not one who takes a such things as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; degrees or books sales seriously; I judge the final product, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for my money, the Lojban group has done about 10 times the valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work in linguistics than any modern Chomsky-worshipper I know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you have such animosity for Chomsky or researchers working in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; wake?  What, exactly, have Lojbanists actually done?  Made a (possibly)</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural language that computers can parse better than English or Finnish?</i><br>
<i>&gt; That says more about the limitations of contemporary computers compared</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the parsing (and, more importantly, interpretation) ability of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; human being. Lojban aims to minimize ambiguity.  Check.  English contains</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentences like "Time flies like an arrow," which can be parsed any of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of ways by a computer.  Check.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However if, in speech and not writing, I say to you "Hey, time flies like</i><br>
<i>&gt; an arrow," I sincerely doubt you'll take it as "'time-flies' enjoy a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular arrow" or any other bizarre sense.  Why?  Because intonation</i><br>
<i>&gt; plays a very important role in communicating meaning...</i><br>
<p>
I'll go even further than that: without intonation of any kind, any<br>
normal English reader would read that sentence as I just did, and parse<br>
it correctly.  The failure of a computer to do so does indeed say more<br>
about the limits of the computer than of the language.  But there are<br>
other cases where the needed specificity is actually /difficult/ to say<br>
in English without great effort, where it is much simpler in Lojban.<br>
Perhaps that is a small subset; but it is definitely non-empty.  And<br>
what is the evidence that intonation /must/ play a part in communicating<br>
meaning?  Are we not communicating now?  Wouldn't it be nice to use<br>
a language in which we could express the things usually done by<br>
intonation in text instead?<br>
<p>
My only argument with Chomsky is that he is treated as a God by much<br>
of the linguistics world.  Specifically, his dismissal of the Sapir-<br>
Whorf hypothesis is taken as if it had been discredited, when it fact<br>
nothing of the kind has taken place.  Many experiments have failed to<br>
show strong effects, and many /have/ show weaker effects--clearly<br>
showing, for example, that language can affect cognition even to the<br>
point of perception.  These phenomena go largely unexplored today<br>
because Chomsky followers don't think they'll amount to anything, and<br>
that is a great loss.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Phonology is a tricky area; we hear phonological distinctions that aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; there in the accoustics.  Until we can get a computer to make the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; context-sensitive distinctions and interpretations that any neurologically</i><br>
<i>&gt; and anatomically normal 5-year-old can, we don't know enough about speech</i><br>
<i>&gt; perception and production to try and alter the basics of language.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly my earlier point about the SWH: ask anyone here if they<br>
actually /hear/ word breaks in spoken English.  Most people will<br>
unquestioningly say "yes, of course".  You and I both know that<br>
those breaks don't exist in the acoustics, so their perception is<br>
being influenced by their learned language.  These effects deserve<br>
more study.  For example, would a child who grew up with Lojban<br>
phonetics "hear" word breaks where Lojban makes them optional<br>
(which is almost everywhere)?  Would two children who grew up<br>
speaking Lojban to each other over email, but with two different<br>
native languages, end up using the same intonations, or might they<br>
even use Lojban text in different ways?<br>
<p>
The existence of a language like Lojban makes it possible to<br>
study questions like this in a way that would really not be<br>
possible any other way.  Even if the language /as a language/<br>
is deeply flawed--and it may well be, though I haven't found<br>
so yet--it is still a great contribution to the science.<br>
