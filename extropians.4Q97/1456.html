In a message dated 97-11-16 02:54:00 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I'm aware that hemp has uses. :)<br>
 <br>
 And I think as an economic crop, hemp qua crop makes sense. Trying to get it<br>
 accepted is another matter, a propaganda matter.<br>
 <br>
 However, regarding hemp qua fuel: inasmuch as hemp still has to be<br>
cultivated,<br>
 there's an energy cost associated with that. Assuming hemp is as efficient<br>
as<br>
 soybeans at generating oil (that seems like a conservative estimate), and<br>
 assuming similar cultivation/processing costs (not sure this is true), a<br>
first<br>
 approximation of the energy credit (or debt) ought to be easily calculable.<br>
I<br>
 don't have the numbers at present. But we don't see a lot of soybean-powered<br>
 cars, do we? Now if hemp were incredibly better as a fuel, or incredibly<br>
cheaper<br>
 to cultivate, this use might still pan out. I'm curious to know if the book<br>
you<br>
 mention goes into this, or just handwaves about it.<br>
 <br>
 I'll try to look up that book. Have you got an ISDN number handy? Thanks.<br>

hi<br>
<p>
hmmm, I found an ISBN number for the book, perhaps that what you were talking<br>
about: <br>
<p>
ISBN: 1878125028  for the 1998 version not yet released (due out Jan 1), (he<br>
updates it like every 2 years) 1996 version is sold out and out of print<br>
<p>
amazon books sells v1998 discounted for $19.95 (list price $24.95)<br>
www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/3901-4729388-849311<br>
<p>
Im pretty sure the book has all the specifics and up-to-date scientific<br>
reports etc...<br>
