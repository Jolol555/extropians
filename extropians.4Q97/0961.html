Holger Wagner (Holger.Wagner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de) said:<br>
<i>&gt;I was wondering if anybody on this lists knows about *scientific*</i><br>
<i>&gt;approaches to some of the phenomena most people consider mystical.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Things like out-of-body-experiences, spontanuous recovery from</i><br>
<i>&gt;sicknesses, witchcraft and so on. </i><br>
<p>
There are groups like CSICOP and the Skeptics Society that sometimes<br>
attempt to present alternative non-paranormal explanations for phenomena<br>
considered mysterious. Unfortunately, these groups have chosen to only<br>
make a small portion of their magazines available on the web:<br>
<p>
CSICOP publishers of Skeptical Inquirer<br>
<a href="http://www.csicop.org/">http://www.csicop.org/</a><br>
<p>
Skeptic Society publishers of Skeptic Magazine<br>
<a href="http://www.skeptic.com/skeptics-society.html">http://www.skeptic.com/skeptics-society.html</a><br>
<p>
Another web resource with a "skeptical" viewpoint is:<br>
The Skeptic's Dictionary by Robert T. Carroll<br>
<a href="http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/">http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/</a><br>
<p>
The dictionary entry for Out-of-body experience (OBE) is brief:<br>
<a href="http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/obe.html">http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/obe.html</a><br>
<p>
It refers to books by Susan Blackmore and it also points to an essay by<br>
Keith Augustine: <br>

The Scientific Case Against Immortality<br>
by Keith Augustine<br>

Here is an excerpt about near-death experiences (NDEs) which are<br>
related to out-of-body experiences:<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
Some findings of NDE research are more consistent with physiological and<br>
psychological models. None of the patients who report NDEs are brain dead<br>
because brain death is irreversible (Beyerstein 46). First, NDEs only<br>
occur in one-third of all cases where there is a near-death crisis (Ring<br>
194). Second, the details of NDEs depend on the individual's personal and<br>
cultural background (Ring 195). Third, physiological and psychological<br>
factors affect the content of the NDE. Noises, tunnels, bright lights, and<br>
other beings are more common in physiological conditions directly<br>
affecting the brain state, such as cardiac arrest and anesthesia, whereas<br>
euphoria, mystical feelings, life review, and positive transformation can<br>
occur when people simply believe they are going to die (Blackmore, "Dying"<br>
44-45). Fourth, the core features of NDEs are found in drug-induced and<br>
naturally occurring hallucinations (Siegel 174). The OBE can be induced by<br>
the anesthetic ketamine (Blackmore, "Dying"  170). A tunnel experience is<br>
a common form of psychedelic hallucination (Siegel 175-6). All NDE stages<br>
have occurred in sequence under the influence of hashish (Blackmore,<br>
"Dying"  42-3). Fifth, a build-up of carbon dioxide in the brain will<br>
induce NDEs (Blackmore, "Dying" 53-4). Sixth, the panoramic life review<br>
closely resembles a form of temporal lobe epilepsy (206). There are even<br>
cases where epileptics have had OBEs or even seen apparitions of dead<br>
friends and relatives during their seizures (206). Seventh, computer<br>
simulations of random neural firing based on eye-brain mapping of the<br>
visual cortex have produced the tunnel and light characteristic of NDEs<br>
(84). Finally, NDEs can be induced by direct electrical stimulation of<br>
brain areas surrounding the Sylvian fissure in the right temporal lobe<br>
(Morse 104).<br>
