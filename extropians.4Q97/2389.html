And where exactly does this "source" come from?  It is coal dug up<br>
and transported in the same inefficient process or else oil or<br>
natural gas which are refined and transported in the same manner as<br>
the fuel used to power an IC engine (solar and RE sources being so<br>
small as to be completely insignificant in any such analysis.)<br>
Sounds like this back-end cost is a wash as far as efficiency<br>
calculations go, the electric power plant is more efficient than<br>
masses of individual engines but that is as far back as you can take<br>
the calculation.  Distribution costs for both forms are equally fuzzy<br>
(i.e. building and maintaining an electrical distribution network is<br>
expensive and costs energy, the same distribution network for<br>
gasoline is expensive but you had to build the roads in the first<br>
place for the cars which are the subject of this discussion...)<br>
