<i>&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that such travel would be impossible due</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the fact that wormholes tend to collapse as soon as they form.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Traditional" (Einstein-Rosen bridges) wormholes do collapse almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately, before anything can traverse them. But Thorne showed that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in principle it is possible to stabilize wormholes by threading them</i><br>
<i>&gt; with negative energy densities (for example from electric fields,</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative matter or the Casimir effect). Later papers have shown that</i><br>
<i>&gt; stable wormholes may be possible, but most involve violations of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy conditions (which say there are no negative energy densities;</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are however somewhat doubted) or dynamic wormholes that change</i><br>
<i>&gt; "radius" (some do this so slowly they are traversable).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;However, I was speaking with a friend a while back, and he brought up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the subject of Kerr (sp?) black holes. It seems that these are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;theoretical black holes in which the singularity is larger than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mathematical point, elongated perpendicular to an axis of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rotation. Some physicists seem to think that that this singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;may be ring-shaped. If so, this would mean that one could follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;axis of rotation into the very center, supposedly "passing through"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the singularity (which if I am not mistaken would have the properties</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of a wormhole/gravity well).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, the Kerr-Newman solution to the equations (which is a rotating,</i><br>
<i>&gt; charged hole) has many interesting properties, including a</i><br>
<i>&gt; ring-singularity inside the black hole and the possibility of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wormhole through it. Unfortunately there seems to be results that</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggests that natural black holes will not work, the wormhole</i><br>
<i>&gt; connection is broken when the hole is formed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If it were possible to begin a normal (Schwarzchild) black hole</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rotating, would one be able to create such a ring-shaped</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; singularity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe. Making a Schwartzschild hole rotate is simple, just throw in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass with angular momentum. But I'm not sure we can control where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "wormhole" leads, and it might be very hard to get out of the wormhole</i><br>
<i>&gt; opening if that is another black hole. I think I prefer classic</i><br>
<i>&gt; womholes...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Actually, conservation of momentum dictates that, if you can pass<br>
directly through the center (down through the pole as the hole rotates<br>
round you), you should be able to come out the other end, provided that<br>
the hole on the other end is of equal or less mass than the one you go<br>
into. Due to frictional losses, you would however, come out into a lower<br>
orbit on the other end. If anyone has any relativistic reasons why<br>
conservation of momentum would not hold, please explain...<br>
<p>
If you cn get the hole spinning fast enough, the event horizon should<br>
also warp into a toroidal shape at some point....<br>
