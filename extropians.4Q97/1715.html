You can send the $100 along to the Estate of the late Dr Gerald Feinberg,<br>
who did a lot of the early work on the hypothetical tachyon and many years<br>
proposed a Prometheus Foundation (IIRC) devoted to exploring long-range<br>
options for humanity; he wrote a nice book about it, probably out of print<br>
now.<br>
<p>
*Daedalus*, BTW, is the title of a long-established journal of science and<br>
the arts, as well as the pseudonym of a witty scientist who once had a<br>
weekly column in *New Scientist* and later moved, I think, to *Nature*.<br>
His ideas were not a million miles from the wild &amp; wacky stuff that appears<br>
on this list, although under his own name he famously lambasted Drexler's<br>
nanotech.  (Ref'd in Ed Regis's NANO! I think, but since the fiend hasn't<br>
included an index...)<br>
