Your pointing out that a concept in itself might be immoral<br>
introduces to me a new and very important dimension of thought.<br>
So far, I have classified certain concepts as invalid and<br>
fraudulent, but I hadn't made the connection with morality.<br>
<p>
So far, I've thought of only certain acts as immoral.  But,<br>
now that you've pointed it out, if a concept -- or thinking<br>
in terms of that concept -- almost always leads to immoral<br>
acts, or results in most people (those at the effect of<br>
political games) being disadvantaged by the unwitting<br>
acceptance of that concept as valid, then that concept<br>
should be regarded as immoral.<br>
<p>
I would write your first sentence exactly as you have.<br>
The second I would write: "I would never do anything for<br>
any supposed or pretended "country" because the notion<br>
that there are so-called "countries" is an illusion."<br>
(Of course, this depends on my audience.  I belong to<br>
a Toastmaster's Club.  Some of the members work for<br>
the "cop department."  To them I would say, "I love<br>
the country of my adoption!")<br>
<p>
By the way, the realization that the notion of "country"<br>
is illusory is a logical extrapolation from Max More's<br>
'Deep Anarchy' &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm</a>&gt;.<br>

Thank you!  You've just enriched the NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic<br>
Political Illusion Complex debate which starts on the<br>
Advanced Freedom Solutions List on Wednesday, 10/15/97.<br>
