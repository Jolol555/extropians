Actually, if you're using a rocket that's not true. You save a <br>
significant amount, both because you get above most of the air,<br>
which eats up a large fraction of a rocket's fuel in drag, and<br>
because you can use vacuum nozzles, which are several percent<br>
more economical than sea-level nozzles. This (lifting the rocket<br>
to 80,000 feet with zero velocity) was the approach that Kistler<br>
Aerospace planned to use for their first 'SSTO' before they <br>
switched to more traditional designs.<br>
<p>
However, the fact remains that you're at most 25% of the way to<br>
orbit. I have, though, read theoretical designs which launched<br>
the payload vertically to a couple of hundred kilometers, then<br>
'slowed it' into an orbiting space station using a mass-driver.<br>
Sadly, building such a station would probably be almost as hard<br>
as building a beanstalk, as the mass-driver had to be hundreds<br>
of kilometers in length.<br>
