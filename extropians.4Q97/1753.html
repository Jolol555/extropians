<i>&gt; &gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cosmological density doesn't come into the question directly, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;many scientists no doubt hope the missing mass sets omega=1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; even accounting for that leaves the amount of mass needed under current</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimates between one tenth and one hundredth that need to "close" the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe -- i.e., give it global positive curvature.  I've talked to a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; of mine who have backgrounds in the field, and they agree.  They believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the cosmologists who subscribe to positive curvature are far from</i><br>
<i>&gt; proving their case.  I suspect other motives at work -- such as intuition:</i><br>
<i>&gt; an open, infinite and everexpanding universe is not neat and simple like</i><br>
<i>&gt; a finite, closed one that bounces back and forth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
While I agree that current observations tend to suggest an open universe, I<br>
disagree that this is any less intuitively pleasing than a closed universe,<br>
and that this is why cosmologists search for missing mass. There are a<br>
multitude of other observed phenomena which align well with the theory of a<br>
closed universe, as well as theoretical reasons for believing that such a<br>
case is probable. An open universe is just as intuitively pleasing - if only<br>
to suggest that our notion of time is in some way accurate - that it does in<br>
fact have some degree of linearity.<br>
