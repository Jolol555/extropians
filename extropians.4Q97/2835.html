A holiday message from the Libertarian Futurist Society:<br>
<p>
Happy holidays, and thanks for reading this message, forwarded to you by Matt<br>
Gaylor. Matt has just joined the Libertarian Futurist Society because he<br>
supports individual freedom, enjoys reading science fiction and fantasy and<br>
wants to live in a free future. If you share Matt's interests and values, you<br>
might want to join us, too!<br>
<p>
Founded in 1982, the LFS sponsors the annual Prometheus Award and Prometheus<br>
Hall of Fame, publishes the quarterly "Prometheus," arranges a Prometheus<br>
awards ceremony at the annual Worldcon, debates libertarian futurist issues<br>
(such as private space exploration) and provides fun and fellowship for<br>
libertarian science fiction fans.<br>
<p>
Edited by Anders Monsen, the LFS's "Prometheus" newsletter contains more<br>
reviews of freedom-oriented science fiction and fantasy from a libertarian<br>
perspective than you can find anywhere else. Plus, our newsletter includes<br>
regular news updates about libertarian and individualist authors, interesting<br>
columns, reports on Worldcon events and occasional short fiction.<br>
<p>
Now is an exciting time to join us because the LFS is reorganizing to upgrade<br>
our programs, provide better services and offer more opportunities to get<br>
involved. For example, effective in 1998, we are recruiting volunteers for<br>
several new projects and committees, such as Worldcon outreach and organizing<br>
LFS parties at other cons.<br>
<p>
There's another good reason to join or subscribe now. For the first time in<br>
more than a decade, we are raising membership dues, effective Jan. 1, 1998.<br>
But if you join now, you can take advantage of cheaper rates: $15/yr. for<br>
Basic membership ($20/yr in 1998). Make your checks to LFS and mail them<br>
(postmarked in December for the cheaper rates) to LFS Offer, c/o Victoria<br>
Varga, 89 Gebhardt, Penfield NY 14526.<br>
<p>
Basic membership, which includes the newsletter, helps support the Prometheus<br>
awards, which have helped bring recognition to up-and-coming writers at<br>
crucial times in their career, and ensure a continuing libertarian voice and<br>
vision in science fiction.<br>
<p>
The LFS made history earlier this year when Victor Koman's "Kings of the High<br>
Frontier" was chosen the 1997 Prometheus Award winner. In a living embodiment<br>
of libertarian futurism, this is the first time that an electronic/Internet<br>
novel has won a major award. Past Prometheus winners include L. Neil Smith<br>
("The Probability Broach," "Pallas"), James Hogan ("Voyage From Yesteryear,"<br>
"The Multiplex Man"), F. Paul Wilson ("Wheels Within Wheels"), Vernor Vinge<br>
("Marooned in Real Time") Victor Koman ("The Jehovah Contract," "Soloman's<br>
Knife"), J. Neil Schulman ("The Rainbow Cadenza"), Michael Flynn ("In the<br>
Country of the Blind"), Brad Linaweaver ("Moon of Ice") and Ken MacLeod ("The<br>
Star Fraction").<br>
<p>
As a Basic member, you will have the right to nominate current novels for the<br>
Prometheus Award and older classics for the Hall of Fame. Basic members also<br>
vote for the annual Hall of Fame winner. Past winners include Robert<br>
Heinlein's "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"<br>
George Orwell's "1984," Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," Ursula LeGuin's "The<br>
Dispossessed," Poul Anderson's "Trader to the Stars," Alfred Bester's "The<br>
Stars My Destination," Eric Frank Russell's "The Great Explosion," C.M.<br>
Kornbluth's "The Syndic," F. Paul Wilson's "An Enemy of the State" and Robert<br>
Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's hilarious "Illuminatus" trilogy.<br>
<p>
If any of these novels happen to be among your personal favorites, you really<br>
should join us or subscribe! If you're not ready to join just yet, you can<br>
find out more about us by subscribing to Prometheus. If you subscribe now,<br>
you pay only $12 for four issues ($15/year in '98.) Overseas (airmail): Add<br>
$5.<br>
    Sample back issues: $3, 2 for $5 or 3/$6.<br>
<p>
More information about the LFS, including a complete list of past<br>
award winners, is available at<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.libertarian.com/LFS/">http://www.libertarian.com/LFS/</a><br>
<p>
but contact Varga directly to join.<br>
<p>
With your support, the Libertarian Futurist Society can make further strides<br>
toward a free future and continue to give outstanding writers the recognition<br>
they deserve.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Michael Grossberg, LFS co-founder (mikegrossb@aol.com)<br>
Victoria Varga, LFS director (vvarga@compuserve.com)<br>
Anders Monsen, Prometheus editor<br>
<p>
P.S. If you have read a 1997 novel that may be worthy of the Prometheus<br>
award, we'd like to know about it. Although only LFS members may officially<br>
nominate novels for our awards, we'd be happy to check out your suggestions.<br>
Just email Michael Grossberg (mikegrossb@aol.com), chairman of the Prometheus<br>
Finalists (Judges) Committee, by mid-January. (And keep him posted if you<br>
read worthy 1998 novels.)<br>
