After trying to think what parts of the arguments to quote, I gave up<br>
and elided all of them, since they distract from my main question:<br>
<p>
What difference does it make to my day-to-day existence whether or not<br>
aliens made crop circles?  If they did, should I invest my money<br>
differently?  Make a pilgrimage?  Vote Republican?  If they didn't,<br>
should I fund a lawsuit?  Buy real estate?  Vote Republican?<br>
<p>
People think, claim, prove, denounce, and preach all kinds of things, and<br>
their opposites.  I let them, unless it makes a difference in my life.<br>
Conspiracies and coverups exist.  So do charlatans and schizotypics.  I<br>
don't have time to try to get rid of, denounce, or even complain about,<br>
any or all of those.<br>
<p>
What better things could you be doing with *your* time?<br>
