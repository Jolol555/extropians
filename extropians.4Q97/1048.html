Here are 2 quotes from essay called "Primitives and Extropians", <br>
found at    <a href="http://www.elnet.com/~lrobin/frames/bey/primitiv.htm">http://www.elnet.com/~lrobin/frames/bey/primitiv.htm</a><br>
by Hakim Bey, author of The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ).<br>
<p>
"reprinted from Anarchy: a journal of desire armed #42, Fall 1995."<br>
<p>
Even when Bey paints us as an extended Jetsons family falling into<br>
Cogswellian traps, I like how he paints.  Anyway, the quotes:<br>
<p>
    By contrast, the anarcho-extropian or futurians are also forced to <br>
    reify the eschaton--since the present is obviously not the utopia of <br>
    techne' they envision--by placing perfection in a future where <br>
    symbolic mediation has abolished hierarchy, rather than in a past <br>
    where such mediation has not yet appeared (the ideal Palaeolithic of <br>
    the primitivists). Obviously for the extropians, mediation per se <br>
    cannot be defined as "impurity" or as the invariable source of<br>
    separation, alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains <br>
    obvious that such separation does in fact occur, that it amounts to <br>
    immiseration, that not all technology is "liberating" according to <br>
    any anarchist definition of the term, and that some of it is <br>
    downright oppressive. The extropian therefore lacks and needs a<br>
    critique of technology, and of the incredibly complex relation <br>
    between the social and the technical. ...<br>
<p>
    ...<br>
<p>
    I must admit that my own taste inclines neither toward Wilderness <br>
    World nor Spaceship Earth as exclusive categories. I actually spend <br>
    far more time defending wildness than "civilization," because it is <br>
    far more threatened. I yearn for the reappearance of Nature out of <br>
    Culture--but not for the eradication of all symbolic mediation. The <br>
    word "choice" has been so devalued lately. Let's say I'd prefer a <br>
    world of indeterminacy, of rich ambiguity, of complex impurities. My<br>
    critics, apparently, do not. I find much to admire and desire in <br>
    both their models, but can't for even a moment believe in them as <br>
    totalities. Their future or eschatology bores me, unless I can mix <br>
    it into the stew of the TAZ--or use it to magic the TAZ into active <br>
    existence--to tease the TAZ into action. The TAZ is "broad-minded" <br>
    enough to entertain more than two, or even six, impossible ideas<br>
    "before breakfast." ...<br>
