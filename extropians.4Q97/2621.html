We are not in the wild.  We are in civilization.  Humans do not have to<br>
kill and be killed all the time.  If we made guns go away, as you dream<br>
about, we could have many fun predators to deal with again.<br>

It's not whether I have a tank or a sword.  It's what I have relative to<br>
the other guy.  If I have a tank, and he has a tank, I'll have third and<br>
fourth thoughts about going to war.  If I have a sword, and he has<br>
nothing, then he does what I want or dies.<br>
<p>
History before guns: chronic warfare.<br>
History when machine guns had just been invented, and weren't fully<br>
appreciated: World War I.<br>
History when machines guns and jets were appreciated but most of Europe<br>
thought pacifism and light armament could work, but Germany had lots of<br>
guns: World War II.<br>
History with nuclear weapons on both sides: peace.  Or perhaps a<br>
frightened lack of hostilities, but still: how many Americans and<br>
Russians have died in conflict with each other?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; trying to look at it as a hypothetical situation, where in no guns had ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; existed.  Don't you think crime related deaths would be a lot lower?</i><br>
 <br>
No.<br>
<p>
And you say attitudes have changed.  Yes, partly because of guns and other<br>
advanced technology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; game.  It makes boys and men equal.  If gangs were based on brute strength and</i><br>
<i>&gt; regular old street fighting, and members didn't have a gun to protect them, do you</i><br>
<p>
Guns to protect them?  What the hell protects me?  Your historical<br>
warrior is young, strong, and practiced in combat.  I'm weak and<br>
unskilled.  They rule.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; active destruction, it's still destruction.  I'd don't think you see what I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting at.  How bout no destruction at all?  Guns are easy, guns are democratic.</i><br>
<p>
How bout free energy?  There is no "no destruction".  Any tool can be a<br>
weapon, if you know how to use it.  Weapons are simply tools with no<br>
other purpose than to kill.  Which means anyone can use them.  As<br>
opposed to an elite.<br>
<p>
Power exists.  You can't get rid of it.  You can, however, spread it<br>
around so that it balances and cancels.<br>
