<p>
Delmar, way back in the first issue of Extropy magazine (in1988) I wrote an<br>
article called "Morality or Reality" in which I took a position like yours.<br>
While I still agree with much of what I wrote there -- especially about the<br>
way in which what most people call "morality" is ungrounded and<br>
anti-individual -- I no longer find it an adequate view. I agree completely<br>
with you whenever morals are founded on a higher authority, whether a<br>
mythical god, an earthly leader, faith, or a false philosophical idea (such<br>
as found in Kant). <br>
<p>
However, when I now talk of "rational values" (not "objective morality") I<br>
mean values that are internally self-consistent and which are carefully<br>
reasoned out based on certain deep desires and goals that I believe most<br>
people share. If someone, after careful thought, genuinely does not share<br>
basic values of survival and flourishing, then I cannot argue with them.<br>
The basis of our ethics fundamentally differs. In that sense, morality is<br>
not objective or universal. Since I think that almost everyone, if they<br>
dumped their religious beliefs, would come to broadly similar ethical<br>
conclusions, I do think that ethics can be rational. <br>
<p>
[Another way to put this, fanciful but helpful: If there really were<br>
vampires, and there survival really did depend on drinking the blood of<br>
humans (in such a way that it killed them and there were no alternatives<br>
like blood banks) then it would be *right* for vampires to attack humans.<br>
It would also be *right* for humans to defend themselves. Differences in<br>
nature produce different behaviors that are good for the beings that do<br>
them. Given that humans have essentially the same nature, such moral<br>
divergence is unlikely. If our AI's emerge as radically different from us<br>
in terms of basic motivations, then some of their rational morality may be<br>
quite different from ours.]<br>
<p>
This is not to say that ALL values can be rationally supported in terms of<br>
more fundamental values and goals. Many higher-level (more derived) values<br>
will be context-dependent, and others (matters of taste) will be arbitrary.<br>
I suspect that even those who have divergent fundamental values may be<br>
potentially open to argument, since I'm not certain that any values are<br>
truly fundamental. They may simply be values that are most securely<br>
embodied in a network of values (rather than foundational building blocks<br>
supporting everything else).<br>
<p>
If you wish to continue seeing ALL possible approaches to morality as<br>
anti-individualistic, I think you need to explain why this approach fits<br>
your characterization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose, however, that I am not mistaken; that the concept, morality, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually a support of anti individual oppression, would not exposing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;myth of morality go a long way toward the promotion of individualism?  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;individualism your preference? If so, how do you propose to promote the</i><br>
<i>&gt;idea? "Moral argument?" If so, your choice, but when I observe, The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crusades, The Inquisitions, Jonestown, Waco, world wars, on and on and on as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"resolution" of "moral arguments", I'm inclined to take a different approach.</i><br>
<p>
All of those episodes were drived by religiously derived morality. It is<br>
fallacious to condemn all morals on the basis of morals founded on<br>
religion. What about utilitarianism? Though I am not and never have been a<br>
utilitarian, I see that it has NOT led to the nasty kinds of event you<br>
mention. In fact, it has historically been associated with things like<br>
liberation of women, opposition to pointless harsh retributive punishment,<br>
and increased political freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;irrelevant to everyday use.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then so is individualism and freedom. </i><br>
<p>
I don't believe I said that morality was irrelevant to everyday use.<br>
Arguing about what things are ethical *can* produce results, though<br>
generally mostly with people who are educationed, informed, and reasonably<br>
rational. What I *did* say, is that we can probably produce more results by<br>
encouraging generally rationality than by arguing for particular moral views.<br>
