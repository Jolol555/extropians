I don't remember the authors, but the one psych course I took included<br>
reading two books regarding the Oedipus Complex in the Samoan Society.<br>
The first, earlier book had claimed that because Samoan society was<br>
matriarchal, in which the father left the family and was not as<br>
important as the Mother's brother to the family, that Samoans did not<br>
have an oedipal complex. The later work debunked the conclusions of the<br>
first, showing that, by its mythic structure, there was an oedipal<br>
complex, that was possibly more severe and violent than that in a<br>
patriarchal society, but tended to be repressed by the individual. THe<br>
title of the second book was "Oedipus in the Trobriands". Apparently the<br>
first book had been widely touted by feminists here in the US as proof<br>
that patriarchal society as we had was bad for child development and<br>
family harmony.<br>
