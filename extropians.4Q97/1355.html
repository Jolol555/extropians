I didn't get beyond this point without a mental "huh?".  Immigration, sure,<br>
but illegal?  A quick altavista search led to:<br>

<p>
an article about the 1996 immigration bill:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the Senate rejected an important legal immigration provision when</i><br>
<i>&gt; it buried efforts led by Simpson to cut the number of legal immigrants</i><br>
<i>&gt; permitted to enter the country, now about 750,000 a year.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; The centerpiece of the Senate bill aims to curb the flow of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimated 300,000 foreigners who enter the United States illegally or</i><br>
<i>&gt; overstay their visas each year, and to make it more difficult for</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who do come here illegally to obtain jobs and government</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that</i><br>
<i>&gt; four million illegal immigrants now live in the United States.</i><br>
<p>
The article appears to have no axe to grind, and from this it appears that<br>
at least in the United States, legal immigration is much more important<br>
than illegal immigration.  I would expect the imbalance in favor of legal<br>
immigration to be even larger in European countries, which don't have<br>
the U.S. situation of a long border with Mexico.<br>
<p>
It is misleading to say that the rich countries are growing because<br>
of illegal immigration, when legal immigration plays a significantly<br>
larger role.<br>
