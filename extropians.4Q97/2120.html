Assuming that a dual-list structure can be maintained without  <br>
an inordinate drain on ExI's resources, I support the concept from <br>
a memetic standpoint.  Very few discussion forums currently exist for <br>
persons new to transhumanist and extropian thought to participate in<br>
intelligent, rational discussion and, in doing so, to develop their <br>
own potential for future contributions.  None of us came to this set <br>
of ideas full-blown, and many of us have experienced growth through <br>
interaction with more advanced thinkers.  Some general transhumanists <br>
make the decision to pursue extropian goals, and others sharpen our <br>
minds with their continued presence.<br>

Sin,<br>
