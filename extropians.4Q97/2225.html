<i>&gt; From:          Arjen Kamphuis &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know. Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same. Someone on the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead</i><br>
<i>&gt; but can't tell whether it's something solid or just a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt; thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever...) and the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not going to slow down because some backseater 'thinks' he sees</i><br>
<i>&gt; something. So here we are rushing toward an object that could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall of concrete. After some</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion the still unclear object is now to close for a full stop,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what happens' or the ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is' at the lowest speed</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize the damage (if any).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Really bad analogy.<br>
<p>
A better analogy:<br>
<p>
You're driving along a road through low hills.  It's a rather twisty <br>
road and you can't see all that far ahead, but you're driving at a <br>
reasonable speed.  One of the back seat passengers thinks he sees a <br>
fog bank up ahead, and says that he vaguely remembers the road <br>
turning abruptly downhill somewhere along here.  Another back seat <br>
passenger says he saw no fog bank, and remembers the first backseater <br>
claiming a few days before that the road turns abruptly UPhill.  A <br>
third backseater (it's a big vehicle) says that if we go any higher <br>
we'll run out of oxygen, and a fourth points at the lambs gamboling <br>
at the top of a nearby hill and claims the oxygen problem ain't so.  <br>
Meanwhile the first backseater claims we're near sea level and so <br>
going down could be bad, and the fourth guy notices that off in the <br>
distance (through a conveniently timed gap) it appears we can see a <br>
lot further down and there's no sign of an ocean.<br>
<p>
And in response to this confusion, some want us to come to a dead <br>
halt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An international panel of scientists have some pretty good theories</i><br>
<i>&gt; that something will happen to the global climate</i><br>
<p>
The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global <br>
warming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; due to the usage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fossile fuels</i><br>
<p>
Actually, if the ice-age theorists (who were the panick mongering <br>
government-must-intervene-to-save-us crowd when I was in high school) <br>
are right, then the usage of fossil fuels might be why we AREN'T <br>
having problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (the only countries that don't agree with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; IPCC-reports are a few OPEC-members). Increased downward infrared</i><br>
<i>&gt; flux trough increased CO2 concentration is a well-accepted fact (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe a way to terraform Mars someday). The precise effects on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; global climate system cannot be estimated at this point, it may take</i><br>
<i>&gt; another 10 to 15 years to find conclusive evidence for (or against)</i><br>
<i>&gt; a human-induced climatechange.</i><br>
<p>
There is no need to wait for this evidence at all.  We can state <br>
categorically that previous eras when the temperature was rather <br>
higher than it is today were clearly NOT caused by human technology <br>
(being as they occurred variously before the dawn of man, up to as <br>
late as about the time humans started trying to domesticate fire).  <br>
We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT <br>
environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That <br>
while there have been fluctuation in shorelines all over the place <br>
all the time, there is no compelling evidence that any particular <br>
fluctuation was due to temperature variations in the range the <br>
global-warming-doomsday theorists are predicting.  (The <br>
ice-age-doomsday theorists, score rather differently on this point.)<br>
<p>
We can further state with confidence that human action did not make <br>
all that much difference in the CO2 content of the atmosphere over <br>
this century -- and the times it WOULD have made what difference it <br>
DID make, don't match up with the times of temperature changes or CO2 <br>
level changes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But: if nothing is done before then</i><br>
<i>&gt; it may very well be too late do to anything.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Given the fact that we have a resonable indication that something is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to happen that _may_ be very damaging to to the only habitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; planet we have it does not seem unreasonable to try to do something</i><br>
<p>
But what?  The choices are, with no particular reason to believe one <br>
over another:<br>
<p>
(a) an ice age is coming, we need to increase the greenhouse effect<br>
<p>
(b) we're increasing the greenhouse effect and threatening to cook <br>
our planet, we need to reduce the greenhouse effect<br>
<p>
(c) neither of these is happening, there's no big deal<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (IMHO).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe we could somehow include the cost of bonding the CO2 again (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; reforrestation) in the price of gasoline or electricity, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative for complex regulation. That way anybody can drive (&amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; fly) as much as he/she want as long as the true global cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'closed-cycle' consumption is paid. The funds could be used (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; oilcompanies?) to plant trees that will bond atmospheric carbon or</i><br>
<i>&gt; put into energy research.</i><br>
<p>
Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may be <br>
that you are wrong about the solution.  The fundamental need is to <br>
increase the amount of organic matter.  If your solution compels poor <br>
people on marginal land to continue the agricultural practices now <br>
turning that marginal land into desert, you are being <br>
counter-productive.<br>
<p>
For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what Clinton <br>
proposes US businesses should pay out of their own pockets each year <br>
to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to dumping dusts of <br>
metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern oceans, we might <br>
solve the problem not only for the US, but for the entire world.<br>
<p>
That is, still, assuming for the sake of argument that the <br>
global-warming doomsayers are right in their predictions.  What if <br>
the ice-age doomsayers are right?<br>
