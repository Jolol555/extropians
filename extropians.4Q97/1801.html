<i>&gt; &gt; Your vision sounds nice, but can it be guaranteed? We live in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world where things do go wrong, where unexpected things happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; despite precautions and where not everything is done with positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consequences in mind. Our development is linked with dangers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the future tends to turn out vastly different than our predictions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	True, but just because some religious people reject technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; all together and are surpassed and made insignificant by the rest of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technological world, doesn't mean they loose their right to exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; or to need!</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. I don't think there are any extropians (if there are, they<br>
should think about the principles a bit closer) that think eradicating<br>
the "pesky mehums" is a good thing. But not every posthuman will be a<br>
saint, and a slight error in judgement of a transcendent superbeing<br>
could destroy the remaining humans ("Oops... my cleaning nanites have<br>
just cleaned away the entire biosphere. What a mess. Let's hope nobody<br>
notices..."), not to mention Eugene's scenario of the posthumans one<br>
day deciding that carbon based life is so trivial and simple that<br>
there is no need to preserve it outside virtual reality (or at all). <br>
<p>
What I want is to find ways of ensuring human survival even in the<br>
very long run, even if the ethics of our descendants changes. The<br>
problem isn't the religious nuts, the problem is the big uncertainty<br>
about the future.<br>
