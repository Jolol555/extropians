This is old news, but a Forbes article from Sept 8, 1997 reports that<br>
Harry Browne has discontinued his investment newsletter:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/97/0908/6005229a.htm">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/97/0908/6005229a.htm</a><br>
<p>
We have occasionally discussed Browne here.  For a number of years he has<br>
advocated a cautious, diversified investment strategy designed to preserve<br>
assets while providing modest growth, regardless of the economic climate.<br>
Readers have finally lost patience with his message after so many years<br>
of steady successes in the stock market.<br>
<p>
The article makes some good points about the difficulty of keeping a level<br>
head in a declining market.  Many investors today have never experienced<br>
a true, long-term bear market, and it remains to be seen how they will<br>
handle it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a contrarian perspective, the fact that Browne's fortunes have finally</i><br>
fallen so low must be taken as another indicator that the market is near<br>
its peak.<br>
<p>
