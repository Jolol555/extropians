There is an article containing criticisms of the Canadian health care<br>
system and other national health care systems at the Cato Institute web<br>
site. Unfortunately, it is from 1992 and thus the illustrative examples<br>
given are rather dated. Yet, when viewed generically the criticisms<br>
presented accurately reflect some prototypical libertarian complaints:<br>
<p>
(I am not a libertarian but I think this is the kind of material you were<br>
requesting.) <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa184.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa184.html</a> <br>
<p>
The one common characteristic of all national health care systems is a<br>
shortage of services.  For example, in Great Britain, a country with a<br>
population of only 55 million, more than 800,000 patients are waiting for<br>
surgery.(4)  In New Zealand, a country with a population of just 3<br>
million, the surgery waiting list now exceeds 50,000.(5)  In Sweden the<br>
wait for heart x-rays is more than 11 months.  Heart surgery can take an<br>
additional 8 months.(6)  In Canada the wait for hip replacement surgery is<br>
nearly 10 months; for a mammogram, 2.5 months; for a pap smear, 5<br>
months.(7)  Surgeons in Canada report that, for heart patients, the danger<br>
of dying on the waiting list now exceeds the danger of dying on the<br>
operating table.(8)  According to Alice Baumgart, president of the<br>
Canadian Nurses Association, emergency rooms are so overcrowded that<br>
patients awaiting treatment frequently line the corridors.(9) <br>
<p>
&lt;skip&gt;<br>
<p>
Sometimes the rationing of care is even more explicit:  care is denied the<br>
elderly or patients whose prognosis is poor.  In Britain kidney dialysis<br>
is generally denied patients over the age of 55.  At least 1,500 Britons<br>
die each year because of lack of dialysis.(10) <br>
<p>
Countries with national health care systems also lag far behind the United<br>
States in the availability of modern medical technology.  It is well<br>
documented that in Canada, high-technology medicine is so rare as to be<br>
virtually un- available.(11)  That comparison holds for other countries as<br>
well.  Advanced medical technology is far more available in the United<br>
States than in any other nation.(12) <br>
<p>
(Footnote 11) For example, Canada has only 12 magnetic resonance imaging<br>
units, compared to more than 900 in the United States.  There are 2.5<br>
times as many CAT scanners in Seattle as in the entire province of British<br>
Columbia.  Canada has only 11 open-heart surgery centers, compared to 783<br>
in the United States.  The United States has six times as many lithotripsy<br>
units as Canada.  United States vs. Canadian Health Care: An Information<br>
Package (Washington: National Committee for Quality Health Care, March<br>
1990). <br>
