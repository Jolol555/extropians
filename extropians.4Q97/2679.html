plus the fact that<br>

<p>
Why no, it's quite easy.  Any replicator evolves to be the best possible<br>
replicator it can.<br>
It's been shown over and over again that a virus will evolve to spread as best<br>
it can;<br>
viruses that are benign to their host evolve to become more virulent if that<br>
aids their replication<br>
(HIV); viruses that are lethal evolve to become benign if *that* aids their<br>
replications<br>
(rabbit myxomatosis).  Effects on the host are just means, not ends.<br>
<p>
This applies to any replicator.  Over time, the replicators that replicate<br>
better will replace<br>
those that don't.  There is no way to hold a mutating replicator to any<br>
purpose other than<br>
replication.  People, memes, or viruses; it's all the same.<br>
