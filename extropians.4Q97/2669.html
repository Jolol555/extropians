<i>&gt;         Viruses have no "purpose." They exist to replicate, period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whatever they do to the host is either a side effect or used as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; replicative advantage. (You sneeze, friend gets sick)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    Things evolve for a purpose.  If you look at any living thing you can clearly see that.<br>
Perhaps they did come to be just to replicate, but I think the idea that they came about as a<br>
natural means of controling population is just as feasable.  Think about what happens to<br>
animals in a certain area when there is an outbreak of disease.  Animals will die, and when<br>
all the animals are dead, the virus will die out too. (once the population is contained, no<br>
more need for the virus, it goes bye bye, until more animals come along, plus the fact that<br>
since animals spread disease, the more animals there are, the easier it is for a virus to be<br>
transfered, the lower the population, the harder) But yes there's no real way to prove<br>
sucessfuly prove if what I'm saying or if what you're saying is true or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; We keep finding cures and more lethal and complex diseases arrive.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sign maybe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         A sign of evolution, yes.  A sign of some higher "balance and</i><br>
<i>&gt; harmony of nature" that you keep eluding to, probably not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
   Again the same thing.  When animals ruled the earth so to speak, populations were usually<br>
kept in balance with nature and the natural surroundings by how much life could be supported.<br>
With no real need for viruses and disease, and there weren't as many complex forms of it.  Now<br>
here we are, evolving and in the process discovering ways to combat the effects of disease, so<br>
in turn the disease has evolved too.  Again can't be proven I know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; thought it was an interesting point to touch upon.  Ever notice it's universally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accepted that basically man was meant to conquer the earth, and that the earth was</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                   ^^^^^</i><br>
<i>&gt;         ... Not on the Extropians mailing list, it's not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    Well then what do you think we're trying to do when we continue to progress and make<br>
technological, evolutionary, agricultural, etc., advancments?  Trying to replenish the worlds<br>
natural resources?  Trying to make the world a place where animals, people, and plants can<br>
live together in a natural state?  Trying to expand the mind, yes.  And it seems, correct me<br>
if I'm wrong, that these advancments we make on a whole, seem to entail trying to reach a<br>
perfect system of living, a utopia, where through the wonders of technology there is no more<br>
pain, suffering etc.  But without an overly strong concern for animals and the earth, not to<br>
say that there isn't a concern there, because there is.  Who knows maybe we'll reach that<br>
state of living, and everything will be in perfect balance, and woo hoo for us.  But at the<br>
rate we're going I just think it's questionable that we'll make it, and that all different<br>
perspectives should be considered, which is basically why I try to make the arguments that I<br>
make, I don't think that anything should be overlooked.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; why.  There are laws to life and balances.  If we don't abide by them, something's bound</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to happen.  We keep progressing, and searching for new technology, but to what end? And</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Please 1) List some or all of these "laws to life" (as I am sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Santa Fe Institute would love to know them) and 2) the basis for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; belief in them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    It's apperent in nature.  If you study wild animals and the way they live, study<br>
ecosystems, there are certain "laws" to life that have been set forth by nature.  The food<br>
chain, balance of predators and prey, etc.  What happens when you upset one of these balances,<br>
and so called "laws"?  Hmm well let's see.  Take predators and prey for example.  Wipe out all<br>
the predators in within an ecosystem and the prey will flourish, soon there won't be enough of<br>
a food source to sustain the out of control population, starvation will set in, and they will<br>
begin to die off.  If you kill of all the prey, that's fairly easy, there won't be enough of a<br>
food supply to support the predators.  I'm not going to go into everything obviously, but<br>
that's what I mean by "laws of nature".  Pick up a copy of the book, Ishmael, sometime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; for them.  They are content, they take what they need, and give back.  They follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; balance.  Now if they can survive in peace with nature for that long, it's damn amazing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; feat.  And when we come and wipe them out with our guns, to take their land and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resources for our expanding population it's actually quite sickening.  That system of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; living, all that knowledge, down the drain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Though your rant reeks of the "Beautiful People Myth," I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention much about that, as I am only vaguely familiar with it, but enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; to avoid believing in it.</i><br>
<p>
    Pick up the book Mutant Message Down Under by Marlo Morgan sometime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         Next, their survival is not an "amazing feat." Those cultures that</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't sustain themselves died out.  Natural selection filtered out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest, and we're left with those that work... a few primitive cultures, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot of more advanced ones.  Personally, I'd rather be in the latter</i><br>
<i>&gt; category when it comes to matters of healthcare.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
    I'm not speaking of the ones that have died out, I'm speaking of the ones that continued<br>
to survive, and all without threatening the integrity of the earth, and that we have managed<br>
to erase from the face of the planet.  The ones that would continue to survive and have<br>
continued to do so, if we didn't get involved.  They have been filtered out by us yes, and we<br>
automatically assume our way of life is far superior.  What I'm saying is, is it really?  It's<br>
all we know.  Personally I think our way of life is amazing yes, and it allows us to sustain<br>
ourselves very well, and make amazing discoveries and accomplishments.  But its also a very<br>
arrogant way of life that doesn't respect our surroundings overly, and has amounted with our<br>
ability to become our own undoing if we're not careful.  I think we need to make sure we<br>
consider all sides to avoid such a thing from happening.<br>
