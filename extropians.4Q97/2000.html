I may be a little premature in saying this (since you haven't given your<br>
"hows and whys"), but I think this decision may turn some good people off<br>
extropy.  Having to pay to join an institute to participate on a<br>
discussion has a culty feel to it, even if the justification is to reduce<br>
the signal-to-noise ratio.  Also, I don't think being a member of the<br>
extropy institute implies you make less "noise."  Some people may join the<br>
extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.<br>
Others, who would contribute a lot to the list, may not be interested in<br>
joining the extropy institute, either for monetary reasons or because they<br>
do not want to incur the wrath of those who would take out their petty<br>
frustrations on the members of the extropian movement.(ie. misguided<br>
neo-luddites) <br>
<p>
One restriction I would like to see is allowing only list-members to post.<br>
Restrictions beyond this may reduce the S/NR, but I don't think the<br>
reduction noise will be worth the loss of perfectly good signals! ;)<br>
