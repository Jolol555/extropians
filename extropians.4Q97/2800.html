<i>&gt;  &gt; I had the privilege to attend a special premiere of "The Postman" last</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; night because the author of the book it's based on, David Brin, is a San</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Diego resident, and agreed to a book signing and the premiere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I really liked the movie, and I think everyone should see it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; If you haven't read the book, you have less than a week before the movie</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; is released to theatres. Although the story line of the movie departs</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; dramatically from the book, the screenwriter managed to capture the vital</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; essence of the book -- something really rare from Hollyweird these days.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The story does revolve around a cautionary vision of survivalist militia</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; run amok -- might makes right, or the rejection of all that makes for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; civilized society. If anything though, the movie portrays the use of guns</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; in self-defense in stronger scenes than the book. Some things ARE worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; dying for - Hope, for example, and love.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The book was written back when stories of Survivalists stashing away arms</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and food caches in the forests were rampant. The screenplay is updated,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and I give them credit for not ONCE mentioning the word "MILITIA".</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Thumbs up.</i><br>

I first read "The Postman" back around 1987, and really enjoyed it. It<br>
has themes of both liberal and conservative stripes. THe liberal in that<br>
we should never let hate become a force in our internal politics,<br>
conservative in that if the Federal Government stuck to just delivering<br>
the mail and defending against foreign invaders, I bet a lot more people<br>
would be happier with it.<br>
