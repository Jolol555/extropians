<p>
My question to this would be:  Why, then, would our<br>
minds work to this -- i.e., to put things into causal<br>
stories?  (I'm using "causal stories" here to show<br>
the link more directly between stories and causality.<br>
Are there acausal stories?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, this "sparks [of concepts] striking up against</i><br>

<i>&gt;blending, and integrating at the level above this</i><br>
<i>&gt;where we interpret and apply the allegories,</i><br>
<i>&gt;metaphors and parables doesn't sound all that causal</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me.</i><br>
<p>
I admit they are not causal in the strict linear form most<br>
would associate with causality.  I would hasten to add<br>
that, though I don't want to make the idea of causality<br>
so broad as to defy any attempt at criticism, I generally<br>
accept the neoAristotelean/Objectivist view of causality<br>
-- which is of it as identity applied to change.  In other<br>
words, things act according to their nature.  This view<br>
need not rule out emergent behavior and the like.<br>
<p>
However, I see what you mean and admit causality<br>
and the sort of thing Mark Turner's THE LITERARY<br>
MIND seems to be about overlap to a large extent,<br>
but are not identical.  I still believe a lot of his view<br>
-- from the scraps quoted here and elsewhere -- can<br>
be subsumed under causality.  Saying that, of course,<br>
should not be taken to mean one to close all inquiry<br>
and merely mummble "Ah, causality!"  Just as<br>
biological processes are fundamentally physico-<br>
chemical ones, this does not mean they shouldn't<br>
be seen as a special type of process, almost in a<br>
class by themselves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me to be saying that human thought is</i><br>
<i>&gt;based principally on pattern matching,</i><br>
<p>
I would say that consciousness is basically pattern<br>
matching.  Human thought is only one type of<br>
consciousness.  This seems to happen on all levels<br>
of consciousness.  Even automatic things, such as<br>
my eyes imaging my bathrobe, are examples of<br>
pattern matching.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;an on-going</i><br>
<i>&gt;variation and selection, feedback between many</i><br>
<i>&gt;levels, where it is effectively impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;untangle all the causal threads.</i><br>
<p>
The statement here implies that there are causal<br>
threads -- i.e., that causality is operative!:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We may frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt;jump to causal conclusions about events happening in</i><br>
<i>&gt;our environment that work for practical purposes even</i><br>
<i>&gt;though the causality really isn't there.</i><br>
<p>
This is only to say that the mind is fallible.  This sort of<br>
thing would cut against any theory of mind, though.  To<br>
say, we sometimes get things wrong does not explain<br>
why or why we often get things right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, I haven't actually had a chance to read</i><br>
<i>&gt;Turner's book, though I'd like to.</i><br>
<p>
I too, though I've enough books now that I should read<br>
that I will need to get my life extended just for that!<br>

<i>&gt;temporal order.  We humanize them by assigning</i><br>
<i>&gt;'cause'.</i><br>
<p>
This is the usual starting point for all who attack<br>
causality.  The thing is not that we "humanize them<br>
by assigning 'cause'" BUT that we assign causes<br>
at all.  To say we do something in such a way is not<br>
a refutation of it.  Nor is it a proof that it has nothing<br>
to do with reality.  Instead, it might actually the way<br>
minds have to understand reality BECAUSE there<br>
are causes -- even given that we might never<br>
know all of them or be mistaken about quite a few.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"I think I know how it is that we do this,</i><br>
<i>&gt;through the neural processes of corollary discharge</i><br>
<i>&gt;and reafference.  If this is valid, then causation</i><br>
<i>&gt;holds in human actions, but it is misassigned to</i><br>
<i>&gt;phenomena in the world, leading to the quandary</i><br>
<i>&gt;described above."</i><br>
<p>
I disagree, and note how he has assigned a cause<br>
here!  He implies "neural processes" are the cause<br>
of the way we "humanize" the "interrelations of<br>
objects and events.":)  As usual, those who deny<br>
axioms must use the very axioms in the denial.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Chris Malcolm [snip] went on to describe how:</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Cause is relative to the capabilities and purposes</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the observer. Cause is an observer-related</i><br>
<i>&gt;abstraction from the matrix of conditions which</i><br>
<i>&gt;underlie the existence of something.</i><br>
<p>
But observer-related need not imply nonobjective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[CUT] Consider</i><br>
<i>&gt;for example an instruction in a computer program to</i><br>
<i>&gt;"beep" (make a beeping noise). [CUT] It is immaterial</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the same way as a melody, the rules of chess, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;plan, or an idea. Yet we all agree that what just</i><br>
<i>&gt;caused the computer to beep was the beep command in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the program it was running. Wait a minute! It</i><br>
<i>&gt;*wasn't* the instruction in the program that caused</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, it *was* the configuration of voltages across</i><br>
<i>&gt;transistor junctions. But they are the same thing! No</i><br>
<i>&gt;they're not!</i><br>
<p>
But even so, the explanations do not contradict one<br>
another and fit together well.  Remove the instruction<br>
from the program and, ceterus paribus, the beep will<br>
not happen.  Likewise, remove the speaker wires<br>
and, ditto, ditto.:)  To use another example, imagine<br>
you witness one woman shoot another.  The shot<br>
man dies.  You assign the cause of her death as<br>
the other woman.  The medical examiner assigns<br>
the cause as a bullet wound to the heart.  Etc.<br>
Do the various views conflict?  No.  Instead they<br>
fit together just like my friend and I seeing my bath-<br>
robe from different angles.  (He might even be<br>
color blind.)  His view is not wrong while mine is<br>
right, or vice versa, we just have different yet<br>
integratable perspectives.<br>
<p>
This is not to say any causal picture is right.  The<br>
person who believes that the gods caused the<br>
computer to beep, or magic made the woman die,<br>
or a government conspiracy makes the bathrobe<br>
look different to Bob and me has made a mistake<br>
-- entertaining as it might be.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's the sort of trap you fall into when you</i><br>
<i>&gt;stretch "cause" too far. We know exactly what is</i><br>
<i>&gt;meant by an immaterial computer program causing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical action. There is no magic, no need for some</i><br>
<i>&gt;special ontologically distinct realm where</i><br>
<i>&gt;information and ideas reside which has some</i><br>
<i>&gt;specialised kind of causal connection to the normally</i><br>
<i>&gt;causally closed world of physics. The Cartesian</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind-matter duality is an artefact of mistaking the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature of causality, a misdiagnosis of what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem is when causality falls to bits when you try</i><br>
<i>&gt;to use it to explain how software affects hardware</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how ideas affect men.</i><br>
<p>
Not really.  I don't accept Cartesian dualism or the<br>
alternative you offer.  Instead, I see causality as<br>
active in a universe that is a totality -- an integrated<br>
whole.  That mind is a material process does not<br>
mean causality is a chimera.<br>
