<i>&gt;To some extent, Microsoft's dominance derives from their illegal and unlawful</i><br>
<i>&gt;theft of intellectual property.  Even if intellectual property should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;abolished, as Lee advocates, Microsoft's competitors couldn't use Microsoft's</i><br>
<i>&gt;intellectual property,</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  Can you explain this last part?  If Int.Prop. was abolished, what<br>
would MS's Int.Prop. *be*, and why couldn't someone else use it??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and Microsoft was either stealing or using coercion so</i><br>
<p>
What is "stealing," if there is no property involved?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;that only it had free access to intellectual property</i><br>
<p>
What would it mean to have free access to something that was abolished?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;.  Unlawful, any way you</i><br>
<i>&gt;look at it.</i><br>
<p>
Um, what laws are you assuming I'm looking at it through?<br>
