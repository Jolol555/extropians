In a message dated 97-10-06 07:18:09 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 excuse me, but you have a lot to learn about what passes for ownership by<br>
 law in white man's world (theft, murder, extortion, prostitution)&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh?  and what, pray tell, might that be?  I have a couple of decades<br>
experience...as well as multiple college degrees regarding that very subject<br>
(business, management..etc)...but I will be the first to admit that my<br>
understanding of the intricicies are superficial and incomplete...please<br>
enlighten me...and I don't follow how theft, murder , extortion, or<br>
prostitution either follows or is relavant...<br>
<p>
do you mean theft as  practiced by the IRS?   Murder as practiced by the<br>
BATF?  And what's prostitution (of the sexual variety I assume?) got to do<br>
with anything...BTW prostitution is legal in Nevada...(with certain<br>
restrictions)..has been for decades...and seems to be working quiet<br>
well....I've seen "CatHouses" located in close proxmity to those dens of<br>
supersition and ignorance...churches....and they both seem to peacefully<br>
co-exist...<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;and from personal experience i'd be quite willing to bet((I cant say<br>
anything about his trucks...but he's by no means atypical...I know several<br>
much like him...me for instance...does that qualify for the bet?)) that the<br>
man's<br>
 trucks were part of a scheme outright owned and operated by a thief &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You are a theif?...otherwise how do you have this personal experience?  <br>
<p>
But nonetheless..there ARE multiple pathways to acheive his purported<br>
position..  For example...the one I took....I acquired my CDL (which required<br>
the ability to read and write by the way...but some rules are ignored for<br>
"minorities"...after all they have been soooooo abused by us evil mean white<br>
boys...and it would be unfair to expect them...given this abuse...to have to<br>
meet the same standards that we do)...and drove for a major carrier for a<br>
year or so...after that time I bought one of that carriers trucks...they<br>
required a thousand dollar downpayment...with financing thru a third party<br>
(Associates Financial Corp)...I then made my truck payments...paid the truck<br>
off...and viola!....I own a truck...free and clear...(no mafia needed)...<br>
<p>
I hired an accounting firm to do my paperwork...(the IRS and various<br>
theives...er...government agencies....regularly change the rules...in hopes<br>
of catching "violators"...and fining them...so it's best to have "hired guns"<br>
who keep up with sort of thing...and I didn't want to fool with it...when I<br>
quitt driving for the day I want to relax...not do paperwork...and it's cheap<br>
enough...less than $50 a month. So given that...he really WOULDN'T need to<br>
know how to read nor write..<br>
<p>
After that...I accumulated capital...(in the process changing<br>
carriers)..bought my own trailer (paid off)...and traded for a newer<br>
truck...(Stiiiiiiiiiiilll) no mafia needed.  The new truck cost more used<br>
than the old truck did new...I could have bought two less expensive<br>
trucks...hired a driver and continued the process toward the situation which<br>
"that man" has already attained...did I so desire...I don't...I'd rather have<br>
a nice rig...(and there are very few nicer)..and the freedom to do pretty<br>
well what I please...not having to worry about employees...(and addittional<br>
government rules, regulations, penalties..and costs...<br>
<p>
(read<br>
 mafia)...&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
could be...only I don't consider the mafia to be theives...they are<br>
unsanctioned free enterprise entreprenuers operating in an enviroment bereft<br>
of gov. subsidies...bringing products and services to those who are willing<br>
to pay for them...without regard to sanctions by the masters in charge who<br>
decree otherwise...( a very high risk business...requiring rather drastic<br>
business practices)..while I disagree with them in specifics...I agree with<br>
them in principle...and find little diference (in principle) between their<br>
activities and those of say , blockade runners during the civil war...or<br>
other cases of "smugglers" providing goods and services unallowed by the<br>
controlling regime.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; i suggest you pay a little attention to where the money is<br>
 coming from and going&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
all five trillion dollars of it? (per year....and growing...the drug<br>
money...and the under-ground economy on TOP of that.)...sorry...I gotta life<br>
to live...no time<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;to in this "economy" as they have the nerve to call<br>
 it - &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
five trillion (more actually) a year GNP...with hundreds of trillions of<br>
investment...surely this qualifies as an economy...(no quote marks<br>
required)...and it doesn't take much nerve...merely application of common<br>
english usage. <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;try the "cia-drugs" list, which only scratches the surface of our<br>
 wonderful means of "owning" our way of life. i have also had the<br>
 experience to know that people who are so defensive about "coming up from<br>
 nothing" have their own second thoughts about where the money REALLY came<br>
 from.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
first you're upset a about the mafia...now youre uptite about the REAL<br>
theives and scoundrels...the government...well so am I...but that has nothing<br>
to do with the fact that if youre willing to work hard you can make someting<br>
for yourself...<br>
<p>
 (actually, you have my sympathies, i have been there...believe me,<br>
 you're better off broke than dead to God.)           -velvet-<br>
<p>
I don't know if I need your sympathies or not...but you just lost all<br>
credibility with me at the mention of a construct of<br>
superstion....(apparently you are infected by a particularly virulent,<br>
long-lived, and destructive meme)....I thought we were conduciting a rational<br>
and reasoned discussion.<br>
<p>
Instead of sympathy...if you desire to exercise your "compassion", and/or if<br>
you agree that you lost you "bet", then I suggest you make a donation to The<br>
Libertarion Party, The Extropians, The ForeSight Institute, The Second<br>
Millenial Foundation....or just give a sawbuck to a hooker and then walk<br>
off....any of these actions will serve a more useful function than<br>
sanctimonious "sympathy"<br>
