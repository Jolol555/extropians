<p>
My investments tend to be somewhat time sensitive, but I have a couple<br>
recommendations that are good at this moment:<br>
<p>
1)  Triquint Semiconductor (TQNT - 29-5/8 per share):  Excellent<br>
investment, both short-term and long-term.  Expect at least 40% growth in<br>
the next 12 months.  The stock price dropped sharply recently because they<br>
said they expect earnings to be less than predicted for a couple quarters.<br>
Wall Street, as usual, overlooked the fact that they are still returning a<br>
very good EPS and are continuing to grow rapidly.  Unnoticed for years,<br>
this gallium-arsenide semiconductor manufacturer (no significant<br>
competitors!) has entered a boom as demand for efficient wireless<br>
communications and high-frequency circuits grows.  <br>
<p>
<p>
2)  Informix (IFMXE - 7-1/8 per share):  This is a more speculative<br>
investment, but fairly sound.  Wall Street often confuses management<br>
problems (and Informix has had some serious ones recently) with product<br>
problems, leading to the current rock-bottom stock prices.  However, as<br>
soon as the new management is in house I expect the price to rise to<br>
somewhere between $12-15/sh (far below recent historical prices) in the<br>
next 12 months.  In general, management problems tend to be transient, and<br>
product problems tend to be more persistent.  The current steep depression<br>
is a management problem and should rebound for a healthy profit if<br>
purchased while it is in the nether regions.  At this price it would be<br>
hard not too make a reasonable profit in an acceptable timeframe.<br>
