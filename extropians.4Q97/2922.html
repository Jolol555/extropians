 I couldn't agree more.<br>
<p>
I tried for a number of years to interest the NRA/ILA to propose a<br>
simple law based on this fact.<br>
<p>
I proposed that the law ban the depiction of guns, or there use, on<br>
TV and in the movies.<br>
<p>
Just imagine, no more cop shows, no more bang-bang shoot'em ups.<br>
<p>
The average kid would grow up without seeing the hundreds, (or is<br>
it thousands) of murders they now see by age 5.<br>
<p>
We ban gun advertising, why not the often illegal portrayal of<br>
there use?<br>
<p>
A "virtual" gun law?<br>
