In a message dated 97-10-11 10:46:07 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Many of us are rather unconventional people, who would not dream of<br>
 putting down something that had actual potential, but we also are mostly<br>
 trained well in the scientific method, so we can see holes in theories,<br>
 as well as outright flaws. If something cannot be experimentally proven<br>
 to work, then it isn't real, and we shouldn't waste our time with it. If<br>
 you want to beleive in unproven or disproven things, thats your<br>
 prerogative, but it shoulnd't be done on this list. If you want to prove<br>
 that something DOES work, then get into the lab and get cracking, and<br>
 come talk to us when you've got experimental proof. <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The thing is I HAVE been providing proof, but yall still wont accept it.<br>
 Such as, the reeds of the crop circles are changed in the chromosones, and<br>
many of them are also bent at the nodes (which is impossible to do if you<br>
tried).  Thats biology and vision at work.  Also, the water-powered cars, the<br>
guy gave directions on how to make them!  If you dont believe him make it<br>
yourself and see.  I cant think of the other stuff ive written but they are<br>
legit, like the sacred geometry site, they're using mathematics for what<br>
they're doing.  You're right, yall are dealing with conventional stuff, but<br>
there is a mystery to the world that you're just blowing off.<br>
