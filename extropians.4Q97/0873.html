In a message dated 97-10-27 02:43:58 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  The core is solid metal, mostly iron &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Time out....<br>
<p>
"The Education of Danny" has been real interesting...and I for one think it<br>
says something very positive that you guys...scientists and techs and what<br>
not...actually take the time to answer...even though he mostly doesnt<br>
listen,....and not just blow him off...<br>
<p>
I remember that when I was his age...nine or ten i expect...I had innumerable<br>
questions that no one would answer...such as how a Bergenholm<br>
worked...alas...I grew up..<br>
<p>
Howsomever and irrevocably nonetheless....now **I** gotta question....and I'm<br>
probably only marginally more informed than danny when it comes to plate<br>
techtonics, geology, thermogoddamnics and whatnot..<br>
<p>
I am , however, curious..and unfortunately...unconnected to the Net (again)<br>
<p>
And I heard (somewhere,can't remember, no references..but recently....sorry)<br>
that some evidence had been "unearthed" that the core of the earth was a<br>
single (huge) iron crystal...<br>
<p>
In accordance with principles set forth in "Demon Haunted World"....is this<br>
bogus?   or actually possible.<br>
