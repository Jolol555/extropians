Apparently you want to be careful in what you claim so that you cannot<br>
be contradicted by the facts.  Let me put you on the spot.<br>
<p>
Do you agree that human industrial activity is the principle cause of<br>
ozone depletion?<br>
<p>
If not, what do you think is causing ozone depletion?<br>
<p>
Do you agree that most chlorine in the upper atmosphere (where ozone<br>
depletion occurs) is due to human industrial activity?<br>
<p>
If not, what do you think is the source of most chlorine in the upper<br>
atmosphere?<br>
<p>
These are not trick questions.  These are fundamental questions which<br>
must be answered in dealing with the ozone problem.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Hal<br>
