I gained the impression from Jared Diamond's GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL that<br>
this kind of bacteriological warfare was largely inadvertent, despite the<br>
occasional egregious salting of contaminated blankets, etc.  Even without<br>
such criminal incidents, I suspect the microorganisms would have done their<br>
work anyway.  Diamond notes of deaths in the Mississippi Valley: `Eurasian<br>
germs, spreading in advance, did everything.  When Hernando de Soto became<br>
the first European conquistador to march through the southeastern US, in<br>
1540, he came across Indian town sites abandoned two years earlier because<br>
the inhabitants had died in epidemics... transmitted from coastal Indians<br>
infected [unintentionally] by Spaniards visiting the coast...  For the New<br>
World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the century or two<br>
following Columbus's arrival is estimated to have been as large as 95<br>
percent' (down from perhaps as many as 20 million).  (p. 211)  This<br>
astounding holocaust was mostly due to the inevitable microbiological<br>
ecology  transition, which as the first part of the quote demonstrates was<br>
bound to happen with or without malign human intervention.  We are less<br>
potent than we imagine, even in our powers for ill.<br>
