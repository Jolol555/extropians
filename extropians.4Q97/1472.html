After my book on the Singularity, THE SPIKE, was released in Australia<br>
several months ago, a number of people on these lists mentioned that it<br>
would be intriguing to see the public response to such ideas.  So far it's<br>
had surprisingly few newspaper or magazine reviews, despite many terrific<br>
radio interviews.  Two of them (one by a former chairman of the Commission<br>
for the Future, a quango think-tank)  were venomous and patronising; my<br>
published replies were somewhat sarcastic.  Now a more favorable response<br>
has appeared in the Age newspaper, one of the three major metropolitan<br>
papers in Australia, written by a former politician with a strong research<br>
interest in the Basque anarchists.  His review can be found at<br>
