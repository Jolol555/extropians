Hej!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1:1- How do I induce plasticity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Training seems to be the usual way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's too general a term for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1- How do I train for an intensification of neural plasticity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 1- What thoughts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 2- how hard,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 3- how long?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 4- How does blood pressure effect it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 5- How does diet effect it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How about calcium?</i><br>
<p>
Good questions. You may have noted that it took me a while to answer<br>
(I have piles of work), but it was worth it since I actually have some<br>
real facts now. As a neuroscientist it is easy for me to give vague<br>
answers about plasticity, but when I began to think about it things<br>
became much harder.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I listened to Michael Merzenich yesterday when he received an<br>
award from the Stockholm Physiology Society. He talked about his<br>
famous experiments on monkey sensory cortex, where he managed to<br>
change the somatotopic map (the map between the skin of the hand and<br>
the cerebral cortex) through training, and even blur the areas through<br>
overtraining. By training something very hard, you can really expand a<br>
sub-area at the expense of neighboring areas. Based on this research<br>
he then began to study how to train children with language problems<br>
and dyslexia, with some impressive results (his group was able to<br>
bring even quite autistic children into the normal statistical<br>
range). Furthermore, he appeared to be able to change some of the time<br>
constants of their hearing, which in itself is an amazing fact. <br>
<p>
What really makes the cortex plastic seems to be highly stereotyped<br>
movements combined with attention - acetylcholine is likely<br>
involved. Tension, high blood pressure and emotion can increase the<br>
acetylcholine release. The problem here is that overtraining is in<br>
general not something you want, it makes the brain *less* flexible and<br>
more stereotyped, even if you become brilliant at certain<br>
things. Still, it can be useful to "reformat" some cortex.<br>
<p>
Some learning factors which are likely useful:<br>
<p>
* Strong attention, high motivation<br>
* Repetition<br>
* Progressive training (it constantly becomes more challenging,<br>
	without becoming too challenging).<br>
* Adaptive and customized training (it adapts to your performance)<br>
* For each training session at each difficulty level, continue to<br>
	train until the results are satisfactory.<br>
<p>
I don't know about calcium, but I guess it is not a good idea to have<br>
too much or too little during training.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1:2- If there was hyperplasticity what would it be like,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;short term memory?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Do you mean a state of very high neural plasticity? In that case you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would likely learn fast but also forget fast, new memories would erase</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;old memories and stray thoughts would be remembered far too well. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ...sounds like short-term memory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1- What would mid-term memory be if anything?</i><br>
<p>
What I'm researching :-) You are right, short-term memory is likely so<br>
quick and plastic that it cannot hold much, while mid-term memory is<br>
the parts of the brain that can keep an impression for a longer time<br>
(say a few hours) until it can be encoded in permanent long term<br>
memory. It seems that the medial temporal lobe (the hippocampus and<br>
surrounding cortex) have this function.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How can the mind become more sensitive to other frequencies</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ie. radio, EM biofields)?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it can get more sensitive unless you start adding<br>
antennas (not likely a good idea) or instruments (like a radio).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1- What do neurons that get used often for a long time have?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Seems likely to me that short term memories lack that.</i><br>
<p>
Another very good question. We don't know yet, but it seems to involve<br>
restructuring of the cell, the branching of new synapses and<br>
production of new proteins.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2- Do cells detach and reattach to others?</i><br>
<p>
It is likely in the brain, and definitely occurs in some other tissues<br>
(fibroblasts are the most notable).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3- Is there an intermediate phase between approach and connection </i><br>
<i>&gt; in which signals may be passed?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe. There are neurotrophic factors that drift around, the diffuse<br>
volume conduction of some chemicals which may or may not be useful,<br>
and the retogerade messengers like nitrogen oxide which I don't really<br>
understand. I think there is a complex chemical dialogue going on<br>
around every neuron.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4- On average, what direction do axons point?</i><br>
<p>
Depends on where you are. In the brain, most seem to project either up<br>
or down to the thalamus, and locally perpendicular to the cerebral<br>
folds and ridges, or connect remote cortical areas with long, c-shaped<br>
bundles. But this is different in different parts of the brain. Some<br>
form diffuse networks, others move straight to their destinations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What happens during adaptation?</i><br>
<p>
A lot, I simply cannot give you a short answer. Try looking at Kandel<br>
et al, the memory chapter has IMHO an excellent overview.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1- What is "neural noise"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is that why my ears squeal?</i><br>
<p>
Sometimes. Usually it is the death cry of a single auditory<br>
neuron. Some neurons just fire spikes at random or due to random<br>
excitations in their environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I need a funtional brain map</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to see what tasks are next to eachother;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I've spent several hours looking but failed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We don't know where and how "Tasks" are stored, although we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reasonably good maps of some functions (like the visual cortex,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;primary motor system, speech etc).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please, </i><br>
<i>&gt; some good technical terms for brain map,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's all I need. </i><br>
<p>
I have started to look for it, I'll keep you posted. <br>
