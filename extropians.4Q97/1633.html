You got the blue-helmet feeling ;-)<br>

<p>
This was our exact feeling, it should be noted that Henri came up with<br>
Excedo _before_ he started subscribing to extropians@extropy.com, call it<br>
parallel evolution if you like.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;and there is a real risk/chance of being</i><br>
<i> &gt;linked with ExI (in Europe this can have tricky political connotations;</i><br>
<i> &gt;here in Sweden being a classic *liberal* is considered extreme,</i><br>
<i> &gt;libertarianism is beyond the pale). </i><br>
<p>
For precisely this reason we feel we cannot become a part of ExI, but it is<br>
certainly no reason to avoid contructive relations!<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;This is not likely to be a large or permanent problem, so I think we</i><br>
<i> &gt;should not invest too much emotional capital in this. The main problem</i><br>
<i> &gt;right now seems to be that a lot of us onlookers are cheering on the</i><br>
<i> &gt;two sides, almost forcing them into a silly confrontation. I'm not</i><br>
<i> &gt;sure I have any good solution, other than hope Max and Arjen can</i><br>
<i> &gt;discuss this and come up with a good solution. As transhumanists, we</i><br>
<i> &gt;all realize that names are merely (useful) labels, what really counts</i><br>
<i> &gt;is the contents.</i><br>
<p>
I think the discussion has been very civilized so far, and have the feeling<br>
that everybody want it to stay that way. I don't think anyone is 'out for<br>
blood'.<br>
I hope it's not just me and Max going 'head-2-head', My idea of a contest<br>
was to let everybody in on this (but maybe I'm and old-fashioned democrat).<br>
Names are labels but they do have 'marketing value'. New memes have to be<br>
promoted and a name that breaths expansion (whoops ;-) and speed will help.<br>
<p>
And now I _got_ to get some sleep ;-)<br>
<p>
