<p>
Not very constraining. The fastest signals in a biological brain move at <br>
about  100 meters a second, many are much slower. Light move at 300,000,000 <br>
meters a second and Nanotechnology can make things much smaller than a neuron. <br>
One second for a mind a billion times faster than ours would be like 30 years <br>
to us.        <br>

<p>
Yes.        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;IMHO this is a clearly chaotic system.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why? Life can assemble matter into very complex structures and I see nothing  <br>
about it less chaotic than Nanotechnology, rather the reverse.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The structure of any complex object created by this sort of nanotech        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;would seem to display an exquisite sensitivity to tiny variations in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;design of the assembler </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No more sensitive than the enzymes and ribosomes that built you and me.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;or the assembler "software"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No more sensitive than our DNA.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and possibly to the local environment itself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Just because a process is complex does not prove it is chaotic. Proteins <br>
start out as a linear sequence of amino acids that  can't do much, but then, <br>
in a manner too complex for any computer to simulate, they fold up into <br>
intricate shapes and that gives then their power. Despite their staggering <br>
complexity these shapes are  repeatable. If the shape of proteins were<br>
exquisite sensitivity to tiny  variations in the environment then they would <br>
never take the same shape twice  and life would be impossible.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm very interested in thoughts from the list on:  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps someday the rate of change will level off, but I'm just guessing and  <br>
that's all I can do when I try to figure out what a mind a billion times as  <br>
powerful as my own will come up with.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Will quantum computing have any benefit here?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you wanted to change the universe and could make a quantum computer of a  <br>
few dozen Qbits then you wouldn't have to wait for anything as prosaic as  <br>
Nanotechnology . The reason is that when a conventional 64 bit single  <br>
processor computer performs an operation, it does it on ONE 64 bit number at  <br>
a time. When a 64 Qbit single processor QUANTUM computer  performs an<br>
operation, it does it on ALL 64 bit numbers at the same time, all 2^64 of <br>
them, more than a billion billion, and any increase in the number  of qubits <br>
the computer can handle will increase it's already astronomical  power <br>
exponentially. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;My immediate question was whether Lent proposes that we build         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;traditional logic gates using this technique [quantum cellular         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;automation] to replace transistors, or whether he's proposing an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;entirely new type of computer architecture based on QCAs.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think he was talking about an new computer architecture.     <br>
               <br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;Given Planck space, c, and the maximum density matter can achieve         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;before collapsing into a black hole, what is the maximum achievable        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;computational power per unit volume?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's hard to see how to think about a volume less than the Plank length  <br>
across, or do anything in less than the plank  time. The reason is that as <br>
the wavelength of light gets smaller the energy gets larger, and so does  the <br>
mass, remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.  Thus at some point the wavelength is so <br>
small and the mass is so great that a mini Black Hole is formed with a <br>
singularity at its center.  The energy of the photon where this happens is  <br>
the Plank Energy, it is  E=  [hc^5/G]^1/2 = 1.22 *10^28 eV  where h is the  <br>
Plank constant divided by 2 PI, c is the speed of light, and G  is the  <br>
gravitational constant.   <br>
<p>
According to Heisenberg it is possible to get something for nothing, even in <br>
a vacuum you can borrow energy, but the more you borrow the  shorter you can <br>
keep it. The amount of energy and the length of time you can detect its <br>
existence is related in the same way as velocity and position, the more you <br>
have of one the less you have of the other. In this way a vacuum  is  full of <br>
virtual particles, but the Plank Energy is a LOT of energy so you  can't keep <br>
it for long.<br>
<p>
The Plank Time is t = [Gh/c^5]^1/2 = 5.38 * 10^-44 second , after this the   <br>
mini Black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. The Plank Length is  <br>
10^-33 cm, the distance light can travel in the plank time.<br>
<p>
This is a short distance, very short. If the universe was a thousand times as  <br>
large as what we now observe it, then this super universe would be to a  <br>
proton as a proton is to the Plank  Length.<br>
<p>
Now that's small, but what if we wanted to go even smaller? The singularity  <br>
in the center of the mini black hole is a place of infinite spacetime  <br>
curvature,  its a true mathematical singularity, so that means our current  <br>
laws of physics can't tell us what is going on when things get that little,  <br>
to do that we need a theory of quantum gravity and we don't have that yet.                          <br>

<i>        &gt;What about negative matter?  You can have an arbitary amount of</i><br>

<p>
<p>
Antimatter is a dime a dozen but it wouldn't help us because to gravity it's  <br>
the same as matter. I assume you're talking about anti mass and that's far  <br>
more exotic, but things may not be completely hopeless, we can already make <br>
it, or something like it.  If you place two large flat mirrors very close <br>
together then, unlike the vacuum on the outside of the mirrors, there can<br>
not be virtual photons of every wavelength in the vacuum between the mirrors <br>
because some will interfere destructively. There are more virtual particles <br>
in the vacuum outside the mirrors pushing them together than between the <br>
mirrors pushing them apart. This force is not strong but recently it has <br>
actually been measured in  the lab. 2 mirrors really do want to come together. <br>
<p>
If you define a vacuum far from any object as containing zero energy and thus <br>
mass, and if it is able to push the mirrors together because the space <br>
between the mirrors has less stuff in it, then that space between mirrors <br>
must have a negative mass.<br>
<p>
According to Kip Thorne a wormhole, like one made from a black hole, could <br>
not be used as a time machine or let you travel instantly to a distant galaxy <br>
because they are inherently unstable, the very act of entering one would <br>
destroy it. To stabilize a wormhole and make it useful you'd need something<br>
that pushes the wormholes walls apart gravitationally, you'd need something <br>
with a negative energy density, you'd need antimass. <br>

<i>        &gt;accuracy by Turing machines.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's true of randomness  and also of those weird instantaneous correlations <br>
quantum mechanics can sometime produce, but other than that a Turing machine <br>
can simulate any physical process, although not necessarily in polynomial time.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Even if all physical processes *are* simulable, they still use real         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;Mandelbrot-like boundary to perform calculations  of arbitrary         </i><br>

<p>
Well..., there are strange attractors and there are a hell of a lot of them. <br>
I don't know if it's been proven or not but I doubt if they could be put into <br>
a one to one correspondence with the real numbers, unfortunately I don't see <br>
how you could use this in computing. The shape of the attractor is known only <br>
approximately, in most cases they are infinitely complex fractals.  OK , <br>
you run your computer it gives you a point in phase space, now what?  <br>
That point could lie in an infinite number of attractors, which one is  <br>
correct? Run the machine  again, now you have 2 points, you have eliminated <br>
an  infinite number of attractors but unfortunately there are still an<br>
infinite  number left. To find the exact and not just approximate attractor <br>
you must  run the machine an infinite number of times and if you already <br>
could do that  then  no point in bothering with the Mandelbrot boundary.<br>
