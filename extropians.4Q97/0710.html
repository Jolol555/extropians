<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Curious.  I've always regarded that as the mating cry of the braindead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Damien Broderick</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Thanks.  That phrase has always disturbed me too, but I could never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quite put my finger on why.  Now it's clear: it is used by those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;regard social interaction more highly than private intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pursuits; perhaps because they lack confidence in their own abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and seek approval.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;sigh&gt; Go ahead, insult me.  I can take it.</i><br>
<p>
I did not insult you in any way, or make any personal comment, but I<br>
will make one now: if you continue to assume that others are attacking<br>
/you/ when they merely respond to your /ideas/ (as you have often<br>
assumed of me, because our ideas often conflict), you will discourage<br>
further exploration of those ideas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I beg to differ -- your thesis is anything but "clear".  When I say it, I mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the person I'm saying it to has lost sight of the importance of balance</i><br>
<i>&gt; in life.  Introspection alone cannot reveal reality -- you have to go look at</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  And while reading and writing are valuable, people wrote the books and</i><br>
<i>&gt; people read them, and words on paper cannot convey the richness of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience and interaction....</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps that's what /you/ meant--I can even believe you meant that<br>
because I know you--but I still think that most uses of "you need to get<br>
out more" are precisely as pegged: the mating call of the braindead,<br>
used by people to mean "I have no idea what you're talking about or<br>
why it's important; why aren't you talking about getting laid?"  If I<br>
wanted to tell someone that his amount of introspection as opposed to<br>
direct experience of life is too much, I'd use a different phrase (though<br>
I've never actually had occasion to do so, because most people I know<br>
are not introspective enough).<br>
