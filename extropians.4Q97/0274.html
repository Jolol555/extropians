Soviet/Chinese style state socialism is pretty well refuted, yes, as is<br>
whatever Britain was doing before Thatcher.  Is the welfare state itself<br>
discredited?  The US is doing well and Europe poorly at the moment, but<br>
it wasn't so long ago that things were the other way around.  And<br>
Europe's busy trying to shoehorn itself into a single currency, which<br>
currently (because of Jacobs' arguments) doesn't strike me as the<br>
brightest of ideas.  (Anyone know how Norway and Switzerland are<br>
doing?  Especially Norway.)<br>
<p>
And the stuff I was babbling about a few days ago was leftist anarchism,<br>
which has a larger track record than market anarchism.  Between 1936 and<br>
1939 much of Spain successfully went anarchist, becoming more productive<br>
than before the war (although repudiating debts would help the<br>
factories) and doing most of the fighting against the Fascists.  Whether<br>
the new society would have been stable over time, or in peace, or as<br>
innovative as the market, is unknowable.  And while the anarchists trumpeted<br>
the difficulties they had to overcome I can't help thinking that being<br>
caught up in a war of Good vs. Evil must help feelings of solidarity<br>
and avoidance of the selfishness we feel would break the system without<br>
the automatic restraint of private property. (And in my reading I did<br>
run across various things I didn't like.)  Still it did work for a<br>
while, and wasn't been observed to fail on its own merits, and involved<br>
a lot more people than the Libertarian Party can claim.<br>
<p>
Yes, market economies beat the hell out of anything else that's been<br>
properly tried.  Not all conceivable alternatives have been tried,<br>
however.  Particularly any variety of real anarchy other than the ones<br>
which degenerate into warlordism or involve unusual circumstances or<br>
entities (Internet, international law, fighting off Fascists and<br>
Communists simultaneously.)<br>
