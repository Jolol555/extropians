<i>&gt;Why was "Extropy" the lucky word ?</i><br>
<p>
I coined this work in January of '88 in the course of researching the<br>
information-based interpretation of entropy.  The roots "ex" and "tropy"<br>
essentially mean "out of" and "disorder."  I chose "ex" as an alternative to<br>
"en" in "entropy" because I sought a word that would indicated, in a general<br>
sense, a movement towards greater information.  I did not want to use<br>
"negentropy" because that already had a narrow, technical definition.<br>
<p>
Please note that I do not claim to be the first person to ever put together<br>
"ex" and "tropy"; I could never prove that claim at any rate.  But I do not<br>
think that any predecessor had used "extropy" in the sense that I intended,<br>
and that Max has so ably fleshed out.<br>
