$100 a year doesn't pay for a lot of luxury cars. No one is offereing<br>
$3000 nine-day intensive ExI workshops.<br>
<p>
No offense, but I think you need your cultometer adjusted.<br>

So are 4-H and the Rotarians. :)<br>

OK, you may be right. I don't have a glib answer for this. But I know what<br>
I don't like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Exactly.  Empiricism is important here.  In this respect, I think we</i><br>
<i>&gt; should bow to those who have been here longest.  If you read Harvey</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newstrom's post, you will see that making people pay does not reduce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; S/NR ratio since those who paid think they are getting ripped off if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't ramble on about irrelevant topics.</i><br>
<p>
Defense in depth: filtering will still be easier; and $95 is not $8.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True.  Which is why those who think someone's post is noise should just</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignore it.  If many people think it is noise, the noise-maker will get no</i><br>
<i>&gt; replies, and get discouraged through silence not to post irrelevant</i><br>
<i>&gt; material again.  The seems to me to be the best system (and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian)  Kennita Watson tend to be a strong advocate of this way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; policing the list, and I agree.</i><br>
<p>
I'd agree if it worked; it hasn't (either?) :) :)<br>
<p>
Leaving works. *shrug*<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Every decision has a cost. Good people are not doing their best on the list</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right now because of the current state of affairs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the cost is not worth the value.  If Harvey Newstrom is correct,</i><br>
<i>&gt; S/NR will not change significantly, so what is the value of restricting</i><br>
<i>&gt; posts to the list?</i><br>
<p>
ExI gets a little money, I get messages from people who felt like making a<br>
bet. I believe that Harvey's one data point deserves another.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Geoff.</i><br>
<p>
Geoff, I hope you undertand I'm not trying to throw weight around or<br>
bellyache. I am describing that I *expected* to have to pay, and was<br>
*disappointed* that I didn't.  Call me a mutant.<br>
