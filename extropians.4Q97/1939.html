Yes, people who get stressed by the expansion of the universe should<br>
learn to relax. But not too much... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There might be other things involved to.  Perhaps, on a global scale,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are not limited to topological changes...  For instance, perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and someone else has raised this possibility; so I make no claims to</i><br>
<i>&gt; originality here:) we can "tear" off a region in such a way as to</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieve just what Dyson was after.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is an interesting problem. Mitch made a suggestion a month<br>
ago on the transhuman list for a way of creating a closed<br>
mini-universe, but I think it wouldn't work in its proposed form (just<br>
an idea, Mitch: what about a non-spherical geometry?). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another intriguing possibility in an open universe is that entropy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; order can both increase -- in absolute NOT relative amounts.:)  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is Layzer's idea.  He might be wrong, but we should see if there's</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything to his idea.</i><br>
<p>
I think it sounds reasonable. Divide the universe into two sides, and<br>
use one as an entropy dump. If it gets too "hot", wait for a while<br>
until it has expanded, and then fump more entropy into it. Of course,<br>
I suppose this would run into the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) effect<br>
on a cosmic scale.... :-)<br>
