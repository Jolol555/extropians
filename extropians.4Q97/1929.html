I haven't read that much fiction with any uploading; most SF still<br>
prefers to use FTL.  (Much SF I consider analogous to a Victorian<br>
telling stories of a chemical rocket propelled British Empire on Mars,<br>
while overlooking Thomas Edison.)  What I have seen has been of the<br>
scanning variety.  (Okay, or of the programming variety, as in Pohl's<br>
Heechee books; someone actually writes a program which expresses a human<br>
intelligence.  Rrright.)  But when I made my comment I was actually<br>
thinking of what runs around the extropian web sites and mailing lists;<br>
if people have been listing "stick a small neural net in your brain and<br>
have it try to be you for 20 years" I've totally missed it.<br>
<p>
Australia seems to be the world capital of hard extropian fiction: Greg<br>
Egan, plus Vinge lets it be a world power in a couple of short stories<br>
(although only because the North had nuked itself and the rest of the<br>
South had burned its libraries in panic.)  And you perhaps, although I<br>
haven't read any of your books.  Any basis for this in real life?<br>

16 neurons and two dimensions.  Might end up on the shelf with the 10<br>
qubit quantum computer in a coffee cup.<br>
<p>
To link this with the cosmology thread, I'll note that old aliens in his<br>
Heechee books apparently closed the universe.  Pohl did not try<br>
suggesting how.<br>
