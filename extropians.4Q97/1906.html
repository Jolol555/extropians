I actually read this argument in Lucretius De Rerum Natura yesterday<br>
(wonderful book, by the way; I really recommend it), he argues that<br>
the universe must be infinite, since if you stood at the edge and<br>
threw a spear, it would either hang in the air (impossible, or<br>
requiring some force from the outside) or fly into space (and hence<br>
there is something out there). <br>
<p>
The fallacy in this argument is the assumption of some kind of edge,<br>
of course. But you can have a finite surface with no edges, like a<br>
sphere, and with nothing "outside it". A manifold (a surface, volume<br>
or spacetime) doesn't need to be embedded in anything at all to have<br>
an intrinsic geometry that is consistent and has all the necessary<br>
properties to run a physics; this is basic differential geometry, see<br>
any introductory book in the subject for a proof of Gauss Theorema<br>
Egregium. <br>
<p>
Of course, this *sounds* extremely counter-intuitive and silly to<br>
anybody who is used to handling objects embedded in three-space, but<br>
it is actually self-consistent and parsimonious. See any introductory<br>
book about cosmology for more discussions of how you can have a<br>
finite, closed space with no edges and nothing outside.<br>
