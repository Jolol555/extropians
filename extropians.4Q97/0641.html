Why transplant?<br>
<p>
I have maintained for years that the best way to get the average man<br>
on the street to readily accept and endorse any kind of genetic<br>
self-modification is to start with the teeth.  You'd think that one of<br>
the easiest genetic tricks in our upcoming bag of party favors would<br>
be dental regeneration.<br>
<p>
I don't the party is quite warranted yet, though.<br>
<p>
While the possibility of brain transplants, raised elsewhere, is quite<br>
attractive, we _do_ need to wait for the technology to actually<br>
perform a brain transplant.  Another downside is the need to wait 18<br>
to 20 odd years for any clone bodies grown _right now_ to reach any<br>
reasonable form of physical maturity.  I don't know about the rest of<br>
you, but even if it were possible to cram an adult human brain into a<br>
three year old body, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun.<br>
<p>
Talk about an industry, though-- the care and feeding of decerebrated<br>
clones.  How much per day do you figure it would cost to care for a<br>
decerebrated clone?  To make sure it is properly fed by whatever means?<br>
Can't have a clone come out of the tank malnourished.  To make sure it<br>
is exercised by some means?  Don't want an emaciated, atrophied clone<br>
stumbling out of the tank.<br>
<p>
I'm confident there are ways to do this all in the tank, as it were,<br>
but I wouldn't think it would come cheap.  Once an economy of scale<br>
sets in, how much would you pay per day pe clone?  Ten dollars?<br>
Twenty?  Fifty?  <br>
<p>
Think again when you consider that a conservative prospective immortal<br>
might want to keep two or three clones in the tank at all times, as<br>
insurance against accidental death and dismemberment, as well as<br>
cloning malpractice.  ("What good is a money back gaurantee!?  You<br>
gave me a clone with Parkinson's Disease, you goober!")<br>
