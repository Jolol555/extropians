<p>
A good question. Evolution is based on three things: reproduction,<br>
variation and selection. It is the selection step that kills, at least<br>
so far. But if resources are unlimited, there is no need to kill off<br>
unfit units, they will be out-bred by their fitter relatives. So one<br>
way of having progress without killing anybody is to get unlimited<br>
resources to grow in. Too bad about Malthusian reality, even in a<br>
technosphere growing with lightspeed...<br>
<p>
However, the creation of new threads could of course be done with more<br>
finesse than the current "shake the dice" method - instead of relying<br>
on luck and some skill at upbringing we could use what we know to<br>
increase the likeliehood that the new thread will be fit and happy and<br>
make it less probable that it will be terminated for some<br>
reason. Quality over quantity. Of course, evolution and selection<br>
still occurs, but now we weed out a lot of unfit *potential*<br>
phenotypes instead of real phenotypes.<br>
<p>
Hmm, I feel quite at home with talking about child rearing (for this<br>
is what it really is) in terms of process forking, evolutionary<br>
strategies and selection. I wonder if this is rare? :-)<br>
