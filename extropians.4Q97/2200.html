<p>
Conspiracy theories certainly are sexy at the moment. Linda Thompson,<br>
the American lawyer who is the public spokesperson for the so-called<br>
militias, the people in the backwoods of America who think Bill<br>
Clinton is trying to usher in an America Reich, got half an hour on<br>
BBC TV last autumn. Look at the impact of 'The X Files'. I've been<br>
contacted by five or six TV companies in the past six months - two<br>
last week - all interested in making programmes about conspiracy<br>
theories. I even got a call from the Big Breakfast Show, from a<br>
researcher who had no idea who I was, asking me if I'd like to appear<br>
on it. He'd seen me billed as speaking here. The first thing of<br>
consequence that he asked me was: "What is the weirdest conspiracy<br>
theory you've come across recently?" He wanted me to appear on this<br>
wacky morning show and tell the viewers something wacky.<br>
<p>
I said, I didn't think I was quite what the Big Breakfast was looking<br>
for. He asked me what kind of magazine 'Lobster' was. (He'd never<br>
heard of it, of course.) I said it had no pictures and that I'd once<br>
published an article in it about the Moonies and the Korean CIA,<br>
which had two hundred and sixty two footnotes, citing work in five<br>
languages. I could hear his interest waning. I sent him a few copies<br>
of 'Lobster' anyway; and - guess what? - he never called back.<br>
<p>
Compare and contrast this situation with, say, 1963. Who was<br>
interested in conspiracy theories in 1963? In the UK, a handful of<br>
disgruntled racist Tories - the League of Empire Loyalists - and<br>
little groups of Hitler lovers clinging to the old Jewish banking,<br>
world domination myth. In the US, the John Birch Society and a<br>
handful of old time anti-Semites and American Hitler freaks.<br>
Conspiracy theories were out on the margin of the margins in 1963.<br>
Last year - was it? - on 'The X Files', one of the FBI agents<br>
dismissed someone as "one of the people who believe Elvis is dead".<br>
(Or so I have been told; I've never watched an entire episode of 'The<br>
X Files'.)<br>
<p>
These days we've got conspiracy theories everywhere; and about almost<br>
everything.<br>
<p>
<p>
CONSPIRACIES WITHOUT EVIDENCE<br>
<p>
Here are a few choice examples from the last few months - this is the<br>
stuff the Big Breakfast show wanted to hear about.<br>
<p>
Two conspiracy theory books about the OJ Simpson case appeared in the<br>
Tom Davis catalogue in December. In the interesting one, the Davis<br>
catalogue summary says, the FBI blacklisted bar applicants - i.e.<br>
would-be lawyers - because of anti-war activities. Unemployed for<br>
years, these unemployed lawyers assassinated Nicole Simpson and<br>
framed OJ Simpson to compel the FBI to disclose the blacklist. Only<br>
in America, with one million lawyers, the home of the lawyer joke,<br>
would someone imagine a murderous cabal of unemployed lawyers!<br>
<p>
Nearer to home (but nearly as far off the planet) somebody called<br>
Michael Todd, who lives in Selby, in Yorkshire, for a mere #95, is<br>
offering to provide evidence of a world-wide conspiracy called<br>
Operation PELT, with a secret HQ in Ireland and thirty offices<br>
world-wide. The aim of PELT, by the way, is to destroy the entire<br>
alternative movement; health, green, eco etc. I wrote asking for<br>
evidence, but did not get a reply.<br>
<p>
The Administrator of the anti-fluoride, National Pure Water<br>
Association wrote to me suggesting that the reason for the<br>
vilification of Yorkshire Water in the summer and autumn of last<br>
year, was Yorkshire Water's refusal to add fluoride to their water.<br>
She wrote: "Much of the persecution of that Company this year -<br>
leaks, dry reservoirs etc. - is, we are sure, orchestrated<br>
`punishment' for their decision." I wrote asking her for evidence,<br>
but received no reply.<br>
<p>
A UFO buff I know slightly tried to persuade me that the US has a<br>
secret base built under Loch Lomond in Scotland, from which emerge<br>
mysterious craft. (The UFOs as underwater craft is one of the minor<br>
themes amongst UFO theories.) Why, said I, would they put such a base<br>
under the single most popular tourist spot in the west of Scotland,<br>
visited every day by hundreds, if not thousands of people?<br>
<p>
The difficulty - or the delight - for people like me is that buried<br>
in the stupid nonsense there is something of interest in almost all<br>
of these fields. There surely isn't a US base under Loch Lomond, and<br>
there surely isn't a secret conspiracy between the ET greys and the<br>
US government; and there surely aren't millions of Americans being<br>
kidnapped and sexually assaulted by aliens.<br>
<p>
But - a big but - this doesn't mean that the entire UFO thing can be<br>
rationally written off as nonsense, hallucinations or whatever. There<br>
are now too many video tapes of strange things in the sky to add to<br>
the many reports from sensible, rational people. (The ubiquitous<br>
camcorder may yet resolve lots of this for us.)<br>
<p>
The anti-fluoride case, after years of being on the crank list is<br>
creeping into the mainstream. Even 'Covert Action', the very serious,<br>
American, neo-Marxist, anti-imperialist, spy-watching journal has<br>
published an article on the fluoride issue (something that would have<br>
been unimaginable five years ago). The damage done to the<br>
anti-fluoride case by Sterling Hayden's portrait in 'Dr Strangelove'<br>
of the crazed US base commander, obsessed with the communist<br>
conspiracy to pollute America's precious bodily fluids, is being<br>
overcome, albeit slowly.<br>
<p>
<p>
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY, BUT ...<br>
<p>
But once you make that initial move of trying to deal with these<br>
areas rationally, it gets very difficult very quickly. One of the<br>
subjects generating conspiracy theories at the moment is that which<br>
is now called mind control. We know that the CIA et al, and their<br>
Soviet counterparts, were busy in the fifties and sixties looking for<br>
a means of controlling the human mind. Drugs, hypnosis - even one or<br>
two little US projects, still not disclosed, which seemed to be<br>
interested in electromagnetic fields. But there are now hundreds of<br>
people, in Europe and in the USA - I know someone dealing with<br>
seventy such cases in the USA - claiming to have been mind<br>
controlled; some claim to have implants in their head, or their body;<br>
they are being bombarded by energy weapons of some kind; they are<br>
being controlled. Timothy McVeigh, the alleged Oklahoma bomber,<br>
claims to have an implant in his body. I have photocopies of X-rays<br>
which appear to show something in some individuals in Sweden. Brain<br>
scans are now available in home-pages on the Net, apparently showing<br>
the same sort of thing. There are now agencies in the USA which, for<br>
a large amount of money, will debug your body. Used to be your house<br>
or office or car; now its your body. They will check you out - and<br>
remove, if necessary - bugs, implants, chips, whatever. I've got the<br>
written statements of half a dozen or more such victims in this<br>
country. I have been corresponding with, and have met, two people who<br>
tell me they hear voices in their head - the voices of teams of<br>
psychologists and intelligence personnel monkeying around with their<br>
brains. I could just say, they're paranoid schizophrenics - one of<br>
the classic symptoms of which is hearing voices in your head. Except<br>
that (a) I've known some schizophrenics and these two men don't seem<br>
like schizos to me; and (b) more importantly, the technology to do<br>
what they claim is being done to them may exist. As far back as 1962<br>
an American scientist called Alan Frey demonstrated that, using a<br>
microwave beam, you could transmit sounds - words - into the head of<br>
an individual that were inaudible to other people. A Freedom of<br>
Information application by Jane Affleck produced a document from<br>
1970, a report published by the Office of Technological Utilization<br>
in NASA called 'Implantable Biotelemetry Systems' - implants, in<br>
short. Twenty five years ago they had them down to the size of a 5p<br>
piece. This 1970 report shows them, even gives wiring diagrams. Now,<br>
twenty five years later, some of them are practically invisible, like<br>
a strand of hair.<br>
<p>
I don't mean I believe that there are people with implants; I have<br>
not yet seen any convincing evidence of this. Photocopies of X-rays<br>
don't quite make it. And even if there are such people, even if<br>
somebody turns up with evidence that can't be ignored, it is a long<br>
step from the existence of implants to the remarkable things claimed<br>
for them. How would an implant in your teeth, say, control your<br>
thoughts? But given the technology that existed in 1970, it is simply<br>
not possible to dismiss this stuff out of hand. No, it doesn't seem<br>
likely. But would you really be surprised to learn that the CIA or<br>
some other branch of the US government (or its NATO allies) were<br>
doing random tests of this technology? That's what they did with<br>
various nerve agents and LSD in the fifties - just sprayed it round<br>
to see what happened. And, after all, if NATO scientists are trying<br>
out microwave weapons or mind entrainment devices, these kinds of<br>
tests have the most perfect cover of all: no-one will believe the<br>
victims.<br>
<p>
Similar difficulties arise with the various conspiracy theories now <br>
surrounding the Oklahoma bombing. It doesn't seem likely to me that <br>
the Federal government did blow up the building themselves to give <br>
them a pretext to clamp down on the militias, as some on the right <br>
are now suggesting; or that the explosion was caused by a stray US <br>
missile as some others claim. But given what we know the US military <br>
and intelligence services have done in the past twenty five years, <br>
and given the incompetence of the military, these can't be instantly <br>
dismissed either.<br>
<p>
<p>
FACT AND FANTASY<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, most of the conspiracy theories floating around are<br>
crap; there is no evidence, and when evidence is offered, the<br>
evidence is crap. But why is this stuff on the increase? Why, after<br>
producing 'Lobster' for thirteen years have I now been asked to<br>
address this august if slightly cranky assembly? [See front page<br>
notes - ed.] One factor is the increasing availability of computer<br>
technology. I first began to notice conspiracy theories in the late<br>
1970s as a by-product of getting interested in the Kennedy<br>
assassination. In those days getting a decent-looking magazine<br>
together was expensive. You had to pay for typesetting. The fringe<br>
mags looked like fringe mags. These days about #700 will buy computer<br>
kit with which you can turn out an imitation of the 'Wall Street<br>
Journal' if you want to; and with a fax machine you can spread it<br>
round the world. There has been an increase in conspiracy theories;<br>
but its also that those that exist are getting round much faster than<br>
they used to.<br>
<p>
Another factor is the increasing difficulty people have in working<br>
out what is real and what is not. In the USA Mrs and Mrs Joe Sixpack<br>
are faced with thirty, sixty, a hundred and twenty cable channels of<br>
TV putting out varieties of piffle at best; tabloid papers like the<br>
'National Enquirer' and all its imitators in supermarkets putting out<br>
honest-to-god inventions as `news'; endless right-wing radio talk<br>
shows pumping out nonsensical conspiracy theories about the evils of<br>
liberalism. The chances are very high that the Sixpacks haven't read<br>
a book of any kind in the previous year - maybe not since they left<br>
school. And the Sixpacks may have been born again: America is a<br>
profoundly religious society. People who believe in God and the<br>
Devil, people who are waiting for "rapture", haven't that far to go<br>
to believe that the sky at night is swarming with UFOs looking for<br>
people to abduct and experiment on.<br>
<p>
The claim that people are finding it harder to distinguish between<br>
fantasy and reality is difficult to sustain and is always poo-poohed<br>
by people in the garbage media who claim that people know, for<br>
example, that the 'Daily Sport' or the 'National Enquirer' are not<br>
meant to be taken seriously. But I'm not so sure. The 'Sunday<br>
Telegraph' of 4th February this year carried a story about a<br>
policeman in London who was psychic. The policeman concerned was<br>
quoted as saying: "At first my colleagues in the police force thought<br>
it was all a bit odd. But since the BBC programme 'The X Files', many<br>
have given it a lot more credence." But 'The X Files' is fiction.<br>
<p>
I have seen the explosion in conspiracy theories attributed to the<br>
approach of the millennium. Maybe it has some effect on some of the<br>
religious groups, but the average citizen doesn't seem to me to give<br>
a toss about the millennium. Me neither. It'll just be like New<br>
Year's Eve with more drinking and better fireworks, and back to work,<br>
and endless TV programmes looking back over the century. I'll bet<br>
they're busy making them now.<br>
<p>
<p>
A VAST MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX<br>
<p>
Another factor in the rise of conspiracy theories is the existence of<br>
real conspiracies in recent US history. Look at American history<br>
since 1963: the assassination of the Kennedys, Dr King, most of the<br>
Black Panther leadership and Jimmy Hoffa; the shooting of Governor<br>
George Wallace. The revelation of CIA plots against foreign leaders.<br>
Massive domestic surveillance and disruption programs by the FBI and<br>
CIA. The CIA shipping opium in Laos and Vietnam, organising forty,<br>
fifty thousand assassinations in Vietnam under the Phoenix programme;<br>
tens of thousand more in Indonesia. Secret wars all round the globe<br>
trying to police the US empire. All this began to emerge in the 1960s<br>
after the destruction of the Warren Commission Report on the<br>
assassination of JFK and the revelations continued through the 1970s<br>
as part of the spin-off from Watergate. Since the advent of<br>
Republican administrations in the eighties we've had Irancontra; the<br>
October Surprise; the clandestine arming of Iraq; billions of dollars<br>
ripped-off from the Savings and Loan banks; hundreds of thousand of<br>
corpses in Central America - including a few American nuns - created<br>
by death squad regimes working as US proxy governments. A vast<br>
military-industrial-intelligence complex - everything President<br>
Eisenhower warned America of in his farewell speech in 1960 - totally<br>
beyond democratic control, gobbling up hundreds of billions of<br>
dollars.<br>
<p>
Added to which, with Clinton and the Democrats in office, the<br>
Republican Party and its allies on the right are churning out<br>
conspiracy theories about Clinton. Some of these, about his role in<br>
the leasing of Arkansas to the CIA and the Reagan White House to run<br>
guns into Central America and cocaine back, seem to be true, or<br>
true-ish. The rest, especially the paranoia about Clinton trying to<br>
engineer an American Reich, suspending elections and putting the US<br>
under UN control, strike me as dotty in the extreme. Some of it looks<br>
political pay-back; the right having their revenge for the long line<br>
of Republican disasters beginning with Watergate and Nixon which were<br>
exploited - however incompetently - by the Democrats.<br>
<p>
The cumulative effect of all this is that some redneck yahoo in the<br>
boondocks, with his weapons, a year's supply of canned food and<br>
Pepsi, his AppleMac and his fax machine can say: "Hey, buddy, don't<br>
tell me I'm paranoid, all right? Look at what we know the<br>
sons-of-bitches in Washington have done already! And that's just the<br>
bits we know about."<br>
<p>
So: why are we getting more conspiracy theories? Technology,<br>
AppleMacs and faxes, information overload; the whole buttressed by<br>
what I'm still willing to call the objective reality of US political<br>
practice. Looked at another way: here we are in Uncle McCluhan's<br>
global village; and what is village life like? Word of mouth, rumour,<br>
gossip - most of it inaccurate. Maybe conspiracy theories are just<br>
the gossip of the global village.<br>
<p>
If I am talking mostly about America it is because America seems to<br>
be the source of most of this nonsense. I could be wrong. It may be<br>
that since I don't read any foreign language news sources or watch<br>
other countries' TV, I am simply unaware of, say, Austrian conspiracy<br>
theory culture; or Taiwanese. There are a lot of conspiracy theories<br>
on the right of Japanese politics, including some bizarre<br>
anti-Semitic theories - bizarre because there are no Jews in Japan.<br>
And there is clearly an upsurge of anti-Jewish theories in the former<br>
Soviet Union and its empire; but anti-Semitism has been there since<br>
the last century that I know of, and probably centuries earlier. But<br>
as far as Britain is concerned this stuff is mostly coming across the<br>
Atlantic. And it's mostly coming from white people.<br>
<p>
There are some black conspiracy theories. Some of the black American<br>
religious sub-cultures apparently believed that Reagan had "666", the<br>
mark of the beast, tattooed on the back of his skull, under his hair;<br>
others believe that the distribution of heroin among the black<br>
population to a plot by the government to keep black Americans down.<br>
This is a sort of progenitor of the theory that AIDS was a biological<br>
warfare experiment which escaped. Joshua Nkomo in Zimbabwe was<br>
expounding this thesis in early April - his son died of Aids - with<br>
the twist that it was a germ warfare experiment designed by whites to<br>
kill blacks. (This Aids-as-germ-warfare-run- amok theory came from<br>
the Soviet Union; the KGB ran it through various third world media in<br>
revenge for the CIA conspiracy theory which blamed the KGB, through<br>
the Bulgarians, for the attempt to assassinate the Pope.) There are<br>
many other black conspiracy theories - enough to fill a book this<br>
year by an American academic. But mostly it's white folk churning<br>
this stuff out; at any rate its white folk's theories which are<br>
getting the attention in the white-dominated mass media. And that is<br>
the clue.<br>
<p>
<p>
"WHO'S BEHIND THIS?"<br>
<p>
For it seems to me that the underlying cause of the explosion in<br>
conspiracy theories is the decline of the US empire. The American<br>
dream is faltering; at best, wage rates are no higher than they were<br>
twenty years ago for many of the working class. For many they are<br>
lower. There are said to be eighty thousand homeless people on the<br>
streets of Chicago. The gap between the top strata in the US and the<br>
bottom is wider than it has been since the war, and getting wider<br>
every year. Things are not going according to plan for many white<br>
Americans, and they need to explain this to themselves.<br>
<p>
You can see the change reflected in the accounts of encounters with<br>
Extra Terrestrials. In the 1950s, when the US empire was booming, and<br>
Mr and Mrs Average White American consumer was being fed a relentless<br>
diet of stories predicting ever-increasing material prosperity, the<br>
Extra Terrestrials reportedly contacting the America citizen, were<br>
largely - but not wholly - benign. Now the US empire is falling apart<br>
and sections of the big American cities are turning into a reasonable<br>
facsimile of the set of 'Blade Runner', the skies over American at<br>
night are apparently bustling with hundreds of thousands of Alien<br>
Rapists, beaming down into peoples' bedrooms.<br>
<p>
But since only two per cent of Americans have read a book in the last<br>
year, and their primary source of information, the TV, does not deal<br>
with such issues, the ability of most of them to explain something as<br>
complicated as the economic decline of a great power is limited.<br>
<p>
And there is a psychological dimension: so deeply ingrained is the<br>
myth of America, the country of manifest destiny, the shining torch<br>
of freedom, democracy and the American way, the land of the brave and<br>
the home of the free, that most Americans seem to find it hard,<br>
verging on impossible, to believe that there is something wrong with<br>
the system. But if the system is fine, and things are going wrong,<br>
the problems are being caused by ... bad people.<br>
<p>
Somebody's to blame! Somebody's behind this!<br>
<p>
This is the approach of the most visible conspiracy theorist in the<br>
UK today, David Icke, erstwhile TV sports presenter and green<br>
activist, who lost his TV job for supporting the Green Party. Icke's<br>
a good-looking guy and he's been on TV, and that's enough for lots of<br>
people, I suspect. David lectures; they turn up, give him a fiver to<br>
get in. There's an Icke video, David recorded talking in a theatre in<br>
Liverpool. Icke lines up all our discontents; lists all the terrible<br>
things that are being done to the planet and the catastrophe<br>
approaching. That takes about fifteen minutes. He then asks the<br>
audience, not "What is the cause or causes of this?", but "Who is<br>
behind this?" Once you ask that question, you're off into uncharted<br>
territory. His answer is a mish-mash of American conspiracy theories<br>
about semi-clandestine groups like the Trilateral Commission, the<br>
Council on Foreign Relations; and to that he adds a smattering of<br>
ufology's greatest hits - Majestic 12, the alliance with the Greys;<br>
and old chestnuts like the Illuminati. Like many of his American<br>
sources, Icke's methodology is, roughly: if it's in print it must be<br>
true.<br>
<p>
<p>
"CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE ALWAYS WRONG"<br>
<p>
The difficulty for a naive empiricist or rationalist like me is that<br>
in a sense the people who are currently producing and recycling all<br>
the rubbish about global conspiracies, the David Ickes and William<br>
Coopers of this world, are right. But only in a sense. Some of the<br>
world's politics and economics is influenced - but not controlled -<br>
by little groups of people. The Bilderberg Group does exist, does<br>
meet. The Trilateral Commission does exist, does meet occasionally<br>
and discuss a new world order. After all, these are the guardians of<br>
capital, and disorder is what they don't want. Global investment<br>
likes order. There are bankers ripping us off - but few of them are<br>
Jewish. David Icke and the many Americans from whom he has adopted<br>
these ideas, have a little nugget of truth there, but thanks to the<br>
way they use it, they contaminate the subject matter and unwittingly<br>
play into the hands of the very people they think they are opposing.<br>
<p>
For most of the chattering classes - the media and knowledge<br>
industry, academics, politicians and their assistants - the epithet<br>
`conspiracy theorist' is the kiss of death. One of the bed-rocks of<br>
the ideology of liberal democracies is that conspiracy theories are<br>
always wrong, and those who espouse them are mental incompetents at<br>
best. This unquestioned belief usually manifests itself in the<br>
endless genuflections like this: "of course I'm not a believer in the<br>
conspiracy theory of history", or: "as usual the cock-up theory of<br>
politics turned out to be true". Indeed, I would say that the<br>
espousal of the belief in the cock-up or coincidence theory of<br>
history is at the heart of what passes for political and intellectual<br>
sophistication in liberal democracies.<br>
<p>
This is understandable up to a point. Who wants to be associated with<br>
nutters who believe the world's being run by a cabal of American<br>
politicians and extra-terrestrials? Or the Masons? What irritates me,<br>
however, is that this legitimate allergy to mega conspiracy theories<br>
extends much further than the crazy fringe to a general prohibition<br>
on conspiracies. And this is very strange, because it is blindingly<br>
obvious - is it not? - that political parties, for example, are<br>
intrinsically conspiratorial. Routine internal party politics is a<br>
network of interlocking cabals plotting how to get their hands on<br>
this group, committee, caucus meeting, council, party, pressure<br>
group. It is only a slight exaggeration to say, as Carl Oglesby did<br>
in the early 1970s, that conspiracy is normal politics. Yet this idea<br>
would produce everything from outrage to patronising shakes of the<br>
head from almost all intellectual and political circles in this<br>
country. "Really, old boy, the world just isn't like that."<br>
<p>
I met this view of the world on my first visit the Newsnight office<br>
in 1986. I was then trying to persuade the media to take seriously<br>
the allegations of Colin Wallace about anti-Labour activities by the<br>
intelligence services in the 1970s. Wallace was then still in prison<br>
- he was framed on a manslaughter charge. I had written to him and<br>
mentioned that I would be visiting Newsnight and Wallace wrote back<br>
warning me that up in the higher reaches of the BBC was a man called<br>
Alan Protheroe, who was an asset of the British secret state and who<br>
knew Wallace and what Wallace had been up to in Northern Ireland in<br>
1974. When I met the Newsnight journalist who was interested in<br>
Wallace and was proposing to interview him when he came out of<br>
prison, I said "Wallace says watch out for Protheroe. He thinks he<br>
will ky-bosh your interview."<br>
<p>
I got the patronising smile of the higher media who know everything:<br>
"Oh come on, the BBC isn't like that." What happened? Wallace was<br>
interviewed, and Protheroe blocked its transmission. The BBC then<br>
denied that the interview had ever taken place. About a year later it<br>
was revealed that M15 actually had an office inside the BBC from<br>
which it vetted applicants for BBC jobs.<br>

HOW THE IDEOLOGY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY DENIES REALITY<br>
<p>
The belief that our society "just isn't like that" is a part of the<br>
ideology of liberal democracy, which I identify as the concept of<br>
pluralism. This is mostly what's taught in Anglo-American<br>
universities. The last time I took a look at it, British academic<br>
politics was still wrestling with the discovery that interest and<br>
pressure groups intrude into the model of Westminster party politics.<br>
But the problem with `pluralism' is that it is essentially empty,<br>
merely telling us that many groups in society have some power. The<br>
interesting questions begin where pluralism stops.<br>
<p>
A real world perspective - what I would call a parapolitical<br>
perspective - on the other hand, takes it for granted that there are<br>
clandestine influences at work in society. Not the ridiculous,<br>
world-controlling conspiracies like the Masons, or the Illuminati, or<br>
other such nonsense, but more mundane things like intelligence<br>
agencies manipulating domestic and international politics; companies<br>
buying government policies by making anonymous donations to the Tory<br>
Party etc. It became absurd to deny the existence of large-scale<br>
political conspiracies, of powerful `hidden forces', as soon as the<br>
existence of the CIA - or KGB or SIS - was revealed. The interesting<br>
questions, the rational questions, are not: Are there such things as<br>
covert influences - conspiracies - in political or social life?, but:<br>
Given that there manifestly are such things, where are they? Whose<br>
are they? How important are they? How can we tell fantasy from<br>
reality? And - I would argue - how do we put a stop to them?<br>
<p>
Simple empirical observation says conspiracy is a very common form of<br>
political behaviour. The mysterious thing is not that some poor<br>
deluded fools insist on seeing conspiracies, but how it is that, for<br>
so long, so many otherwise apparently intelligent people - most of<br>
Anglo-American political science, for example - have, until very<br>
recently, managed not to notice that conspiracy is an everyday and<br>
rather important part of the phenomena they purport to be studying.<br>
Let me give a couple of examples. Since its formation in the 1920s<br>
until its demise about five years ago, the Economic League collected<br>
and spent, in today's money, millions of pounds every year working<br>
against the British left. It may have spent as much as the<br>
Conservative Party since World War I. Yet there was not one academic<br>
essay about the Economic League between its formation and 1980. Not<br>
one in sixty years. No account of British domestic politics in the<br>
twentieth century can be anything but hopelessly incomplete without<br>
incorporating the Economic League, but I have never seen one that<br>
does.<br>
<p>
Academic American history somehow manages to skip over the fact that<br>
in a five year period in the sixties one President, the probable next<br>
President, and the most important black leader since the war were<br>
victims of assassinations which were never investigated properly and<br>
remain unsolved.<br>
<p>
Not that it's difficult to explain why this odd situation has<br>
prevailed for so long. Britain has been run for most of this century<br>
by two intensely secretive, overlapping groups; one is the British<br>
state, about which we know almost nothing - especially its secret<br>
branches - about which even MPs are not allowed to ask questions. And<br>
the other is the Conservative Party, about which even its members<br>
know almost nothing of how it is run or who funds it. In the US,<br>
since the war, a group of government agencies, with their satellite<br>
supply companies, headed by the CIA and the Pentagon, have been<br>
operating largely in secret, and very profitably, too. God knows it's<br>
hard sometimes to show the links between ideology and interests, but<br>
in these instances it looks pretty straightforward to me. The most<br>
powerful interests in Britain and the US don't want their<br>
conspiratorial activities examined; and gee whiz, it turns out that<br>
being interested in conspiracies is intellectually forbidden in both<br>
societies.<br>
<p>
Of course there's one obvious exception to the official prohibition<br>
on interest in conspiracies. Since 1918 we have all been officially<br>
encouraged to believe in the existence of one conspiracy: the red<br>
menace. In Britain the most significant recent conspiracy theorists<br>
were the cold warriors, who pumped out endless theories of Soviet<br>
espionage and subversion in this country since the war. Mrs Thatcher<br>
was one of those. She looked at the Trades Union Congress - at Uncle<br>
Jack Jones, one of the nicest and most decent people who ever existed<br>
- and saw Moscow subversion. And to ensure that we believed in the<br>
reality of this approved conspiracy theory, the Anglo-American<br>
intelligence services, the outstanding example of institutionalised<br>
conspiracies in the twentieth century, have spent a ton of money -<br>
your money - propagating it, while denigrating anybody who turned up<br>
with any other kind of conspiracy. This hypocrisy reached some kind<br>
of peak in the late 1960s when the CIA - a vast world-wide conspiracy<br>
- put out a message to all its stations and personnel about the<br>
Kennedy Assassination. The instruction from Langley was that they<br>
were to use their political and media assets to put out the line that<br>
the kind of conspiracy described by the Warren Commission critics<br>
could not possibly exist!<br>
<p>
Four years before this comic event the CIA's relationship with the<br>
Warren Commission investigating JFK's assassination was handled by<br>
the late James Jesus Angleton, head of CIA counter-intelligence. He<br>
believed, among other things, that the split between the Soviet and<br>
Chinese communist parties (up to and including a shooting war on<br>
their borders) was a disinformation campaign to lull the west into a<br>
false sense of security. There are still people on the fringe of the<br>
UK-US intelligence services who believe the collapse of the Soviet<br>
empire in the last decade has been a deception operation.<br>
<p>
<p>
THE CONSPIRACIES WHICH ARE THE STATE<br>
<p>
My interest in conspiracies, not conspiracy theories, is political.<br>
As well as being a naive empiricist, I am also a naive democrat. I<br>
believe that the political process should be open, transparent. I<br>
don't like secrecy, and that means I don't like conspiracies. Be it<br>
the Trotskyist groups trying to enter the Labour Party; be it the<br>
foot soldiers of MI5 and Special Branch trying to conjure up a new<br>
enemy to keep themselves in work; be it companies bribing<br>
governments. And, yes, be it the Masonic networks in the police,<br>
local government, the state etc. The Masons are significant, though a<br>
Mason I met recently told me that their membership in Britain was<br>
falling; it's just that they don't - and never did - run the world.<br>
The important conspiracies we should be looking at are those run by<br>
the state - in this benighted country we might say the conspiracies<br>
which are the state.<br>
<p>
The garbage we are now getting so much of, the global conspiracy<br>
baloney, is simply background noise, a distraction. Anthony Summers,<br>
the British investigator and writer, summed up the position very<br>
well: he said he wasn't interested in conspiracy theories, but he was<br>
interested in theories about conspiracies.<br>
<p>
Six years ago I wrote a piece about this subject - I was thinking of<br>
Britain, not the US. We were then in the aftermath of three years of<br>
revelations of official conspiracies, generated by the 'Spycatcher'<br>
episode and the related revelations of Colin Wallace about the<br>
attempts by the British and American intelligence and security<br>
services to undermine the Wilson government. I concluded that piece<br>
thus:<br>
<p>
"As a concept `conspiracy' would be of little interest or explanatory<br>
value were it not for the defensive refusal of our chattering classes<br>
to acknowledge its legitimacy. We can only look forward to the day<br>
when the term has lost the connotations it has at the moment and<br>
rationality finally prevails. Meanwhile, with our eyes and ears open,<br>
we `naive empiricists' just have to get on with trying to understand<br>
the nature of political and historical reality."<br>
<p>
And I will be doing this long after the mass media have moved on from<br>
the X Files agenda of the moment to something else equally trivial.<br>
