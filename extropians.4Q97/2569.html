If you're in thermal equilibrium with a negentropy source, the amount of<br>
negentropy you can extract out of it depends on your free energy and its<br>
temperature. (Assuming the change in temperature as you dump energy into<br>
the source is negligible, the maximum amount of negentropy you can extract<br>
is F/T.) So while negentropy is what you ultimately care about, free<br>
energy is certainly a real resource.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "free energy costs more per unit entropy at<br>
low temperatures." Would you please explain?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Advanced civs would want to use black holes though, as they are by far the</i><br>

<p>
There is going to be a tradeoff between the number of bits of negentropy<br>
extracted per second and the energy expenditure per second. Plugging the<br>
black hole temperature and surface area formulas into Stefan-Boltzmann's<br>
Law, and assuming a complete shell around the black hole, we get<br>
(1.57e-60*M^2*Th^4 - 3.56e32/M^2) Joules per second net energy flow into<br>
the black hole, where M is the mass of the black hole in kilograms, and Th<br>
is the temperature of the shell in Kelvins. Divide this by k*Th*ln 2, we<br>
get the number of bits of negentropy extracted per second. With a solar<br>
mass black hole and a shell temperature of 1K, you'd be expending 6.2<br>
Watts and extracting 6.5e23 bits per second. With a Milky Way mass black<br>
hole and a shell temperature of 0.1K, you'd be expending 6.2e20 Watts and<br>
extracting 6.5e44 bits per second.<br>
<p>
Another problem with the idea is that if the universe turns out to be<br>
open, and these advanced civs have a sufficiently low discount rate for<br>
fresh bits, they would be better off hoarding their mass/energy<br>
until the universe gets cooler instead of turning them into black holes.<br>
