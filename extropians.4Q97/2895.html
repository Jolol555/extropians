OK, I just spent the past couple hours looking at various constitutions<br>
of the world.  I specifically concentrated on the US and Canadian ones,<br>
although I glanced at the French one, too.  The *fantastic* web page I<br>
found, that seems to include constitutions for all the nations that<br>
have them, is<br>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/law/home.html">http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/law/home.html</a><br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt; seems to be correct that the<br>
US and France are the only ones that have explicit references to<br>
phrases like "of the people, by the people, for the people".  (There<br>
may be other countries, but I only looked at those three mentioned<br>
above.)  However...<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;and in the fine print, you will always find a clause that</i><br>

<p>
Not true.  Although I acknowledge that the *origin* of the US<br>
constitution is based more on individual rights than the Canadian one,<br>
I can find no mention anywhere of those rights being withdraw-able by<br>
the government, or the monarchy, for any reason.  If you take the time<br>
to compare the US Bill of Rights, with the Canadian Charter of Rights<br>
and Freedoms, you'll see that they're very similar.  Furthermore, both<br>
of our countries inaugural documents contain references to God-given<br>
rights---Canadian, in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; US, in the<br>
Declaration of Independence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Any nation</i><br>
<i>&gt;that has this Natural Law "divine right of kings" clause is a nation</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the people are NOT free, they are merely being treated "extra</i><br>
<i>&gt;special" by the true power. Canada, which peacefully was granted</i><br>
<i>&gt;independence by the British monarchy, acknowledges that their government</i><br>
<i>&gt;exists by the grace and good will of the British crown.</i><br>
<p>
We certainly acknowledge that our independence was granted by the British,<br>
but we don't *exist* anymore due to that goodwill.  We are independent,<br>
just as you are.  We simply got our independence in different ways.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[In Britain] There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom of speech or any other officially recognised rights that belong</i><br>
<i>&gt;to or originate from the people.</i><br>
<p>
You're right, or so the Web document claims.  Canada is different.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Non-Americans just can't seem to understand how importatant this</i><br>
<i>&gt;prinicple is, nor do many americans today.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that rights granted "by the people, for the people" is a better<br>
principle to base a set of rights on than granted "by the king".  But...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;People think that if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;government observes a particular political right of the people as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter of form even though it is not legally bound to, that the people</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually, legally, posess this freedom. Not so.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  Even though the rights were granted under different<br>
conditions, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is just as<br>
much a legally binding document as the American Bill of Rights.<br>
There are plenty of cases where Canadians take the Canadian<br>
government to court for violations of our Constitution, and the<br>
people often win.  I think that's pretty strong evidence that<br>
our Constitution is just as legally binding as yours, even though <br>
they were originally derived in different ways.<br>
<p>
However, I'll restate what I've already stated previously: I agree that<br>
if the people are armed then it's more difficult for the government to<br>
install unpopular violations of freedom.  (And I'll also re-state that<br>
the cost of the right to bear arms seems to be increased violence in<br>
the society, although others have pointed out other possible cultural<br>
causes of the US's tendency towards violence.)<br>
<p>
rrandall6@juno.com (Randall R Randall) writes:<br>
<i>&gt;Without the right to bear arms, the rest of the rights are temporary, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be withdrawn at any time.</i><br>
<p>
They are not temporary; they are *potentially* temporary.  Serious<br>
violations of them would require the co-operation of the police and<br>
the military.  In Canada, for example, the military is significantly<br>
more independent from the goverment than in the US.  For example, the<br>
Prime Minister of Canada is *not* the Commander-in-Chief of the <br>
military.  When I was a cadet, I was taught that, with respect to<br>
internal affairs, one of the main directives of the Canadian military<br>
is to defend the constitution, including possible future violations of<br>
it by the government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As long as the citizens of a country are</i><br>
<i>&gt;militarily more powerful than the government, that government cannot step</i><br>
<i>&gt;too far out of line.</i><br>
<p>
That would be a good point if it were actually true in the US, but it<br>
isn't.  And besides, your Constitutional rights in the US are being<br>
eroded faster than you can keep track of them, despite your citizens<br>
being armed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are free only with another's permission, then you are not free at</i><br>
<i>&gt;all.</i><br>
<p>
I should mention here an important point: the Canadian Charter of<br>
Rights and Freedoms was produced in 1982, more than a century after our<br>
independence from Britain.  As such, it is a purely *Canadian*<br>
document, written by and for Canadians.  (I suppose it's a bit<br>
embarassing that it took us that long to create one, but that's a<br>
different story.)  Queen Elizabeth did signed it, but then-Prime-<br>
Minister Trudeau made it perfectly clear that it would go into effect<br>
with or without the Queen's signature.  Having her sign it was merely<br>
a polite gesture to the crown, nothing more.<br>
