I don't now what that means.  Current phylogenetic trees have all<br>
animals as one small branch of life.  The real evolutionary diversity is<br>
in the bacteria and archaea; animals are just rearrangements of masses<br>
of the animal eukaryotic cell.  <br>

Molluscs are different, yeah.  "In the microorganism camp", probably<br>
not.<br>
