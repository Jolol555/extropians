<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, most</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggressive acts are not violent acts.  Aggression has more to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; being determined to get one's way in the world than with harming or</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroying other sentient systems.  </i><br>
<p>
I would be more inclined to suggest that it is a mechanism through which<br>
tension, anger or frustration (or other emotions) may be easily released<br>
and coped with. I'm not so sure that aggression contains an element of<br>
intent, which seems to be what you are suggesting.<br>
<p>
Aggression may well be frequently used to achieve a desired result, but<br>
often it is just -there-, expressed, and then is gone. Consider someone<br>
muttering expletives under their breath, or an individual stamping their<br>
foot when something doesn't work properly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, as I see it, the problem is not aggression itself, which can be used</i><br>
<i>&gt; for extropic or entropic purposes, depending on the goals and beliefs of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the user of aggression.  The problem is when people believe that harming</i><br>
<i>&gt; or destroying others is an appropriate and effective way of accomplishing</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they want in the world.</i><br>
<p>
I think it is more a matter of how people express their aggression.<br>
Motivations and strategies are another problem, as I'm sure someone calmly<br>
and peacefully trying to achieve world domination would upset some people<br>
just as much as if a psychotic maniac were trying to do this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of our behaviors and beliefs are learned after we are born (although</i><br>
<i>&gt; our fundamental drives, like our sex drives and our nourishment drives</i><br>
<i>&gt; were learned through the long process of genetic evolution). </i><br>
<p>
And I think that aggression, also, is a product of evolution. But the way<br>
in which it is expressed, and also the motivations people have, are mostly<br>
acquired after birth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, the problem is that many people learn, mostly through observation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; others, that violence and threats of violence are somewhat effective ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; of getting others to do what they want them to.  This strategy works, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; some extent, so it is reinforced.  It also tends to cause the adrenal</i><br>
<i>&gt; glands to secrete adrenelin, which can be quite pleasant, so the behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt; is reinforced further.  However, the violence strategy is flawed in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; major ways.  The most obvious flaw is that it places the attacker in</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant danger to their own life and well-being, which conflicts with</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own internal drive for safety.</i><br>
<p>
This could be modified with proper victim-targetting strategies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It also tends to encourage others</i><br>
<i>&gt; to avoid them, thus conflicting with their drive for social acceptance. </i><br>
<p>
There are societies which value and accept violence, and a certain level of<br>
violence in certain individuals would result in an increase in their<br>
status.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since so many people are violent, how do the rest of us effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect ourselves from them?  I think that part of the basic training of</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans, along with communication skills, problem solving skills and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; such basic skills should include highly effective self-defence skills and</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies.  People should be trained to use their bodies effectively in</i><br>
<i>&gt; situations which require close, unarmed combat, and they should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; trained to effectively use weapons of all sorts, especially how to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary objects as weapons.  With everyone well-trained, violence would</i><br>
<i>&gt; no longer be a good solution, even in the short-term, since there would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be few potential victims, and the risk of trying violence would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; great, especially since any bystanders would be quite capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; apprehending you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A highly trained populace is probably the most effective way of stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sure there was a point where any given population lacked highly-trained<br>
individuals, at which point it was a matter of violence and natural<br>
abilities versus much the same.<br>
<p>
As far as I am aware class-based structures based on oppression (feudalism<br>
etc) rise up from such a society.<br>
<p>
I do agree with you, however, in that if an individual is highly-trained<br>
and capable of self-defense, this individual will suffer less violence and<br>
feel happier and more confident (I'm fairly well-trained, I'm glad I am, I<br>
haven't been injured in an assault in over 12 years). But if -everyone- is<br>
trained, then the training is of less value.<br>
