<p>
Can you blow up a group of people without blowing up any person within that<br>
group? People have rights. Groups are simply collections of people who have<br>
rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fact is, nobody has any</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights but the rights they claim and the rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; others agree they have, since rights are simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; an intellectual construct not existing in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective reality apart from the ability of </i><br>
<i>&gt; those that claim rights to enforce them. </i><br>
<p>
A right is a *just* claim. In order to be just, it must be both reciprocol<br>
and universal. There can be no reciprocol, universal rights without the<br>
right to consent (to that which would otherwise be aggression), which can<br>
only come from the Primethic Decision, i.e. an individual moral choice to<br>
the effect that proportionate defense against aggression is moral and<br>
aggression is immoral.<br>
<p>
A rights claim is, as you say, an intellectual construct, but it exists as<br>
such whether others agree or not. In fact, without the right to consent,<br>
agreement is meaningless. Might does not make rights. You are confusing the<br>
ability to enforce a claim with the claim itself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps you do not give rights to many </i><br>
<i>&gt; people, only one person at a time.</i><br>
<p>
Rights are not given; they are claimed. Privileges are given.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not sure I see the difference.</i><br>
<p>
Let's imagine that you are arrested (mistaken identity, of course), and<br>
locked up with a group of amorous cellmates. Will you bend over and submit<br>
to the will of the majority, or will you claim the *right* to defend<br>
yourself, even though you may, in fact lack the *ability* to effectively do<br>
so? Do your rights not exist because your cellmates disagree? Does the group<br>
have rights beyond those of its individual members?<br>
