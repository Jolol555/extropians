You're quite right. What I should have said was, "morality seems to favor<br>
species survival over individual survival." Individuals have been known to<br>
sacrifice themselves for others, progeny in particular.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;more a memetic phenomenon than a genetic one, although it's true</i><br>
<i>&gt;that these two domains are messily intertwingled with one</i><br>
<i>&gt;another.</i><br>
<p>
What I am talking about is the basis of morality, i.e. universal morality,<br>
not particular morals systems. I think we need a new word here. How about<br>
"primethic"?<br>
<p>
The Primethic Decision = a personal choice to the effect that proportionate<br>
defense against aggression is *moral* and aggressive behavior which elicits<br>
a defensive response is *immoral*.<br>
<p>
What do you think?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Genetic selection certainly happens at the individual level, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;the species or gene level... it is not actual genes that get weeded</i><br>
<i>&gt;out by natural selection, but individual zygotes, particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;combinations of genes.  It's only the additive effect of natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;selection upon us zygotes that results in modifications to the gene</i><br>
<i>&gt;pool.  That's why biological evolution is so much slower than</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultural evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At the memetic level, on the other hand, conscious selection can</i><br>
<i>&gt;be as fine-grained as we like.  I can consciously decide that X is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a bad idea, and discard it.  If I have trouble discarding it, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can start making fun of it, and encouraging my friends to joke</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it, and that often drives the demon out.</i><br>
<p>
The primethic decision may or may not be instinctive, but it does seem to be<br>
widespread, and I think, either way, it provides a solid foundation for a<br>
free (consensual) society.<br>
