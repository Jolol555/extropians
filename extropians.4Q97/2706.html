<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
A dream: take over all the media and any educational institution and<br>
flood "society" with good information that makes them more critical.<br>
More realistic: talk to as many people as you can. Doing that you can<br>
1) make a few (very few) actually change the way the think<br>
2) get better in achieving 1)<br>
3) make up your own mind about the things you talk about<br>
another possibility is writing articles, books, etc. (or creating<br>
computer games) that contain certain messages. Let the critical<br>
characters win, while the others fail.<br>
<p>
I've been thinking about this a lot (unfortunately, I didn't get to read<br>
a lot about it, yet). I believe that there are different "levels" to<br>
reach people:<br>
With some people, you can actually start a "philosophic" discussion.<br>
Unfortunately, some people - even if they understand the concept - won't<br>
change because they think that philosophy has nothing to do with real<br>
life. Others simply aren't interested in that kind of conversation, so<br>
either you tell them stories with a message (I recently found out that<br>
most communication among friends is about their experiences, things that<br>
happened to them recently - simply stress the "extropic aspects" in such<br>
conversation), or you "live as a good example". It makes a great<br>
difference, whether you tell people something, or if people ask you, why<br>
you are successful and happy and such a nice person ;-)<br>
<p>
Obviously, with these steps, you only reach a few people - but that's<br>
way better than reaching no one at all. If we are lucky, some people<br>
will have the idea of also spreading "good memes" which may result in a<br>
snowball effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To scare them? To lie to them? To tell them guns have demons in them that</i><br>
<i>&gt; make you kill people when you're pissed off in traffic?</i><br>
<p>
That's what (so-called) governments have been trying for millenia. It<br>
does work for some people, but I rather live among critical people who<br>
know why they're doing what (fear and misinformation are pretty unstable<br>
reasons).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or to tell the whole truth, and get people "evolved" (bad word:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "post-evolved" might be better) to a point where violent acts aren't their</i><br>
<i>&gt; first resort during a bad-hair day?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I favor the latter. That means getting everyone rich and calm, AND not</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to screw each other. Including not lying to each other.</i><br>
<p>
So far, I see the major problem in the addiction of some people to<br>
maintain power, while others prefer being ruled to being<br>
self-responsible. Those "power-addicts" would do anything just to keep<br>
their power (including the use of violence), while some of those who are<br>
ruled maybe develop aggression.<br>
<p>
Obviously, those in power ("governments", media, enterprises) usually<br>
won't try to get across messages who may result in self-responsible<br>
people who are critical about everything because that would destroy any<br>
centralized power. The only thing I believe I can do about this is<br>
become rich and powerful myself and "do a part of the job" (and I would<br>
never expect anybody else to do anything about it - if someone does, I'd<br>
appreciate it).<br>
<p>
later,<br>
