Meet the Transistor of the Future<br>
                     by Ilan Greenberg <br>

                     Things will get a lot faster in about 12 years. <br>
<p>
                     That's when computers and other digital devices will<br>
                     reap the rewards of Bell Laboratories' latest transistor<br>
                     advance. The research arm of Lucent Technologies<br>
                     published a report this week outlining its newest world<br>
                     record, a transistor that is four times smaller, five<br>
times<br>
                     faster, and draws 60 to 160 times less power than<br>
                     today's similar devices. <br>
<p>
                     While Bell Labs and others - most recently Toshiba in<br>
                     Japan - have built small transistors in the past, this<br>
                     latest advance in nanotechnology is the most<br>
                     promising new technology for building the kind of<br>
                     power-integrated circuits that boast many billions of<br>
                     transistors on a single silicon chip, as opposed to<br>
                     today's chips, which pack mere millions of transistors<br>
                     together. <br>
<p>
                     [...]<br>
<p>
                     While the achievement is an engineering milestone,<br>
                     many other advances must come together before this<br>
                     new transistor - which is only 182 atoms wide and<br>
                     boasts an insulation layer that is only three layers of<br>
                     atoms thick - appears in commercially available<br>
                     devices. <br>
