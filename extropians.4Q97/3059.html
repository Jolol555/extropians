Some of the most important sources of historical information are personal and<br>
institutional records made public only after the death of the authors.<br>
Effective personal immortality or even significantly lengthened personal<br>
lifespans might well restrict the availability of such resources for<br>
historians.  Given the obvious truth of Santayana's observation that those who<br>
are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it, any restriction on the<br>
availability of important historical resources should be of concern to us.<br>
<p>
The reasons for the relationship of personal death and the richness of the<br>
historical record are obvious.  Faced with their own imminent mortality,<br>
historical actors have usually been more candid in their own private writings<br>
than they were earlier in their lives.  (Of course, the self-serving nature of<br>
personal memoirs must always be taken into account, at whatever period of a<br>
person's life they were written.)  Knowing that they will not personally<br>
suffer the consequences of disclosure, people are willing to instruct their<br>
executors to make such private records public after a "decent interval", i.e.<br>
usually after such time has passed that all who were alive during the events<br>
recounted can be expected to have died.  Institutional custodians of records<br>
similarly often lose interest in the secrecy of information once those alive<br>
during a particular period have all died.  (Although the continuity of<br>
institutions past the lifespans of individual humans has tended to offset the<br>
"mortality-candor factor"; thus the significance of counter-examples, such as<br>
the capture and disclosure of essentially the entire corpus of Nazi records at<br>
the end of World War II.)  Finally, even if the author wishes to keep specific<br>
records secret indefinitely, short of destroying them before her death, once<br>
the author ceases to function, she simply can't stop the rummaging of<br>
historians.<br>
<p>
Because these factors will be significantly impacted by effective immortality,<br>
such a development seems bound to impoverish the future historical record.  An<br>
offsetting factor may be that posthuman beings will change so much across a<br>
long lifetime that they may lose interest in the secrecy of records from an<br>
earlier period in their life.  However, this factor would likely work on time-<br>
scales much longer than the current human "three score and ten" (or really,<br>
"four score" these days).  Furthermore, the "interpersonal privacy" factor<br>
mentioned above will become much more complex: Since one will be able to<br>
assume that most of the actors from a particular period in one's life are<br>
still alive and will continue to still be alive indefinitely, disclosure of<br>
information potentially embarrassing to one's associates or former associates<br>
will be more difficult.<br>
<p>
I wonder what other factors we might look to to offset the negative impact<br>
immortality may have on historiography?  What might the long-term effect of<br>
this restriction on the historical record be?<br>
