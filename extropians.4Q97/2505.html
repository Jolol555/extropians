About twelve years ago I had an experience which changed my entire<br>
perspective on gun ownership and self-protection.<br>
My wife and I were college students and we lived in a ground floor<br>
apartment.  Since it was Spring in Texas and quite pleasant outside, we<br>
had a living room window partly opened.  After a few hours of sleep, we<br>
were woken by the sound of<br>
rustling blinds.  Our cat had a habit of climbing up into the windowsill<br>
and banging the blinds and my wife would get up and the raise the blinds<br>
out of the cat's way.  Usually, I would fall back to sleep before my<br>
wife got back in bed.  But, this time the sound had a different quality<br>
to it.  So, I remained awake.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the living room, my wife let out a loud, horrific scream.  It was</i><br>
utterly primeval.  I immediately jumped out of bed and ran into the<br>
room.  My adrenaline was pumping to the point I thought my heart was<br>
going to explode; I was ready to fight with tooth and nail.  Next to the<br>
window I found my wife shivering with fright.<br>
<p>
In a sleepy state and expecting to find our cat, she had walked up to<br>
the window.  Instead, she discovered a man half-way through the window. <br>
Upon her scream and my imminent arrival, he ran away.  But not before he<br>
whispered sometime to her.  To this day, my wife's memory still blocks<br>
what he said.<br>
<p>
After a few minutes, I stopped hyper-ventilating and called the police. <br>
They arrived, looked around, took some notes, waited until we were<br>
somewhat calm, and left.  There wasn't much more they could do.<br>
<p>
So, my wife and I laughed if off thinking the "burglar" would have been<br>
quite disappointed with our paltry student belongings.<br>
<p>
The next Monday I came back from class to find my wife ashened and<br>
sitting on the couch in a stunned state.  She had just gotten off the<br>
phone with the detective who was following up on the case.<br>
<p>
Apparently, it was not a burglar.  They come during the day.  Nope, this<br>
fellow was what the detective called a home invader and he was not there<br>
to steal.  The detective was very, very interested in what he had<br>
whispered to my wife before running away.  But, she could not, or would<br>
not recall.  The detective told my wife she was very lucky that she was<br>
not alone.<br>
<p>
In that instance I realized that personal protection via a police force<br>
was at most a partial illusion.  I realized I had no means, except a<br>
kitchen knife, to protect myself and my loved ones.  I, also, realized<br>
that I would never, never be in that situation again.  I now own a<br>
street-legal short-barreled shotgun.<br>
<p>
People are kidding themselves if they believe they can delegate their<br>
self-protection to a police force.  I am sorry.  But we, as a society,<br>
have not, yet, reached the point where we do not need to assume<br>
responsibility for the protection of ourselves and our families.  To<br>
think otherwise is dangerous.  I wish it were false.<br>
<p>
The jungle is still full of lions, tigers, and bears.<br>
