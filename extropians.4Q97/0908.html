I've been off the list for a couple of months while I finished a project.<br>
It's nice to be back.<br>
<p>
Life magazine recently published a "millenium special issue", reviewing the<br>
events of the past millenium in the picture-laden non-intellectual way for<br>
which they have become famous.  The last page of the magazine contains a<br>
1500-word essay speculating on the events of the next millenium.  Its main<br>
topic is the imminent arrival of superintelligence and the resulting<br>
displacement of the unmodified human from the position of Top Creature.<br>
Isn't it neat how Extropian memes are reaching the great American public,<br>
even if in fairly dilute form?  Among those quoted in the article are Paul<br>
Horn, the senior VP of research at IBM, Vernor Vinge, who first publicised<br>
the Singularity, and myself, whose cousin wrote the article.  <br>
<p>
My cousin, Chuck Hirshberg, called me first, because he knew I was into<br>
"that future stuff".  I hit him with, in rapid succession, the Singularity,<br>
nanotech, and the technological modification of human nature.  He would<br>
have liked to include the last two in his article, but there wasn't room,<br>
and they were relatively less spectacular.<br>
<p>
My cousin called Horn as a reality check, to make sure this Singularity<br>
thing wasn't just some wacky thing I dreamed up.  According to my cousin,<br>
Horn basically agreed with me.  I was fairly surprised that Horn was so<br>
receptive to the concept.  He is in a position of some authority, and I<br>
would have thought the establishment more resistant to notions that might<br>
so thoroughly dis-establish it.<br>
