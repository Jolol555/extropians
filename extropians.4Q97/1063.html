I read in The Times newspaper yesterday that a researcher had managed <br>
to transplant monkey heads and keep them alive for up to a week after <br>
the operation. We have discussed the possibility of  brain <br>
transplantation at some point on the extropian or the transhumanist <br>
list, and we concluded that it seemed unlikely (at least before the <br>
arrival of nanotech, at which time there wouldn't be any use in <br>
transplanting heads anyway). The reason we thought the project looked <br>
hopeless was that the task of making the nerve fibers in the spinal <br>
core match up correctly after the transplantation looks absolutely <br>
staggering.<br>
<p>
What we overlooked was the these nerves don't need to be matched up <br>
in a certain way or even reconnected at all! What the researcher I <br>
read about had done was to keep the brain stem of the donor body. <br>
This makes the donor body continue such functions as respiration, <br>
heart activity and digestion, thereby supplying the transplanted head <br>
with oxygen and nutrients. The transplanted brain has control over <br>
the facial muscles and would thus be able to read, eat, and in some <br>
way or another communicate. But it has no connection with the brain <br>
stem or the rest of the body, so the animal is 90% paralysed.<br>
<p>
To me it seems unnecessary to have a donor body: might it not be <br>
possible to replace it with a heart-lung machine?<br>
<p>
I don't think that this breakthough will have any major practical <br>
consequences, but it represents yet another development that forces <br>
people to come to terms with the weirdness of the future and of the <br>
present day. Perhaps the shock value of head transplants will help <br>
desensitize people so they become more accepting of, say, the idea of <br>
cloning?<br>
