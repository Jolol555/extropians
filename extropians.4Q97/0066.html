This evening I finally got hold of a copy of Damien Broderick's<br>
_The Spike_ outside of the confines of a bookstore. I'm pleased <br>
with the breadth of its coverage of transhumanist ideas. I'm also<br>
glad that something has been written about the online &gt;H culture <br>
of '96-'97, something beyond the web essays and list archives<br>
that will no doubt remain suspended in cyberspace. The book has<br>
some of the feel, for me, that being a participant online has had;<br>
and I think the feel of things "here" will change as transhumanism <br>
obtains a higher profile, and as new concepts of the future emerge.<br>
Anyway, I enjoyed it.<br>
<p>
Since my US trip, I've become much more involved with nanotech -<br>
I studied _Nanosystems_ while riding the Greyhound buses out to<br>
Dallas and Zyvex, and I formed the conclusion that it should<br>
be incredibly easy to put together complete assembler designs<br>
(at the component-level, not the atomic-level) from what's in <br>
that book. Since my return to Australia, I found a web paper by <br>
Ralph Merkle specifying, so he claims, a set of molecular tools <br>
capable of synthesizing "all the rigid hydrocarbons", which would <br>
include any customized diamond shape (diamond*oid* might involve<br>
elements other than carbon and hydrogen, but pure diamond seems<br>
enough to realize the whole gamut of nanomechanical devices).<br>
Also since my return, Zyvex have finally obtained the atomic <br>
probes that they were waiting for when I visited, so they've <br>
started the real lab work.<br>
<p>
All in all, nanotech looks extremely close to me. And the arrival <br>
of MNT, I think, would invalidate the Moore's-Law type of projection<br>
which places Singularity in 2035 or 2025, since Moore's Law<br>
is ultimately based on the rate of improvement of semiconductor<br>
technology. Nanotech rod logic would provide capabilities equal to<br>
those which a Moore's-Law projection might predict for<br>
the late 2010s. But I can imagine a Merkle-type "hydrocarbon<br>
assembler", using buckytubes for the bodies of the molecular tools,<br>
being made by 2005 or even by 2000.<br>
                                   <br>
So I'm spending a little time trying to be a good Yudkowskian<br>
Singularitarian, aiming for Singularity now by doing my part<br>
to hasten a complete assembler design, and spending a little<br>
time wondering about the wisdom of hastening the arrival of a<br>
technology which would allow one to make a planet-killing device<br>
smaller than a bacterium - *especially* about the wisdom of<br>
working on it in a public-domain collaboration (like <br>
<a href="http://nanocomputer.org">http://nanocomputer.org</a>). <br>
<p>
And I'm spending a little time on scenario generation. An example:<br>
<p>
After the first assemblers built, there is indeed a<br>
period of time in which "everything goes haywire": First<br>
politically and psychologically haywire, as the powers that be all<br>
seek a stake, and as the sort of ideas discussed in _Engines<br>
of Creation_ are in the news media every day, accompanying<br>
the latest reports on nanotechnological progress. Then<br>
physically and economically haywire, as matter compilers spread<br>
throgh society and nanomachines become part of our physical<br>
environment (e.g. in the form of grey goo and countermeasures!). <br>
We might see traffic into space increase by orders of magnitude <br>
and a vast increase in the depth and breadth of net connectivity<br>
(imagine everyone on Earth being handed overnight a connection <br>
to Neal Stephenson's Metaverse *and* the tools with<br>
which to add to it). If most people quit their jobs, cities<br>
everywhere could end up looking like "Burning Man"-style anarchy.<br>
This might all take months or just weeks.<br>
<p>
On the human timescale, I think the "haywire period" would<br>
end with a bang, namely with whatever the first fast minds of<br>
"approximately human level" do. I favor the view that they<br>
would intervene along the lines of David Pearce's hedonistic<br>
imperative, while building a "stairway to heaven" whereby<br>
slower entities can take steps into a transhuman existence;<br>
meanwhile, their own accelerated evolution would have made<br>
them worthy of the name Powers, and everything that really<br>
interested them would be taking place in a region reserved<br>
for their own, possibly eternal, future evolution. At least,<br>
all this happens if they don't make a Big Mistake first. <br>
<p>
I feel on much shakier ground speculating about this future <br>
of accelerated superintelligences, than I do when spinning a <br>
nano scenario.<br>
