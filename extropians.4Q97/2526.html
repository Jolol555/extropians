I submit for comment the following.  I know some of this is probably<br>
covered elsewhere, but I just wanted to get this out in case it isn't.<br>
<p>
cp = cryoprotectant<br>
<p>
Tests:<br>
	Protein:  Anders mentioned some proteins denature.  I'm not<br>
sure if this is because of low temperatures, interaction with cps or<br>
some other process(es).  If it is the second, one would expect a good<br>
cp not to do this.  (Or perhaps not: maybe some damage does not<br>
matter than much.  This needs to be evaluated.)<br>
	Other biomolecules:  DNA, RNA, chlorestorol, lipids, can be<br>
tested too to assess effects and damage of cps.  Together with protein<br>
tests, a damage marker shoudl be sought so as to reduce the number<br>
of initial tests.<br>
	Nerve connections:  Anders brought up a good point of sacrificing<br>
axons for synapses or vice versa.  However, it remains to be seen if any<br>
cps do more damage to one or the other and whether there is a trade<br>
off involved.<br>
	Nerve revival:  Aside from examining damage to nerve <br>
connections, reviving nerve cells and networks of such to operational<br>
condition should be a test too.  (The ultimate test being full revival<br>
of a brain, but that would be far off into the future.)<br>
	Cellular damage:  Other cells should be examined too.  This<br>
might result in finding a cell type marker.  Perhaps some type of cell<br>
is easier to work with in a lab setting and can be used in the stead of<br>
nerve cells for initial tests.<br>
<p>
Measures:<br>
	Need for both quantitative and qualitative measures.<br>
	Ex. quantitative: percentage of protein in solution denatured.<br>
	Ex. qualitative: types of protein damage, such as crosslinking<br>
		versus breakdown.<br>
<p>
Other:<br>
	Note tolerance level to cp.<br>
		Does it cause any damage?<br>
	More than one cp?<br>
		Is a cp "cocktail" better than one cp?<br>
		Perhaps different cps should be used for different <br>
			tissues?<br>
		Perhaps different cps should be used at at different <br>
			times in the process?<br>
	Storage/maintenance/costs:<br>
		Is the cp easy to store and maintain before use?<br>
		Is it easy to manufacture?<br>
		What is its long term optimal working temperature?<br>
<p>
Related issue:<br>
	Design of "home" cryonics kit for use in emergency situations.<br>
		(This involves messy legal issues, but the design of<br>
		one might lead to a wider acceptance of cryonics by<br>
		making it a fait accompli.)<br>

P.S.:  Where can I subscribe to any cryonics lists?<br>
