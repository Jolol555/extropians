<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
While the Y2K factor could be a contributing factor, I think that the<br>
biggest factor in this already happened in 1990: The end of the cold<br>
war. <br>
<p>
After sitting back and reflecting on my own anti-authority and<br>
anti-government beliefs/opinions, etc., after growing up as a redneck<br>
Reagan republican, progovt to the core, I would have to say that I think<br>
that during the Cold war, we Americans, in our anti-communist fervor and<br>
armageddon fears, were quite willing to put up with government violating<br>
our rights on occasion so long as is was "In the National Interest" for<br>
"The Interest of National Security" etc. etc. Our tradition of<br>
volunteerism and community spirit served to adhere us to loyally support<br>
the government, even when we had to bite it, kind of like how the blacks<br>
loyally served in the US military in the hopes that things would be<br>
different "after the war".<br>
<p>
Now that there is no obvious or publicly proclaimed enemy, many people<br>
are not willing to being stomped on by the government bureaucracy for no<br>
good reason, so they question, they resist, they tell bureaucrats to go<br>
to hell and get off their land, and some back such resistance up with<br>
violent action when the government seems to just not get the hint, or<br>
seems to some to vastly overstep its authority without any reasonable<br>
justification. Given that there is no clear and present danger to<br>
national security, many people think that the 9th and 10th amendments<br>
give them the right to resist in any manner within the Constitution<br>
(which does, contrary to liberal popular belief, support the idea of<br>
armed rebellion against a tyrranical government, just read the preamble<br>
for god's sakes).<br>
<p>
Where does this leave us? Well, the government has yet to get it through<br>
its thick skull that the world has changed, that it can no longer be the<br>
big bully it has been for a large part of this century. Because of this,<br>
everytime a citizen gets up and stands on his or her rights, and backs<br>
them up with personal force, the government treats that person like an<br>
enemy of the people that either needs to be reeducated or destroyed.<br>
THis is creating a vicious cycle of resistance and repression that<br>
replicates the sort of practices advocated by revolutionary manuals read<br>
by leftist terrorists and guerrillas around the world. The object of<br>
such practices is to advocate repressive policies. THis ticks off a<br>
small, nutty percentage of the population, which actively resists and is<br>
widely publicized by the government media organs to justify the<br>
enactment of even more repressive policies, which causes more<br>
resistance, and so on and so on until you are left with either a fascist<br>
government, or civil war.<br>
<p>
Government cannot help itself in this system, it is built to protect<br>
itself, discourage competition, and perpetuate and grow its power and<br>
reach. It is an unintelligent collection of self perpetuating memes, and<br>
unless a leader able to inspire enlightened thought is able to wake the<br>
electorate up as to the cycle that is being bred, this cycle will<br>
degenerate to chaos or darkness. This is the difficult thing, for such<br>
individuals through history have typically been corrupted by power just<br>
enough to take advantage of the situation to attain empire. We are in a<br>
post republican death spiral, that will either end in corporate<br>
dissolution, corrupt transformation to empirical fascism, or enlightened<br>
transformation into a state the likes of which has yet to be seen in<br>
history.<br>
