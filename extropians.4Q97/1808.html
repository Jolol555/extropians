<p>
As things are going right now, I would not be the least surprised if<br>
the Singularity affects a minority of all humans, the rest living<br>
relatively normal lives in the shadow of Powers simply because they<br>
couldn't adapt fast enough, didn't see what was coming, didn't care,<br>
didn't have the money or just refused (there are a lot of people who<br>
think our visions are actually horrible, remember that). Exponential<br>
growth makes differences grow exponentially too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Won't there be some "magical" point of no return...</i><br>
<i>&gt; You smart and won't do harm anymore.</i><br>
<i>&gt; or your dumb, and can't do any harm................</i><br>
<p>
Maybe, but my point still stands: we cannot be sure about this, and we<br>
definitely should *not* rely on it. It is a very dangerous Polyanna<br>
mentality.<br>
<p>
Besides, this point may be at a very high power level, and we already<br>
know that individuals with defective ethics (not to mention accidents)<br>
can hurt a lot of people fairly easily, and as the power level<br>
increases, the range of effects can be much larger. So while the IQ<br>
5000 posthumans are utterly benign, the IQ 500 transhumans can be<br>
somewhat nasty - and we have to pass that stage safely first.<br>
<p>
What I want is to find a way to guarantee my, and hopefully others',<br>
survival in the face of this uncertainty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also: so earth goes........who cares....</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not that we don't have any ball's left ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I asked you this before: Anders you have to leave your cradle</i><br>
<i>&gt; someday :-). What's so damn special about earth, except for </i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact that we live on it :-)</i><br>
<p>
Sentimentality. Besides, I'm a packrat who hates throwing away any<br>
information that can someday be useful.<br>
