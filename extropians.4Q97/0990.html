FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
<p>
In an attempt to open the space frontier to private human activity, <br>
and to destroy the myth that space is owned by any government or <br>
any government agency, two international space organizations will <br>
announce a $250,000 "Cheap Access to Space" (CATS) Prize on <br>
November 7th at "Space Frontier Conference VI" in Los Angeles.<br>
<p>
The conference, with the theme "Space: Open for Business", will be<br>
held at the Los Angeles Sheraton Gateway Hotel from November 7-9,<br>
1997.  A central topic will be the transformation of space from a <br>
government program to a real frontier driven by commercial <br>
development. The conference will feature frank discussions about <br>
privatizing the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.<br>
There will also be presentations on new commercial markets, such as<br>
the emerging space tourism industry, recent plans to privately capture<br>
and mine asteroids, and proposals to use space solar power to<br>
compete with today's coal and nuclear energy systems.<br>
<p>
The formal announcement of the $250,000 CATS prize will be made<br>
at a press conference and reception on Friday, November 7 at 7 pm.<br>
The prize will be awarded to the first private team to launch a 2 <br>
kilogram payload to an altitude of 200 km or greater.  Conference<br>
attendees and members of the press may attend the reception.  The<br>
rules for the competition, and other details, will be announced at<br>
this time.<br>
<p>
The Space Frontier Foundation, an international space policy and<br>
media organization, will manage the competition and is holding <br>
the prize which has been funded by the Foundation for the <br>
International Non-Governmental Development of Space (FINDS),<br>
a private 7 million dollar endowment.  "Governments don't open <br>
frontiers, people do" stated Foundation President and FINDS<br>
Executive Director Rick N. Tumlinson. "Prizes have been used<br>
throughout history to foster innovation in the private sector.  From<br>
the age of exploration to Lindberg they have inspired imaginations<br>
and helped knock down barriers."<br>
<p>
A special all-day session on Friday, November 7, sponsored by the<br>
U.S. Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, will focus on radical<br>
innovations in spaceplane technologies and services being offered<br>
by the new generation of entrepreneurial rocket companies.  The<br>
conference is being co-sponsored by the ProSpace, the "Citizen's<br>
Space Lobby."<br>
<p>
Guest speakers will include such notables as former astronauts<br>
turned entrepreneurs "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11), Charles "Pete"<br>
Conrad (Apollo 12) and Dr. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17), Mars<br>
advocate and author Dr. Robert Zubrin, asteroid resources expert<br>
Dr. John Lewis (University of Arizona), world-renowned robot<br>
builder Red Whitaker (Carnegie Mellon University), NASA's<br>
John Mankins (NASA/HQ), and former congresswoman Andrea<br>
Seastrand.<br>
<p>
"Whether you are an investor, an entrepreneur, a space reporter, or<br>
working on a movie about our future, this is the one place to be this<br>
year," advises Tumlinson, who has testified multiple times before<br>
Congress on space commercialization issues. "It's like the day<br>
before the computer revolution. This stuff is real, it's beginning<br>
right now, and it will soon change our civilization forever."<br>
<p>
The Space Frontier Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that<br>
has been fighting since 1988 to change how we all think about,<br>
and attempt to open, the space frontier. Our goal is the near term and<br>
irreversible expansion of the human race into space, and the<br>
permanent settlement of the high frontier.<br>
<p>
Registration for this 3-day conference is $90, or $70 for students.<br>
Registration will open at 8 a.m. on Friday, November 7th.  The<br>
Sheraton Gateway Hotel is located at 6101 West Century Boulevard<br>
near Los Angeles International Airport (310-642-1111).<br>
