I've seen a similar phenomenon myself.  I used to have a roommate who<br>
seemed to attract trouble without actually inviting it, getting into fights<br>
at bars and clubs about every other weekend.  In most cases, a complete<br>
stranger would "step up" with no provocation and try to start something.  I<br>
think it was something of an alpha-male type thing; my roomate was 6'2",<br>
250 lbs of solid muscle, and a fairly good looking guy.  Fortunately for<br>
him, he could flatten 3 of his average aggressors at the same time without<br>
breaking a sweat.  The times that I was with him I hardly ever helped him<br>
because he never seemed to need any.<br>
<p>
The *real* story to this, though, is what happened afterward.  Half the<br>
time, the police would show up (late, of course) and throw *him* in jail<br>
for assaulting the 3 or 4 guys who would be laid out in the parking lot by<br>
this time.  Because of his size, the police didn't consider it<br>
self-defense, even though he was usually outnumbered and the victim.  On<br>
one particular occasion when I was with him, the police showed up ten<br>
minutes after it was over and proceeded to use pepper spray and clubs on my<br>
roommate even though he was no longer fighting his aggressors and was<br>
attempting to cooperate with the police (at which point I nearly got myself<br>
taken with him).<br>
<p>
Note: After this happened for the third time in about 2 months, a<br>
successful legal action/investigation was taken against the San Jose police<br>
regarding some of these incidents and all of the charges (resisting arrest,<br>
assault, et al.) were dropped and two of the officers involved received<br>
official reprimands, if I remember correctly.  It is fairly obvious that<br>
the police did not believe him to be of the socio-economic class that would<br>
have a good lawyer.<br>
