If you stand in a wormhole, you are in a certain (very weird) place,<br>
possibly with parts sticking out at the "entrance" and "exit". There<br>
is no real paradox here, you are in one place at a time (or strictly<br>
speaking a locally connected volume of places).<br>
<p>
The "non-existent" gap cannot be entered, since by definition it does<br>
not exist. But there is a "throat" in the wormhole, where it is most<br>
narrow; in a spherically symmetric wormhole this is a spherical<br>
region. From the outside, a wormhole in space would look like a<br>
distortion of the stars behind it, with a distorted ball of stars in<br>
the center (they are stars seen through the wormhole throat). If you<br>
move through it, you will see the star-ball in front of you expand,<br>
until it fills half of your sky and the more and more distorted<br>
universe behind you fills the other half; you will also see a<br>
distorted "reflection" of yourself along the seam between the<br>
starfields created as light rays from you circumnavigate the<br>
throat. As you emerge, the starfield in front of you will become less<br>
distorted, and the stars of the place you left will become a ball<br>
inside the other wormhole distortions. In a small wormhole this<br>
transition is of course very quick.<br>
<p>
I really wish I could draw it, but email currently doesn't support the<br>
kind of multimedia I would like (imagine being able to create<br>
"applets" showing how you visualize a certain phenomenon!).<br>
<p>
At no point in the traversal have you left spacetime, you have just<br>
moved through a more exotic region than we are used to. It is possible<br>
to get from point A to point B faster than a straight light ray by<br>
taking a wormhole shortcut, but at no place is there a violation of<br>
the lightspeed limit locally.<br>
