<p>
Some linguists who study writing systems call the Semitic scripts<br>
"abjads".  In Semitic languages, words inflect around not a root but a<br>
series of consonants; if you understand the context, you will know which<br>
vowels apply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the true alphabet was actually invented by some Greek(s) who adopted the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Semitic symbols, realized that none of them coded for vowels, fixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, and thus accidentally created a phonemic alphabet whereas left to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own devices they'd probably have created a syllabary.</i><br>
<p>
They already had (Linear B), and lost it with the collapse of Mycenaean<br>
civilization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; letters.  We could use a few more, but still fewer than 50.  Syllabaries</i><br>
<i>&gt; often have 50-75 symbols, meaning their language is restricted to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; many syllables.</i><br>
<p>
Syllabaries are generally best for languages where the typical syllable is<br>
one consonant and one vowel or just one vowel.  Languages like English or<br>
German, where syllables can be CCCVCC (streets), are a little harder to<br>
transcribe without a godawful number of characters.<br>
<p>
Some syllabaries fit their languages very well, such as Japanese and<br>
Cherokee.  Others don't fit so well, like the Mayan languages and<br>
Mycenaean Greek.  Writers in these scripts had various kludges to get by.<br>
The Mycenaeans just ignored the consonants on the end of a syllable, so a<br>
word like Agamemnon might be written A-GA-ME-NO.  The Mayans covered the<br>
end consonants by treating them as the beginning of a second syllable, one<br>
with a silent vowel, generally the same vowel as the real syllable.  A<br>
word like 'kutz' might be written KU-TZ(u).<br>
<p>
The best English text dealing with writing systems is _The World's Writing<br>
Systems_, by Oxford Press, 1996, edited by Peter Daniels and (somebody)<br>
WIlliams.<br>
