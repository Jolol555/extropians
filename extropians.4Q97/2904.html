<p>
That's exactly the question.  ARE the aggregate external costs <br>
greater than the aggregate external benefits?<br>
<p>
The early evidence says not.<br>
<p>
For example, a randomly-selected American is -- even according to the <br>
most anti-gun of the credible studies -- many times more likely to <br>
use a gun in a successful defense against a crime, than to be injured <br>
by a gun.<br>
<p>
But this apparently contrafactual hypothesis is the basis for your <br>
entire argument.<br>
