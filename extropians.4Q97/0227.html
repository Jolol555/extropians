<i>&gt; The development mentioned in prediction one arguably happened in 1997</i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://www.chess.ibm.com/">http://www.chess.ibm.com/</a>). Of course, the match was not for the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; chess championship as recognized by a major chess organization, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kasparov is widely recognized as the best human chess player.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This event took 39 years after 1958 instead of ten.</i><br>
<p>
I think we'll have to wait another few years to claim this prize.<br>
Kasparov is in fact the FIDE recognized world champion, but Deep Blue<br>
would probably not have made it through the preliminary rounds of<br>
the world championship challenge procedure, because it was written<br>
specifically to beat Kasparov; it was tuned to his style, and learned<br>
from his matches.  It would certainly do well in general competition,<br>
but it would probably lose to someone with a very different style of<br>
play from Kasparov's, like Mikhail Tal or Vasily Smyslov.<br>
