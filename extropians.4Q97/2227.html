<i>&gt; &gt;  (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know. Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same. Someone on the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but can't tell whether it's something solid or just a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't think wondering what we're doing to our atmosphere is the <br>
truly relevant question here -- it is probably either no big deal or <br>
way too late.  The important thing that no one is addressing is that <br>
the fossil fuels we are burning represent the end result of millions <br>
of years of solar energy concentrated into these highly energetic <br>
substances.  I don't think anyone will argue that we are burning this <br>
stuff at an extremely accelerated rate, and the fact is, when <br>
they are gone, that is it.  I happen to believe they might be <br>
important, and I would rather not run out of them any time soon.  <br>
It's not so much about the atmosphere, but rather how limited a <br>
resource they represent.  I think fossil fuels have better uses than <br>
being inefficiently combusted when I commute to work.<br>
