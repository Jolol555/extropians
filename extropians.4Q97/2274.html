<i>&gt;I've always wondered if people that favored electric cars so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;realize how toxic batteries are, and that the electric plant burns </i><br>
<i>&gt;coal to generate the electricity to power them.</i><br>
<p>
This statement could not be more true.  However, one has to speculate <br>
as to where battery technology would be today if companies had spent <br>
even one percent of the money they have spent on improving IC engines <br>
or oilfield techniques.  Likewise on solar power.  No one <br>
will argue that electric motors are far better at converting <br>
electricity into kinetic energy than IC engines are at converting <br>
gasoline into KE. (I wouldn't mind having a 75KW motor on each <br>
wheel.)<br>
  I truly don't think it is a matter of expense, but one of <br>
inertia.  Manufacturing electric motors is far cheaper than the <br>
complex IC engines they have today, and solar cells wouldn't be so <br>
expensive in mass production.  Humanity has a habit of not budging <br>
the status quo until life really starts to stink.  Pain and fear are <br>
great motivators.  Oh well.<br>
