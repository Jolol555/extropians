<i>&gt;&gt; Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; digestive system and the liver to be assimulated properly. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1)What nutrients need what parts?</i><br>
<p>
Too detailed to go into here, but clearly proteins must be broken <br>
apart into amino acids or short peptides, many vitamins and nutrients<br>
have active transport mechanisms form the intestines, the liver does<br>
essential modification of many vitamins and nutrients eg changing EFA's<br>
into triglycerides.<br>
Read the nutrition and metabolism book which I suggested in my other<br>
message.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)The intestines perform a function.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If that function can be quantified and reproduced externally that is what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;want.</i><br>
<p>
I see where you are coming from (and trying to get to). I like the idea.<br>
The problem is that the body is far too complicated physiologically and<br>
biochemically, and our understanding is far too limited, for anything like<br>
what you want to be possible for decades to come.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I prefer feeding to take as little time as possible.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. That's why I now do most of my feeding by drinking blended food<br>
"slurries". The blender 'chewing' the food saves me time and effort.<br>
Occassionally, I still chew because I like chewing and its good for my teeth<br>
and gums which I don't want to atrophy (just yet :).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I would rather everything be predigested </i><br>
<i>&gt;so I don't have to walk around waiting for my cells to be fed.</i><br>
<p>
The predigested part is not so easy. I believe there are healthy and<br>
nutritional benefits of passing food throught the digestive system which<br>
cannot easily be gained any other way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a dangerous and impossible long term practice and would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; extremely foolish to initiate voluntarily. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think about LONGevity.</i><br>
<p>
Me too. All the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am trying to avoid using as many body parts as I can.</i><br>
<p>
Then there are easier ones to avoid using than the whole digestive<br>
system.<br>
<p>
How about having your arms and legs amputated? (Maybe leave your<br>
right arm so you can type - or maybe not with good voice recognition)<br>
There is evidence that shorter people live longer. It might be true<br>
the a happy arm/leg amputee who gets his exercise by rolling around<br>
and squirming on the floor might live longer too. :) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That way when I have to start replacing parts I can save $. :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;If food was processed( broken into componant parts and sterilized) </i><br>
<i>&gt;before eaten many parts of the digestive system become unnessasary, </i><br>
<i>&gt;such as the teeth, tongue, saliva, esophagus, stomach, stomach acids </i><br>
<i>&gt;which serve only to make bits of food smaller and more pure.</i><br>
<p>
Not just smaller, other imporant functions. Anyway some of the parts<br>
you have listed do not wear our early or are not terminal if they do.<br>
I don't believe that anyone has ever died from a wornout tongue or had<br>
a tongue transplant for that matter. :)<br>
<p>
Also tongues can be very useful for lots of fun things.<br>
I wouldn't want to be without one. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I once thought that too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then I started reseaching oxygen therapy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many sources said otherwise.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but it is only for certain specialized *diseased* things and even<br>
then still mostly unproven.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;High O means low pulse/respiration, which means those parts last longer.</i><br>
<p>
I you breathed up to a 50% oxygen mixture, the amount of oxygen in the<br>
blood would only increase a little (the disolved %) since most of it is<br>
in the "hypersaturated" (actively bound) hemoglobin. Your pluse rate<br>
would change very little. It is true that your would need to breathe less<br>
than half as frequently or deeply, however. But the cumulative long-term<br>
damage on the lung tissue of the extra oxygen would probably negate any<br>
benefit.<br>
<p>
The big point here, Mike, is that "good old Mother Nature" has pretty<br>
well optimised us already.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A laudable goal, but how do you implement it without exercise?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Replace those muscles with machines.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is already being done with today's technology.</i><br>
<p>
Eventually, I agree. But we are nowhere near the "bionic man" yet.<br>
Easier to try the amputee route mentioned above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Movement means free-radicals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So does eating,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am trying to make eating easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Solid foods tax the jaw and stomach muscles.</i><br>
<p>
Use slurries as described above. (They also make taking &gt;100 nutrient<br>
pills per day a breeze!) I expect they also make it easier on the<br>
stomach although the acid requirements will not be changed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;breathing</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More O = low respiration rate.</i><br>
<p>
answered before<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or I could get better lungs( transplants, biotech implants, bionics).</i><br>
<p>
Not for a long time yet. Our natural ones a pretty damned good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;and being alive. Free-radicals are both</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; harmful and necessary for life at the same time. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do not belive they will ALWAYS be necessary.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, they will be. They are generated by the mitochondrial production<br>
of ATP in every cell (including your precious brain). All that we can<br>
do is *control* them, not eliminate them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It's where they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are formed and how they are dealt with that is important.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Absolutely!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, I have had trouble finding ways to protect my my brain,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is the only organ I REALLY care about right now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;My body is life support for my brain.</i><br>
<p>
So you aiming for "Donovan's Brain" (an old sci-fi flick).<br>
<p>
You can best proctect your brain by first all the same things as will<br>
protect the rest of your body - your brain is *fundamentally* similar<br>
cells after all. Then you go after a lot of the "smart drugs" things<br>
which are especially brain protective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free radicals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In the right places and at the right times, they are part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; metabolic processes of life.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3)Would you mind pointing out those places and times </i><br>
<i>&gt;so I can begin thinking about how to make them better?</i><br>
<p>
Done a bit above. Read a good biochemistry book. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would rather live without uncontrolled atoms smashing through my DNA.</i><br>
<p>
The area to concentrate on most, IMO is the mitochondria, where there are<br>
very few repair mechanisms for DNA damage caused by erratic free radicals.<br>
Our bodies can live with this only because we have multiple mitos in each<br>
cell and because they can divide and multipy within the cell (except<br>
sometimes damaged ones mulitply faster than the good ones and destroy the<br>
cell). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A much too simplistic view.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It was only one sentence among many.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't make too much of it, ok?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Notice I did say EXCESS.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, you're right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe. But it is also going to kill you quite quickly for other reasons.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some have suggested( maybe on this list) that the low temp </i><br>
<i>&gt;may lead to life extension.</i><br>
<p>
No question of it IMO. I am very pleased that my morning body temp is only<br>
95.7'F and it only rises to 97.2'F during the day. (and I am *not* hypothyroid)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This could become a seperate thread: Low Body Temp.- Good/Bad?</i><br>
<p>
I think its definitely good, but CR, melatonin, (and genes) are the only<br>
harmless ways to lower it that I know of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Tell me if anyone knows how this view could be bad,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; For the reasons stated above (and many others),</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Please don't hold out on me.:-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;When my thoughts are wrong I what all of them changed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't leave my plans in a void.</i><br>
<p>
As we go along and as my time permits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;its very bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; excluding the negatives below (and many others).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;excluding the arguments of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;1) Willpower requirements.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;2) Missed opportunities due to confinment to reclining wheelchair and IV.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;How were you intending to do the basic exercise functions (walking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; breathing 'fully') you listed if you are confined to a wheelchair.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Geez, I won't chain myself too it or anything.:-) </i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll get up when I have too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Intense breathing exercises can build heart and diaphram muscles.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't do much for the heart I don't believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's not forget isometric exercises, working muscles against each other</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the bicept/tricept "show me your muscle" pose.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think isometrices will fulfill the function of either aerobics<br>
(heart, lung, arteries, veins, immune system, happy endorphins, etc( or<br>
weight work (prevent osteoporosis).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sorry, I don't often give references for my beliefs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm too busy preparing for the possiblities.</i><br>
<p>
But you *do* need to take time to read and understand the science<br>
behind those possibilties!<br>
