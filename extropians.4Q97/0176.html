Long-time denizens of this list and the Transhuman list will recognize the<br>
discussion in this thread as essentially identical to the one Rich Artym, I<br>
and others carried on more that a year ago.  Doc Artym called his theory of<br>
absolute subjectivism in morality and ethics "Unlimited Individual Freedom"<br>
(remember "UIF"?) and the discussion was initiated by one of the usual<br>
triggers for such conversations, debate over the merits of free markets.<br>
 Ultimately, though, the debate came to center on disagreement between those<br>
(like me) who make claim to the existence of an "objective morality" and<br>
those who reject such claims.<br>
<p>
In that torrent of words, I attempted to make clear that I rejected any<br>
METAPHYSICALLY or AUTHORITATIVELY objective morality.  Rather, I find one<br>
core set of moral values to be "objectively right" in the nature of life in<br>
society for volitional beings.  Much of the opposition to a claim of<br>
"objective morality" is in fact an attack on the straw men of claims of<br>
metaphysical or authoritative objectivity.  <br>
<p>
I see that one can rationally reject the notion of objective morality if one<br>
rejects either (1) the notion of "free" will or (2) the desire to live in<br>
society.  These are unsatisfying alternatives to me.  In the case of<br>
volition, while I see an ultimate material determinism in the behavior of<br>
sentient beings, it seems that determinism is overwhelmed by the more<br>
important emergent phenomena characteristic of complex adaptive systems such<br>
as a conscious mind.  In other words, the insights of complexity theory<br>
trivialize the ultimately deterministic character of consciousness, because<br>
any model capable of truly "predicting" the behavior of a conscious system<br>
must be at least as complex as the system modeled.  Given the exquisite --<br>
and growing -- complexity of conscious systems, our minds are thus<br>
EFFECTIVELY indeterminate and the notion of a "free will" is therefore more<br>
useful than any "metaphysically true" statement that we are ULTIMATELY<br>
determinate. Interestingly, I have not found in transhumanist circles any<br>
real objection to the idea of an objective reality based on determinism.  We<br>
as a cultural movement seem to accept the notion of "free will" without much<br>
question.<br>
<p>
The second "escape hatch" can give more comfort -- if that is the word -- for<br>
those who proclaim the ultimate subjectivity of morals.  There is no<br>
objective morality for one who rejects life in society and becomes a TRUE<br>
hermit, completely insulated from interaction with other volitional actors.<br>
 For the man who is truly an island, there is no moral right or wrong, and<br>
others can make no moral judgment of him.  I personally would find this an<br>
unacceptably high price to pay for the dubious pleasure of being able to<br>
validate a notion of purely subjective morals, but will concede that the a<br>
priori condition of life in society is "no more than" a subjective matter of<br>
taste.  At least until some god-like nanotechnology places mastery over the<br>
material universe at the fingertips of a lone individual, though, this taste<br>
for life in society has much to commend it to the individual who desires to<br>
live a life of more than bestial comfort.<br>
<p>
With these introductory comments, let me attempt to restate my thesis: The<br>
process of social interaction of volitional beings itself contains the<br>
information necessary to derive certain rules of conduct -- "moral values" --<br>
which are, in the most meaningful sense possible in discussions of morals,<br>
ethics and law, the "best" such rules.  Distilled to the most meaningfully<br>
abstract level, such values include reciprocity and the non-initiation of<br>
force.  I concede that it is logically possible to express such values in<br>
conditional terms, e.g. "If one wishes to be free of unprovoked violence, one<br>
should not provoke violence."  Those opposed to claims of "objective"<br>
morality seem to find this logical possibility to be important, even<br>
decisive.  I do not.  <br>
<p>
As I point out above, there are only two choices concerning life in society:<br>
Either one lives utterly alone, or one lives in some society.  A "society of<br>
thieves" is not physically possible, over any great length of time.  This is<br>
verifiable in any "natural history" of morality (i.e. HISTORY itself)  and in<br>
theoretical terms (i.e. game theory).  Thus the ultimately conditional nature<br>
of moral statements can be distilled to only one conditional statement: If<br>
one chooses to live in society, one MUST observe certain FUNDAMENTAL rules of<br>
conduct.  Such rules of conduct have traditionally been expressed as "moral<br>
values" and calling them such does no violence to reason.  In ultimate<br>
analysis, we can indeed see that calling such rules "moral values" is a sort<br>
of short hand, masking the conditional premise of a choice of life in<br>
society, which may be logically considered arbitrary.  But, as I have<br>
attempted to explain above, I find that expression of this conditional<br>
statement is trivial.<br>

<i>&gt;  To be sure, you, I, and\or anyone else may agree not to steal, nor</i><br>
initiate<br>
<i>&gt;  force and coercion in any way. [snip] However, suppose we agree to steal</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt;  produce a hostile coexistence?  Once again, the means selected and applied</i><br>
<i>&gt;  produces the end mutually desired and identified. Would you then call this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "morally wrong" although you agreed to it? </i><br>
<p>
I would say that the choice itself was "morally wrong" because inconsistent<br>
with the prior choice of life in society.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Let's look at the third option: Suppose the end you choose is peaceful</i><br>
<i>&gt;  coexistence and select the appropriate means, non theft, etc. to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this end, but another within your social realm prefers a hostile</i><br>
enviroment<br>
<i>&gt;  and selects predatory means appropriate to achieve this end. Since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  predatory means chosen will produce the hostile environment end desired,</i><br>
are<br>
<i>&gt;  not these means chosen technically right the same as yours are technically</i><br>
<i>&gt;  right? What remains for you to call wrong, and why? The end chosen, is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  not? Thus must you presume to qualify terms, and arrive at: Technically</i><br>
<i>&gt;  right, but "morally wrong." Right AND wrong applied to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;  circumstance?  True, yet false? Exist, yet does not exist? Dead, yet</i><br>
alive?<br>
<i>&gt;  Doesn't this make you a bit suspicious of the concept, morality?  </i><br>
<p>
Not at all: You posit a "good thief", in the sense of one good AT thievery.<br>
 But our thief is a bad person, in moral terms, because she chooses conduct<br>
inconsistent with life in society.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  The confusion, conflicts and contradictions are derived from illusory</i><br>
<i>&gt;  beliefs that lead to pursuit of the impossible. An end chosen is a matter</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;  volition, a natural condition that is not subject to proof or disproof. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is means and only means that are subject to evaluation as right or wrong.</i><br>
To<br>
<i>&gt;  presume to evaluate a chosen end as right or wrong is to claim the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individual creator of said end as personal property to be evaluated as</i><br>
means<br>
<i>&gt;  to one's own goal. </i><br>
<p>
In a certain sense you are right, Delmar, in that the act of moral judgment<br>
itself is subjective.  However, in any sense in which morality can have<br>
meaning, those judgments can be validated externally as consistent with the<br>
social life of conscious, i.e. volitional, agents.  Moral JUDGMENTS do have<br>
subjects and objects, of necessity.  But making the judgment alone does not<br>
make the object of the judgment "property" at all.  In making this statement<br>
you leap forward, from morals, through ethics (in my personal vocabulary, the<br>
art of applied morals) to law.  A long chain of reasoning and social practice<br>
is masked by this leap.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  So, what is "morality", that is  what is the meaning of the term, and by</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reference to what is the meaning derived? I can find not a trace of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objective criteria except subjective personal preference as you</i><br>
acknowledge.<br>
<i>&gt;  Ergo, "morality" is dependent on being created by individual mind. Having</i><br>
<i>&gt;  examined and weighed all the factors known to me from root premise to end</i><br>
<i>&gt;  result, I  am obliged to accept the definition that corresponds to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Morality is a FEELING; specifically a DOMINANT feeling of a "universal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ought" nearly universally felt. It is a feeling that there exists an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objective and universal standard of values. It is a feeling that one</i><br>
"ought"<br>
<i>&gt;  to discover and live by these values. It is a feeling that most</i><br>
individual's<br>
<i>&gt;  look to and depend on to measure their self value and the value of others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is a feeling that directs thoughts, conclusions, beliefs and actions</i><br>
like<br>
<i>&gt;  no other. It is the ultimate warden of the psyche. It is the ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt;  religion for it commands more subservience of more individuals that all</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  others put together.</i><br>
<p>
Now you seem to speak of the psychological aspects of morality.  In fact, we<br>
do indeed have moral feelings or sentiments.  A good working hypothesis is<br>
that such moral feelings are simply the subjective experience of our own<br>
moral values.  However, as extropians, we seek to make the workings of our<br>
own minds as rational as possible: We may still have moral sentiments, no<br>
matter how transformed and augmented we are, but we value rational<br>
examination and formation of such sentiments as much as possible.  But that<br>
we have such feelings makes us no less capable of pursuing a rational<br>
morality.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Since "morality" is a matter of feelings peculiar to each individual, (but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  believed to be an objective dictate of nature), is it any wonder that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  endless disagreements are endlessly "resolved" by violent conflict?  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concept, morality, is by billions believed to be an absolute necessity for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  peaceful coexistence. They believe this even as the earth has been for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  centuries, and still is, drenched in blood in the name of morality. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tells not of any truth of "morality", but of a suicidal and destructive</i><br>
<i>&gt;  commitment to a revered and  dominant fallacy.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely that an UNREFLECTIVE reliance on moral sentiment as the<br>
sole guide for action is apt to lead to violent disagreement.  However, I<br>
conclude from this that we must work all the harder to rationally examine our<br>
own morals and seek the most objective possible guide to them.<br>

<i>&gt;  Could you reasonably argue that all my "ises" (descriptive</i><br>

For me, at least, these questions are answered by identifying the one<br>
conditional premise upon which morality is based, i.e. volitional actors<br>
living in society.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; Even if God existed it would not produce an objective morality free from </i><br>
<i>&gt;  contradictions because an obvious question would immediately arise, is God</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  independent of the concepts of good and evil? If the answer is yes then</i><br>
God <br>

<p>
<i>&gt;  or otherwise, "should" do so is not clear. If the answer is no then the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  statement "God is good" becomes a vacuous tautology, about as deep as </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "God is God".</i><br>
<p>
It seems such logical conundrums are irrelevant to a rational morality and<br>
are of the same type as asking whether an omnipotent god could make a rock<br>
too heavy for her to move, or whether on omniscient god can have free will.<br>
 By definition, the god in your problem has no society, since she is in an<br>
infinitely superior power position.  I'll allow that there can be no morality<br>
for such an infinitely powerful being and, if at the end of the universe such<br>
a single being exists, then morality will have been extinguished as a logical<br>
possibility or practical necessity.<br>

 <br>
<i>&gt;  You keep on talking about whether your goals will prevail or whether they </i><br>

<i>&gt; subordinate</i><br>
<i>&gt;  yourself.  Those are not your options.  You can either be wrong, or right.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Opinions are either wrong or right.  Goals are either wrong or right.  And</i><br>

<i>&gt;  exam:  "Take a position for or against the truth.  Defend your position."</i><br>
<p>
For me, this anguished note is uncalled for.  Moral "truth" is not of the<br>
same character as metaphysical or logical truth.  One might say that there<br>
are metaphysical or logical Truths, but only moral truths, because morality<br>
can not be reduced "below" the level of social systems; it is an emergent<br>
phenomena of the complex adaptive system that is the life in society of<br>
volitional beings.  However, viewed from within the framework of such<br>
systems, they ARE truths.  Viewed from outside such framework, they mean<br>
nothing.<br>
