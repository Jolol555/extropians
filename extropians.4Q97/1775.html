   (c) (11/23/97) Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
   Because we don't have videotape of the U.S. Navy shooting<br>
   down TWA 800, we cannot prove by 100% they did.  However, <br>
   we can prove by 100% that the FBI is spreading new lies <br>
   to wrongfully damage the TWA 800 Navy-missile theory.<br>
<p>
   On the Bob Grant show (WOR Radio, 11/21/97) FBI agent <br>
   James Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's "investigation,"<br>
   said in reference to my TWA Flight 800 inquiry [1]: <br>
<p>
       Ian Goddard just two weeks ago was quoted on <br>
       CNN, if CNN quoted him accurately, saying he <br>
       had made it all up, just to sort of poke fun <br>
       at the U.S. government. He backed off of that <br>
 ---&gt;  remark, Goddard did, but he sent me an email <br>
 ---&gt;  saying in fact he knew it was not true.<br>
<p>
   Here you will find the email I sent to Kallstrom, which<br>
   was the article "CNN's Ian Goddard Plot." Kallstrom read<br>
   from it during the FBI's final TWA 800 press conference:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9711">http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9711</a>&amp;L=flight-800&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=64<br>
34 <br>
<p>
   The beginning of the sentence that Kallstrom read, which was<br>
   the part he did not read, states: "I've always promoted what<br>
   I believe..." The email I sent Kallstrom was an unambiguous<br>
   defense of the  fact that I never perpetrated a hoax.  Yet<br>
   Kallstrom stands before the American people and tells you<br>
   the opposite of the truth, he tells you that my message<br>
   refuting the false charges of hoax was an admission of<br>
   a hoax. As all can see by simply reading my message,<br>
   Kallstrom's claim is a lie. So why must he lie??<br>
<p>
   Kallstrom can't seem to stop. At the press conference mentioned <br>
   above, Kallstrom said that when Pierre Salinger called him a few <br>
   weeks ago, Salinger said he no longer believed the Navy-missile<br>
   theory. Always eager to initiate and/or promote government <br>
   disinformation, CNN commented on that lie, saying:<br>
<p>
       He (James Kallstrom) spoke to Pierre Salinger <br>
       who now says he believes the friendly fire <br>
       rumor was just that, a rumor, that is was false.<br>
<p>
   The only falsehoods are those flowing from the FBI and CNN.<br>
   On WABC [2] Kallstrom said "Salinger's actually recanted."<br>
   Salinger NEVER told anyone he no longer believes the theory.<br>
   While he said that due to the unrelenting media attacks he <br>
   would stop talking about it,  he still believes it is true.<br>
   On the Bob Grant show, Kallstrom also said, in reference to <br>
   the evidence Salinger has presented,  "He had  no witnesses,<br>
   in reality, he had nothing."   No witnesses,  no radar tape,<br>
   no drone photo. If we keep saying it, maybe it will be true.<br>
<p>
   Kallstrom also said: "Eyewitness testimony is not evidence."<br>
<p>
   The truth is that the FBI is actively and willfully spreading <br>
   false information about Pierre Salinger and myself. With such<br>
   proven lies, how is anyone to believe they are spreading true<br>
   information about the crash of TWA Flight 800? If TWA 800 was<br>
   not shot down with a Navy missile, why should the FBI need to <br>
   assault that theory with lies?  W a k e  U p  A m e r i c a !<br>
<p>
   With the FBI planning to prosecute another Navy-missile <br>
   theorist, James Sanders, author of "The Downing TWA Flight <br>
   800," the truth is only too clear to see: the FBI is out to <br>
   destroy those who have promoted the Navy-missile theory by <br>
   any means possible. This is a vicious  war on freedom of<br>
   speech, inquiry, and the right to question authority.<br>
<p>
<p>
   CAN YOU SEE THE PATTERN?<br>
<p>
   Kallstrom said I told him I lied....  A LIE<br>
   Kallstrom said Salinger renounced...  A LIE<br>
   Kallstrom said witneses not evidence  A LIE<br>
   Kallstrom said no naval excersises..  A LIE<br>
   Kallstrom said the USN is innocent..  A<br>
