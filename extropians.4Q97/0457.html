This is not quite what I had in mind as a starting point. I think we<br>
need<br>
to accept that the current economic/political system exists, that it<br>
works pretty well, and that it has a fairly high inertia. Therefore, the<br>
most we can expect is gradual movement, except as the system is forced<br>
to change in response to very rapid technological change. Example:<br>
technology permits direct democracy and real-time access to all<br>
government functions, but neither is likely because the system doesn't<br>
require it: inertia wins.<br>
<p>
IMO, the existing system suffices to permit technolological advance to<br>
the singularity. Any non-radical change is unlikely to advance or<br>
retard the event by much. Any radical change is likely to retard the<br>
event because of of the upheaval associated with the change, regardless<br>
of the relative efficiency of the resulting system.<br>
