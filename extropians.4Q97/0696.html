Hi!<br>

It has been tried to insert fetus neurons in the spinal cord to cure<br>
handicaped persons. Also, it has been tried to insert fetus neurons into<br>
the brain to slow down aging, I believe Switzerland is the place to look<br>
for this. As far as I know the results have been negative, it doesn't<br>
work, at least for now.<br>

<p>
I think we had a small communication problem here. When I mean<br>
transplant, I mean body transplant since - like I wrote in my last post<br>
- we can't transplant the brain. So when I say that we can't transplant<br>
the glial cells, I mean that the glial cells will be kept with the<br>
neurons. I think you misundertood me, we both mean the same thing. It<br>
was just a problem with language.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; My guess is no, to get relativistic effects you would need huge</i><br>

<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, using relativity to move into the future faster isn't life</i><br>

<i>&gt; them out across a longer span of time as seen by an external observer.</i><br>
<p>
The idea would be to wonder in space (not very far since we wouldn't<br>
have much time) until the scientists on earth could figure out a way to<br>
stop aging. We would spend, for example, 20 years in space while on<br>
earth 500 years would have passed. We wouldn't die of aging and when we<br>
would return we would certainly have aging cured.<br>
<p>
BTW, thank you for your reply on the questions I sent you.<br>

<p>
I agree this sounds wonderful but I am quite skeptic if this<br>
technologies will arrive in time to save us. In my opinion, the biggest<br>
problem is the application of any technique to all cells. Today we can<br>
build virus to transfer genes to the cells but only a tiny percentage of<br>
a culture of cells can be modified. And we can't just correct a few of<br>
the cells, we have to correct most - not all but most - of them. And<br>
that is a major problem<br>
