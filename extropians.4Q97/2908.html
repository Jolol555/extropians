The usual economic use of the term "externality" refers to a cost (or <br>
benefit)  imposed on someone who is not part of the transaction or <br>
does not have a choice in the matter.<br>
<p>
When chattel slavery was legal, some labor cost was an externality: <br>
the loss of enjoyment from being required to work 16 hours a day <br>
would be imposed on the slaves who had no choice, not on the <br>
slaveowners who make the decision.<br>
<p>
Today, if an employer tries to impose the same work regimen, he will <br>
pay his laborers dearly and still see many of them depart for more <br>
pleasant positions elsewhere.  Labor is no longer an externality.<br>
<p>
In regard to a gun, benefits received by the gun buyers are not <br>
externalities.  Neither are costs imposed upon criminals who attempt <br>
to rob gun buyers.  The benefit to PEOPLE IN GENERAL from having <br>
those criminals removed from circulation, is an externality; and <br>
almost everyone benefits in this way.  The cost to PEOPLE IN GENERAL <br>
from gun accidents is an externality; but in most cases this cost is <br>
born by the gun buyers, *not* by people in general.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are myriad resource costs in producing a firearm. There : is</i><br>
<i>&gt; one benefit -- the firearm itself.  Any remote benefit not :</i><br>
<i>&gt; balanced against costs in the decision to manufacture is external. :</i><br>
<i>&gt; Self-defense falls into this category.</i><br>
<p>
The benefit of self-defense accrues to people who willingly take part <br>
in the gun buying transaction and who willingly pay a price for that <br>
benefit.  About as far from an externality as any effect can be.<br>
