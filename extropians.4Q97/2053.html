<i>&gt; Agreed. How about "alt.extropic"?</i><br>
<p>
I thought about the same thing - and there already are 2 extropian<br>
newsgroups on the usenet:alt.extropians<br>
alt.extropians.forbidden.topics<br>
<p>
Those newsgroups don't seem to get used a lot, though (on alt.extropians I<br>
only found one thread - and that one has been crossposted to many other<br>
groups, too). I wonder why. Since anybody can post into this list and<br>
there's an archive, it's not much more "private" than the newsgroups.<br>
Newsgroups have one major advantage: offline-reading, so you only download<br>
the posts you believe to be interesting.<br>
<p>
The only problem I see with newsgroups is spamming, but we've had that on<br>
the list, too...<br>
<p>
later,<br>
