                      A Letter to Vince Foster<br>
                        by "J. Orlin Grabbe"<br>
<p>
                      <a href="mailto:kalliste@aci.net">mailto:kalliste@aci.net</a><br>
<p>
      Dear Vince,                              Circa 12 October, 1997?<br>
<p>
      So you wanna be a nuclear spy?  You say your Swiss account is<br>
running low, and you need some pointers where to find those little intel<br>
tidbits to be sold for salvage?  You know, depending on what's hot in<br>
the market?<br>
<p>
     Well, okey dokey. I'll tell you what little I know.  Maybe help <br>
you out a little.  On account of you're such a good friend and all.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Let's start with SIOP.  That's Single Integrated Operational Plan.<br>
It ties together all the military nuclear weapons and all the different <br>
regional plans -- you know, the different nuke options of the military <br>
commands in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and Europe.  Britain even has a <br>
part.  Well, SIOP is ESI:  Extremely Senstive Information.  <br>
<p>
      Translation: BIG BUCKS if you can get a hold of a piece of it. <br>
Now, Vince, let me explain the problem, so you'll know what's going<br>
on, and where to go to get the good stuff.  Okay?  You think you have <br>
headaches keeping track of money. Well, let me tell you, the <br>
military's like the three, or six, or sixteen different faces of Eve, <br>
and they'll all be at war with each other if they're not careful.<br>
  <br>
      Hell, we might be engaged with China and they send the signal to the <br>
wrong set of missiles, and nuke Teheran. <br>
<p>
      Or say there's a launch off the Pacific coast, but the early warning <br>
system is down and no one knows what's coming.  <br>
<p>
      Or they see it coming but they can't get hold of the President who is <br>
out whitewater rafting. <br>
<p>
      Or the helicopter arrives at the White House from Quantico to whisk <br>
the Prez to Andrews Air Force Base, where the flying command post <br>
awaits, and the Secret Service shots the chopper down (which they <br>
almost did in an exercise the other day). <br>
<p>
      Or the Prez gives the authorization to RE-TAL-I-ATE, but he can't <br>
communicate with his forces to set anything in motion.<br>
<p>
<p>
      See, we got us an ORGANIZATIONAL problem here. Suppose'n we go to<br>
war.  You got the White House Situation Room, down underground, below the <br>
Oval Office. You got the National Military Command Center (NMCC) in the <br>
Pentagon, third floor.  You got the alternative NMCC buried in Raven Rock, <br>
Pennsylvania (8 miles from Camp David), in case the first one's f**ked up <br>
(more than normal, I mean). <br>
<p>
<p>
      You got the SAC underground command post at Offutt Air Force base near <br>
Omaha, Nebraska. You got the NORAD underground command post inside <br>
Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. Talk about moles!  These here outfits <br>
have gotta TALK and gotta SEE!  See what I mean?<br>
<p>
<p>
      Then you got your airborne commands. They gotta talk, see, and EVADE <br>
no matter WHERE they are.  There's "Nightwatch".  That's the National <br>
Emergency Airborne Command--a flying nest for the President, Joint Chiefs of <br>
Staff, and Commander of the Strategic Air Command (with room for a few <br>
hookers to relieve the tension) to give orders and preside over the end of <br>
civilization as we know it. (They can fire the land-based missiles using the  <br>
Airborne Launch Control System.)<br>
<p>
<p>
      Then you got "Cover All", or whatever they call it now, the<br>
flying Command post of the Strategic Air Command with the Post Attack Command <br>
and Control System (PACCS) (and we hope SAC number two still takes <br>
orders from number one, who is flying around with the Prez). Then you <br>
got all your little sub units: "Blue Eagle" Pacific Command, "Scope Light" <br>
Atlantic Command, "Silk Purse" European Command.  The names and <br>
details may change from time to time (hint: more bucks here).<br>
<p>
      Then you got all your side shows, like JEEP, the Joint Emergency <br>
Action Plan.  That's a plan for evacuating a select number of government <br>
and military people, the chosen few, the ELECT, who get RAPTURED AWAY to a <br>
place of safety in case of nuclear war, some to Raven Rock, others to the<br>
"Special Facility" at Mt. Weather in Virginia.  <br>
<p>
      That's so they'll be around to populate a post-nuke nation.  It'll be <br>
a millennial golden age of LAWYERS and GENERALS.  You remember me <br>
telling you about Hassan i-Sabah, the "old man of the mountains", the <br>
leader of the assassins? How he used to indoctrinate his followers, <br>
showing them a vision of Paradise, where he would get them blissed out <br>
on hashish, and they would wake up in a garden with fruit trees, and <br>
flowing brooks, and whoreys attending to their every need (I think <br>
they spelled it "horis" back then)?  And then they would be willing to <br>
die to get back to Paradise?  Well, here in the old U. S. of A. some <br>
of the chosen few get to spend some time each year in the BOHEMIAN GROVE!<br>
<p>
<p>
      Just a little aside.  A friend of mine used to have a job inspecting<br>
the stored food down in one of those FEMA hideaway places--the "National <br>
Warning Center" down in Olney, Maryland. You know, FEMA, Federal Emergency <br>
Management Agency? She told me they had cans of powdered instant SPINACH <br>
OMELET.  And the johns were on SPRINGS, so a person sitting on the toilet at <br>
the time of a direct nuclear hit wouldn't bust their buns! (I guess there was <br>
an anticipation some of the people they would stick in these FEMA hidey holes <br>
were full of shit.) But we are getting off topic...<br>
<p>
Okay.<br>
<p>
      So you got a little COMMUNICATION problem.  A little<br>
CO-ORDINATION problem.  That's where C3I comes in.  You say that <br>
"SEE cubed EYE".  That stands for COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATION, and<br>
INTELLIGENCE.  C3I is the thread that patches the SIOP together.  It's the<br>
glue that keep the nuclear pasties where they oughta be!  <br>
<p>
      C4I adds Counter-measures to the list. Very important: lotssa stuff<br>
to steal here.  This is about computers, satellites, phones, and radios.  <br>
(The Mitre Corp's big in this area.  You may know about them, since <br>
they're also getting into electronic cash these days.)  C3I basically <br>
started with David Packard who saw that military communications <br>
weren't worth beans.  He also initiated those flying Presidential <br>
command posts, using modified Boeing planes (E4Bs).<br>
<p>
      [ 'S' and 'R' add Surveillance and Reconnaissance for C4ISR - TH ]<br>
<p>
      Well, he departed in 1971.  Five years later, after the ever idiotic<br>
Pentagon had gone out and bought a $100 million worth of Honeywell computers<br>
that weren't even intended to operate in on-line mode (on-line's important <br>
for a communication system, don't you think?), an official in the Defense<br>
Communication Agency reported that the system was crashing on average once<br>
every 35 minutes.  ("Sorry, Mr. President, we would like to send that 1 <br>
megaton baby on its way to Moscow, but the damned system's down.  Anyone<br>
call Federal Express yet?")  <br>
<p>
<p>
      Wimex (that the Worldwide Military Command and Control System) didn't<br>
go on line at NORAD until Sept 1979.  And they did a mobilization simulation<br>
("Proud Spirit") the next year, and Wimex fell on its ass, leaving military <br>
commanders in the dark about the readiness of their units for 12 hours.  <br>
<p>
<p>
      So you see, Vincey boy, that national security's all about computers <br>
and communications and co-ordination.  They had military transports <br>
landing at military bases where the troops supposed to get on them <br>
hadn't even got the word to march.  We could have lost the war because <br>
we had stupid computers and stupid programmers.  Those Minutemans with <br>
megaton bombs ain't too scarey on 64k of RAM.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Another example:  in the older missiles on the Navy's Poseidon<br>
submarine the missile targets would be recorded on 8-inch magnetic disks.<br>
The order to fire would come from an EAM, an Emergency Action Message.<br>
<p>
      This would be in code and would be compared to the version of the same<br>
thing sitting in the submarine's Red Box.  <br>
<p>
      If they were the same, the message would be considered authentic and <br>
the firing procedure would commence. (The subs present interesting <br>
communication problems, by the way, and besides the communication <br>
stations around the world, you've got the TACAMO planes flying around, <br>
relaying communications to the subs.  You could also use ELF,<br>
extremely low frequency, broadcasts, but that would require antennas<br>
hundreds of miles long.)<br>
<p>
      Well, now the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) keeps the President<br>
or his successors (and in the National Command Authority control system <br>
which executes the SIOP, it's the VP, the Secretary of Defense, and the <br>
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in that order--not the VP, the Speaker of the <br>
House, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, etc.--nope, Haig wasn't in<br>
charge after all) in touch with his nuclear forces around the world.  DCA has <br>
hubs at the White House and at Camp David, which is tied right into Raven<br>
Rock.<br>
<p>
      But anyway, computer-wise, let me tell you about three money-making <br>
organizations you want to pay special attention to.  There's NRO, the <br>
National Reconnaisance Organization; NSA, the National Security Agency; and <br>
DMA, the Defense Mapping Agency.  They tell us what's coming (NRO), let us <br>
launch a response (NSA), and help us locate the goddamn target (DMA).<br>
<p>
Okay?  <br>
<p>
      NRO is currently much of the nation's eyes and ears--a 24-hour a<br>
day operation.  They're the ones in charge of the spy satellites.  The Air <br>
Force does the actual operation, but NRO is in charge.  NRO's run by a  <br>
committee, the National Reconnaissance Executive Committee, chaired by the<br>
CIA director.  That's so the satellite PRETTY PICTURES get shared by <br>
everyone, not just the fly-boys. &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      Since 1992 NRO's been functionally organized (hint, hint, get specs) <br>
but before that there was an Air Force part, based out in El Segundo, <br>
California, that worked on Air Force reconnaisance satellites and made <br>
deals with contracters, a CIA part (they developed the KH-11 and <br>
RHYOLITE satellites), and a Navy part, responsible for the Navy's <br>
ocean surveillance satellites.<br>
<p>
      The signals those satellites pick up are processed by the NSA, that<br>
big sprawling place out at Fort George C. Meade, Maryland. They got regional  <br>
SIGINT center for the satellite data at Menwith Hill Station in <br>
England ("Hi!");  Bad Aibling Station, Germany; Kunia, Oahu, Hawaii; Lackland Air Force Base<br>
Training Annex, San Antonio, TX; Buckley Air National Guard Field, Aurora, <br>
CO; and Fort Gordon, Georgia.<br>
<p>
<p>
      They also got a big South American listening post in Panama. Remember <br>
those Panama Canal negotiations, which your pal Jackson Stephens had a<br>
financial interest in?  We were listening in on the Panama private chat. <br>
Well, remember old pineapple face, Noriega?  He was spying on our spying. <br>
Paid those NSA boys a regular fee to bring him tapes and computer printouts. <br>
(Your modern DIC-TA-TOR-SHIP ain't what it used to be.  Castro's got a big <br>
computer room in the Palace of the Revolution. I tell you, there's more to <br>
controlling a country than just the occasional photography session cuttin' <br>
down sugar cane with a machette in the hot sun.) <br>
<p>
<p>
      Anyway, NSA develops secure voice and data transmission links on<br>
the Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) and the Satellite Data<br>
System (SDS).  They are also responsible for communications security with<br>
respect to strategic weapons systems such as the Minuteman missile.  That's<br>
to prevent UN-AUTHOR-IZED access or interference or jamming. (There's a <br>
special message category called a NUCFLASH, which is notification of the<br>
unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons.  Wonder why they have it?)  Targets <br>
can be changed by inputting a new set of numbers in the missile's memory.  <br>
<p>
<p>
      Virtual bugs can be serious.  A few years ago a hacker kid got into <br>
Pentagon computers, and came pretty close to causing a nuclear EVENT, and <br>
they bumped his old man's ass right out of there.  And back in November 1979, <br>
a computer technician accidentally fed a training tape that simulated a <br>
missile raid against the U.S. into the live NORAD early warning system.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Now get this:  the NSA develops the codes by which the President<br>
must identify himself to authorize a nuclear strike.  You know the  <br>
* Football *?  That's the black briefcase carried by the military Presidential<br>
shadow.  It contains the Gold Codes (the Presidential instructions to<br>
authorize the release of nuclear weapons), the SIOP attack options, and a<br>
decision book. The Gold Codes are changed daily, one set going to the White <br>
House for the Football, and simultaneously to nuclear command posts around<br>
the world.  The attack options are just subsets of potential targets.  For <br>
example, SIOP-5D, which came out in 1980, identified 40,000 potential <br>
targets, and gave the President Limited Attack Options, Selected Attack <br>
Options, Major Attack Options, and Regional Nuclear Options.  There were <br>
also two special categories: a pre-emptive strike against the Russkies, and <br>
LOW (Launch on Warning) or LAU (Lauch Under Attack).<br>
<p>
<p>
      Wonder who is on the list now?  If you're looking to find out, watch <br>
out for the two-man rule: no one person is supposed to have access to nuclear <br>
weapons and release codes and such, so you may need an accomplice, depending <br>
on what you're fixin' to do.  Hell, the President can't even open the   <br>
Football--only the Director of the Military Office, the warrant officers,<br>
and the military aides have the combo.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The NSA put out the * National COMSEC Plan for Space Systems and<br>
Nuclear Weapons Systems * back in 1982.  This has been updated, I guarantee<br>
you, and you can get good cash for the latest version.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Now, under W Group in the NSA's Directorate of Operations is the<br>
Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center (DEFSMAC).  That's a joint<br>
DIA-NSA operation, which is the principal body of men and women who keep<br>
minute-by-minute track of threats to the U. S. of A. from missiles, aircraft,<br>
and other types of overt military activity.  Anything you can get on them<br>
might give your enterprising enemy nation good ideas how to muck up their <br>
operation.  (What do you care?  You got one of them JEEP-1 cards, don'tcha?)<br>
Their stuff goes everywhere: CIA, White House Situation Room, whatnot.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Remember when Russians weren't even allowed to visit Dallas, Texas,<br>
on account of all the surrounding defense electronics?  Well, one of the<br>
reasons has to do with E-Systems, which does a lot of NSA's computer software <br>
and hardware.  (They developed that little * Herf gun *, you know, the one<br>
that can take out a plane's guidance and control system?  The pilot finds <br>
himself pulling levers and pushing buttons, and nothing responds.  Deadly <br>
mother.  Good for causing plane crashes.) You already probably know a lot<br>
about them, because of their relationship to Systematics.  The NSA's got<br>
some new computers coming on.  Try to get the operating system or anything<br>
like that.  <br>
<p>
      The Defense Mapping Agency gets things contoured out so as the <br>
missiles can find the target.  Once upon a time SIOP was just a set of <br>
black lines, all converging at Moscow, on the big map of the Soviet <br>
Union that Curtis LeMay used to have. To get there, each SAC plane <br>
would carry the best maps of their target, most of them pre-WW2 jobs <br>
not worth shit. Hell, back in 1941 RAF bombers had problems getting <br>
their bombs to within a five mile radius of the target.  Not very <br>
PRE-CISE.  (Bombs made one of them Poisson distributions around <br>
target:  read * Gravity's Rainbow * ).<br>
<p>
      [ FX: "That is, what we call Circular Error Probables..." ]<br>
<p>
      Well, we still got that same precision problem. You saw that video <br>
they played over and over the in Gulf War?  That bomb dropping down the <br>
smokestack of a factory?  Don't you believe the BS for a minute. Seventy-five <br>
percent of those bombs went astray.  As for enemy terrain, we didn't know <br>
diddly-squat about the Soviet Union until the CIA got the word to do a high-<br>
altitude plane, and they got Lockheed to turn out the U-2 in record time. It <br>
could fly at 70,000 feet. But tough on the pilot: two hours of pure oxygen <br>
so he wouldn't get the bends, and a diet of steak and eggs because there <br>
weren't any toilet facilities. Later the Joint Chiefs acquired control of <br>
the spy planes like SR-71 and RC-135, and signals were processed by the <br>
NSA and photos by the CIA.  <br>
<p>
<p>
      But satellites, not spy planes, map most of it now, and the contours <br>
of the target terrain are stored in the missile's computer so it will know <br>
when it has reached target.  You know, like a gif file with all the naughty     <br>
bits, where the computer matches pixel against pixel until it knows it's <br>
arrived on target and there's a great nuclear orgasm.  (No way to avoid <br>
digital because a few high altitude nukes will send out an EMP, an<br>
electromagnetic pulse, that will wipe out the Global Positioning System.)<br>
<p>
<p>
      Now, never forget, Vincey boy, there's always a ready market for<br>
plutonium.  You know, the stuff they put in the bombs to make them go BOOM?<br>
Well, now, all the nuclear facilities are guarded by a little outfit called<br>
the Wackenhut Corporation.  Ed Meese came in and said, How my friends gonna<br>
make any money if the Marines do the job?  Hell, we all know each Marine<br>
comes with two PR agents, so we'll let one Wacky Hutterite do the job of  <br>
three.  So it was, and now we're all getting rich, because those Wacky <br>
Hutterites are as entrepreneurial as hell.  <br>
<p>
<p>
      Or similar products.  Remember how in the early 80s just when you <br>
were getting into the laundry business, they decided it was important to <br>
keep both Iran and Iraq equally armed, so no one would win the war?  Well, <br>
Iraq was about to get its ass kicked, so we made a crash program to help the <br>
Iraqis.  (In the Iran-Contra hearings even Ollie North said the coverup was <br>
itself a coverup. Because it wasn't Iran we were mostly dealing with, it was <br>
Iraq.)    <br>
<p>
<p>
      Now you know Ihsan Barbouti, the Iraqi architect who has that <br>
engineering firm in Frankfurt and who came over here with a contract to <br>
build Iraqi airfields?  Well he invested in TK-7 of Oklahoma City, Pipeline<br>
Recovery Systems of Dallas, and Product Ingredient Technology of Boca<br>
Raton.  Want to know why?  TK-7 makes a fuel additive that can extend<br>
the range of SCUD missiles and jet aircraft.  Pipeline Recovery coats pipes <br>
so they're usable in nuclear reactors and chemical-weapons plants.  And <br>
Product Ingredient Technology makes cherry flavoring.  (Gotcha there, <br>
didn't I?)  Ferric ferrocyanide is a by-product of cherry flavoring, and can <br>
be used to make hydrogen cyanide, a nice poison gas for the Kurds and whey.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Well, guess who got the contract to covertly deliver all this stuff<br>
to Iraq?  Wackenhut, naturally.  (Those boys are famous out here in Nevada, <br>
on account of guarding Area 51 and such like research facilities.  It's a<br>
weird scene out here.  Between Reno and Las Vegas off highway 95 they got <br>
the * Naval Undersea Warfare Center *.  In the middle of the desert!  It's  <br>
a nuclear bunker for nuclear-armed torpedos and such.  If that mother ever<br>
goes up, it'll leave the nearby town of Hawthorne flat as a Dow Corning<br>
breast implant.  They'll be breathing Hawthorne molecules from here to <br>
Tonopah.)  <br>
<p>
<p>
      If you find all this nuclear stuff too confusing, you might try<br>
stealing a copy of the * President's Daily Brief * which covers the most<br>
significant information from the previous day, including info from the<br>
nation's most sensitive sources.  I'm sure your better-financed enemy <br>
nation will pay top dollar for a copy passed along daily.<br>
<p>
      Whatever you do, don't get any legal advice from the NSA.<br>

               THE PURPLE-BLUE BRILLIANCE OF TOTAL NOW...<br>
  <br>
     "Dim and yellow against the vibration of the purple-blue shudders the <br>
  faltering light that stands on the tiles of Hidden Lion.  And here is <br>
  Questing the death-hound,  here is Elijah for whom Firouz has opened the <br>
  door, here is Messiah following on Elijah,  here is the giant Bohemond <br>
  foul and stinking with excrement that stains his scarlet cross as he <br>
  stands on Hidden Lion  lifting his sword vertically with both hands and <br>
  plunging it up and down like a man breaking ground for a post-hole.  All <br>
  around him are broken tiles  and among them are heaped gold and silver <br>
  coins that were mortared into the tiles.<br>
<p>
<p>
     Now I see what I have seen before in the darkness and the brightness <br>
  in my mind,  I see leaping and still like a butterfy transfixed by <br>
  lightning the elegance of Bembel Rudzuk as he attacks Bohemond; I see <br>
  the great Frankish sword that has been going up and down like a <br>
  post-hole digger suddely leap like a *live thing* as Bohemond shifts his <br>
  grip,  and now a track of brightness horizontally cleaves the darkness, <br>
  cleaves the body of Bembel Rudzuk;  now in two pieces falls the body of <br>
  Bembel Rudzuk;  now in two pieces falls the body of Bembel Rudzuk to the <br>
  broken tiles of Hidden Lion.<br>
<p>
  <br>
  Here now before me is Bohemond.  This is the great moment when I shall <br>
  see the man who has become my world and my Jerusalem.  His fouled and <br>
  stiuking mail shirt glitters in the purple-blue luminosity of Total Now, <br>
  his helmet flashes as if wreathed in lightnings;  the iron nasal of <br>
  his helmet makes other than human this face I strain to see  but I <br>
  cannot,  I shall never see it,  I see instead the face of that veiled <br>
  owl of my childhood.<br>
<p>
<p>
        I raise my arm now, I strike with my sword, I see it shatter like <br>
  shards of ice as the great sword of Bohemond makes a *rainbow* in the <br>
  night,  in the dawn that is coming.  I stare into the brilliance,  I see <br>
  the Virgin and the Lion wheeling in the darkness and the light.  I see <br>
  the sun-points dazzling on the sea,  the alchemy of the triangualar sail <br>
  changing from the hot and dry to the cold and the wet;  I smell the salt <br>
  breath of Bruder Pfortner.<br>
<p>
       But I cannot see Bohemond in this night and dawn of brilliance,<br>
  of purple-blue luminosity.  No, as the great sword makes another <br>
  *rainbow* in the pale dawn where hangs the new moon of Tammuz, the <br>
  last thing that I see with my mortal eyes,  very very high in the <br>
  sky  and circling in the overlapping patterns of the Law,  is <br>
  that drifting meditation of storks that I have known from my <br>
  childhood, each year returning to their wonted place."<br>
<p>
           -- Russell Hoban, 'Pilgermann'; PICADOR [1983].<br>
