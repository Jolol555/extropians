In a message dated 97-11-15 23:48:25 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Hydrogen economy which generates the hydrogen by directly or indirectly<br>
burning<br>
 fossil fuels, either to generate electricity or to farm land for fuel crops,<br>
is a<br>
 huge net inefficiency. You're just moving the pollution and fossil fuel use<br>
 around, not reducing it. Solar and fusion are possibilities, but either one<br>
is<br>
 very capital-intensive and unlikely to pay for itself in a reasonable time.<br>
Guess<br>
 what that leaves? It leaves hypotech (my portmanteau word for hypothetical<br>
 technology} that reforms fossil fuels at the point of use, then feeds _that_<br>
to a<br>
 fuel cell. Some people claim to have it. We'll see. "Pure" H2 technology as<br>
a<br>
 significant base for the economy just isn't in the cards--unless you palm a<br>
few.<br>
 :)<br>

How about hemp oil derived fuel and products?  Im sure you all have heard all<br>
the wonderful things about it?  I believe it can completely replace all<br>
petrol chemicals as well have benefits in a wide array of other things.<br>
 Consult the book "The Emperor Wears no Clothes"<br>
