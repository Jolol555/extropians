    (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
    Keith Cornell, Senior Editor of the NBC program<br>
    Unsolved Mysteries, in response to CNN's  charge <br>
    that Ian Goddard's promotion of the TWA 800 Navy-<br>
    missile theory was a "sham," states that Goddard <br>
    "honestly believed" the theory and held a "fair-<br>
    minded receptiveness to conflicting opinion." <br>
    With that in mind, Mr. Cornell observes:<br>
<p>
       Regardless of political bent, this is<br>
       not characteristic with the sort of<br>
       intransigence one normally associates<br>
       with "agenda"-driven conspiracy advocates.<br>
<p>
    Therefore Goddard is neither fraud nor fanatic.<br>
    Unsolved Mysteries  is  not  out to promote the <br>
    Navy-missile theory; in fact, they did a program <br>
    that was very critical of the Navy-missile theory. <br>
    In his defense of Goddard, Mr. Cornell concludes:<br>
<p>
       In short, while I believe that the<br>
       "Friendly Fire" theory is wrong, I<br>
       have never thought that Ian Goddard<br>
       was deliberately perpetuating a "sham".<br>

<p>
       Although Pierre Salinger was unavailable <br>
       to us during our brief production schedule, <br>
       I contacted you for a possible on-camera <br>
       interview. During our telephone conversation, <br>
       I challenged you on a few key conflicts <br>
       apparent in Salinger's public interpretation <br>
       of the alleged radar photos. It was at this <br>
       point that you began to express doubt in the <br>
       strength of this evidence, and concern that <br>
       Mr. Sallinger had not discussed the photo-<br>
       graphs with you before giving his statement <br>
       to the press. <br>
<p>
       Subsequently, you and I came to a mutual <br>
       conclusion that you were not adequately pre-<br>
       pared to represent the "friendly fire theory" <br>
       on camera, and we chose to proceed using news <br>
       coverage from Salinger's European press con-<br>
       ferences. <br>
<p>
       It seemed to me at the time  that you hon-<br>
       estly believed in your theory, while main-<br>
       taining a fair-minded receptiveness to con-<br>
       flicting opinion. Regardless of political <br>
       bent, this is  not characteristic with the <br>
       sort of intransigence one normally associ-<br>
       ates with "agenda"-driven conspiracy <br>
       advocates.<br>
<p>
       In short, while I believe that the "Friendly <br>
       Fire" theory is wrong, I have never thought <br>
       that Ian Goddard was deliberately perpetuat-<br>
       ing a "sham".<br>

    Hay, not everyone in the major media is out to get <br>
    me. Let's hope that Mr.Cornell does not get fired.<br>
<p>
    I had never seen the actual radar images until I saw<br>
    them on the Paris Match webpage. The radar tapes were <br>
    in the possession of Richard Russell, which is why I <br>
    told Mr. Cornell I was neither ready nor qualified <br>
    to speak on them for his television program.<br>
