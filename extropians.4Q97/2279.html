<i>&gt; 1.Increased atmospheric CO2 causes increased downward IR-flux</i><br>
<i>&gt;   which could possibly lead to a temperature-rise of the biosphere.</i><br>
<p>
On the other hand, increased atmospheric CO2 causes plants to increase<br>
not only their growth, but the ratio of carbon fixing per lb of plant<br>
growth.<br>
<p>
Additionally,  increased equaltorial heating (where more of these<br>
greenhouse effect measurements are taken, on a per square mile basis,<br>
than in polar regions) tends to reduce the efficacy of the thermohaline<br>
conveyor system in the oceans. The Atlantinc conveyor is known as the<br>
Gulf Stream. As this conveyor system slows, there will be less heat<br>
transport to the poles, leading to colder temperatures in polar regions,<br>
which I needn't further explain, is what causes ice ages.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.In 1958 a downward trend in the relative concentration of radioactive</i><br>
<i>&gt;   C14 was discovered by Suess and attributed to burning of fossile carbon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.In 1970 a clear upward trend of atmospheric CO2 was shown by</i><br>
<i>&gt;   measuraments begun in '58 all over the world.</i><br>
<p>
And yet we have seen nowhere near the same level of temperature increase<br>
relative to CO2 rise as that seen in prehistoric data gathered from ice<br>
deposits. THis says that there must be some other mechanism in charge of<br>
major cooling/warming trends.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.Over a 18.000 year period the CO2 concentration increased from about</i><br>
<i>&gt;   190 PPM to 280 PPM and then suddenly increased to it's present value</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of 365 PPM over the last 200 years.</i><br>
<p>
200 years? You mean 20 years. According to my geologist cousin, the CO2<br>
level's effect on global average temperature has a diminishing returns<br>
effect that kicks in at 280 and really flattens out at 330 ppm. After<br>
that it really doesn't have that much of an effect if it goes up<br>
further. <br>

ice ages.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5.During the latter half of this century there has been a solid</i><br>
<i>&gt;   correlation between economic growth and increased consumption of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   fossile fuels, were increase in fuel usage is tyically 1-3% greater</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that economy growth in that year.</i><br>
<p>
No, there is a solid correlation between per capita income and<br>
pollution, but it is not linear. It starts out linear at $0 up to<br>
$10,000.00 per year, then drops down by 50% by $12500.00, and slowly<br>
dropping further thereafter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 6.Right now the developed nations are consuming a disproportionate part</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the global energy resources (the US consumes a 25% of all fossile</i><br>
<i>&gt;   fuels produces while comprising only 5% of the global population).</i><br>
<p>
This is always a statistical lie tossed out by developing countries to<br>
make the US shoulder the burden like a Sugar Daddy. They fail to say<br>
what percent of that 25% of all fossil fuels is not burned, but is<br>
converted into plastics and other products. THey also fail to properly<br>
account for Chinese coal consumption. This figure is a highly classified<br>
state secret (the true figure at least). They also fail to recognise<br>
that the US long ago reached fill utilization of hydro resources, and<br>
leads the world in implementation of wind and solar projects. They also,<br>
with the exception of France, fail to mention that the only way for the<br>
entire world to solve its fossil fuel dependency is to fully use nuclear<br>
power.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 7.All humans living in Africa, Asia and the rest of the world have</i><br>
<i>&gt;   just a much right to drive cars, have a TV and airconditioning but</i><br>
<i>&gt;   if they do the global energy requirement will increase by (at least)</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a factor of 5. Currently the known supplies of oil/gas are only</i><br>
<i>&gt;   sufficient for 25-50 years (depending on your growth scenario) at</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the current consumtion level.</i><br>
<p>
Your second statement is an utter falsehood, while your first is<br>
inaccurate. The advantage of following our lead is that they will be<br>
able to take advantage of energy and fuel efficient technologies from<br>
the start that were developed by the US. The current fuel reserves, as I<br>
have repeatedly informed this list in the past, is merely a measurement<br>
of known available reserves that are cost effective to recover at<br>
TODAY's market prices. Previously unknown reserves are being discovered<br>
every day, so much so that, depending on growth scenarios you use, we<br>
have somewhere between 200-400 years of KNOWN fossil fuels available.<br>
THis is not even considering the vast hydrate reserves under the ocean<br>
bottoms that were only discovered to exist a couple of years ago. How<br>
much oil and gas remains to be discovered is still an unknown.<br>

<i>&gt; went wrong! The fact that mistakes have been made by certain people</i><br>
<i>&gt; studying these issues in the past doesn't mean there can't be (and hasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; been!) progress in this field.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;warming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please state _one_ scientist whose work has been under the same scrutiny of</i><br>
<i>&gt; peer-review as IPCC publications that dares to stake his reputation on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorie that the CO2-increase of the last 200 years is preventing another</i><br>
<i>&gt; ice-age.</i><br>
<p>
A large number have in the past published, and had reviewed, data on<br>
things like the variance in Solar Nutrino Unit (SNU) levels over time,<br>
as well as the fact that current SNU levels, which are a product of<br>
fusion occuring in the sun's core right now (the heat of which will<br>
radiate to the surface within 5,000 years or so) is only 1/4 of that<br>
deemed necessary to sustain the present solar flux levels. THis means<br>
that, if current solar fusion models are accurate (and are no less<br>
accurate than, say, greenhouse effect simulations) then in a few<br>
thousand years, the sun will drop its output by a large fraction. It is<br>
also well recognised that the end of what is known as the "Little Ice<br>
Age" coincides with vast population and industrialisation growth (with a<br>
concurrent increase in CO2 levels). While this (the little ice age deal)<br>
is not currently in scientific or political vogue, in the 70's and early<br>
80's, it was considered to be solid science.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AFAIKT almost every glacier on this planet has been retreating during this</i><br>
<i>&gt; century and the is _no_ indication whatsoever that there's another iceage</i><br>
<i>&gt; around the corner. And even if there was it's not something that is going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to happen in decades but over a period of several milennia.</i><br>
<p>
You fail to mention that the Greenland Ice Cap, which is in reality one<br>
huge glacier, is indeed growing.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And the fact that this argument is never heard in discussions at policy</i><br>
<i>&gt; level might be an indication that it is not taken seriously by the broad</i><br>
<i>&gt; community of scientists (even PR-people of big oil companies _never_ use</i><br>
<i>&gt; this argument!).</i><br>
<p>
Of course not. you fail to understand the economics of energy prices.<br>
Tell me, when did oil companies make the biggest profits????? Duh, when<br>
prices were sky high during the OPEC stimulated and Carter induced oil<br>
crunch of the 70's and 80's. If energy taxes take effect, this will<br>
increase prices, which will increase their margins, allowing oil execs<br>
to squeeze in more profits. They also will be able to wangle huge<br>
increases in government subsidies for energy research. Pushing oil shale<br>
scams on the feds was one of the biggest cash cows the oil boys <br>
perpetrated on the US and Canada.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;that you are wrong about the solution. The fundamental need is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;increase the amount of organic matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Trees are stable biomass. It may be that more CO2 'bonding' can be done by</i><br>
<i>&gt; oceanic plankton as was noted by Michael Lorrey. However, these cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than temporary solutions since the global emission of CO2 is</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing exponentialy and will continue to do at least so for some time</i><br>
<i>&gt; (there's a lot more coal to burn).</i><br>
<p>
Not so. As CO2 levels go up along with heat, and hopefully with some<br>
stimulation from sinking a couple thousand obsolete cargo ships (all<br>
that metal rusting stimulates plankton growth), that plankton will<br>
flourish and become a) fishfood, which will become people food, which<br>
will become sludge spread over the barren wastes of the midwest, the<br>
Sahara, etc. and b) precipitating detritus settling on the ocean bottom,<br>
to, over time become methane hydrate deposits.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;If your solution compels poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;people on marginal land to continue the agricultural practices now</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;turning that marginal land into desert, you are being counter-productive.</i><br>
<p>
How about throwing out 100 years of counterproductive waste treatment<br>
"technology" and start spreading sludge over the desert??? There are<br>
companies doing this now in Texas with New York City sludge (grade B<br>
sludge).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have no idea where you got this idea and of course it's also necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; try to foster sustainable land-use in poor countries. This is just a part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a much bigger general education problem. If farmers on the edge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; desert can be educated about these things that will be a very big plus</i><br>
<i>&gt; (just as education about family planning and basic health).</i><br>
<p>
At this point there is little for Mohammed Q. Sixpack in the sourthern<br>
Sahara can do, as the main thing draining usable soil from the desert's<br>
periphery is the sun and the winds. Getting Europe to ship its shit<br>
south would do wonders.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what Clinton</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;proposes US businesses should pay out of their own pockets each year</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to dumping dusts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern oceans, we might</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;solve the problem not only for the US, but for the entire world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've heard proposals to dump animals waste (a lot of that in Europe, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; no-one knows what to do with it) in so-called 'oceanic deserts'. These are</i><br>
<i>&gt; area's in the oceans that do not contain minerals (maily nitrogen) required</i><br>
<i>&gt; for basic plankton life and are mostly lifeless because of it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; introduction of nitrogencompounds could start a whole foodchain that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; bond many megatons of carbon. The high cost seems not to be getting it in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the middle of an ocean but to get is from the farms to the ships, after</i><br>
<i>&gt; that: no problem.</i><br>
<p>
Except for bureaucracy. The EPA, that fountain of wise and informed<br>
environmental protection, has banned New York from dumping its sewage at<br>
sea. Any wonder that local fisheries have plummeted???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The major problem with that claim is that identifiable sources of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;possible error convert it to something on the order of "The global</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;temperature is someplace between two degrees colder and three degrees</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;warmer than a century ago, with the most likely value being half a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;degree warmer."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The statistics are difficult, but if you superimpose temperature data</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerning the last 150 years from Vinnikov, Groveman and sources like CRU</i><br>
<i>&gt; and GISS the similaritiest are striking to say the least (and so is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; upward-trend).</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, there's no certainty yet. I do not think we can afford to wait for</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute, 100% certainty.</i><br>
<p>
Almost all of the data, however, are from stations in temperate,<br>
tropical, or equatorial zones. There is very little data from subpolar<br>
and polar regions to give such statistical pools the proper balance. As<br>
a result the stats are merely measuring an increase in equatorial<br>
temperatures, while the decrease in polar temperatures are swamped to<br>
insignificance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The other problem is that to the extent that we can track WHEN this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;change occurred, it appears that about 80% of the effect occurred</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;*before* 80% of the alleged cause.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; X-cuse me? The relation between increased CO2 matches the start of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; industrial revolution and the relative decreasing C14 concentration</i><br>
<i>&gt; correlated with statistical data on global usage of fossile carbon. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; is very little doubt were all this 'new' carbon comes from, the extent of</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's effect cannot be determined yet but there are many indications that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the consequences for the global food production (amongst many other things)</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be a big problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; How can we say that? There was a happy ecosystem, yes. There was</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; not a happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to live near</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;No significant evidence of major change in swamp area as a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;temperature changes in this range. No significant evidence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;non-trivial shoreline changes. No significant evidence of changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;flooding patterns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not yet, but that may very well be because there's a delay between cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; and effect (not unusual in large systems). A two degree temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in the sub-tropics could very well enlarge the habitat for</i><br>
<i>&gt; malariamosquito's causing 50 million additional deaths yearly (mainly in</i><br>
<i>&gt; third-world countries). Already research in Colombia, Ethiopia, Pakistan</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Papua-New-Guinee has shown that malaria is becoming more frequent in</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher area's, this could be greenhouse-related.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, wrong again. Turns out that malarial mosquitos live in swamps<br>
that are a) not given a decent through flow of water, and b) protected<br>
from incursions of salt water. It is the opinion of many current<br>
wetlands experts (as seen in last months AUDOBON issue) that malarial<br>
mosquitos are a sign of an unhealthy wetlands ecosystem. Healty wetlands<br>
have well rounded populations of mosquito predators.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;DIFFERENT plants grow well, but the basic level</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;of biodiversity is not significantly affected.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From what I've understood Homo Sapiens is the biggest threat to biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; diversity since whatever killed the dino's. Normal development of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; eco-system is replacement of about one species per year (based on fossile</i><br>
<i>&gt; records). Current extinction rate is anywhere from 10 to 40 species per</i><br>
<i>&gt; _day_. But all this not not necessarily related to greenhouse (more with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the McDonalds burger farming on poor Brazilian soil and the western lust</i><br>
<i>&gt; for tropical wood).</i><br>
<p>
 Granted, as top predators, we are getting more irresponsible, but this<br>
is mostly because of the preference of many to descend to the level of<br>
cattle in order to be able to increase population.<br>
