To say nothing of the land and resources wasted in suburbs built catering<br>
to car culture, the isolation and cultural vacuum of suburban life, the<br>
destruction of city communities, and the annual traffic deaths of millions<br>
of humans and other animals.  Then there's the fact that, by owning and<br>
relying on a car, you're giving tacit support to the lovely, highly<br>
extropian oil and automobile industries (propped up by federal subsidies<br>
in the US), and heaven forbid that the government shouldn't use military<br>
force to keep oil cheap!<br>
<p>
Sure, driving is a convenience; so is stealing money instead of working<br>
for it.  Why does car culture always make me think of government?<br>
<p>
Sure, driving is fun and hard to give up once you've made it a part of<br>
your life; so's heroin.<br>

Well, all the big car companies, from Volvo to GM, are working on hyrdogen<br>
cell cars.  Petroleum may be a limited resource, but there's a great deal<br>
of hydrogen out there.<br>
<p>
Cars belong in the countryside, not in cities and towns.  <br>
