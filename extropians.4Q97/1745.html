<i>&gt; &gt; We need your help in finding a good name.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something in Latin (or Ancient Greek perhaps).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something that will be clear to the public.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something that will be easy to remember.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something great like Extropy or Excedo (but different).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Something that will stand the test of time!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      (at least until the Singularity)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Has anyone suggested the name "Daedalus"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've always thought it was an intriguing name to begin with, but in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism, it has some significance. As most schoolkids are familar with,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Daedalus was the mythic Greek scientist who, while imprisoned by King Minos on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Crete, fashioned wings of wood and wax for himself and his young son to escape</i><br>
<i>&gt; to freedom. The parallels with transhuman technology are pretty clear, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; story also reminds us that it is possible to become intoxicated by our</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological freedom, and behave irresponsibly (the story of Icarus).  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to blend nicely the desire to free ourselves from normal existence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the need to keep ourselves accountable to ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Plus it's Greek.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Plus it's clear to the public.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Plus it's easy to remember.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It has no "ex-" anywhere in it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And it's stood the test of time thus far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Only problem is, it's so recognizable, that I bet somebody's used it already.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But hey, better an enemy outside the fold than within....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The only thing I don't like about it is that Deadalus failed...<br>
<p>
Prometheus is more apt, but taken by the cryonics people.<br>
<p>
I would suggest Arcadians or Hesperians....<br>
