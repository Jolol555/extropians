<p>
I don't fully agree with your discussion, although I believe that it<br>
is intended to be a somewhat simplified discussion of the issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	The problem of what it would be like is similar to the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; of other minds.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "what it would be like".  It seems quite<br>
easy to me to imagine what it would be like to be any of the people<br>
(who are alive) in this experiment (assuming I were the person who was<br>
involved at the beginning).  It is hardly more difficult than it is for<br>
me to imagine what it will be like for me to go to the gym this afternoon,<br>
or undertake any new experience.<br>
<p>
This does not seem similar to the problem of what it would be like to be<br>
another mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course if you are Dup1 you will be extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.</i><br>
<p>
No, I wouldn't, for two reasons.  First, Dup2 would not say such a thing<br>
in those words.  He would recognize that the whole issue of "the real<br>
Dup" is poorly defined in this situation.  He would argue that he had<br>
as much claim to being a continuation of the original as Dup1 does, and<br>
Dup1 would fully agree with him.  Each would recognize the symmetry of<br>
the situation and each would fully agree about the facts.  There would<br>
be no annoyance at the other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even</i><br>
<i>&gt; though Trans2 claims he is the same.</i><br>
<p>
I had the impression that "Trans1 walked into a similar scanning machine".<br>
I would have no objection to being the person who walked into that<br>
scanning machine, so long as the disassembly was quick and painless.<br>
(I'm unclear on the difference between Trans and Trans1.)<br>
<p>
Trans2 would not claim he was the same, because he would know that such<br>
simple-seeming claims rely on our intuition from a world where copying is<br>
not possible, and are inappropriate in this situation.  He would, rather,<br>
claim to have as justifiable a claim to being a continuation of Trans1<br>
as a person who wakes up in the morning does to being a continuation of<br>
the person who fell asleep the night before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you were Trans2 you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1</i><br>
<i>&gt; was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trans.</i><br>
<p>
Assuming you are aware of the workings of the machine, you would know<br>
these things even without having directly consciously experienced<br>
the disassembly of Trans1 (or your own assembly, for that matter).<br>
You would not believe that simple questions about whether you are the<br>
same as someone else have simple answers until you have defined your<br>
terms more precisely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original Dup and Dup1 would equally annoy you by claiming he was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; real Dup.</i><br>
<p>
There would be no annoyance, as I described earlier.  Both parties are<br>
fully informed and agree about the situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	The primary answer is, if you are the same, you will not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to tell the difference between the two, including the particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; feelings and memories being felt by the two now separate copies.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you were dup1, you would feel exactly the same as dup2.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that the concept of trying to tell the difference between<br>
the two (from the inside!) is meaningful.  It calls to mind an image<br>
in which our consciousness first exists inside dup1, then flies over<br>
to the inside of dup2 where we poke around and see whether things seem<br>
about the same or not.<br>
<p>
Actually each of dup1 and dup2 has their own fully integrated<br>
consciousness.  They start off in the same state and immediately begin<br>
to diverge.  I am sure we all agree about this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	"Then what is it that is you?" one may ask.  I believe, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; your state or shape.</i><br>
<p>
This definition has a couple of problems.  It is a bit misleading to use<br>
the term "shape" because that often refers to the external boundaries of<br>
your physical being, in other words, the shape of your body.  Your term<br>
"state" is more reasonable, but the problem is that the state is constantly<br>
changing.  "You" can't be defined as any one state, or else you would<br>
only be you for one tiny instant.  You need to describe what kinds of<br>
variation of the state are permissible in order to still have it be "you".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Dup1 and Dup2, after living a day, their state would start to</i><br>
<i>&gt; diverge.</i><br>
<p>
Their state would start to diverge instantly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hence, they would become different people.  This would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar to the way you are different than the you that existed</i><br>
<i>&gt; yesterday because of your new memories and other changes.  To the</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree that we are the same as our parents, we are the same person.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To the degree that we are in a different state, we are different</i><br>
<i>&gt; people.</i><br>
<p>
I was following this OK until you mentioned our parents.  We are not the<br>
same people as our parents.  This is not at all analogous to the way that<br>
we are the same people as we were yesterday.  There is no continuity of<br>
brain state from parent to child, among humans.  Maybe this analogy could<br>
work with a race which reproduced by fission, like amoebas, or like we<br>
will become once uploading or duplication is possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	One of the primary reasons we are unsatisfied with such an</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer has a lot to do with the philosophical "problem of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds".</i><br>
<p>
For myself, the answers I find are completely satisfying, and I don't<br>
see that it has much to do with the problem of other minds.  Since we<br>
are dealing with duplicates, the minds at the moment of duplication or<br>
identical and there is no otherness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We simply can't "eff" what it is like to be us, and we</i><br>
<i>&gt; thereby can't know if our copy is really indistinguishable from</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
Not sure what "eff" means here, but if it refers to some form of<br>
perception, it is odd that you would claim that we can't tell what it is<br>
like to be us.  Most people would say the opposite, that we can *only*<br>
tell what it is like to be ourselves, but that we can't tell what it is<br>
like to be someone else.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe the copy is some unfeeling (or "absent qualia")</i><br>
<i>&gt; zombie simply acting the same?</i><br>
<p>
No more reason to suppose that than to suppose that I am a zombie.  The<br>
duplicate is structurally identical to me.<br>
<p>
Besides, nobody takes seriously the prospect that other people are<br>
zombies.  This is not what I think of as the problem of other minds.<br>
Rather, that is the problem of what it is qualitatively like to be someone<br>
else, how their sense of self differs from our own.  Again, in the case<br>
of a duplicate we have every reason to believe that at the moment of<br>
duplication the qualia are in fact identical for the two duplicates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we can solve the problem of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds by discovering what qualia and consciousness really are</i><br>
<i>&gt; objectively we can eliminate such dilemmas or "conundrums", or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "paradoxes".  We simply must be able to "eff" the ineffable.  Such</i><br>
<i>&gt; (mind melding?) will solve all these problems.</i><br>
<p>
It's not clear to me how mind reading or mind melding would really solve<br>
anything related to duplications.  I suppose it would put to rest the<br>
fears that other people may be zombies, but that is not something I take<br>
seriously.  It would presumably also confirm that the mental states at<br>
the moment of duplication are matches, which would certainly be expected<br>
given that the brain states are the same.  It would therefore rule out some<br>
bizarre nonphysical theories of brain behavior (like God breathing our<br>
thoughts or something), but these are unlikely to be taken seriously<br>
even without mind reading.<br>
