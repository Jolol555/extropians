One can understand that there are inequalities of wealth, luck, position,<br>
etc., etc., and that you might want to even those out.  But why call<br>
this a matter of *justice* rather than matter of plain old inequalities<br>
of wealth, luck, position, etc., etc?<br>
<p>
Are we to take it that the produce of society as a whole is controlled<br>
(and/or should be controlled) by some central authority - and that we<br>
have social injustice because that entity isn't doing its job (of<br>
distributing the produce of society equally) right?  <br>
<p>
In response to this it must be remarked first of all that, as a matter<br>
of plain old justice, the produce of society is already owned by the<br>
individuals who produce it, and not by any central authority.  Secondly,<br>
I don't see how the central authority can escape the charge of<br>
arbitrariness.  <br>
<p>
The purpose of law as usually understood is to keep the peace, to<br>
resolve disputes, etc.  This is a *procedure* for which an objective<br>
standard is needed. Why does the law now *also* have to be used as a<br>
tool to do this totally *different* job (which has no objective standard)<br>
of evening out social inequalities?  The one is a formal procedure, the<br>
other is a substantive, utilitarian action: why mix them?<br>
<p>
The thing about injustice is that it requires a perpetrator.  In the<br>
case of the inequalities you mention, there is no perpetrator, precisely<br>
because those injustices are *unintended* consequences of (usually) perfectly<br>
just social interactions.<br>
<p>
It was nobody's intention that people vary in the degree of power they<br>
have over the world and themselves; so there is nobody to catch, bring<br>
into a legal system, and punish.<br>
<p>
Seems to me that the whole purpose of this concept is to justify the<br>
initiation of force to attain one's preferred social distribution.  Only if a<br>
matter is legal is the use of force generally seen as justified, so<br>
social inequalities have to be insinuated to be something like the<br>
result of a kind of "injustice" in order to have the use of force to sort<br>
them out justified.  Quite frankly, this stinks.  In a legally free and<br>
just society, social inequalities, inequalities in power, are *ACCIDENTAL*.<br>
Therefore they require not a legal remedy but concerted remedial action<br>
*within the law*, in the sense of justice as ordinarily understood.<br>
<p>
Better simply to say that you see people born with unequal chances, or<br>
whatever, and appeal to peoples' sense of decency to do as much as they<br>
can to even things out voluntarily.  This sense of decency isn't a sense<br>
of injustice except to the wooliest thinkers, but simply a desire to<br>
lend a helping hand.<br>
<p>
With regard to government, the best thing the government can do is<br>
catalyse voluntary solutions, and then only in the direst emergency<br>
"fill in the gaps".<br>
<p>
Due to legitimate expectations, we couldn't move to a system like this<br>
immediately, but it ought to be the ideal we move towards.<br>
<p>
There is actually a tremendous amount of good-will out there in the<br>
world.  All people need are efficient, workable channels for them to<br>
pour their hearts down.  "Social justice" seekers ought, IMHO, to devote<br>
their undoubted passion and good will to creating such channels (with<br>
the *just* help of government, where necessary) rather than worrying the<br>
fabric of the economic system with pseudo-legal solutions to a pseudo-legal<br>
problem.<br>
