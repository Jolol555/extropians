Hi!<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
Joao Pedro &lt;jpnitya@mail.esoterica.pt&gt; asks<br>
<i>&gt;: Isn't a discussion an exchange of information and ideas?</i><br>
<i>&gt;: How can you have a discussion in the first place without</i><br>
<i>&gt;: different ideas and opinions?</i><br>
<p>
Anton Sherwood replied:<br>
<i>&gt;How can two biologists exchange information about life in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cambrian era, if they're constantly interrupted by biblical</i><br>
<i>&gt;literalists saying there never was a Cambrian era?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we want to discuss our ideas with others who strongly disagree,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there's a forum for that, too: it's called Usenet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Look for me on dejanews)</i><br>
<p>
I agree 100%<br>
<p>
What I disagree is with your "argument" that because you have money you are <br>
an extropian and can join the list while I can't. The simple fact that you <br>
have money - 95$ - to spend makes you nothing better than anyone else in <br>
discussing any issue in the world. And since basically that's what you are <br>
trying to do, I'm expressing my disagreement. All I said was as simple as <br>
that, I disagree with prejudices based on wealth! I disagree when you say <br>
that you are more "qualified" to discuss extropianism because you have more <br>
wealth!<br>
<p>
See ya,<br>
