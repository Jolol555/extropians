OK, so you were using satire.  Ha ha.  But recognizing satire requires<br>
knowing the author well enough to realize that it's out of character, and<br>
not recognizing it doesn't necessarily imply anything about the reader,<br>
other than the reader doesn't know you well enough to know whether you're<br>
kidding or not.<br>
<p>
I apologize for using some "ad hominem" language in my reply to you.<br>
It *did* seem so off-the-wall that I concluded you were just a nutcase.  <br>
(Mind you, the question could still still open. :-)<br>
