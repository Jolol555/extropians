<i>&gt;I hesitate to ask...and if I had reliable Web Access I would not...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But would someone mind expanding upon the "Nolan" Chart as mentioned earlier?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Here are the questions I've seen (20% for each on each axis):<br>
<p>
Are you a self-governor on PERSONAL issues?<br>
                                                        YM N<br>
Military service should be voluntary. (No draft)<br>
Government should not control radio, TV, the press  or the Internet.<br>
Repeal regulations on sex for consenting adults.<br>
Drug laws do more harm than good. Repeal them.<br>
Let peaceful people cross borders freely.<br>
<p>
Are you a self-governor on ECONOMIC issues?<br>
                                                               YM N<br>
Businesses and farms should operate without govt.  subsidies.<br>
People are better off with free trade than with  tariffs.<br>
Minimum wage laws cause unemployment. Repeal them.<br>

World's Smallest Political Quiz.<br>
<p>
What stands between you and reliable Web access?  Not being able to<br>
get to the Web sometimes doesn't sound like any fun.<br>
