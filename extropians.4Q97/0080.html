<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Anarchists would never claim that forcing someone to give up property is<br>
acceptable. While someone may claim to be an anarchist while espousing a<br>
"whats mine is mine and whats yours is mine if I need it" philosophy,<br>
they do not fit the term. Forcing someone who has invested in the<br>
construction of a building with money earned and saved to give up<br>
partial or whole use of that facility as they see fit is theft. That a<br>
bunch of free loaders have latched onto an Orwellian doublespeak sound<br>
bite as a rationalisation of their own theiving proclivities does not in<br>
any way make them anarchists.<br>
<p>
The only opposition a true anarchist would truly have to property<br>
ownership would be if large property owners are using their wealth to<br>
enforce a mercantilist economic system on a free market via political<br>
influence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mark Grant's retort that the empty office buildings are guarded by</i><br>
<i>&gt; zoning laws was a rather more effective defense of capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For more hard-nosed extropians... these issues are related to</i><br>
<i>&gt; homesteading.  How _will_ property in space (favored orbits, asteroids)</i><br>
<i>&gt; be allocated?  If someone sends out loyal von Neumann machines to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'homestead' all of Mars, should[1] we acknowledge the claim?</i><br>
<p>
According to old international law that predates the socialist inspired<br>
Moon and Space Treaties, as well as US minimg and homestead laws, any<br>
uninhabited, unclaimed, unimproved property can be claimed so long as<br>
the claimant "improves" the property in some way. THis may be as little<br>
as adding a radar reflector or a transponder to a body, or as much as<br>
strip mining or terraforming, but the first minimum step in claiming a<br>
plot of land and improving it is simply going there and surveying and<br>
staking the property. For this reason, the gentleman in California who<br>
is selling property on the moon is doing so without even a minimum<br>
improvement, and therefore has not claim to the land. He is using NASA<br>
survey data to plot out lots, so he isn't even performing the survey<br>
himself or by his agent. On the other hand, before he started, he filed<br>
a claim of the moon with the US government, and since they have not<br>
responded withing 90 days of the claim, legally he could have a real<br>
claim on the property, given that the US as a soverign power has<br>
previously claimed the moon.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you just said "yes", will you acknowledge NASA doing the same thing?</i><br>
<p>
In 1969, Neil Armstrong claimed the moon "for all mankind" and set a US<br>
flag on it, and set up several science gathering stations. In court,<br>
this could possibly stand as an improvement. The only remaining question<br>
is how much land is allowed per claim. Since Columbus claimed the whole<br>
new world for Spain, and Spain had to give up Brazil under a treaty set<br>
by the Pope, while England and other settlers were, for all legal<br>
purposes, claim jumpers, but Spain was never able to fully enforce their<br>
claim due to their losses to Francis Drake. On the other hand,<br>
individuals were only allowed so many acres per claim under the<br>
Homestead Act. I guess since Armstrong would more resemble Columbus than<br>
Billy Joe Homestead, due to his officers commision by a sovreign power,<br>
he could possibly be used to claim the entire moon for the US, and<br>
considering that the US has not and will not sign the Moon Treaty, all<br>
they need to do is have the military capacity in space when the time<br>
comes to enforce the claim against any claim jumper from another<br>
country.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you said "no", how do you justify that?  And if your response has</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything to do with "reasonable use", you just wandered into 'left'</i><br>
<i>&gt; territory.</i><br>
<p>
Abandonment of property is a justifiable cause for condemnation. This is<br>
the basis for so called "squatters rights", where if a property owner<br>
does not have enough of a presence, even having an owners agent oversee<br>
the property enough to keep squatters off the land for a given interval,<br>
then the squatters can claim the land as abandoned. In order for the<br>
property owner to keep the land, he or his agent must be present on<br>
occasion to press trespass charges against squatters, as a form of self<br>
defense against the agression of squatters. If the owner does not press<br>
charges and allows the trespass, then there is an implied permission.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [1] Practically, if someone actually controlled all of Mars like that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we might well have to acknowledge the claim.  This hardly challenges the</i><br>
<i>&gt; claim that "property is theft" -- i.e., property goes to the biggest</i><br>
<i>&gt; muscle or gun -- though.</i><br>
<p>
If property is uninhabited, then who is the land being stolen from? It<br>
then is not theft. The claim that enclosure prevents its use by others<br>
and therefore is stealing it from them is bogus, unless it is abandoned.<br>
Remember, to claim the land, it must be improved, so the property rights<br>
are there not mainly to prevent use of the raw land by others, but to<br>
prevent others from uncompensated use of the property owners<br>
improvements, that the owner paid for with money earned by the owners<br>
means of production. No one can deny an individual the right to earn a<br>
living and save moeny, can they?<br>
