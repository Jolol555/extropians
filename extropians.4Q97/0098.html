Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
	Several days ago one of our correspondents (who will, as a courtesy,<br>
remain nameless) took exception to my providing a general reference and a<br>
suggestion as sources of information on a somwhat minor event described in<br>
the Old Testament rather than providing a specific answer. <br>
<p>
Although I felt that the complaint by our correspondent was more than<br>
slightly sophomoric, after careful consideration I concluded that it would<br>
be helpful and appropriate to provide my fellow Extropians with the<br>
reasoning and the value judgements behind my providing a general point of<br>
reference rather than the specific facts and an exegetic commentary.<br>
<p>
I'd like to think that a good teacher is one who encourages others to do<br>
their own research and thinking. As such, the student -- regardless of<br>
their academic accomplishments -- should be provided with just enough<br>
information as may be necessary to start them on their quest for<br>
information and, ultimately, understanding. Understanding cannot be<br>
taught. Only facts can be taught. By encouraging each student to obtain<br>
the specific facts on their own, initiative and self-actualization is also<br>
encouraged.<br>
<p>
By this method the student learns more than the simple facts. They learn<br>
the values inherent in the accumulation of knowledge (epistemology) and<br>
the need for continuous learning and intellectual evolution.<br>
<p>
