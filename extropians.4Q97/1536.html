<i>&gt; An important moral point. Brin has several alien species in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; books who definitely are less than ideal patrons for their uplifted</i><br>
<i>&gt; species, and a very old system of indenture for uplifted species</i><br>
<i>&gt; ("We made you intelligent, so now you will serve us for a measly</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10,000 years, and then you are free.").</i><br>
<p>
	Ah yes.  I would consider it very immoral for such a species<br>
that uplifted me to not allow myself to adequately pay them back.  If<br>
they didn't let me pay them back it would of corse condemn me to<br>
eternal feelings of inadequacy, indebtedness, guilt... (i.e. hell).<br>
<p>
	How many more years than 10,000 do you think it will take me<br>
to pay back the debt I owe to each and every one of my ancestors which<br>
are directly responsible for my very existence and all the others that<br>
are responsible for getting us as close as we are to when uplifting<br>
will be possible?  Of course including plenty of interest to make up<br>
for the compounded time value of each of their contributions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ask me when I have uplifted myself :-)</i><br>

<i>&gt; You're right, the difference between an unaugmented human and a dog</i><br>
<i>&gt; is trivial compared to the difference between them and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; God. However, the difference between a cat and a God is trivially</i><br>
<i>&gt; small. Could somebody pass me the catnip? :-)</i><br>
<p>
ROTFL... ;)<br>
