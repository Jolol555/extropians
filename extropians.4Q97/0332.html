Interesting, although of course we all know that the infinitely fast<br>
computer doesn't exist anyway.  The point of the thought experiment,<br>
similar to your own, is to focus on the issue of how hard it would be<br>
logically to come up with a method to create intelligence.<br>
<p>
I seem to recall a claim that Eric Drexler had an idea for creating<br>
synthetic intelligence by means of an evolution simulation.  You'd set<br>
up a simulation of something similar to our own laws of physics, give<br>
it initial conditions like the primordial earth, and just wait while<br>
life and then intelligence evolve.  Supposedly he had calculated that<br>
a practical quantity of nanocomputers could re-create the entire<br>
evolution of life on earth in a reasonable amount of time.  Then maybe<br>
you run it for a few more minutes and get super-human intelligence.<br>
<p>
(Of course what would really happen is, once the AIs reach human level<br>
intelligence, they'll stop getting smarter and instead create their own<br>
nanotech simulations to evolve their own super-smart AIs.  But those<br>
simulated AIs won't get beyond human level either, they start up a<br>
simulation, etc., etc.)<br>
<p>
I haven't been able to find the exact description of Drexler's idea,<br>
but I think it was on this list sometime in the last few years.  Does<br>
anybody remember this?<br>
