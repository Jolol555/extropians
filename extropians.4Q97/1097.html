       <br>
Because observation is not important to your theory there is no way to <br>

         <br>
1) The 2 slit interference experiment.<br>
<p>
2) Heat up an iron bar, it glows with a blackbody spectrum, the electrons do    <br>
   not spiral into the nucleus.<br>
<p>
3) The quantum well LASER in your CD player.<br>
<p>
4) The Michelson Morley experiment.<br>
<p>
5) Gravitational redshift.<br>
<p>
6) The detection of gravity waves by Taylor and Hulse for which they won the   <br>
   Nobel Prize in 1995.<br>
<p>
Just curious but is there anything special about the number 6?<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Aspect proved experimentally that Bell's inequality is violated and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;that means weird quantum effects that move instantly and  do not         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;neither energy nor information I don't see the relevance to the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Big Bang or General Relativity.</i><br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;You fail to understand the problem, then.  Once you say that two       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;events are absolutely (not relativistically) simultaneous, you have       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;'position space.'  Special and General Relativity _cannot survive_       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;the loss of relativististic simultaneity.        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You can't use these weird quantum effects to make your clock and define time <br>
because you could find a relationship between any two instances in time with  <br>
them, and that means there would be only one instant in time, and that means  <br>
your clock and time itself become useless concepts.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;There are only 2 things known to science that can produce a redshift:       </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt; 1) The Doppler effect.       </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt; 2) Gravity. (an effect discovered by Einstein by the way)</i><br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;Never seen a sunset?  Filters?  etc. etc. etc...  &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
<p>
All a red filter does is absorb blue light and transmit the red, it does not  <br>
shift spectral lines. Do you really think that intergalactic gas can produce <br>
a redshift from X rays to radio waves if the gas is red? Do I really need to  <br>
explain this? <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;Philosophy has priority -- physics used to be known as  'natural       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;philosophy', remember?  </i><br>
       <br>
<p>
Some fields of knowledge are so little understood that we don't even know the  <br>
correct questions to ask, so we can't yet use the full scientific method on  <br>
them. It does no good to tell me not to think about such problems because <br>
they aren't scientific enough, I can't ignore them, the problems are just too<br>
interesting. Physics was once like that, so was Astronomy, and that's why <br>
they were then part of Philosophy, but no more, they have graduated to a <br>
science. <br>
<p>
We just don't know how to use the full scientific method very well on some   <br>
things, not yet, so we do the best we can, it's called philosophy. <br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;in 1970, the American astronomer Robert Henry Dicke suggested a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(partial, 10%) classical cause for the anomaly as due to the         </i><br>
        oblateness of the Sun (a flattening at the poles caused by rotation)<br>
       <br>
<p>
Dicke claimed to have found a very flatten sun, a difference in the diameter  <br>
of 1 part in 2500, and that was 250 times larger than anybody else had ever <br>
found. If true this would indeed be disastrous for Einstein but his results  <br>
are not generally accepted today because nobody has been able to repeat them.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The other planets affect Mercury's rotation.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That obviously must be  included in the calculation and it is. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Light-pressure from sunlight acts on the planets.</i><br>
       <br>
<p>
Yes but that's very small and easily calculated.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Most significantly; the sun's magnetic force transfers the Sun's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;angular momentum to Mercury; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
An even smaller effect. The sun may have most of the mass in the solar system <br>
but the planets have most of the angular momentum.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;general relativity predicts an additional 45" +/-5 per century        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;precession advance         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;If I assert that -- in a gravitational field -- the frequency of a         </i><br>
<i>       &gt;quartz clock slows, due to gravitational force modifying the         </i><br>
<i>       &gt;structure of the  quartz molecules and the electron orbits, that's         </i><br>
<i>       &gt;not the same as saying 'time itself slows down.'        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why not? I say time is what a clock measures, you say time is ... that is to <br>
say, according to your theory time is ..., ah,  ... sorry, I'm stumped.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;You say 'time slows':  I say the clock slows.       </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If this thing you call "time" is not a measure of how particles of matter and  <br>
energy interact, such as the particles in my clock my body my brain or my  <br>
world, then why should I be the slightest bit interest in it? <br>
<p>
You think the logical positivists were foolish because they refuse to say  <br>
things, like atoms, exist because they couldn't directly see them. I think  <br>
your criticism is valid, but then you do something just as bad, you refuse to <br>
say a thing, like time dilation, exists even though you can directly see it.  <br>
Let me hear your own ideas about this, please don't tell me to read yet  <br>
another philosopher's book.      <br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The 'cosmic soup' scatters the starlight, and gravitational         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;accretion reconstitutes the photons back  into stars again.        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What the hell?!     <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's a true 'steady-state' system.  Perpetuum Mobile -- there's 'no         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;way out of the system.'  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sounds dreadful. I thought a static universe gave you the creeps.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>      &gt;No 'entropic heat-death' in this, our Relational Mechanics Universe,       </i><br>
      thank you!  Strike the Second Law of  Thermodynamics...<br>
<p>
<p>
Why would you want to strike the Second Law of Thermodynamics? All it says is <br>
that entropy always increases, nothing pessimistic in that, it would  only be <br>
so if the total amount of information was constant. We'd be in very  bad <br>
shape if Entropy did not increase, that's the very definition of the heat <br>
death of the Universe, but as long as entropy ALWAYS increases infinite life <br>
is possible.<br>
<p>
I know I haven't addressed all the points you raised, but life is too short <br>
to get into a theology debate about what the measurements unmeasurable <br>
photons must have, UFO's, assassination conspiracies theories, water powered <br>
cars or the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.<br>
