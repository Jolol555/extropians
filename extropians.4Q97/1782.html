<i>&gt; Your vision sounds nice, but can it be guaranteed? We live in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; world where things do go wrong, where unexpected things happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; despite precautions and where not everything is done with positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; consequences in mind. Our development is linked with dangers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the future tends to turn out vastly different than our predictions.</i><br>
<p>
	True, but just because some religious people reject technology<br>
all together and are surpassed and made insignificant by the rest of<br>
the technological world, doesn't mean they loose their right to exist<br>
or to need!  We don't go out and kill them or anything just because<br>
they reject technology.  They still own and farm land and do what it<br>
is they want.  Just because our "needs" deal with more technology and<br>
progress doesn't mean their "needs" should be disregarded does it.<br>
<p>
	True we should be cautions and careful.  But why would<br>
anyone's need, no matter what, be thrown out as everyone (man,<br>
machine, transhuman...) else's ability to fulfill their needs are<br>
increased?  If I have a robot that feeds me grapes, why would I want<br>
to suddenly go out and kill some backwards religious person that fears<br>
technology?  It's absurd to think there would be a reson for such<br>
right?<br>
