That was the essense of my arguement.<br>

This is true, but I make two observations:<br>
<p>
1) This is not for a major portion of a life time (and certainly not for<br>
   an extended life-span). It is only done to extend what is clearly the<br>
   terminal portion of their life.<br>
2) In line with 1), these people continue to deteriorate at a rate higher<br>
   than others of their age.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; high altitudes may have increase longevity.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,</i><br>
<i>&gt;leading to a similar oxygen saturation? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it does, at least at high altitudes. (Red cell count always,<br>
lung capacity only if born at high altitudes, I believe.) However,<br>
these things may well not increase proportionately to the amount of<br>
oxygen deprivation. Thus, the cells may also learn to live with less<br>
oxygen and as a consequence have less free radical damage. I simply<br>
don't know if this is true or not.<br>
<p>
One person on the CRSociety list is proposing water restriction instead<br>
of food calorie restriction. If the above idea is true maybe if we all<br>
practiced a little bit of oxygen restriction by breathing less, we might<br>
train our cells to need less oxygen, and consequently produce less harmful<br>
free radicals and make us live longer.<br>
<p>
Though it's an interesting thought, I am the first one to agree that it<br>
make be quite wrong and impractical. <br>
