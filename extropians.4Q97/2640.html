AMERIKA, AMERIKA<br>
 <br>
     by Claire Wolfe<br>
 <br>
Let me run by you a brief list of items that are "the law" in<br>
America today.  As you read, consider what all these have in<br>
common.<br>
 <br>
1. A national database of employed people. <br>
 <br>
2. 100 pages of new "health care crimes," for which the penalty is<br>
(among other things) seizure of  assets from both doctors and<br>
patients.<br>
 <br>
3. Confiscation of assets from any American who establishes<br>
foreign citizenship.<br>
 <br>
4. The largest gun confiscation act in U.S. history - which is also<br>
an unconstitutional ex postfacto law and the first law ever to<br>
remove people's constitutional rights for committing a<br>
misdemeanor.<br>
 <br>
5. A law banning guns in ill-defined school zones; random<br>
roadblocks may be used for enforcement;  gun-bearing residents<br>
could become federal criminals just by stepping outside their doors<br>
or getting  into vehicles.<br>
 <br>
6. Increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and<br>
Firearms, an agency infamous for its  brutality, dishonesty and<br>
ineptitude.<br>
 <br>
7. A law enabling the executive branch to declare various groups<br>
"Terrorists" - without stating any  reason and without the<br>
possibility of appeal.  Once a group has been so declared, its<br>
mailing and  membership lists must be turned over to the<br>
government.<br>
 <br>
8. A law authorizing secret trials with secret evidence for certain<br>
classes of people.<br>
 <br>
9. A law requiring that all states begin issuing drivers licenses<br>
carrying Social Security numbers and  "security features" (such as<br>
magnetically coded fingerprints and personal records) by October<br>
1,  2000.  By October 1, 2006, "Neither the Social Security<br>
Administration or the Passport Office or  any other Federal agency<br>
or any State or local government agency may accept for any<br>
evidentiary  purpose a State driver's license or identification<br>
document in a form other than [one issued with a  verified Social<br>
Security number and 'security features']." <br>
 <br>
10. And my personal favorite - a national database, now being<br>
constructed, that will contain every  exchange and observation that<br>
takes place in your doctor's office.  This includes records of your <br>
prescriptions, your hemorrhoids and your mental illness.  It also<br>
includes - by law - any statements  you make ("Doc, I'm worried<br>
my kid may be on drugs...... Doc, I've been so stressed out lately I <br>
feel about ready to go postal.") and any observations your doctor<br>
makes about your mental or  physical condition, whether accurate<br>
or not, whether made with your knowledge or not.  For the  time<br>
being, there will be zero (count 'em, zero) privacy safeguards on<br>
this data.  But don't worry,  your government will protect you with<br>
some undefined "privacy standards" in a few years.<br>
 <br>
     All of the above items are the law of the land.  Federal law. <br>
What else do they have in common?<br>
 <br>
     Well, when I ask this question to audiences, I usually get<br>
the answer, "They're all unconstitutional."<br>
 <br>
     True.<br>
 <br>
     My favorite answer came from an eloquent college student<br>
who blurted, "They all SUUUCK!" Also  true.<br>
 <br>
     But the saddest and most telling answer is: They were all<br>
the product of the 104th Congress. Every  one of the horrors above<br>
was imposed upon you by the Congress of the Republican-<br>
Revolution --  the Congress that pledged to "get government off<br>
your back."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     BURYING TIME BOMBS<br>
 <br>
     All of the above became law by being buried in larger bills. <br>
In many cases, they are hidden sneak attacks upon individual<br>
liberties that were neither debated on the floor of Congress nor<br>
reported in  the media.  For instance, three of the most horrific<br>
items (the health care database, asset  confiscation for foreign<br>
residency and the 100 pages of health care crimes) were hidden in<br>
the  Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and<br>
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103).<br>
 <br>
     You didn't hear about them at the time because the media<br>
was too busy celebrating this moderate,  compromise bill that<br>
"simply" ensured that no American would ever lose insurance<br>
coverage due to  a job change or a Pre-existing condition.<br>
 <br>
     Your legislator may not have heard about them, either. <br>
Because he or she didn't care enough to do  so.  The fact is, most<br>
legislators don't even read the laws they inflict upon the public.<br>
They read the  title of the bill (which may be something like "The<br>
Save the Sweet Widdle Babies from Gun Violence by Drooling<br>
Drug Fiends Act of 1984").  They read summaries, which are often<br>
prepared  by the very agencies or groups pushing the bill.  And<br>
they vote according to various deals or  pressures.<br>
 <br>
     It also sometimes happens that the most horrible provisions<br>
are sneaked into bills during conference  committee negotiations,<br>
after both House and Senate have voted on their separate versions<br>
of the  bills.  The conference committee process is supposed<br>
simply to reconcile differences between two  versions of a bill. <br>
But power brokers use it for purposes of their own, adding what<br>
they wish.  Then  members of the House and Senate vote on the<br>
final, unified version of the bill, often in a great rush,  and often<br>
without even having the amended text available for review.<br>
 <br>
     I have even heard (though I cannot verify) that stealth<br>
provisions were written into some bills after all  the voting has<br>
taken place.  Someone with a hidden agenda simply edits them in<br>
to suit his or her  own purposes.  So these time bombs become<br>
"law" without ever having been voted on by anybody.<br>
 <br>
     And who's to know?  If congress people don't even read<br>
legislation before they vote on it, why  would they bother reading it<br>
afterward?  Are power brokers capable of such chicanery? Do we <br>
even need to ask?  Is the computer system in which bills are stored<br>
vulnerable to tampering by  people within or outside of Congress? <br>
We certainly should ask.  Whether your legislators were  ignorant<br>
of the infamy they were perpetrating, or whether they knew, one<br>
thing is absolutely certain: <br>
 <br>
     The Constitution, your legislator's oath to it, and your<br>
inalienable rights (which precede the  Constitution) never entered<br>
into anyone's consideration.  Ironically, you may recall that one of<br>
the  early pledges of Newt Gingrich and Company was to stop<br>
these stealth attacks.  Very early in the  104th Congress, the<br>
Republican leadership declared that, henceforth, all bills would<br>
deal only with  the subject matter named in the title of the bill. <br>
When, at the beginning of the first session of the  104th, pro-gun<br>
Republicans attempted to attach a repeal of the "assault weapons"<br>
ban to another  bill, House leaders dismissed their amendment as<br>
not being "germane."  After that self-righteous and  successful<br>
attempt to prevent pro-freedom stealth legislation, Congress people<br>
turned right around and got back to the dirty old business of<br>
practicing all the anti-freedom stealth they were capable of.<br>
 <br>
     STEALTH ATTACKS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT<br>
 <br>
     Three other items on my list (ATF funding, gun<br>
confiscation and school zone roadblocks) were also  buried in a big<br>
bill - HR 3610, the budget appropriation passed near the end of the<br>
second session  of the 104th Congress.  No legislator can claim to<br>
have been unaware of these three because they were brought to<br>
public attention by gun-rights groups and hotly debated in both<br>
Congress and the  media.  Yet some 90 percent of all congress<br>
people voted for them including many who claim to be  ardent<br>
protectors of the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. <br>
Why?<br>
 <br>
     Well, in the case of my wrapped-in-the-flag, allegedly pro-<br>
gun, Republican congressperson: "Bill  Clinton made me do it!"<br>
 <br>
     Okay, I paraphrase.  What she actually said was more like,<br>
"It was part of a budget appropriations  package.  The public got<br>
mad at us for shutting the government down in 1994.  If we hadn't<br>
voted  for this budget bill, they might have elected a Democratic<br>
legislature in 1996 - and you wouldn't  want THAT, would you?" <br>
Oh heavens, no I'd much rather be enslaved by people who spell<br>
their  name with an R than people who spell their name with a D. <br>
Makes all the difference in the world!<br>
 <br>
     HOW SNEAK ATTACKS ARE JUSTIFIED<br>
 <br>
     The Republicans are fond of claiming that Bill Clinton<br>
"forced" them to pass certain legislation by  threatening to veto<br>
anything they sent to the White House that didn't meet his specs. <br>
In other cases  (as with the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill), they proudly<br>
proclaim their misdeeds in the name of  bipartisanship - while<br>
carefully forgetting to mention the true nature of what they're<br>
doing.  In still  others, they trumpet their triumph over the evil<br>
Democrats and claim the mantle of limited  government while<br>
sticking it to us and to the Constitution.  The national database of<br>
workers was in  the welfare reform bill they "forced" Clinton to<br>
accept.  The requirement for SS numbers and  ominous "security"<br>
devices on drivers licenses originated in their very own<br>
Immigration Control and  Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,<br>
HR 2202.  Another common trick, called to my attention by <br>
Redmon Barbry, publisher of the electronic magazine Fratricide, is<br>
to hide duplicate or  near-duplicate provisions in several bills. <br>
Then, when the Supreme Court declares Section A of  Law Z to be<br>
unconstitutional, its kissing cousin, Section B of Law Y, remains<br>
to rule us.<br>
 <br>
     Sometimes this particular form of trickery is done even<br>
more brazenly; when the Supreme Court, in  its Lopez decision,<br>
declared federal-level school zone gun bans unconstitutional<br>
because Congress  demonstrated no jurisdiction, Congress brassily<br>
changed a few words.  They claimed that school  zones fell under<br>
the heading of "interstate commerce."  Then they sneaked the<br>
provision into HR  3610, where it became "law" once again.  When<br>
angry voters upbraid congress people about some  Big Brotherish<br>
horror they've inflicted upon the country by stealth, they claim lack<br>
of knowledge,  lack of time, party pressure, public pressure, or they<br>
justify themselves by claiming that the rest of  the bill was "good".<br>
 <br>
     The simple fact is that, regardless of what reasons<br>
legislators may claim, the U.S. Congress has  passed more Big<br>
Brother legislation in the last two years - more laws to enable<br>
tracking, spying and  controlling - than any Democratic congress<br>
ever passed.  And they have done it, in large part, in  secret.   <br>
Redmon Barbry put it best: "We the people have the right to expect<br>
our elected representatives to  read, comprehend and master the<br>
bills they vote on.  If this means Congress passes only 50 bills per <br>
session instead of 5,000, so be it.  As far as I am concerned,<br>
whoever subverts this process is  committing treason."  By<br>
whatever means the deed is done, there is no acceptable excuse for<br>
voting  against the Constitution, voting for tyranny.  And I would<br>
add to Redmon's comments: Those who  do read the bills, then<br>
knowingly vote to ravage our liberties, are doubly guilty.  But<br>
when do the  treason trials begin?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     BILLS AS WINDOW DRESSING FOR AN UGLY AGENDA<br>
 <br>
     The truth is that these tiny, buried provisions are often the<br>
real intent of the law, and that the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of<br>
pages that surround them are sometimes nothing more than <br>
elaborate window dressing.  These tiny time bombs are placed<br>
there at the behest of federal police agencies or other power groups<br>
whose agenda is not clearly visible to us.  And their impact is felt <br>
long after the outward intent of the bill has been forgotten. <br>
<p>
     Civil forfeiture - now one of the plagues of the nation was<br>
first introduced in the 1970s as one of  those buried, almost<br>
unnoticed provisions of a larger law.  One wonders why on earth a<br>
"health care  bill" carried a provision to confiscate the assets of<br>
people who become frightened or discouraged  enough to leave the<br>
country.  (In fact, the entire bill was an amendment to the Internal<br>
Revenue  Code. Go figure.)<br>
 <br>
     I think we all realize by now that that database of mployed<br>
people will still be around enabling  government to track our<br>
locations (and heaven knows what else. about us, as the database is <br>
enhanced and expanded) long after the touted benefits of "welfare<br>
reform" have failed to materialize.<br>
 <br>
     And most grimly of all, our drivers licenses will be our de<br>
facto national ID card long after immigrants have ceased to want to<br>
come to this Land of the Once Free.<br>
 <br>
     CONTROL REIGNS<br>
 <br>
     It matters not one whit whether the people controlling you<br>
call themselves R's or D's, liberals or  conservatives, socialists or<br>
even (I hate to admit it) libertarians.  It doesn't matter whether they<br>
vote for these horrors because they're not paying attention or<br>
because they actually like such things.<br>
 <br>
     What matters is that the pace of totalitarianism is<br>
increasing.  And it is coming closer to our daily  lives all the time. <br>
Once your state passes the enabling legislation (under threat of<br>
losing "federal  welfare dollars"), it is YOUR name and Social<br>
Security number that will be entered in that employee  database the<br>
moment you go to work for a new employer.  It is YOU who will<br>
be unable to cash a  check, board an airplane, get a passport or be<br>
allowed any dealings with any government agency if  you refuse to<br>
give your SS number to the drivers license bureau.  It is YOU who<br>
will be endangered by driving "illegally" if you refuse to submit to<br>
Big Brother's procedures.  It is YOU whose psoriasis,  manic<br>
depression or prostate troubles will soon be the reading matter of<br>
any bureaucrat with a  computer.  It is YOU who could be declared<br>
a member of a "foreign terrorist" organization just  because you<br>
bought a book or concert tickets from some group the government<br>
doesn't like.  It is  YOU who could lose your home, bank account<br>
and reputation because you made a mistake on a health insurance<br>
form.  Finally, when you become truly desperate for freedom, it is<br>
YOU whose  assets will be seized if you try to flee this<br>
increasingly insane country. <br>
 <br>
     As Ayn Rand said in Atlas Shrugged, "There's no way to<br>
rule innocent men. The only power government has is the power to<br>
crack down on criminals.  Well, when there aren't enough<br>
criminals,  one makes them. One declares so many things to be a<br>
crime that it becomes impossible for men to  live without breaking<br>
laws." <br>
 <br>
     It's time to drop any pretense: We are no longer law-<br>
abiding citizens.  We have lost our law-abiding  status.  There are<br>
simply too many laws to abide.  And because of increasingly<br>
draconian penalties and electronic tracking mechanisms, our<br>
"lawbreaking" places us and our families in greater jeopardy every<br>
day.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     STOPPING RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT<br>
 <br>
     The question is: What are we going to do about it?  Write a.<br>
nice, polite letter to your  congressperson?  Hey, if you think that'll<br>
help, I've got a bridge you might be interested in buying.  (And it<br>
isn't your "bridge to the future," either.)<br>
 <br>
     Vote "better people, into office?  Oh yeah, that's what we<br>
thought we were doing in 1994.  Work to fight one bad bill or<br>
another?  Okay.  What will you do about the 10 or 20 or 100<br>
equally  horrible bills that will be passed behind your back while<br>
you were fighting that little battle?  And let's say you defeat a<br>
nightmare bill this year.  What, are you going to do when they<br>
sneak it back in, at  the very last minute, in some "omnibus<br>
legislation" next year?  And what about the horrors you don't  even<br>
learn about until two or three years after they become law?  Should<br>
you try fighting these laws  in the courts?  Where do you find the<br>
resources?  Where do you find a judge who doesn't have a vested<br>
interest in bigger, more powerful government?  And again, for<br>
every one case decided in favor of freedom, what do you do about<br>
the 10, 20 or 100 in which the courts decide against the  Bill of<br>
Rights?<br>
 <br>
     Perhaps you'd consider trying to stop the onrush of these<br>
horrors with a constitutional amendment -  maybe one that bans<br>
"omnibus" bills, requires that every law meet a constitutional test<br>
or requires all  congress people to sign statements that they've read<br>
and understood every aspect of every bill on  which they vote. <br>
Good luck!  Good luck, first, on getting such an amendment<br>
passed.  Then good luck getting our Constitution-scorning<br>
"leaders" to obey it.     <br>
<p>
     It is true that the price of  liberty is <br>
eternal vigilance, and part of that vigilance has been, traditionally, <br>
keeping a watchful eye on laws and on lawbreaking lawmakers. <br>
 <br>
     But given the current pace of law spewing and<br>
unconstitutional regulation-writing, you could watch,  plead and<br>
struggle "within the system" 24 hours a day for your entire life and<br>
end up infinitely less free than when you begin.  Why throw your<br>
life away on a futile effort?<br>
 <br>
     Face it.  If  "working within the system" could halt tyranny,<br>
the tyrants would outlaw it.  Why do you  think they encourage<br>
you to vote, to write letters, to talk to them in public forums?  It's<br>
to divert your energies.  To keep you tame.  'The system" as it<br>
presently exists is nothing but a rat maze.  You run around thinking<br>
you're getting somewhere.  Your masters occasionally reward you<br>
with a little  pellet that encourages you to believe you're<br>
accomplishing something.  And in the meantime, you are as much<br>
their property and their pawn as if you were a slave.  In the effort<br>
of fighting them on their terms and with their authorized and<br>
approved tools, you have given your life's energy to them as surely<br>
as if you were toiling in their cotton fields, under the lash of their<br>
overseer. The only way we're going to get off this road to Hell is if<br>
we jump off.  If we, personally, as individuals, refuse to cooperate<br>
with evil.  How we do that is up to each of us.  I can't decide for<br>
you, nor you for me. <br>
 <br>
     (Unlike congress people, who think they can decide for<br>
everybody.)  But this totalitarian runaway  truck is never going to<br>
stop unless we stop it, in any way we can. Stopping it might<br>
include any  number of things: tax resistance; public civil<br>
disobedience; wide-scale, silent non-cooperation; highly  noisy<br>
non-cooperation; boycotts; secession efforts; monkey wrenching;<br>
computer hacking; dirty tricks against government agents; public<br>
shunning of employees of abusive government agencies; <br>
alternative, self-sufficient communities that provide their own<br>
medical care and utilities.<br>
 <br>
     There are thousands of avenues to take, and this is<br>
something most of us still need to give more thought to before we<br>
can build an effective resistance.  We will each choose the courses<br>
that are right for our own circumstances, personalities and beliefs.<br>
 <br>
     Whatever we do, though, we must remember that we are<br>
all, already, outlaws.  Not one of us can be certain of going through<br>
a single day without violating some law or regulation we've never<br>
even heard of.  We are all guilty in the eyes of today's law.  If<br>
someone in power chooses to target us, we  can all, already, be<br>
prosecuted for something.  And I'm sure you know that your claims<br>
of  "good  intentions" won't protect you, as the similar claims of<br>
politicians protect them.  Politicians are above  the law.  YOU are<br>
under it.  Crushed under it.  When you look at it that way, we have<br>
little left to lose by breaking laws creatively and purposefully. <br>
Yes, some of us will suffer horrible consequences for our<br>
lawbreaking.  It is very risky to actively resist unbridled power.  It<br>
is especially risky to go public with resistance (unless hundreds of<br>
thousands publicly join us), and it becomes riskier the closer we<br>
get to tyranny.  For that reason, among many others, I would never <br>
recommend any particular course of action to anyone - and I hope<br>
you'll think twice before taking  "advice" from anybody about<br>
things that could jeopardize your life or well-being.  But if we<br>
don't  resist in the best ways we know how and if a good number of<br>
us don't resist loudly and publicly - all of us will suffer the much<br>
worse consequences of living under total oppression.  And<br>
whatever courses of action we choose, we must remember that this<br>
legislative "revolution" against We the  People will not be stopped<br>
by politeness.  It will not be stopped by requests.  It will not be<br>
stopped by "working within a system" governed by those who<br>
regard us as nothing but cattle.  It will not be stopped by pleading<br>
for justice from those who will resort to any degree of trickery or<br>
violence to rule us.  <br>
 <br>
    It will not be stopped unless we are willing to risk our lives,<br>
our fortunes and our sacred honors to stop it.  I think of the words<br>
of Winston Churchill: "If you will not fight for the right when you<br>
can easily win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your<br>
victory will be sure and not so costly,  you may come to the<br>
moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you<br>
and only a precarious chance for survival.  There may be a worse<br>
case.  You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory,<br>
because it is better to perish than to live as slaves."<br>

 <br>
9. (de facto national ID card) Began life in the Immigration<br>
Control and Financial Responsibility Act  of 1996, sections III, II<br>
8, 119, 127 and 133; was eventually folded into the Omnibus <br>

various provisions that make up the full horror of this database are<br>
scattered throughout the bill and  may take hours to track down;<br>
this one is stealth legislation at its utmost sneakiest.<br>
 <br>
     And one final, final note: Although I spent aggravating hours<br>
verifying the specifics of these bills (a  task I swear I will never<br>
waste my life on again!), the original list of bills at the top of this<br>
article was  NOT the result of extensive research.  It was simply<br>
what came off the top of my head when I  thought of Big<br>
Brotherish bills from the 104th Congress.  For all I know,<br>
Congress has passed 10  times more of that sort of thing.  In fact,<br>
the worst "law" in the list -- #9, the de facto national ID card -- just<br>
came to my attention as I was writing this essay, thanks to  the<br>
enormous efforts of Jackie - Juntti and Ed Lyon and others, who<br>
researched the law.  Think of it: Thanks to congressional stealth<br>
tactics, we had the long-dreaded national ID card legislation for  five<br>
months, without a whisper of discussion, before freedom activists began<br>
to find out about it. Makes you wonder what else might be lurking out<br>
there, doesn't it?  <br>
And on that cheery note - THE END. <br>
