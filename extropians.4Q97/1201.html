<i>&gt;&gt; I do try to correct impressions when I can, but if someone is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; content to think I'm an idiot or a jerk based on eir impressions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and doesn't want to hear me argue otherwise, that's eir right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and I just have to live with it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's fine unless the people with the incorrect impressions are</i><br>
<i>&gt; a judge and a prosecutor...</i><br>
<p>
Good point--I suppose it's not paranoia if they /are/ out to get you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps Brin's and my discomfort with cypherpunks is only that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but I think it is more: as I said, in my experience, those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; attach great value to preventing the spread of information about</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; themselves I find strange.  It is not a reasoned judgment, only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; an emotional reaction, but it is a prejudice that serves me.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thank you for explaining this to me, because until now I found</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brin's stance on these issues to be incomprehensibly extreme.</i><br>
<p>
Just for the record, I find the specifics of Brin's arguments<br>
just as incomprehensibly extreme: distrust of those who value<br>
"privacy" and spreading openness memes is one thing; banning a<br>
communication technology is quite another.  Not only irrational<br>
in its goals, but a complete waste of time to even consider as<br>
a possible reality.  It makes about as much sense as gun control<br>
or nuclear weapon bans; yeah, let's just pass a law against the<br>
/things/ and pretend that they'll go away, and pay no attention<br>
to the reasons people do evil with those things.<br>
