<i>&gt;&gt;My concern, in this limited instance, is the hopeful expansion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;legal -- and social paradigm -- to include the understanding that true</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;equity resolutions necessary for the creation of an ideal social order are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;best focused on relieving (or eliminating) a society of as many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;inequities that exist among its members as may be possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One can understand that there are inequalities of wealth, luck, position,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc., etc., and that you might want to even those out.  But why call</i><br>
<i>&gt;this a matter of *justice* rather than matter of plain old inequalities</i><br>
<i>&gt;of wealth, luck, position, etc., etc?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are we to take it that the produce of society as a whole is controlled</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and/or should be controlled) by some central authority - and that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have social injustice because that entity isn't doing its job (of</i><br>
<i>&gt;distributing the produce of society equally) right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In response to this it must be remarked first of all that, as a matter</i><br>
<i>&gt;of plain old justice, the produce of society is already owned by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals who produce it, and not by any central authority.  Secondly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't see how the central authority can escape the charge of</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrariness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The purpose of law as usually understood is to keep the peace, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;resolve disputes, etc.  This is a *procedure* for which an objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;standard is needed. Why does the law now *also* have to be used as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;tool to do this totally *different* job (which has no objective standard)</i><br>
<i>&gt;of evening out social inequalities?  The one is a formal procedure, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other is a substantive, utilitarian action: why mix them?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The thing about injustice is that it requires a perpetrator.  In the</i><br>
<i>&gt;case of the inequalities you mention, there is no perpetrator, precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;because those injustices are *unintended* consequences of (usually)</i><br>
perfectly<br>
<i>&gt;just social interactions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was nobody's intention that people vary in the degree of power they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have over the world and themselves; so there is nobody to catch, bring</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a legal system, and punish.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Seems to me that the whole purpose of this concept is to justify the</i><br>
<i>&gt;initiation of force to attain one's preferred social distribution.  Only if</i><br>
a<br>
<i>&gt;matter is legal is the use of force generally seen as justified, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;social inequalities have to be insinuated to be something like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;result of a kind of "injustice" in order to have the use of force to sort</i><br>
<i>&gt;them out justified.  Quite frankly, this stinks.  In a legally free and</i><br>
<i>&gt;just society, social inequalities, inequalities in power, are *ACCIDENTAL*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore they require not a legal remedy but concerted remedial action</i><br>
<i>&gt;*within the law*, in the sense of justice as ordinarily understood.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Better simply to say that you see people born with unequal chances, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever, and appeal to peoples' sense of decency to do as much as they</i><br>
<i>&gt;can to even things out voluntarily.  This sense of decency isn't a sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;of injustice except to the wooliest thinkers, but simply a desire to</i><br>
<i>&gt;lend a helping hand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With regard to government, the best thing the government can do is</i><br>
<i>&gt;catalyse voluntary solutions, and then only in the direst emergency</i><br>
<i>&gt;"fill in the gaps".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Due to legitimate expectations, we couldn't move to a system like this</i><br>
<i>&gt;immediately, but it ought to be the ideal we move towards.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is actually a tremendous amount of good-will out there in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world.  All people need are efficient, workable channels for them to</i><br>
<i>&gt;pour their hearts down.  "Social justice" seekers ought, IMHO, to devote</i><br>
<i>&gt;their undoubted passion and good will to creating such channels (with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the *just* help of government, where necessary) rather than worrying the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fabric of the economic system with pseudo-legal solutions to a pseudo-legal</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;said Guru George:</i><br>
<p>
Responsa ad hominum<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
There is a problem here that far to many people fail to understand.<br>
Ethically, we must consider the concerns and fates of our fellows if we are<br>
to reduce if not eliminate social inequities. The issue as I see it is to<br>
transcend our selfishness for the common good.<br>
<p>
Can we focus on greater involvement by increasing direct participation in<br>
government and eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome that our so-called<br>
representative government is degenerating into?<br>
