      Hello!<br>
<p>
      My friend jrt@cix wrote to me, after reading my comments to Carl <br>
      Feynman, sayiong that he thought my dismissal of overly mathematical <br>
      treatments of physics was a bit cavalier, and might make it more <br>
      difficult for people to understand what I aim to get across.<br>
<p>
<p>
       It may assist understanding to think about RM like this:<br>
<p>
[A] Take Classical Mechanics: (Start with T.W.B. Kibble's fine text):<br>
[B] Add relational electric and magnetic and gravitational forces:<br>
[C] Add a velocity of force propagation ('c'), which delays far-action:<br>
[D] Add a full ballistic ('particle' or 'photon') theory of EM radiation.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The _basic_ maths is straightforward, although some of the force <br>
      interactions are fiendishly complex to calculate.  That's why we use <br>
      (say) statistically-based approximation methods like Quantum <br>
      Mechanics.<br>
<p>
      There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture' <br>
      approach to physics (i.e. my preference); and the instrumentalist <br>
      reified' mathematical approach.<br>
<p>
      However, my basic thesis is identical to Heisenberg's statement:<br>
<p>
     "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exatly 'right' wherever its <br>
      concepts can be applied." -- Werner Heisenberg.<br>
<p>
<p>
     I propose that that means _everywhere_.   Classical Mechanics is the <br>
     most consistent, conceptually clearest, strongest, most coherent, <br>
     most extendable and most adaptable Scientific Research Programme the <br>
     world has ever seen.  Why use anything else, is all.  "Simplify!  <br>
     Simplify!"<br>
<p>
     I think it's actually _true_. <br>
<p>
     It is certainly exactly accurate to the present limits of <br>
     measurement, AFAICS.  What more can anyone ask for?<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
     Max:<br>
<p>
     On 'Frame Dragging.'  Insofar as gravitational force is propagated <br>
     radially as an intrinsic property of mass, and with a finite <br>
     velocity, we would expect something like 'frame dragging' to occur.  <br>
     Different ways of interpreting the same data, is all.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
     Anton:<br>
<p>
     Electrons held in orbit by a balance of electric force against <br>
     inertia are in a condition which is analogous to 'free fall.' They're <br>
     not accelerating in a way which causes emission of photons. The <br>
     radial distance between the positive and negative charges is <br>
     _constant_, except for the periodic frequency fluctuation as they <br>
     wiggle round in circular sinewave paths at self-equilibrating integer <br>
     frequencies (See Beckmann).<br>
<p>
     If they absorb or emit a photon, they increase or decrease in mass, <br>
     and the orbit adjusts.  If they change theior angular velocity, they <br>
     take up different orbits. The model works perfectly.  Bohr's basic <br>
     [1913] model works by ad hoc postulates, whereby I offer physical <br>
     mechanisms and hence physical explanations.  That makes RM a superior <br>
     theory!  More content!  What's the problem supposed to be?<br>
<p>
     All this 'electrons spiralling into the nucleus' stuff -- this is a <br>
     hangover from aether-drag theory.  There's no point in quoting <br>
     Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a (non-existent) aether to <br>
     transmit forces, whereas RM has relational -- Faradayan -- aetherless <br>
     forces.  See Berkson's 'Fields of Force' on this crucial point (he <br>
     was a postgrad student of Popper's at LSE, BTW).<br>
