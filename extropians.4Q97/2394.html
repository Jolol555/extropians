I forwarded Erik Reid a few choice bits of the conversation going on <br>
re the teleportation, which he enjoyed reading, and he has the <br>
following bit of reply to Wayne Haye's post (and in keeping with <br>
Wayne's lively writing style):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is almost certain that the quantum state of a normal, everyday object</i><br>
<i>&gt;(like a brick, or a human) is completely irrelevant when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;true teleportation.</i><br>
<p>
Almost, but no cigar for the gentleman.  The state of the particle is the<br>
most crucial part of physical properties.  Yes, the raw materials must<br>
exist on the other end in order to do the recreation.  If you are going to<br>
transport the state of a gold atom from point A to point B, you must have<br>
a gold atom at point B in order to have the state transferred.  That's not<br>
even at issue!  This is not a particle beam; this is quantum teleportation,<br>
faster-than-light, which means actual material can by definition not be<br>
transported, only information about the material.  The state of the<br>
particles creates the larger object.  They believe that they'll be able to<br>
transport molecules within 10 years with this method; in that case, you<br>
won't need the molecule at point B, all you'll need is the raw materials of<br>
the molecule to have it recreated.  So the gentleman in question should<br>
be informed that he is incorrect.  And no, no one is suggesting that we<br>
will have the ability any time soon to do a complete dissection and<br>
recreation of an object, but the fundamental theory is there.<br>
<p>
For myself, I think the most exciting part of this is the communcation<br>
aspect more than the object-moving aspect.  If we can communicate<br>
planetary or stellar distances instantaneously, bypassing the light-speed<br>
communication barrier, space travel becomes that much more feasible. <br>
(By the way, that is *not* yet possible with this scheme; while the<br>
transfer is FTL, currently light-speed communication has to take place<br>
around it, so we haven't gotten there yet.)<br>
