<p>
Interestingly enough, I had the same thought. some time ago I created<br>
a list on my box to cover similar issues, and never got around to<br>
announcing it. Here at work we use the term Headspace to describe<br>
mental capacity. When a user does something particulary dumb, we refer <br>
to it as a Insufficient User Headspace Error. So I called the list<br>
'headspace'.<br>
<p>
To subscribe, send an email with just the word subscribe in the<br>
subject to headspace-request@x4.net.<br>
<p>
Submissions will go to headspace@x4.net.<br>
<p>
The original impetus for the list was to discuss ways to enhance<br>
mental performance. I personally would like to know what people out<br>
there know or suggest about Attention Deficit Disorder in adults.<br>
<p>
I'm open to suggestions on a charter, or lack thereof. Someone should<br>
at least write an info file to be sent out at subscribe.<br>
<p>
I can also provide web space for a web page dealing with these issues, <br>
or any &gt;H issues, really.<br>

P.S. - Or, just smack me around and tell me I'm way off base.<br>
