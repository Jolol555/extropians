It's an entry in a database; tomato.red = TRUE. Everything you see<br>
around you is just a database, and Dennet goes to great lengths to<br>
demonstrate this. This is why human perception is so easily fooled,<br>
and why hallucinations may well change a tomato into an elephant,<br>
rather than swapping around bits of the visual field.<br>

Nonsense. He's just saying that the high-level executive software <br>
doesn't realise how the low-level software works and is making false<br>
assumptions about it.<br>

It's an entry in a database. What's a database entry "really fundamentally<br>
and phenomenally like"?<br>
