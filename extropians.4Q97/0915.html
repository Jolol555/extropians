<i>&gt;  Well, I guess it couldnt be attached to one spot on the earth, but maybe to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a track or separate cord that went around the earth, and have enough leeway</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it could stop temporarily at stations along the track to upload supplies</i><br>
<i>&gt; or whatever into the cord connecting to the object in space, well i guess it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have to be a tube.  I dunno how it would get up there, perhaps some</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of suction system .  There's a problem with air resistance too.</i><br>

There are a couple of very good science fiction novels on the subject of<br>
the "beanstalk". The beanstalk is attached to earth at one end and to a<br>
satellite beyond geosynchronous orbit at the other. Since the satellite<br>
beanstalk is trying to pull the satellite at faster than its free<br>
orbital<br>
speed, the satellite exerts a upward force on the beanstalk, keeping the<br>
thing upright.<br>
  The best-known of the books is probably<br>
      the Fountains of Paradise<br>
      Arthur C. Clarke<br>
       (c) 1978, ISBN 0-345-25356-6<br>
Another book was written by another author at about the same time. It<br>
used a different construction technique. I cannot remember the name,<br>
though.<br>
