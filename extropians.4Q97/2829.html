<i>&gt; and replacing it with hope instead.</i><br>
This reminds me of one of my pet ideas: a "retirement community" for <br>
immortalists on a nice little tropical island with private law. The elderly and<br>
terminally ill could finish their lives there (or get well) in comfort (holiday<br>
resort<br>
style living), among like-minded people and with cryonic suspension teams<br>
standing by. You can use any drugs you want to ease the discomfort of<br>
terminal illness (or just for fun), and you can choose euthanasia if things get<br>
unbearable. There are no legal hassles. Planned death of course also means a<br>
(much) better suspension. Bodies of the deceased can be stored on location,<br>
again preventing legal problems (but you'll have to officially become full citizen<br>
of<br>
this island state first, I suppose, so that some moronic relatives supported by<br>
an even more moronic government can't "claim" your body for "decent burial").<br>
Too bad there is no money for something like this...<br>
<p>
P.s: whatever happened to the Oceania Libertarian Island project? Can't get <br>
any useful (up to date) information from their website, and they don't reply to <br>
info-requests...<br>
