Yes I agree....this is exactly why I think I shouldn't do it.<br>
<p>
This means then that you shouldn't really care if or what<br>
they know of you. At the other hand, if you commit a crime,<br>
or you run for office, your a sitting duck :-)<br>
<p>
I also already consider my computer, public domain.<br>
If I don't want it on the net, I should use one that isn't<br>
linked to it. I think this is the only way to be and stay<br>
(privatly) free.<br>
