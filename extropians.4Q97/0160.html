There have been a few posts in this thread containing expressions to the<br>
effect: "Why do people talk about (libertarian) economics and politics and<br>
law so much? None of that will matter when the singularity arrives."  Setting<br>
aside for a moment discussion of just what the (or "a") singularity might be<br>
(I would describe myself as a Reform Singulatarian, I suppose), I believe<br>
that questions of economics, politics and law are all the more important in<br>
the shadow of the singularity.  On the one hand, we should care dearly about<br>
how social systems will speed or retard technological develpment and, on the<br>
other, at the advent of post-humanity we will be in sore need of guidance for<br>
our conduct with enhanced power over nature and each other.<br>
<p>
The measure of our social systems' vitality and freedom will correlate<br>
directly, it seems, to the speed of technological advancement.  More free<br>
exchange of information should correlate to faster technological development.<br>
 A richer and more diverse economy should result in more leisure for the<br>
spreading of tranhumanist ideas.  More fluid legal systems should tranlate<br>
into lower "transaction costs" in the formation and operation of enterprises<br>
for carrying out the transhumanist agenda.  True, these things may well<br>
promise only incremental changes, but such changes have a way of adding up<br>
and, at some point, reaching the stage of qualitative change.<br>
<p>
I don't expect any sort of extropian/libertarian "revolution" prior to the<br>
advent of real post-humaity.  The possibility of conducting experiments on<br>
smaller or larger scales MAY present itself, if anonymous digital commerce<br>
develops far enough before other radical technological transformations occur<br>
(such as nanotechnology or uploading).  If such opportunities present<br>
themselves, we ought to be ready for them, and discussions of economic,<br>
political and legal theory are a good foundation, if we have the chance,<br>
pre-singularity, to implement them.<br>
<p>
However, where these contemporary discussions will really pay great dividends<br>
is in the period immediately following the advent of powerful transhuman<br>
technologies.  Many social systems, the current nation-state among them, will<br>
be significantly undermined if "mature" nanotechnology, significant<br>
intelligence augmentation, artificial superintelligences or widespread, full<br>
uploading come onto the scene quickly.  But the need for social systems won't<br>
evaporate.  On the contrary, social actors with newly augmented powers will<br>
be more than ever in need of reliable and acceptable social systems.  Unlike<br>
engineering and the sciences, TALKING about such things is in fact how social<br>
systems happen.<br>
