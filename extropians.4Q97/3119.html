<i>&gt; Just a small new years greeting to you all.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... Honestly, I can't list all the really important stuff of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1997 since most of it just disappears into the flood of discoveries</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ideas; it is hard to tell the truly relevant from the merely</i><br>
<i>&gt; amazing, and I'm starting to realize that I'm are getting numbed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pace.</i><br>
<p>
Uh oh. If Anders is overloading, we're all in trouble. :)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Overall, I think biotechnology stole the show this year.  If there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a single breakthrough to remember it is Dolly. Not because cloning is</i><br>
<i>&gt; important, but because it showed so clearly that 1) things that look</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard or impossible might be surprisingly simple to do,</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but things that look easy might not be, either, e.g. fusion energy<br>
has been just around the corner for the last 50 years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; future is here *now*. The reactions to Dolly were largely predictable</i><br>
<i>&gt; and shows that we have a long way to go before transhuman ideas can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; accepted in the mainstream.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another thing to remember is the rescue of Mir. Why was it important?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because it shows that we humans are tenacious and will not let go of</i><br>
<i>&gt; our grip on space just because the equipment fails.</i><br>
<p>
Or because the country that built it no longer exists.<br>
Mir presents an interesting oppoertunity for privatization: its <br>
components will (stupidly!) not be used in the new International <br>
Space Station, though the Russians did propose and push for this. They<br>
are accustomed to reusing gear; some of Mir's equipment was salvaged<br>
from<br>
Salyut 7 (?), the previous station, and hence is older than Mir itself.<br>
Mir might be abandoned in place, a fully functioning, proven habitat<br>
only<br>
11 years old. It would make a great construction shack.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Time is too short to list all the fun stuff that is happening in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology direction (cubical DNA, buckytube diodes, monolayers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and NASA making nanotech a serious subject), </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, just what we need, another Space Shuttle (paraphrasing a leading<br>
Caltech dept. head).<br>
Ned Seeman is making octohedral, dodecahedral, and other DNA these days,<br>
with<br>
stronger joints and "tabs" of single-strand DNA at the vertices for<br>
connecting units together.<br>
Carbon nanotubes also make transistors, quantum wires,<br>
variable-electronic-<br>
property devices (depending on how much they are bent), "plumbing"<br>
components (elbows, reducers, tees, crosses, etc.).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any predictions for 1998? </i><br>
<p>
We will see hybrids of silicon/molecular machinery this year.<br>
Lithography-<br>
like (and unlike) processes will produce 10nm features across cm^2 dies.<br>
Light wavelength barriers for photolith will be obviated in the process.<br>
Private rockets will reach free orbit (X-Prize claimed).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Have a great new year!</i><br>
