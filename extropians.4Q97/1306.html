Do a web search on "surreal numbers" and you will find a lot of information.<br>
<p>
I read Knuth's book about Conway's invention twenty years ago, but it was<br>
frustrating.<br>
<p>
He presents it as a story about a guy and a gal vacationing on an<br>
abandoned island who find a mysterious rock with the rules for creation<br>
of these numbers on it, and who spend their time working out the math.<br>
<p>
It was one of those books where the breezy presentation makes you think<br>
everything will be easy, but actually I found the math quite difficult.<br>
Eventually I realized that although I had been following along happily,<br>
I didn't understand it at all.<br>
<p>
Also, there wasn't enough sex in it.<br>
<p>
