<i>&gt; These discussions over European vs. American violence leave out several key</i><br>
<i>&gt; points-</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One-  Europe at various times this century has been very unsafe-  Shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; world war be included in any serious discussion on violence?  What about</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bosnia?</i><br>
<p>
This is an excellent question. While a low level of urban conflict seems<br>
to be a characteristic of American Society, does such a low level act as<br>
a relief valve, while the European tendency toward repression of<br>
conflict simply act to store up the 'pressure' until the time is right,<br>
until the culture is weak, so that widespread violence erupts in war?<br>
<p>
THis century, between 20-50 million people have died in various levels<br>
of conflicts in Europe, yet, even if you apply today's high murder rate<br>
in the US to every year in this century, that only totals 2-3 million<br>
people. Which region is it more dangerous to have lived in this<br>
century???<br>
<p>
Its also obvious by US emigration/immigration data that, on the whole,<br>
the US is still a more attractive place to move to than to move out of<br>
than most other countries. That we have such a big problem with illegal<br>
immigration indicates that poeple much prefer living in the US in a<br>
illegal status than as an upstanding citizen in their own countries.<br>
THis is not just third world countries. SOmeone a bit back cited that<br>
one is more likely to be murdered in the US than in Northern Ireland,<br>
yet why is it that many more Northern Irish immigrate or travel as<br>
tourists to the US than the reverse?? Even if solely US-European stats<br>
are used, it show that more people from Europe wish to go to the US than<br>
the reverse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Second-  We should define precisely who we are talking about-  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; factor in race and location, the difference is startling.  White suburban</i><br>
<i>&gt; America has similar violence rates to Europe-  Of course writing about race</i><br>
<i>&gt; is taboo in American society.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is unfortunate, but indicative of the attitudes of those in power<br>
wishing to perpetuate their constituency than in raising them up, in<br>
order to keep their jobs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Third-  Due to the first Amendment, Americans enjoy a free press-  Canada</i><br>
<i>&gt; as an example censors many lurid crime details from being reported.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; American press' sensational tabloid reporting style doesn't do much for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; American image either-</i><br>
<p>
This is another point relative to my first response here. Why is tourism<br>
to the US so much higher if everyone in other coutnries sees this<br>
country as dangerous?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fourth-  There is a lack of correct historical perspective-  How many of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; have heard about the "Wild, wild west?  Crime rates in the late 1800s in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US were low-  Do you really think that a bunch of civil war veterans on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the western frontier would let a gang terrorize their town?</i><br>
<p>
I think that the "wild wild west" was the first example of the<br>
sensationalist tendencies of the free American press, but I think that<br>
the term came more from the habitat, originally.<br>
