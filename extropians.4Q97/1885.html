I've read many of your posts concerning the brain, uploading, etc. and<br>
without knowing much more about you I consider you very thoughtful<br>
and intelligent. However, society subtley assaults you daily(as it does most<br>

ability in areas as vast as cosmology is. Once again, at the risk of heavy<br>
verbal abuse, I recommend <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com">http://www.neo-tech.com</a> to everyone on this<br>
