In a message dated 97-10-20 20:24:11 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;I saw somewhere a picture where someone had a triangle so it fit<br>
perfectly<br>
<i> &gt;inside the earth, and within that triangle, perfectly, was the moon.  Is</i><br>
the<br>
<i> &gt;earth/moon relationship really like that?  I know the earth has been</i><br>
<i> &gt;expanding over its time and the moon has not, so maybe that relationship</i><br>
<i> &gt;existed in the past, but im really wondering about the present, does anyone</i><br>
<i> &gt;know?</i><br>
 <br>
 By picking an appropriate triangle, you can do that with any two circles of<br>
 any size.  So it's true, but means nothing.<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No you cant, it has to be perfect, or rather it has to be the right ratio.  I<br>
am saying a perfect relationship, with congruent sides, to where the angles<br>
of the triangle touch the earth's circumference at a point and the moon<br>
touches the triangle at a tangent. If the moon was any bigger or smaller it<br>
wouldnt be touching the triangle's side at one point, but rather two or none.<br>
 Im asking if the earth/moon relationship represents this perfect ratio,<br>
either with a plane triangle, or a pyramid.<br>
