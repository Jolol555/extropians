Maybe I should explain it better. If I understand the global<br>
vision of the book right. By natural selection and thanks<br>
to some copy misstakes of the genes (evolution:-) the one's<br>
best equiped stay and the one's who don't go. <br>
But, at some point in the history of this evolution some<br>
genes split....and could only "build" a new copy when <br>
they came back together again (ok a bit alterd).<br>
If I see this right there was a point that "they" both were not<br>
able to evolve alone and had (to evolve all sort of things) to get<br>
back together again. In this period "they" could have been <br>
wiped out.............what am I missing here.........<br>
IMHO it was very tricky to give away the oppertunity to<br>
spread alone!? Of course I accept the "luck" or "random"<br>
factor in this story. But maybe some of you would like <br>
to share their "why" opinions.<br>
