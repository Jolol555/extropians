<i>&gt; Hello Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an e-mail conversation with my micro-economics teaching assistant, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; got onto the subject of the inefficiencies of government as a monopolistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; firm.  I am in no way experienced enough to have a sufficiently informed</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate on this topic-- could someone more learned please help me poke some</i><br>
<i>&gt; holes in his argument(although some points of his are very convincing).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Especially, how do I argue against his statement that public healthcare is</i><br>
<i>&gt; 40% cheaper than private!?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Here are some arguments: <br>
<p>
1) The Canadian health care system averages 40% cheaper than private<br>
health care in the US because a) private health care coverage is taxable<br>
income here in the US b) Canadians fix prices below market demand<br>
levels, thus putting ceilings on the earning abilities of doctors to<br>
earn market rates and c) the most high cost health services in Canada<br>
are highly restricted and rationed, far more than is rational, which is<br>
basically meant to force people to go to the US to have procedures done.<br>
The Canadian claims of 40% do not factor in this externalized cost. If<br>
they did, they would be much closer to US rates. Also, d) tort laws here<br>
in the US encourage excess consuption of health care services merely to<br>
rack up bills to influence liability awards by juries, and to inflate<br>
the costs of malpractice insurance here as opposed to Canadian<br>
malpractice rates.<br>
<p>
You will notice that none of these factors has anything to do with the<br>
actual cost of goods and services, just with the various ways in which<br>
governments pass laws that manipulate the market.<br>
<p>
The Canadian practice of externalizing high cost health care procedures<br>
is very similar to the way in which private companies are encouraged by<br>
tax law and the weak state of civil law (as remedy) to externalize costs<br>
with regard to pollution and education. If businesses actually had to<br>
pay for the costs of education of the workforce and the cost of<br>
pollution (or elimination of same), we would see corporations become<br>
mini-socialist governments in effect, while workers could pick and<br>
choose which corps to trade goods and services with.<br>
<p>
The liberal claims that pollution control is a public good only<br>
government can provide is highly specious, since it was government that<br>
originally ruled that corporations were free to pollute in ways harmful<br>
to the property of others because of the positive economic public good<br>
industrial development provided (i.e. tax dollars in politicians<br>
pockets, politicians who appointed judges). Unrestrained pollution is an<br>
effect of government mercantilism, not the market.<br>
<p>
You'll notice that the largest and most effective penalties against<br>
corporations that pollute are civil actions, not government fines, and<br>
that the most effective environmental regulations passed in the last 30<br>
years were those that aided private citizens in pursuing civil actions<br>
against polluters. You'll also notice that the worst environmental<br>
disasters and general environmental degradation happen under<br>
monopolistic governments, like the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China,<br>
etc. Contrary to popular opinion, the US currently has among the highest<br>
environmental quality of any developed or developing nation.<br>
