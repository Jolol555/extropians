*cough*.  Linux is very public.  The source code is freely available and<br>
modifiable.  People can try to make money by installing it for people<br>
who are ignorant of it, but production is mostly a labor of love.<br>

Personal computers have the advantage is easy setup and use, some<br>

still playing catchup to Unix, which is about a decade older.  But Unix<br>

Backer of Netscape.  I'm not sure why he's a whiner; he may have asked<br>
for an antitrust judgement against Microsoft.<br>
