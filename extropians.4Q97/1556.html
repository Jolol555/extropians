I don't know anything about Oliver, but it is very unlikely a<br>
chimpanzee - human crossbreed would be viable. Just because they are<br>
closely related to us doesn't mean they are compatible. <br>
<p>
Ah, while looking through the net for the correct karyotypes of chimps<br>
and humans I found this:<br>

Genetic testing show he's a chimp, not a human hybrid<br>
<p>
	By JOHN MacCORMACK / San Antonio Express-News <br>
<p>
	SAN ANTONIO - Ending decades of speculation that he represents<br>
	some kind of missing link, genetic testing has shown that<br>
	Oliver the chimp is just that - a chimp.<br>
<p>
	Oliver, now a resident of the Primarily Primates sanctuary in<br>
	Boerne, walks upright like a human.  He was put on display<br>
	throughout the world in the 1970s, touted as a mysterious<br>
	man-ape perhaps the missing link.<br>
<p>
	But it turns out the freak-show attraction is no freak, at<br>
	least genetically.<br>
<p>
	"He's not a human-chimp hybrid. His chromosome number is 48,<br>
	which is a normal chimp karyotype," said Dr. David Ledbetter, a<br>
	geneticist at the University of Chicago who analyzed Oliver's<br>
	chromosomes.<br>
	...<br>
<p>
So much for that interbreeding. <br>
