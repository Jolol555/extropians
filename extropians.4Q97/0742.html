<i>&gt; As I tried to draw, could we make some "flexible" pipes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that have attached  balls with a light gas. This way the</i><br>
<i>&gt; structure rises from earth to space.</i><br>
<p>
Briefly, there are a number of problems.<br>
1) Wind forces would rip it apart.<br>
2) Balloons leak.<br>
3) To float even, say, an empty two-liter bottle requires a <br>
balloon larger than the bottle.  A full one (imagining<br>
something actually trying to climb the pipe) would take a<br>
much larger one, even at ground level.<br>
4) Since the atmosphere thins as you rise in altitude, <br>
balloons don't float as well higher up.<br>
5) Since there's wind, even if it didn't get ripped<br>
apart, it would probably end up at a 45-degree angle,<br>
and subjected to enormous forces (imagine attaching one<br>
end of a soda straw to the ground and the other to a balloon).<br>
6) a 100-km long pipe with the relative dimensions and <br>
structural strength of a soda straw, or even ten end-to-end,<br>
would be about 100 feet in diameter.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, nanotechnology will solve many of these <br>
problems by:<br>
1) making much stronger materials possible, getting rid of the<br>
problems of wind shear and large diameter (which creates<br>
wind resistance)<br>
2) allowing us to make lots (billions) of tiny <br>
(buckyball-sized) balloons instead of clunky big ones --<br>
and buckyballs don't leak<br>
3) allowing the surfaces to react to the wind direction<br>
using AI and tiny actuators<br>
<p>
Sorry not to be more rigorous, but I'm packing for a trip<br>
and it already doesn't look like I'm getting any sleep.<br>
