An update on my little book review project:<br>
<p>
I've skimmed through most of the recent longivity books, and it seems <br>
that the two of most interest to Extropians are the _Brain Longivity_ <br>
book I mentioned, and the updated version of the online Longivity <br>
Manual.  But I don't know if I can make the deadline for this issue, <br>
because I'm running around doing job interviews all this week.  What <br>
is the frequency of the issues?  I could probably do an extended <br>
review for the next one.  Please let me know!<br>
<p>
