Yes, you can't understand the message unless we have a mutually known<br>
key...  But if I'm only sending you one of two messages, 0 or 1, then we<br>
can both "know what the message I want to send you is," having agreed upon<br>
that subluminally, but then use this agreement to send superluminal<br>
communication.<br>
<p>
A very simplistic example of this would be something like "1 if by land, 2<br>
if by sea."  If we were to try something like this using QT, we could agree<br>
that I would either send you a "land" photon with an already agreed upon<br>
polarization or a "sea" photon with a different, previously deterimined,<br>
polarization.  Of course, if relativistic speeds/distances are involved,<br>
that means that I would be able to tell you that the British were going to<br>
attack by land *before they had even chosen to do so* from your<br>
perspective...  The causality problems this could create are enormous.<br>
<p>
To simplify this even further, suppose we have only ONE agreed upon<br>
polarization.  "If I send you a particle with properties X, Y and Z, then<br>
the British have attacked by land; otherwise, they have attacked by sea."<br>
This agreement could have been made subluminally, but the information to be<br>
transferred would be superluminal, and again, I would be able to tell you<br>
how the British would attack long before they had actually done so.<br>
<p>
Similarly, you don't have to know every word in the english language in<br>
order to write words...  You just need to agree on an alphabet.<br>
<p>

     -YEAH BABY I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT YOU'D WANT ME TOO-<br>
