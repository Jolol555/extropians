I have been a member of The Danish national guard for ten years and have<br>
in that time had both M75 NATO 7.62mm Riffle and M62 Machine Gun with<br>
250 live rounds in my house.<br>
<p>
I like shooting. It's fun.<br>
<p>
I have a (Don't know the right word) training in explosives. I like big<br>
explosions too. They too are fun.<br>
<p>
I do understand the fascination of guns and explosives. I just cannot<br>
for the death of me see how it should interrest me, as an extropian,<br>
that somebody has bought a gun. I simply wanted to say that I thought it<br>
was off topic.<br>
<p>
BTW. I don't think you will find many Europeans on the list, who find<br>
private gun ownership in their countries a good idea. I certainly don't.<br>
I know that Gun ownership and libertarianism is a bit provokative to<br>
me.  Stupid european as I am. I think I can handle it though :-) It is<br>
worth considering at least if the extropian list want's to be seen as<br>
international.<br>
