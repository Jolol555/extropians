<p>
I think that is roughly what Gold was suggesting. If this was true,<br>
then oil could be found in completely unsuspected regions if the<br>
conditions were right. Most geologists regard this hypothesis as<br>
wrong, and even Gold has to admit he has so far not found much<br>
evidence to support it.<br>
<p>
Here in Sweden a mining consortium believed his idea enough to start<br>
test drilling for oil and/or gas around lake Siljan, which is an<br>
ancient impact crater and likely to hide oil according to Gold. They<br>
didn't find anything, and I think the consortium has been<br>
disbanded. However, they got some weird gunk during their drillings<br>
which may have been old organics, crust bacteria or just polymerized<br>
lubricants.<br>
