This is possible - but would you want to literally bet your life on it? <br>
<p>
I certainly think that very rational and intelligent beings will be<br>
"good" in some sense, but even that goodness could have unpleasant<br>
consequences for lesser beings ("We are really sorry, but to prevent a<br>
spin-alignment disaster in this part of the galaxy, we need to turn<br>
all mass of the solar system into a ridgeways kamtorus. We will upload<br>
all of you to this emulated earth now"). And evolution has shown us<br>
that in every evolving system parasites and opportunists will appear -<br>
even if the posthumans are benevolent, their web agents or &gt;cockroaches <br>
might cause a lot of grief before their "masters" notice it.<br>
