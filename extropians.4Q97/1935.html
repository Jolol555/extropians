I have to concede that I have been conversing from memory here, and a <br>
quick look on the web verified that my statement that there are good <br>
empirical reasons for believing in a closed universe is not correct. <br>
Here's a good summary of what I found:<br>

I am certain that there are come good arguments for a closed universe <br>
also, as I wrote a paper last year discussing the issue. Unfortunately it <br>
is still located back home with mummy and daddy and demands an excursion. <br>
When I have recovered the paper in a few weeks (if I remember) I will <br>
return to the issue...<br>
