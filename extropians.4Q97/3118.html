   As long as you are willing to submit to the dogma of the Constitution,
politicians need only think of clever ways to make sure that all their forms
of slavery fit under this document. They are doing a fabulous job of making
the average voter feel like he is actually free I might add.
   This is not a judgement of you personally. We all bow down before the whip
of the state and will suffer accordingly.
