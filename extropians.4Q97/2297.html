<i>&gt; vulnerable to bioprocesses and sunlight.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; the stratosphere and simultaneously cross not one, but two, breaks in </i><br>
<i>&gt; atmospheric air current patterns.  (The wind patterns of the earth </i><br>
<i>&gt; are pretty neatly divided into three groups, and adjacent groups </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't interact much.  The groups can be described with a fair degree </i><br>
<i>&gt; of accuracy as: the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and Antarctica.  Almost all human industrial activity has occurred in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the northern hemisphere.)</i><br>

I'm surprised you would post this when I already provided information<br>
which contradicts part of it (the segregation by latitude), along with<br>
a pointer to a FAQ which contradicts the rest of it.<br>

<i>| 4.1) CFC's are 4-8 times heavier than air, so how can they</i><br>
<i>| reach the stratosphere?</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>|  This is answered in Part I of this FAQ, section 1.3. Briefly,</i><br>
<i>|  atmospheric gases do not segragate by weight in the troposphere</i><br>
<i>|  and the stratosphere, because the mixing mechanisms (convection,</i><br>
<i>|  "eddy diffusion") do not distinguish molecular masses. </i><br>
<p>
<i>| 1.3) How does the composition of the atmosphere change</i><br>
<i>| with altitude? (Or, how can CFC's get up to the</i><br>
<i>| stratosphere when they are heavier than air?) </i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| In the earth's troposphere and stratosphere, most _stable_ chemical</i><br>
<i>| species are "well-mixed" - their mixing ratios are independent of</i><br>
<i>| altitude.  If a species' mixing ratio changes with altitude, some</i><br>
<i>| kind of physical or chemical transformation is taking place. That </i><br>
<i>| last statement may seem surprising - one might expect the heavier </i><br>
<i>| molecules to dominate at lower altitudes.  The mixing ratio of </i><br>
<i>| Krypton (mass 84), then, would decrease with altitude, while that </i><br>
<i>| of Helium (mass 4) would increase.  In reality, however, molecules </i><br>
<i>| do not segregate by weight in the troposphere or stratosphere.  </i><br>
<i>| The relative proportions of Helium, Nitrogen, and Krypton are </i><br>
<i>| unchanged up to about 100 km.  </i><br>
<p>
To repeat what I posted yesterday about latitude differences:<br>
<p>
<i>| 4.2) CFCs are produced in the Northern Hemisphere, so how do they get down to</i><br>
<i>| the Antarctic?</i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>| Vertical transport into and within the stratosphere is slow.  It</i><br>
<i>| takes more than 5 years for a CFC molecule released at sea level to</i><br>
<i>| rise high enough in the stratosphere to be photolyzed.  North-South</i><br>
<i>| transport, in both troposphere and stratosphere, is faster - there is </i><br>
<i>| a bottleneck in the tropics (it can take a year or two to get across</i><br>
<i>| the equator) but there is still plenty of time.  CFC's are distributed </i><br>
<i>| almost uniformly as a function of latitude, with a gradient of ~10%</i><br>
<i>| from Northern to Southern Hemispheres.</i><br>
<i>| [Singh et al. 1979] [Elkins et al. 1993]</i><br>
<p>
I'm curious.  Do you really believe this stuff, or are you intentionally<br>
posting falsehoods and misleading information for some reason?<br>
