<i>&gt; So I've heard.:) Anyway, from what I've read/seen, their brains are</i><br>
<i>&gt; divided up a bit.  Prima facie, it would seem there are multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; lobes which are somewhat independent -- which is akin to neural</i><br>
<i>&gt; ganglia in insects.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I have a picture here before me of an octopus brain. The general<br>
layout looks a bit like two kidneys linked with a long and not very<br>
thick cord, with a tangle of ganglia in the middle. Very different<br>
from our brain, yet still with some similarities. According to the<br>
book (Introduction to Neurobiology by Heinrich Reichert) they have<br>
10^8 neurons (this is likely the genus octopus). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, in this case, the thing to do might be to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; connections between lobes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course,  I am assuming here that more connections = smarts.</i><br>
<p>
Not certain, but it might be useful to try. I would also add some<br>
extra lobes for high level integration, maybe even a computer-brain<br>
interface (why not start by giving them net access? talk.soc.octopi,<br>
anyone?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would also be exciting to uplift them since</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are so different from us.  I imagine the ideas/experiences they/we could</i><br>
<i>&gt; share would be fantastic/near-mind-shattering to us/them.</i><br>
<p>
They have an excellent visual system and a beautiful texture-shifting<br>
capability. I think they would develop some very interesting art.<br>
