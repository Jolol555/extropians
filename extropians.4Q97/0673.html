<p>
Does angular velocity produce relativistic time dilation effects?  Would it be<br>
possible to get your head and/or body to spin/orbit fast enough to time warp<br>
into the future without the centrifugal force turning it to pulp?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your neurons might die because of the death</i><br>

<i>&gt; transplant these cells, you would still die.</i><br>
<p>
Would continually supplanting a brain with, say fetus neurons, permit some sort<br>
of biological uploading/augmentation, where the fresh neurons make up for/mimic<br>
the ones that are dying off in the adult brain?  The brain does appear to have<br>
a fair bit of redundancy worked into its structure, so given some time to<br>
integrate themselves with the old neurons, the new ones may be enough for a<br>
transparent transition from one generation of neurons to the next.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even that we do find a way to correct</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the errors in the genome that cause aging, it will be very difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; to save us (I'm writing an article about that, BTW). There are a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; theories but none is currently technically possible, which means that if</i><br>
<i>&gt; we did find the genetic causes for aging (by far our best hope to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control aging) we would still age and die. What do you think about it?</i><br>
<p>
Assuming we can engineer designer restriction enzymes/ligases with the ability<br>
to cut and paste DNA segments with high specificity, and that a<br>
distribution/communication system can be set up to apply these operations to<br>
all of the cells in a body, implementing the newly found bug-fix/patch to some<br>
disease should be straightforward.  Eventually, this should lead to an<br>
optimized and perhaps minimal genome which will allow standarized (platform<br>
independent?) disease patches and/or body subsystem upgrades.  This technology<br>
should arrive much before nanotech, as much of the enzyme machinery is already<br>
in place.  Designing the genetic patches and predicting their side effects is,<br>
of course, the hard part, but nanotech faces the same hurdle.  Are<br>
object-oriented protein languages &amp; compilers far off?<br>
