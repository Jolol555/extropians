Thanks for the cite and interesting excerpts.<br>
<p>
I would not dispute that Grinder &amp; Bandler were doing work that was not<br>
closely controlled when compared to, say, the RPK work currently being<br>
facilitated via John Walker's "Hotbits" site at www.fourmilab.ch.<br>
<p>
I am unaware of any research of that rigor into Ericksonian hypnosis or<br>
Satir's family therapy, for that matter; yet both fields are respected in<br>
some reputable quarters, and both informed some of Grinder &amp; Bandler's<br>
pursuits of "modelling excellence". I don't think all their work is<br>
prudently rejected out-of-hand; nor should every claim made by every person<br>
claiming to be doing NLP be swallowed whole.<br>
<p>
Two things: you wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;NeuroLinguistic Programming is perhaps the best known, a kind of New Age</i><br>
<i>&gt;hot-tub behaviourism </i><br>
<p>
1) I've heard things that could be interpreted as such, but I wonder what<br>
you drew that capsule summary from? Could it have been a narrow<br>
interpretation of such heuristics as "The meaning of a communication is the<br>
response you get"? Or just the technique-y style of certain<br>
practitioners/promoters? Please tell me more, if you can. :)<br>
<p>
&lt;...&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Still, the Committee did recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt;follow-ups on several lines: accelerated learning, biofeedback, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;NeuroLinguistic Programming - even though it found `no scientific evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;that neurolinguistic programming is an effective strategy for exerting</i><br>
<i>&gt;influence.'</i><br>
<p>
2) This phrasing makes me think of adversary-manipulation psyops, rather<br>
than general officer training. <br>
<p>
<p>
Re: NLP *and* psi: If it depends on the skill of the operator, it's not<br>
engineering, at best it's art. And one of the signs of pathological science<br>
is appeals to things like the skill of the operator,<br>
just-noticeable-differences, etc. So it's a slippery slope with interesting<br>
terrain, not a simple thing like a magic (MKULTRA?) bullet to the brain. <br>
