&lt; Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer<br>
technology in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon<br>
features smaller indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over<br>
distance, and voltage can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is<br>
an inherent aspect of the chemistry) if nothing else will cause<br>
problems.  Other technologies will have to be developed to replace<br>
silicon.  It may happen, but there is nothing which looks very<br>
practical as a replacement right now. &gt;<br>
<p>
And I recall CarlF’s fairly recent comments about problems with the<br>
spiraling costs of silicon circuitry fabrication facilities.  However,<br>
the cover of the current issue (971006) of Forbes magazine roars about<br>
"Life at 100,000,000,000 Bits Per Second" and "Photonics is the next<br>
stage of the digital revolution."<br>
<p>
Now, I don’t find the concept of technological Singularities very<br>
useful (except in the sense that Anders Sandberg recently defined<br>
them); but, Howard Banks’ Forbes article, "The Law of the Photon"<br>
starts off as follows: "Moore’s Law said that chip power would double<br>
every 18 months. That’s plodding. The new law of the photon says that<br>
bandwidth triples every year" and continues: "Making all this possible<br>
is photonics . . . There is no official name for the law that says how<br>
fast this science will carry us into the next century. We could,<br>
however, call it Payne’s Law, in honor of David Payne, a 53-year-old<br>
physicist at Britain’s University of Southampton. Payne is perhaps the<br>
leading scientist behind two key inventions in photonics over the past<br>
decade and a half."  These are listed as the optical fiber amplifier<br>
and wave-division multiplexing.<br>
<p>
Hal concluded:<br>
&lt; But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We<br>
can guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but<br>
beyond 20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are<br>
inclined to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In<br>
practice though things often take much longer than we expect. &gt;<br>
<p>
And Brian Atkins replied:<br>
&lt; For anything related to software engineering (AI), I agree with you.<br>
Unless we can come up with ways to reduce the complexity of software<br>
development, things there will get slower and slower. Hardware on the<br>
other hand should continue to grow for at least another 20 years even<br>
with the technologies we have today. The question is: does<br>
super-hardware without AI software bring about a singularity? Or will<br>
the super-hardware make the effort of programming an AI possible? &gt;<br>
<p>
I have long felt that communication is just as important as<br>
computation to the development of AI / SI / Uploads / Nanotech.  I<br>
don’t expect a capital-S Singularity, but I do expect things to get<br>
VERY interesting at an increasing rate of change.. While our<br>
computational capabilities have been expanding according to Moore’s<br>
Law, bandwidth, and the human ability to utilize it, have not been<br>
keeping pace.  The Web, after all, is only a few years old.  One<br>
promising approach to finally achieving ‘real’ AI is the recent<br>
emphasis on agent-based computing along with even more recent attempts<br>
to create software for the emerging Global Brain (c.f.,<br>
