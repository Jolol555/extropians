Huh? If the aggregate external costs are greater than the aggregate<br>
external benefits, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is<br>
telling us because those costs are not included in the cost of<br>
production. If guns aren't as inexpensive as the market is telling us,<br>
then before we decide if they are practical we best figure out how much<br>
they *do* cost us. I'm using "practical" in one of its common sense<br>
meanings: "efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose."<br>
<p>
This stated purpose is securing power and rights (personal autonomy and<br>
freedom) according to the doctrine of force presented in M. Lorry's<br>
post. I don't dispute that they can help, I merely suggest that if you<br>
care about doing this with minimum cost, then you have to also take into<br>
account the externalities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I could argue that there is no method available that "-ensures- {emph.</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine] [one's] own personal autonomy and freedom", but I know of an approach</i><br>
<i>&gt; that seems to be recurrently popular the world over and has some success</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate: monopolize power and subjugate everyone else. It worked for Bokassa,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amin, Dzugashvili, Emperor Ch'an... And _it's_ not a sure thing, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to be a certain type of person.</i><br>
<p>
My initial post flowed out of the assertion that firearms aid in the<br>
exercise of force. Again, I don't dispute this at all. Nor do I dispute<br>
the fact that the exercise of force *enables* one to secure personal<br>
autonomy and freedom. I may have mischaracterized Mike's argument by<br>
using the word "ensures," if so, apologies. My only issue with all of<br>
this is that firearms may not be the most practical means to this end.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't want this to devolve into a kneejerking match, but let me pose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same question I asked earlier in a slightly different form: what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; external cost of that left-for-dead fifteen year old girl?</i><br>
<p>
It is beyond my ability to assign a monetary value to a human life. <br>
