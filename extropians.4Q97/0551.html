<i>&gt;&gt; What companies would you recommend?  It seems that everyone agrees</i><br>
<i>&gt;this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; good idea, but I haven't seen a lot of specifics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since I work in infotech, my investments are currently concentrated</i><br>
<i>&gt;there.  Following the general strategy of picking market leaders in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fast-growing market, I would recommend a distribution of investment</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital among the following companies:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Microsoft</i><br>
<p>
Although the P/E is a bit high, Microsoft will almost certainly make it a<br>
reality, so this would be a decent investment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Intel</i><br>
<p>
Intel has a high P/E for a chip vendor, but since many of Intel's<br>
competitors are essentially folding to Intel (e.g. DEC, HP ), this company<br>
should continue to exhibit strong growth.  This would be a reasonable<br>
investment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Compaq</i><br>
<p>
*Hell no*.  A P/E of 37.8 is absolutely absurd for a hardware vendor.  The<br>
only reason the price has risen to such an absurd level is the glut of<br>
money in the market driving up the prices for blue chips.  This would be a<br>
poor investment IMO.  Not to mention that Compaq is facing dangerously<br>
strong competition from Dell and HP.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Dell</i><br>
<p>
Another hardware vendor with an astronomical P/E ( 49.6 ).  The problem<br>
with investing in corporate PC vendors is that the market is relatively<br>
fixed.  Companies grow by stealing market share from someone else, such as<br>
the case is with Dell.  The market share of PC vendors is quite unstable<br>
and can shift suddenly and unpredictably on a very short timeframe.  This<br>
P/E would suggest that Dell will remain *the* market leader for at least a<br>
decade.  I wouldn't bet on it...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;IBM</i><br>
<p>
At a P/E of 18.1 and a healthy EPS, this is would be a good "value" based<br>
investment.  IBM will most likely continue to grow at steady and<br>
respectable rate for the foreseeable future.  They are worth this much<br>
based on their intellectual capital alone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sun</i><br>
<p>
Sun will be reasonable investment for a couple years, but its long-term<br>
prospects are fuzzy.  It's growth has been at the expense of other RISC<br>
vendors, but that won't last forever, and their hardware isn't that great<br>
relative to their competitors.  If they focus a lot more on software, they<br>
may have a chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Netscape</i><br>
<p>
I don't have much of an opinion on Netscape.  Unless they decide on a<br>
specific direction and execute it with some force of will, Netscape will<br>
dwindle IMO.  They can't make a profit now and I don't see why they will in<br>
the immediate future.  It wouldn't surprise me if they get bought out or<br>
merge in a couple of years from now, probably with one of the big database<br>
vendors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oracle</i><br>
<p>
At a P/E of 51, I would neither buy nor sell Oracle, because strong future<br>
growth is uncertain beyond a couple years.  It's got some growing space,<br>
but if Informix gets its act together, they could seriously impede the<br>
expansion of Oracle.  Many parts of the developing world, such as Asia, are<br>
primarily Informix territory.  And Sybase is once again competing, from<br>
behind, but somewhat effectively against Oracle for NT servers.  Another<br>
surprise: IBM'S DB/2 is making strong inroads into Oracle territory<br>
according to recent reports (!?).<br>
<p>
Oracle won't weaken, but there is no guarantee you'll show strong growth<br>
for any period of time either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of these, performance over the past 5 years ranges from the moderate</i><br>
<i>&gt;(50% in two years for Netscape) to the truly astounding (2200% in 5</i><br>
<i>&gt;years for Dell).  Compaq, Intel, and Oracle all come in between 1000 and</i><br>
<i>&gt;1300% over the last 5 years.  Microsoft is a comparatively measly 500%. </i><br>
<i>&gt;IBM an anemic 200%.</i><br>
<p>
These statistics are largely irrelevant based on market conditions at the<br>
time these values occurred, and in the markets that some of these companies<br>
are in.  I can guarantee that Dell will *not* show a repeat performance in<br>
the next 5 years, despite their strong growth in the past 5.  Compaq will<br>
choke.  IBM, although anemic, is a steady reliable earner.  Additionally,<br>
companies like IBM are not traditional "growth" stocks, and shouldn't be<br>
expected to behave as such.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;A couple caveats:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) This performance reflects a very strong bull market in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;period.  A bull market especially favors growth stocks.</i><br>
<p>
Yep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) This investment strategy is quite likely to produce years of negative</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth.  Use it only if you are willing to accept some risk, and willing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to hang on tight to your investments for a period of several years.</i><br>
<p>
Blue chips tech stocks will be a *bad* place to be for many years.  The<br>
mutual fund money glut has driven up blue chip prices to an unsupportable<br>
level.  It will take a long time to recover something resembling value from<br>
many of these stocks due to the currently lofty valuations.  Invest in<br>
these at your own risk.<br>
