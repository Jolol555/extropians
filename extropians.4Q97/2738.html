<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How many times have you had these feelings and they've been wrong? I</i><br>
know<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in my case the answer is 'lots'. And how do you know that you ever had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those feelings and they aren't just false memories created after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fact? Did you write anything down at the time?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Personally I think our brains go wrong far, far more often than most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; us realise, and that explains an awful lot of 'psychic' experiences...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and why they can't be reproduced in a laboratory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Obviously it's natural to have those types of feelings and be wrong. </i><br>
Of<br>
<i>&gt; course it happens more than not.  But when instance after instance occur,</i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt; tend to wonder.  And of course I can't prove to you they are false</i><br>
memories<br>
<i>&gt; that happened after fact, I can only tell you honestly, that was my</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience; that's what happened.  I'm not going to forget the events</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; happened in an instance like that.  On the contrary I remember them quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; clearly.  No I didn't right anything down at the time, but when I first</i><br>
had<br>
<i>&gt; that "vision" of the yellow rider truck, I did mention it to my mother,</i><br>
but<br>
<i>&gt; at the time I didn't think it was overly significant, but she still can</i><br>
<i>&gt; recall me mentioning it.  And also right after I put down the phone with</i><br>
my<br>
<i>&gt; friend, and then came back, I told him what had happen.  I told several</i><br>
<i>&gt; people directly after the incedent.  And they all can recall what I said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And as far as brains "going wrong" (whatever you exactly mean by that),</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps that will explain some failures in attempt to reproduce in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; laboratory, but what about those psychic experiences in which someone</i><br>
makes<br>
<i>&gt; mention of something ahead of time and it happens to come true.  Are all</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; our brains "going wrong" coneviently at the same time?</i><br>
