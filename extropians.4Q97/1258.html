<i>&gt; Hi, Ive read it somewhere too but cant recall why they think its a crystal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  A majority of their knowledge comes from earthquakes and hydrogen/nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; explosions, and I've read a different article (discover(y?) magazine) on how</i><br>
<i>&gt; they now know from waves from things like that, that the surface of the outer</i><br>
<i>&gt; core is very jagged, definately not smooth, but they didnt say anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt; a crystal, so puting the two together I've always thought of the outer core</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a crystal and the inner core being a much denser crystal, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mantle being an ocean with currents and such playing off the energies of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; core.  The dynamic relationship between the two crystals and the mantle must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
TO put this all to rest, I spoke with my cousin, Andrew Lorrey, who is a<br>
graduate Geology student at U Maine, Orino. He said that the outer core<br>
is molten, but the inner core is solid iron/nickel with a smidgen of<br>
heavy elements. The inner core is NOT a single crystal, but as a solid<br>
does have a crystalline structure, which is decidedly different than a<br>
single crystal.<br>
