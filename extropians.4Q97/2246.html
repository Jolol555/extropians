There are two ways to measure the Earth's temperature; you can either <br>
take a lot of surface measurements, try to correct for errors, then feed <br>
them into a computer model which may or may not reflect reality, or you <br>
can just launch satellites and measure it. The CAG (Computer Aided Guess)<br>
systems do, indeed, say that the temperature has increased and is <br>
increasing.<br>
<p>
But what happens when you stop guessing and actually measure it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From <a href="http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd12mar97_1.htm:">http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd12mar97_1.htm:</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;Dr. Roy W. Spencer (NASA Marshall Space Flight Center) and Dr. John </i><br>
<i>&gt;Christy (The University of Alabama in Huntsville) have used the Microwave &gt;Sounding Units (MSUs) flying aboard NOAA's TIROS-N weather satellites to</i><br>
<i>&gt;construct a continuous record of lower tropospheric (from the surface to </i><br>
<i>&gt;about 4 miles) temperatures since the first MSU was launched in late 1978. </i><br>

<i>&gt;degrees C/decade.</i><br>
<p>
So there you have it; the temperature of the atmosphere is decreasing by<br>
0.04 degrees per decade. This isn't a guess, it's an actual measurement,<br>
and matches measurements taken in situ by balloon. As a programmer and<br>
physicist measurements give me a warm fuzzy feeling that computer-aided<br>
guesses just can't match.<br>
<p>
Now this is not to say that there aren't other effects (e.g. oceans,<br>
high-level atmosphere) which the atmosphere measurements are missing, <br>
or that the temperature hasn't risen in the past (though it's odd that <br>
most of the supposed greenhouse-gas increase occured before most of <br>
the greenhouse gases were released). But it seems like good evidence <br>
that we are heading for an ice age, not greenhouse warming.<br>
