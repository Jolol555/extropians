<i>&gt; we've lectured and nitpicked.  </i><br>
<p>
(ROFL)<br>
<p>
That appears to sum it up. I am of late, thankfully, rarely at such<br>
loggerheads regarding what I think of as simple communication, and I didn't<br>
mean to nitpick or lecture. Perhaps I did anyway. Regarding our present<br>
contretemps: I thought it was worth noting that you seemed to be carrying<br>
some Platonic ideal around and doing a little jackdaw epistemology. I am<br>
not completely without sin on that score myself.<br>
<p>
Judging from your reactions, you got your buttons pushed. Sorry, honest.<br>
Humor me, grab a beer and look at this pair of exchanges as if someone else<br>
had engaged in them:<br>
<p>
###<br>
<p>
(1)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm left with only one possible explanation for this misunderstanding:</i><br>
<p>
&lt;Apologies here, any time I only have one explanation it's a clue I haven't<br>
thought about something enough.&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it your impression that one side of (or even _any_ of) the participants in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; this specific discussion think that "orange juice is the perfect food" (to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; use my analogy)? Did they SAY that anywhere, or is someone doing a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; amateur mindreading here?</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;So now I am not only illogical, I am irrelevant? </i><br>
<p>
&lt;Not at all. I didn't call it irrelevant, I said you were mindreading.<br>
Facts not in evidence, and all that. If a bunch of people had been saying,<br>
in unison, "guns are the best way to settle an argument over a parking<br>
spot", you might have more of a case. The implication in your writing, it<br>
seemed to me, is that there is or ought to be a single best way, and that<br>
participants in this discussion agree with that notion; I don't see that in<br>
evidence.&gt;<br>
<p>
(2)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; _I_ certainly never said that. Who did? Raise your hands, please...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't have the time to pull out examples of statements you have made</i><br>
<i>&gt;that implicate practicality.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;That wasn't my point: my point was that you were talking as if an absolute<br>
best under all circumstances could be determined. As mentioned in excerpt 1.&gt;<br>
<p>
###<br>
<p>
*sigh*<br>
<p>
Keith, the level of discussion we have achieved here is far below what I'd<br>
hoped.<br>
<p>
Perhaps I am hallucinating. Somebody around here is conflating economics<br>
with externalities, and ethical-social-esthetic costs with dollars and<br>
cents, and pragmatic circumstantial maxima with ideal abstraction "ceteris<br>
paribus" maxima; and I don't think it's me.<br>
<p>
"Dear sir: You may be right. Sincerely, Mark Twain"<br>
<p>
Peace.<br>
