      Hello!<br>
<p>
<p>
      From time to time, people over here in England ask me -- with an <br>
      occasional nuanced edge of annoyance: "If you think Americans are so <br>
      &lt;expletive deleted&gt; great, why don't you go and live in America?"<br>
<p>
<p>
      There are several reasons why I don't live in America, in addition <br>
      to the peculiarly difficult immigration procedures for us Brits;<br>
<p>
<p>
      America has lost so much that is _irreplaceably_ precious.<br>
<p>
      Having to live right alongside this dissonance might prove to be <br>
      intolerably painful for me.  Having to live with:<br>
      <br>
      [1] The nightmarish and oppressively unjust 'legal' system;<br>
      <br>
      [2] The systemic political corruption -- Democrat and Republican -- <br>
      with its attendant numbskull politicians subservient to the monied <br>
      oligarchies and special interests.<br>
<p>
      [3] The random and remorselessly escalating official and unofficial <br>
      violence in society.<br>
      <br>
      [4]  The massive concealed violence against children; look at the <br>
      'superpredators' and ask: How would you bring a kid up, for him (or <br>
      her) to behave like this as an adult?"<br>
<p>
      [5] The horrifying social insecurity -- most people are one paycheck <br>
      away from ruin, and there's no 'safety net' either.  The medical <br>
      system sucks.  This gives far too much bargaining-power into the <br>
      hands of employers etc.  This may be OK if you're young and fit and <br>
      into adrenalin highs, but to those of us with a more reflective <br>
      temperament...<br>
<p>
      [6]  The yawning gap between the constant 'official rap' about what <br>
      the country's supposed to stand for, and the unbearably harsh social <br>
      reality itself, is a widening chasm, which causes unbearable social <br>
      dissonances.  Incomes falling every year since 1973, while taxes <br>
      rise and weekly hours worked rise by 33%.<br>
<p>
      That is: America is being steadily remade from 'America the Free' <br>
      into a Continental-Scale Slave-Labour Maximum Security Prison, with <br>
      all the mores and practices of a Maximum Security Prison reproduced <br>
      into the wider society.  <br>
<p>
      Claire Wolfe is -- in all the essentials -- right.<br>
       <br>
      As Chris Rea sings:<br>
<p>
      "This ain't no Technological Breakdown;<br>
<p>
       This is the Road to Hell."<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
     The future of America matters _intensely_ to me.  I have two <br>
     relatives buried at Arlington -- Dene Smith, who worked with Oliver <br>
     Franks (later 'Sir Oliver', and 'C' -- Director of MI6) at the <br>
     American Interests Section of the Foreign Office; and her husband <br>
     Hawley Armistead Smith, a senior US Army officer and US Consul in <br>
     Canada and Italy.<br>
<p>
     If a quiet patriotism is the love of the _idea_ of a country, I'm a <br>
     North American by choice, rather than by accident of birth.<br>
<p>
     Here's why:  'Policy Review' republished this next piece in Fall '83. <br>
     I and my friends are among the all-too-few people around who are <br>
     crazy enough actually to subscribe to these principles...<br>

[TRACK TEN]  "The Role Of History".<br>
<p>
   TEXT: In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine<br>
   advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve <br>
   o'clock, imagining this staccato message to his partner:-<br>
<p>
      "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for..  It's you and our little <br>
   house and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the fighting <br>
   chance, to go ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want out here... <br>
   to win this war... to get home... To go back to living our lives in a <br>
   land -- and a world -- where *every* man is free to grow as great as <br>
   he's a mind to be...  where *every* man has an *unlimited* opportunity <br>
   to be useful to himself and his fellow men ...<br>
<p>
     "Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no <br>
   matter what they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to <br>
   keep America a land of *individual freedom*!<br>
<p>
<p>
      _That's_ what we're fighting for... <br>
<p>
      _That's_ what we're willing to die for... <br>
<p>
      _That's_ the America we want when we come home."<br>
<p>
<p>
      So say Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and I.  Amen.<br>
<p>
<p>
      We're the sort of people who smash the Bridges at Toko-Ri...<br>
<p>
      See the video of James Michener's inspiring story, with William <br>
      Holden, Mickey Rooney, and Grace Kelly.<br>
<p>
      Michael Levin closed off his article on the draft (which quoted the <br>
      above passage) with these words:<br>
<p>
      "We had better figure out what happened if we expect _any_ army,  <br>
      conscript or volunteer,  even to _remember_ what it's fighting for." <br>
<p>
<p>
      Too bloody right.  Here's what happened.  All the bloody conformists <br>
      and 'obedience trainers' and 'discipline' freaks crushed the spirit <br>
      out of most Americans, didn't they?  So you have a mostly <br>
      broken-willed conformist population where those who 'fitted in' and <br>
      did what they were told ended up with the career 'credentials' <br>
      (paperwork) for positions of social control, and will now put up <br>
      with damn nearly anything, and will fight for _nothing_ worthwhile.<br>
<p>
     As things are in present-day America, a wealthy corporate oligarchy <br>
     with state surrogates owns and controls _both sides_ of the political <br>
     process, and the legal system is in the grip of authoritarians and <br>
     lawyers (often the same people) who are hideously destroying <br>
     everything the American Dream actually stands for.<br>
<p>
     The administration of 'justice' is so oppressive, tyrannical and <br>
     unsafe that no free person would possibly consent to live within its <br>
     jurisdiction if they truly understood the risks to their lives, their <br>
     liberties and their property.  The entire country is being turned <br>
     into a maximum-security prison; this steadily reproduces the mores <br>
     and practices of a maximum-security prison in the wider society.<br>
<p>
<p>
     1.3 million citizens are presently 'internally' imprisoned (and often <br>
     tortured as well), most for victimless 'crimes.'  Viz:<br>

<i>&gt;      SAN FRANCISCO -- Some 3-5,000 demonstrators marched and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rallied in San Francisco on Saturday to demand freedom for former</i><br>
<i>&gt; Black Panther, award winning journalist and death row political</i><br>
<i>&gt; prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Framed-up by Pennsylvania's racist "justice" system in 1981</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a crime he did not commit, Abu-Jamal continues to sit on</i><br>
<i>&gt; death row. A target of the FBI's infamous COINTELPRO program and</i><br>
<i>&gt; a decades-long vendetta by Philadelphia cops, Abu-Jamal is housed</i><br>
<i>&gt; in SCI-Greene, a notorious "Super-Max" high-tech hell-hole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; According to Amnesty International's Secretary General, who heard</i><br>
<i>&gt; testimony from Mumia on prison conditions in November:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      "Death row in Pennsylvania looks and feels like a morgue."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everything is high-tech, and there is no human being in sight.</i><br>
<i>&gt; From the moment that condemned prisoners arrive, the state tries</i><br>
<i>&gt; to kill them slowly, mechanically and deliberately -- first</i><br>
<i>&gt; spiritually, and then physically."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
    Barry Goldwater's chief speechwriter Karl Hess, and murdered actress <br>
    Jean Seberg ('Lilith', 'St. Joan') -- one of many activists murdered <br>
    by FBI serial-killer J. Edgar Hoover -- also supported the Black <br>
    Panthers, by the way.<br>
<p>
<p>
    So I -- and many North Americans also -- live in a state of _exile_ <br>
    from a Free North America that does not yet exist.  As Cookie Rankin <br>
    of the glorious Scottish-Canadian 'Rankin Family' (go get their CD <br>
    'North Country') said here in Bristol when asked for a song for 'we <br>
    exiles':<br>
<p>
<p>
    "We are _all_ exiles.'<br>
<p>
<p>
    In present-day North America -- again, at this time -- 250 000 <br>
    military veterans are homeless, this bitter winter of '97.  Give them <br>
    all high-powered firearms, and just watch the political 'priorities' <br>
    suddenly shift.  There are Fire Control Officers who are _really <br>
    pkssed off_ about the fate of their comrades -- and their country -- <br>
    and who are quietly programming in the the GPS coordinates of the <br>
    authoritarian "Right"'s -- illegal -- propaganda mills and <br>
    antiConstitutional 'law' factories _right now_.<br>
<p>
    I advise every libertarian in North America to get a rifle (semiauto); <br>
    a shotgun (12ga. pump with 00 buck and rifled slugs) and a handgun <br>
    (9mm. or up -- Walthers and Browning Hi-Powers are good, compact and <br>
    reliable). Right now. Take competent range instruction.  Practice <br>
    regularly. Sharpen up!  Watch the legislators suddenly address your <br>
    concerns most assiduously!<br>
<p>
    &lt;sigh&gt;  OK: Maybe we have to go; but we can take out _all_ the goddamn <br>
    authoritarians right along with us...  And their fell mouthpieces. <br>
    There's an exact correlation between intelligence and accuracy with <br>
    firearms.  And we're _smarter_ than they are.<br>
<p>
<p>
    In the UK under Thatcher and the Tories, homelessness multiplied <br>
    ten-fold, while the average age of the homeless at death dropped from <br>
    47 to 42.  Average life expectancy is 74.  Same thing happened under <br>
    Reagan.  50% of American small farmers went out of business.  A few <br>
    thousand Crony-Capitalists who wanted nothing except all the wealth, <br>
    all the land and all the power got even richer than they were already.<br>
<p>
    The Politics of -- murderous -- Cruelty.<br>
<p>
    Which we ruthlessly smashed at the last election here.  The tory Party <br>
    implodes and re-implodes by the day.<br>
<p>
    As Eithne Ni Bhraonian - 'enya' - sings -- beautifully, brilliantly, <br>
    bitterly -- on her magnificent album 'Watermark' (a copy of which I <br>
    sent to President Bush as a gift at the conclusion of the Gulf War):<br>

    of the Rings' on the same day, 28 February).<br>

TITLE: "SUPERCARRIER"<br>
<p>
TEXT: The cover article in March's issue of "Popular Mechanics", an <br>
excellent American magazine, is titled "War Machine!" and subtitled <br>
"America's Newest Supercarriers Pack More Firepower than all of World War <br>
II"  There is an interesting and well-written article, and a colour wall <br>
poster.<br>
<p>
The inset text for the colour poster reads:<br>

                            &lt;&lt; SUPERCARRIER &gt;&gt;<br>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
'First commissioned in 1975, the USS Nimitz (CVAN 68) launched a new class <br>
of carriers that now numbers five.  The other members of this supercarrier <br>
family include the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVAN 69), the USS Carl Vinson <br>
(CVAN 70) the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVAN 71) and the newest member, the <br>
USS Abraham Lincoln (CVAN 72), commisioned in December, 1989.<br>
<p>
Nimitz-class carriers are enormous nuclear-powered self-contained floating <br>
cities. Supported by a Carrier Battle Group, they can stay at sea <br>
indefinitely.  And with a full complement of 9 to 10 air squadrons, two <br>
Sea Sparrow missile launchers, four close-in weapons systems and 5400 men <br>
and women, they can be deployed tactically and strategically.  Each <br>
Nimitz-class carrier costs approximately $3 billion, and they'll be our <br>
number one instrument of Naval striking power well into the next <br>
century.'<br>
<p>
(The averaged age of the crew of a Nimitz-class carrier is 19 yrs, 2 mo.)<br>
