Regarding theories of human migration into the Americas <br>
Kristen Brennan said : <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Can you suggest a URL/book/whatever where I can learn more about this?</i><br>
<p>
I do not have a academic journal reference to the theory of multiple<br>
migrations. But the following newspaper article from August 21, 1997 <br>
is relevant:<br>
<a href="http://detnews.com/1997/nation/9708/21/08210077.htm">http://detnews.com/1997/nation/9708/21/08210077.htm</a><br>
<p>
The article discusses a skull which was recently found in the Columbia<br>
river which radio carbon dating suggests is 8,400 years old.  The analysis<br>
of the skull and its disposition have caused controversy:<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
The remains, uncovered last summer, provide strong evidence that the New<br>
World's earliest arrivals may not have been direct ancestors of modern-day<br>
American Indians.<br>
<p>
Instead, many of the latest studies suggest, America's earliest<br>
inhabitants may have arrived in migrations thousands of years earlier from<br>
places much farther away, most probably southern Asia, but perhaps even<br>
northern Europe.<br>
<p>
Kennewick was the latest in a series of finds and re-examinations<br>
beginning in 1992 that have shared a startling common denominator: the<br>
oldest of the skeletons appear to have Eurasian features, as opposed to<br>
the northern Asian features, common to modern American Indians, that are<br>
characteristic of later-date remains.<br>
<p>
The issue raises questions about the prehistoric foundation of American<br>
Indians in their ancestral lands. More immediately, it lays open the<br>
question of who wins possession of the oldest remains. <br>
<p>
In Kennewick Man's case, a group of tribes in the area have demanded a<br>
halt to all studies and immediate reburial -- a move that some<br>
anthropologists claim would be an affront to historical inquiry. "Some<br>
scientists say that if this individual is not studied further, we, as<br>
Indians, will be destroying evidence of our own history," says Armand<br>
Minthorn, a member of the board of trustees with the Confederated Tribes<br>
of the Umatilla. "We already know our history."<br>
