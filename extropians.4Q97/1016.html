I have read Prometheus rising several times as well as many of RAW's other<br>
tomes. In my experience, perceptual re-training is, indeed, possible as<br>
well as incredibly fun. To paraphrase RAW there is nothing wrong with the<br>
Universe, humans merely misuse their brain..instead of using your brain for<br>
failure and misery, use it for fun and profit. My re-programming began with<br>
a right temporal lobectomy. In the two months after surgery I was concerned<br>
only with the basics of survival (Circuit One for those familiar with the<br>
Leary-Wilson 8 Circuit model) during which I found it possible to<br>
re-imprint fundamental programs about how I perceive the world, myself and<br>
how to move from one perceptual framwork to another - that the current<br>
framework I am using is but one of billions and if I find it not to my<br>
pleasure, it is possible to change to a perspective that is more to my<br>
liking.  As I gained more functions I found myself blissfully hanging out<br>
in the 5th circuit. From the Hedonic Engineering capability of the 5th<br>
circuit I discovered it easy to jump to the 6th and 7th so as to literally<br>
change my world. In other words, as many before me have doneI used somatic<br>
bliss as a conduit to expanded consciousness. The benefits are many. For me<br>
I find joy and expansiveness comes from the ability to program the<br>
programmer.<br>
<p>
The experience seems akin to that described by those who sought to expand<br>
their consciousness through the use of psychedelics.<br>
