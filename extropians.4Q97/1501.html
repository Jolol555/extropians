<i>&gt;&gt; There also are many examples of Microsoft products opening back</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; doors on machines to allow their servers to gain access, or for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; their anti-piracy software to check for stolen products...</i><br>
<p>
It never ceases to amaze me how many seemingly intelligent<br>
people can fall for such an obviously absurd urban legend<br>
like this.  (1) Microsoft gets investigated by the FTC for<br>
doing such terrible things as freely negotiating a contract<br>
with Compaq for its use of Windows, or for the audacity to<br>
give away their browser.  They get castigated in the press<br>
for making a Java that's a little bit different from Sun's.<br>
If they were caught doing something as truly underhanded as<br>
this, it would be front page headline news, and people would<br>
be screaming for jail terms (I mean people one would normally<br>
take seriously, not the kind of people already screaming for<br>
Bill's head).  (2) If they did have code that did this, all<br>
that would be necessary to prove it is a filename and byte<br>
offset, and anyone could go disassemble the code and see for<br>
themselves.  This is such a trivial thing to prove, the <br>
complete lack of such proof in any of these stories makes it<br>
obvious that they are just fabrication.<br>
<p>
No doubt we'll see stories next week that Bill is running<br>
a black-market stolen kidney syndicate, or has purchased the<br>
Dewar holding Walt Disney, or maybe that he was the one who<br>
shot down TWA 800.<br>
