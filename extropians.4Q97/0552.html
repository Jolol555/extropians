<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In my opinion, this bull market is a bubble if I ever saw one.  People</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; buying a stock in expectation that it will rise, rather than in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; expectation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; receiving dividends.  The only way to make money on this stock market</i><br>
<i>&gt;is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; if</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; someone else pays an equal amount of money.  In short, it's a pyramid</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; scheme,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not an investment strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Eliezer, this is an interesting analysis, and there's some truth to it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;However, both Price/Earning ratios and the overall bull market are more</i><br>
<i>&gt;complex issues than is often conceived.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, what level of P/E is healthy depends on the growth rate of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;company in which you're investing.  "Growth" companies with 20% annual</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit growth routinely have P/Es of 20-25, as you suggest (even in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;much less bullish market than we have currently).  Microsoft has had</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit growth rates ranging from 35-60% for the past 5 years. </i><br>
<p>
This is where most people screw up.  The current P/E is extrapolating<br>
stellar performance for more than a decade in the future.  Unfortunately,<br>
this extrapolation was based on data from a period that is known to be far<br>
outside the norm growth-wise.  Therefore, people who invest in companies<br>
with such wishful P/Es will not be able to collect a reasonable value for<br>
their investment for a very long time, if ever, especially if the market<br>
reverts to its historical behavior.<br>
<p>
Mutual funds are exhibiting the same problem.  3/4 of mutual funds today<br>
are 5 years old or younger, giving them an average return of 20-something%<br>
over the life of the fund.  A lot of people are buying into these funds<br>
thinking they will get bigger returns than if they invest in a fund that<br>
has been producing 13% over 75 years, when the opposite is generally true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, every year Microsoft (and Intel and other infotech companies)</i><br>
<i>&gt;inform Wall Street that they cannot maintain this level of revenue</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth indefinitely.  Then in the following year they maintain or even</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase their level of growth.  Thus the Street has stopped listening.</i><br>
<p>
Wall Street is stupid for not listening.  The growth was induced by broader<br>
market factors;  the growth inherent in the companies themselves wasn't as<br>
stellar as people think.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Second, your point about making money off of stock price rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;dividends is an excellent one that few people realize the significance</i><br>
<i>&gt;of.  What you may be missing is the potential of owning a stock to</i><br>
<i>&gt;realize future dividends at a higher rate.  Ie, I may purchase Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt;stock now in the interest of making dividends off of it 5 or 10 years</i><br>
<i>&gt;hence.  In this sense a high P/E ratio (and more generally inflated</i><br>
<i>&gt;stock prices as more money flows into the market) reflects longer-range</i><br>
<i>&gt;investing on the part of the public as a whole.  It also reflects a high</i><br>
<i>&gt;degree of confidence in future economic growth.  Which I'd expect you to</i><br>
<i>&gt;share.</i><br>
<p>
A high P/E stock is an inherently poor investment from the standpoint of<br>
dividends (effective return is less).  When you purchase a high P/E stock,<br>
you are essentially saying that you expect the stock to maintain or exceed<br>
its current level of growth some number of years in the future, usually a<br>
decade or more.  I strongly believe that it is insane to try and predict<br>
the growth of a tech company a decade or more in advance.  It is<br>
effectively impossible.  No rational investor would claim to be able to do<br>
this, but most investors claim as much by their actions.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An awful lot of money has moved into the stock market in the past few</i><br>
<i>&gt;years as interest rates have stayed low and bonds have been shown to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;a less effective long-term investment than stocks (they always were,</i><br>
<i>&gt;even when interest rates were moderate).  Analysts expect an even larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;influx over the next 10-20 years as the baby boomers begin to inherit</i><br>
<i>&gt;and invest money from their parents generation.  The larger the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;of money invested in stocks, the higher prices will be overall.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To be clear, let me add that I think the current market is overvalued. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps by as much as 50%.  A market correction may wipe out a year or</i><br>
<i>&gt;more of gains.  Nevertheless, for the investor with a horizon of at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least 5 years, and preferably 10 or more, infotech is a very savory</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment.</i><br>
<p>
Try this idea on for size:<br>
<p>
The market isn't overvalued.  The economy may very well support the current<br>
capitalization of the market.  What most people refer to as the<br>
overvaluation of the stock market is actually the *hyper-speculation* of<br>
the market.  People are making investments based on unsupportable<br>
speculative hypotheses.  A decade is a long time for a tech company.  The<br>
state of the stock market has less to do with the total value of the<br>
stocks, than with how well people are placing their money.  The myopic<br>
investment that is currently taking place may cause a stock market<br>
correction, but in no way will hinder the growth of companies or the economy.<br>
<p>
The market will continue to grow.  It just won't grow in the ways or in the<br>
stocks that people expect it to.<br>
