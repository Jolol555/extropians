I'm aware that hemp has uses. :)<br>
<p>
And I think as an economic crop, hemp qua crop makes sense. Trying to get it<br>
accepted is another matter, a propaganda matter.<br>
<p>
However, regarding hemp qua fuel: inasmuch as hemp still has to be cultivated,<br>
there's an energy cost associated with that. Assuming hemp is as efficient as<br>
soybeans at generating oil (that seems like a conservative estimate), and<br>
assuming similar cultivation/processing costs (not sure this is true), a first<br>
approximation of the energy credit (or debt) ought to be easily calculable. I<br>
don't have the numbers at present. But we don't see a lot of soybean-powered<br>
cars, do we? Now if hemp were incredibly better as a fuel, or incredibly cheaper<br>
to cultivate, this use might still pan out. I'm curious to know if the book you<br>
mention goes into this, or just handwaves about it.<br>
<p>
I'll try to look up that book. Have you got an ISDN number handy? Thanks.<br>
