I'm no naval architect or marine engineer, but as an admiralty lawyer, I play<br>
one in the courtroom.  Seriously, I've qualified a few such folks as expert<br>
witnesses and know many more.  Based on this . . .<br>

<i>&gt; There appears to be an engineering problem with the design, namely the</i><br>
size.<br>
<p>
My first thought when I immediately visited the referenced web site, as well.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; [snip] At some point the stresses will tear the ship apart.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Very large ships, such as supertankers ( which are much smaller than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Freedom Ship" ), are very fragile and have to be loaded in a manner that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  distributes the mass evenly throughout the ship.  A momentary increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mass in one part of the ship can cause the ship to rip itself in half.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Sailing through rough seas with a less than optimally balanced load will</i><br>
do<br>
<i>&gt;  the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
Very, very true.  See the famous case of the M/V DERBYSHIRE, perhaps one of<br>
the most scientifically investigated ship losses in history.  She went down<br>
with all hands apparently instantaneously when her back broke from uneven<br>
forces as James describes, or so the British Board of Admiralty concluded<br>
after ten years of expert inquiry.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  According to the resume on the site, the guy who designed the "Freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Ship" did not have the design of very large water-craft in his engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;  expertise.  </i><br>
<p>
Naval architecture is a REAL specialty in engineering.  I wouldn't go aboard<br>
a canoe designed by someone who wasn't well versed in its arcana and<br>
certainly not one designed by someone who wouldn't claim a few other hull<br>
designs to his credit.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  A more feasible design would be to either have a bunch of smaller floating</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objects connected non-rigidly, or to make the structure stacked *a lot*</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shorter (minimize vertical pressure) so that the superstructure will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  capable of withstanding the buoyant forces.  A structure that is both long</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *and* tall simply won't work.  Either way, it will be a serious compromise</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to his "ideal" design.</i><br>
<p>
Multiple hulls is definitely the way to go for very large structures,<br>
especially ones that can encounter uneven loads or that must withstand very<br>
heavy weather, although one pays a price in hydrodynamic drag as a result.<br>
See the design of semi-submersible drilling rigs.<br>
<p>
Adding to the list of design problems obvious even to the informed layman,<br>
note the wave-catching prow (seemingly designed to MAXIMIZE hydrodynamic<br>
drag) and the extremely low freeboard (the height from the water to the first<br>
open deck).  Compare the latter to the design of modern cruise ships, which<br>
have very high freeboards.<br>
<p>
Also, the web site says the vessel will be built in the "Gulf of California"<br>
if my memory from last night serves.  I'm unaware of any shipyard in that<br>
area that could handle a project of these dimensions.  Such facilities are .<br>
.. rare, to say the least.<br>
<p>
Moving on from hardware to social software, I thought that the treatment of<br>
legal issues at the website was disturbingly scant.  The author acknowledges<br>
that the vessel will have to be flagged, but states that no flag has yet to<br>
be determined.  Since "the law of the flag" doctrine will carry significant<br>
legal implications for those who would commit to living and working aboard<br>
such a vessel, I would have thought there would be at least some more<br>
detailed discussion of this issue.  Furthermore, I would have expected that<br>
the avowedly laissez-faire attitude of the project would have required some<br>
nod in the direction of privately produced law or its equivalent, but I<br>
searched in vain for any reference to the subject.<br>
<p>
All these critical observations aside, on the other hand, I think the basic<br>
idea is one whose time has come.  I was recently told by a colleague about a<br>
condominium cruise ship concept similar to this but much smaller in scale<br>
that looks like it WILL happen.  BTW, the price of the vessel (similar in<br>
size to a conventional cruise ship) actually being built for that project is<br>
said to be $250 million.  The vessel described in the "Freedomship" web site<br>
would cost AT LEAST 4 time that much -- a gigabuck . . .<br>
