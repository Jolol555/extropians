Hello all,<br>
<p>
Yesterday we went to the Notary to sign the papers for Alcor.<br>
I explained my family what was expected of them by signing<br>
these papers. Some of the papers have their name on it and are not<br>
really necessary to complete the sign-up process. Still it can make a<br>
few things a whole lot easier, if you get their permission up front.<br>
<p>
The notary however started with a statement in which he said he<br>
didn't have much faith in the US-law and that he recommended them<br>
to re-read carefully once more. Regardless of this claim the atmosphere<br>
changed in the office, as you can imagine. To keep the discussion<br>
clear and free from a lot of emotions, I decided to not go ahead with these<br>
forms, and re-read/discuss them at home. We did sign the papers needed<br>
for me personal an I also learned that my testament/will (in English by<br>
Alcor)<br>
wasn't accepted by the Dutch law according to the notary.<br>
Again, I did go ahead to keep the process going, but I will investigate<br>
this<br>
of cause.<br>
<p>
My Sister had a good point though, which I also try to sort out.<br>
Since the papers of Alcor, ask some sort of "active" cooperation when <br>
you are found to be dead, she foresees to much involvement in a time<br>
when she's not in a "state" to help. This is by far the best reason to have<br>
our own network in the Netherlands. So that we can help each other, all<br>
people who really understand the wish, and see/feel what's at stake here.<br>
<p>
Anyway, for my own family matters and to inform people on our site, <br>
I hope some of you will share some of their experiences with me regarding<br>
the sign up process, and the involved relatives. All communication<br>
aspects regarding the above are welcomed, since I want to learn myself<br>
and inform others to the best of my knowledge. <br>
<p>
Thanks all,<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
