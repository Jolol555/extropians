<p>
  IAN: The identity of a thing encompasses the whole.<br>
  As such, TWA 800 is larger than TWA 800. On this list<br>
  the discourse, or should I say one-sided debate with<br>
  myself offering facts countered only by anti-intell-<br>
  ectual slop, has provided an important example of <br>
  barbarian-memetic-defense strategies.<br>
<p>
  Just as the immune systems of a cell defends its core<br>
  genetic code against invasive viri (that would attempt<br>
  to insert a new genetic code) with focused free-radical <br>
  bombardment, so too the immune system of the "authoritarian<br>
  cell" defends itself memetic code (truth by authoritarian<br>
  decree) against invasive memes with focused bombardment<br>
  of anti-personnel ad hominem fallacies: "crazy" "wako"<br>
  "paranoid" "get a life."<br>
<p>
  We've seen a beautiful display of that right here with my<br>
  non-insulting presentation of factual data countered with<br>
  a bombardment of anti-personnel ad hominem fallacies.<br>
<p>
  I find it as pathetic as I do fascinating. Only a memetic<br>
  code that was not logical, and which the host could detect<br>
  was not logical, would require recourse to self-defense by <br>
  resort to fallacy. A logical memetic code would require <br>
  only the use of logic to test competing memes. <br>
<p>
<p>
  I've offered the Navy-missile theory, while based on facts,<br>
  not as a fact itself. I have encouraged others to test it<br>
  with logic -- it could be false. Unfortunately all those <br>
  who test it, test not it but ME with personal attacks.<br>
  This is itself a situation larger than TWA 800, it <br>
  stands as a shinning example of inquiry vs insult,<br>
  facts vs fallacies, theory vs thuggery, proposition <br>
  vs persecution, civility vs barbarism.<br>
<p>
  When challenging "truth by authoritarian decree"<br>
  what else should one expect? Expecting otherwise<br>
  was my mistake in pursuing this line of inquiry.<br>
<p>
