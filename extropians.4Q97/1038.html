<i>&gt; Holger Wagner (Holger.Wagner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de) said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I was wondering if anybody on this lists knows about *scientific*</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;approaches to some of the phenomena most people consider mystical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Things like out-of-body-experiences, spontanuous recovery from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sicknesses, witchcraft and so on.</i><br>
<p>
I see two approaches to all of this. The first is to use the usual<br>
methodology of study involving double blinds and the like, all of which<br>
have resulted in no measurable effects. The second is to regard these as<br>
experiences within the brain, with the unfortunate phenomenon of these<br>
experiences being "absolute" or "more real" than normal experience.<br>
Those untrained in scientific methodology and unaware of the ease with<br>
which unconscious emotional needs and alter the meaning of experiences<br>
fall into the trap of thinking that this "absolute" aspect is physically<br>
true.<br>
<p>
I also caution you to note that your list has quite a few items there.<br>
OBEs are probably brain states. Spontaneous healing is more complex;<br>
does my recovery from the flu qualify?? And witchcraft is a combination<br>
of herbal healing, which can be seen as applied pharmacology using<br>
plants, trance and hypnosis, which is also sometimes valid, and<br>
religion, another area entirely.....<br>
