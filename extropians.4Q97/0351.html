Thanks to John Clark for summarizing Drexler's plan for evolving super<br>
intelligence:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A recipe for intelligence: Build a simulated world in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer and fill  it with very simple creatures (programs).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Make sure they must solve problems  in order to get "food". The</i><br>
<i>&gt; creatures that are better at solving problems  leave more</i><br>
<i>&gt; descendants. Now you do nothing, just step back and let it </i><br>
<i>&gt; evolve. After evolving for a few hundred  million SIMULATED years </i><br>
<i>&gt; you have intelligence, high order intelligence.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How long would it take in real years? He calculated the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; of computer  power needed to  simulate ALL the brains that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever existed before humanity, that is, all the  brains since</i><br>
<i>&gt; brains were invented in the Cambrian Explosion 570 million years</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago. He concluded that  10^38 machine instructions would do the</i><br>
<i>&gt; trick. A  Nanotechnology computer the size of a large present</i><br>
<i>&gt; day factory and using no  more power, could perform 10^38</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine instructions in about 2 years. </i><br>
<p>
Without seeing Drexler's original proposal, it is hard to evaluate this in<br>
detail.  But taking it literally as presented, there is an obvious flaw.<br>
Just simulating the *brains* which have existed would not be enough to<br>
evolve intelligence.  Brains don't just become intelligent on their own.<br>
What makes them become intelligent is the challenge presented to the<br>
brains by the environment.  Brains which evolve in such a way that they<br>
are able to better survive and reproduce will become more numerous.<br>
<p>
So it would be necessary to simulate not only the brains, but the bodies<br>
and the environment where the brains interact.  We'd have to simulate<br>
competition, the challenges of survival.  Frogs need tongues and flies<br>
to evolve brains which will try to predict the flies' motion.  Apes need<br>
hands, trees, branches, vines, and a reason to jump from tree to tree to<br>
evolve brains which can let them leap through the air and catch a branch.<br>
<p>
A brute force technique, then, would have to simulate not only the brains,<br>
but potentially a significant subset of the biosphere.  This would be many<br>
orders of magnitude more difficult.  Volume considerations alone would<br>
suggest 4 or 5 orders of magnitude (what fraction of the biosphere is<br>
made of brains?).  A complicating factor is that the kinds of simulation<br>
necessary or appropriate for things like muscles, trees and rivers may be<br>
fundamentally different than the presumably neural-net based simulations<br>
we would prefer to use for brains (and which probably formed the basis<br>
of Drexler's estimate).<br>
<p>
The idea of evolving intelligence does seem to have potential, and may<br>
turn out to be the easiest way of developing AI.  I'm sure that Drexler's<br>
example is not meant literally, but is intended to motivate the intuition<br>
that given nanocomputers, it should become practical to evolve AI.  This<br>
may still be the case even if the example doesn't go all the way towards<br>
establishing the point.<br>
