I wrote-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; By saying "I should learn," one implies that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; we all should learn to adapt to bad designs,</i><br>
<p>
And Lee Daniel Crocker replied-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I love this analogy...I might point out, though, that it applies</i><br>
<i>&gt;equally well to institutions of society as it does to</i><br>
<i>&gt;items of technology...</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  Although institutions are more evolved than designed.<br>
Somehow it's even more frustrating when people accept the<br>
random offenses of the design of some anonymous nerd, than<br>
when they cave in to bad ideas that have the weight of tradition<br>
behind them.  It's a spectrum, though: think of architecture,<br>
computer standards and conventions, government forms, road signs...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My favorite quote along those line's is Krishnamurti's:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "It is no sign of mental health to be well-adjusted</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to a profoundly sick society."</i><br>
<p>
!! and a world full of minor, repeating annoyances is profoundly sick<br>
in a way that people fail to notice.  Thanks for the quote.<br>
