9. GENETICS OF AGING<br>
There may be controversy over the importance of genetics versus<br>
environment in the human aging process, but there is no<br>
controversy about the dominant rule of genetics as the<br>
determinant in aging differences between species. Man lives 72<br>
years, the cat lives 15 years, the mouse lives 27 months, the<br>
fruit fly lives 40 days, and the nematode worm lives 15 days --<br>
the differences attributable to the differences in genomes.<br>
Nevertheless, beyond the attribution to genetics, there is almost<br>
nothing known about the particular genes involved, and even less<br>
about any proteins expressed by these genes. Within the human<br>
species, there are also many primary mysteries of the aging<br>
process waiting to be solved. Why, for example, in Alzheimer's<br>
disease, a neurodegenerative disease with a heavy genetic<br>
component, is it common to have the onset of Alzheimer's disease<br>
in identical twins differ by many years? The present consensus<br>
among researchers is that within a species 35% of the variance in<br>
the aging process is determined by genetic factors and 65% by<br>
environmental factors. Caleb E. Finch and Rudolph E. Tanzi<br>
(University of Southern California, US; Massachusetts General<br>
Hospital, Boston US), in a review of current research in the<br>
genetics of the aging process, suggest the role of genetics in<br>
determining life-span is complex and paradoxical, and that life-<br>
style and other environmental influences may profoundly modify<br>
the effects of genetic factors. This is clearly a field searching<br>
for its watershed. QY: C. E. Finch, Univ. Southern Calif., Biol.<br>
Sci. (213) 740-2777 (Science 17 Oct 1997)<br>

10. LIFE HISTORY OF NEURONS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN<br>
There are a number of critical questions concerning the aging of<br>
the human brain, among them: 1) How is the normal aging of nerve<br>
cells different from the normal aging of other cells? 2) How are<br>
the changes seen in normally aging nerve cells different from the<br>
changes seen in nerve cells affected by neurodegenerative<br>
disease? 3) How is the normal aging of nerve cells affected by<br>
systemic factors such as hormone levels? These are 3 important<br>
areas of research in the biology of the aging process, and it is<br>
apparent that important data will be appearing in the next<br>
decade. There is preliminary evidence, for example, that estrogen<br>
plays a protective role against aging changes in nerve cells.<br>
John H. Morrison and Patrick R. Hof (Mt. Sinai School of<br>
Medicine, NY US) review the differences between pathogenic neuron<br>
loss in the human brain and neuron loss due to the normal aging<br>
process, and the authors suggest that primary neurobiological<br>
substrates for functional impairment in aging differ in important<br>
ways from those in neurodegenerative disorders such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease. They emphasize that it is an error to<br>
consider the normal aging of the brain and Alzheimer's disease as<br>
part of the same continuum of senescence. QY: J. H. Morrison<br>

11. THE ENDOCRINOLOGY OF AGING<br>
Hormones are signaling molecules secreted into the blood stream<br>
by endocrine cells and acting on target cells that possess<br>
receptors for the hormone. They have long been a subject of<br>
research, testosterone having first been discovered in 1848. At<br>
present, there are dozens of different vertebrate hormones that<br>
have been identified, ranging from relatively low molecular<br>
weight hormones such as steroids to peptide hormones such as<br>
prolactin with nearly 200 amino acids in the peptide chain. One<br>
essential fact concerning the signaling with which hormones are<br>
involved is that hormones do not act in isolation. Nerve cells<br>
can trigger the release of hormones and local chemical mediators,<br>
hormones can influence nerve cells and trigger the release of<br>
local chemical mediators and other hormones, and local chemical<br>
mediators can modify the response of target tissues to the<br>
actions of hormones. All of which partly explains the complexity<br>
of endocrinology as a research area. Steven W. J. Lamberts et al<br>
(3 authors at Erasmus University, NL), in a review of the<br>
endocrinology of aging, point out that physiological changes have<br>
usually been the focus when considering the aging process, but<br>
there is evidence these changes are due to important reductions<br>
in certain blood hormones that occur during aging in both men and<br>
women. Replacement therapy, however, has not yet proven to be<br>
both safe and beneficial. QY: S. W. J.  Lamberts<br>
