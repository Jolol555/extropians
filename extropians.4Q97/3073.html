<i>&gt; Dr. Alice Miller's hypothesis has descriptive power (how things are); </i><br>
<i>&gt; explanatory power (why things get to be that way); and predictive power </i><br>
<i>&gt; (how things will get to be that way); and this is all we can ever ask </i><br>
<i>&gt; from any scientific hypothesis.  It has meaning; and it has content, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and -- best of all -- It's empirically testable and _falsifiable_.</i><br>
<p>
Then I suppose I'll have to read it now.  All I was trying<br>
to say is that your earlier description of the book made me want<br>
to run from it.  This one makes me want to read it.  Look at<br>
those two descriptions and you'll see why, and perhaps if you<br>
think some other book is worthy of my time, you'll stick to<br>
descriptions like this one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And the damaged children and the damaged adults are all around us, for </i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone to see who can bear to look at them.  Why is it that I get </i><br>
<i>&gt; this feeling that Lee Daniel Crocker _doesn't want to look_?</i><br>
<p>
If it's a good work, I'll look.  But when I see a label on some herb<br>
that says "Increases energy, boosts the immune system, burns fat,<br>
grows hair, smoothes wrinkles, and makes your children behave",<br>
my reaction is to hold on to my wallet. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Here's my standard offer:</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Buy the book.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Read it.  Or even have someone whose judgement you trust</i><br>
<i>&gt;    read it for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Come back to us, and if you can honestly say the book and the time </i><br>
<i>&gt;    taken to read it were wasted for you, I'll refund the full price.</i><br>
<p>
No need for the offer.  I just wanted a description that didn't<br>
sound like a snake-oil pitch, and this one was sufficient.<br>
