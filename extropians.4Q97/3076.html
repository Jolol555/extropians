&lt; But there are some complications: for example, if<br>
we're saying that torturing kids turns them violent<br>
how come the German burgher was so law-abiding? (Or<br>
was he? Is that just a myth? Or is it that all that<br>
pent-up burgher's aggression burst out in two World<br>
Wars?) &gt;<br>
<p>
Sounds, in some ways, like my ancestors on the<br>
18th-century island of Nantucket, which I was just<br>
reading about last week. Although I have no<br>
information on their child-rearing practices (I<br>
suspect children were forcefully compelled to carry<br>
on traditions, probably in ways that might be<br>
considered 'torturous' today - in the psychological<br>
sense rather than any kind of physical mutilation),<br>
socially they sound similar to these German burghers. <br>
<p>
Nathaniel Philbrick's _Away Off Shore: Nantucket<br>
Island and Its People, 1602-1890_ (1994) notes the<br>
paradox that 18th-century Nantucket whalers and<br>
traders were "some of the deadliest, most conniving<br>
hunters the earth has ever known, [but yet] they were<br>
Quakers, a sect that stood against war and conflict<br>
and anything that might excite undue emotions".<br>
<p>
Still IMO, they exhibited many extropian<br>
characteristics for their time: disdain for remote<br>
government and organized religion, strong<br>
individualism, a rational and business-like approach<br>
to most affairs - their treatment of women, Native<br>
and African Americans was also relatively enlightened<br>
compared to other Europeans in America at the time.<br>
<p>
Philbrick also relates: "Nantucket had its share of<br>
brutal and inhumane whaling captains ... by 1830 the<br>
whalemen's debaucheries in the Sandwich Islands were<br>
already public knowledge ... for the Nantucketer, the<br>
whale was not so much a living, breathing creature as<br>
it was, according to one commentator, 'a<br>
self-propelled tub of high-income lard' ".<br>
<p>
Yet, back on their island, while the Quaker culture<br>
insisted on business-like manners and prohibited<br>
public displays of emotion, at the same time it seems<br>
to have encouraged a kind of pent-up ferocity and<br>
intolerance toward any who did not see things their<br>
own way.<br>
