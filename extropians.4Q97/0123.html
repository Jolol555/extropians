<p>
O.K. have at it.  In setting your personal values as a "code of morality",<br>
does it not logically follow that anyone who holds a personal preference, or<br>
preferences, different from yours is considered by you to hold "immoral<br>
values?" You say chocolate ice cream, another wants vanilla; you say brick<br>
house, another prefers frame; you say no theft, another says steal.   What<br>
you have not said is by what rationale your values and preferences are<br>
superior as implied by your declaration. If all other individuals are not<br>
afforded the same claim of "morality" via personal preferences, don't you<br>
feel obliged to explain how and why they are excluded from the criteria you<br>
assert as fact for yourself? If each is afforded the same criteria, and each<br>
individual is of equal standing, if in a given instance you say "moral" and<br>
another says "immoral", do we not have a sum, zero; meaning that the term,<br>
morality, has no  meaning? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future</i><br>
<i>&gt;behavior. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be reasonably</i><br>
<i>&gt;sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all</i><br>
<i>&gt;safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it</i><br>
<i>&gt;very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.</i><br>
<p>
To be sure, you, I, and\or anyone else may agree not to steal, nor initiate<br>
force and coercion in any way. This will, as you say, result in a peaceful<br>
coexistence. I have no quarrel with the conclusion. The conclusion is<br>
reflected in natural law as pertains to means and ends. The means selected<br>
and applied are right because they result in the end mutually desired and<br>
identified. Here choosing and implementing right means (suited to the<br>
purpose) you call "morally right." However, suppose we agree to steal and<br>
produce a hostile coexistence?  Once again, the means selected and applied<br>
produces the end mutually desired and identified. Would you then call this<br>
"morally wrong" although you agreed to it? <br>
<p>
Let's look at the third option: Suppose the end you choose is peaceful<br>
coexistence and select the appropriate means, non theft, etc. to achieve<br>
this end, but another within your social realm prefers a hostile enviroment<br>
and selects predatory means appropriate to achieve this end. Since the<br>
predatory means chosen will produce the hostile environment end desired, are<br>
not these means chosen technically right the same as yours are technically<br>
right? What remains for you to call wrong, and why? The end chosen, is it<br>
not? Thus must you presume to qualify terms, and arrive at: Technically<br>
right, but "morally wrong." Right AND wrong applied to the same<br>
circumstance?  True, yet false? Exist, yet does not exist? Dead, yet alive?<br>
Doesn't this make you a bit suspicious of the concept, morality?  <br>
<p>
The confusion, conflicts and contradictions are derived from illusory<br>
beliefs that lead to pursuit of the impossible. An end chosen is a matter of<br>
volition, a natural condition that is not subject to proof or disproof. It<br>
is means and only means that are subject to evaluation as right or wrong. To<br>
presume to evaluate a chosen end as right or wrong is to claim the<br>
individual creator of said end as personal property to be evaluated as means<br>
to one's own goal. <br>
<p>
So, what is "morality", that is  what is the meaning of the term, and by<br>
reference to what is the meaning derived? I can find not a trace of<br>
objective criteria except subjective personal preference as you acknowledge.<br>
Ergo, "morality" is dependent on being created by individual mind. Having<br>
examined and weighed all the factors known to me from root premise to end<br>
result, I  am obliged to accept the definition that corresponds to the evidence:<br>
<p>
Morality is a FEELING; specifically a DOMINANT feeling of a "universal<br>
ought" nearly universally felt. It is a feeling that there exists an<br>
objective and universal standard of values. It is a feeling that one "ought"<br>
to discover and live by these values. It is a feeling that most individual's<br>
look to and depend on to measure their self value and the value of others.<br>
It is a feeling that directs thoughts, conclusions, beliefs and actions like<br>
no other. It is the ultimate warden of the psyche. It is the ultimate<br>
religion for it commands more subservience of more individuals that all the<br>
others put together.<br>
<p>
Since "morality" is a matter of feelings peculiar to each individual, (but<br>
believed to be an objective dictate of nature), is it any wonder that the<br>
endless disagreements are endlessly "resolved" by violent conflict?  The<br>
concept, morality, is by billions believed to be an absolute necessity for<br>
peaceful coexistence. They believe this even as the earth has been for<br>
centuries, and still is, drenched in blood in the name of morality. This<br>
tells not of any truth of "morality", but of a suicidal and destructive<br>
commitment to a revered and  dominant fallacy. "Morality" is just one of the<br>
many popular beliefs that are 180 out of phase with reality. For more, see  <br>
