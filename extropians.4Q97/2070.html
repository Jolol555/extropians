ExI members paid $25 less for EXTRO 3 than non-members. Membership at that<br>
time was at a low of $30 (down from the previous $45). That meant that for<br>
members who came to the conference, the remainder of their membership<br>
benefits cost only $5. If you can get a members' newsletter, posting<br>
ability to the list, entry to local meetings, and other benefits for only<br>
$5, that's pretty good. For those going to the conference, becoming members<br>
of ExI almost completely paid for itself.<br>

<p>
If you want them to wait *at* your bedside, that's quite a bit extra. :-)<br>
Another comparison -- with another networking organization -- the<br>
International Interactive Communications Society. The last time I checked,<br>
annual dues were $125. Anyway, for the ExI dues, you do get the regular<br>
(not just emergency) services of a trained extropian team in your media!<br>

<p>
It already is accomplishing something, Daniel. If it weren't for our<br>
members (especially those who have supported the organization beyond the<br>
minimums) we would not be in existence. There would not have been the very<br>
considerable amount of media exposure to these ideas, there would not be<br>
conferences, and there would not be some of the offshoot activity including<br>
other organizations that are starting up. At the very least, members will<br>
allow us to keep doing what we've been doing. If we can increase<br>
membership, *then* we can realistically consider doing more. I always<br>
welcome suggestions for what else we could be doing (do you have<br>
suggestions Daniel?) but such suggestions cannot be acted on without<br>
resources.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
