      I don't think that has to be true.<br>
      <br>
      First, you don't distinguish between aggression, and violence.  They <br>
      aren't the same thing.  Aggression has biological and psychological <br>
      functionality.  Violence may not.  In a world where children are <br>
      treated as chattels of their parents, and subjected on a horrifying <br>
      to abuse and 'child-control' procedures of stupefying cruelty and <br>
      destructiveness (usually 'for their own good', natch), it's not <br>
      morally possible or socially-practicable to take a 'laissez-faire' <br>
      position.  If we don't protect your kids' bodies and minds <br>
      adequately, they can grow up to kill or enslave _us_.<br>
<p>
      <br>
      Second, you don't really take into account the use of social <br>
      innovation to address these problems.  I advance the idea that <br>
      _no-one_ has a _right_ to impose upon another person a _risk_ of <br>
      harm that cannot be fully and immediately compensated for (on a <br>
      standard indifference-curve restitutive basis).<br>
<p>
      <br>
      In practice, this means that everyone gets to carry fully-reinsured <br>
      insurance cover for the harm that they may inflict on other people. <br>
      For people who in practice _don't_ inflict harm on others, the <br>
      insurance is trivially cheap -- a few dollars a year.  Premiums rise <br>
      in line with claims records; and if claims of certain kinds get out <br>
      of hand (hurting people in bar fights, say), insurers may impose <br>
      restrictions -- like staying clear of alcohol, etc., unless all the <br>
      barflies consent to the risk of harm.  Insurers may also <br>
      specify recovery of claims payouts from the offender.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Also: you could readily get insurance for concealed-carry of a 9mm. <br>
      Browning Hi-Power, -- but probably _not_, for toting a thermonuclear <br>
      suitcase bomb.  This seems eminently sensible.  &gt;:-}<br>
