Steve Witham:<br>
<i>&gt;Like I said, smart thinking isn't the same as having a critique.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He is specifically challenging us to come up with a critique of tech.  </i><br>
<p>
I see an underlying question:<br>
Should Extropians devise a critique on tech in response to Bey, or <br>
should we devise one for our own reasons?  I think that many <br>
Extropians would like to move beyond the reactionary style that <br>
characterizes current public debate.  Actually, after all the raves I <br>
hear about Bey, it somewhat disappoints he would appeal to this style.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is the extropian critique of tech?  The critical thinking implied </i><br>
<i>&gt;in "Dynamic Optimism?"  It would have to be more specific than that.</i><br>
<p>
So many areas of Extropian and transhumanist thought are wide open <br>
for development, and this area presents an excellent opportunity for <br>
someone who is interested in it (like, say, Steve!).  I've been <br>
tossing around an idea for writing about our relationship with the <br>
Luddites and how it could benefit us, but it keeps getting put on the <br>
back burner.<br>
