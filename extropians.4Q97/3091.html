<i>&gt;Yes, some kind of "responsibility Turing test" might be needed. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;it could consist of several scenarios the requester is confronted</i><br>
<i>&gt;with, and its actions are studied, especially when asked to predict or</i><br>
<i>&gt;extend the scenario. For example, the child might be asked "How will</i><br>
<i>&gt;you pay for food and rent if we make you an adult?". </i><br>
<p>
I like the idea, but it would have to be modified.  This test<br>
measures whether one should be extended a 'privilege', not whether an<br>
entity should be extended a 'right'.  The two terms tend to get used<br>
interchangeably when in fact they represent two different concepts. <br>
The conferrence of adult status through artifical means is a<br>
privilege, not a right, although the conferrence of it may have a<br>
basis in some rights, such as the right to self-determination or the<br>
right to free passage.  (Normal growth into adulthood is not <br>
considered a right, although some activists are pushing for the <br>
recognition of exercise of reproductive functions as a right.)<br>
<p>
The Western concept of 'rights' has never been predicated on a base<br>
of understanding of the consequences or results of having that right,<br>
as the concept includes the quality of inherentness.  In other words,<br>
an entity that has rights is born/created/built with them from<br>
inception.  Later on, as the entity grows, develops and learns,<br>
privileges (such as operating a vehicle, holding a job or<br>
participation in civic structures) are conferred based on that level<br>
of responsibility. <br>
<p>
If this sounds confusing, one method of distinguishing a 'right' from<br>
a 'privilege' is to ask:  is it open-ended or concrete? Privileges<br>
tend toward the concrete and practical;  rights tend toward the<br>
conceptual and developmental.  Another method is to consider the<br>
causal relationship:  privileges often stem from rights, but rights<br>
never stem from privileges.<br>
