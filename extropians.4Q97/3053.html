   This discussion is really disappointing me.<br>
<p>
   Dr. Alice Miller's book is outstanding, and brilliant.  Trailblazing.<br>
<p>
   Am I failing to explain what it is that she says so well?<br>
<p>
  Or am I dealing with a know-nothing who can't understand basic English, <br>
  and is simply indifferent to resolving one of the world's most difficult <br>
  problems? Problems which adversely affect the achievement of extropian <br>
  goals and damage present and potential extropians personally?  A problem <br>
  which can terminate all human life on the planet, given the existence <br>
  of some 40 000 nuclear weapons...<br>
<p>
  To say it again:  Dr. Alice Miller advances a hypothesis which answers <br>
  the question: 'How would one have to raise a child, for it to grow up to <br>
  be a violent adult?'<br>
<p>
  Degrading dormouse--talk for the dormouse:  This is not the same as <br>
  advancing a hypothesis to explain all violent adult behaviour.<br>
<p>
   For 'advanced' dormice: 'necessary condition' and 'sufficient <br>
   condition' are logically different ...<br>
<p>
   Dr. Alice Miller's hypothesis has descriptive power (how things are); <br>
   explanatory power (why things get to be that way); and predictive power <br>
   (how things will get to be that way); and this is all we can ever ask <br>
   from any scientific hypothesis.  It has meaning; and it has content, <br>
   and -- best of all -- It's empirically testable and _falsifiable_.<br>
<p>
   Furthermore, the thesis is painstakingly researched, with extensive <br>
   quotation and citation, and it is written with passion and clarity and <br>
   attention to detail.  It's a classic.<br>
<p>
   Frankly, I don't know what more any scientific thesis is supposed to <br>
   offer.  Especially in the 'social sciences.'<br>
<p>
   Dr. Alice Miller demonstrates convincingly that there is no shortage of <br>
   evidence -- the blasted German pedagogical writers wrote horrifying <br>
   manuals describing in appalling detail how to _torture_ children into <br>
   submission and plasticity.  Just as the slave-breakers did in the <br>
   American South.<br>
<p>
<p>
   And the damaged children and the damaged adults are all around us, for <br>
   everyone to see who can bear to look at them.  Why is it that I get <br>
   this feeling that Lee Daniel Crocker _doesn't want to look_?<br>
 <br>
<p>
   Sure, we all have our 'monster-barring' screening and 'touchstone' <br>
   theories.  Sure, intuituion can be very valuable, not least since it <br>
   incorporates tacit or unarticulated knowledge.<br>
<p>
<p>
   What I cannot understand is how Lee Daniel Crocker can be so little <br>
   interested in this problem.  If he waits until he has children of his <br>
   own, it'll likely be too late.  He'll either bring his kids up the way <br>
   he was brought up; or he'll make a conscious effort to bring them up <br>
   differently.  If he thinks he can master this subject in a few years, <br>
   he's simply living in a dream-world, and will believe anything.<br>
 <br>
   Here's my standard offer:<br>
<p>
   Buy the book.<br>
<p>
   Read it.  Or even have someone whose judgement you trust read it for <br>
   you.<br>
<p>
   Come back to us, and if you can honestly say the book and the time <br>
   taken to read it were wasted for you, I'll refund the full price.<br>
<p>
   In gold.<br>
<p>
   And just pass the book on to someone who has a better chance of <br>
   understanding it, is all I ask.<br>
