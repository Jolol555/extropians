Have a bad day yesterday Michael?<br>
<p>
The composite body of a Hypercar is not paper-mache thin, and in<br>
fact its monocoque construction makes it much stronger than a<br>
conventional car and probably your 1/2 ton pickup. It will not<br>
crumple like tissue paper.<br>
<p>
If I could not stop short of the Moose, I would accelerate. (law of<br>
inertia you know.) letting Mr Moose with his now broken legs land<br>
behind me.<br>
<p>
Lets say I did stop short of this moose. I'd either try and reverse<br>
my course, or sit there quietly and wait for him/her to pass.<br>
<p>
If threatened, I'd reach for my trusty Oneida Strike Eagle, notch<br>
a 33.5", 3316 alloy shaft, thunderhead 125 equipped arrow, and<br>
convert Mr bad attitude into 1100lbs of steaks, chops, and<br>
mooseburger. After all it's the law (at least in Alaska) than you<br>
have to salvage a game animal if killed (even if struck by a<br>
vehicle). Maybe a nice new full length moosehide jacket and<br>
moccasins as well.<br>
<p>
He wouldn't be the first, nor last.<br>
