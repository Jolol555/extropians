<p>
<i>&gt;From my transhuman dictionary:</i><br>
<p>
UPLIFT: To increase the intelligence and help develop a culture of a<br>
previously non- or near-intelligent species. [From the Uplift novels<br>
by David Brin]<br>
<p>
UPLOAD: (a) To transfer the consciousness and mental structure of a<br>
person from a biological matrix to an electronic or informational<br>
matrix (this assumes that the strong AI postulate holds). The term<br>
"Downloading" is also sometimes used, mainly to denote transferring<br>
the mind to a slower or less spacious matrix. (b) The resulting<br>
infomorph person. [The origin of the term is uncertain, but obviously<br>
based on the computer technology term 'uploading' (loading data into a<br>
mainframe computer).]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Seems pretty scary thinking about it,...if God decides that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have gone to far and calls it quits on us .... : " Closing time ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; gentlemen ...  !!! " heh heh</i><br>
<p>
In that case we'll start our own shop next door with competitive prices.<br>
