Well, not always, but generally.  Here there are ways, they're<br>
just very hard and far beyond our current abilities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about transplanting the spine with the head.</i><br>
<p>
No dice with this system; they leave the old brain stem in<br>
place to run the body.  They have to leave the old spine too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about growing a new tailored spinal cord for implantation?</i><br>
<p>
You still need to interface the new spine to the transplanted<br>
brain; the details of spinal neuron distribution is determined<br>
primarily by development variation and not genes.  Plus you now<br>
need to interface the new spinal cord to the body and the <br>
conserved brain stem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about cybernetics?</i><br>
<p>
Probably the best strategy for the interface but we can't yet<br>
even restore the sensation to the tip of my brother's ring finger<br>
(lost when somebody squashed his finger in a boat hatch).<br>

<p>
I never said that it was impossible; just impossible now.  In the<br>
future, it will become possible, but it will probably still be <br>
easier to replace individual organs with cultured clones as necessary.<br>
Of course, resetting the Hayflick limit may turn out to be very hard<br>
too, in which case I'd be wrong.<br>
