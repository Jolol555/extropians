Frankly, a couple of seconds thought should give you enough proof. When<br>
was the last time you heard of a drive-by shooting by a tobacconist or<br>
liquor store owner? When drugs are legal, drug dealers are too busy<br>
collecting money from their customers to worry about shooting each<br>
other.<br>
<p>
Of course there are dangers: there was a drive-by shooting between<br>
alcohol and tobacco smugglers in England earlier this year, as<br>
thanks to the oppressive British taxes they can make tens of thousands<br>
of dollars just by taking a van through the Channel Tunnel and bringing<br>
it back loaded up with cheap alcohol and cigarettes from the <br>
Continent. So legal drugs with high taxes are still a problem; and<br>
as a Canadian I'm sure you're aware of the level of cross-border<br>
smuggling of legal drugs from the US into your country. From what<br>
I hear that's not entirely violence-free either.<br>
<p>
First big murder to hit the headlines in England after the handgun ban <br>
happened late one night just outside London; a driver apparently got<br>
annoyed by the car in front and rammed it several times, finally <br>
pushing it across onto the other side of the highway, where it was hit<br>
by a car coming the other way which killed everyone inside. Really lucky<br>
they didn't have handguns, eh?<br>
