The Encyclopedia Britannica claims that Linear A was a syllabic script<br>
dating "from approximately 1850 BC to 1400 BC."  Linear B is backdated to <br>
1600 B.C., with records dated from 1400 to 1200 B.C.  This doesn't seem<br>
consistent with Hebrew being the non-hieroglyphic writing in the world.<br>
<p>
I did some more Britannica reading after my last post on the subject.<br>
Semitic (at least Hebrew and Arabic) words -- morphemes -- are<br>
distinguished by their consonant patterns.  Interspersed vowels do have<br>
significance as inflections, but meaning is determined by the<br>
consonants.  So someone decided that they need only write down the<br>
consonants, leaving off tense and number inflections, perhaps similar to<br>
the way we used to leave out punctuation.  The article insists that this<br>
is a more usable system than it seems.  I can only defer to their more<br>
informed judgement.  Europe did do without punctuation or even word<br>
boundaries for a while.  (And Hebrew later came up with some vowel<br>
marks, although these seem like training wheels for literacy.)<br>
<p>
Scholars therefore disagree as to whether Aramaic should be called a<br>
syllabary which skips the vowels or an alphabet.  Apparently they've<br>
compromised and called it a "consonantal writing system" instead, which<br>
is certainly undeniable.  My speculations were confirmed: when the<br>
Greeks adopted the Semitic script, and discovered there weren't any<br>
symbols for vowels, rather important for word differentiation in Greek,<br>
they turned some symbols to vowel representation thus creating the first<br>
undeniable alphabet.  And the syllabary nature of the Linear scripts<br>
confirms my guess that left to their own devices the Greeks would have<br>
come up with syllabaries.  As Linear B has 90 signs and still can't<br>
handle consonant groups, we may be grateful for the alphabet's<br>
serendipitous birth.<br>
<p>
Which simply illustrates the unexpected benefits which may come from<br>
diversity, and perhaps cautions us against hasty standardization.<br>
Mnemosyne and Qwerty help us if the world had quickly adopted Chinese<br>
logographs.<br>
