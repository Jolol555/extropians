<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok...that sounds good....except I don't understand it...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What does BCC, FCD and HCP mean?  And what does Amorphous mean in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; context...</i><br>
<p>
BCC, FCD and HCP ar basically different crystalline structures that iron<br>
can assume, and which it assumes is dependent on the temperature and<br>
pressure the iron is under at the point which it is cooled, and whether<br>
it is rapidly quenched or allowed to cool slowly. Any basic book on<br>
metallurgy can tell you more on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Addittionally...how would this idea of a crystalline core tie in with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept of the  polarity of earths magnetic..."flipping' or reversing every so</i><br>
<i>&gt; often...how would (could) this happen...and what (if any) visible effect would</i><br>
<i>&gt; there be.?</i><br>
<p>
The presently accepted view of what causes the earth's electromagnetic<br>
field is that since the inner core rotates faster than the outer layers<br>
like the mantle and crust at a rate of about one extra "day" per year of<br>
rotation, the inner core acts as a rotor, and the mantle and crust as<br>
the stator, in an electromagnetic generator. THis differential also<br>
induces electrical currents in the lower mantle and outer core that<br>
interact with thermodynamically induced electrical currents. Since this<br>
speed differential is caused by the Moon having greater tidal influence<br>
on the outer layers than on the core, in that the moon induces a drag on<br>
the rotation of the outer layers, if anything were to cause the<br>
direction from which the moon exterts its tidal influence, like an<br>
asteroid strike on the moon changing its orbit, this would change the<br>
gyroscopic arrangement between the outer layers and the core, which<br>
would cause the inner core to appear to "tumble", which would been seen<br>
at the surface in the way of a flipping or occilating electromagnetic<br>
field. This tumbling effect could also be caused by a change in the<br>
flows of material in and out of the core and mantle areas. THey normally<br>
are rather cyclic, like any ocean thermal current, but oddidites can<br>
theoretically occur.<br>
<p>
What effect will this have for us? well, since the electromagnetic field<br>
is what protects us from most of the radiation the sun puts out, this<br>
could cause periods of radiation bombardment that could be dangerous,<br>
but most likely would not be any different than the levels found at the<br>
poles, or at least not much higher.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And just to throw a nother bean into the stew...how does Gold's Primeval Oil</i><br>
<i>&gt; thesis tie into this?</i><br>
<p>
What the hell is Gold's Primeval Oil thesis?????<br>
