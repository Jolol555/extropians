Dear fellow listmembers,<br>
<p>
Before I begin my composite reply to various listmembers I feel I have to<br>
apologoze to Tom for posting his correspondence with Berrie to the list.<br>
<p>
Tom, I you feel I have betrayed your trust by posting off-list<br>
correspondence I most humbly ask your pardon. I felt it was important to<br>
give a complete overview of the discussion to date. Being involved in the<br>
whole discussion myself I could not have been as objective had I refrained<br>
from quoting your mail. I can only hope you appreciate my attempt to<br>
objectively present the discussion to the best of my abilities. You have<br>
gone trough a lot of trouble in working on this problem with us and for<br>
that we owe you much respect and grattitude. Please let this not stand in<br>
the way of future cooperation.<br>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
And now for our regular program, some responses:<br>

<p>
I have no hard statistics about meme-speading in Europe, just my own<br>
Ex-perience (dangerous word?) of the last months. I travel a fair amount<br>
for work (I'm in switserland at the moment) and in all these months I've<br>
talked (in person and on the web) to a lot of people, none of them had ever<br>
heard of ExI or Transhumanism. It could be that I talk to the wrong people<br>
but I can't get over the feeling that the spreading of our memes still has<br>
a long way to go. Only the cryonics-meme is somewhat known, although is it<br>
generally not taken very seriously at this moment.<br>
<p>
I'll try to get hold of a recording of you Dutch TV appearance (looking<br>
forward!).<br>

<i> &gt;&gt;flexibility.</i><br>
<p>
Just so everybody is clear on this: Max was CC'd on the first mail so we<br>
feel he was informed, we truly feel we have been discussing the matter<br>
openly and contructively and hope you do to.<br>

<i> &gt;~Excedo's intentions for the name have been misunderstood, few can argue</i><br>

<p>
AS I said before, many ideals are indeed shared. Naming remains a point of<br>
discussion:<br>

<p>
Damien Broderick seems to have a more general problems with the letter X ;-)<br>
<p>
I've also received several off-list mails from listmembers telling me to<br>
stick with 'Excedo'. So it seems there is no consensus on this right now.<br>
I'll not reveal their more specific content, I've learned my lesson on that.<br>
  <br>
<i> &gt;For ~Excedo, one of the problems that could be encountered is</i><br>
<i> &gt;one of having to explain to all interested parties that there is truly *no*</i><br>
<i> &gt;association between Extropy and ~Excedo;</i><br>
<p>
But there is an association: our shared memes.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Perhaps more importantly is the</i><br>
<i> &gt;potential drawback for ExI. If ~Excedo generates *any* non-extropic ideas</i><br>
<i> &gt;whatsoever (and no-one knows as of yet how extropic ~Excedo's views are),</i><br>
<p>
You are all invited to visit our website (still under construction) at:<br>
    <a href="http://www.dse.nl/~excedo">http://www.dse.nl/~excedo</a>          (warning: it's mostly in Dutch ;-)<br>
And see for yourself. Both Max and Natascha are mentioned as is Anders<br>
Sandberg. We try not to take credit for anything we didn't make/think-up<br>
ourselves but anyone who feels wronged should: let us know. Any and all<br>
constructive comments are welcome.<br>

Sorry to make a big thing out of it but if is 'Excedo' is such a big<br>
problem, why is the above URl not confusing? No-one has given any answer to<br>
this repeatedly asked question, I'm really curious.<br>
<p>
 Tom Morrow &lt;phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu&gt;<br>
<i> &gt;Berrie and I have had cordial, but thus far inconclusive, discussions. He</i><br>
<i> &gt;and his friends evince good intentions, so I remain optimistic that we can</i><br>
<i> &gt;work out a suitable compromise.  Those of you new to this issue should keep</i><br>
<i> &gt;in mind that you may lack essential details; this is a complicated issue</i><br>
<i> &gt;(and should have remained, at least for now, a private one). I do not </i><br>
<i> &gt;have the time or inclination to educate everyone about what constitutes</i><br>
<i> &gt;the law, custom, and just plain old common courtesy in matters of </i><br>
<i> &gt;labelling, but I do hope that this email has clarified things a bit.</i><br>
<p>
Again: I am most sorry if you feel that Berrie or me betrayed your trust in<br>
us and we will make sure this never happens again. I am however curious why<br>
you feel this discussion should have remained private. <br>
<p>
If we all continue to work on this problem with your kind of attitude we<br>
will certainly find a suitable solution and get back to building things we<br>
believe in.<br>

<p>
We won't let it go that far I think ;-)<br>
I don't know if Tom is 'completely' out of line, but I'm glad you feel (as<br>
we do) that the chance of confusion is very small.<br>
<p>
I'm certain that we'll work this out, we have every intention of doing so<br>
and I believe this goes for most everybody.<br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>
Arjen<br>
