&lt;Hej Anders, :-)<br>
it sure would be nice to say hello to other people <br>
but they want to talk about numbers, money, and government.<br>
I wonder if you are the only person that reads me.<br>
May be Max told every one to give me the silent treatment. :-)&gt;<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Other areas take over the use of the cortex; this can be quite large</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;changes if they occur early or during periods of neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;plasticity. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;1:1- How do I induce plasticity?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Training seems to be the usual way.</i><br>
<p>
That's too general a term for me.<br>
1- How do I train for an intensification of neural plasticity?<br>
1 1- What thoughts,<br>
1 2- how hard,<br>
1 3- how long?<br>
1 4- How does blood pressure effect it?<br>
1 5- How does diet effect it?<br>
How about calcium?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;1:2- If there was hyperplasticity what would it be like,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;short term memory?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you mean a state of very high neural plasticity? In that case you</i><br>
<i>&gt;would likely learn fast but also forget fast, new memories would erase</i><br>
<i>&gt;old memories and stray thoughts would be remembered far too well. </i><br>
<p>
...sounds like short-term memory.<br>
1- What would mid-term memory be if anything?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Used</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the right way it would be perfect for self programming, </i><br>
<p>
How can the mind become more sensitive to other frequencies<br>
(ie. radio, EM biofields)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;1:3:1- How does short term memory work?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Good question. Some of it is likely activity patterns in the cell</i><br>
<i>&gt;assemblies involved in a thought or a concept that remains over time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and slowly fades. There are also some plastic processes in synapses</i><br>
<i>&gt;which may act here, but honestly we don't know yet.</i><br>
<p>
1- What do neurons that get used often for a long time have?<br>
Seems likely to me that short term memories lack that.<br>
2- Do cells detach and reattach to others?<br>
3- Is there an intermediate phase between approach and connection <br>
in which signals may be passed?<br>
4- On average, what direction do axons point?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;2:2- This basicly happens to the paralysed, what happens to them?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have heard some reports that people with certain forms of paralysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;get a state of flat affect. But I have not looked into the area much.</i><br>
<p>
Flat?<br>
So pathways become unused <br>
because all stimuli use other paths of less resistance?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;2:3- If I wore sunglasses, earplugs, and gloves 24 hours a day</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;how would my brain change after...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Change in what way? There are change on many timescales, ranging from</i><br>
<i>&gt;seconds to years. Most likely you would quickly adapt in a few hours,</i><br>
<p>
What happens during adaptation?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and then there would be a gradual deterioration as the lack of sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt;input made you more sensitive to "neural noise" and internally</i><br>
<i>&gt;generated sensations. </i><br>
<p>
Especially during meditation,<br>
I feel my pulse in my brain and hear it in my ears.<br>
I follow can the path of gas through my intestines for minutes.<br>
It's made me so aware of my repiration <br>
that I am developing a new rythym and matras to match.<br>
My spine creaks at the base of my skull.<br>
<p>
My sunglasses do not do much harm as I stare at a moniter all day.<br>
I do not wear earplugs ALL the time,<br>
"Future Fantastic", The Learning Channel, and the Discovery Channel <br>
are good to listen to.<br>
Another interesting related fact is I remember more dreams.<br>
<p>
1- What is "neural noise"?<br>
Is that why my ears squeal?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I need a funtional brain map</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;to see what tasks are next to eachother;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I've spent several hours looking but failed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We don't know where and how "Tasks" are stored, although we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasonably good maps of some functions (like the visual cortex,</i><br>
<i>&gt;primary motor system, speech etc).</i><br>
<p>
Please, <br>
some good technical terms for brain map,<br>
that's all I need. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A PET or fMRI scan shows what</i><br>
<i>&gt;areas are activated during different tasks, but gives no hint of what</i><br>
<i>&gt;they actually do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lesion studies help to find out this by disrupring</i><br>
<i>&gt;ordinary function, and sometimes electrical stimulation and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;recording can give more information. But it is a very complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;undertaking to understand even a small region.</i><br>
<p>
It would help if PETs and fMRIs were done <br>
during lucid nihil meditation (stops thought during dream).<br>
The S/N is better.<br>
