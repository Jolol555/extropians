<i>&gt; &gt;No, what I am saying is that the energy drain to refine the oil that</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;efficiency of an IC car, as a systemic calculation, while electric</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;source</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And where exactly does this "source" come from?  It is coal dug up</i><br>
<i>&gt; and transported in the same inefficient process or else oil or</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural gas which are refined and transported in the same manner as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fuel used to power an IC engine (solar and RE sources being so</i><br>
<i>&gt; small as to be completely insignificant in any such analysis.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like this back-end cost is a wash as far as efficiency</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations go, the electric power plant is more efficient than</i><br>
<i>&gt; masses of individual engines but that is as far back as you can take</i><br>
<i>&gt; the calculation.  Distribution costs for both forms are equally fuzzy</i><br>
<i>&gt; (i.e. building and maintaining an electrical distribution network is</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive and costs energy, the same distribution network for</i><br>
<i>&gt; gasoline is expensive but you had to build the roads in the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; place for the cars which are the subject of this discussion...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Because electric plants are big, they typically are built on a pipeline<br>
of whatever fuel they are using. Even coal plants are built alongside<br>
railroads, oil and gas on pipelines, hydro on rivers, wind on hilltops,<br>
etc. Because their sites are chosen ahead of time for their ease of<br>
supply of their fuel, they get a boost from inexpensive supply. They<br>
then, because they operate at constant max efficiency RPM, get<br>
efficiency gains from that, which in themselves are a HUGE savings over<br>
an IC vehicle. Gasoline or ethanol operated IC vehicles must depend on a<br>
much less efficient distribution mechanism that requires fleets of<br>
trucks, millions of miles of roads, etc. Such IC vehicles then are<br>
almost never running at their peak efficiency. Because EVs, at their<br>
power source, use less fuel than an IC vehicle does in situ, the energy<br>
costs to refine fuel per vehicle are lower.<br>
