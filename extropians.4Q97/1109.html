I just finished reading Moravec's "Mind Children".  I was intrigued by<br>
Moravec's idea of robots gradually building a"real world simulation database"<br>
to help them adapt to the real world without constantly having to reinvent the<br>
wheel every time they are confronted with a situation.  A good idea, which did<br>
not seem to occur to Moravec, would be to have each robot in the world to<br>
download its "simulation database" to a central robot database every night (or<br>
week or whatever).  At this central robot database location, the aggregate<br>
experiences of every robot in existence (and those no longer existing) would be<br>
downloaded to all robots every night while they replenished their power<br>
supplies or experienced downtime.<br>
<p>
This idea of a central robot database would exponentially increase the rate at<br>
which robots "evolved".  Where as one robot might take years to compile a<br>
database of experiences sufficient to achieve a certain level of sophistication<br>
with regards to "dealing with the real world", a million robots worldwide might<br>
achieve this objective in a single day.  An analogy would be if you had a<br>
million humans striving to achieve their doctorate in astrophysics.  As the<br>
human condition is now, each would have to spend years compiling the knowledge<br>
base necessary to deserve such a degree, but if they could share their<br>
knowledge they could achieve the objective in a much smaller amount of time.<br>
Actually, in such a situation, students could change their approach by having<br>
one group focus specifically on one aspect of astrophysics (say quantum<br>
mechanics) while others targeted other areas (say symmetries in various<br>
theories) to vastly increase the rate of knowledge accumulation by reduced<br>
levels of redundancy.<br>
