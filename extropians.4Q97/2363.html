Wayne Hayes posted a piece purporting to demonstrate<br>
that Americans pay too little for gasoline:<br>
<p>
}First is the $3.3 to $10.9 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies.<br>
}They have convinced Congress to grant them a whole list of tax<br>
}subsidies from the oil depletion allowance to accelerated depreciation<br>
}and a bunch of other breaks given to no other industry.<br>
<p>
This is valid.  Without those strange tax rules, drilling<br>
practices (and therefore prices) would be different.<br>
<p>
}... Taxes that the oil companies don't pay means that other<br>
}taxpayers---or our grandchildren in the form of debt---do pay.<br>
<p>
Ha.  How often has the government ever lowered a tax rate<br>
because it took in too much?<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the extra money collected if they oil companies<br>
were "fully" taxed would probably be used by regulators to make us<br>
poorer.<br>
<p>
}It's not just federal taxes that are being tapped to meet our<br>
}petroleum addiction, but also local property taxes. ISLR estimated<br>
}that if the transportation taxes paid it's full freight in<br>
}Minneapolis, rather than some of the burden being paid by property<br>
}taxes, gasoline would cost another 18 cents/gallon.<br>
<p>
For what, upkeep of Minneapolis streets?  I benefit from good streets<br>
if I walk or ride a bicycle.  Merchants benefit, through customer<br>
access, even if they never buy a gallon of gasoline.  Why put the<br>
entire load on gasoline?<br>
<p>
}Second, taxpayers spend $26.6 to $70.7 billion to pay for military<br>
}protection in the Middle East and elsewhere.  ...<br>
<p>
This is partly valid.  Libertarians would say, let the oil companies<br>
do their own fighting.  On another hand, the Gulf War was hardly needed<br>
to keep the oil flowing; what was Saddam going to do with the oil he<br>
grabbed, eat it?<br>
<p>
}Third, and the hardest to quantify precisely-but likely the most<br>
}expensive of all-is the estimated $25.5 to $267 billion annual costs<br>
}in the form of environmental and health costs associated with<br>
}pollution...<br>
<p>
Putting those costs in gasoline tax would externalize any benefit<br>
from designing a cleaner engine.  Technology exists to identify<br>
the gross polluters on the road; find them and tax *them*.<br>
