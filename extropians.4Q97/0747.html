 I should observe that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian. <br>
 I've spent the last seven years promoting libertarianism, <br>
 whether with pamphlets at protests, county fairs and the <br>
 like or over the Internet. <br>
<p>
 But I always practice and encourage questioning your <br>
 memes, which is in fact how I became a libertarian.<br>
 In many ways it's more important to make the case<br>
 against what you believe/believed than for it.<br>
<p>
 Now, in reply:<br>

  IAN: So if my apartment is on land that was stolen<br>
  from the Indians, I get to live rent free? If that<br>
  pesky landlord comes around here again I'll just  <br>
  get out the gun... "How dare you extract rent <br>
  from stolen land. Do you think theft is OK?" <br>
<p>
  I don't think theft is OK. My eighth great grand- <br>
  father Roger Williams vigorously opposed, as I do now,<br>
  the theft of Indian lands (<a href="http://www.symmetry.net/roger">http://www.symmetry.net/roger</a>).<br>
  But even as the Indians did trade for land among <br>
  themselves (a very significant fact rejected by <br>
  socialists that Roger observed himself after living<br>
  with Indians for several years), still much, most,<br>
  or all Indian land was at sometime stolen from <br>
  another tribe. <br>
<p>
  In short, there's no way to establish the rightful<br>
  owner. Clearly, even as Indian lands may have been <br>
  stolen,  it was the duty of European settlers to <br>
  respect what claims they came upon. Perhaps they<br>
  could have said, "If it was stolen, the claim is <br>
  void, so we get it. Get those thiefs out of here."<br>
  That would be analogous to someone saying, "Since<br>
  the U.S. robbed Indian lands, I don't have to pay<br>
  taxes." So the case that if the U.S. was stolen,<br>
  it's void is a circular argument, since it also<br>
  justifies the existence of the U.S. to the extent<br>
  that Indian property was once stolen, which the<br>
  evidence suggests most-to-all probably was<br>
  at some point after a tribal war.<br>
<p>
  So I don't see the case that the U.S. is void.<br>
  In which case the preexisting established claims<br>
  stand, with libertarian moral theory activated<br>
  now, or at most to the point rightful owners<br>
  can be established and proven.<br>
