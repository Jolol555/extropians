I appologize if my thoughts seem contradictory. Sometimes, I can confuse<br>
even myself. (-;<br>
Perhaps what I was trying to say is that there very well may be a way to<br>
have much shorter development cycles than one may expect. Anyone care to<br>
guess?  My guess would be if we could increase the growth rate, we'd<br>
probably have to slow it down as well.<br>
<p>
Speaking of cold fusion fairies, does anyone here know about free energy,<br>
over-unity field theory or any other progressive engery theories? I heard<br>
Bryan O'Leary speaking about this subject on the radio and his impression<br>
seemed to be that there were already working models of these systems in<br>
India and Japan.<br>
<p>
What say you? It seems that the best ideas i've heard about transportation<br>
involve some thoughtful combination of a free-energy system and<br>
anti-gravity. Could a vehicle which repels mass to stay afloat ever get<br>
into a head-on collision with another similar vehicle?<br>
