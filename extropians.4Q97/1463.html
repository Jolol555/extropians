I disagree....  we must deal with this problem, if we are to perform any<br>
calculations which include the concept of infinity.<br>
<p>
Suppose there are the same number of decimals in [0, 1] and [0, 2].  We<br>
should be able to subtract the number of decimals in [0, 1] from the number<br>
of decimals in [0, 2].  If all infinities are equal, then these represent<br>
the same number, and the answer should be zero.  However, they are not the<br>
same number, and instead the result is ANOTHER infinite number, the number<br>
of decimals in (1, 2].  This alone disproves the result that all infinities<br>
are equal.<br>
<p>
However, an objector might make a special case for infinity, suggesting<br>
that no addition or subtraction from infinity changes its value...  it is<br>
always infinity.  However, sometimes we CAN subtract infinite numbers from<br>
one another and get zero, such as when we subtract the number of decimals<br>
in [0, 2] from the number of decimals in [1, 3].<br>
<p>
Since the number of decimals in [0, 1] when subtracted from the number in<br>
[0, 2] gives me an infinite number, and since the number of decimals in [1,<br>
3] when so subtracted gives me 0, and since infinity is much larger than 0,<br>
we are forced to admit that the number of decimals in [0, 2] and [1, 3] are<br>
both greater than the number of decimals in [0, 1].<br>
<p>
Thus, we need some way of finding out when infinities are larger as well as<br>
how much larger they get.<br>
<p>
     -YEAH BABY I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT YOU'D WANT ME TOO-<br>
