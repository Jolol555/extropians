<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; necessary?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe young octopi could grow up with humans instead of other octopi?<br>
I have been thinking about one assumption we seem to be making in this<br>
discussion, that the uplifted species should be essentially "animal X<br>
+ intelligence + with its own culture". That is nice, but even the<br>
least invasive forms of uplifting would add a lot of human stuff to<br>
the animal, and likely result in a mixed culture. So why not accept<br>
that and try to create uplifted species intended right from the start<br>
to be integrated in "human" culture (which by the time they are smart<br>
enough will likely be barely recognizable to us mehums); the<br>
sophoctopi would not be entirely octopodian, but neither would they be<br>
purely human - they would be a mixture.<br>
