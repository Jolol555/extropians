<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually I find that the Singularity stays about 20-30 years in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the Singularity back then.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 20-30 years is enough time for significant changes in technology and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in society.  When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; could occur in that time frame.  In fact, technology has not advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; as fast as was expected back then, at least not in those areas.  AI has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been 20-30 years away since the 1950's.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good point, and I think that visions of a Singularity<br>
based on nanotech suffer from this. However...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree here. Things like x-ray lithography and copper<br>
chips recently demonstrated can easily keep the industry afloat<br>
for the next 10 years. Even after that there are candidates<br>
currently being successfully researched like: optical logic gates,<br>
quantum computers, quantum dots, and other stuff I don't know<br>
because I'm a software guy not hardware... All of these advanced<br>
pieces of technology have been demonstrated to actually work,<br>
although they are very far from being powerful enough to even<br>
replace a Pentium. But at least there are possibilities, and work<br>
being done on these in the next 10 years should provide ways to<br>
keep Moore's law going.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It's our old friend, the S curve.  Right now the growth in performance</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks exponential, just as the increase in sewing machine speeds (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtually any other industrial performance measure) looked exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt; at one time.  But they hit a limit back then, and we will probably hit</i><br>
<i>&gt; a limit ourselves now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I'm relatively new to the list, but my understanding of an "S curve"<br>
is that is for a particular technology- like aluminum+silicon<br>
chips like a Pentium. Obviously each technology reaches a limit,<br>
and something new like copper steps in. The question is can we<br>
keep finding newer and more powerful technologies, right?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; That doesn't mean that progress will stop; all the ramifications of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the information revolution will continue to develop even if computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; performance tops out a few orders of magnitude better than we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; it today.  And there are other technologies which are poised for growth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; biotech of course, and possibly materials science, microtech, etc.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; are probably going to be the hot fields of 2010.</i><br>
<p>
What is interesting is that all of those fields relate back to<br>
computing and may make more powerful computation available...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can</i><br>
<i>&gt; guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined</i><br>
<i>&gt; to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though</i><br>
<i>&gt; things often take much longer than we expect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal</i><br>
<p>
For anything related to software engineering (AI), I agree with<br>
you. Unless we can come up with ways to reduce the complexity of<br>
software development, things there will get slower and slower.<br>
Hardware on the other hand should continue to grow for at least<br>
another 20 years even with the technologies we have today. The<br>
question is: does super-hardware without AI software bring about<br>
a singularity? Or will the super-hardware make the effort of<br>
programming an AI possible?<br>
