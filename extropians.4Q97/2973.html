<i>&gt; OK, I'll bite:  How would the pursuit of standards of cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonviolence limit growth or evolution?  and, How do you support your</i><br>
<i>&gt; contention that violence is a necessary prerequisite of evolution?</i><br>
<p>
Pursuit of non-violent means would not limit anything--I only<br>
question whether unquestioning avoidance of violent means might be<br>
Violence is not a prerequisite for evolution, but /selection/ is.<br>
Differential success of mutating replicators.  Selection requires<br>
both a criterion (which ones are selected?) and a means (how are<br>
those selected given future advantage?)  I'm all for using support<br>
of non-violent cooperation as a /criterion/ for selection; those<br>
are the kinds of beings I want more of in the future.  So how do<br>
we then ensure that those beings flourish and violent ones do not?<br>
And can we be free and effective in creating new kinds of beings<br>
if we don't risk failure (i.e., creating a violent one)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please refer to my previously posted essay in answering,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it sets forth the exact opposite case:  that choices</i><br>
<i>&gt; involving violence impose limits on growth and evolution, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore act as a source of entropy.</i><br>
<p>
Your essay makes a good case that narrow-minded focus on<br>
single means leads to bad solutions.  I wholeheartedly agree.<br>
That's why I'm also unwilling to narrow-mindedly focus on /only/<br>
non-violent means.  I'm perfectly willing to admit that it is<br>
possible that all the predatory people in our society who<br>
necessitate violent restraint might have been prevented from<br>
becoming such by different societal systems, medical treatment,<br>
economics, education, or other means.  It is even possible that<br>
we may find technologies to non-violently protect ourselves<br>
from them as they are today.  But since it is most definitely<br>
the case that violent restraint of them is necessary now, I<br>
cannot rule out the possibility that it will be necessary in<br>
the future as well, or that we will have to find other ways to<br>
deal with malevolent beings.<br>
<p>
For much of my life until my late 20s, I was a LeFebvrian<br>
pacifist.  I've never thrown a punch, and I hope I don't have<br>
to.  But I am no longer willing to believe that all lives are<br>
equally valuable.  My life is worth more than Geoffrey Dahmer's<br>
life, and if I have to end the latter to protect the former, I<br>
have to do so, and take responsibility for it.  If I can<br>
prevent it from happenning in the first place, that's even<br>
better.  But sometimes we don't get that choice.<br>
