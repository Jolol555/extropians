Anders,<br>
<p>
	I enjoyed your "The Calculus of Identity" page, very<br>
interesting.  Within it you seem to consider the "self function" to be<br>
a kind of "relative" thing based on opinions or whatever of whatever<br>
the particular self thing is.  But of course such opinions can be<br>
mistaken can't they?  You said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the self-function need not be universal, it is unique for each</i><br>
<i>&gt; system (I identify myself with my actions, you might identify with</i><br>
<i>&gt; your memes and somebody might identify with their body). So if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; assume the existence of some kind of abstract "superself-function"</i><br>
<i>&gt; which for any system gives us its sense of identity</i><br>
<p>
	For a moment let's assume that there is no such thing as an<br>
immortal spiritual ghost inside our body that is ourselves.  If a<br>
person identifies himself as such a fictional "ghost" which he might<br>
sincerely believe is inside his body, then his concept of self would<br>
not exist right?  Since his false ideas had no correspondence to<br>
anything in reality.<br>
<p>
	You said you identify yourself with your actions.  This is<br>
only partially true isn't it?  Wouldn't a very different body that<br>
acted the same as you be different than you?  To get an accurate<br>
concept of self you must consider all things that make us what we are.<br>
Though a virtual copy of ourselves running on silicone, might have<br>
identical virtual actions, there are obvious differences which should<br>
not be ignored, though some of the difference may not be to important.<br>
<p>
	So, shouldn't a self() function, rather than be something that<br>
is relative to the particular system or person, be something that is<br>
more absolute and universal?  Shouldn't it consist of all true<br>
attributes of the self and none that are false or not really existent<br>
attributes?<br>
<p>
	Of course everything else would still apply, such as "Identity<br>
Horizons" beyond which one would cease to be themselves, but any place<br>
you placed such "horizons" would seem somewhat arbitrarily placed<br>
along the continuum that can be us.  What does it really matter<br>
whether I define myself to be different than I was when I was 2 or<br>
not?<br>
