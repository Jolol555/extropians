Dan, why do you think that issues of economics and politics<br>
will be irrelevant after the Singularity?<br>
<p>
Do you think that post-Singularity entities (PSEs) will not<br>
require scarce physical resources to carry out their projects?<br>
I suspect they will, and that much contemporary economic theory<br>
will be applicable to analyzing their behavior as a result.<br>
<p>
Do you think that PSEs will be incapable of forcing one another to<br>
do things non-consensually, and that they will not develop<br>
institutional means of minimizing or at least controlling this sort<br>
of circumstance?  I concede that this seems more plausible (blue<br>
goo?) than the "postscarcity" nonsense, but it doesn't seem<br>
very likely to me.  <br>
<p>
Eliezer's position that right and wrong objectively exist, and that<br>
we do not currently have adequate cognitive access to them, seems<br>
like a very reasonable position to me.  Where he loses me is<br>
that part where he seems to assume that some future entity is<br>
more likely to have adequate cognitive access to objective<br>
right and wrong than we do.  <br>
<p>
(This is where Tipler's baroque fantasies of the Omega point lose<br>
me too.  The Omega point looks to me like nothing more or less than<br>
the marriage of Heaven and Hell.  Tipler goes on and on about the<br>
Heaven part, and never mentions the Hell.)<br>
