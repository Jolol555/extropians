At 09:18 AM 11/21/97 I wrote that Mark Turner's<br>
Literary Mind theory suggested to me that human<br>
thought is based principally on pattern matching, an<br>
on-going variation and selection, feedback between<br>
many levels, where it is effectively impossible to<br>
untangle all the causal threads.<br>

neptune@mars.superlink.net responded:<br>
&lt; The statement here implies that there are causal<br>
threads -- i.e., that causality is operative!:) &gt;<br>
<p>
I meant that we usually have imputed causality to<br>
'things' where the physical causes are probably<br>
several levels removed: Did I throw the ball, or did<br>
my arm throw it, or did the game I'm playing cause me<br>
to throw it?<br>
<p>
Perhaps the point these people I quoted were trying<br>
to make is that, while there is always some<br>
object-level causality going on, that may not be the<br>
most effective way to describe or study a situation.<br>
<p>
Regarding the Walter J. Freeman quote that we<br>
humanize the relationships among things by assigning<br>
a cause, and "we do this through neural processes of<br>
corollary discharge and reafference", Twink responds:<br>
<p>
&lt; I disagree, and note how he has assigned a cause<br>
here!  He implies "neural processes" are the cause of<br>
the way we "humanize" the "interrelations of objects<br>
and events.":)  As usual, those who deny axioms must<br>
use the very axioms in the denial. &gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps he has just been a good eliminative<br>
materialist and pared things down to the 'real'<br>
underlying cause ;-)  But, as in my ball-game<br>
example, there's some circular causality involved in<br>
most complex situations.<br>
<p>
As you point out in your example of the cause of<br>
death of a woman who has been shot, the material<br>
cause of death was the bullet, the efficient cause<br>
was the pulling of the trigger, the formal cause was<br>
the killer deciding to shoot her, and the final cause<br>
... ?  Perhaps the one who was shot had threatened<br>
the one who shot her.<br>
<p>
Of course, relativism can be taken too far and<br>
interpretations can become trapped in a hermeneutical<br>
circle - then the 'causes' are in the stories we tell<br>
ourselves about what we think we perceive.  In the<br>
case of the woman's death, unless it was strictly<br>
self defense on the killer's part, I have no problem<br>
with convicting her of murder, or at least<br>
manslaughter.  But, this is a case of human actions<br>
with rather final results for one of the participants.<br>
<p>
We don't really know the final causes in most<br>
situations; but, in most situations, one or the other<br>
causes will usually suffice to get us by.  However,<br>
if we are trying to get a better understanding of the<br>
"universe that is a totality - an integrated whole"<br>
(as you put it), a relational viewpoint may often<br>
offer a more complete picture than a causal viewpoint<br>
that is practically restricted to a limited set of<br>
objects and their apparent direct impacts on each<br>
other.<br>
