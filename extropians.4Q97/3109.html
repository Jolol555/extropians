Incredibly, Abraham Moses Genen wrote this bullshit on the list:<br>
<p>
"There is a problem here that far to many people fail to understand. Ethically,<br>
we must consider the concerns and fates of our fellows if we are to reduce if<br>
not eliminate social inequities. The issue as I see it is to transcend our<br>
selfishness for the common good.<br>
<p>
"Can we focus on greater involvement by increasing direct participation in<br>
government and eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome that our so-called<br>
representative government is degenerating into?"<br>
<p>
Is this guy for fucking real?<br>
<p>
Are you sure there are --?<br>
<p>
You know what? What does it take to get a mailing list started? is it demanding<br>
on your hardware? What software is required? We need a fucking dedicated and<br>
moderated extropian and libertarian list to get rid of this bullshit! I don't<br>
find this crap funny at all!<br>
<p>
Oh, let me guess: "You need Unix to run a mailing list; can't do it on<br>
Windows..."<br>
