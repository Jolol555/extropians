Damien, et al: I find it oddly coincidental that I keep seeing SAIC pop<br>
up in the oddest places. Trying to find out the entire breadth of their<br>
business is impossible due to the amount of classified work they do for<br>
our and other governments.<br>
<p>
Do you all know that SAIC owns INTERNIC????<br>
<p>
They are also one of the main contractors for the Air Force Test<br>
Facility known popularly as Area 51 (along with AG&amp;G, a multinational<br>
they have a cozy relationship with).<br>
<p>
They do quite a bit of subcontract work for Lockheed, as well as with<br>
the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, main contractor for the new<br>
classified facilities at Micheal Field in Utah and the WHite Sands Utah<br>
Launch Facility (which is supposedly the launch facility for the<br>
classified launcher/spyplane the Air Force has which uses the linear<br>
aerospike technology now being used on the Lockheed Venturestar program.<br>
<p>
These are just some of the "tip of the iceberg" projects I find SAIC<br>
involved in. I recommend that everyone keep an eye out for SAIC projects<br>
or other SAIC association when the spot them.<br>
<p>
I find it rather uncharacteristic that SAIC would be involved in such a<br>
program as remote viewing unless it really had something going for it.<br>
