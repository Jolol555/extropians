In a message dated 97-10-10 14:35:40 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 How about we create an FAQ that's sent when you first subscribe that briefly<br>
 answers those 'basic' questions we all find so annoying.  Split the FAQ into<br>
 sections that also tell you the correct classifier for each topic, followed<br>
 by a short description and then a list command that allows you to request a<br>
 more comprehesive FAQ on that topic.  We could do the same for various<br>
papers<br>
 (extropian principles, dynamic optimism, etc.)  That way anyone who reads it<br>
 will know that the information is there, and if they still post basic<br>
 questions, we can just point them in the direction of the correct FAQ.  We<br>
 can let list members decide on what to put in these FAQs (when a basic<br>
 consensus is reach on that subject and we want to move on) and also what<br>
 classifiers to use.  Not only will this help both new and current members,<br>
 but we'll be building a comprehensive database of ideas in the process.<br>
 <br>

<p>
Not saying I disagree...but consider...<br>
<p>
I subscribe to several lists...Extropians, Transhuman, Libfut..and several<br>
others...Extropians is BY FAR the most prolific...there are always new<br>
messages...some of the others are dark for days...weeks...at a time...is<br>
cutting down on message volume really such a desirable goal?<br>
