                    <br>
<p>
But then the two are no longer perfect copies of each other because they were <br>
told different things. Some, like me, think the distinction between a copy <br>
and an original is meaningless, so we wouldn't change much, so the received <br>
information is irrelevant to the thought experiment, so my original objection<br>
holds.<br>
  <br>
For some reason others think there is a huge, if inexpressible, difference  <br>
between a copy and an original, so if I told one of them that they were a <br>
copy and could somehow get them to believe it (it would not be easy) then <br>
they would become very upset. The copy would be undergoing a traumatic <br>
emotional experience but the original would not, so the state of mind the two <br>
would be in would not be even approximately the same, so my original <br>
objection holds.<br>
<p>
I think it tells you something that the substance of this thought experiment  <br>
is symmetrical, it in no way changes if you lie and tell the original he's  <br>
the copy and the copy he's the original. Convincing the copy he's the <br>
original would as easy as convincing the original he's the original; and <br>
convincing the original he's the copy would be no more difficult than<br>
convincing the copy he's the copy.                    <br>
