I absolutely agree with most of what you say. In particular, I agree I<br>
could be wrong. I would search my mind for the last time I've seen a<br>
post where you admitted the same regarding yourself, but I seem to have<br>
promised unilateral non-aggression. Bother.<br>
<p>
I stand by my belief that hydrocarbon reformation at point of use<br>
(including *inside* the fuel cell) is the only practical "hydrogen" use<br>
for the foreseeable future* for most personal-use vehicles. See below:<br>
such use does not contradict the notion that cars may have fuel cells in<br>
them. *(Of course governments impose all sorts of impractical things on<br>
people; and the foreseeable future is only about five years).<br>
<p>
Re: pollution: Yes, and sort of, and no. Depends on what you mean by<br>
pollution. Less airborne nitrox compounds, sure. But the carbon and<br>
trace elements in the fuel have to go somewhere. And catalyst bed<br>
contamination remains a serious problem. Further, as I mentioned before,<br>
many "hydrogen economy" plans just move the pollution around, while<br>
_increasing_ the sum. Examples: farmed-methanol, central-site<br>
electrolysis with hydride storage, etc.<br>
<p>
Now, hypothetical complex-organic fuel cell catalysts (verging on<br>
enzymes in complexity) *might* solve these  problems. I devoutly wish<br>
for them. But evidence of their actual commercial-quantity appearance<br>
remains sketchy at the present time--even though I built a<br>
bacteria-powered fuel cell twenty years ago. IMHO, bulk nano is the most<br>
likely way to produce such--by which time _everything else changes too_.<br>
<p>
AFAIK, all published fuel cell chemistries that use hydrocarbons<br>
function in exactly the way I describe, by reforming the fuel at point<br>
of use: the fuel cell. Methanol is expensive for reasons mentioned<br>
previously. The issue isn't purely one of how efficent the _fuel cell_<br>
is; it's a _systems_ concern.<br>
And I am extremely interested in the carbon-fiber/carbon-tubule H2<br>
storage systems. Nonetheless, I still think gas stations will pump gas<br>
(or something very like it) for a while. The energy desnity (per gram<br>
_or_ per cc) of 87-octane regular gasoline is hard to beat.<br>
<p>
It is perfectly possible that that fuel will run a fuel cell. I never<br>
said otherwise.<br>
<p>
As for the international impact of any (even a *tiny*) shift in energy<br>
use by the USA, G7, Pac Tigers, etc... well, that's a straw man if I<br>
ever heard one. Clearly people are prepared to fight over this stuff.<br>
People are prepared to fight over lots of things.<br>

I absolutely agree; _and_ they have a huge capital cost and Weltpolitik<br>
impact as long as the primary catalyst is platinum. {Platimum trades at<br>
around $380 an ounce. The US is not a big world supplier. Connect the<br>
dots.)<br>
