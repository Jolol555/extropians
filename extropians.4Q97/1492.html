Does anybody know some good references regarding coherent quantum <br>
systems in neurons?<br>
<p>
I would like to read more about it before I make a definitive <br>
conclusion.<br>
<p>
As far as I know there is no hard proof for the existence of such <br>
coherent quantum systems in neurons. OK, till they have been proven <br>
not to exist, they could be possible. But this is no reason to <br>
assume they do exist. This is hardly a reasoning in accordance with <br>
Occams Razor.<br>
<p>
(( This is the same reasoning as people who "believe" in a GOD. <br>
They reason that because a GOD (outside our universe) cannot be <br>
proven impossible, a GOD does exist. ))<br>
<p>
<p>
The real question is : <br>
<p>
Are the known characteristics of neural networks <br>
sufficient to account for the behavior of all biological <br>
neural networks. <br>
(Without any need for more complex computation systems <br>
like coherent quantum systems.)<br>
<p>
<p>
I think it seems very plausible that coherent quantum systems <br>
are not actively involved in the thinking processes of our brain. <br>
<p>
Some questions :<br>
<p>
1) Can somebody explain how these quantum systems stay coherent long <br>
enough to perform a useful computation?<br>
<p>
(As far as I know the current proposals for artificial quantum computers <br>
are to be working at very low temperatures to keep the system coherent <br>
long enough. )<br>
<p>
2) How are these quantum systems supposed to interact with the <br>
conventional information processes in the neuron?<br>
<p>
I still think the assumptions about the presence of quantum <br>
systems in neurons are only wild speculation...<br>
