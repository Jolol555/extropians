I'm surprised nobody has pointed out:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1)  "Make me think a million times as fast."</i><br>
<p>
In the hands of a malicious genii, or even an objective one, this could<br>
easily lead to a hellish situation.  Your brain, thinking a million times<br>
faster, is trapped in a body able to move only at normal speeds.  It will<br>
take twelve subjective days for one second of normal time to go by,<br>
during which your sensory inputs are limited to whatever you happened to<br>
be looking at at the time.  This will effectively produce sensory<br>
deprivation, without regard to what months of paralysis will do to your<br>
psyche.  You'd probably be unable to talk or move with any coordination.<br>
Your first act will be to fall over, if you were standing.  Luckily you<br>
will have weeks to get ready before you hit the floor.<br>
<p>
All in all, not a very smart wish as worded...  And you know how those<br>
geniis are...<br>
