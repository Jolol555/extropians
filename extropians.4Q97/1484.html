<i>&gt; Insane, because they think it might akin to putting a human in a non-</i><br>
<i>&gt; human body.  Imagine putting your mind in the body of a weasel.  Sure,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it might be nice for a romp in the park, has potential if you want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; solve your rodent problem in an exciting way, but the limitations!</i><br>
<p>
A very strange position, since uplifting very likely would involve<br>
overcoming the physical limitations too (e.g. Brin's ideas for bionic<br>
manipulators for dolphins) and the fact that the uplifted creature<br>
would likely regard its body as perfectly natural.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Next, uplifted dogs, to stick with my example, would also be good for</i><br>
<i>&gt; lots of things that might be done by humans but that a dog's abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; are better at (e.g., guarding property), but which current robots are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not yet up to.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your<br>
intelligent guard dogs would want pay and maybe form unions<br>
(packs?). I think unintelligent animals might do plenty of jobs better<br>
in many ways than intelligent animals; you other two arguments are<br>
IMHO more compelling reasons for uplifting than getting certain forms<br>
of labor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Third, the gains for the culture/memescape might be great.  We get</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bonus of an added perspective.  This is almost like using genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; algorithmns to design bridges as opposed to human engineering. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; dog perspective on the world will help up to expand the limits of ours.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a very good point. <br>
<p>
Then there is the technical aspect of uplifting: how do we do it? I<br>
have been thinking about the cruicial role of language in<br>
bootstrapping intelligence; maybe the addition of a more advanced<br>
language system to an uplift species would be a good start? <br>
