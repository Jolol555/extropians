&lt;excerpt&gt;On the other hand, molecular assemblers certainly do exist. We<br>
call them catalysts. Robert Weymouth, Mark Davis, and Gabor Somorjai were<br>
invited to the conference to remind us of just how powerful modern<br>
catalysts can be. These are not examples of the universal assemblers in<br>
the Drexlerian dream. Instead, they are entirely ad hoc assemblers that<br>
in their intimate, hyperdimensional, chemical way go about the business<br>
of molecular assembly of just a particular product from just a particular<br>
set of reactants. But in this specific, assigned task they are very<br>
effective molecular assembly machines.<br>

&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>

While a given protein makes only "a particular product from just a<br>
particular set of reactants," DNA has much fewer such limitations. <br>
Indeed, DNA is at the root of everything which we call "alive," including<br>
cheeseburgers.  If it happens in a cow, there's no law that says that we<br>
can't, for example, rewrite the DNA of a bacteria and make it happen in a<br>
test tube.<br>
<p>
<p>
We can already rewrite DNA...  we even know how it codes for proteins;<br>
but those catalysts are nothing if not complicated.  Writing our own is<br>
hard, but possible,* if economically unfeasible (though this will<br>
change).<br>
<p>
<p>
This is just one of the possible ways by which MNT could happen; it may<br>
not be the best way.  However, if it can happen *in any way at all*, then<br>
I, along with many other future-minded scientists, will strive to make it<br>
happen.<br>
