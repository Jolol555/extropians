<i>&gt;Abraham Moses Genen (futurist@frontiernet.net)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dear Fellow Extropians:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Having read Mr. Goddard's speculations, conjectures ( and possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt;paranoid delusions)repeatedly, may I respectfully suggest that he</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider reading Aristotle on scientific method followed by </i><br>
<i>&gt;Blackstone on the rules of evidence.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: (1) There is proof that the military <br>
  lied about their activities on July 17,'96. <br>
  (2) There is proof the govt continues to lie<br>
  about such. (3) There is proof that the FBI <br>
  has acted to cover up facts. (4) There is <br>
  photographic evidence of a military drone-<br>
  type aerial device a few miles and moments <br>
  from the crash. (5) There are over 100 wit-<br>
  nesses of a missile-like streak rising from <br>
  the ocean to impact TWA 800. (6) There is<br>
  massive penetration deformation to the <br>
  exterior fuselage panels exceeding the <br>
  psi strength of a CFT explosion.<br>
<p>
  Proof of deception, physical evidence of <br>
  external-projectile penetration, photo-<br>
  graphic evidence of military activity, <br>
  over 100 harmonious eyewitness accounts <br>
  of projectile penetration... sorry to<br>
  foil your ad hominem, but that's not <br>
  a "paranoid delusion." <br>
<p>
  Now you may be more impressed by claims<br>
  of government officials that "We didn't<br>
  do it," than you are with proofs and <br>
  overwhelming evidence, but I am not.<br>
<p>
  The propensity for so many to be duped <br>
  by incredulous government claims... for <br>
  so many to fail to question the dictates <br>
  of authorities and define all that does <br>
  as "paranoid" is a sorry sight. Such is <br>
  what it takes to loose all freedoms.<br>
<p>
