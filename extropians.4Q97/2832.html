Last year a close friend of mine also died of cancer, after some test and<br>
surgery he was diagnosed as 'terminal' which basically meant he still could<br>
live 6 - 18 months but that he was beyond curing. In spite of his declining<br>
abilities he spent a few of those months doing some of the stuff he never<br>
had gotten around to and after half a year (when he was really in pain) he<br>
decided enough was enhough.<br>
<p>
Because he didn't have much family a bunch of friends (including myself)<br>
spent a long day with him, talking, laughing, crying. In the evening a<br>
doctor came and, after a final series of questions, injected him with a<br>
morphine overdose. We all sat around his bed while he slowly dozed off. He<br>
died without much pain, in the presence of the people he cared about most.<br>
In a terrible situation this was the best (IMHO) of all possible choices.<br>
<p>
When death was pronounced the doctor then called the Justice Ministery to<br>
report what had taken place. By standard procedure he was be interviewed by<br>
the DA and the case reported as a 'legal' instance of euthanasia.<br>
<p>
I'm really sorry a 'solution' (for lack of a better word in my vocab) like<br>
this isn't possible in the States. There's a lot of pain in your post Ev, I<br>
wish I could offer something besides my warmest sympathies (please convey<br>
those also to your friend and his family if you think this'll help any).<br>
<p>
My mother (54) is suffering from Parkinsons disease and after her surgery a<br>
few months ago, which seemed to help a lot, things have now taken a turn<br>
for the worse. Another operation to her brain is hardly possible because it<br>
could result in loss of vision and speech or worse. She's been fighting<br>
this thing for 13 years now and seems really tired sometimes. It scares me<br>
to think what will happen next year if there is no improvement. The only<br>
small comfort is that she wil be able to make her own choice as long as she<br>
is concious.<br>
<p>
Warm regards,<br>
