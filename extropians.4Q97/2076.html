I think that's a much better idea than effectively kicking non-members off<br>
the existing list.  Generally people react quite negatively to having <br>
something taken away (much more so than to an a equivalent gain).<br>
Saying non-members can't post certainly seems to be really bothering a lot <br>
of people here.<br>
