	ARBOREAL COMMUNISM ?   N O T <br>
<p>
<p>
	(c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
	SCIENCE NEWS [1] recently reported a study <br>
	purported to have found an example in nature <br>
	of organisms practicing the communist ethic <br>
	"from each according to ability, to each <br>
	according to need." This alleged communist<br>
	conspiracy includes the Paper birch [2], <br>
	the Douglas fir [3], and several fungi [4].<br>
<p>
	SN proclaims that this study "challenges <br>
	the current ecosystem models, which assume <br>
	that plants constantly compete with one <br>
	another for resources." That extrapolation <br>
	is, however, not supported by the evidence.<br>
<p>
<p>
	WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS<br>
<p>
	The study found that carbon dioxide (CO2) <br>
	in the form of sugar is distributed from <br>
	the roots of trees in the sun with the most <br>
	CO2 to the roots of trees in the shade with <br>
	the least CO2. This egalitarian transfer is <br>
	performed by a network of subterranean fungi. <br>
	The result is a more equitable distribution <br>
	of CO2 than would otherwise exist in the <br>
	arboreal community. As SN states:<br>
<p>
	   The [research] team showed that <br>
	   some trees give their neighbors<br>
	   carbon that they have captured<br>
	   from the atmosphere. An under-<br>
	   ground network of fungi collabo-<br>
	   rates in transporting the goods.<br>
	   ... The network envelops the <br>
	   roots of both types of trees.<br>
<p>
	   The scientists discovered that <br>
	   shade [ or need ] enhances a <br>
	   tree's ability to receive [CO2].<br>
<p>
	Irrespective of this fungi-facilitated sub-<br>
	sidy, the trees have a symbiotic relation <br>
	(mutualistic symbioses) with the fungi in <br>
	which the trees give the fungi CO2 in ex-<br>
	change for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), <br>
	which the fungi liberate from the soil.[5] <br>
	It is after this tree-fungus exchange that <br>
	the fungi will then transfer some of their <br>
	earned CO2 to trees in need of CO2. <br>
<p>
	This process of redistribution subsidizes <br>
	CO2-starved trees that are shaded under the <br>
	canopy of larger trees that take up all the <br>
	direct sun. The researchers found, however, <br>
	that as a rule, birch trees tend to experi-<br>
	ence a net loss while firs enjoy a profit. <br>
<p>
<p>
	WHO SUBSIDIZES WHO?<br>
<p>
	With the SN report entitled "Communism In <br>
	Trees Goes Underground," the presentation <br>
	of the study by SN promotes confusion by<br>
	suggesting that this egalitarian distribu-<br>
	tion can be attributed to the trees them-<br>
	selves, when in fact it can only be attrib-<br>
	uted to actions of the "middle men fungi." <br>
	Statements like these cause this confusion:<br>
<p>
	   Although plants don't plot to <br>
	   overthrow capitalist regimes, <br>
	   their actions demonstrate a <br>
	   clear communist bent. ...<br>
 <br>
	   ... trees give their neighbors <br>
	   carbon... Birches subsidized firs...<br>
<p>
	Let's think for a moment: if you gave the <br>
	baker $5 for bread and then the baker gave <br>
	$2 to the poor,  it would be erroneous to <br>
	say that you subsidized the poor. Yet that's <br>
	just what SN is saying by suggesting that <br>
	because Tree 1 (T1) gave fungus (F) CO2 in <br>
	exchange for N and P, and then F gave Tree <br>
	2 (T2) some of that CO2, therefore T1 has <br>
	subsidized T2 -- a false conclusion.<br>
	<br>
	          exchange      subsidy<br>
<i>	             |             |</i><br>
	  (TREE 1) &lt;---&gt; (FUNGUS) ---&gt; (TREE 2)<br>
<p>
	T1 gave x to F in exchange for y, therefore <br>
	T1 subsidized neither F nor T2. F, not T1,<br>
	subsidizes T2. Because T1 does not subsidize <br>
	T2, the extrapolation presented by SN that <br>
	this study "challenges the current ecosystem <br>
	models, which assume that plants constantly <br>
	compete with one another for resources" is <br>
	simply NOT supported by the evidence. <br>
<p>
	(It should be noted that while fungi are <br>
	members of the kingdom Fungi, which is a <br>
	division of the kingdom Plantae, fungi are <br>
	not plants; so to claim that the plants <br>
	in the study subsidize each other is false.<br>
	Mutualistic symbioses -- not an example of <br>
	the communist ethic -- between plants and<br>
	fungi is already well-established. [5])<br>
<p>
	The fact is that the evidence presented in <br>
	the study indicates only self-interest on <br>
	the part of all the organisms in the study.<br>
<p>
<p>
	NAKED SELF-INTEREST RULES<br>
<p>
	The only possible instance of a subsidy <br>
	and thus of "communism" to be found in the <br>
	study is the "gift" of CO2 by the fungi to <br>
	trees in need of CO2. In this way it could <br>
	be said that the fungi act like Robin Hood <br>
	-- taking from the rich to give to the poor. <br>
	But what's in it for the fungi?<br>
<p>
	The answer seems obvious to me: I suspect <br>
	that the fungi feed weaker trees that grow <br>
	in the shade beneath larger sun-drenched <br>
	trees because this subsidy ensures that <br>
	trees will shade the ground more constantly <br>
	than they would without the subsidy, thereby <br>
	maintaining the dark, damp, and cool condi-<br>
	tions that the fungi need to survive.<br>
<p>
	If, due to lack of CO2, smaller trees did<br>
	not exist under the dark canopy of large <br>
	trees, then when those large trees died -- <br>
	particularly if many died suddenly -- the <br>
	ground would be exposed to more sunlight <br>
	than if a new crop of smaller replacement <br>
	trees were always waiting under the canopy <br>
	to quickly fill the vacated space. Maintain-<br>
	ing such an  "assembly line" of trees en-<br>
	sures the constant shade the fungi need. <br>
<p>
	Maintaining a constant rotation of trees also <br>
	ensures a continuous supply of falling dead <br>
	trees, which the fungi consume. Which is what<br>
	one of the researchers suggested, hypothesiz-<br>
	ing that by feeding the weak, the fungus may<br>
	be "planning for its next meal." [1]<br>
<p>
	Through exchange with Tree 1 (T1), Fungus (F) <br>
	subsidizes Tree 2 (T2). When T1 dies, T2 is <br>
	ready to take the place of T1. F then subsid-<br>
	izes T3 via exchange with T2 in preparation <br>
	for the death of T2, and so forth... sustain-<br>
	ing a continuous life-support system for F:<br>
<p>
	  (TREE 1) &lt;---&gt; (FUNGUS) ----&gt; (TREE 2)<br>
	 (T1 dies) ----&gt; (FUNGUS) &lt;---&gt; (TREE 2)<br>
	  (TREE 3) &lt;---- (FUNGUS) &lt;---&gt; (TREE 2)<br>
	  (TREE 3) &lt;---&gt; (FUNGUS) &lt;---- (T2 dies)<br>
	  (TREE 3) &lt;---&gt; (FUNGUS) ----&gt; (TREE 4). . .<br>
<p>
	(The fungi may feed firs more than birches <br>
	because firs provide not only more darkness, <br>
	but, being evergreens, provide it more con-<br>
	stantly. The fungi might support a species, <br>
	such as the birch, that provides less of <br>
	what it needs simply because if the fungi <br>
	supported only one species of tree and a <br>
	disease wiped out all of that tree, the <br>
	fungi would have no trees and no shade.)<br>
<p>
	It stands to reason, based upon the evidence, <br>
	that the system of egalitarian CO2 distribu-<br>
	tion maintained by the fungi exists only to <br>
	sustain a continuos life-support system for<br>
	the fungi.  There is no reason to believe <br>
	that the fungus or any organism in the study <br>
	acts out of selfless "communist" altruism.<br>
<p>
<p>
	IN CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
	Rather than fulfilling the romantic role <br>
	of a Robin Hood, the evidence suggests that <br>
	the fungi act like a farmer who maintains <br>
	an egalitarian distribution of resources <br>
	to his crops, such that if one field grows <br>
	more slowly, he gives it more water and <br>
	fertilizer from the common supply than he <br>
	gives to crops growing more quickly. In <br>
	this most likely scenario, the "gift" that <br>
	the fungi give to the weaker trees is no-<br>
	thing but an act of naked self-interest,<br>
	not altruism, on the part of the fungi.<br>
<p>
	While the fungi do take from the rich and <br>
	give to the poor -- most likely out of self-<br>
	interest -- the study uncovers no evidence <br>
	of selfless subsidy, no evidence of altruism, <br>
	and therefore no evidence of arboreal com-<br>
	munism. Furthermore, the SN extrapolation <br>
	that the study "challenges the current eco-<br>
	system models,  which assume that plants <br>
	constantly compete with one another for <br>
	resources," is not supported by the evi-<br>
	dence in the study. Apart from my disagree-<br>
	ment with the SN extrapolations, I still <br>
	think SN is an excellent publication.<br>
