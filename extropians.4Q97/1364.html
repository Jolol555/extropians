A very interesting point was recently made to me by a friend who's doing<br>
a Ph.D.  in Artificial Intelligence.  Recall the first formal example of<br>
deduction that our species is alleged to have made: Socrates saying,<br>
"All men are mortal.  Socrates is a man.  Therefore Socrates is mortal."<br>
Putting it more visually,<br>
<p>
    All men are mortal        (A)<br>
    Socrates is a man         (B)<br>
    ------------------<br>
    Socrates is mortal        (C)<br>
<p>
If we are given A and B, the process of concluding C is called<br>
"deduction".  There's another form of logic we are taught, called<br>
induction.  (Not mathematical induction; *logical* induction.)  In that<br>
case, we are given many examples of B and C, and we hypothesize that A<br>
must be true.  In other words, given many specific examples, we induce<br>
a "universal law", in this case, we hypothesize that since Socrates is<br>
mortal, Plato is mortal, both their parents were mortal, and in fact<br>
nobody is ever observed to live forever, we hypothesize that *all* men<br>
are mortal.  That is logical induction: synthesizing a universal rule<br>
based on many similar observations.  It is interesting to note that<br>
logical induction is what revolutionary scientists do when they create<br>
a new theory.  They *create* what they hope are universal laws, that<br>
are designed specifically to reproduce observations.<br>
<p>
However, there is a third form of logic that apparently was never given<br>
a name until recently.  What if we are given A and C?  Namely, "All men<br>
are mortal.  Socrates is mortal."  In this case, we are given a universal<br>
law, and a conclusion, and we are left to hypothesize a possible<br>
explanation that can produce the observations, given the "universal<br>
laws".  Can we conclude that Socrates is a man?  NO!  This is because<br>
there are other universal laws.  Not only are all men mortal, but,<br>
for example all horses are mortal:<br>
<p>
    All horses are mortal.       (A')<br>
    Socrates is a horse.         (B')<br>
    ----------------------<br>
    Socrates is mortal.          (C) (not C', just C)<br>
<p>
Just because all men are mortal, and Socrates is mortal, does not imply<br>
that Socrates is a man.  Socrates may be a horse!  The process of taking<br>
a set of universal laws like A, A', etc, and a single observation like C,<br>
and creating a hyothesis like B or B' has been dubbed "abduction", with<br>
the root "abduce", by the AI people.  And the AI folks note that<br>
almost ALL logic perfomed in the everyday living of humans is<br>
abduction!  We have in our minds a picture of how the world works; we<br>
see observations, and then we *abduce* a sequence of circumstances,<br>
based on our model of the world, that could produce the observations.<br>
The abduced sequence of events is rarely a unique solution, and we<br>
spend our time finding the *best* sequence of events that fits the<br>
observations.<br>
<p>
For example, you walk outside, and the ground is wet.  What can you<br>
conclude?  Well, it may have rained recently.  Or perhaps water main<br>
broke and flooded the area.  Or a street sweeping machine went haywire<br>
and sprayed too much water.  There are several possible explanations<br>
you could abduce.  To find out which one is correct, you may have to<br>
look around some more, and use your knowledge of how the world works<br>
to create a "story" that fits the facts, and your knowledge of the<br>
world.  It is interesting to note that this is the kind of logic that<br>
Sherlock Holmes used; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle incorrectly labeled it<br>
"deduction" in his stories.<br>
<p>
I'll give one more example of abduction.  Last winter I was cross-<br>
country skiing north or Toronto.  One of the ski trails had foot<br>
prints in the middle of it.  Now, it is extremely bad ettiquette<br>
to walk on a ski trails, because it ruins the smoothness of the trail<br>
and makes it hard to ski properly, and I was seriously annoyed that<br>
somebody would be walking on the ski trails.  "What kind of asshole<br>
would go for a walk on the trails in February?", I fumed.  I had<br>
hypothesized that some inconsiderate or clueless wag was going for<br>
a pleasant walk on the trails, probably without realizing his<br>
faus pas.  About 10 minutes later the footprints ended, and at that<br>
place there was a person-shaped dent in the snow, many ski-prints and<br>
footprints facing various directions, and a little ways away was half<br>
a broken ski.  "Ahhhhhhhhh!", I thought.  Obviously, my previous<br>
abduction was incorrect.  The footprints were from a skier who<br>
had fallen down and broken a ski, and had to walk back.<br>
<p>
I have found it very interesting to observe myself in my day-to-day<br>
life and notice how often we use abduction without even realizing<br>
it, and without even having a name for it until recently.  So, one<br>
of the current challenges in AI is to build machines that can abduce<br>
as well as we do.<br>
