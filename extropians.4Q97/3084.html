<p>
I have not yet read the issue, but it sounds like Postrel has a point.<br>
Much of the opposition to progress and advancement comes from those who<br>
fear change.  The Rifkins and other neo-Luddites seem to oppose every new<br>
technology that comes along.  It is important to counter the view that<br>
change is something to be feared.<br>
<p>
Of course you are right that not all change is good.  Once we get past<br>
the view that change in itself is threatening, we can then stand on<br>
common ground to evaluate various possible options.  Each of us will make<br>
their own decisions about which changes and new technologies to embrace.<br>
Some may seem initially beneficial, like new designer drugs, or full-sense<br>
virtual sex, but in the end may prove to be harmful.<br>
<p>
I wrote earlier today about knee-jerk libertarianism.  Let us agree that<br>
people are free to exploit whatever technologies they like in order to<br>
improve their lives.  When we speak of "talking about" changes and<br>
"engineering their flow" it is in the context of mutually voluntary<br>
interactions, of persuasion and reason, not force and coercion.  This<br>
provides an unthreatening context to discuss the opportunities and<br>
dangers which change presents.<br>
<p>
I would support a form of "dynamism" which recognizes that change is<br>
inevitable, and that change is not to be opposed per se.  But at the same<br>
time, within the dynamic context we still want to think carefully and<br>
critically about the new possibilities available to us, their implications<br>
and effects.<br>
