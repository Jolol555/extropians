I think it is necessary to have redundant information for clock syncing and<br>
error recovery.  But, if the things we believe about cryptography are<br>
true--that there are "hard problems", for instance--then the overhead can<br>
be small and the result can still be impossible to distinguish from noise--<br>
even though there is redundancy, it's a hard problem to see it.<br>
<p>
There is that funny comment in A Fire Upon The Deep where (as we the<br>
readers are being treated to a boring slow-motion chase across the<br>
galaxy) two characters pass the time by debating the feasibility of public<br>
key cryptography (or any scheme except one-time pads generated with true<br>
randomness)...<br>
<p>
Quantum stuff throws wildcards into predictions about computability &amp;<br>
also provides quantum crypto possibilities, so things could look different,<br>
even pretty soon.<br>
<p>
But as far as I know you can make redundant information look like noise.<br>
<p>
(later) Oh, PHIL started this thread!?<br>
<p>
Also, like Phil says, you can make your signal have any spectrum you want<br>
and probably be sloppy about things that people with only terahertz<br>
technology can't detect--if they're who you're trying to hide from.<br>
<p>
*The Diamond Age* had those nanites with light-wavelength communication<br>
that appeared as colored sparkles.  You don't have to actually wiggle the<br>
nuclei to control photons.  Light waves are pretty long in nanometers--<br>
~600-1200nm?<br>
<p>
I guess interstellar stealth will be<br>
mainly developed to hide from *local* enemies--people from your own<br>
planet with technology similar to or somewhat better than yours.<br>
You could extend "Good fences make good neighbors" to "Interstellar<br>
civilizations only spread as far &amp; fast as their crypto technology<br>
makes safe from internal corruption."  (Which is verbose but you<br>
could probably pack it into &lt;1024 bits.)<br>
<p>
I hereby signify my recognition that this is science fiction based on<br>
science fiction.<br>
