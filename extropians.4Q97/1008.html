<i>&gt; Anders, starts with the intro, the big bang, earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; Max, starts with Civilization, and Now, and Future</i><br>
<p>
  As Popper argues, all physics is cosmology.  As is all religion.<br>
<p>
<p>
  The 'Big Bang' stuff is unscientific, untestable, and arguably <br>
  physically impossible.  A 'poisoned well.'<br>
<p>
  It owes its fell origin to the disastrous philosphical memes which <br>
  invaded the scientific community at the turn of the century.<br>
<p>
  Logical positivism said: "You cannot disuss a universe you cannot <br>
  observe.  Thus, the univere is _defined_ as that which you can see -- <br>
  i.e. a titchy one, around 5 000 light-years across."<br>
<p>
  The question then arose:<br>
<p>
  "Why does this titchy (logical-positivist) universe not self-gravitate <br>
  and collapse"?<br>
<p>
  Some 'possibles':<br>
<p>
  * It's still expanding (and that entails a point origin or 'bang');<br>
<p>
  * or it's at a transient turning-point between expanding and <br>
  contraction;<br>
<p>
  * it's contracting now;<br>
<p>
  * it's spinning (but -- say those logical positivists -- it can't spin <br>
  absolutely).  It would also have a different cross-section or shape.<br>
<p>
  * Something else weird is going on.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
  Now retrace these steps, armoured with &lt;inter alia&gt; Eric J. Lerner's <br>
  brilliant work "The Big Bang Never Happened" (Simon &amp; Schuster, [1988] <br>
  -- a glorious book, very good on the embedded moralities and <br>
  epistemologies of physical theories, most of which are _appalling_.  <br>
  Don't import your enemies' anti-extropic concepts all unwitting.<br>
<p>
  Instead, our evolving Open Universe is infinite in all directions <br>
  (Smass, Length and Time), with emergent -- novel -- qualities<br>
<p>
  Einstein's old GR idea of a closed but unbounded Riemannian space where <br>
  nothing ever changes (determinist) is defunct (See Popper, 'Unended <br>
  Quest'), and utterly dependent on bad methodology and bad physics.  <br>
  Einstein himself said it GR was in error many times.  He asked for 'a <br>
  more objective way.'<br>
<p>
  Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic Cardinal, proposed in [1440] an infinite <br>
  Euclidean Universe with an infinity of other planets circling other <br>
  suns, many of them populated by beings like (as well as different from) <br>
  ourselves.  This predated Copernicus!  He had no trouble from the <br>
  Vatican 'thought-police' becaude he wasn't proposing _heliocentrism_ <br>
  ('Mithraism').  Anything less was uncharacteristic of an infinite God.<br>
<p>
<p>
  The background radiation is the product of particle interactions, and <br>
  also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'<br>
<p>
  A ballistic (particle) theory of light describes, predicts and explains <br>
  the interactions nicely. See: 'Relational Mechanics' (120k paper) on:<br>
<p>
                  <a href="http://www.demon.co.uk">http://www.demon.co.uk</a><br>
 <br>
  and numerous articles in 'Apeiron' (clicker) and Galilean Electrodynamics.<br>
<p>
 And there's NO 'entropic heat-deat' in Relational Mechanics' -- the <br>
 ballistic photons (the building-blocks of matter) are reshaped by <br>
 gravitational accretion into new stars.  It's an _eternal_ system.  Very <br>
 extropic!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
 NASA use Relational Mechanics -- it's real easy to use!  So can you!<br>
<p>
 Enjoy!!!  &gt;:-}<br>

  Max:  There's a fine book "Mind in Science" [1981] by Professor Richard <br>
  Gregory (he's here at Bristol University) which is 'an exploration of <br>
  the significance of ideas and experimental findings in the study of Mind <br>
  and Matter, from pre-Socratic Greece to the present day.'<br>

  Max: I remember that the last time we met was in Bristol, at Temple <br>
  Meads Station. The Science Exploratory (which Dr. Gregory was active in <br>
  promoting) has a permanent home there now.  Kids love the place! &gt;:-}<br>
