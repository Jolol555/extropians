<i>&gt; I seem to remember reading an article that stated that the very centre of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the core was a massive crystal(I think of iron)  How was this determined?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, don't quote me on this, but I think either someone shot some time of</i><br>
<i>&gt; EM radiation through the earth and measured it's distortion on the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; side (of course, the radiation would be altered differently depending on</i><br>
<i>&gt; how it entered the grain of the crystal)  Hmm... that doesn't sound like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; very likely scenario now that I think about it.  </i><br>
<p>
No, no known EM radiation is strong enough to pass through the whole<br>
earth. Neutrinos of course pass through it all the time, but they<br>
don't reveal much. So this explanation sounds bogus, as you say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about this: when an</i><br>
<i>&gt; earthquake occurs on the other side of the planet, you measure how long it</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes to go through the diameter of the earth.  The time it takes should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be influenced by the direction the shock wave passes through the crystal.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds like a reasonable way of determining if it is there or<br>
not; anisotropy should be easy to detect. I took a brief dive into the<br>
web and found references to inner core anisotropy, and these pages:<br>
<a href="http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/tromp01/node2.html">http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/tromp01/node2.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/amsci/articles/95articles/Wysession-full.html">http://www.sigmaxi.org/amsci/articles/95articles/Wysession-full.html</a><br>

which seems to support the crystal idea. It may not be a single<br>
crystal, but a lot of them packed together.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Apparently, the arrangement of the domains of this large iron crystal</i><br>
<i>&gt; explain the earth's large magnet field.  Also, one could explain pole</i><br>
<i>&gt; shift(not the kind Danny was talking about!) by the inversion of this iron</i><br>
<i>&gt; crystal, which might be induced by some external magnetic field... a large</i><br>
<i>&gt; metallic asteroid?  Sorry I'm being so vague... has anyone else read the</i><br>
<i>&gt; article to which I am poorly alluding?</i><br>
<p>
This sounds bogus, since the mass (and hence possible magnetic dipole<br>
moment) of asteroids are orders of mangitude less than the earth. <br>
<p>
The most popular current theory is that the magnetic field is produced<br>
by dynamo currents in the liquid outer core, driven by the earth's<br>
rotation. The shifts in the magnetic field are caused in this model by<br>
chaotic shifts between two parts of the same attractor. No need for<br>
ultra-magnetic asteroids.<br>
