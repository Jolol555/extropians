      Hello, all!<br>
<p>
      My friend jrt@cix wrote to me, after reading my comments to Carl <br>
      Feynman, sayiong that he thought my dismissal of overly mathematical <br>
      treatments of physics was a bit cavalier, and might make it more <br>
      difficult for people to understand what I aim to get across.<br>
<p>
      It is my contention that Classical Physics was misled by Huygens' <br>
      'wave theory of light' diversion, and Maxwell's beautiful <br>
      electromagnetism (as distinct from the particle theory of light; and <br>
      the Continental and faradayan electromagnetic programmes of Weber, <br>
      Helmholtz etc.). Alfred O'Rahilly's "Electromagnetics: A Discussion <br>
      of Fundamentals' is excellent on this issue -- the book is described <br>
      by Popper in his 'Postscript' as excelling in the literature <br>
      critical of 'relativistic' theories.<br>
<p>
      We now know that a particle theory of light can do all the 'wave' <br>
      stuff anyway; amd that we can get Maxwell's handy equations as a <br>
      first approximation from relational forces propagated at 'c' <br>
      relative to their source.  So we're back on track now (anyway, at <br>
      least some of us are... &gt;:-} ).<br>
<p>
<p>
  It may assist understanding to think about Relational mechanics thusly:<br>
<p>
[A] Take Classical Mechanics: (Start with T.W.B. Kibble's fine text):<br>
[B] Add relational electric and magnetic and gravitational forces:<br>
[C] Add a velocity of force propagation ('c'), which delays far-action:<br>
[D] Add a full ballistic ('particle' or 'photon') theory of EM radiation.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The _basic_ maths is straightforward, although some of the force <br>
      interactions are fiendishly complex to calculate.  That's why we use <br>
      (say) statistically-based approximation methods like Quantum <br>
      Mechanics.  "The computer is your fiend!"<br>
<p>
      There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture' <br>
      approach to physics and cosmology (i.e. my preference, and <br>
      Popper's); and the instrumentalist 'reified' mathematical approach.<br>
<p>
      However, my basic thesis is identical to Heisenberg's statement:<br>
<p>
     "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exatly 'right' wherever its <br>
      concepts can be applied." -- Werner Heisenberg.<br>
<p>
<p>
     I propose that this means _everywhere_.   Classical Mechanics is the <br>
     most self-consistent, the conceptually clearest, the strongest, the <br>
     most coherent, the most extendable and the most adaptable Scientific <br>
     Research Programme the world has ever seen.  And one theory does it <br>
     all.  Why use anything else, is all.  "Simplify! Simplify!"<br>
<p>
     As a matter of fact, I think it's actually _true_.  I've never read a <br>
     convincing refutation of Classical Mechanics.  Someone would have to <br>
     disprove one or more of the axioms; or break the deductive chains.  I <br>
     don't think that's actually possible.  Does anyonwe here think that <br>
     geometry is _empirically decideable_?  I.e. Euclid vs. Minkowski or <br>
     Euclid vs. Riemann ?  Do tell!!!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
     Classical Mechanics is certainly exactly accurate to the present <br>
     limits of measurement, AFAICS.  It shows every prospect of extension <br>
     without limit - it scales cleanly from cosmic down to the microworld.<br>
<p>
     What more can anyone possibly ask for?<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
     Max:<br>
<p>
     On 'Frame Dragging.'  Insofar as gravitational force is propagated <br>
     radially as an intrinsic property of mass, and with a finite velocity <br>
     of propagation, we would expect something like 'frame dragging' to <br>
     occur. Different ways of interpreting the same data, is all.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
     Anton:<br>
<p>
     Electrons held in orbit by a balance of radial electric force against <br>
     inertial mass are in a condition analogous to 'free fall' or 'curved <br>
     space.'  They're not accelerating in a way which causes emission of <br>
     photons. The radial distance between the positive and negative <br>
     charges is _constant_, except for the periodic frequency fluctuation <br>
     as they wiggle round in closed sinewave paths at self-equilibrating <br>
     integer frequencies (See Beckmann [1987] for a complete explanation).<br>
<p>
     If they absorb or emit a photon, they increase or decrease in mass, <br>
     and the orbit adjusts.  If they change theior angular velocity, they <br>
     take up different orbits. The model works perfectly.  Bohr's basic <br>
     [1913] model works by ad hoc postulates, whereby I offer physical <br>
     mechanisms and hence physical explanations.  That makes RM a superior <br>
     theory!  More content!  What's the problem supposed to be?<br>
<p>
     All this 'electrons spiralling into the nucleus' stuff -- that is a <br>
     hangover from aether-drag theory.  There's no point in quoting <br>
     Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a (non-existent) aether to <br>
     transmit forces, whereas RM has relational -- Faradayan -- aetherless <br>
     forces.  See Berkson's 'Fields of Force' on this crucial point (he <br>
     was a postgrad student of Popper's at LSE, BTW).<br>
