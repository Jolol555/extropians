Hello folks:<br>
<p>
My original interest in the Extropians was to gain an insight on various<br>
opinions,<br>
and occassionally published "snippets" and references to scientific articles<br>
in regards to topics such as nanotechnology, life extension, alternative<br>
economic<br>
systems theories, and so on.<br>
<p>
Sadly, the "original" extropians I had become so attracted to years ago,<br>
seems<br>
to be slipping further and further into a quagmire of internal turmoil, and a<br>
general<br>
myre of postings not even remotely related to the thematic trajectories of<br>
what had<br>
initially been defined as "extropianism"<br>
<p>
how sad . . . . <br>
<p>
just an opinion from a "relative" outsider, looking in<br>
<p>
sincerely<br>
C.O. <br>
