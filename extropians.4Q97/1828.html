<i>&gt; One technology that claims to allow humans to "rescript" themselves is</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).  A good book on NLP is "NLP: The New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technology of Achievment", by the NLP Comprehensive training team,</i><br>
<i>&gt; edited by Steve Andreas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Caveat:  I've been experimenting with NLP on myself for the past few</i><br>
<i>&gt; months, so my objectivity is quite possibly blurred.  However I must say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I find it both very interesting in the abstract, and very effective</i><br>
<i>&gt; when put to use.</i><br>
<p>
I'm a bit ambivalent about NLP. I have not yet read up heavily on it,<br>
but what I have read and tried seems to suggest that is mainly a large<br>
toolbox of more or less different tools with no real underlying Big<br>
Theory. That is of course not necessary as long as the tools work, and<br>
some certainly do. But at the same time I notice the tendency for<br>
"believers" of NLP to believe a little bit too strongly in it for my<br>
taste - it seems to have some memetic "cult potential" (I do not<br>
suggest it is a real cult, just that it somehow promotes a cohesion<br>
among NLPers and their beliefs that I find unhealthy for critical<br>
thinking and strict empirical testing). Since I also recognize that<br>
this may just be my prejudices talking, I get even more ambivalent.<br>
<p>
Are there any outside examinations of the efficiacy of NLP methods?<br>
