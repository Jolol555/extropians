Time for a good monkey wrench. Suppose the copy is provided with a<br>
"transfer of consciousness" experience which has the effect of "moving"<br>
from the original to the copy? After a few dozen of these where copy 1<br>
serves as the master for copy 2, .... to copy N, I would expect that<br>
said copy would have no problem with being destroyed after the copy<br>
operation. Note the contradiction here. Each copy expects continuation<br>
as the next copy in the series.<br>
<p>
BTW, I recall reading Clarke's 2001 and only then did HAL's behaviour<br>
make sense - HAL only saw the destruction of the spacemen, and not their<br>
continuation, ergo by first law of robotics, HAL had to prevent this.<br>
Point was NOT clear in the film...<br>
