Thanks Damien. SOunds like another case of the famous Maya fraud of the<br>
30's, where socialist/communist sympathizing archaeologists from British<br>
and American Ivy League schools developed the preposterous and<br>
completely unsupported, and eventually debunked theories that the Maya<br>
civilization was a socialist paradise of peaceful, communistic, unarmed<br>
innocent heathens.<br>
<p>
As it turns out, nothing could have been further from the truth.<br>
Following a successful harvest, the preist/god/king typically had a<br>
ceremony in which he sought the advice of the gods/ancestors, etc. by<br>
piercing his penis with a series of sharpened splinters from different<br>
trees. The pattern of splattered blood that formed supposedly told him<br>
what the gods wanted, or that the hallucinogenic state the preist was in<br>
gave him the illusion he was talking to the gods. In any event, the<br>
message almost invariably was this: GO TO WAR.<br>
<p>
Now the current politically correct theory of central american native<br>
history was that the crash of that civilization around 800 AD was the<br>
result of their completely deforesting the Yucatan area. "Let that be a<br>
lesson to you!"<br>
<p>
Australian abos I am not as familiar with, but given the<br>
bloodthirstyness of New Guineans, Tahitians, and Hawaiians, I would not<br>
doubt that any "socialist/pacifist paradise" theory of current<br>
Australian intelligentsia is about as accurate as the Maya one.<br>
