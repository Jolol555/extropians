I've been exposed to the "survivalist" movement via friends for about 20<br>
years.  Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were a lot of<br>
people predicting similar hard times ahead.  At the time, unemployment<br>
was high, and inflation was very high, about 15% or more.  My friends<br>
were buying guns, buying gold, stockpiling food.<br>
<p>
We got through that crisis OK.  Inflation and unemployment today are<br>
the best they've been in decades.  Predictions of imminent doom stayed<br>
through the 1980s and early 1990s.  The budget deficit was growing<br>
inexorably, bank failures were on the increase, we were heading towards<br>
fiscal disaster.  When this list first started we had several members<br>
who were convinced that economic collapse was just around the corner.<br>
<p>
We got through that OK, too.  The deficit is decreasing, bank failures are<br>
down.<br>
<p>
The newest doom prediction is the year 2000 (Y2K) problem.  The intricate,<br>
interdependent financial community will be incapacitated when the<br>
inevitable problems occur.  Even businesses with their own houses in order<br>
will fall when their debtors and creditors are unable to do business<br>
with them around the Y2K transition.  It's a big house of cards and it<br>
is sure to collapse, given that a significant fraction of members are<br>
taken down.<br>
<p>
Actually I think this one has some credibility.  I recall after the 1987<br>
stock market crash there were articles saying that it was almost a lot<br>
worse, that a chain reaction of bank and investment failures was aborted<br>
only by extraordinary intervention.  On the other hand the Y2K problem<br>
won't all occur on one day; problems will start to occur and gradually<br>
get worse as the transition approaches.  This will give people time to<br>
start adjusting to the problem.  Maybe it won't be as bad as it seems.<br>
<p>
Once we get past that, I don't see any particular reason why the US<br>
should break up or go fascist within 15 years.  We've gotten through<br>
hard times in the past without this happening.<br>
<p>
What do you see ahead that suggests as high as a 50% chance of this<br>
kind of change?<br>
