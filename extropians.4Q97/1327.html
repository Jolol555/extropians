<i>&gt;Steve Witham:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;[Bey] is specifically challenging us to come up with a critique of tech.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Kathryn Aegis:<br>
<i>&gt;I see an underlying question:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Should Extropians devise a critique on tech in response to Bey, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;should we devise one for our own reasons?...after all the raves I</i><br>
<i>&gt;hear about Bey, it somewhat disappoints he would appeal to this style.</i><br>
<p>
Whoa.  It's me who used the word "challenge."  What Bey said was that<br>
we need one and we don't have one.  If you agree that we need one, then<br>
that's your own reason.  I have my own reasons.  Reaction to Bey isn't<br>
the reason--he just happens to be correct.<br>
<p>
Dan Clemmensen:<br>
<i>&gt;I have an incredibly simplistic view of the future: we either embrace</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, or we die.</i><br>
<p>
So far, that is incredibly simplistic, I must admit.<br>
The AA Prayer is my paradigm for any debate on tech:<br>
   God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>
   courage to change the things I can,<br>
   and wisdom to know the difference.<br>
<p>
You've summarized the first line of the prayer, which is something,<br>
I'm not joking: these basics need to be said, and sorted out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reason is simple: population. There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;known non-technical way to stop the population from growing,</i><br>
<p>
Some recent (&amp; controversial) survey said that around the world, when<br>
*women* are reasonably educated, they decide how many kids to have based<br>
on fairly rational estimates of the economic prospects for the kids.<br>
Btw "we have the technology already", &amp; it doesn't cost $6M.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;IMO anyone who argues against technological advancement...</i><br>
<p>
None of those here, as far as I know.  A "critique of tech" would be<br>
an approach to thinking about what kinds (aspects? applications?<br>
directions? etc?) of tech are good, what are bad, and why.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are now left with arguments about the nature of the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt;change</i><br>
<p>
Quite so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again, I feel that there is really not much we can do to</i><br>
<i>&gt;guide the advance.  Technological change in this era is driven by</i><br>
<i>&gt;software, and software development is now very distributed and</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncontrollable. This means that arguments about the moral and</i><br>
<i>&gt;ethical aspects of technological change are interesting, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;have no practical point, since the change is uncontrollable.</i><br>
<p>
I love how this argument zooms around in a loop a couple of times<br>
and then ends up where it started, only with its motor hot and its arms<br>
all twisted around pointing at itself.  By the way, the general idea<br>
is called "technological inevitability," and is well known, if not<br>
well respected, in arguments about tech.<br>
<p>
My start on an answer is that tech change consists of people making<br>
decisions based on ideas.  If you lump people's thinking into "tech<br>
change," then of course we can't change the course because our thoughts<br>
have already been accounted for in your idea of "tech change."  We will<br>
think what we will think, do what we will do, and que sera, sera.<br>
But if you unplug the short-circuited argument, tech doesn't change<br>
by itself at all.  It *only* does what we want it to.  The question is<br>
how wise we can be, and what would wisdom consist of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...IMO, the only way an individual can affect the change is</i><br>
<i>&gt;to try to introduce and advance useful, non-detremental changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;as fast as possible, while analyzing and warning against possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;detremental effects.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds good!  Now you've got to the second line of the prayer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given the historically accelerating rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt;change, I feel that any atempt to make non-technical changes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;society (i.e., a new ethic, a new religion, a new educational system,</i><br>
<i>&gt;a new form of government) will take too long to have an important</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect on technological change: by the time such a slow-acting change</i><br>
<i>&gt;can have an impact (order 25 years) technology will have</i><br>
<i>&gt;changed society beyond all recognition.</i><br>
<p>
Is it necessary to make massive changes or just introduce good ideas?<br>
Remember, the same process that produces the change--people thinking--<br>
is steering the change.  They are identical.  It's all just choices.<br>
And people don't make the next change until they've absorbed the<br>
previous one.  New things are only produced by people thinking new<br>
thoughts.  So it can't be that tech change happens faster than<br>
people's ability to change their thinking, since the latter is what<br>
produces the former, one idea at a time.<br>
<p>
And these are only preliminary, preliminary thoughts.<br>
<p>
Please don't take my teasing style as unappreciative of the time and<br>
thought you're putting into this.  More than I am at the moment--I'm<br>
just regurgitating things I've thought before.  Scoping out the<br>
situation--what we can and cannot affect about tech evolution--in a<br>
cold-blooded way is exactly to the point.  It's the third line of the<br>
prayer.<br>
<p>
Harry S. Hawk said some wise things summarizing (and echoing the<br>
prayer!) with:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We can accept tech  -- That's the first step!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The 2nd step is to find the best tech and the best approaches and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;find out the ideas that seem great (like lead pipes) but aren't once you</i><br>
<i>&gt;get additional knowledge (e.g., lead is a poison).</i><br>
