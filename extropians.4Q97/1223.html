<i>&gt;rate far exceeding the ability of the body to replace them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think cultured organs would be much more practical than body transplants.</i><br>

<p>
 There are always ways to get by problems.<br>
How about transplanting the spine with the head.<br>
How about growing a new tailored spinal cord for implantation?<br>
How about cybernetics?<br>
I'm not saying it won't take a huge amount of work.<br>
I'm not saying it would be 100% effective.<br>
Do these ideas make it seem even a *little* bit more likely?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
 This is a topic I have been thinking about quite a bit lately <br>
and I have come to a conclusion <br>
that the less work my brain has to do the better.<br>
The entire body below the neck <br>
will most certainly be able to be replaced/repaired <br>
before the brain will.<br>
So that is what I care about <br>
and must go to extremes to protect.<br>
Chop off my arms and legs,<br>
in a couple of years I will rejoice because I will still be ALIVE!<br>
<p>
 If I did have no limbs,<br>
what would happen to the parts of the brain <br>
that used to control them?<br>
Those areas would be taken over by other areas.<br>
There was a man who lost his hand <br>
and the hand control area of his brain <br>
was used by his face control area.<br>
Touch a part of his cheek <br>
and he feels it on his fingertip control area.<br>
That man has a very sensitive cheek!<br>
<p>
 Now think about my whole body control area <br>
being taken over by my head control area.<br>
Imagine the processing power, <br>
a full brain used almost entirely for thinking!<br>
I'm not saying it would be easy.<br>
It would take decades of intense mental training<br>
to learn how to use my brain to it's full potentional.<br>
It would take alot of getting used to,<br>
because I'd be the worlds shortest goddamned genius. :-)<br>
<p>
Ok, ok...<br>
I'm not so sure the theory is sound<br>
but it's worth thinking about.<br>
