<i>        &gt;What more you could possibly demand of teleportation?   </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;How about being able to duplicate macroscopic objects, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps someday, but nobody has claimed to have done that yet. Teleportation <br>
means going from point A to point C without going through point B, I said <br>
they've done that with photons, you said they did not.                               <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;molecules, their temperature, chemical bonds, etc. None of this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;*needs* quantum  mechanics, because these properties can be        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;described classically.  </i><br>
<p>
Nonsense, if classical physics was correct matter wouldn't even be stable.  <br>
There is no way atoms or molecules can be understood with ideas Newton or <br>
Maxwell would be comfortable with, and there is no way the nature of the <br>
chemical bond can be understood without quantum mechanics. In high school <br>
chemistry they make you memorize rule of thumb approximations, like valances <br>
and the periodic table, that sort of thing can be useful in simple cases <br>
involving small molecules, but without quantum mechanics  you can't have the <br>
slightest understanding of why those rules are what they  are. And much more <br>
is required for the really interesting stuff, like how  enzymes work, or why<br>
proteins fold up the way they do, or where their reactive site is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there are classical (Newtonian) elements of the state, and Quantum        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;elements of the state.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All states are quantum states. Classical states are only approximations,  <br>
sometimes good and sometimes very bad approximations of quantum states. <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I suppose I should clarify that by "quantum state", I  mean things         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;like the spin, which are describable only by quantum mechanics and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;by no other branch of physics.</i><br>
 <br>
<p>
That just demonstrates the superiority of Quantum Mechanics, spin effects  <br>
every other branch of physics, and every branch of life for that matter, and <br>
all matter for that matter. The Pauli Exclusion Principle explains why many <br>
particles with integer spin, like photons, can be in the same quantum state <br>
but no two particles with half integer spin, like electrons, can be. <br>
A pretty esoteric idea that has no consequences in the everyday world, right? <br>
Wrong.<br>
<p>
If photons had half integer spin and thus 2 photons could not be in the same  <br>
place at the same time then you couldn't see the moon or the stars or even  <br>
the man sitting next to you. Photons from an object you wanted to look at  <br>
would collide and be hopelessly scrambled by photons moving at right angles  <br>
to them. You'd be blind as a bat.<br>
<p>
Even worse, if electrons and protons had integer spin there would be nothing <br>
to prevent even the earth's weak gravity from collapsing matter into a <br>
mathematical point turning the planet into a black hole.<br>
          <br>

<i>        &gt;a *completely identical* brick, in all respects down to every last         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;atom in every position, except the quantum state of all its         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;constituent atoms and molecules</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Is this a riddle? How can two bricks be completely identical except for being  <br>
totally different down to the very smallest detail?<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;&gt;The exact quantum state of your brain is almost certainly far more         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;information than you'd need to duplicate consciousness, but it's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;definitely not irrelevant.               </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It may or may not be relevant.  You've made no argument that it is.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Please do so.</i><br>
<p>
Since the quantum state of your brain is all the information there is to know <br>
about that object it must be relevant, I don't see why argument is necessary, <br>
unless you're trying to make a case for a soul.                                                <br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;An MRI makes dramatic changes on the quantum level, but absolutely         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;*no* detectable change in the personality, memory, etc., of the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;individual.  </i><br>
<p>
I think the enormous magnetic field in the largest MRI machines can be <br>
detected by some people, I don't claim this fact has any great relevance to  <br>
this discussion however.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Things like the spin are describable *only* by Quantum Mechanics,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and have no meaning in classical physics.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, and that doesn't mean quantum effects are unimportant, it means  <br>
classical physics is inferior.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Quantum teleportation does not duplicate momentum. It doesn't         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;duplicate energy. </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
No. A photon has a well defined momentum and energy, if those weren't  <br>
duplicated then quantum teleportation has not happened, I've not read the <br>
article in Nature yet but apparently it has happened, unless fraud has been  <br>
committed and I doubt that.  <br>
