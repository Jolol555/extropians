<i>&gt; When I lived in Nebraska, all the gas contained at least 10% ethanol,</i><br>
<i>&gt; distilled locally from agricultural waste.  Not only did it make the gas</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheaper, but it burned cleaner and improved the octane rating as well.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; has never been clear to me why ethanol enhanced gas isn't available in many</i><br>
<i>&gt; places, such as California,...</i><br>
<p>
In California, we are protected from such common sense by CARB, the<br>
California Air Resources Board, who helps us out by mandating the<br>
use of MTBE in gasoline, a toxic substance that accumulates in <br>
groundwater, has unknown health effects, causes car fires by eating<br>
away fuel lines, and causes /more/ pollution by reducing the fuel<br>
efficiency of the cars that use it.  It's also very cheap, which is<br>
why the oil company lobbies purchased that particular regulation<br>
(after they had earlier purchased laws mandating that older under-<br>
ground fuel tanks be dug up and replaced whether or not they were<br>
leaking, to drive small gas stations out of business).<br>
<p>
Responsible environmentalists are not welcome in California poitics;<br>
most people here actually take the Sierra Club seriously, despite<br>
all the damage they've done.<br>
