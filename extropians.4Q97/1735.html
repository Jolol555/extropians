<p>
Maybe it's an idea to anounce a topic in the list and ask for <br>
the relevant people to speak up and mail to the one who<br>
asks for the topic to be discussed. Then he/she will become<br>
the owner (not the ruler) of the discussing process and will<br>
send everybody involved "CC" a mail with what he/she would like to <br>
achive. After this he/she posts the results (or updates) again in the list<br>
(with permission to quote). This last one is dangerous of course, <br>
since it could be that the whole thing starts again.....<br>
But we could invent some voluntary rule for this.<br>
