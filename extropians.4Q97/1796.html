<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;visual awareness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

I would have to disagree.  You are making a tight connection between the<br>
hardware and consciousness.  There is nothing special about a neuron that<br>
synthetic duplicate couldn't contain.  To say so appears to attach a<br>
mystical (and mythical) value to the individual neuron.  Specific aspects<br>
of your consciousness may be tied to specific parts of the brain, but only<br>
with respect to organization and interfacing.  As long as an artificial<br>
visual cortex maintains identical neural interfaces as the old one, and<br>
exhibits the same protocols as the meat cortex, the rest of your<br>
consciousness would have no means by which to tell the difference.<br>
<p>
There is nothing intrinsically phenomenal about how the visual cortex<br>
processes the color red.  The fundamental experience of red is only<br>
relevant to your consciousness in how it relates to the other parts of the<br>
brain.  If the rest of the brain receives the fundamental "red" signal as<br>
usual from a synthetic visual cortex, your consciousness will experience<br>
the usual fundamental red response.  Any subjective response from the<br>
consciousness is in response to the red abstraction created by the visual<br>
cortex.  The job of the cortex is to create and communicate that abstraction.<br>
