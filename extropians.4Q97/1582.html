As I explained Tom, I would like to stay out the discussion for a<br>
while to see what others think. However I feel to make sure that <br>
this statement above doesn't add more confusion, then there already<br>
is. I would like to say this: I told Tom several times I copied people<br>
on this. By doing this I made it public ! I feel on this particular<br>
issue It was the right thing to do. However, for future conversation, <br>
I can asure you, that all mail will be kept private. If Tom feels<br>
I did something "low" by sharing this information. I will apologize<br>
for this........ We copied so many people on<br>
this, that I think a lot of you were allready aware of this "problem"<br>
If I totaly miss judged this particular situation, please let me know.<br>
There was Honestly no intention to do any harm to the<br>
reputation of Tom. Our personal dispute was based on my emotions<br>
and should be in no way hold against Tom or Extropy.<br>
<p>
One thing I would like to say: I hope we can get this "history"<br>
factfile out very soon, so that we "or me personal as, let's say<br>
relative newbie" can prevent further miss comunication.<br>
<p>
Best regards,<br>
<p>
