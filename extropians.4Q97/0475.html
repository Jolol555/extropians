Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
This is the fourth in a series of articles on the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom.  The idea for this article was inspired<br>
by: At 12:52 PM 10/12/97, Geoff Smith &lt;geoffs@unixg.ubc.ca&gt;<br>

Anarcho-Capitalism and Economic Means to Freedom<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The *practice* -- as opposed to the theory, or<br>
communication without action -- of anarcho-capitalism<br>
is synonymous with what I've been calling the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom.  The practice of anarcho-capitalism<br>
is also the practice of the Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
<p>
So what might be "Ten things you can do to live an<br>
anarcho-capitalist life now!"?<br>
<p>
I've been a practicing anarcho-capitalist for more<br>
than 25 years.  Yet I find the above question tough<br>
to answer.  We're all in "different places" regarding<br>
our marketable skills, financial situation, knowledge<br>
of practical freedom, willingness to take risks, etc.<br>
<p>
So let me make a list of more than ten things.<br>
<i>&gt;From this list, select 10 things you think might</i><br>
be appropriate for you, then prioritize them into a<br>
sequence that is most appropriate for your individual<br>
situation, and then *do* them!<br>
<p>
1. Identify or develop some activity that enables you<br>
to earn money (in an honest manner) that is effectively<br>
invisible to terrocrats (terrorist bureaucrats or<br>
coercive political agents).  Examples: become a<br>
professional gambler; become a successful trader or<br>
investor, utilizing financial structures like offshore<br>
corporations, trusts, and/or foundations; sell "how-to"<br>
information related to your areas of expertise; organize<br>
seminars/workshops related to your areas of expertise;<br>
publish a newsletter; develop a course on practical<br>
anarcho-capitalism and market/deliver it via Internet.<br>
Check out &lt;<a href="http://www.loompanics.com/">http://www.loompanics.com/</a>&gt; for more ideas.<br>
<p>
2. Read the book 'The Incredible Secret Money Machine'<br>
by Don Lancaster, This book has partially inspired me<br>
to create a number of "money machines" that provide me<br>
with income streams invisible to terrocrats.  Check out<br>
his website &lt;<a href="http://www.tinaja.com/">http://www.tinaja.com/</a>&gt;, for an example of<br>
an Internet-based business.  Also check out Dr. Hewitt-<br>
Gleeson's "School of Thinking" &lt;<a href="http://www.sot.com.au/">http://www.sot.com.au/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
3. Study the 'Millionaire Reports' which contain a wealth<br>
of money-making principles not available anywhere else<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/millmain.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/millmain.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
4. Organize a group of people to meet, share information,<br>
and brainstorm the specific things each anarcho-capitalist<br>
individual might do.  Ideas for new anarcho-capitalist<br>
businesses may be generated.  Business partnerships could<br>
be formed.<br>
<p>
5. Improve your degree of privacy.  Set up "alternatives"<br>
that are more private than your "public persona."  Check<br>
out &lt;<a href="http://www.orlandomaildrop.com/">http://www.orlandomaildrop.com/</a>&gt;.  If you do some<br>
WWW searching and you follow links, you may find several<br>
dozen organizations that provide information and services<br>
that facilitate the practice of anarcho-capitalism.<br>
Check out &lt;<a href="http://www.paladin-press.com/">http://www.paladin-press.com/</a>&gt;.  Check out<br>
&lt;<a href="http://rogue.northwest.com/~4thhours/fringe/edenhome.htm">http://rogue.northwest.com/~4thhours/fringe/edenhome.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
6. Learn to operate in ways that minimize or eliminate<br>
"paper trails" that provide terrocrats with information<br>
they could use against you.  For example, use credit cards<br>
issued by offshore banks.  Find private ways to handle<br>
all or much of your banking needs.  See the financial<br>
institutions mentioned in the first article of this series<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
7. Improve your marketing skills.  Check out Dr. Hewitt-<br>
Gleeson's "NewSell" course at &lt;<a href="http://www.sot.com.au/">http://www.sot.com.au/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
8. Adopt an attitude of constantly looking for incremental<br>
advantages in life generally -- &lt;<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/">http://www.neo-tech.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
In exploring Neo-Tech, I find it useful to distinguish<br>
between any material with the word "Zon" and other material.<br>
I find much of the other material quite useful.  Some of<br>
the "Neo-Tech Advantages" as well as the information on<br>
"neocheating" I find particularly valuable.<br>
<p>
9. Develop your thinking skills.  I suggest you start with<br>
Dr. Michael Hewitt-Gleeson's "Brain Freebie" course at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.sot.com.au/">http://www.sot.com.au/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
10. If you work for a company, explore the possibility<br>
of setting up your own business (doing whatever you're<br>
now doing for the company), and having your business<br>
provide these services to the company.  Note that this<br>
is different from being a "private contractor."  The<br>
company doesn't contract with you as a private contractor;<br>
it contracts with "your business," which is an entity<br>
separate from you.<br>
<p>
11. If it's appropriate for you, and you can do so legally<br>
and safely, exit whatever tax systems you may currently<br>
subscribe to.  As with an e-mail list, you always have<br>
the option to "unsubscribe" -- though some instances are<br>
more difficult and dangerous than others!<br>
<p>
12. Subscribe to the Advanced Freedom Solutions list.  It is<br>
especially designed for practicing anarcho-capitalists, and<br>
aspiring anarcho-capitalists &lt;<a href="mailto:AFS-request@involved.com">mailto:AFS-request@involved.com</a>&gt;<br>
with SUBSCRIBE in the body of your message.<br>
<p>
13. Take creative action to safeguard assets from terrocrats<br>
and other thieves and robbers.  Organize your affairs so you<br>
own nothing of great value, but you benefit from entities such<br>
as trusts, offshore foundations and/or corporations, etc. that<br>
own certain assets.  Check out &lt;<a href="http://www.nestmann.com/">http://www.nestmann.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
Also search WWW for books by Adam Starchild.<br>
<p>
14. Become a "permanent tourist" (PT) -- wherever you happen<br>
to be at any time, you're "just a tourist staying for a short<br>
time and then moving on" -- &lt;<a href="http://www.bitnet.co.uk/scope/">http://www.bitnet.co.uk/scope/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
15. Check out the free-enterprise financial institutions<br>
mentioned in the first article of this series and get involved<br>
with them as appropriate &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
Check out 'Laissez Faire City" &lt;<a href="http://www.lfcity.com">http://www.lfcity.com</a>&gt;.  Also<br>
contains important information on individual sovereignty.<br>
<p>
16. Check out "Counter-Economics" as described by 'The Agorist<br>
Institute' at &lt;<a href="http://agorist.com/">http://agorist.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
17. If your psyche includes a wimp that is shit-scared of "the state"<br>
or "the government," check out &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt; in<br>
general and &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm</a>&gt; in particular.<br>
Increase your personal power &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
18. Learn to operate in a manner such that that you focus on<br>
taking actions under your direct control.  You want to do things<br>
that are directly linked to the results you wish to achieve.<br>
If you have to beg others to change their behavior in order for<br>
you to succeed, you tend to lose your power.  For example, if<br>
like Wes Burt you beg "the establishment" to take notice of<br>
Peter H. Rossi's "Iron Law" or Burt's "Teflon Topic," the<br>
most likely result is that you render yourself powerless.<br>
(By his own admission, Wes has been going at it since 1969,<br>
without producing any results!)<br>
<p>
19. Observe the results -- or lack of results -- you produce<br>
and learn from them.  Become more flexible.  Experiment.  Change<br>
strategies and tactics until you find what works.  And keep<br>
improving that.  (During the past four years, people have made<br>
of the order of $100 million in the free-enterprise sector as a<br>
result of information at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;.)<br>

<i>&gt;Which goes along the lines of something John Clark once said</i><br>
<i>&gt;(I paraphrase): "Anarcho-capitalism has become feasible because</i><br>
<i>&gt;we have the technology to maintain it."  This statement says</i><br>
<i>&gt;we have the *potential* to maintain an anarchy, but how do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually do it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
20. Discover that you are free and sovereign by nature.  Read<br>
Harry Browne: 'How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World' and<br>
Rose Wilder Lane: 'The Discovery of Freedom' -- both available<br>
from &lt;<a href="http://www.laissezfaire.org/">http://www.laissezfaire.org/</a>&gt;.  Check out the "sovereign<br>
individual paradigm" at &lt;<a href="http://colossus.net/wepinsto/wshome.html">http://colossus.net/wepinsto/wshome.html</a>&gt;<br>
as well as &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
21. Learn "Freedom Technology" -- the practical knowledge, skills,<br>
and methods to live the free life of an anarcho-capitalist; the<br>
street-smart know-how to run rings around terrocrats and to outwit<br>
them at every turn; the *HOW* of the Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
The many links in this article mostly point to various aspects of<br>
Freedom Technology, starting with &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
22. Read 'Deep Anarchy' by Extropy cofounder Max More at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm</a>&gt; to discover that<br>
the entire world has always been in a state of anarchy.  Max<br>
More: ""Deep Anarchy" is the view that results from these<br>
thoughts; it is the idea that we *already* live in an anarchy."<br>
Mr. More emphasizes that, "There is no "State."  There are only<br>
individuals acting in a statist manner..."  We need to focus on<br>
"Bringing About a Better Anarchy."<br>
<p>
23. Study &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt; -- 'The<br>
Anatomy of Slavespeak' -- to discover the extent to which you<br>
may effectively have been oppressing yourself with your own<br>
words.  Study &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm</a>&gt; to<br>
discover some of the most basic factors that keep coercive<br>
political systems in place.<br>
<p>
24. Become superhealthy.  We need to outcompete and outlive<br>
terrocrats and their supporters.  In the near future I'll<br>
compile a compendium of my best health links and references.<br>
<p>
25. Study my series of articles on the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.  Watch out for future<br>
articles.<br>
