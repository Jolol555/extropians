(1) the "cleaning up" of free radical oxidants (single molecular oxygen with a<br>
double minus charge usually [O -2] by antioxidants.  These reduce the molecular<br>
destruction of our cells.  Aging is really "wear and tear" on the system and free<br>
radicals add to this thus accelerating the aging process.  Incidentally part of<br>
this molecular destruction os if DNA including (it is expected) damage to<br>
protooncogenes that are shut off during embryological development.  If free<br>
radicals damage a promoter site on a protooncogenes it could be turned on or<br>
triggered into fast embryological development i.e. cancer. I take my Centrum<br>
every day. :-)  (2) better diet.  Everyone has heard about the mice that lived<br>
longer with less (better?) food. (3) exercise (Tae Kwon Do is my favorite)<br>
<p>
Futuristically nanomachines (if/when they exist) may be able to detect and<br>
reverse molecular destruction as well. Gene therapy is only useful for specific<br>
clearly defined genetic diseases (genetic defects).  For NOW we can harvest spare<br>
body parts from an anencephalic (brain absent) clone when these parts (esp.<br>
heart, kidneys, liver and lungs, etc.) wear out.  This (presently possible) will<br>
work for a long time.  Eventually too many things will wear out and one will need<br>
a new copy of one's body.  This is where neuroregenerative techniques are<br>
important (see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/WebRegen.html">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/WebRegen.html</a>) so<br>
that the necessarily severed or transected spinal cord can be reconnected.<br>
