The way I see it, if it is to be advisable to create a sublist for a <br>
certain topic, then not only must there be a substantial number of <br>
people who are interested in that topic (this condition is clearly <br>
satisfied), but there also have to be a substantial number of people <br>
on the original list who are *not* interested in the topic -- <br>
otherwise, why can't we have the discussion on the main list? (We <br>
could even use a prefix like MIND: ). The main way I can think of how <br>
a transhuman mind-list could be useful is that it might pull in <br>
non-transhumsnists interested in the mind. But one would have to <br>
double-post a lot of messeges, or n-post, if one includes the <br>
transhuman mailing list, the philosophy of AI newsgroup, PSYCHE <br>
mailinglists...<br>
<p>
In conclusion, I am not convinced that there is at this point "enough <br>
necessity". But I would certainly join the list if it were created, <br>
since I don't want to risk missing any of the interesting posts <br>
that Mitch and others would contribute.<br>
