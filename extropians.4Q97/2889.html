In the interest of clear, concise and straightforward speech...as evidenced by<br>
the gun and other threads...this is put forth for everyone's consideration and<br>
enjoyment....<br>
<p>
                 PC Christmas  <br>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual<br>
 Yuletide celebration, and throughout the place of residence, kinetic<br>
 activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,<br>
 including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus (mouse).<br>
 Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood<br>
 burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure<br>
 regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among<br>
 whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.<br>
 <br>
 The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective<br>
 accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual<br>
 hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically<br>
 through their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our<br>
 nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the<br>
 hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the<br>
 grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt<br>
 compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose<br>
 of ascertaining the precise source thereof.<br>
 <br>
 Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this<br>
 fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,<br>
 reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,<br>
 might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus<br>
 permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature<br>
 airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the<br>
 genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and<br>
 nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our<br>
 anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may<br>
 possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar<br>
 predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through<br>
 contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her<br>
 respective cognomen - "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. - guiding them<br>
 to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I<br>
 could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven<br>
 pedal extremities.<br>
 <br>
 As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing<br>
 a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost<br>
 celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He<br>
 was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from<br>
 oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls<br>
 thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the<br>
 plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious<br>
 cloth receptacle.<br>
 <br>
 His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his<br>
 submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging<br>
 amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance<br>
 were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the<br>
 former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter<br>
 that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.  His amusing sub- and<br>
 supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their<br>
 ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and<br>
 columnar crystals of frozen water.<br>
 <br>
 Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey<br>
 fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a<br>
 decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was<br>
 high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region<br>
 undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical<br>
 container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund,<br>
 multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly<br>
 frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly<br>
 lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to<br>
 one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.<br>
 <br>
 Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the<br>
 aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned<br>
 articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously<br>
 dorsally transported cloth receptacle.  Upon completion of this task, he<br>
 executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral<br>
 juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a<br>
 gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by<br>
 renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself<br>
 in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of<br>
 air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of<br>
 burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable<br>
 chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard<br>
 his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation<br>
 beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary<br>
 constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a<br>
 salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between<br>
 sunset and dawn."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Merry....er.....Merry whatever<br>
