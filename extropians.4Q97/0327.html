<i>&gt;I've also poked some fun at some material you hold dear.&lt;</i><br>
<p>
   Actually, I don't hold Neo-Tech that dear. At the risk of sounding<br>
arrogant I consider myself an exceptional thinker. In fact, I would<br>
put myself in the same category with Nietzsche. Neo-Tech does<br>
not have all the answers and niether do I. Having studied philosophical<br>
systems from Taoism, to Objectivism, to Chaos Magic I can say<br>
that Neo-Tech is that missing link that shows the incredible<br>
power of human consciousness. All of these other paradigms<br>
have extremely useful aspects for thinking and for action but without<br>
the crucial identification of the difference between existence and<br>
human consciousness(made clear only by reading from the very<br>
first page to the very last page of _The Neo-Tech Discovery_)these<br>
other paradigms become useless in your pursuit of eternal happiness.<br>
   Your comment has provided me with a possible useful idea though.<br>
As a Chaos ritual I think I will burn my copy of _The Neo-Tech Discovery_<br>
tonight in a fiery blaze beneath the stars to destroy another "belief"<br>
and enhance my critical thinking ability.<br>
   Also(thanks again) this discussion has made me aware that these<br>
debates are sucking time(and therefore "life") out of my day so this<br>
will have to be my last post--I hope I answered your questions.<br>
(I am anticipating you New Age physicists who believe that time<br>
doesn't exist so as a bonus reading suggestion, if you act now, I<br>
recommend _The End of Certainty_ by Ilya Prigogine!!! :) ).<br>
