<i>&gt; As I will explain in a separate message, improving the signal/noise ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one goal of this change, but it's not the main one. Even if that doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen as expected, I think the move is desirable for ExI.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think anyone here would object to your using list membership<br>
simply for revenue.  I've never joined ExI simply because they've<br>
never offered anything of sufficient value for my money, and I don't<br>
give to charities.  If this list was a benefit of membership, you'd<br>
have my check tomorrow, becuause that's something of value.  Whether<br>
or not it improves the list itself isn't really as relevant to ExI's<br>
overall goals as simple revenue, is it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Wow, Damien, I'm glad you're not doing marketing for ExI! You didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention the Exponent newsletter that keeps members up to date on what's</i><br>
<i>&gt; happening and helps them network, the local meetings, or the substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt; discount on the EXTRO conference (that paid for half the dues this time</i><br>
<i>&gt; around).</i><br>
<p>
Wait a minute...the difference between the member and non-member prices<br>
for Extro3 was about $5 less than the cost of membership, so joining<br>
would not have been a significant savings (unless the member prices<br>
listed on the website weren't true).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Damien, I thought you were a student. If so, the rate is merely $30. Hardly</i><br>
<i>&gt; a burden. For those who think $95 is too much, note that Alcor yearly dues</i><br>
<i>&gt; are $360, The Life Extension Foundation (which uses membership to sell many</i><br>
<i>&gt; products) is $75, and the World Future Society professional membership is</i><br>
<i>&gt; $95 ($175 for full prof. membership).</i><br>
<p>
Well, Alcor is hardly a fair comparison: I get the emergency services<br>
of a trained cryonics team at my bedside for that money.  The others are<br>
more comparable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It does costs money to run an organization. The current membership dues are</i><br>
<i>&gt; insufficient and we don't want to ask yet again for donations. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand why so many capitalist-friendly people seem to expect us to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; all that we do with such a pitiful income.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing says a good capitalist can't be a cheap bastard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes. Many people just want to talk and not do anything, nor do they want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make it possible for others to do anything. We appreciate very much our</i><br>
<i>&gt; members, who are willing to back their values with a little cash.</i><br>
<p>
Let's hope ExI can demonstrate this time around that giving them money<br>
actually will accomplish something.  Rational capitalists, regardless<br>
of their commitment to a cause, won't part with a penny unless they think<br>
doing so will benefit the cause (and therefore themselves).<br>
