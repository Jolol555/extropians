<i>&gt;because they enjoy it.  Their driving force is coming from an inner</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to produce something beautiful (yes, computer programs can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;beautiful).  In a way, the Linux kernel is a work of art, produced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;some of the best programming artists that Earth has to offer, all in</i><br>
<i>&gt;their spare time, all directly out of their hearts.  When a bug</i><br>
<i>&gt;appears, it gets fixed quickly precisely *because* the artists suddenly</i><br>
<i>&gt;feel a pang of ugliness, and are compelled to fix it in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt;restore beauty.</i><br>
<p>
 If beauty were the main motivation, rather than a desire to use the<br>
software or to acquire a reputation as a good programmer, then we would<br>
see Linux hackers giving low priority to dealing with bugs that result<br>
from commercial hardware vendors' mistakes. I don't think that's what's<br>
happening.<br>
 From what I have seen of the Linux kernal and gcc source code, I'd say<br>
they are no more beautiful than the median for commercial software. gcc<br>
in particular had (last time I checked) a number of ugly lines that were<br>
accompanied by comments of the form "needed to handle a bug in the FooBar<br>
compiler v. 3.5".<br>
 Curiously, I seem to recall a much larger variation in beauty of commercial<br>
source code than in freeware. I wonder if this is due to a selection<br>
effect in what code I see (determined in part by who gets hired at the<br>
companies I work for), or in what code actually gets written?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Compare this to a software company with hundreds of programmers.  There</i><br>
<i>&gt;is *always* "dead wood" in a commercial product of this size.  That is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who are there solely because they need the money, not because</i><br>
<i>&gt;they *want* to be there.  These people can be non-productive, or worse,</i><br>
<i>&gt;can hinder the project as they produce code that is incomplete, buggy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or interacts badly with other sections of the code.  They simply are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not capable of going at it with their entire heart and soul like</i><br>
<i>&gt;freeware programmers do.  The result is shoddy software.</i><br>
<p>
 My experience has been that money can be as effective a motivator as<br>
anything else under the right circumstances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I know it sounds wishy-washy, but "having your heart in it" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;something that is too often neglected today.  Imagine, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;what this e-mail list would be like if instead of being *us*, it was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;bunch of people who were *paid* to argue the points we debate here, who</i><br>
<i>&gt;stopped arguing at lunch time and at 5pm, went home and watched TV all</i><br>
<i>&gt;night without ever thinking about the issues again until 9am the next</i><br>
<i>&gt;morning.  Do you think the debate would be as interesting?</i><br>
<p>
 That would depend a lot on exactly how their superiors decided whether<br>
to continue paying them. If their pay was contingent upon how many hours<br>
they spent writing arguments, the results would be worthless. If their<br>
pay was a function of the number of hits the mailing list archives got,<br>
the debate would probably be a bit more interesting than it is now.<br>
