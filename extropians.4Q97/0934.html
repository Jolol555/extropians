I seem to remember reading an article that stated that the very centre of<br>
the core was a massive crystal(I think of iron)  How was this determined?<br>
Well, don't quote me on this, but I think either someone shot some time of<br>
EM radiation through the earth and measured it's distortion on the other<br>
side (of course, the radiation would be altered differently depending on<br>
how it entered the grain of the crystal)  Hmm... that doesn't sound like a<br>
very likely scenario now that I think about it.  How about this: when an<br>
earthquake occurs on the other side of the planet, you measure how long it<br>
takes to go through the diameter of the earth.  The time it takes should<br>
be influenced by the direction the shock wave passes through the crystal.<br>
Apparently, the arrangement of the domains of this large iron crystal<br>
explain the earth's large magnet field.  Also, one could explain pole<br>
shift(not the kind Danny was talking about!) by the inversion of this iron<br>
crystal, which might be induced by some external magnetic field... a large<br>
metallic asteroid?  Sorry I'm being so vague... has anyone else read the<br>
article to which I am poorly alluding?<br>
