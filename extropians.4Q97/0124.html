The Latin alphabet, or just alphabets in general?  If you mean the English<br>

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  I meant go public with shares.<br>
Businesses tend to take a company more seriously when they can look them<br>
up on the stock market and get their annual business report.(although, if<br>
I'm not mistaken, Microsoft took its sweet time going public...)<br>
<p>
Whether businesses accept an OS will make all the difference for the<br>
company.  Just look at the success of IBM/Microsoft.  When the IBM<br>
personal computer was introduced, it was in no way superior to the apples<br>
already on the market.  It took off solely because businesses trusted IBM<br>
(because of their reputation with mainframes in the business world)  I<br>
can't see Linux really taking off until they start seeing $$$.  The market<br>
is huge, but Linux business sense appears to be lacking. (not that I have<br>
a problem with programmers programming for the sake of it.  I just hope<br>
someone comes along and gives Microsoft some worthy opposition)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Personal computers have the advantage is easy setup and use, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; applications, and advertising.</i><br>
<p>
Setting up personal computer is getting uglier and uglier.  I like<br>
Microsoft's "plug and play" concept, but, of course, it's not new.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In internal technical details they are</i><br>

<i>&gt; Java is being touted these days.  If Microsoft ported Word and Excel to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jave people at least wouldn't have to deal with Windows.  </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Java is not an OS, it's a programming<br>
language, a lot like C.<br>
