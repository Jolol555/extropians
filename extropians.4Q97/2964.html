 Brian D Williams thinks no such thing, Brian D Williams is<br>
provoking discussion by playing Devils advocate.<br>

<i>&gt;If you believe that if your children see a picture of 2 people</i><br>

<i>&gt;then it's your responsibility to stop them from seeing it, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;mine. Personally I don't think the matter is important so I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;lift a finger to help you, but they're your kids so I won't try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;stop you either, however if you use that tired old excuse to limit</i><br>
<i>&gt;my freedom I will fight you with everything I have, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;violence if I think I could get away with it.   </i><br>
                 <br>
I don't believe any such thing, (see above) I'm quite pissed to<br>
have my life limited in such a way, and I'll just ignore your<br>
threat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Besides with over 20,000 gun laws in this country, which in my  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;opinion is quite an effective ban, whats wrong with one little</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;law striking at the source.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For one thing, such a law has nothing to do with guns, it has to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do with speech and the inability of government to convince people</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do what they want. The only solution these gangsters can think</i><br>
<i>&gt;of is to use force to stop citizens from hearing the other side of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the argument.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It has everything to do with gun violence, which is a learned<br>
behavior. The gangsters you refer to, are in my opinion, the major<br>
television and cable networks which have written policys against<br>
running anything which might put gun ownership or use in anything<br>
except a negative role.<br>
  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Encryption is just Mathematics and a cryptograph program like PGP</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not an object, it's a sequence of bits. If you can't even stop</i><br>
<i>&gt;objects from entering the nation how on earth  are you going to</i><br>
<i>&gt;stop bits, bits  that can be duplicated endlessly at virtually no</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost,  bits that can be easily and very effectively hidden with</i><br>
<i>&gt;encryption, bits that can make use of the new communication</i><br>
<i>&gt;channels that open up daily to every part of the planet? </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I've been on cypherpunks since it was founded, have used PGP since<br>
it was created, have autographed copies of both of Schneier's<br>
book's on the subject, and now the truth can be told, was one of<br>
the many people who distributed it ahem .... widely. The major<br>
networks are not encrypted to the curb, much less the home, so your<br>
argument fails completely.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Some cable companies as well as TV stations already have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;voluntary anti-gun policies.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A cable company with a anti-gun policy? A cable company without</i><br>
<i>&gt;CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, HBO? A cable company that volunteers for</i><br>
<i>&gt;bankruptcy? I think not.</i><br>
<p>
As someone else already pointed out CNN has a written policy to<br>
this effect, as does CBS, the others you mentioned are rumored to<br>
as well. Don't believe it? try running an NRA commercial during<br>
prime time.....<br>
<p>
                    <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What it might do is put an end to "Hollywood Hippocricy" i.e.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Sylvester Stallones conscientious objector status during the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;vietnam war only to make million's playing a big gun shooting war</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hero later.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The man is not a war hero, the man is an actor and that's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfectly honorable profession. He showed intelligence in getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of the Vietnam war, more intelligence than most. When it's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;question of survival, when a bunch of goons want your labor and</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to enslave you so you can perform a very dangerous,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unpleasant, and pointless job for them 12 thousand miles away, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;do what you have to do to remain free. I wouldn't have held it</i><br>
<i>&gt;against him if he shot off his big toe to prevent it, or bribed</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone, or pretended to be insane, or showed up at the recruiting</i><br>
<i>&gt;office in a strapless evening gown.</i><br>
 <br>
I'm not questioning his choice about the Vietnam War, I've always<br>
thought the draft was wrong, and such things are a matter of one's<br>
own choice. I got in considerable trouble for supporting that<br>
position when I was in the USMC. I had a two star general tell me<br>
"unofficially" to cease and desist. By the way I was in Boot Camp<br>
during the fall of Saigon, I enlisted and was 17 years old at the<br>
time.<br>
<p>
You choose to call what he did after "a perfectly honorable<br>
profession" (acting), I call it hypocrisy.<br>
