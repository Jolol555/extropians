<i>&gt;&gt;Note that my definitions describe objectively observable phenomena.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Putting on my skeptic hat, I would make the following observations:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your definition of defense -</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;***"Defense" is an individual's proportionate resistance to a threat of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;subjectively valued loss of life, liberty, or possessions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;- relies on a number of other things whose definition can be contested.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll just hit the high points here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;'Proportionate' is a value judgement, and very subjective.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;'Threat' is in the eye of the beholder.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;'Possessions' is problematic, since some people (thieves) have possessions</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they do not have ownership over. Defending stolen goods from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rightful owner is clearly wrong (immoral).</i><br>
<p>
Clearly, recovering stolen goods is a proportionate response to a previous<br>
aggression.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your definition of 'aggression' - </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"aggression" is another individual's deliberate attempt to cause such</i><br>
<i>&gt;loss.***</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;- could easily be interpeted to mean that a rightful owner attempting to</i><br>
<i>&gt;recover stolen goods is acting aggressively. </i><br>
<p>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or perhaps his idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;'proportionate' differs from somebody else's, so how do we determine what</i><br>
<i>&gt;is (and is not) a correct proportionate response?</i><br>
<p>
By agreement. See below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyhow, those are some of the responses I've seen, and they do need a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer.</i><br>
<p>
A description of an objectively observable phenomenon must describe that<br>
phenomenon as it is, not as the observer wishes it to be.<br>
<p>
The distinction between "proportionate" and "disproportionate" is clear at<br>
it's extremes, and ambiguous in the middle. Still, it must be a part of the<br>
definition of A/D, because a disproportionate response transforms the<br>
defender into the aggressor.<br>
<p>
"Threat" is another term that is clear at the extremes and ambiguous in the<br>
middle. It must also be a part of the definition of A/D, because individuals<br>
clearly defend against credible threat.<br>
<p>
Note also that my definition could be applied to non-human A/D, and yes,<br>
defense against rising floodwaters, as well. The question is not whether we<br>
like the definition or not, but whether it accurately describes the<br>
phenomenon. If it does, then it is a universal definition.<br>
<p>
What does this all add up to? A/D is clearly distinguishable at it's<br>
extremes and ambiguous in the middle. All of the ambiguity must be worked<br>
out by agreement. For this, we need the right to consent. The right to<br>
consent comes from the primethic decision.<br>
<p>
In unilaterally deciding that defense against aggression, in the human<br>
context, is moral, and aggression, in the human context, is immoral, I am<br>
claiming the right to consent for myself, and reciprocoly offering the same<br>
right to all others, with the stipulation that I consider it moral to defend<br>
myself against aggression.<br>
<p>
If others make the same commitment (the primethic decision), we have the<br>
basis (Schelling Point) from which to negotiate further agreements.<br>
<p>
What falls out of the primethic decision is the basis of both rights and<br>
morality. It might well be called the libertarian decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;My criticism is not so much of your definitions as your tendency to regard</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;them as proof of your arguments. Why is aggression immoral? Your usual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;response is to say that it is immoral by definition. Even if your definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;were standard, it still doesn't answer the question.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I define it that way to distinguish aggression from violence. Essentially,</i><br>
<i>&gt;aggression is the immoral use violence (or fraud or whatever) against a</i><br>
<i>&gt;person who does not consent to the use of such violence. The usual example</i><br>
<i>&gt;to illustrate this is: boxing matches. Boxers are intent upon initiating</i><br>
<i>&gt;and inflicting injury each other - and usually do. Yet, it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;aggression. Somewhere in the definition of 'aggression' we need to include</i><br>
<i>&gt;the notion of 'consent'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I suspect you are trying to avoid the unavoidable, so let me answer the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;question for you. Aggression, *in your opinion*, is immoral, because you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have made the primethic decision. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know what a "primethic decision" is, or what factor(s) such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision might be based on. I doubt that I can decide much of anything</i><br>
<i>&gt;without first reasoning out the decision, and that can't happen if I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;know what factors are relevent. Consequently, I would have to say that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have made no "primethic decisions" whatsoever.</i><br>
<p>
Does the above help?<br>
