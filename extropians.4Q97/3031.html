&lt;sheesh&gt; this was only one example, hollywood is full of people who<br>
make a living shooting guns then walk around saying how they should<br>
be illegal.<br>
<p>
Politicians are even worse.<br>
<p>
1) The suburb of Morton Grove IL announces they are banning<br>
handguns, the news is carried worldwide,the Morton Grove council<br>
exempts itself (including concealed carry) and the wife of the<br>
mayor buys a handgun the next day.....<br>
<p>
2) 1983 The city of Chicago city council makes registering new<br>
handguns illegal, thereby effectively banning handguns within the<br>
city limits, they of course exempt themselves, and numerous Chicago<br>
alderman practice concealed carry......<br>
<p>
The list goes on and on...<br>
<p>
Since this thread is going nowhere, this is my last comment on the<br>
matter.<br>
