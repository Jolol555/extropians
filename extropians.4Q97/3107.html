True story this week from Florida:  7 yr. old boy throws tantrum for not<br>
getting his own way, kicks cat in head on way to room.  Cat lays there<br>
almost dead.  Boy gets 10 smacks on bottom with belt from father, leaves<br>
temporary marks.  Boy goes to school, complains his bottom hurts, <br>
teacher<br>
examines, sees marks, father gets arrested for child abuse and gets 24 <br>
hours<br>
in jail, court appearance  and fine.<br>
<p>
<p>
Being a cat lover and having W.C. Field's attitude towards most kids, <br>
I'm on the father's side. It's a good thing there is a statute of <br>
limitations, or most of our parents could be sued for child abuse. I <br>
remember my father belting me, and for good reason, on several <br>
occasions. And guess what? It did not warp me for life. I have very <br>
little patience with these "new age" type of parents who try to "reason" <br>
with their little brats while the little darlings are going on <br>
sociopathic rampages. Sometimes a few swats on the butt are just what is <br>
required to get the message across that the child's behavior is not <br>
going to be tolerated. Child abuse, my butt (pun intended). <br>
