I agree that we experience red (directly or indirectly), and I also agree<br>
that we know what red is "like." But I gave it a whirl, and I am as yet<br>
unable to describe red without reference to something else. I don't think<br>
"red" has any qualities other than redness.<br>

<p>
First, a machine that did so, need not do it abstractly. I think those<br>
with the counterpoint to your position are suggesting that if the brain<br>
can do it with physical components, a tech-based "brain" made of<br>
non-biological physical compnents should be able to do it. But this is a<br>
common argument which we see all the time around here. :-)<br>
<p>
The more controversial suggestion is that no matter how amazing our<br>
hardware "brain," there is no way to purposefully program the brain to<br>
experience a universal red signal. Specifically, and since I argue red has<br>
no qualities other than redness, the red "signal" some seem to be talking<br>
about may not be universal at all. Consider that in stimulating the optic<br>
nerve (or the visual cortex) we directly remove a step from the process of<br>
"seeing." If we've always experienced red by way of this step, and it has<br>
been circumvented, it is likely that the artificial signal we apply will<br>
not be the same as the signal we have come to identify as red. Especially<br>
since our subjective experiences have as much to do with what "red" is as<br>
does our ability to see color.<br>
<p>
The consequence, if this is valid, is that the only way to program such a<br>
manufactured brain to see red, is to provide it with a visible light<br>
detection device and let it "live" among redness for a while. Then it will<br>
be able to assign a textual label to the experience. Comments?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]  You'd be programming a computer to lie if you tried to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it describe what red was really like.</i><br>
<p>
It seems impossible without reference to something else.<br>
