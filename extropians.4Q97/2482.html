<p>
I first sent this to the list about a year ago, seemed like a good time to<br>
send it again.<br>
===========================================================================<br>
<p>
Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff  <br>
that has mass or energy or carries information. Strangely, some things have  <br>
none of these attributes, although calling them "things" may be stretching a<br>
point. It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate  <br>
instantly and for unlimited distances. One system can influence another  <br>
system on the other side of the universe without the slightest delay,  but it <br>
carries no information because the receiving system just changes from  one <br>
apparently random mode to another, it's only when you compare the two systems <br>
(and that can only be done at light speed or less) does the  correspondence <br>
between the two systems become obvious. The 2 random modes  have equal energy <br>
so energy is not transferred either.<br>
<p>
A less spooky example could be found in the idea of Phase Speed. I'm standing <br>
in the center of a huge hollow sphere 2 light years in diameter,  I've been <br>
there for a long time and I'm holding a powerful LASER that makes a  spot of <br>
light on the distant wall of the sphere one light year away.  Suddenly, still <br>
holding the LASER and in the space of one second I make a  complete 360 <br>
degree turn. Exactly 2 years later an observer standing at the same place <br>
would see the spot move much faster than light, it would travel  the entire <br>
circumference of the sphere, 2PI or 6.28 light years in only  one second. <br>
No photon moved faster  than light however, and no energy or  information <br>
between any two points traveled faster than light. A photon of  light moves<br>
at light speed and carries energy and information, a spot of light can move <br>
at any speed but carries neither energy nor information.<br>
<p>
And then there are Tachyons. Actually relativity does not forbid matter  <br>
moving  faster than light , it forbids matter moving AT the speed of light.  <br>
That's almost the same thing but not quite. Perhaps a particle could somehow  <br>
tunnel past the speed of light or maybe Tachyons have always moved faster  <br>
than light from the first instant of The Big Bang..<br>
<p>
People have looked for Tachyons but have never found the slightest evidence <br>
that they exist in nature, much to the relief of physicists. Tachyons are an <br>
embarrassment, the faster they move less energy they have, one that moved <br>
just a little faster than light would have a lot of energy, one that moved at an<br>
infinite velocity would have zero energy. Much worse, Tachyons move backward <br>
in time, they arrive at their destination before they start. You could <br>
communicate with the past.<br>
<p>
Even though they have never been detected and the laws of physics do not <br>
demand that Tachyons exist, they don't seem to forbid them either. Most think <br>
nature is totalitarian, if it's not forbidden then it's mandatory.<br>
<p>
What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with <br>
the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons? It would if anybody <br>
saw them, but suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her crime and <br>
brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.<br>
<p>
Damn, I just knocked my coffee cup off the table, what a mess! I'm REALLY not <br>
in the mood to clean it up, I think I'll use my Gateway 14,400 Tachyon modem <br>
and send myself some E mail 5 minutes ago. I'll just hit the send key and<br>
<p>
....brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me, <br>
I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be <br>
careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over." <br>
Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a <br>
safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means<br>
oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life, nature just will <br>
not allow anybody to observe a paradox.<br>
<p>
I know what you're thinking, How could John be so stupid, he must be <br>
completely out of his mind, why else would he deliberately buy an obsolete  <br>
14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the  <br>
28,800 model is too expensive, besides I have it on VERY good authority that <br>
Gateway will drop the price next year.<br>
