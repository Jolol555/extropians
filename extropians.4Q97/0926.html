<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the improvements in health.</i><br>
<p>
Many have said exercise is good <br>
but never has it been explained to me in a convincing manner.<br>
1-What are the health benifits besides strong hearts, lungs, and ankles<br>
(weak ankles cause many falls which lead to complications due to<br>
osteoporosis)?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; digestive system and the liver to be assimulated properly. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a dangerous and impossible long term practice and would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extremely foolish to initiate voluntarily. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years</i><br>
<i>&gt; after massive intestinal failure.</i><br>
<p>
2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?<br>
While I'm speaking of them,<br>
3-Have any tests been done to estimate the average length of life <br>
after specific nutrients are removed from the diet?<br>
I wonder how long it takes to die from each nutrient deficiency.<br>
4-What phrases could I use for a medline search?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; high altitudes may have increase longevity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,</i><br>
<i>&gt; leading to a similar oxygen saturation?</i><br>
<p>
 Possibly, but there is generally less O at higher altitudes.<br>
I imagine the red cell count balances the lack of O.<br>
<p>
High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,<br>
provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the capillaries.<br>
<p>
If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream<br>
(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)<br>
there are also increases in efficiency of temperature distribution,<br>
preventing hyper/hypothermia, thus leading to decreased free-radical<br>
production <br>
from sweating/shivering.<br>
<p>
 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) <br>
at high altitudes when they have a lack of white cells to fight them?<br>
<p>
 I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate <br>
if I increase my red cells and my O saturation.<br>
7-Any predictions?<br>
8-Hmm...any risk?<br>
<p>
Hej, Anders. :-)<br>
