Max:<br>
<i>&gt;Here's a possibility that I'd like to hear feedback on:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The current proposal is to make the Extropians list into a members-only</i><br>
<i>&gt;list for posting ability, but non-members could still read messages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instead, we could leave the Extropians list as it is, and create a new,</i><br>
<i>&gt;additional list, say ExI-Members, or Extropians-Special, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropians-Insider (or whatever has the appropriate elitist ring to it :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;). That would leave this list more open, but mean we have a more filtered,</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably higher S/N list, with clear guidelines for members, so we would</i><br>
<i>&gt;still have a new members-only benefit to add to the other membership benefits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I think it would be good to just have one list. Following multiple lists is<br>
a drag, and crossposts are a drag, and NOT following both lists you might<br>
miss something important. I don't think making the list members-only for<br>
posting would cut down on noise except for the tiny bit of spam we get, but<br>
it's ok with me. The idea of looking for more benefits to membership is a<br>
good one.<br>
