<p>
<i>&gt;Scale is part of it but there's more, let's start by considering the </i><br>
<i>&gt;question of corruption. The better job a private protection agency (PPA) </i><br>
<i>&gt;does, the more it can charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay </i><br>

<i>&gt;if they charge 10$ less. Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to </i><br>
<i>&gt;a dollar stolen directly from the PPA. For this reason it is in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;financial interest of the heads of the PPA to keep bribery of employees </i><br>
<i>&gt;as low as possible. Contrast that to the situation today, it doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is stolen from me, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving payoff money </i><br>
<i>&gt;from the thief. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: Scale is all of it. The only reason you have this <br>
 choice between PPA1 and PPA2, resulting in the favorable <br>
 incentives cited, is because PPA1 and PPA2 are SMALLER by <br>
 definition than government police forces which contain as <br>
 clients all people living within X region, whereas in the <br>
 PPA1 vs PPA2 scenario you can pick and choose * because *<br>
 you are external to their sphere of land ownership.<br>
<p>
 I think Kristen is exactly right to suggest that there's <br>
 no difference between large private and large government <br>
 scenarios.  "Gov't" as some special kind of entity is <br>
 a myth.  The economics of gov't are the economics <br>
 of large-scale land ownership, of monopoly.<br>
<p>
 It's not "moral sin" that makes gov't bad.<br>
 This is the "demystification" of gov't.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;The scenario you cite is not resolved by every inch of land being </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"privately" owned with every landlord having a set of rules, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;regulations, and rent. [...] You suggest that governments have this </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;unique attribute that if you stand on gov't property you are subject </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to gov't law, but the same holds for private property; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With government there is no place else I can go if I don't like it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but I can always find a landlord someplace who has rules I like, </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: So long as you have enough money to pay <br>
 all the rents and tolls in between you and him.<br>
 As soon as you ran out of money while looking<br>
 for that good landlord, you could quickly find <br>
 yourself in debt slavery. Granted many smaller<br>
 claims r better,  but the only difference in<br>
 the cost/benefit analysis comes down to the<br>
 size-of-land-claim differential, with the<br>
 larger having all the costs of monopoly.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; and in fact there is nothing stopping me from becoming a landlord myself.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: The price of land is one thing that could <br>
 stop you. Granted I agree that things will be<br>
 more favorable when there are more small land <br>
 claims to  choose services from,  but that's <br>
 what I'm saying: the only problems with gov't<br>
 stem from the fact that it's so big and thus<br>
 is so hard to say no to, i.e., hard to leave. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, I think Ian is doing us a favor in asking us to </i><br>
<i>&gt; examine our core beliefs from time to time, it's not good to </i><br>
<i>&gt; become complacent.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Thanks, John has the spirit of free inquiry, <br>
 refreshing indeed!  One of the most important things<br>
 for free thinkers to teach, more so than our pet memes<br>
 is to do and how to do the "memetic self-check." Always<br>
 challenge your memes and encourage the freedom of such<br>
 in ones "memetic identity group." One thing one finds<br>
 out fast in the conspiracy venues, is that any quest-<br>
 ioning of meme type x instantly results in one's <br>
 being seen as an defined as an "enemy agent"<br>
 by all meme type x propagators. <br>
<p>
 Such a reaction is antithetical to free inquiry,<br>
 and is a primitive memetic defense mechanism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are claims upon land and the claimants demand a rent/tax from </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;other people who inhabit the areas within the claims. When I got to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Earth, every inch was already claimed, so I have to agree to pay </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the fees, try to evade payment, or overthrow the claim.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I will admit that when you're talking about undeveloped land it's difficult </i><br>
<i>&gt;to make an airtight case for ownership based on natural law. If you go back </i><br>
<i>&gt;far enough in the history of any plot of land (except perhaps for</i><br>
Antarctica) <br>
<i>&gt;you will find that somebody stole it from somebody else, government land most</i><br>
<i>&gt;certainly not excepted, but we must deal with practicalities and it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;unrealistic to expect the way humans manage their affairs to be as neat and </i><br>
<i>&gt;tidy as the axioms of Geometry. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Yes, exactly; therefore the basis for any<br>
 definition of "preexisting ownership" is void <br>
 and the concept of "preexisting ownership" of<br>
 X must default to who owned X before I came<br>
 into existence or before I discovered X.<br>
<p>
 "Preexisting what?" Me. Others were first...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, land is not very important.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: It's as important as owning all of it <br>
  means owning the basis of everything, or <br>
  owning 70% of it means owning it all -30%.<br>
  Land owned is one of the most critical <br>
  factors in total control. Saying land is <br>
  not important and that gov't is a big<br>
  problem is incompatable, because it's <br>
  simply the claim to the ownership of so <br>
  much land that makes the gov't what it is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The thing that disturbs you is the way resources that were not produces by </i><br>
<i>&gt;human actions, land, was divided up, but that's only a small part of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;wealth or property of the country. In the USA the rental value of buildings </i><br>
<i>&gt;and land is only 13% of the value of all property, and most of that is in</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;buildings. Mineral wealth is another 3% and it would be zero is somebody</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't spend money and expend labor to get the minerals out of the ground. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: The capital value of land is but one <br>
 measure of it's power. The right to enforce<br>
 law and extract tax/rent upon all who find <br>
 themselves on it is the  major measure of <br>
 the power/value of land. You cannot deny<br>
 that fact and critique gov't at the same <br>
 time, since the size of the land claim <br>
 is the basis of the "evils" of gov't.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't find the argument convincing that because we can't trace a </i><br>
<i>&gt; clear title to 5% of the world's property that gives government the </i><br>
<i>&gt; right to control 100% of it. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: But still someone has to be given title <br>
 the to land, and it most logically defaults <br>
 to the longest running claim, since it pre-<br>
 existed most lives, current and historic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Their natural law case for ownership of the disputed </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5% is no stronger than my own...</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Yes it is, if their claim preexisted yours.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, the American government did steal the land fair and </i><br>
<i>&gt;square from the English, who stole it from the French and Spanish, who </i><br>
<i>&gt;stole it from Indian tribes, who stole it from other Indian tribes. </i><br>
<p>
  IAN: Exactly, but practicality dictates that<br>
  for reasons of not fighting wars over land and<br>
  getting on with consumer commerce that we fix <br>
  it with A claim, and the current gov't is the<br>
  longest running and looks like best candidate<br>
  on the block.  Of course, I think this land-<br>
  lord should be about 99% absentee, maximizing<br>
  individual liberty. Like Hong Kong was... <br>
  Hong Kong with a dash of Holland.<br>
<p>
  I'm just countering 100% anarchy. Minarchy.<br>
