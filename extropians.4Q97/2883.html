<i>&gt;&gt;The interesting question is "Why are Linux and GNU so successful, given</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;*enjoy* writing good software.  An important practical factor in this</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;out".  So things get done slowly, but they get done *right*, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;get it done right *the first time*, usually.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyone who thinks freeware gets done slower should compare the</i><br>
<i>&gt;speed of bug fixes.</i><br>
<p>
Bug fixes certainly come out faster with Linux than with commercial<br>
software.  I'm talking about development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eric Raymond has a much better explanation for the success of Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;style software in his "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" paper at:</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html">http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; His main point is that debugging can be effectively parallelized with</i><br>
<i>&gt;much greater brainpower when the source is freely shared.</i><br>
<p>
Certainly this is important, but it's not enough.  You can throw as<br>
many people as you want at a project, but if their *hearts* are not in<br>
it, the product will not be as good as software written by people with<br>
their heart in it.  Furthermore, the people that tend to work on<br>
freeware like Linux tend to be "Guru" types --- the kind of people who<br>
are better programmers than average.  Why are they better?  Because<br>
they're the type of people who spend their spare time programming,<br>
because they enjoy it.  Their driving force is coming from an inner<br>
need to produce something beautiful (yes, computer programs can be<br>
beautiful).  In a way, the Linux kernel is a work of art, produced by<br>
some of the best programming artists that Earth has to offer, all in<br>
their spare time, all directly out of their hearts.  When a bug<br>
appears, it gets fixed quickly precisely *because* the artists suddenly<br>
feel a pang of ugliness, and are compelled to fix it in order to<br>
restore beauty.  When you get hundreds of artists together doing this<br>
(here's where Eric's idea of parallelism comes in), you can get<br>
pretty spectacular results.<br>
<p>
Compare this to a software company with hundreds of programmers.  There<br>
is *always* "dead wood" in a commercial product of this size.  That is,<br>
people who are there solely because they need the money, not because<br>
they *want* to be there.  These people can be non-productive, or worse,<br>
can hinder the project as they produce code that is incomplete, buggy,<br>
or interacts badly with other sections of the code.  They simply are<br>
not capable of going at it with their entire heart and soul like<br>
freeware programmers do.  The result is shoddy software.<br>
<p>
Another point: imagine the things of beauty you would produce if you<br>
only worked on them when you felt like it.  If you get bored, you stop<br>
and do something else.  You *only* work on the project when you feel<br>
like it; when you have a positive mind-set about doing it.  That's what<br>
happens with Linux.  People working on something only when they want<br>
to, as compared to people trudging into work every Monday morning and<br>
starting to work when they really should still be home in bed.<br>
<p>
I know it sounds wishy-washy, but "having your heart in it" is<br>
something that is too often neglected today.  Imagine, for example,<br>
what this e-mail list would be like if instead of being *us*, it was a<br>
bunch of people who were *paid* to argue the points we debate here, who<br>
stopped arguing at lunch time and at 5pm, went home and watched TV all<br>
night without ever thinking about the issues again until 9am the next<br>
morning.  Do you think the debate would be as interesting?<br>
