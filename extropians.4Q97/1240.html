I've been remaining quiet with respect to the 'Big Bang' thread, for<br>
reasons I explain more fully below.  However, the use of my name in vain by<br>
Mr. Hollick has induced me to write this message.<br>

There's two plausible referents for 'Feynman' in this sentence.  One of<br>
them is me, Carl Feynman, and the other is my father, Richard Feynman.  I<br>
can assure you that neither of us understands your cockamamie renunciation<br>
of twenetieth-century physics.  Well, my father might understand it, but he<br>
certainly doesn't agree with it.  Here's a quote from 'The Feynman Lectures<br>
on Physics' (v3, ch1, p 10), discussing the notion that you might be able<br>
to explain quantum phenomena by having classical particles with internal<br>
state like your 'tiny rotating electric dipoles':<br>
<p>
[Feynman has just described the oddities of quantum interference.]  We make<br>
now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to<br>
avoid the description we have given: "Perhaps the electron has some kind of<br>
internal works-- some inner variables-- that we do not yet know about.<br>
Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what would happen.  If we could look<br>
more closely at the electron, we would be able to tell where it would end<br>
up."  So far as we know, that is impossible.  We would still be in<br>
difficulty.  [He goes on to describe why these models don't work.]<br>
<p>
I'm not going to bother transcribing the rest of the paragraph.  That's<br>
because I am assuming that (a) the vast majority of people on this list do<br>
not agree with you, and (b) you will never change your mind, no matter how<br>
hard anyone tries.  On what grounds do I assume (b)?  I don't know you<br>
personally, but I've seen the work of lots of people who have, like you,<br>
come up with a complete reconstruction of physics according to radical new<br>
principles.  My father would get letters and phone calls from them<br>
periodically, and occasional unwelcome visits.  Like you, they don't like<br>
Einstein.  Like you, they don't know much mathematics, but they do erect<br>
complex systems of important-sounding concepts.  Like you, they argue<br>
indefatigably and according to rules unlike those used by ordinary<br>
physicists, or, indeed, ordinary rational people.  Like you, they feel<br>
oppressed, abused and neglected by the world at large.  And it is generally<br>
impossible to change their mind, which certainly seems true of you so far.<br>
My father was careful to distinguish such people from genuine seekers after<br>
knowledge; to the latter, he would provide careful replies to their<br>
letters, and would spend considerable time on the phone with them.  To the<br>
former, he would not reply, having learned from experience  that any<br>
attempt at correspondence generally results in an interminable series of<br>
screeds of steadily increasing vituperation.  I have followed this<br>
principle on this list, and hence have not replied to any of your posts<br>
since you joined the list, no matter how obviously fallacious.    <br>
<p>
You are free to accuse me of closed-mindedness, rudeness, stupidity, or<br>
adherence to any number of unsound philosophical practices.  I doubt I will<br>
comment further on this matter.<br>
<p>

PS. And, while we're at it, my father thought Einstein was right about the<br>
peculiar way velocities add, which would imply he would disagree with you<br>
on that matter also.<br>
