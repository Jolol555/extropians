Actually, you can tell these luddites are scum even without knowing<br>
too much about their background and general history, methinks.<br>
The genlabs simply need better protection, like guards that hit first<br>
and ask questions later, or some vicious dogs. An automated perimeter<br>
defense with squirtguns that fire a disgustingly smelling green goo that<br>
will stick to the skin for weeks would be nice too. Poetic justice:<br>
luddites<br>
defeated by advanced technology. Of course abortion clinics could use<br>
some kind of advanced defenses too, so that gun-wielding religious fanatics<br>
can be dealt with swiftly and severely. It would be a worthy <br>
extropian goal to help develop better (automated) defensive systems/<br>
strategies for such vital institutions. Beats reading books IMO :)<br>
