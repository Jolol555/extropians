The future is built upon the past. Adapting to changing conditions doesn't<br>
necessarily mean throwing away *all* past successful traits.<br>

<i>&gt;For example, throughout most of human evolution, food was scarce, so</i><br>

<p>
Whence your goals of health and long life? If you dig deep enough, you'll<br>
find an instinct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Greg's "natural values" of life and society are more rooted in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;present reality, but that too is not the time frame I want to look</i><br>
<i>&gt;at: I want values to be teleological, to tell me how to make my</i><br>
<i>&gt;future different from my present.  True, I must reason from those</i><br>
<i>&gt;teleological premises and my knowledge of reality /now/ to derive</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational actions, but still the nature of reality now is no guide</i><br>
<i>&gt;to making those moral choices.</i><br>
<p>
Rational actions must have goals. If we acknowledge that objective morality<br>
is individual, not universal, and rooted in instinct, we can examine Greg's<br>
concept of heirarchy of objective moral goals to determine how we may adapt<br>
our individual goals to future conditions. And in the process resolve<br>
internal conflicts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Max's "rational values" aren't very satisfying either, because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are still derived from underlying chosen values, but there is a sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;in which they are valuable: simplicity.  Once someone goes through</i><br>
<i>&gt;the task of showing that some derived value--say, wealth--follows</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a core value of life, one can then use the derived value itself</i><br>
<i>&gt;in making decisions without having to re-derive it every time.  Much</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way a Mathematician would use a finished proof as a premise for</i><br>
<i>&gt;more complex proofs, or the way a programmer would use completed</i><br>
<i>&gt;subroutines to build more complex programs.  It is not even necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;that one know the derivation itself; in fact not spending the time</i><br>
<i>&gt;to go through every such derivation would be advantageous--an example</i><br>
<i>&gt;of what Friedman calls "rational ignorance", where the cost of a piece</i><br>
<i>&gt;of knowledge exceeds its value.</i><br>
<p>
Whence the core values of life? If you dig deep enough, you'll find an instinct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The game-theory arguments fail to get us out of our dilemma as well,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because they are founded on the assumption of measurable payoffs, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;are arbitrary. "Find positive-sum games" is of little use to someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;who has chosen values that prevent it.  Or for some, leads to completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;different results than we would prefer (for example, if you choose to</i><br>
<i>&gt;value the failure of others twice as much as they devalue it, then every</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction in which you victimize someone is positive-sum to you, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;every cooperation is zero-sum).</i><br>
<p>
Whence the desire not to victimize?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where I depart from Mr. England is that while we agree that we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationaly derive moral values, he then tries to derive moral values</i><br>
<i>&gt;from that failure--even more irrational.  He says, in effect, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;since your morals cannot be rational, be less judgmental of others</i><br>
<i>&gt;and less committed to your own.  I say choose one and get on with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have no problem committing my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the values I have chosen; it is precisely that commitment, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe, that enables me to accomplish the the things I want.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;since I need the cooperation of others to accomplish them, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt;work to spread those values in others, and judge them without apology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I just refuse to claim any objective basis for them, because honesty</i><br>
<i>&gt;is one of those core values I have chosen.</i><br>
<p>
Whence the core value of honesty?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant to everyday use.  Since 90% of the actions of humans are</i><br>
<i>&gt;demonstrably irrational based on their own expressed values, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;more to be accomplished by solving /that/ problem than by worrying</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the derivation of those values.  The latter can be dealt with</i><br>
<i>&gt;in places like this list; the rest of life can deal with the former.</i><br>
<p>
The is/ought gap needs only one bridge. From this single thread can be woven<br>
the very fabric of all human action and interaction, past, present, and future.<br>
