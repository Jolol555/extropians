Language in general does not efficiently encode emotional states or<br>
spatial/temporal relations.  Just for fun, ask someone to describe a<br>
spiral staircase.  It seems impossible to do this in casual speech without<br>
making a spiraling motion with the hands.<br>

Language, as great as it is, is not a perfect communication technology.<br>
We think lots of things we can't express in normal language; that's why we<br>
also use mathematics, music, visual arts, body language...<br>
<p>
A superior form of language, one which does all that modern human language<br>
does as well as efficiently describes spatial/temporal relationships,<br>
emotional states, etc., would necessitate an evolutionary change.  A<br>
language which does not conform to Universal Grammar and the proposed,<br>
concomitant Universal Semantics would _not_ be comprehensible to us right<br>
now.<br>

Consider apes who have been taught some sign language.  They can use<br>
words, which is no mean achievment, but they cannot use syntax; it is a<br>
system which they are cognitively unable to process.  Consequently while<br>
a signing ape can understand a biologist signing "eat banana?", they are<br>
incapable of understanding the difference between "You eat the banana" and<br>
"The banana eats you" which is entirely a syntactic distinction.  This is<br>
demonstrated by signing apes' strings of words, along the lines of "me eat<br>
eat eat me eat me me eat".<br>
<p>
The stages of child language acquisition give us an idea of the previous<br>
evolutionary stages of human language.  First, single words: "cat" "doggy"<br>
"milk" (actually this comes after non-linguistic babbling and then<br>
babbling using the phonemes of the child's linguistic environment,<br>
including hand gestures for babies around signing parents, but anyway.)<br>
Then come two word utterences, at which point the child already<br>
demonstrates a basic sensitivity to syntax.  Then comes the "telegraphic"<br>
stage: "Kitty come table?" "We go home." "Look pretty bird!"  Both these<br>
stages show a prefered word order (used something like 80-90% of the time,<br>
even in languages with flexible word order like Russian).  The vocabulary<br>
grows fairly steadily through these stages, slowly enough to keep a fairly<br>
accurate count of the words the child uses.  THEN comes the explosion:<br>
the child starts using full sentences and demonstrates a vocabulary too<br>
large to be counted easily.<br>
<p>
At each of these stages, children seem to be able to understand one degree<br>
of complexity greater than they can produce.  This gives me the idea that<br>
the next stage of linguistic evolution is something adult humans may be<br>
able to understand but not employ themselves.<br>
<p>
Hey, come to think of it, this is already the case.  I can understand<br>
Shakespeare, but I seriously doubt I could produce language of the same<br>
level.  Great writers encode thoughts more efficiently than can non-great<br>
writers.<br>
