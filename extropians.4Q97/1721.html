<i>&gt; I've found a few octopodes (allegedly, the correct plural of "octopus")</i><br>
<i>&gt; pages that might get all of us up to speed on this issue.  These are:</i><br>
<p>
The following is assuming that current scientific <br>
usage is consistent with Latin, rather than merely based on it... <br>
which is quite an assumption...<br>
<p>
The plural of "octopus" is "octopi".  <br>
<p>
"Octopodes" is the proper plural of "octopod" which means "eight <br>
feet" (in terms of appendages, not distance).  An octopus is indeed <br>
an octopod.  So is a squid, or a crab, or a lobster, or a spider, or <br>
a daddy-long-legs (which isn't a spider), or a scorpion if I remember <br>
right.  Among others.<br>
<p>
Of all these, I think that octopi are the only short-term viable <br>
candidates for uplift, and at least in the case of the Pacific giant, <br>
may already be uplifted without human intervention.<br>
<p>
By the way, I've heard it plausibly suggested that octopi don't <br>
really need to be constantly immersed in water to do well.  They do <br>
require high humidity, and they do require near-neutral bouyancy with <br>
regard to the space around them.  And gills out of water usually <br>
don't work well, so they may need some help with respiration.  But <br>
high humidity we can do in air, and near-neutral bouyancy is readily <br>
achievable in space.<br>
<p>
And, given comparable brain power, I would expect octopi <br>
to be better (or at least have a stronger aptitude) than humans at <br>
three-dimensional navigation.<br>
