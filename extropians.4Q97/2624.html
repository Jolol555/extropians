    Yeah I know it was, but still I hope you got my point. Like I said, I know we can't<br>
just get rid of guns all together, but my point was, none of that would have been<br>
possible if the gun didn't even exist.  I'm not saying put a stop to guns, if it wa<br>
possible, sure, I'd be fore it, but I know it's not.  I just like to defend the other<br>
side.  I don't like to see gun owners saying there's nothing wrong with guns, because<br>
there is, end of story.  And ya, I've prolly said close to all I want to about this<br>
subject, I'd rather get on something interesting to pool my thoght with on someone,<br>
rather than debate and separate it. Peace man.<br>
