Looks like they have found a way to mass produce them. Sorry for<br>

Transistor Technology Takes a<br>
                     Quantum Leap<br>
                     by Ilan Greenberg <br>
<p>
                     4:58am  8.Dec.97.PST<br>
                     Isaac Newton wouldn't approve of what Sandia<br>
                     National Laboratories is doing to the tried-and-true<br>
                     transistor. <br>
<p>
                     Conventional transistors are based on classical<br>
                     physics principles, but basic science researchers<br>
                     at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico,<br>
                     recently demonstrated a new transistor that<br>
                     makes use of quantum theory - specifically, it<br>
                     uses a technique called quantum mechanical<br>
                     tunneling of electrons. <br>
<p>
                     "It's pretty hard to make high-frequency<br>
                     transistors. This is true even after the federal<br>
                     government has pumped millions into funding<br>
                     university research. So considering that context,<br>
                     we're pretty happy with our results," says Jerry<br>
                     Simmons, head of the nanoelectronics group at<br>
                     Sandia. <br>
<p>
                     Called the Double Electron Layer Tunneling<br>
                     Transistor, or DELTT, the three-terminal quantum<br>
                     transistor is considered a breakthrough in<br>
                     transistor design because quantum tunneling<br>
                     leapfrogs current transistor technology in terms of<br>
                     its extremely high speed. The transistor will be<br>
                     capable of blistering speeds by relying on a single<br>
                     quantum transition between two electron states,<br>
                     something traditional transistors are unable to do. <br>
<p>
                     Quantum tunneling can also allow the same<br>
                     integrated circuit functions to be achieved with far<br>
                     fewer transistors. And because the transistor only<br>
                     needs existing nanotechnology to build its<br>
                     atomically precise two-dimensional layers of<br>
                     electrons - a new level of miniaturization for<br>
                     transistors - the DELTT is expected one day to be<br>
                     reliably manufactured in large numbers using<br>
                     existing semiconductor production facilities, a<br>
                     challenge long thought to be a limitation with<br>
                     quantum transistor design. Manufacturing the<br>
                     quantum transistor is years in the future, however. <br>
<p>
                     "Right now it's a research device. We've only<br>
                     demonstrated it in the past year," says Simmons.<br>
                     "I don't want to get in there worrying about<br>
                     production yield - it's my function to demonstrate<br>
                     that it's worthwhile to move it into the next stage." <br>
<p>
                     Simmons expects the device to work at room<br>
                     temperature by the end of next year, but even then<br>
                     it may be several more years before the<br>
                     technology is ready for production. "A real chip<br>
                     needs a million working transistors, and thus<br>
                     extremely high yields. We're on our way, but there<br>
                     still are obstacles to commercialization, and I<br>
                     can't say when it will actually be manufactured,"<br>
                     he says. <br>
<p>
                     Regardless of its manufacturing timeline,<br>
                     transistor researchers who have examined the<br>
                     fundamental research behind the chip say Sandia<br>
                     has produced a major advance in electronic<br>
                     design. <br>
<p>
                     "This is a premier piece of research," says Paul<br>
                     Berger, associate professor of electrical and<br>
                     computer engineering at the University of<br>
                     Delaware. "I've seen some of these things before,<br>
                     but nothing with this kind of complexity and<br>
                     sophistication. We're going to have to look for<br>
                     alternative ways of computation, and this quantum<br>
                     transistor is certainly noteworthy and needs to be<br>
                     addressed." <br>
<p>
                     Future applications for the quantum transistor<br>
                     include cellular phones and eventually desktop<br>
                     CPUs, Simmons says. Ultimately, Simmons<br>
                     hopes the transistor will find itself in three broad<br>
                     categories of devices: ultra-low-power static<br>
                     memory elements, which will require exceptionally<br>
                     low currents; ultra-high-speed logical processing<br>
                     elements, which will require very small feature<br>
                     sizes and somewhat higher currents; and<br>
                     far-infrared detectors. <br>
<p>
                     Sandia's interest in transistor design is one part of<br>
                     the government laboratory's larger charter, which<br>
                     is to assure the safety, security, and reliability of<br>
                     nuclear weapons. As part of this mission, the<br>
                     7,500-person lab also conducts research into<br>
                     basic science. While at some point the quantum<br>
                     transistor is likely to find itself attached to a<br>
                     nuclear warhead, the national defense laboratories<br>
                     are also increasingly participating in technology<br>
                     transfer programs with civilian industries. <br>
<p>
                     The Sandia team will present their research<br>
                     advance at the International Electronic Devices<br>
                     Meeting in Washington, DC, on Monday, and will<br>
                     publish various aspects of their research in the<br>
                     upcoming issue of the journal Applied Physics<br>
                     Letters. <br>
