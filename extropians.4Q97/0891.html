As an aside about the "allowing external posters"<br>
thread: I'm not subscribed to this list, because I<br>
can't afford the time to recieve 50 messages a day. <br>
However, I occasionally visit the web site and<br>
respond to posts that way.  If you only allowed posts<br>
by approved members of the list, I wouldn't be able<br>
to do that. Perhaps there should be a list of<br>
"allowed posters", separate from (and presumably a<br>
superset of) the list of recipients.<br>
<p>
RedHat has solved it this way:<br>
2.  New Items<br>
You can now subscribe to a special place that will<br>
allow you to post to any of the Red Hat mailing<br>
lists, but you will not receive any mail.  This is<br>
for folks who read our mailing lists via local<br>
special gateways and such.  If you don't understand<br>
this or why you would need it, you probably don't<br>
need it at all.  See the ``post-only'' list<br>
instructions below if you'd like to subscribe to it.<br>
Yes, the ``post-only'' idea does make it easier for<br>
spammers to spam all our lists, but it does have a<br>
subscription confirmation mechanism on it so we<br>
should be able to track attempts at such activity.<br>
o  post-only<br>
This ``list'' is a fake list.  It has no posting<br>
address, only a request address<br>
(post-only-request@redhat.com).  You can subscribe<br>
to this list and then you will be allowed to post to<br>
any of the RedHat mailing lists without receiving any<br>
mail from those lists. This is because we do not<br>
allow posts from folks who aren't subscribed to the<br>
list, but frequently people want to read the list via<br>
local gateways and so forth and don't need to subscribe<br>
themselves.  This way you just subscribe to<br>
`post-only'' and you are allowed to post to any list.<br>
