Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt; said:<br>
<p>
Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology<br>
in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller<br>
indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage<br>
can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of<br>
the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies<br>
will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there<br>
is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.<br>

Relevant to this topic there is a recent article at Cnet entitled:<br>
"Moore says Moore's Law to hit wall"<br>

An excerpt:<br>
Moore's Law is coming into direct conflict with the law of nature. So says <br>
Gordon Moore. <br>
<p>
Intel's chairman emeritus told an audience at the Intel Developer Forum <br>
today that the industry's ability to shrink a microprocessor through <br>
improved manufacturing processes is going to start butting up against <br>
the finite size of atomic particles. Barring a radical shift in <br>
microprocessor science, this means that the ability of the industry <br>
to double the computing power of a chip every 18 months (known as <br>
Moore's Law) may slow. <br>
<p>
Moore in fact showed an electromagnetic image of a microprocessor <br>
made under Intel's currently cutting-edge ".25 micron" chip production <br>
technology, in which the individual atomic layers could be counted and <br>
identified. <br>
<p>
Some time in the next several years we get to some finite limits, <br>
but not before we get through five generations," Moore said. According <br>
to one study, the physical limitations could be reached by 2017. <br>
<p>
"That's well beyond my shift," he quipped. "So someone else can do it." <br>
<p>
End excerpt. The rest of the article is available at:<br>
<a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0</a>,4,14751,00.html<br>
<p>
The end of Moore's law has been predicted multiple times by individuals<br>
involved in manufacturing . However, advances in materials and processes<br>
have kept occurring to keep Moore's law roughly on track.<br>
<p>
Building structures at the atomic level certainly seems to depend on<br>
primarily bottom-up procedures instead of top-down lithographic<br>
procedures.  Perhaps one could use a hybrid approach based on<br>
self-assembly of molecular subunits guided by larger lithographically<br>
built structures, or maybe molecular nanotechnology will mature. <br>
