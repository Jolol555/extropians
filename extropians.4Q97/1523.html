Bill would never steal somebody's kidneys. He's not that kind of guy.<br>
Buying the water company, and them selling everyone who wants to drink the<br>
water a mandatory kidney 'Upgrades' is more his style ;-)<br>

Since I started this I'll finish it (not that I expect to reach agreement<br>
but just to clarify why I feel the way I do). If you don't believe me, well<br>
that's too bad but not a complete disaster, maybe these people have some<br>
credibility?<br>

Depending on a single company for all future OS<br>
innovation and on another for all future CPU<br>
innovation would be tragic for an industry<br>
driven by technology.<br>
-- Tom R. Halfhill, Sr. Editor, BYTE Mag.<br>
<p>
<p>
If one company dominates everything, it's<br>
dangerous. You kill innovation and you lose<br>
the capacity to create alternatives. Ultimately,<br>
that isn't good for the consumer or the country.<br>

The reason we come up with new versions is not<br>
to fix bugs. It's absolutely not. It's the<br>
stupidest reason to buy a new version I ever heard.<br>
-- Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft Corporation<br>
<p>
<p>
In a manner that would have left the robber barons<br>
of the late 19th century gaping in absolute awe,<br>
Microsoft is approaching something unprecedented:<br>
a monopoly that could well own the choke points of<br>
tomorrow's commerce and communications.<br>

When people understand what Microsoft is up to,<br>
they're outraged.<br>

I'm not one of those who think Bill Gates is the<br>
devil. I simply suspect that if Microsoft ever met<br>
up with the devil, it wouldn't need an interpreter.<br>

If this isn't technical enough for your taste check the open letter to MS<br>
that was sent in the OpenGL API debate last summer, I'm not a programmer<br>
but on this list you'll find over *1400* people who are, among them are<br>
some of the top game developers in the world, I'd sooner believe them than<br>

But maybe these people are all incredebly naive and don't understand IT at<br>
all ;-). Sort of like us poor IBM-ers. Why is it that every time M$ outfits<br>
a company with NT they come to IBM (or another IT consultant company) for<br>
help with their suddenly HUGE security and systems-management problems? Why<br>
is it that it takes three times as long to get Systems Management software<br>
working in an NT Client-Server (if_you_insist_on_calling_it_that)<br>
environment?.<br>
<p>
Isn't the fact that there are lot's of anti-MS sites around saying something?<br>
I've never come accross an anti-IBM site (Or HP, Apple, SGI, SUN, Corel....).<br>
But if anyone can locate one I'll be most interested in it's content.<br>
