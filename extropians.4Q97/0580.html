 <br>
  If you'd like a summary introduction to Kant's work, here is Britannica's:<br>
<p>
  (Alas, Ayn Rand (so good on many issues) got Kant all wrong; does <br>
  anyone know if she ever encountered Karl Popper's -- vastly more <br>
  poweful -- _Critical Rational_ Objectivist philosophy? -- TH).<br>
 <br>
      Kant<br>
      ==== <br>
 <br>
 "* Sapere Aude! *  Dare to use your own intelligence!  This is the <br>
 maxim of the Enlightenment!"  [From 'Was ist Aufklarung?' (What is <br>
 Enlightenment?) -- Immanuel Kant].<br>
<p>
 <br>
 "Interestingly,  Kant (1724-1804) acknowledged that he had despised <br>
 the ignorant masses until he read Rousseau and came to appreciate the <br>
 worth that exists in every human being. For other reasons too, Kant <br>
 is part of the tradition deriving from both Spinoza and Rousseau. <br>
 Like his predecessors, Kant insisted that actions resulting from <br>
 desires cannot be free.<br>
 <br>
 Freedom is to be found only in rational action. Moreover, whatever is <br>
 demanded by reason must be demanded of all rational beings; hence, <br>
 rational action cannot be based on a single individual's personal <br>
 desires, but must be action in accordance with something that he can <br>
 will to be a universal law. This view roughly parallels Rousseau's <br>
 idea of the general will as that which, as opposed to the individual <br>
 will, a person shares with the whole community. Kant extended this <br>
 community to all rational beings.<br>
 <br>
 Kant's most distinctive contribution to ethics was his insistence <br>
 that our actions possess moral worth only when we do our duty for <br>
 its own sake. He first introduced this idea as something accepted by <br>
 our common moral consciousness and only then tried to show that it is <br>
 an essential element of any rational morality. In claiming that this <br>
 idea is central to the common moral consciousness, Kant was <br>
 expressing in heightened form a tendency of Judeo-Christian ethics <br>
 and revealing how much the Western ethical consciousness had changed <br>
 since the time of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.<br>
 <br>
 Does our common moral consciousness really insist that there is no <br>
 moral worth in any action done for any motive other than duty? <br>
 Certainly we would be less inclined to praise the young man who <br>
 plunges into the surf to rescue a drowning child if we learned that <br>
 he did it because he expected a handsome reward from the child's <br>
 millionaire father. This feeling lies behind Kant's disagreement with <br>
 all those moral philosophers who have argued that we should do what <br>
 is right because that is the path to happiness, either on earth or in <br>
 heaven. <br>
 <br>
 But Kant went further than this. He was equally opposed to those who <br>
 see benevolent or sympathetic feelings as the basis of morality. Here <br>
 he may be reflecting the moral consciousness of 18th-century <br>
 Protestant Germany, but it appears that even then the moral <br>
 consciousness of Britain, as reflected in the writings of <br>
 Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Butler, and Hume, was very different. The <br>
 moral consciousness of Western civilization in the last quarter of <br>
 the 20th century also appears to be different from the one Kant was <br>
 describing.<br>
 <br>
 Kant's ethics is based on his distinction between  hypothetical and <br>
 categorical imperatives. He called any action based on  desires a <br>
 hypothetical imperative, meaning by this that it is a command of <br>
 reason that applies only if we desire the goal. For example, "Be <br>
 honest, so that people will think well of you!" is an imperative that <br>
 applies only if you want people to think well of you. A similarly <br>
 hypothetical analysis can be given of the imperatives suggested by, <br>
 say, Shaftesbury's ethics: "Help those in distress, if you sympathize <br>
 with their sufferings!" <br>
 <br>
 In contrast to such approaches to ethics, Kant said that the commands <br>
 of morality must be categorical imperatives: they must apply to all <br>
 rational beings, regardless of their wants and feelings. To most <br>
 philosophers this poses an insuperable problem: a moral law that <br>
 applied to all rational beings, irrespective of their personal wants <br>
 and desires, could have no specific goals or aims because all such <br>
 aims would have to be based on someone's wants or desires.<br>
 <br>
 It took Kant's peculiar genius to seize upon precisely this <br>
 implication, which to others would have refuted his claims, and to <br>
 use it to derive the nature of the moral law. Because nothing else <br>
 but reason is left to determine the content of the moral law, the <br>
 only form this law can take is the universal principle of reason. <br>
 Thus the supreme formal principle of Kant's ethics is: "Act only on <br>
 that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should <br>
 become a universal law."<br>
 <br>
 Kant still faced two major problems. First, he had to explain how we <br>
 can be moved by reason alone to act in accordance with this supreme <br>
 moral law; and, second, he had to show that this principle is able to <br>
 provide practical guidance in our choices. If we were to couple <br>
 Hume's theory that reason is always the slave of the passions with <br>
 Kant's denial of moral worth to all actions motivated by desires, the <br>
 outcome would be that no actions can have moral worth. <br>
 <br>
 To avoid such moral skepticism, Kant maintained that reason alone can <br>
 lead to action. Unfortunately he was unable to say much in defense of <br>
 this claim. Of course, the mere fact that we otherwise face so <br>
 unpalatable a conclusion is in itself a powerful incentive to believe <br>
 that somehow a categorical imperative must be possible, but this is <br>
 not convincing to anyone not already wedded to Kant's view of moral <br>
 worth. <br>
 <br>
 At one point Kant appeared to be taking a different line. He wrote <br>
 that the moral law inevitably produces in us a feeling of reverence <br>
 or awe. If he meant to say that this feeling then becomes the <br>
 motivation for obedience, however, he was conceding Hume's point that <br>
 reason alone is powerless to bring about action. It would also be <br>
 difficult to accept that anything, even the moral law, can <br>
 necessarily produce a certain kind of feeling in all rational beings <br>
 regardless of their psychological constitution. Thus this approach <br>
 does not succeed in clarifying Kant's position or rendering it <br>
 plausible.<br>
 <br>
 Kant gave closer attention to the problem of how his supreme formal <br>
 principle of morality can provide guidance in concrete situations. <br>
 One of his examples is as follows. Suppose that I plan to get some <br>
 money by promising to pay it back, although I have no intention of <br>
 keeping my promise. The maxim of such an action might be "Make false <br>
 promises when it suits you to do so." Could such a maxim be a <br>
 universal law? Of course not. If promises were so easily broken, no <br>
 one would rely on them, and the practice of promising would cease. <br>
 For this reason, I know that the moral law does not allow me to carry <br>
 out my plan.<br>
 <br>
 Not all situations are so easily decided. Another of Kant's examples <br>
 deals with aiding those in distress. I see someone in distress, whom <br>
 I could easily help, but I prefer not to do so. Can I will as a <br>
 universal law the maxim that a person should refuse assistance to <br>
 those in distress? Unlike the case of promising, there is no strict <br>
 inconsistency in this maxim being a universal law. <br>
 <br>
 Kant, however, says that I cannot will it to be such because I may <br>
 someday be in distress myself, and I would then want assistance from <br>
 others. This type of example is less convincing than the previous <br>
 one. If I value self-sufficiency so highly that I would rather remain <br>
 in distress than escape from it through the intervention of another, <br>
 Kant's principle no longer tells me that I have a duty to assist <br>
 those in distress. <br>
 <br>
 In effect, Kant's supreme principle of practical reason can only tell <br>
 us what to do in those special cases in which turning the maxim of <br>
 our action into a universal law yields a contradiction. Outside this <br>
 limited range, the moral law that was to apply to all rational beings <br>
 regardless of their wants and desires cannot guide us except by <br>
 appealing to our desires.<br>
 <br>
 Kant does offer alternative formulations of the categorical <br>
 imperative, and one of these has been seen as providing more <br>
 substantial guidance than the formulation so far considered. This <br>
 formulation is: "So act that you treat humanity in your own person <br>
 and in the person of everyone else always at the same time as an end <br>
 and never merely as means." <br>
 <br>
 The connection between this formulation and the first one is not <br>
 entirely clear, but the idea seems to be that when I choose for <br>
 myself I treat myself as an end. If, therefore, in accordance with <br>
 the principle of universal law, I must choose so that all could <br>
 choose similarly, I must respect everyone else as an end. Even if <br>
 this is valid, the application of the principle raises further <br>
 questions. <br>
 <br>
 What is it to treat someone merely as a means? Using a person as a  <br>
 slave is an obvious example; Kant, like Bentham, was making a stand <br>
 against this kind of inequality while it still flourished as an <br>
 institution in some parts of the world. But to condemn slavery we <br>
 have only to give equal weight to the interests of the slaves. Does <br>
 Kant's principle take us any further than Utilitarianism? Modern <br>
 Kantians hold that it does because they interpret it as denying the <br>
 legitimacy of sacrificing the rights of one human being in order to <br>
 benefit others.<br>
 <br>
 One thing that can be said confidently is that Kant was firmly <br>
 opposed to the Utilitarian principle of judging every action by its <br>
 consequences. His ethics is a deontology. In other words, the <br>
 rightness of an action depends on whether it accords with a rule <br>
 irrespective of its consequences. In one essay Kant went so far as to <br>
 say that it would be wrong to tell a lie even to a would-be murderer <br>
 who came to your door seeking to kill an innocent person hidden in <br>
 your house. <br>
 <br>
 This kind of situation illustrates how difficult it is to remain a <br>
 strict deontologist when principles may clash. Apparently Kant <br>
 believed that his principle of universal law required that one never <br>
 tell lies, but it could also be argued that his principle of treating <br>
 everyone as an end would necessitate doing everything possible to <br>
 save the life of an innocent person. Another possibility would be to <br>
 formulate the maxim of the action with sufficient precision to define <br>
 the circumstances under which it would be permissible to tell <br>
 lies--e.g., we could all agree to a universal law that permitted lies <br>
 to people intending to commit murder. <br>
 <br>
 Kant did not explore such solutions."<br>
