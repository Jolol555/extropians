I agree with you.  I used creatine for a number of months. During this time,<br>
I put on 8 lbs of body mass and maintained a stomach ache and slight nausea<br>
throughout the supplemental routine. (I don't know whether it was because of<br>
the creatine, or my commitment as an athlete.)  Now, I am not taking<br>
creatine.  My muscle mass has maintained.  I am just as strong and cut as<br>
while taking the creatine, if not stronger.<br>

The media tends to "pump-up" information and inaccurately exploit it without<br>
checking authenticity. <br>
