<i>&gt; it, the oil industry in the US receives tens of billions of dollars per</i><br>
<i>&gt; year in direct and indirect subsidies from the US taxpayer.  Here's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a quote from <a href="http://www.wallowa.com/kerr/kerr9.htm:">http://www.wallowa.com/kerr/kerr9.htm:</a></i><br>
<p>
GOvernment policies like those that supported the sustaining of Saddam<br>
Hussein's war against Iran. the US and Europe pumped billions of dollars<br>
of tax money into supporting Husseins war machine. The Iran/Iraq<br>
conflict in the Gulf kept oil transport and insurance costs high, and<br>
limited the amount of oil Iran and Iraq could supply to the world<br>
market. Our governments valued high oil prices more than the possibility<br>
that fundamentalists could take over Iraq and come within striking<br>
distance of Isreal for conventional weaponry. US and European support of<br>
Isreal is the cause of the original oil embargo, and our idiotic<br>
policies in Iran allowed a demagogue like Khomeni to take power there.<br>
<p>
It doesn't matter that we now have the lowest oil prices in the world. I<br>
don't see europeans spending even a double digit fraction of the hefty<br>
taxes they levy on oil and gas on energy conservation or emissions<br>
reduction. It funds their welfare states. I am comparing 70's and 80's<br>
oil prices to 60's oil prices. Oil was $4-$8 per bbl in the 60's. It<br>
went to $18-21 per bbl in 1973, and peaked at $32 per bbl in 1979. It<br>
slowly dropped, far slower than supply/demand would indicate, partly due<br>
to OPEC and partly due to oil companies and partly due to the US<br>
sustaining Hussien in his war with Iran.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; }Most industrialized nations heavily tax petroleum because government</i><br>
<i>&gt; }spend lots of money keeping the oil flowing and cleaning up the messes</i><br>
<i>&gt; }caused by oil. But not in the USA where income and property taxpayers</i><br>
<i>&gt; }pay through the nose since the tax on gasoline doesn't come close to</i><br>
<i>&gt; }covering the costs.</i><br>
<p>
We more than cover the costs. We build our entire highway system with<br>
them. Oil spills are paid for by the spiller. SUrely you remember the<br>
$30 billion bill passed to Exxon by the US gov't, the State of Alaska,<br>
and the local indians and fishermen for the Valdez spill??? One of the<br>
benefits of our highly litigious society.<br>
<p>
We in America have nowhere near the same level of socialist nightmare<br>
that high oiltax countries do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }The Institute for Local Self Reliance has issued "Oil Slickers: How</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Petroleum Benefits at the Taxpayer's Expense" (www.ilsr.com or $10</i><br>
<i>&gt; }from 1313 5th St. SE, Suite 306 Minneapolis, MN 55414), a compelling</i><br>
<i>&gt; }analysis of the hidden costs of oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Economists call them "externalities." They are costs that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; }reflected in the price of product. For example, all the damages caused</i><br>
<i>&gt; }by cigarettes isn't paid for by the tax on a pack of cigarettes.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, studies have shown that cigarette taxes do pay for the costs.<br>
States and the feds perfer to spend that money on other stuff and go<br>
back for another helping. The only externalities that fossil fuels do<br>
not pay for is the carbon emissions. I do support the enactment of a<br>
mechanism to include the costs in the marketplace, as the US is pushing<br>
in the Kyoto negotiations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }ISLR estimates that the additional costs in tax subsidies, military</i><br>
<i>&gt; }protection, and environmental and human health costs is between $42</i><br>
<i>&gt; }and $350 billion annually. (The range is so wide because it depends on</i><br>
<i>&gt; }what and how you count.) For perspective, the federal governments</i><br>
<i>&gt; }deficit this year is less than $200 billion.</i><br>
<p>
And where are the benefits counted???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }First is the $3.3 to $10.9 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; }They have convinced Congress to grant them a whole list of tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; }subsidies from the oil depletion allowance to accelerated depreciation</i><br>
<i>&gt; }and a bunch of other breaks given to no other industry. The statutory</i><br>
<i>&gt; }rate of taxation for American business is 35% before deductions. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; }oil companies pay about 11%. Most other industries are much closer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; }35%. Taxes that the oil companies don't pay means that other</i><br>
<i>&gt; }taxpayers---or our grandchildren in the form of debt---do pay.</i><br>
<p>
SOrry, the average tax rate for American corporations is about 14%.<br>
SOrry, this is the same old tax justification bullshit. That doesn't<br>
play on a Libertarian leaning mail list. Read the FAQ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }It's not just federal taxes that are being tapped to meet our</i><br>
<i>&gt; }petroleum addiction, but also local property taxes. ISLR estimated</i><br>
<i>&gt; }that if the transportation taxes paid it's full freight in</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Minneapolis, rather than some of the burden being paid by property</i><br>
<i>&gt; }taxes, gasoline would cost another 18 cents/gallon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Second, taxpayers spend $26.6 to $70.7 billion to pay for military</i><br>
<i>&gt; }protection in the Middle East and elsewhere. This figure is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; }dollars, not in American blood (and health) that was lost in Oil War I</i><br>
<i>&gt; }(you may remember it as the Gulf War) or could be lost in the upcoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Oil War II.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I don't think these figures are anywhere near accurate. The $60<br>
billion cost of the Gulf War was paid for by other countries, mostly<br>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, with the exception of only $5 billion.<br>
Additionally, the total US defense budget is only $240 billion,<br>
supporting over 1 million troops. We have less than 10,000 troops in the<br>
Gulf Region right now, so as a proportionate cost we are talking about<br>
$2.4 billion, though that could be as much as double due to higher costs<br>
for forward deployment. Not much more, I know from experience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }One Defense Department official recently told Congress that the last</i><br>
<i>&gt; }war in 1991 might keep things quiet for 10 years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; }</i><br>
<i>&gt; }Third, and the hardest to quantify precisely-but likely the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; }expensive of all-is the estimated $25.5 to $267 billion annual costs</i><br>
<i>&gt; }in the form of environmental and health costs associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; }pollution...</i><br>
<p>
How is it counted???? SOmebody is paying for it somewhere anyways, with<br>
the exception of the CO2 dumping, which is now being addressed in Kyoto.<br>
Whether its paid for directly or indirectly  is irrelevant. Considering<br>
that, according to the debate on this list, the stats show, at best,<br>
that absoluteley no change is taking place. Things are possibly cooling<br>
a bit more by  a half a degree per decade, or warmer by hald a degree<br>
per decade. As I stated in a previous post, since the average global<br>
warming at sea level is mostly because Northern Hemisphere cooling from<br>
sulfates levels reduction is slowing, global warming COULD be caused by<br>
us not polluting ENOUGH.... THink about that...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; He goes on to interpret this data in ways I don't agree with, but up</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this point his "facts" jive with what I've heard elsewhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In conclusion, Americans should be the last people on earth to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; complaining about the price of oil.  What you *should* be doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; is complaining about billions of your tax dollars subsidizing it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; price.</i><br>
<p>
Hey, I didnt' say anything about prices RIGHT NOW, did I??????? I Like<br>
them where they are, and think they possibly should have carbon taxes<br>
added if, and only if, global warming does indeed seem to be occuring in<br>
a way that we cannot fix any other way. I would prefer that rather than<br>
governments raking in tons of dough on carbon taxes, which they would<br>
most likely misappropriate, misspend, and waste away without<br>
accomplishing anything, that the fees be levied as part of a emissions<br>
trading market.<br>
