<i>&gt; &gt;The word Brian means is "statist".  However, the word in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;message he is responding to is "stasist".  Rather different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No the word Brian means is "stasist" , read the article...  ;)</i><br>

I didn't think you were confusing the terms stasist and statist myself,<br>
*however*, part of my objection to the Postrel article is that *she* seems<br>
to conflate the two herself.  She implies at the beginning of the essay<br>
that the metaphor of building a bridge to the future contains the implicit<br>
assumptions that there is one right future and that only a Big State is<br>
capable of building it.  I simply don't agree with this.  I think one can<br>
retain the belief in the desirability of the political process of getting<br>
people to work in concert to build a bridge to a better future without a<br>
coercive state to underwrite the project.  In fact, I suspect that without<br>
the foresight and effort of a little conscious bridge-building we won't<br>
arrive in a future we want in the first place.  Postrel's injunction<br>
seemed to me to be too "don't worry, be happy."  In fact, the overall<br>
spirit of the WIRED volume nudged in the same direction, despite its many<br>
delights. I refuse to be tarred with the brush of either statism *or*<br>
stasism just because I think it makes sense to think what we are doing. <br>
