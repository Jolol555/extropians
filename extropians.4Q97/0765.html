<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Libertarians seem to think that they have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an inherent right to property upon which a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The U.S. is not a person, and thus has no rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The population was here before the government was.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Consent is the highest form of acceptance. Think of acceptance as a scale,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with gun-to-the-head *submission* on one end, and yes-that's-what-I-want</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*consent* on the other end. When viewed in this manner, it is clear that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;obey-or-leave-the-country is closer, on the scale of acceptance, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;submission than it is to consent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;This brings up my major question about Libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;of two things would need to happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Not so. See below.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;But as long as there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;will always attempt to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Agreed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Libertarians unilaterally decide that aggression (initiation of force) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;immoral, while proportionate defense against aggression is moral. I call</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;this the Primethic Decision. This means that a libertarian will recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and respect everyone's right to consent (to that which would otherwise be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;aggression), but will consider it moral to defend themselves wrt those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;do not make the Primethic Decision, i.e. non-libertarians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Primethic Decision (that aggression is immoral and defense is moral)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;thus establishes the right to consent, which is the basis for all universal,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reciprocol rights. IOW, universal, reciprocol rights cannot exist without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;first recognizing the right to consent, which can only come from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Primethic Decision. All else is by consensual agreement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It is not necessary that all adhere. Those who do not, should they aggress</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;against others, are simply, and morally, defended against.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Can anyone talk me out of this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Does this help?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes!  Okay, this makes sense, thanks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The big question for me now is "If you divided the world into those willing</i><br>
to fight<br>
<i>&gt;for the spoils of fascism, and those willing to fight for unconstrained</i><br>
personal &gt;freedom,<br>
<i>&gt;who would win?"</i><br>
<p>
Less important: Define fascism. Exactly what are we fighting against? I<br>
would say aggression.<br>
<p>
Important: Define freedom. Exactly what are we fighting for? I would say the<br>
right to consent, or not consent, to that which would otherwise be<br>
aggression, i.e. our individual right to freely choose the rules by which we<br>
conduct our lives, so long as we are not aggressing against others.<br>
<p>
More important: Define fight. By what means, and in what sense are we<br>
fighting? Unless we have self-destructive tendencies, we fight in ways that<br>
are relatively safe, having the potential of relatively high reward at low risk.<br>
<p>
Most important: Define win. What, exactly, is the goal? I envision a society<br>
wherein communities are philosophical rather than geographical, and each<br>
individual is free to choose (and unchoose) between communities, or to<br>
choose no community. The sole purpose of any overall government would be to<br>
defend consensual rights.<br>
<p>
IMHO, we can only get there by a process of evolution. Violent revolution<br>
can only give us more of the same...or worse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One of Gardner Dozois (sp?) peerless "best sci-fi of the year" collections</i><br>
once had a &gt;story<br>
<i>&gt;where Gandhi attempted to help India resist Nazi Germany.  The outcome</i><br>
seemed to &gt;suggest<br>
<i>&gt;that the author believed most people will knuckle under rather than going</i><br>
to the wall &gt;for<br>
<i>&gt;personal freedoms.  </i><br>
<p>
The vast majority will always "go along to get along."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this is true, one person (or a small group) would need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of either resisting the imposed rule of a large number of people, </i><br>
<p>
Ultimately, dedicated aggressors are few, but highly organized. Dedicated<br>
defenders are even fewer, and highly disorganized. In between are those who<br>
aggress because to not do so would be somehow detrimental to them, and those<br>
who resist when it is relatively safe to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;or the &gt;cost/benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt;ratio of controlling that person would need to be too poor for the majority</i><br>
to bother &gt;(and<br>
<i>&gt;I think people like Newt generally feel "I don't care what the cost/benefit</i><br>
ratio is &gt;for<br>
<i>&gt;dominating that PARTICULAR person, since the benefit of creating a</i><br>
precedent is &gt;incalculable").<br>
<p>
Such dominance is unpersuasive, and therefore, tenuous. The real battle is<br>
for hearts and minds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How do others feel?  Is this inherently untrue?  Is one person's ability to</i><br>
fight the<br>
<i>&gt;establishment (or become invisible to the establishment) changing due to</i><br>
technology &gt;sufficiently<br>
<i>&gt;to escape this formula?</i><br>
<p>
If and when it becomes relatively safe to resist, the aggressor's house of<br>
cards comes tumbling down. <br>
