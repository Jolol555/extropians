I would like to point at Greg Egan's short story "The Extra",<br>
<a href="http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/issue_02/02_extra.htm">http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/issue_02/02_extra.htm</a><br>
apropos this subject. <br>

<i>&gt; Then again, the technology needed to perform a brain transplant</i><br>
<i>&gt; could probably also cure at least *some* of the (brain)diseases mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; above. Any doctor in the house to verify this?</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how it would help. Maybe it would be useful for people<br>
with cardiovascular problems, but the strain of the actual transplantation<br>
is likely large. Brain transplants might be useful for diseases of the <br>
rest of the body, but suitable diseases are getting less and less common. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Another downside is the need to wait 18</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to 20 odd years for any clone bodies grown _right now_ to reach any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reasonable form of physical maturity.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've once heard on some Discovery Channel program that you could</i><br>
<i>&gt; grow (human) tissues at an astronomical rate under the right conditions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A small patch of cells could fill the floor of a football stadium in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter of weeks or so, if cultivated under the right conditions. </i><br>
<i>&gt; At least _some_</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs could be grown in vitro on a skeleton of some kind of stuff that</i><br>
<i>&gt; dissolves with time, maybe even whole bodies. This would only take </i><br>
<i>&gt; a month or so(?).</i><br>
<p>
No. You are right in that cells can divide very quickly in culture,<br>
skin cells (which was likely what they discussed) breed like bacteria<br>
under the right circumstances. The problem is that they do not form<br>
differentiated tissue, just a thin layer of cells. What you would need<br>
is a way to get the tissue to differentiate into an useful organ or<br>
even a body, and that requires solving some rather tricky<br>
problems. Most of the structure is organized by interactions of<br>
diffusing morphogenic messenger molecules, activating or deactivating<br>
genetic switches. Their rate of diffusion is *crucial* for the correct<br>
organization, so you cannot speed up the formation of the body without<br>
speeding up *all* diffusion coefficients.  Tricky, very tricky,<br>
bordering on the physically unlikely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Talk about an industry, though-- the care and feeding of decerebrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clones.  How much per day do you figure it would cost to care for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; decerebrated clone?  To make sure it is properly fed by whatever &gt;means?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can't have a clone come out of the tank malnourished.  </i><br>
<p>
To develop the body fully, you need some activity in the physical<br>
world, not just a clone-tank. But to answer your question, it would<br>
likely be very, very expensive. Tissue engineering is likely the way<br>
to go, keeping spare clones around would be uneconomical.<br>
