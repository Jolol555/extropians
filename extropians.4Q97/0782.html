I am inclined toward a more orderly transistion, hence my three part<br>
transition plan:<br>
<p>
1. Allow 50% to repeal any laws or portions thereof.<br>
<p>
2. Automatically reduce the percentage required to repeal by 1% per year.<br>
<p>
3. Allow the majority (50%+1) to raise or lower the percentage required to<br>
repeal by up to, but no more than, 5% per year, and not to exceed 50%.<br>
<p>
The idea is to eventually find the optimum percentage, and thus achieve near<br>
unanimity.<br>
<p>
Most of us tend to overlook the importance of repeal. As I like to put it:<br>
No matter who makes the laws or how, if I had the exclusive power to repeal<br>
them, we would all be living in GarysWorld. :-)<br>
