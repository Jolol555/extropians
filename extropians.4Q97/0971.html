<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the improvements in health.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Many have said exercise is good </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;but never has it been explained to me in a convincing manner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;1-What are the health benifits besides strong hearts, lungs, and ankles</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;(weak ankles cause many falls which lead to complications due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;osteoporosis)?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Enhance immunity, enhanced intelligence and mental energy, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;increased GH, etc</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have been trying to weigh to benifits of intelligence vs. free-rad</i><br>
<i>&gt; production.</i><br>
<p>
These are almost orthogonal. They don't trade-off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose being stupid would kill me sooner.</i><br>
<p>
It certainly could.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Someday I'll ask someone to convince me exercise is good </i><br>
<i>&gt; and they will not only list what it does </i><br>
<i>&gt; they will say how it does it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aw who am I kidding. </i><br>
<p>
I think the mechanism of most of the benefits is reasonably well known,<br>
but I would take anywhere from a short mongraph to a long textbook to<br>
explain depending on how much you know to start with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; (just about every life enhancing factor you can think of - except</i><br>
<i>&gt; production</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of free radicals and some waste products, both of which are not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ie more than made up for by compensating enhancements, if the exercise</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not too extreme)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; after massive intestinal failure.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Medically, "Nutritional deficiency" has a very technical meaning. For</i><br>
<i>&gt; each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nutrient which is deemed essential, there is a specific deficency</i><br>
disease<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which happens when all others are adequate and only it is deficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is necessary that there be such a disease in order for a nutrient to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; called essential. The RDA is the amount which is necessary to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disease in most people.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Thus, it is likely that no one on parenteral feeding "technically" dies</i><br>
<i>&gt; of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nutrient deficiency since the diet ensures that they get all of the</i><br>
known<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; essential nutrients. The problem is that first there are likely still</i><br>
<i>&gt; some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unknown important nutrients</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We have STMs and unknown nutrients.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What are they... piconutrients?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe we need foods electromagnetic aura to sustain us.</i><br>
<p>
No, you miss the point. The number of possible chemicals (with very<br>
different properties) is higher than astromomical. Not all the chemicals<br>
in natural foods have even been isolated and even for many which have,<br>
their value or lack of it is not known. This is partly because not all<br>
the chemicals that our body uses and makes have been discovered yet.<br>
And certainly not all the biochemical pathways.<br>
<p>
I always maintain that one of the fundamental mistakes that extropians,<br>
transhumanists, nanotechnologists, uploaders, AI people, etc make is<br>
grossly underestimating human and brain complexity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;and the term essential as defined above is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; necessarily sufficient to keep one alive for very long.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;While I'm speaking of them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;3-Have any tests been done to estimate the average length of life </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;after specific nutrients are removed from the diet?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; For the technically essential nutrients, yes, these things are</i><br>
generally<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; known.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I searched and gave up after an hour or so.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know what you searched, but contrary to "net-hype" everything<br>
is not available on the Internet (yet).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I wonder how long it takes to die from each nutrient deficiency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;4-What phrases could I use for a medline search?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You might be better to begin with an advanced nutrition text such as</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; _Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism_ Groff, Gropper and Hunt</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Krause's _Food, Diet, and Nutrition Therapy_</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the</i><br>
<i>&gt; capillaries.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but you need to learn more physiology. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Whoops...plasma.</i><br>
<p>
That was the *least* important mistake.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The red blood cells have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nothing to do with nutrient distribution. In fact, more red blood cells</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might tend to make it worse, there is only so much blood volume</i><br>
<i>&gt; available.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; See Guyton's _A Textbook of Medical Physiology_ (a good book on the</i><br>
body<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; changes due to exercise also)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  How rapidly could I change red/white cell counts?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If it is controlable enough I could:</i><br>
<i>&gt; A)increase plasma during feeding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; B)increase red cell during exercise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; C)increase white cell during cleansing.</i><br>
<p>
a) For plasma volume increase give electrolytes plus colloid.<br>
   There are standard medical plasma expanders available.<br>
 <br>
b) For increase red blood cells take testosterone (a slow method)<br>
   or get a direct transfusion of compatible red cells<br>
   or drain you own blood and add plasma expander, this will lower<br>
   hematocrit and cause spleen to empty its red cell reservoir and<br>
   to manufacture more, then transfuse own blood back.<br>
   Walla! super high hematocrit!<br>
c) I can think of no way to do this at present except by infecting<br>
   yourself with many things which you have previously been vacinnated<br>
   against.<br>
<p>
The real question is why would you want to do any of these things?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;there are also increases in efficiency of temperature distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;preventing hyper/hypothermia, thus leading to decreased free-radical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;production from sweating/shivering.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Again you need to learn more physiology. The body is not warmed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooled</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as if some central heating system with the blood vessels taking the</i><br>
place<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of water or air condiuts. </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; As my pride is wounded from my apparent lack of physiological knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I will defend myself with my grasp of physics </i><br>
<i>&gt; which extends beyond my body into the hot, dry air </i><br>
<i>&gt; which fills my lungs at the center of my being, </i><br>
<i>&gt; warming my soul by reaching through it's bloody tendrils</i><br>
<i>&gt; (rather much like a central heating system).:-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am sorry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alas, I could not resist.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The temperature regulation is done directly by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; each cell in response to thyroid hormones and others information</i><br>
<i>&gt; transmitters</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all the blood does is even out the temperature from one spot to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So you are correct that more blood volume could aid in preventing "hot</i><br>
<i>&gt; spots"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where additional free radical damage might be increased by the higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; temperature.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In case you missed my point I will try to explain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Heat is not soley within the cells.</i><br>
<p>
But by far the larger part is generated there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It can be created in them </i><br>
<i>&gt; though I was meerly pointing out that dehydrated toes get froze.</i><br>
<p>
Thats because you are wiggleing them :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As water being rapidly pumped through the system </i><br>
<i>&gt; disperses warm blood amongst cold blood </i><br>
<i>&gt; the mean temperature is more easily kept regular(regulated).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel better now.</i><br>
<p>
True enough as far as I understand you. But it the blood flow is<br>
so fast and the blood volume so large (all 5 liters of your blood<br>
cycled through your body every minute) and the capillaries so close<br>
to every cell, that the body temperature will not vary much from<br>
one point to another as long as you maintain good circulation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; some do some don't</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;at high altitudes when they have a lack of white cells to fight them?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why should people at high altitudes lack white blood cells?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; My memory is not what it used to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I must try exercising my power of recall.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe I was getting high and low pressure confused?</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't saying they didn't. But that I have never heard of it and can't<br>
think of any reason why it might be so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;if I increase my red cells and my O saturation.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; My morning pulse is 44. My hematocrit (% of red blood cells) is not</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; high though). I have heard of young med students as low as 30. Using a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pulse</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; oximeter which measures % of hemoglobin saturation, I can hold my</i><br>
breath<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; without blacking out until my "SAT" goes down to about 85% (normally</i><br>
98%<br>
<i>&gt; for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; every healthy person). No one else I know can go below 90%.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;7-Any predictions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;8-Hmm...any risk?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I can't tell you what the risk is until you tell me how you plan to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Well, I don't plan to use a hyperbaric chamber </i><br>
<i>&gt; but I'm interested in learning about it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Off hand other than be a tranfusion of red cells (dangerous to play</i><br>
with)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; That's what I want.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A machine that replentishes the blood supply.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Out with the old, in with the new.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No eating, no drinking, no breathing, no muss, no fuss,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's the life for me.</i><br>
<p>
But red blood cells don't have anything to do with food. They only<br>
carry oxygen and transfused one will likely even be difficient of that<br>
You will have to breath even more to reoxygenate them.<br>
You body is already a very efficient and quite optimal life support<br>
system for your brain. Don't you realize that's what its real<br>
purpose is?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;1)What nutrients need what parts?</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Too detailed to go into here, but clearly proteins must be broken </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; apart into amino acids or short peptides,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I prefer to eat aminos in place of protiens,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I would if I could afford it financially.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; many vitamins and nutrients</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have active transport mechanisms form the intestines, </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wish I knew more about that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyone see a geni around here?</i><br>
<p>
Read the books that I mentioned before. There is no "royal road" to<br>
learning. It takes time and hard work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;the liver does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; essential modification of many vitamins and nutrients eg changing EFA's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; into triglycerides.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Read the nutrition and metabolism book which I suggested in my other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; message.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;2)The intestines perform a function.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;If that function can be quantified and reproduced externally that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;want.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I see where you are coming from (and trying to get to). I like the</i><br>
idea.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem is that the body is far too complicated physiologically and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biochemically, and our understanding is far too limited, for anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what you want to be possible for decades to come.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; ERROR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; GIVEN DATA UNACCEPTABLE.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, reality must always be acceptable else you are not all "here".<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I prefer feeding to take as little time as possible.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree. That's why I now do most of my feeding by drinking blended</i><br>
food<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "slurries". The blender 'chewing' the food saves me time and effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Occassionally, I still chew because I like chewing and its good for my</i><br>
<i>&gt; teeth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and gums which I don't want to atrophy (just yet :).</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I once made a salad slurrie.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I did not realize I could fit an entire head of lettuce in one glass!</i><br>
<p>
Its much better if you combine many vegetables with low fat tofu or<br>
cottage cheese.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The amount of calories I would have saved from blending.</i><br>
<i>&gt; were spent setting up and cleaning the blender. </i><br>
<p>
Naw! You slop around a little water in the bottom to rinse and drink that<br>
so less than a teaspoon is wasted, then you rinse immediately (before it dries)<br>
under a running tap. Usually this is sufficient and takes less than a minute.<br>
If still not clean enough, then simply "blend" some water and then rinse again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's only worth it if done in mass quantities or if I have no teeth.</i><br>
 <br>
I started it as a necessity when I got a full set of braces on. But now I plan<br>
to continue. However, a full blender is two meals worth and from cooked stuff<br>
I usually do two at a time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would rather everything be predigested </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;so I don't have to walk around waiting for my cells to be fed.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The predigested part is not so easy. I believe there are healthy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nutritional benefits of passing food throught the digestive system</i><br>
which<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cannot easily be gained any other way.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Like fiber soaking up toxins?</i><br>
 <br>
No, because fiber will not draw anything from *you*, only from the food.<br>
I am thinking of beneficial gut bacteria effects, but I don't have anything<br>
very specific in mind. I would need to do some research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I am trying to avoid using as many body parts as I can.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then there are easier ones to avoid using than the whole digestive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How about having your arms and legs amputated?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I've thought about it.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(Maybe leave your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right arm so you can type - or maybe not with good voice recognition)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is evidence that shorter people live longer. </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What should I search for?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nearly anything with "longevity" I've seen.</i><br>
<p>
Are you searching medline or the Internet? For all searching it is<br>
necessary to be very creative about the terms and names. You need to<br>
think of all possible ways the subject might be expressed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you have a hypothesis?</i><br>
 <br>
Probably to do with Body-mass-index (BMI) and the mass/surface<br>
area effect (the reason why elephants have such thick legs)<br>
CR gives lower BMI too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;It might be true</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the a happy arm/leg amputee who gets his exercise by rolling around</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and squirming on the floor might live longer too. :) </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I want documentation!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doctors will gladly give amputees bionic limbs, </i><br>
<p>
They are not very good yet though. I certainly wouldn't want to give up<br>
my natural leg for one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but I doubt many would take me seriously if I told them to chop me up </i><br>
<i>&gt; even if I agreed to pay them an arm and a leg.:- )</i><br>
<p>
Somehow I think you are right here. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;That way when I have to start replacing parts I can save $. :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;If food was processed( broken into componant parts and sterilized) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;before eaten many parts of the digestive system become unnessasary, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;such as the teeth, tongue, saliva, esophagus, stomach, stomach acids </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;which serve only to make bits of food smaller and more pure.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not just smaller, other imporant functions. Anyway some of the parts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you have listed do not wear our early or are not terminal if they do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't believe that anyone has ever died from a wornout tongue or had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a tongue transplant for that matter. :)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I bet you $10 Amer. someone has had a tongue transplant. :-)</i><br>
 <br>
Sorry, I never bet on principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also tongues can be very useful for lots of fun things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't want to be without one. :)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I would rather not have to worry about any more cells the I have to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I just another mouth to feed.:-)</i><br>
 <br>
But the cells of one part seldom produce free radicals which affect another.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;High O means low pulse/respiration, which means those parts last longer.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I you breathed up to a 50% oxygen mixture, the amount of oxygen in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; blood would only increase a little (the disolved %) since most of it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the "hypersaturated" (actively bound) hemoglobin. Your pluse rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would change very little. It is true that your would need to breathe less</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than half as frequently or deeply, however. But the cumulative long-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; damage on the lung tissue of the extra oxygen would probably negate any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; benefit.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I need to research this more.</i><br>
 <br>
Now your talking!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The big point here, Mike, is that "good old Mother Nature" has pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; well optimised us already.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; "Extropians look at the human body and say, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't this a marvel of nature, but I think we can do a little bit</i><br>
better." <br>
<p>
And we will eventually. But not just yet for at least a few decades.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mommy has poor distribution of resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We are made of C, H, and O because they are so abundant and flexible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but now our mother is telling us how to build bones out of titanium </i><br>
<i>&gt; and brains from diamond.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am still dying, my centuries are numbered, so I am far from optimal.</i><br>
<p>
But you were born too early for what you long to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).</i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A laudable goal, but how do you implement it without exercise?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Replace those muscles with machines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;This is already being done with today's technology.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Eventually, I agree. But we are nowhere near the "bionic man" yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Easier to try the amputee route mentioned above.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Have you done much research into cybernetics?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Few know what lurks in yonder top secret military installations.;-)</i><br>
 <br>
Knowing the general incompetence of governments including the military,<br>
I am not one who believes that they have any special high tech things<br>
that surpass public science and engineering and no one knows about.<br>
This idea is just so much nonsense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Movement means free-radicals.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So does eating,</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I am trying to make eating easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Solid foods tax the jaw and stomach muscles.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Use slurries as described above. (They also make taking &gt;100 nutrient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pills per day a breeze!) I expect they also make it easier on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stomach although the acid requirements will not be changed.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;breathing</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;More O = low respiration rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Or I could get better lungs( transplants, biotech implants, bionics).</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not for a long time yet. Our natural ones a pretty damned good.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Emergency life support systems work pretty well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They last as long as your insurance.</i><br>
 <br>
You are mixed up on what these do and what is essential. When young<br>
healthy firemen get burned lungs, they *cannot* be saved. They die!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and being alive. Free-radicals are both</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; harmful and necessary for life at the same time. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I do not belive they will ALWAYS be necessary.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, they will be. They are generated by the mitochondrial production</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of ATP in every cell (including your precious brain). All that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do is *control* them, not eliminate them.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hmm...</i><br>
<p>
Turn the "Hmm..." into some intensive learning about how you work!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It's where they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are formed and how they are dealt with that is important.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Absolutely!  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Unfortunately, I have had trouble finding ways to protect my my brain,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You can best proctect your brain by first all the same things as will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protect the rest of your body - your brain is *fundamentally* similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cells after all. Then you go after a lot of the "smart drugs" things</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which are especially brain protective.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free</i><br>
<i>&gt; radicals.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In the right places and at the right times, they are part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; metabolic processes of life.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;3)Would you mind pointing out those places and times </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;so I can begin thinking about how to make them better?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Done a bit above. Read a good biochemistry book.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Good books are hard to find.</i><br>
<p>
Start with _Harper's Biochemistry_ 24th edition.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; White cells use them to help fight germs too( rads not books).</i><br>
<p>
Quite correct. You're not as dumb as you look! :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wonder if they get out of control.</i><br>
<p>
A bit. No "search and destroy" operation is going to be totally efficient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would rather live without uncontrolled atoms smashing through my DNA.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The area to concentrate on most, IMO is the mitochondria, where there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; very few repair mechanisms for DNA damage caused by erratic free radicals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Our bodies can live with this only because we have multiple mitos in each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cell and because they can divide and multipy within the cell (except</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sometimes damaged ones mulitply faster than the good ones and destroy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cell). </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have lists of the leading causes of human death,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but what are the leading causes of cell death?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I looked but could not find anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A body count would be helpful.</i><br>
 <br>
This too big a topic to get into here. Read a book on cell biology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill</i><br>
yourself.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A much too simplistic view.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;It was only one sentence among many.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Don't make too much of it, ok?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Notice I did say EXCESS.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, you're right.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hey, thanks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's a pleasant and uncommon response.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I admit, </i><br>
<i>&gt; there is quite a difference between causing excess free radicals and</i><br>
<i>&gt; suicide.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe. But it is also going to kill you quite quickly for other</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Some have suggested( maybe on this list) that the low temp </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;may lead to life extension.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; No question of it IMO. I am very pleased that my morning body temp is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 95.7'F and it only rises to 97.2'F during the day. (and I am *not*</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothyroid)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;This could become a seperate thread: Low Body Temp.- Good/Bad?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think its definitely good, but CR, melatonin, (and genes) are the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; harmless ways to lower it that I know of.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Less body work = less heat.</i><br>
<p>
Its more the free rads damage per cell that you must work on not the total<br>
free rads.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Molecular agitation is another reason I do not want to use many body</i><br>
parts.<br>
<i>&gt; Is thermal noise a threat to health?</i><br>
<p>
No. Since its endemic, you can bet mother nature has taken advantage<br>
of it for many biochemical reactions and other body mechanisms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;How were you intending to do the basic exercise functions (walking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; breathing 'fully') you listed if you are confined to a wheelchair.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Geez, I won't chain myself too it or anything.:-) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I'll get up when I have too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Intense breathing exercises can build heart and diaphram muscles.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Doesn't do much for the heart I don't believe.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Let's not forget isometric exercises, working muscles against each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;like the bicept/tricept "show me your muscle" pose.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't think isometrices will fulfill the function of either aerobics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (heart, lung, arteries, veins, immune system, happy endorphins, etc( or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; weight work (prevent osteoporosis).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clinch every muscle in your body for a few minutes </i><br>
<i>&gt; and see if you heart is not racing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It won't build alot of strength </i><br>
<i>&gt; and won't put alot of strain on most bones, </i><br>
<i>&gt; you are right.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; About endorphins,</i><br>
<i>&gt; have you ever heard of anyone being able to release them at will?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sorry, I don't often give references for my beliefs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm too busy preparing for the possiblities.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But you *do* need to take time to read and understand the science</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; behind those possibilties!</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can not prepare for things I do not understand. ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Now your getting it!<br>
