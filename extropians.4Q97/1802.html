What Brent is talking about is allegorised by David Chalmers in his Fading<br>
Qualia model (which, as I recall, that metaphysical dualist rather<br>
surprisingly declines to accept).  As the neural structures with their<br>
supposed specific Searlean `causal powers' are chipped, something like the<br>
neuropathology of Blindsight would be experienced.  You'd find yourself<br>
mysteriously functioning quite competently while your dumbfounded and<br>
`blindspotted' consciousness assessed that you ought to be acting at<br>
random.  But this phenomenal glitch *already occurs*, to people without a<br>
single implanted neurode.  Brent's opinion is an act of faith (as, of<br>
course, is James's and mine to the contrary), and I guess we'll have to<br>
wait for some GregEganist experiment to learn which turns out to be the<br>
case.  But I judge that James's position is more firmly consistent with<br>
everything else we already know about the material world.  Surely Brent<br>
would allow a single atom to be replaced, or a single molecule (since,<br>
after all, this is always happening).  At what exact point of replacement<br>
would the allegedly unique powers kick in?  Even when one grants the<br>
extraordinary and difficult special character of experience - of qualia, of<br>
phenomena, of what mind's functioning *is like* from the inside - I can't<br>
see any reason at all to expect it to require any more mysterious material<br>
explanation than hypercomplex relatedness, which we know describes the<br>
brain and which can be replicated piecemeal (in principle at least) at<br>
whatever degree of granularity.<br>
