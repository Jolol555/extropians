I would just point out that the idea of Extropy is to move beyond<br>
what nature has given us through evolution, and take control over<br>
our own future. If you want to keep living as you "were evolved<br>
to live", then why don't you become Amish or something?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; natural disasters that happen on and off.&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    What could you possibly mean by "perfect balance"? From whose point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of view are you talking about? I wonder if it seems like nature is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; perfect balance to the rabbit who is getting his head ripped off by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bobcat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Actually yes.  Why do you think the food chain works the way it does?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Animals die, and animals are born.  What happens if all the bobcats stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing the rabits?  An over population of rabits, who use up all their food</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply.  Not to mention the bobcats go hungry.  In nature its all a risk.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it, some don't.  People don't really consider the fact that there might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws to life.  I myself happen to believe there are.  All cause and effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you think an ecosystem is?  The animals who die give life to others.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The native americans knew this and respected it, only taking what they needed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We on the other hand take whatever we want more or less.  And it upsets the</i><br>
<i>&gt; balance quite a bit.  Why is it do you think, that animals have been around for</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of years, millions, and are still here?  They are part of a developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; system of living, crafted and evloved over hundereds of millions of years,</i><br>
<i>&gt; tested against time, and still here.  I think thats a pretty amazing feat dont</i><br>
<i>&gt; you?  And here we come threatening to whipe out everything in just a few short</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand, which is nothing compared to how long the earth's been around.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wonder why there was never any global warming when animals still ruled the</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth.  Just some interesting thoughts I've been comtemplating.</i><br>
