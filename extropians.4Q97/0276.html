Over 11 years ago I changed to a "caveman-type"<br>
diet, eating only raw food, including a wide<br>
range of raw meats.  At that time I also<br>
started taking a range of supplements which<br>
has expanded considerably over the years.<br>
<p>
As a result I recovered fully from severe heart<br>
disease and mild cancer, eliminated recurring<br>
malaria from my system, recovered completely<br>
from the early onset of arthritis, eliminated<br>
chronic indigestion, lost about 60 lbs., and<br>
lowered my heart rate from over 80 to 55-60.<br>
<p>
I eat only two meals a day and fast on Sundays.<br>
I gradually find myself spontaneously eating<br>
less.  I don't eat anything between meals.<br>
<p>
I usually play raquetball five mornings a week,<br>
60-90 mins., and work out two or three times a<br>
week in the gym.  On Sundays I usually power<br>
hike up a 2,000 ft. mountain, and then run<br>
down.<br>
<p>
I have a sense that physiolgically, in some<br>
respects, I'm now 20 years younger than I was<br>
11 years ago -- my skin "snap-back" test seems<br>
to confirm this.  Even among regular hikers,<br>
few half my age can keep up with me.<br>
<p>
I haven't spent a day ill in bed in over 11<br>
years.  I no longer get even colds or flu.<br>
<p>
Although I take some hormone releasers (not<br>
as scientifically as I would like), my next<br>
step is to have certain biomarkers regularly<br>
tested and to embark upon scientific taking<br>
of hormone releasers or hormone replacement.<br>
Does anyone know of a doctor in Las Vegas<br>
who pratices hormone releasing/replacement?<br>
