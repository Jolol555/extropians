<i>&gt; &gt;Yes, but it would also have the effect of restricting legitimate posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sent from alternate e-mail addresses of members of the list. Any &gt;objections?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, me... I read mail at work and reply from my personal address, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; part because its the address I'm known as and in part because I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want my work address getting onto spammers' lists. So far I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; think that the amount of spam the list receives is worth worrying about.</i><br>
<p>
Seconded.  This is as spam-free a list as any on the Net; no need to<br>
fool with a good thing.  I've found it useful, in fact, to post from<br>
an address other than the one I gave to the list: since I can identify<br>
the address to which spam is sent, I know that anything sent to that<br>
address in bulk was sent to addresses harvested from postings, and is<br>
not legitimate list traffic.  I've successfully had one bulk mailer<br>
booted from his ISP because of that.<br>
