The point is not that it's a big effort to run the email list (though it<br>
does amount to significant work when you add in David's work running all<br>
our other lists, the archive, and the web interface). The point of making<br>
the list members-only (for posting, not for reading) is to internalize the<br>
benefits -- to make it a membership benefit to boost the reasons to become<br>
an Extropy Institute member. The more reasons there are to become a member,<br>
the more members ExI will have, so the more it can do (not to mention<br>
simply being able to survive, which just would *not* continue for much<br>
longer at the old, low membership rates).<br>
