Twink doesn't think so, but will Twink++? Can Twink give any meaningful<br>
statements about Twink++, or, for that matter, Anders++, X++, Y++?<br>

Several significantly superrealtime Mminds are a damn dynamic society. <br>
Transcension may occur within very short time periods, possibly less time<br>
than it takes for you to purchase a ticket to LEO. I don't think we will<br>
have a significant number of humans out of the gravity well living<br>
sustainably by 2030/2040. Besides, technosphere may expand hard at the<br>
light cone's limits. Get lost, in space? Might not be a viable<br>
alternative... <br>
