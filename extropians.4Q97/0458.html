<i>&gt; &gt; I use the term "singularity" in deference to Vinge, who is a professor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of mathematics. It's only a qualitative analogy, however: the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; simplest equations that describe the simplest qualitative predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't actually have mathematical singularities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the "singularity".  While a simple interpolation and future</i><br>
<i>&gt; projection of (for example) available computing power may show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; flattening of the curve.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, dear. Just because there is no singularity in the equations, there<br>
is no reason to postulate a flattening. My grossly-oversimplified<br>
curve is an exponential. My next-level approximation is an exponential<br>
with step rate increases over time.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd be very interested in seeing (and would write myself, if time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge allowed) an analysis of what a post-"singularity" plateau</i><br>
<i>&gt; might look like, given the most stringent constraints we know of.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously these constraints are products of our current understanding of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world, and thus may be suppressible given some future physics &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematics, but I think it a bit disingenuous to use a term like</i><br>
<i>&gt; "singularity" when our best current models of the world show bounded (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least, merely exponential) growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Vinge's other reason to use the term "singularity" is in the sense of<br>
an event horizon: in his model we cannot predict beyond it because the<br>
superintelligences are incomprehensible. I agree with him in this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are much wiser heads out there on this list, so let me just start</i><br>
<i>&gt; off the conversation with a few constraints that I can see (again, given</i><br>
<i>&gt; our current physics &amp; mathematics):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Size Constraints:  Our current understanding of QM essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; constrains the precision with which we can build physical structures (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; direct energy) via Planck's constant, thus creating an apparent lower</i><br>
<i>&gt; bound on our engineering ambitions.  This in turn has consequences for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Moore's Law, as to date progress has been made largely via finer and</i><br>
<i>&gt; finer lithography techniques.</i><br>
<p>
Planck's constant is many orders of magnitude away from affecting<br>
information<br>
storage structures.<br>
<p>
Moore's "law" (actually, and observation of existing trends) is<br>
currently<br>
driven by lithographic techniques, but it extrapolates backward fairly<br>
well<br>
all the way to the mechanical calculator. There are other techniques,<br>
architectures, and technologies that can step in to take up the slack,<br>
even before we begin to apply superintelligence to the problem. As a<br>
trivial<br>
example, while the current technology is lithographically at .25 micron<br>
or<br>
so, we use it to build chips that are placed in plastic packages that<br>
are<br>
placed on PC boards that are placed in chassis. The 2-dimensional<br>
densisty<br>
is perhaps 10% fo the chip density, and the spacing between transistors<br>
in<br>
the third dimension is thousands of times less dense. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Speed Constraints:  Barring some revolution to Relativity, c limits the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of expansion of even a Vingean Power.  In addition it limits the</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed of signaling within that entity's "brain".  Again suggesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible constraints on the rate of computational growth.</i><br>
<p>
This is true, but I suspect the ability to acquire mass is a much more<br>
severe one. For a given mass, you can decrease the effect of the speed<br>
limit by increasing the density, at least until the resulting material<br>
can no longer support a computational structure or until you form a<br>
black hole. these constraints are IMO far beyond the singularity.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chaotic Computability Constraints:  The most ambitious nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenarios posit universal assemblers that can be programmed or designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to build specific structures.  IMHO this is a clearly chaotic system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The structure of any complex object created by this sort of nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; would seem to display an exquisite sensitivity to tiny variations in</i><br>
<i>&gt; design of the assembler (or the assembler "software"), and possibly to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the local environment itself.  I question whether we'll be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; design assembler protocols for very complex objects through any means</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than trial and error, which have their own pitfalls (e.g., grey</i><br>
<i>&gt; goo).</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand. The idea behind nonotech is design to atomic<br>
precision. Assemblers and their output are digitally-described objects.<br>
a system built by assemblers will be essentially perfectly manufactured<br>
by comparison to today's systems, in the same way that playing a CD<br>
yields<br>
the same result every time since the recording is digital. Sure, I can<br>
conceive of a assembler process using stochastic techniques, but this is<br>
certainly not necessary.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm very interested in thoughts from the list on:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.</i><br>
<p>
Not within the predictable future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Just how severe and insurmountable these constraints are.  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt; superstring-engineering allow us to bypass Planck's constant?  Will some</i><br>
<i>&gt; new, higher-level theory of complex systems provide more computationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient means of simulating chaotic systems?  Will quantum computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any benefit here?  Can a sufficiently advanced entity construct a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pocket universe where Planck's constant and c are different from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; own?  Is there any way to communicate between that universe and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; one?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Not a problem for humans. Consult an SI for the answers!<br>
