<i>&gt; tactics and strategy, as well as simply industrial vs. hunter gatherer</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies, not because they weren't armed. Almost as soon as we got off</i><br>
<i>&gt; the boat, they were stealing, killing, or trading for our horses and</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns, and when they couldn't they were highly efficient at using what</i><br>
<i>&gt; was considered extremely primitive weapons technology to fight, kill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and massacre people. Before we arrived on these shores, the different</i><br>
<i>&gt; indian nations were almost constantly at each other's throats due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their cultural traditions of honor and counting coup. There is a limit</i><br>
<i>&gt; as to how many people can live on the land in a hunter gatherer society,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that number is far far less than that possible in an agrarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; society. They were always fighting over resources that, to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunter'gatherer were in constant scarce supply.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The native americans also knew well the principle of "live free or die".</i><br>
<i>&gt; That is why they died in such numbers, because to them, living by our</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways was not freedom. Fighting and dying opposing the growth of our ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; was the only honorable thing for most to do.</i><br>
<p>
    My naive and ignorant ideas?  I'm sorry my friend but how bout yours?<br>
Aborigines are actually an extremely peaceful culture.  Obviously these<br>
cultures _were_ armed.  Of course, that's not my point.  They respected<br>
their weaponry.  Used primarily for hunting.  And yes Native Americans would<br>
constantly fight between tribes, but on a whole, most tribes were a very<br>
peaceful people who respected life, and nature, unlike the European<br>
cultures.<br>
    As far as aborigines being violent.  White men came and take their land,<br>
and kill them.  When they got right off the boat, you say, they were almost<br>
imeadiatly fighting and killing?  Perhaps because they were smart enough to<br>
know what was going to happen to them.  When someone invades your homeland,<br>
first reaction usually isn't to let the invaders walk right in and push you<br>
out.  Of course they fought.  Before white men came Aborigines flourished on<br>
the coastlines, but were forced to move to the intrerior.  You speak of<br>
massacres by the Aborigines, but you conveniently happen to leave out the<br>
fact that the same was happening to their people.  People look down on<br>
"primative" societies, but I for one actually will give them more credit<br>
than what we call "civilization".  Aborigines can trace back their own<br>
history a good 40,000 years.  Under the same system of living, they managed<br>
to be around for that long, in peace with nature.  Here we come, in just a<br>
few short thousands years, and manage to cut down mass amounts of trees, use<br>
up mass amounts of resources, create nuclear weaponry capable of destroying<br>
the earth several times over, cause global warming, etc., and we consider<br>
our society superior?<br>
    And I beg to differ on your views about agrarian societies vs. hunter<br>
gatherer societies.  Nature sets limits, nature sets balances.  When you<br>
offset these balances bad things tend to happen.  Of course the limit of how<br>
many people can live on the land in an agrarian society is much greater, but<br>
is this a good thing?  Whoopy so we've mastered agriculture, and other<br>
various technologies that allow us to prosper.  With a hunting and gathering<br>
society, they live at the mercy of the land, and the population is kept in<br>
balance accordingly.  These cultures had developed a system of living that<br>
worked for them, they generally weren't discontent.  Our society is<br>
flourishing, sure, population on the rise.  That's exactly it, population on<br>
the rise.  Because of our technologies we can avoid the balances set forth<br>
by nature and our population will sky rocket.  And sky rocket.  Did I<br>
mention it will sky rocket.  What happens when the earth is so populated<br>
that our agrarian limit has been reached?  The ability to come up with a<br>
system of living that works along side with nature, and that can last tested<br>
agaisnt time for thousands upon thousands of years, is bar far just as great<br>
as many of the technological discoveries we've achieved.  Perhaps they had<br>
the right idea, but thanks to what we've come to be taught and know, we're<br>
the ones who consider them primative.<br>
    When I made that retort to your poem, I understood well that these<br>
cultures weren't unarmed.  I was hoping you'd be open minded enough to see<br>
my point wasn't that they were unarmed, but that they respected their<br>
weaponry, used it mostly for hunting, and only when needed as a<br>
defensive/offensive tool, yet remained to stay peaceful, to an extent native<br>
americans, more so aborigines.  The position you took was so classic, right<br>
out of white men's history books.  Have you ever read any books written by<br>
people who have actually gotten to spend time with aborigines, who have<br>
closely studied their culture?  If you have you'd find that the aborigines<br>
are actually a very peaceful, intelligent, and wise people.  May I suggest<br>
Mutant Message Down Under by Marlo Morgan.  Could prove to be interesting<br>
reading.  Your answers were of course vary logical, and yes I accept what<br>
you say about losing out to higher technologies, that's selfevident.  But<br>
they were also very onesided.  I've spent a deal of time studying cultures<br>
such as native americans and aborigines and I think your conceptions of them<br>
are actually fairly off, mostly factual, and facts you pulled out of a white<br>
man's text book.  Did you know that know a majority of aborigines have<br>
willingly stopped reproducing because they know their time on this earth is<br>
over, and have been pushed out by our agrarian society.  That is something<br>
very respectable in my opinion, in our culture you know we would never be<br>
able to do something like that, basicallly because people lack that kind of<br>
selfcontrol and respect for nature.  My main point out of any of this, is<br>
that there HAVE been many "primative" societies who have prospered and<br>
enjoyed life, with the use of minimal weapons, and with primative weapons at<br>
that.  The primary use for their weapons being to hunt food, not to kill or<br>
defend from another human being, although yes they were used for that.<br>
Think about how many gun owners today own guns to hunt soley for food.<br>
Think of how many gun owners live in cities.  And perhaps Jefferson was<br>
correct when he made that assumption, because if ever a culture tried to<br>
live peacefuly without being armed, they would probably end up all being<br>
killed off by some agrarian society trying to take their land and resources<br>
from them, because their population has become to great to be surficed with<br>
what they already have.<br>
