<i>&gt;Any other especially good books on organizational structures?</i><br>
<p>
I am going to look through a few that I don't own and get back to you <br>
on that.  Unless Robin has seen something in his studies, we can <br>
probably forget a sociological contribution--the field is still <br>
picking at its multicultural navel and fighting over the lint.<br>
<p>
I was going to stay out of the fiction debate.  But I thought _Host_ <br>
was not well written.  Short sentences.  Brain cells dying from <br>
boredom.  52 pages in, couldn't stand it.  Had to skip ahead.  <br>
To the end.  Find out what happened.  Aneuryism.  <br>
