Arjen Kamphuis asks<br>
: How about the diamond monopoly that DeBeers company has, they own more<br>
: than 95% of all the diamond mines in the world and are working hard to<br>
: buy those that remain, they have been dictating prices for a century or<br>
: so now.  [...]<br>
<p>
DeBeers has political friends.  Like Bill Clinton, who (I've heard)<br>
put an Arkansas diamond mine out of business (by making it a park,<br>
or some such trick).<br>
<p>
The Aluminum Company of America *did* apparently have a genuine monopoly --<br>
which it kept by keeping the price of aluminum *down*.<br>
<p>
: It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents<br>
: for solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.<br>
<p>
Are any of these patents more than 17 years old?<br>
<p>
: Daniel, with all due respect, why do you have such an unshakeble faith<br>
: in the free market mechanism as the best, only and ultimate resource<br>
: allocator? Isn't it a bit dogmatic? While free market is probably the<br>
: best system in many cases it is _far_ from perfect and in some situations<br>
: other mechanisms can complement it. There's nothing wrong with<br>
: aknowledging that some things can't and won't be solved by market forces.<br>
<p>
Experience suggests that if an agency is empowered to override<br>
the choices of the marketplace, it will go far beyond "solving<br>
the problems that the market cannot solve" and extend its power<br>
as far as it can reach.  I prefer the minor inconveniences of<br>
market solutions, to the side-effects of superseding the market.<br>
<p>
: The idea that there is a single method/solution/answer to all problems<br>
: is (IHMO) denying the complexity of some of those problems.<br>
<p>
The idea that the market represents "a single solution" is denying<br>
the very natures of market and government!  The market is many methods<br>
running in parallel; government is ONE answer imposed by force in place<br>
of all possible others.<br>
<p>
: How much would people have been willing to pay to win the cold war?<br>
<p>
How much would people have been willing to pay to save Stalin in 1942?<br>
How much did we pay to subsidize grain sales to Brezhnev?<br>
Both interventions kept the USSR alive longer than it deserved.<br>
<p>
America could have just stood back and let the USSR learn<br>
what Britain and France already learned: empires are expensive.<br>
<p>
(How do you spell Brezhnev in Dutch?)<br>
<p>
: I don't think the zillion dollars it cost. But it was money well spent<br>
: considering the alternative<br>
<p>
For whom?  America was never in any serious danger of conquest, only of<br>
destruction - and that was brought on by its own imperial foreign policy.<br>
<p>
: and, in retrospect, maybe even a good investment with the<br>
: technology spinn-off and the Chinese market opening up and such...<br>
<p>
How many war-dead is a spinoff worth?<br>
<p>
What research never happened, because the money to do it<br>
was taxed away to spend on war?<br>
<p>
How the Cold War is relevant to Microsoft, I'm sure I don't know.<br>
