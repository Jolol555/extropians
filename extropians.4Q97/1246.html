  CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT"<br>
<p>
<p>
  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
  I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800<br>
  inquiry, but it seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me<br>
  to go. CNN is spreading gross misinformation on television,<br>
  indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA 800  was part of<br>
  a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always promoted<br>
  what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile<br>
  theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not<br>
  sufficient to blame the Navy and I wish to move away from<br>
  that and all areas of conspiracy inquiry forever. But I<br>
  never said my inquiries were a "plot" or a "sham."<br>
<p>
  Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to<br>
  ask about my change of direction,  I did not contact her.<br>
  CNN reports now suggest that I said my conspiracy inquiry<br>
  was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do damage to<br>
  the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !!<br>
<p>
  My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit,<br>
  as I have for months, that my inquiry into TWA 800 was<br>
  an effort to identify untruth in the government. I have<br>
  a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian.<br>
  My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal,"<br>
  identifying my bias up front, unlike most sources.<br>
<p>
  Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to<br>
  portray it. The fact is that anything that is labeled what<br>
  it is up front is by definition NOT a plot. I'd say CNN<br>
  has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN label<br>
  its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No.<br>
<p>
<p>
  WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT<br>
<p>
  I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+<br>
  witnesses reported having seen something fly upwards and<br>
  explode at the spot TWA 800 was. That there were such wit-<br>
  nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported in the media.<br>
<p>
  CNN just reported in reference to me:<br>
<p>
      Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife<br>
      and two daughters in the crash, told CNN<br>
      that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana-<br>
      tion to the American public.<br>
<p>
  The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I<br>
  did not invent the witnesses. If anyone owes America an<br>
  explanation for the missile theory I think it's the wit-<br>
  nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and<br>
  commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery<br>
  thing shooting up was a Navy missile and the Navy is<br>
  covering it up. I also did not invent the Navy-missile<br>
  theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy<br>
  is known to have many missiles and is known to be off-<br>
  shore where the plane crashed. However, an inventory<br>
  showed that all Navy missiles were accounted for...<br>
<p>
  OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:<br>
<p>
  National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter<br>
  Goelz told CNN that my re-reporting of witness accounts<br>
  and theorizing that the Navy was at fault has done "real<br>
  damage" and "caused innumerable people great agony." Wow!<br>
  It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.<br>
<p>
  I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault<br>
  lies in part and primarily with the major media for ever<br>
  having reported the witness accounts in the first place.<br>
  I then made the mistake of suggesting that the Navy may<br>
  have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see<br>
  as a mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've<br>
  impugned the reputations of America's finest, which is<br>
  something I should not and do not now want to do, and<br>
  for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.<br>
<p>
  I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this<br>
  point I don't care! I just want to be left alone and<br>
  no longer harassed by the major media and others over<br>
  the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it.<br>
  It was a mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have<br>
  "caused innumerable people great agony." I'm a humani-<br>
  tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years because<br>
  I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.<br>
<p>
<p>
  CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY<br>
<p>
  I've never published anything I thought was false. I<br>
  even published errata notices when required. All claims<br>
  I've made were meticulously referenced so that readers<br>
  could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing<br>
  not just referenced information and ideas but all the<br>
  links necessary to access the larger body of information<br>
  about the case is what made my reports so popular and<br>
  what made this little guy the focus of world news.<br>
<p>
  My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment."<br>
  Wanting to move on from conspiracy theory and set a new<br>
  course, I asked Doctor David Stern, who hosts the DEEP<br>
  TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,<br>
  due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to<br>
  having been engaged in a "plot" and thus that I will-<br>
  fully attempted to mislead people to believe what I<br>
  knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern<br>
  temporarily replace all my reports so that people can<br>
  judge for themselves if I was the liar CNN suggests.<br>
<p>
  It will take David some time to get the reports back<br>
  up, but when they are up you can access them directly<br>
