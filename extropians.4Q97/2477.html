In the few hours since I first posted this, I've gotten a number of<br>
responses, and will include those who have expressed opposition to gun<br>
ownership today as responding negatively to the census.<br>
<p>
Tally so far (as of 10:20 pm EST, Sunday Dec 14):<br>
<p>
Owners         Non-Owners<br>
7              5 (3 of which are not American)<br>
<p>
Total numbers of guns owned (those that did not specify numbers I<br>
assigned a (1) to): 25<br>
<p>
Those of you who responded positively but did not specifiy quantities,<br>
but would like to do so, please remail me.<br>
<p>
WHile this is hardly a significant statistical pool, but since I do know<br>
that 60 million Americans have been estimated to own guns (out of a<br>
total of 250 million), the 7:2 margin among American respondants does<br>
heavily weight toward the original statement, that more subscribers on<br>
average own guns than the general population. Please keep responding, I<br>
will continue to tally the results for a week.<br>
<p>
All email responses will be kept entirely confidential.<br>
<p>
As for myself, I must first say that I personally account for 15 of the<br>
25 guns owned by respondents, so I tend to warp the bell curve (as I do<br>
in most things.) I have a hunting camp used by my whole family for deer<br>
hunting and trout and salmon fishing. In the whole family, I'd be safe<br>
to say there's at least 75 guns amongst 6 members of the family, most of<br>
which are family heirlooms. The Fish &amp; Game association I am a Director<br>
of has a membership of over 350 individuals and families, none of which<br>
that I am aware of, has ever used a firearm to kill someone, except for<br>
during military service. We host firearms safety courses for local<br>
youth, and sponsor junior rifle teams.<br>
