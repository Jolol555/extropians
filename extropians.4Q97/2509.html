John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; writes a nice little low-tech summary of<br>
tachyons, but I'm pedantic so I'll quibble with a few minor points:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff  </i><br>
<i>&gt;that has mass or energy or carries information.</i><br>
<p>
As you point out later, this isn't true.  Relativity doesn't say things<br>
can't move faster than light; it only says they can't move AT the speed<br>
of light.  (Actually, it doesn't even say *that*; it just says that it<br>
takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a non-zero-mass object<br>
to c.  And experiments bear this out to several decimal places.  But of<br>
course relativity could some day be proved wrong...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate  </i><br>
<i>&gt;instantly and for unlimited distances.</i><br>
<p>
No, it's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate<br>
without measurable delay over a few meters.  That's a big difference.<br>
The effects definitely propagate faster than light, but it may only be,<br>
for example, 100c.  As methods for measuring time get better, we may be<br>
able to put better bounds on that (say, &gt;10^6 c), but I doubt we'll<br>
ever be able to prove the effect is precisely instantaneous.  And the<br>
experimental apparatus (I assume you're referring to Alain Aspect's EPR<br>
experiments) is only a few meters big, so saying "unlimited distances"<br>
is far too strong a claim for what's been actually verified<br>
experimentally.<br>
<p>
And before anybody gets any ideas about "definitely faster than light",<br>
remember that (as John correctly points out later in his post) these<br>
effects can not be used to transmit information, because the correllations<br>
can only be seen *after* you compare the data using conventional information<br>
transfer methods (eg., walking across the room to the other end of the<br>
apparatus :-).<br>
