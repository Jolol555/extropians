All the counterpoints are well taken. Plus, even if you could determine that<br>
the "noise" exhibited some slight autocorrelation or other statistically<br>
significant deviation from randomness of the kind you expect (e.g., gaussian),<br>
it doesn't mean you could decode it. For all we know, pulsars are modulated,<br>
too, and we've come up with the naturally-occurring starquake as an explanation<br>
when the truth is that They are doing it.<br>
<p>
Re: optical spread spectrum, I seem to remember either inventing or hearing<br>
about a trick with quantum wells that ought to let you create something very<br>
like a free-electron laser.<br>
<p>
I nicknamed this a "caged-electron laser".<br>
<p>
These ought to be insanely efficient and might even be structurable as phased<br>
arrays, active countermeasures like the ones rumored to be in place on the B-2<br>
and FB-117*, etc.<br>
<p>
* I forget what that technology is called; it's the one where the material<br>
itself is primed and constructed with wideband rectifiers, dipoles, and other<br>
circuitry peppered through its bulk so as to return a spoof signal with zero<br>
processing delay--anyone out there remember the name of it? ...only on the nano<br>
level.<br>
<p>
BTW, Crit is up, and it rocks.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But as far as I know you can make redundant information look like noise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (later) Oh, PHIL started this thread!?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, like Phil says, you can make your signal have any spectrum you want</i><br>
<i>&gt; and probably be sloppy about things that people with only terahertz</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology can't detect--if they're who you're trying to hide from.</i><br>

<i>&gt; *The Diamond Age* had those nanites with light-wavelength communication</i><br>
<i>&gt; that appeared as colored sparkles.  You don't have to actually wiggle the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclei to control photons.  Light waves are pretty long in nanometers--</i><br>
<i>&gt; ~600-1200nm?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess interstellar stealth will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; mainly developed to hide from *local* enemies--people from your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; planet with technology similar to or somewhat better than yours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You could extend "Good fences make good neighbors" to "Interstellar</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilizations only spread as far &amp; fast as their crypto technology</i><br>
