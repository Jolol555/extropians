<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Libertarians seem to think that they have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; an inherent right to property upon which a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.</i><br>
<p>
The U.S. is not a person, and thus has no rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The population was here before the government was.</i><br>
<p>
Consent is the highest form of acceptance. Think of acceptance as a scale,<br>
with gun-to-the-head *submission* on one end, and yes-that's-what-I-want<br>
*consent* on the other end. When viewed in this manner, it is clear that<br>
obey-or-leave-the-country is closer, on the scale of acceptance, to<br>
submission than it is to consent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This brings up my major question about Libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of two things would need to happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  </i><br>
<p>
Not so. See below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But as long as there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people</i><br>
<i>&gt;will always attempt to do so.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
<p>
Libertarians unilaterally decide that aggression (initiation of force) is<br>
immoral, while proportionate defense against aggression is moral. I call<br>
this the Primethic Decision. This means that a libertarian will recognize<br>
and respect everyone's right to consent (to that which would otherwise be<br>
aggression), but will consider it moral to defend themselves wrt those who<br>
do not make the Primethic Decision, i.e. non-libertarians.<br>
<p>
The Primethic Decision (that aggression is immoral and defense is moral)<br>
thus establishes the right to consent, which is the basis for all universal,<br>
reciprocol rights. IOW, universal, reciprocol rights cannot exist without<br>
first recognizing the right to consent, which can only come from the<br>
Primethic Decision. All else is by consensual agreement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.</i><br>
<p>
It is not necessary that all adhere. Those who do not, should they aggress<br>
against others, are simply, and morally, defended against.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Can anyone talk me out of this?</i><br>
<p>
Does this help?<br>
