<i>&gt; Dear people,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm new to all this talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I have few queries,...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How does one handle 100s of mails</i><br>

<i>&gt; a full time job ?</i><br>
<p>
Good filters. :) There's also the seeming paradox that the most activity<br>
comes from the people with the most time to spare, not the people who<br>
send a few high-Q posts, such as (to name three) Eric Watt Forste, Steve<br>
Witham, and Robin H.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you guys do your research and homework</i><br>
<i>&gt; before publishing stuff like that ?</i><br>
<p>
Some do, some don't. It's an open list, not a closed club. Consequently<br>
the SNRR is kind of, umm, well, mediocre or worse at times. Some good<br>
people get dragged into time-wasting arguments around here. Consequently<br>
*they* aren't perceived to be shining at their true luminosity, either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does your writings contribute to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian ideals, and thus creating a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better world for prospective post-humans ?</i><br>
<p>
Ouch. I'm guilty, I'm trying to not fall for every troll, but it's hard,<br>
and I need more practice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please feedback to me ASAP</i><br>
<i>&gt; before further disillusionments sets</i><br>
<p>
Hey, if you feel you have to tar every member of the list because there<br>
are some bozos, go ahead, but please recognize that's what you're doing.<br>
OK? :)Suggestions have been made for several ways to improve the SNRR,<br>
but nothing has been done, because the list is run by King Log, not King<br>
Stork. I dislike it, too. I'm getting better filters. And I don't like<br>
having to.<br>
