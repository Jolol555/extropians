Brian Atkins, &lt;brian@posthuman.com&gt;, forwards the following:<br>
<i>&gt; SCIENTISTS in the US have discovered an ageing mechanism in yeast</i><br>
<i>&gt; cells that may one day make it possible to slow the process of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; ageing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; They have found that the yeast cells become clogged with tiny coils of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic material DNA which break off from the chromosomes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; proliferate until the cell becomes overwhelmed and dies. These "mortal</i><br>
<i>&gt; coils " - to borrow from Shakespeare - appear to be responsible for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; process of cell death, at least in this kind of cell. </i><br>
<p>
It may be that this particular mechanism is the proximate cause of<br>
death in these yeast cells.  But this is obviously a special case of<br>
a more general "accumulation of garbage" problem.  Cells are designed<br>
to keep themselves clean; they have metabolism to deal with various<br>
undesirable products and digest or excrete them.  But these mechanisms<br>
are not perfect; the possible variety of things which can go wrong is<br>
almost infinite, and inevitably some waste products accumulate.<br>
<p>
It may be that specific treatments can be found for certain wastes, like<br>
the amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease or these DNA rings in stem<br>
cells.  But my guess is that this won't lead to a breakthrough in life<br>
extension (although it may help with certain diseases).  Fix the DNA rings<br>
and some other chemical buildup will kill the cells a little while later.<br>
<p>
Not to say that this information is useless; curing some diseases and<br>
possibly even a moderate 5-10% increase in maximum lifespan would be<br>
a wonderul advance.  But it is not likely to solve the aging problem.<br>
