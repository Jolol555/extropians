This is the current lead article from the 'Boycott Microsoft Website'.<br>
There's much more. Make sure to check their monopoly clock, it's now 11:54,<br>
at midnight consumer choice will be gone.<br>

           Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom<br>
<p>
           It's bad enough to have a company<br>
           sell shoddy products, stuff that should<br>
           never have seen the light of day, or that should<br>
           have been permanently recalled. It's bad enough<br>
           to have a company get away with this for years,<br>
           even making billions of dollars in immoral profits from<br>
           its defective merchandise. Further, it's bad enough to<br>
           have  this company held in high esteem by its clever<br>
           manipulation of the press, the educational system, and<br>
           the politicians.<br>
<p>
           But what really hurts is that this company,<br>
           Microsoft, will never be satisfied no matter how much power,<br>
           influence, and money it accumulates. This is because the head<br>
           honchos at Microsoft exhibit a compulsive need for control that<br>
           is the epitome of megalomania, a paranoid approach to all of<br>
           life's challenges. This is a company whose stated goal is 100%<br>
           control of every market it enters, and it enters a new market<br>
           every time it finishes devouring the previous one.<br>
<p>
           What, you may say, is the harm in such "success?" Well, do we<br>
           feel good that Russia has only Aeroflot? Are we complacent<br>
           when a single religion holds sway over a state or a country?<br>
           Don't we feel a sense of urgency, a fear of loss of freedom, if<br>
           one political party begins to have too much power in congress<br>
           or other branches of government?<br>
<p>
           Ah, but this is just business, you may say. Microsoft is not some<br>
           kind of cult or party with an agenda, is it? It's just about making<br>
           money and increasing its market share, right? That's the<br>
           American way!!<br>
<p>
           Except the market for information is not supposed to be for<br>
           sale. The market for information is supposed to be the ultimate<br>
           free market, and the very design of government in the U.S. has<br>
           always been about ensuring some degree of "free press" and a<br>
           diversity of opinions. Will that freedom be maintained if one<br>
           company controls the tools by which the press, the media, the<br>
           information channels we depend upon, get their job done?<br>
           Would we accept the notion that we would be guaranteed<br>
           freedom of choice if these tools were owned by a Jerry Falwell<br>
           or a Richard Nixon?<br>
<p>
           America's great blind spot today is its affection for commercial<br>
           giants, big business wheeler-dealers like Ted Turner, Steve<br>
           Jobs, Bill Gates, and other public figures. It seems like these<br>
           folks have free pass to control as much of the media and the<br>
           educational system as they want, because they don't profess<br>
           any particular ideology. Maybe that's the key: they have an<br>
           ideology of nothingness, of emptiness, of merely the voracious<br>
           desire to accumulate power for its own sake. This is an<br>
           ideology of codependency, a dependency upon marketplace<br>
           acceptance. A single holdout who decides he or she does not<br>
           want what this person offers is viewed, not as an open mind, but<br>
           as a stain, a spot to be removed, a defective element in an<br>
           otherwise perfect demographic monolith.<br>
<p>
           It is this ideology of squashing freedom of choice at all costs --<br>
           because freedom to choose something else means rejection is<br>
           always possible -- which is the heart and soul of not just<br>
           Microsoft, but the entire business world today. The difference<br>
           between Microsoft and other companies, though, is that the<br>
           tools used to control public perception, the tools of information<br>
           exchange that corporations need to regulate the markets they<br>
           control, are increasingly being held by Microsoft: digital<br>
           television, Internet software, PC systems, and more and more<br>
           educational products and toys. If Big Business is a boss,<br>
           Microsoft is the Boss of All Bosses.<br>
<p>
           The threat to freedom is not merely that a religious cult or a<br>
           band of political whackos will take control; rather, it is just as<br>
           probable that a band of ruthless, greedy control freaks who use<br>
           commerce instead of crime, who use information instead of<br>
           guns, will exert a cultural influence that will produce a<br>
generation<br>
           made up exclusively of morally impotent wimps. Greed and<br>
           powerlust are agendas just as religious in their nature as any<br>
           form of theology, and even more dangerous to freedom.<br>
<p>
           The threat is real; the solution, a bitter pill to swallow: like a<br>
           junkie going cold turkey, businesses who have invested deeply<br>
           in the Microsoft agenda must pull out. Now. Completely. At all<br>
           costs. Short-term results may be troublesome, but the long-term<br>
           results of freedom of choice have always been greater than the<br>
           short-term benefits of appeasement and immediate<br>
           gratification. A little lesson from history explains why.<br>
<p>
           First they came for the DOS users, but I laughed at DOS. So the<br>
           DOS users were consumed. Then they came for the OS/2<br>
           users, but I never tried OS/2. So the OS/2 users were<br>
           consumed. Then they came for the Apple users, but I wasn't an<br>
           Apple user. So the Apple users were consumed. Then they<br>
           came for the UNIX users, but I didn't understand UNIX. So the<br>
           UNIX users were consumed.<br>
<p>
           Then they came for me, but there was nobody to stand up for<br>
           me. So I was consumed as well.<br>
           ----------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
There's a whealth of juicy stories on the company and it's 'products'<br>
If you worrie about having choices and some control about the technology<br>
you will use to access all kinds of info between now and the singularity,<br>
inform yourself.<br>
