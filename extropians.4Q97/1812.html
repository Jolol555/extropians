Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; pointed out:<br>

<i>&gt; As things are going right now, I would not be the least surprised if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Singularity affects a minority of all humans, the rest living</i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively normal lives in the shadow of Powers simply because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't adapt fast enough, didn't see what was coming, didn't care,</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't have the money or just refused (there are a lot of people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; think our visions are actually horrible, remember that). Exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth makes differences grow exponentially too.</i><br>
<p>
	It is indeed very surprising to me that so few people are<br>
signing up for cryonics.  If the Prometheus project is successful at<br>
making cryonic preservation and restoration of a mammalian brain<br>
provably successful how many people will start signing up?<br>
<p>
	Why is it that so many people seem to want to die?  Could it<br>
be because our consciousness are just so scared from all the death and<br>
suffering to date that we just don't care for anything better anymore?<br>
