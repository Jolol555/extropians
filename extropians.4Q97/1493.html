You're right, almost...<br>
<p>
You have an intuition that the 2x1 beam is 'twice as big' as the 1x1 beam.<br>
So far so good.  The you try to measure their volumes and get infinity in<br>
both cases, and start elaborating a theory about different sizes of<br>
infinity.  I'm fairly sure that if you continue in this direction you get<br>
all balled up, and end up without a consistent theory that lets you think<br>
about this kind of stuff.  Let me suggest that the right way to think about<br>
this is to give up measuring by volume.  Instead, create a new kind of<br>
measurement that you can call 'Newstrom volume'.  This is a measurement of<br>
the cross-sectional area of the thickest bundle of infinitely long lines<br>
you can fit into a given volume.  A 1x1x1 cube can't hold any infinite<br>
lines, so it has a Newstrom volume of 0.  The 1x1 beam has a Newstrom<br>
volume of one square inch (note that Newstrom volume has units of area!).<br>
The 2x1 beam has a Newstrom volume of 2 square inches.  Then your intuition<br>
is preserved, and there's no need to invoke different sizes of infinity.<br>
<p>
There's a branch of geometry called 'measure theory' that gives us tools to<br>
think about this kind of problem. It deals with various ways of measuring<br>
how big sets are.  The basic concept is a 'measure'.  A measure is a<br>
function mapping chunks of a space to numbers, having these properties:<br>
<p>
1.  The measure of the union of a finite number of non-overlapping chunks<br>
is the sum of their measures.<br>
2.  The measure of the intersection of two chunks is less than or equal to<br>
the larger of their measures.<br>
3.  The measure of any chunk is zero or a positive number.<br>
<p>
A measure gets to restrict what kind of chunks it applies to.  For example,<br>
asking for the length of a 1x1x1 cube is not legal.  Neither is asking for<br>
the volume of a 1x1xinfinity ray bundle.<br>
<p>
Volume, area and Newstrom volume are all measures.  <br>
<p>
Measure theory is useful for fractal geometry, and for probability and<br>
statistics.<br>

PS.  I think I've got those axioms right; it's been a few years, and I<br>
didn't bother looking them up... <br>
