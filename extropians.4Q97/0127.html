  <br>
Er, the Latin alphabet was pretty derived itself.  Alphabetic systems<br>
(allegedly unique in origin, unlike hieroglyphic systems or syllabries)<br>
are traced back to the Semites.  So I could mean an original Semitic<br>
inventor.  <br>
<p>
Digression:<br>
The uniqueness is in using phonemes as elements, rather than syllables or <br>
words.  The other two types of systems have been independently invented<br>
multiple times; all true alphabets can be traced, in probable <br>
inspiration if not in design, to the Semites.  The original alphabet<br>
didn't have any vowels in it, and recently I've wondered if from the<br>
Semitic point of view it was functionally a syllabary.  In which case<br>
the true alphabet was actually invented by some Greek(s) who adopted the<br>
Semitic symbols, realized that none of them coded for vowels, fixed<br>
that, and thus accidentally created a phonemic alphabet whereas left to<br>
their own devices they'd probably have created a syllabary.<br>
<p>
Significance: English uses over a thousand different syllables, but 26<br>
letters.  We could use a few more, but still fewer than 50.  Syllabaries<br>
often have 50-75 symbols, meaning their language is restricted to that<br>
many syllables.<br>

I know that's what you meant.  The concept still doesn't seem<br>
applicable.  There is no Linux company to go public.  <br>

  <br>
Worthy opposition?  The product is free, powerful, locally modifiable,<br>
and can be supported by whomever you want.  Hard to beat that, unless you<br>
want to run Excel.  See below.<br>
<p>
} &gt; Java is being touted these days.  If Microsoft ported Word and Excel to<br>
} &gt; Jave people at least wouldn't have to deal with Windows.  <br>
} I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Java is not an OS, it's a programming<br>
} language, a lot like C.<br>
<p>
It's a programming language cum virtual machine, or else a programming<br>
language with a much larger standard library (i.e. graphics and<br>
networking); from either viewpoint "porting" applications is much<br>
simpler.  As you said, Microsoft's OS edge is the positive feedback of<br>
having all the popular applications; standards can catalyze their own<br>
growth.  Java applications can run on any machine and OS which supports<br>
the Java VM, or can be easily compiled for any machine with Java<br>
libraries (for C you have to worry about local extensions, like<br>
graphics) so your choice of OS/machines wouldn't be constrained by<br>
available applications.  You wouldn't need Windows to run Word or Excel<br>
if they were ported to Java; you could run them anywhere which supported<br>
Java.<br>
