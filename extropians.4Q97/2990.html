         <br>
<p>
Since violence or its threat would have to be used to stop me from saying <br>
what I want, I would have no moral reservation in using violence in return. <br>
However I'm a practical man, I don't fight for glory and I don't believe in a  <br>
fair fight. I would only engage in violence if I hopelessly outmatched my <br>
opponent and victory was virtually assured, unfortunately in dealing with the <br>
government this never happens, that's why I pay my taxes. I'm no hero, and <br>
I'm not stupid either. <br>

                 <br>
<p>
That is none of my business. I respect other people's rights, all I ask is <br>
that they respect mine.<br>

                            <br>
<p>
I agree completely. He's entertained millions hurt nobody and gotten rich <br>
doing it. It sounds very Extropian to me.       <br>
