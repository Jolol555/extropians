<i>&gt; Greg: what about Hong Kong?  It has a higher GDP/capita than any of the</i><br>

<p>
DOn't forget that democratic institutions in Hong Kong are less than 10<br>
years old. That HK has become so wealthy without a smidgen of popular<br>
representation for so long is rather the main problem preventing wider<br>
acceptance of "western values" in China and SE asia. They pointedly<br>
ignore Japan's stable democratic gov't that has existed in one form or<br>
another, since the mid 1800's. THey also pointedly ignor other <br>
democratic states with high asian populations: Hawaii, Seattle,<br>
Vancouver B.C., &amp; Australia. China, et al think that if HK can get so<br>
wealthy without democracy for so long, then they can too. THey pointedly<br>
ignore the implication that this makes them the running dog imperialist<br>
capitalists they revolted against....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And what are the odds of a more pragmatic approach?  Everyone yaks about</i><br>
<i>&gt; "human rights", like the Chinese are committing some obvious crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; against nature, or something.  David Brin points out that we can afford</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have a quasi-religious attitude to free speech because its benefits</i><br>
<i>&gt; are so miraculous.  Perhaps we should be pushing "cultural technology":</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways of organizing a society, like free speech, mutual accountability,</i><br>
<i>&gt; private property, as the best means to satisfy their explicit goals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like wealth and getting rid of corruption.  (And surely they'll care</i><br>
<i>&gt; about pollution at some point?)  People who object to Western culture</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "values" have no qualms about grabbing our factories and planes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps we should put more emphasis on the practical benefits of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies, and cut the appeals to morals they don't share.</i><br>
<p>
How about putting bots out on the web that prevent web browsers from<br>
computers in repressive countries from accessing western web pages, or<br>
conversly, to make the economic and idea flow on the web more<br>
beneficially one way, to prevent western browsers from accessing China<br>
based web pages, and pages in other repressive countries? Maybe as a<br>
virus that installs itself on browsers??? MSIE has enough security holes<br>
that this should be easy... I'm surprised this hasn't happened<br>
already....<br>
