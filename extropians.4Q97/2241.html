<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I've also seen simulations by oceanographers at UW a couple years</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago that showed that most of the rise in CO2 levels had much more to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do with the killoff of oceanic plankton in the southern hemisphere,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is directly and conclusively linked to the chlorine caused</i><br>
<i>&gt; ozone hole.</i><br>
<p>
Hm... "the chlorine caused ozone hole".<br>
<p>
(1) What is the primary source of chlorine in the atmosphere?<br>
<p>
(2) More specifically, what is the primary source of chlorine in the <br>
upper atmosphere over Antarctica?<br>
<p>
(Surprisingly enough, the answers to the two questions are <br>
different).<br>
<p>
(3) How do human (industrial and other) emissions of chlorine into <br>
the atmosphere relate or compare to either of these?<br>
<p>
(4) How much human-source chlorine is specifically in the upper <br>
atmosphere over Antarctica?<br>
<p>
(Answers: oceans, a volcano, infinitesmal, and essentially none.)<br>
<p>
(5) What do you propose the government, or anyone else, should do <br>
that would actually affect this situation?  <br>
<p>
I think that turning off <br>
volcanoes is currently beyond our technology, and coating the oceans <br>
with oil to prevent chlorine evaporation might have significant <br>
undesirable side effects.  :-)<br>
