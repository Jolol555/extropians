<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; [the usual tripe...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Guns? Real or otherwise? Haven't seen those. What's the FTC, some US</i><br>
<i>&gt; Federal agency?</i><br>
<p>
Federal Trade Commission, high and almighty protectors of the<br>
mercantilist oligarchy from the threat of (gasp) a monopoly that only<br>
controls less than 90% of the OS market, with a anti trust suite against<br>
a company that only occupies the #2 position in the browser market.<br>
Where is the antitrust investigation against Netscape for its 70% share<br>
of the browser market? I guess payoffs to the DNC and Clinton for Prez<br>
Cmmty will buy off anything...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Why are those</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;who don't like Microsoft's tacics not using those same tacticts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;since they obviously work? (And don't give me any bullshit about</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;how morally upstanding a company Netscape is).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fact that a tactic works is not always a reason to use it, the way</i><br>
<i>&gt; Saddam Hussein runs Iraq obviously works, he's still got his job unlike Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bush. That doesn't make it OK (I think). The people at Netscape problably</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't angels but at least they don't treaten my free choice in Operating</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems and PC-applications.</i><br>
<p>
No, only Andreesson and his buddy Ellison at Oracle want you to buy a<br>
castrated PC, called an NC, so you can only run their applications on<br>
THEIR servers, and you'll have to pay each time you use them. Now<br>
there's a route to take for personal choice....Or you could buy a Mac,<br>
pay twice as much for the same performance you get in your PC. There's<br>
another choice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I use OS/2 for most 'small' stuff and AIX (IBM UNIX) for 'big' stuff.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Haven't been able to find a good mailer for OS/2 (something that can beat</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eudora) so I use a Win 3.X box for that. OS/2 is pretty good, but you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; find as many nice app's on the net. The same for games, most are designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to run under DOS or W-95 (which is basically DOS with a nice shell). I</i><br>
<i>&gt; really regret that IBM didn't market OS/2 correctly since it has always</i><br>
<i>&gt; been (technically) better than windows.</i><br>
<p>
Right now I'm developing HTML front ends for legacy cobol AIX<br>
applications, that will be usable by anyone on the net with access to<br>
the front pages. XWindows is fun, and Netscape works just fine on AIX<br>
most current customer use is via dumb terminals which they will be using<br>
ALPHABrowser with, but while my bosses look at my work as extending the<br>
usability of the dumb terminals our customers use, I look at it as<br>
bridging them toward greater graphical capability when they get bored<br>
with the same old vanilla, they can go over to any graphical system and<br>
run the same apps from the browser of their choice...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;will do everything in its power to keep it in power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Was is not the US governement that broke up the monopoly of Standard Oil,</i><br>
<i>&gt; thus ending a monopoly that consumers and the competition could not break?</i><br>
<p>
Standard Oil had a monopoly on drilling technology and a capital<br>
advantage in distribution. Once drilling technology advanced, and<br>
distribution diversified, there was no need of antitrust action. THis<br>
was already starting when the gov't brought its case against Standard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about the diamond monopoly that DeBeers company has, they own more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; 95% of all the diamond mines in the world and are working hard to buy those</i><br>
<i>&gt; that remain, they have been dictating prices for a century or so now. </i><br>
<p>
DeBeers began as and remains a monopoly only by the laws of South<br>
Africa. It once was, in its infancy, merely a competetive cooperative of<br>
claimholders. GOvernment made it the giant it is today.<br>
<p>
Their<br>
<i>&gt; monopoly can only be broken by a new technology (Like MNT) that makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; diamond mining obsolete, but even then they may buy the patents of such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery and thus keep control.</i><br>
<p>
If a patent holder is that small minded to accept the bribe of current<br>
monoliths, then they obviously aren't smart enough to have figured out<br>
the be all and end all invention for that technology, and contrary to<br>
the paranoid dreams of resentful dreamers everywhere, most companies<br>
that buy up patents do indeed intend to use them. The problem comes when<br>
they figure out that such and so invetion is only cost effective if the<br>
cost of a given resource rises to a certain level. Usually by the time<br>
prices reach that level, or the cost of the technology to build the<br>
invention goes down (like Moore's law dictates for electronics), someone<br>
has come along with an even better invention....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents for</i><br>
<i>&gt; solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.</i><br>
<p>
And they do and have used them when the cost of energy rises, or the<br>
cost of the invention drops to the point where the new invention  is a<br>
cost effective change in technology.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;And it won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;be because some clueless group of whiners staged a boycott; it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;have made a better product. If you want to hasten that day, fine:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;don't avoid MS products; just keep buying good ones. Innovation is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;what kills monopolies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anbody that tries to make a M$ competing product will be aquired by MS or</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be cut of with technical incompatibility tricks. That failing, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal team of MS will create some clever licensing article that makes it</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal for end-users to effectively use such a product in combination with</i><br>
<i>&gt; any MS-product (they tried that against Netscape).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;and MS has never innovated in its life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here we agree 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; And in spite of this they (effectively) have a monopoly, so talent and good</i><br>
<i>&gt; product are apparently only (a small) part of the equation. Carpet-bomming</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing technique also has a lot to do with it.</i><br>
<p>
WHy is it that anti-MSers only perceive "innovation" to pertain to<br>
software technology itself? That is the sort of narrow minded view of<br>
the world that explains why these people and the systems they worship<br>
never go anywhere commercially. They have no idea that there is such a<br>
thing as commercial, marketing, or entrepreneurial innovation. How it is<br>
sold, how it is made, and how it gets to market are just as important as<br>
how it works to its commerical success.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Daniel, with all due respect, why do you have such an unshakeble faith in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the free market mechanism as the best, only and ultimate resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; allocator? Isn't it a bit dogmatic? While free market is probably the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; system in many cases it is _far_ from perfect and in some situations other</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanisms can complement it. There's nothing wrong with aknowledging that</i><br>
<i>&gt; some things can't and won't be solved by market forces.</i><br>
<p>
Its alright to acknowledge that some things don't need the hand of big<br>
brother to come and fix things for spoiled little brats who can't make<br>
it on their own. Isn't that a bit dogmatic? Why do you have such an<br>
unshakeable faith in the moral righteousnesss of government<br>
bureaucracies to best determine who and what is competetive and who and<br>
what is "cheating"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea that there is a single method/solution/answer to all problems is</i><br>
<i>&gt; (IHMO) denying the complexity of some of those problems. How much would</i><br>
<i>&gt; people have been willing to pay to win the cold war? I don't think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; zillion dollars it cost. But it was money well spent considering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative and, in retrospect, maybe even a good investment with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology spinn-off and the Chinese market opening up and such...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Someone should go the idea futures exchange and make the following</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;proposition, so that I can buy shares:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;"By January 1, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (or the aggregate of all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;sub-entities it may have been ordered to split into) will own less</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;than 50% market share in its product with highest sales."</i><br>
<p>
I'll agree with that, but I'll also say that no other company's app will<br>
have more than 10% of the same market, cause they still won't make them<br>
as good. THough that could change. I got a rather lengthy and in depth<br>
response to my list of bugs/fix demands, etc. from Corel the other day,<br>
regarding my extreme dissatisfaction with their Ventura product. It was<br>
the first time I'd sent a real life letter of dissatisfaction to a<br>
company. SOme of the problems I've found they have just fixed in the<br>
newest maint. upgrade, and other suggestions they liked and are<br>
implementing, while a few that I thought obvious and important they wont<br>
be doing, but I batted .800 with them so I guess I did pretty good. This<br>
is known as "market signals"<br>
