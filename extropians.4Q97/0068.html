This statement may surprise some who expected to see me out on <br>
Saturday with at least one of the women's and other groups mounting <br>
counterprotests to the Promise Keeper's rally:  I have decided to sit <br>
this one out.  I made this decision after reading reams of material <br>
and listening carefully to the statements made by members of PK.<br>
<p>
No, I do not agree with many of the statements made by PK leadership, <br>
and I don't trust their leadership. But I also see no indication that <br>
the majority of their membership rules the roost at home, either.  This <br>
is the 1990's, after all, and most women are accustomed to some say <br>
in the decisionmaking process at home, if not a large say!  <br>
Leadership may demand one standard, but the true results will be seen <br>
in the families.<br>
<p>
Simply put, from a strategic standpoint I see no gain to be had from <br>
ranting at a group of men engaged in prayer and reflection.  Most of <br>
the activities engaged in by PK members fall into the private and <br>
personal sphere, and I do not wish to contribute to the continuing <br>
politicization of those activities.  There are plenty of other arenas <br>
in which to fight the political battles.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
