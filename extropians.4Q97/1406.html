<i>        &gt;this plan.  </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
Anyone would oppose that plan because a genetic copy is not nearly good <br>
enough, even an exact copy made an hour ago would not do. It's a matter of  <br>
taste but personally I wouldn't be happy unless the copy was made right now. <br>
How long is now? For human beings about a second or two.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The continued existance of my "copy" does not make me  feel         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;comfortable with my death.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Of course not, but the point is you wouldn't be dead, you wouldn't even know <br>
something out of the ordinary had happened.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Even if you recorded my exact brain state, and reset his brain to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that exact configuration, I would still not want to die.</i><br>
<p>
              <br>
How do you know that this did not already happen yesterday at 9:32am ? <br>
How do you know it doesn't happen a thousand times a second? <br>
What possible difference would it make to your life if it did?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I just still desire to continue experiencing life.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Absolutely, but "you" are not a few hundred pounds of protoplasm, you are the <br>
way matter reacts when it is organized in a specific complex way. You are not <br>
a noun, you are an adjective.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;them?  </i><br>
              <br>
I don't want to die under any circumstances, but to me dying means having a <br>
last thought, a last experience, if I keep having them then I'm not dead.  <br>
I don't care what happens to the carbon atoms in my body, nothing special  <br>
about them, they're all identical and get recycled all the time anyway.<br>
