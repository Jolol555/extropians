<p>
This may be a little out of context, but it was the first thing that popped<br>
into my mind when I read this.<br>
<p>
In the last year or so, a couple pieces of pretty sophisticated image<br>
processing software were produced that could generate fairly detailed 3d<br>
objects and spaces by analyzing normal 2d photographs.  Some of this<br>
software is quite good at making educated "guesses" as to the nature of<br>
parts of objects that are not explicitly shown in the photographs.  Of<br>
course, the more different photos you have, the better the model that is<br>
constructed.  All in all, the best of this class of software produces very<br>
impressive results.<br>
<p>
The point of all this is that I see a clear convergence between the ability<br>
of computers (given the proper software) and the ability of the human mind.<br>
 The description of human visual processing quoted above, is noticeably<br>
similar to the computer image processing software I mentioned below it.<br>
Given the abundance of detailed 2d imagery of the earth's surface and<br>
man-made structures and objects, it would be possible for a computer to<br>
sample the world in much the same way we do by reading (for example)<br>
National Geographic.<br>
