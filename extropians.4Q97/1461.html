Infinite numbers do not obey the same laws of arithmetic that finite numbers  <br>
do, however, you do count them, that is determine how big they are, in <br>
exactly the same way, by putting them in a one relationship with something <br>
else.  I know that if I can put each of the fingers on my right hand in a one<br>
to one correspondence with some apples and have no apples or fingers left <br>
over, then there must be 5 apples. In the same way I can put the odd integers <br>
in a one to relationship with all the integers, both the odd AND the even, <br>
so there must be an equal number of both.<br>
<p>
        1 -1        <br>
        3- 2        <br>
        5- 3        <br>
        7- 4        <br>
        9- 5    <br>
         .<br>
         .         <br>
         <br>
Or you can prove that all lines are composed of the same number of points   <br>
regardless of length. Draw 2 parallel lines, a short one and a long one below <br>
it, pick a point midway along the short line but above it.<br>
                           <br>
<p>
                           /\<br>
                         /    \<br>
                       /________\<br>
                     /            \<br>
                   /________________\ <br>
                             <br>
<p>
Draw a line from that point to any place on the short line, then continue it  <br>
until you hit the long line. You've made a one to one correspondence between <br>
all the points in the short line and all the points in the long line, so they <br>
must have an equal number of points.<br>
 <br>
But not all infinities are equal. Let's try to put the integers in a one to  <br>
one correspondence with all the points in the line from 0 to 1 expressed as a  <br>
decimal.<br>
<p>
        1 - 0.a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 ...        <br>
        2 - 0.b1,b2,b3,b4,b5 ...<br>
        3 - 0.c1,c2,c3,c4,c5 ...        <br>
        4 - 0.d1,d2,d3,d4.d5 ... <br>
        .<br>
        .      <br>
        <br>
The trouble is it doesn't work, there are decimals not included, for example,  <br>
the point 0.A1,B2,C3,D4,E5 ... where A1 is any digit except a1, B2 is any <br>
digit except b2, C3 is any digit except c3 etc. This point differs in at <br>
least one decimal place with any point in our one to one scheme, we've used <br>
all the integers but there are still points remaining, so there must be more  <br>
points on a line than integers.                <br>
