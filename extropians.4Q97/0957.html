Suitable is good.<br>
I think suitable is probably less than you think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The body can handle free radicals</i><br>

Not well enough for me.:-)<br>

and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by<br>

Yet again someone says exercise is good and fails to convince. <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a dangerous and impossible long term practice and would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; extremely foolish to initiate voluntarily. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;after massive intestinal failure. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is true, but I make two observations:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) This is not for a major portion of a life time (and certainly not for</i><br>
<i>&gt;    an extended life-span). It is only done to extend what is clearly the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    terminal portion of their life.</i><br>
<p>
 One thing I have noticed about the medical establishment <br>
is their obsession with keeping the terminally ill on 24-hour emergency<br>
while failing to improve the "healthy" people <br>
who are not willing to pay up the ying-yang<br>
for drugs which treat symptoms <br>
and gismos that blink and beep.<br>
<p>
If your doctor EVER says "Nothing is wrong with you" <br>
get another doctor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) In line with 1), these people continue to deteriorate at a rate higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;    than others of their age.</i><br>
<p>
They most likely are host to MANY other threats if they have this<br>
procedure.<br>
Have you EVER heard of it being done to a person in great health?<br>
Hmmm? <br>
Well?<br>
Have you? :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; high altitudes may have increase longevity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;leading to a similar oxygen saturation? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it does, at least at high altitudes</i><br>
<p>
...altitudes or environmental pressure?<br>
Hyperbaric chambers increase oxygen saturation <br>
by sqeezing out other gases.<br>
I did a web search on oxygen therapy and found many interseting claims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Red cell count always,</i><br>
<i>&gt; lung capacity only if born at high altitudes, I believe.)</i><br>
<p>
Makes sense.<br>
People could also do streching exercises,<br>
I do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; these things may well not increase proportionately to the amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; oxygen deprivation. Thus, the cells may also learn to live with less</i><br>
<i>&gt; oxygen and as a consequence have less free radical damage. I simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know if this is true or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One person on the CRSociety list is proposing water restriction instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of food calorie restriction. If the above idea is true maybe if we all</i><br>
<i>&gt; practiced a little bit of oxygen restriction by breathing less, we might</i><br>
<i>&gt; train our cells to need less oxygen, and consequently produce less</i><br>
harmful<br>
<i>&gt; free radicals and make us live longer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Though it's an interesting thought, I am the first one to agree that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; make be quite wrong and impractical. </i><br>
<p>
Capillaries recieve less nutrients, blood thickens, <br>
heart/lungs pump more (free-rads),<br>
but if it extends my brain's lifespan it may be worth it.<br>
