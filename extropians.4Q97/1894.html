Umm, Brent, on this particular matter I think you may be off the beam a<br>
bit. I think they all look like they're at the same distance because<br>
there's only so much distance between my eyeballs. I am of the opinion<br>
that if I could provide myself with a long enough interpupillary distance,<br>
I could indeed tell the diference.<br>
<p>
I think there may well be representational/modeling nonlinearities, I<br>
*know* there are perceptual and mediation nonlinearities (for a simple<br>
example, a fixed frequency tone source changes pitch depending on how loud<br>
it is)... I just think this particulat one may be a somewhat bogus<br>
example.<br>
