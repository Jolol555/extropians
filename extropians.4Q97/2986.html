Hi,<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Brian D Williams thinks censorship is moral, </i><br>

<i>&gt;  Brian D Williams thinks no such thing, Brian D Williams is</i><br>
<i>&gt; provoking discussion by playing Devils advocate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you believe that if your children see a picture of 2 people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fucking or even seeing the word "fuck" will ruin them for life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;then it's your responsibility to stop them from seeing it, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mine. Personally I don't think the matter is important so I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lift a finger to help you, but they're your kids so I won't try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stop you either, however if you use that tired old excuse to limit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;my freedom I will fight you with everything I have, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;violence if I think I could get away with it.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't believe any such thing, (see above) I'm quite pissed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have my life limited in such a way, and I'll just ignore your</i><br>
<i>&gt; threat.</i><br>
<p>
Would John actually use violence if someone tried to prevent him <br>
from saying fuck or showing people fucking to that person's children?<br>
<p>
That's a pretty heavy thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;What it might do is put an end to "Hollywood Hippocricy" i.e.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Sylvester Stallones conscientious objector status during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;vietnam war only to make million's playing a big gun shooting war</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;hero later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The man is not a war hero, the man is an actor and that's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perfectly honorable profession. He showed intelligence in getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;out of the Vietnam war, more intelligence than most. When it's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;question of survival, when a bunch of goons want your labor and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;try to enslave you so you can perform a very dangerous,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unpleasant, and pointless job for them 12 thousand miles away, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;do what you have to do to remain free. I wouldn't have held it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;against him if he shot off his big toe to prevent it, or bribed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;someone, or pretended to be insane, or showed up at the recruiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;office in a strapless evening gown.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not questioning his choice about the Vietnam War, I've always</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought the draft was wrong, and such things are a matter of one's</i><br>
<i>&gt; own choice. I got in considerable trouble for supporting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; position when I was in the USMC. I had a two star general tell me</i><br>
<i>&gt; "unofficially" to cease and desist. By the way I was in Boot Camp</i><br>
<i>&gt; during the fall of Saigon, I enlisted and was 17 years old at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You choose to call what he did after "a perfectly honorable</i><br>
<i>&gt; profession" (acting), I call it hypocrisy.</i><br>
<p>
As someone who is not from the USA, I find such a comment strange given the<br>
fairly "pro-liberty" overtones to this interminable and occasionally<br>
fascinating thread. He hasn't hurt anyone has he? Isn't he free to do what<br>
he wants?  He's made a lot of money doing something harmless, shouldn't you<br>
be cheering him on? <br>
<p>
Hell, the irony of it tickles me to death. Good luck to him, I say. <br>
