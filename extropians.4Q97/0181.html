excuse me, but you have a lot to learn about what passes for ownership by<br>
law in white man's world (theft, murder, extortion, prostitution) and<br>
from personal experience i'd be quite willing to bet that the man's<br>
trucks were part of a scheme outright owned and operated by a thief (read<br>
mafia)... i suggest you pay a little attention to where the money is<br>
coming from and going to in this "economy" as they have the nerve to call<br>
it - try the "cia-drugs" list, which only scratches the surface of our<br>
wonderful means of "owning" our way of life. i have also had the<br>
experience to know that people who are so defensive about "coming up from<br>
nothing" have their own second thoughts about where the money REALLY came<br>
from. (actually, you have my sympathies, i have been there...believe me,<br>
you're better off broke than dead to God.)           -velvet<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't follow that...I have nothing against inequities...in fact I </i><br>
<i>&gt;beleive</i><br>
<i>&gt;equality of outcome is a farce...a myth perpetuated by "do-gooder </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Equality of opportunity is a different thing...although even it isn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a person owns something....it's no business of yours what he does </i><br>
<i>&gt;with</i><br>
<i>&gt;it...whether you think it fair...or not...and just because you </i><br>
<i>&gt;disapprove in</i><br>
<i>&gt;no way makes his use of his own property "theft"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My retort to people who make such an argument " If you're not using </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;building how is someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving into it theft? " is that it's MINE...and if you don't like </i><br>
<i>&gt;it...get</i><br>
<i>&gt;off your dead ass and earn your own...I've done it...starting from </i><br>
<i>&gt;ground</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero...twice...and I don't see why others can't as well...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And I was just this very minute talking to a guy...he saw me sitting </i><br>
<i>&gt;at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;table with my laptop...he didn't know what it was...he didn't know </i><br>
<i>&gt;what I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing...he claimed not to know how to read or wite...and yet he owns </i><br>
<i>&gt;two</i><br>
<i>&gt;trucks...and is buying three more...so he must be having some success </i><br>
<i>&gt;(he was</i><br>
<i>&gt;a "minority'" by the way...one of those poor downtrodden by the evil </i><br>
<i>&gt;white</i><br>

<i>&gt;I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;and this guy can...then THEY can .</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sorry for the vehemance...but theft...and the legitimazation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;theft...aggravates me.</i><br>
