<i>&gt; &gt; In addition to self protection, another benefit is the recreational.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have found that people who initially purchase one gun for self</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protection, practice with it a few times, quickly become hooked on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the enjoyment of the sporting aspects, and frequently expand their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; collection beyond that that might be reasonably needed for self</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defense, unless they planned on a David Koresh-like showdown with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; federales.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That David Koresh and company were under-armed for such an event is</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrated fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That they were in fact under-armed as compared to a comparably sized</i><br>
<i>&gt; group of Texans selected at random, is an equally well established --</i><br>
<i>&gt; but less well reported -- fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That 60 million Americans own 200 million guns means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those people own an average of 3.333 guns per capita. Self defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; experts will tell you that there really is no reason to carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything more than one main gun and a small backup, at most. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; leaves  1.333 guns in the average American gun owners posession</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which really has no defensive purpose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This assumes that any given firearm will either</i><br>
<i>&gt; *always* be among the first two choices as a defense weapon, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; *never* be among the first two choices as a defense weapon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

True. The pediatrician who delivered myself and my siblings had the<br>
habit of keeping loaded weapons in drawers and closets all over the<br>
house, yet his home was still invaded by a biker gang and he and his<br>
wife and kid were shot in the head execution style (not by his own<br>
weapons). My grandfather was his best freind, and a year later when the<br>
feinds were apprehended, he had gone to the trial with the initial<br>
purpose of taking the bastards out. They are all still rotting in jail<br>
thanks to appearances by freinds and families of the victims at parole<br>
hearings (those that are still alive).<br>
