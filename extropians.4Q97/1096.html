<i> &gt;&gt; Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; [the usual tripe...]</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is</i><br>
<i> &gt;it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like</i><br>
<i> &gt;the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?  </i><br>
<p>
Guns? Real or otherwise? Haven't seen those. What's the FTC, some US<br>
Federal agency?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Why are those</i><br>
<i> &gt;who don't like Microsoft's tacics not using those same tacticts,</i><br>
<i> &gt;since they obviously work? (And don't give me any bullshit about</i><br>
<i> &gt;how morally upstanding a company Netscape is).</i><br>
<p>
The fact that a tactic works is not always a reason to use it, the way<br>
Saddam Hussein runs Iraq obviously works, he's still got his job unlike Mr.<br>
Bush. That doesn't make it OK (I think). The people at Netscape problably<br>
aren't angels but at least they don't treaten my free choice in Operating<br>
systems and PC-applications.<br>
<p>
I use OS/2 for most 'small' stuff and AIX (IBM UNIX) for 'big' stuff.<br>
Haven't been able to find a good mailer for OS/2 (something that can beat<br>
Eudora) so I use a Win 3.X box for that. OS/2 is pretty good, but you don't<br>
find as many nice app's on the net. The same for games, most are designed<br>
to run under DOS or W-95 (which is basically DOS with a nice shell). I<br>
really regret that IBM didn't market OS/2 correctly since it has always<br>
been (technically) better than windows.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called</i><br>
<i> &gt;monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government</i><br>
<i> &gt;will do everything in its power to keep it in power. </i><br>
<p>
Was is not the US governement that broke up the monopoly of Standard Oil,<br>
thus ending a monopoly that consumers and the competition could not break?<br>
How about the diamond monopoly that DeBeers company has, they own more than<br>
95% of all the diamond mines in the world and are working hard to buy those<br>
that remain, they have been dictating prices for a century or so now. Their<br>
monopoly can only be broken by a new technology (Like MNT) that makes<br>
diamond mining obsolete, but even then they may buy the patents of such a<br>
discovery and thus keep control.<br>
It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents for<br>
solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;And it won't</i><br>
<i> &gt;be because some clueless group of whiners staged a boycott; it will</i><br>
<i> &gt;be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will</i><br>
<i> &gt;have made a better product. If you want to hasten that day, fine:</i><br>
<i> &gt;don't avoid MS products; just keep buying good ones. Innovation is</i><br>
<i> &gt;what kills monopolies,</i><br>
<p>
Anbody that tries to make a M$ competing product will be aquired by MS or<br>
will be cut of with technical incompatibility tricks. That failing, the<br>
legal team of MS will create some clever licensing article that makes it<br>
illegal for end-users to effectively use such a product in combination with<br>
any MS-product (they tried that against Netscape).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;and MS has never innovated in its life.</i><br>
<p>
Here we agree 100%<br>
And in spite of this they (effectively) have a monopoly, so talent and good<br>
product are apparently only (a small) part of the equation. Carpet-bomming<br>
marketing technique also has a lot to do with it.<br>
<p>
Daniel, with all due respect, why do you have such an unshakeble faith in<br>
the free market mechanism as the best, only and ultimate resource<br>
allocator? Isn't it a bit dogmatic? While free market is probably the best<br>
system in many cases it is _far_ from perfect and in some situations other<br>
mechanisms can complement it. There's nothing wrong with aknowledging that<br>
some things can't and won't be solved by market forces.<br>
<p>
The idea that there is a single method/solution/answer to all problems is<br>
(IHMO) denying the complexity of some of those problems. How much would<br>
people have been willing to pay to win the cold war? I don't think the<br>
zillion dollars it cost. But it was money well spent considering the<br>
alternative and, in retrospect, maybe even a good investment with the<br>
technology spinn-off and the Chinese market opening up and such...<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Someone should go the idea futures exchange and make the following</i><br>
<i> &gt;proposition, so that I can buy shares:</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;"By January 1, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (or the aggregate of all</i><br>
<i> &gt;sub-entities it may have been ordered to split into) will own less</i><br>
<i> &gt;than 50% market share in its product with highest sales."</i><br>
<p>
I read something about the 'idea future exchange', anyone have an URL? Thanx.<br>
If it happens, I'll buy y'all a drink (or ten ;-).<br>
If it doesn't, I'll buy y'all a drink too (I'll need one).<br>
<p>
greetings,<br>
