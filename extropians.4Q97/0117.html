<i>&gt;&gt; Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  the former. Although not named and often vehemently denied, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  leaves the latter, i.e, the concept, superior being, as the root</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  of "morality."  From the concept, superior being, comes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  concept, inferior being. This is inevitably followed by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  subordination and rule. Since history books and daily newspapers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  tell of the horrendous consequences, I need not elaborate here. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So it seems that, having assumed only two possible sources of morality and</i><br>
<i>&gt;failing to find them, you reject the possibility of an objective morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In his post, Gary Lloyd points to another possibility; that moral principles</i><br>
<i>&gt;arise naturally from the interaction of beings capable of moral choice:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In a message dated 97-10-02 22:25:49 EDT, Gary writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  behavior. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  reasonably</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is neither morality from authority, nor is it the non-morality of</i><br>
<i>&gt;complete relativism.  Interestingly for extropians, it is the morality of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;agoric system of freely interacting moral agents, a spontaneously developed</i><br>
<i>&gt;"natural morality."  One CAN rationally derive real moral principles simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the way volitional agents interact over time.  It is "objective" in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense that the moral principles that spontaneously arise from a "moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;marketplace" of free actors are independent of the actors themselves: The</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles are "true" apart from which particular actor we may consider,</i><br>
<i>&gt;subject or object.  Such principles do not fall prey to the metaphysical</i><br>
<i>&gt;fallacy, because they are not "real" in the sense that they have some</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence apart from the process of interaction itself.  But, even though</i><br>
<i>&gt;they aren't "real" in a metaphysical sense, they are capable of objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;verification because we can test the propriety of any particular principle</i><br>
<i>&gt;without regard to viewpoint.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian transhumanism brings an important new element to a view of "natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;morality" thus derived from the principles of free interaction of moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;agents.  Once one rejects the notion of an immutable ceiling on human nature,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the possibility that the analysis can be short circuited by actors in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;permanently "superior" position disappears.  If one accepts that not all</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans are created equal and that the span of a human life is ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited, then one can say that principles of moral interaction can be deduced</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a system of freely interacting moral agents, but that ultimately the</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans with the most power will be able to dictate final goals or first</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles (depending on how you look at it) of the system.  In other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt;one can end such an analysis in the conclusion that what is best for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;strongest is "right".  Thus one can conceivably derive fascism from, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;instance, the ideas of Nietzsche.  But when the "moral interaction game"</i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes effectively eternal and unlimited, the system becomes, in a sense,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"morally closed", because no moral actor can be assured of a permanently</i><br>
<i>&gt;superior power position.  Thus one rationally derives basic moral values of</i><br>
<i>&gt;tolerance and reciprocity from the very nature of the world of interacting</i><br>
<i>&gt;volitional beings.</i><br>
<p>
Yes!!! Finally, someone who "gets it." <br>
<p>
These spontaneously arising moral principles, not authority/submission, are<br>
what separates us from Hobbes' state of warre of all against all.<br>
<p>
They are the very essence of the primethic decision (primethic instinct?),<br>
providing the foundation upon which to build social systems.<br>
<p>
An objective analysis of the aggression/defense phenomenon reveals that the<br>
distinction between the two are clear at the extremes and ambiguous in the<br>
middle. <br>
<p>
Between those who have made the primethic decision, i.e. defense against<br>
aggression is moral and aggression is immoral, contention can only arise in<br>
the areas of ambiguity. Spontaneously arising social systems can be viewed<br>
as attempts to reconcile those ambiguities. The initiation of force corrupts<br>
and perverts those systems.<br>
