I agree that the pre-Sincularity era may be chaotic and that serouis<br>
technology-driven changes may occur. I am very interested in discussing<br>
the likely nature of these changes. What I'm frustrated about is the way<br>
in which the group concerns itself with libertarian issues, tax<br>
issues, welfare issues, etc. Even if the libertarian philosphy is<br>
valid in the abstract, the transition from our current politico-economic<br>
system to a libertarian one, or to any other substantially different<br>
one, would take so long that it will be overtaken by events before it<br>
can be completed. Basically, IMO libertarianism is a philosophy that<br>
describes one way in which a human society can constitute itself. But<br>
human societies don't generally change rapidly without a great deal of<br>
distortion and pain. I simply don't feel that such a rapid change is<br>
justified. The existing setup is good enough to see us through to the<br>
singularity without an earlier politico-economic revolution. I certainly<br>
don't object to refinments, but revolution is uncalled for. Instead<br>
as a society we need to worry about predicting and where possible<br>
ameliorating any negative consequenses of the inevitable pre-singularity<br>
technical upheavals.<br>
