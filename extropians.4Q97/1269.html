This is getting a little bit long, so I will just make one point.<br>
The URL I posted yesterday should shed more light.<br>

John K Clark, &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Not so, there is a set called the Power Set Of Omega (Pw) that has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; proven to contain aleph-one members.</i><br>
<p>
No, Pw has been proven to have larger cardinality than aleph null, and<br>
it has been proven to have the same cardinality as the real numbers.<br>
But it is not known whether it is equal to aleph one.  As I posted the<br>
other day, some people have suggested that it might be aleph two.<br>
<p>
Think about this, too.  How could Pw be shown to be equal to aleph one?<br>
You'd have to prove that there is NO transfinite cardinal between aleph<br>
null and Pw, that the very next cardinal after aleph null was Pw.  Nothing<br>
in between.  Show me such a proof!  You would revolutionize mathematics<br>
if you could.<br>
