<i>&gt; I missed that thread, but as I understand it the main reason for </i><br>
<i>&gt; feminist opposition to PK is the overt statements of the leadership </i><br>
<i>&gt; regarding the status of women in the family--mainly that the men </i><br>
<i>&gt; should take back control (not ask, take).  On the other hand, as </i><br>
<i>&gt; noted by several prominent feminists this week, if a membership in PK </i><br>
<i>&gt; results in the man being more attentive and caring and responsible to </i><br>
<i>&gt; his family, then that improves the situation of women, men and their </i><br>
<i>&gt; children, and it's difficult to argue with that.</i><br>

If it were a small private organization with no political aims, I<br>
wouldn't worry about it either--but one has to be suspicious of a<br>
group that can rally 1,000,000 men in Washington.  It is not unlikely<br>
that they will be perceived there as an influential lobby, trying to<br>
get their perverse ideas of what a "family" is written into law and<br>
enforced by the state.<br>
<p>
Good intentions are the most powerful tool of evil.<br>
