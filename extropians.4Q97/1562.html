<i>&gt;The adults of the Pacific giant octopus already have</i><br>
<i>&gt;impressively large brains.</i><br>
<p>
So I've heard.:)  Anyway, from what I've read/seen, their brains are divided up<br>
a bit.  Prima facie, it would seem there are multiple lobes which are somewhat<br>
independent -- which is akin to neural ganglia in insects.  (Still, the octupus'<br>
brain is much larger and more complex and centralized than the insect one.<br>
IF an insect's brain can really be compared here.  They are so decentralized<br>
that their brains are more like merely the biggest ganglia -- not at all<br>
like our<br>
brains.)  So, in this case, the thing to do might be to increase the<br>
connections <br>
between lobes.<br>
<p>
Of course,  I am assuming here that more connections = smarts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And octopi.  Take an octopus who has never seen a glass jar.  Put a </i><br>
<i>&gt;lobster in a glass jar with a screw-on lid -- an ordinary mayonnaise </i><br>
<i>&gt;jar will work if it's a small enough lobster.  Toss the jar in with </i><br>
<i>&gt;the octopus.  Within about five minutes, the jar is open (not </i><br>
<i>&gt;broken, open) and so is the lobster.</i><br>
<p>
I've seen this on TV.  It does show that they have a lot of potential.  (I<br>
wonder<br>
how many humans would pass?:)  It would also be exciting to uplift them since<br>
they are so different from us.  I imagine the ideas/experiences they/we could<br>
share would be fantastic/near-mind-shattering to us/them.<br>
 <br>
Now the thing to do would be to find out how easy they are to breed, raise,<br>
and handle.  I'm sure out of all the species mentioned thusfar, they will be<br>
the cheapest/easiest to procure/maintain/uplift.<br>
<p>
Also, we probably won't have to worry about meddling preservationist or<br>
retro-thinker types.  In other words, we can meddle in peace.:)<br>
<p>
Imagine: we can have a real transhuman project completed in less than a<br>
decade -- not an armchair fantasy/mutual mental masturbation but the real<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
