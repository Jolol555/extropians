<i>&gt; &gt; Question:  If you were to reinvent the rules of society, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; behaviour would you deem socially unacceptable and why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<p>
For interactions between adults, the only important rule is that <br>
taking anything from another person without their consent is <br>
prohibited except by order of a court on finding that the taking is <br>
necessary either as compensation for a taking which the other person <br>
has done or in fulfilment of a contract which the other person freely <br>
entered into.<br>
<p>
There are no other moral imperatives for relationships between <br>
adults.<br>
<p>
There are of course other issues where it is not important *what* <br>
behavior is accepted, but it is important that a small group of <br>
acceptable behaviors be defined and everyone behave appropriately.  <br>
For example, it really doesn't matter whether you drive on the left <br>
side of the road, or the right -- so long as everybody else in the <br>
area drives on the same side.<br>
<p>
And the responsibility of a parent to his/her child, and <br>
relationships involving children, are a more complex area.<br>
