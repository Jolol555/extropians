It is very easy to deceive yourself.  Feedback from respected peers can<br>
be valuable as a checksum.  If intelligent, like-minded people disagree<br>
with one of your assessments, it is a clue to evaluate that assessment<br>
very closely.  It may be wrong, or it may be a radical idea that no one<br>
else can grasp yet.  Either way, it is a signal to investiage further. <br>
Self-praise can just be a feedback loop with no added information. <br>
Praise from others can be additional information.<br>
