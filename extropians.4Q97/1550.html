Not that I see anyone really advocating this, but what exactly would this<br>
procedure accomplish for us? And is it ethical?<br>
<p>
My personal ethics can accomodate an uplift by way of cortical augmentation<br>
or other such biological procedure, but only insofar as it provides empirical<br>
data for use in similar procedures on humans. It seems unlikely that<br>
crossbreeding a chimpanzee with a human will give us any information along<br>
these lines and I have difficulty viewing this as uplifting a chimp, rather,<br>
it seems more like retarding a human being on purpose, and for no valid<br>
reason.<br>
<p>
I think any serious proponents of this idea need to answer at least two<br>
questions:<br>
<p>
1. Will crossbreeding chimps and humans help us augment human beings?<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
2. Is there any other reason to do it?<br>
