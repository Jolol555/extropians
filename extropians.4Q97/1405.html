<i>&gt; like me makes it any more acceptable for me to die.  If you told me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you had modified my brother to be exactly like me, I still don't see why</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would change my mind and let you shoot me.  Even if I really believed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you actually accomplished what you claimed, I still wouldn't change</i><br>
<i>&gt; my mind.</i><br>
<p>
I agree; neither would I.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of them?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am curious to find out why I am not thinking the way other people are. </i><br>
<p>
Here is something to think about.  If this copying and killing of one <br>
copy could be done, I think that the copy slated for death would <br>
quickly see your point. :)  *Before* the copying was done, the person <br>
to be copied can anticipate being both copies, and so it seems <br>
pointless to worry about which one dies.  Since there is only one of <br>
said person now, and since after the copying, there will still be one <br>
left, it seems that (s)he has lost nothing.  <br>
<p>
BTW, there is a good fictional representation of this atitude in <br>
_Permutation City_ by Greg Egan.  The main character keeps trying to <br>
perform experiments on uploads of himself, and can't understand why <br>
the uploads won't cooperate, even though HE has every intention of <br>
doing so.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe it is my own experience with my own copy (twin) that makes me</i><br>
<i>&gt; skeptical of this approach?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I don't think that it's genetic information that people <br>
really care about.  Nobody ('cept maybe in China) argues that it's <br>
okay to shoot every fifth or greater child by a given couple, even <br>
though little genetic info is lost.  What people care about is <br>
personal identity, and you and your twin abviously aren't the same <br>
person.<br>
