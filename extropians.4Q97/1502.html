<i>&gt; &gt;Has anyone heard anything about a piece of Mir landing near Vancouver, BC,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Canada?  Last night,(around 9pm PST) I say the most amazing light show</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which involved two bright streams of material flying very low overhead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;One very bright orange piece appeared to hit ground, as it was followed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;by low, thundering noises.  The rumour here is that it was a spent Russian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fuel cell.  Could something like this actually hit the earth?  If so, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are they dropping these things on my head? ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When you say 'appeared to hit ground', did you actually see it hit, or did</i><br>
<i>&gt; it go behind a hill?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't heard anything about this event, but from your description, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you saw was an object weighing at least tens of kilograms falling from</i><br>
<i>&gt; space.  Such objects are usually satellites or other space junk, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; occaisionally natural meteorites.  It was unlikely to be a piece of Mir,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since Mir is in a high orbit and is fairly disciplined about sending its</i><br>
<i>&gt; junk back to Earth on spacecraft, rather than simply throwing it away.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most satellites are of sufficiently flimsy construction that they burn up</i><br>
<i>&gt; before hitting the ground.  Re-entry would burn off at least an inch or two</i><br>
<i>&gt; of solid steel, and few spacecraft parts are so hefty.  When Skylab</i><br>
<i>&gt; re-entered, the only part that survived was a radiation-proof safe they</i><br>
<i>&gt; kept their film in.  In particular, fuel cells are not dense enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survive, AFAIK.  On the other hand, it probably was a Soviet or Russian</i><br>
<i>&gt; object.  They sent up a lot more stuff than the rest of the world put</i><br>
<i>&gt; together, and they weren't as fastidious as other countries about not</i><br>
<i>&gt; letting things fall out of orbit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They're dropping things on your head because the odds of actually hitting</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone are pretty slim, and even if they hit someone, the chance of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; held legally responsible is small, and even then, the cost of losing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrongful death suit are far less than the cost of launching the payload in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't know who "you" is, but according to the Russians and NORAD, it<br>
was a reentering Proton booster, reentering as previously predicted. The<br>
main body landed out to sea, while denser material, like the engines,<br>
had slightly longer trajectories that took them into eastern Washington<br>
State. Actual impacts have not been reported, but that is to be expected<br>
given the sparseness of that part of the state. Art Bell and other<br>
ignorant sensationalist ufo hounds are making all sorts fo outlandish<br>
claims that do nothing but make them look like fools to anyone who has<br>
seen the video footage shown on KING channel 5 in Seattle.<br>
