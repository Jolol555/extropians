Harvey Newstrom &lt;harv@gate.net&gt; had some great objections to<br>
transporters that destroy the original.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is a good explanation.  My objection to transporters is that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; may go through one, like Dup1, and never be able to know if Dup2 had</i><br>
<i>&gt; been created.  Is it OK to kill me?  I would say no, because I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not want to experience death.  The existence of Dup2 does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence my decision.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, this is precisely the problem.  The way to solve this is<br>
to use merged minds and effing of consciousness.  Imagine that the<br>
duplicate has some kind of communications connection that merges it's<br>
consciousness with the original.  Essentially making them the same<br>
supper conscious entity.<br>
<p>
	It's hard for us to imagine this since the conscious space in<br>
our brain is currently primitively very fixed, non expandable, and has<br>
only one point of view.  So to make it more intuitive, think of the<br>
seeing part of your consciousness being dup1 and the hearing part of<br>
your consciousness being dup2.  Together you can both hear what is<br>
going on in the "to" or copy location and see what is going on in the<br>
"from" or original location but you are, together, one conscious<br>
being.  If the dup1 is to be destroyed, it would be like being<br>
temporarily blinded, but you wouldn't be dead.  You would of course be<br>
able to reproduce the seeing part of your consciousness within dup2<br>
restoring your sight.  Though part of you temporarily died, because of<br>
effing of consciousness all of you would not have died.  This would<br>
mostly solve your intuitive objection to the idea through conscious<br>
continuity.  Of course destruction of any part of you is always a<br>
problem and avoidance of such is always desirable if possible.  But,<br>
if you are consciously spread across multiple platforms, you will<br>
always know that you can regenerate that particular part in some other<br>
location or time if necessary.<br>
<p>
	The important part is understanding what of and how our<br>
conscious worlds are made, and then learning how to connect these<br>
conscious worlds so that we can eff feelings, sensations... and share<br>
minds to preserve consciously continuity.  As you correctly assume,<br>
you must be directly (via effing or actual mind merging) aware of the<br>
creation of dup2 and be able to directly experience what it is<br>
experiencing.<br>
<p>
	By the way, Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;, made some very good<br>
comments about what I said.  Thank you for this feedback, Hal, with<br>
which I very much agreed.  I'll make modification to address some<br>
of your good criticisms.<br>
