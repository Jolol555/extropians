<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Because, with the highest energy and gas prices in the country,<br>
Californians probably don't want another 5 cents added on per gallon. A<br>
few years ago when the EPA mandated that the Seattle area use ethanol<br>
inhanced gas (sold as "oxygenated") to reduce smog, prices went up by<br>
5-10 cents, and people howled. They didn't stop driving though...<br>
