I do not own a gun, and I support the right of others (and myself) to<br>
own guns.<br>
<p>
About a year ago, I began a relationship with a (then) married woman (we<br>
are still going strong) whose husband was a mercenary in southeast asia<br>
and a multiple personality. He did not take well to the situation and<br>
there was some serious concern that during a 3 week period when the<br>
woman was in Europe, that this man might cause trouble for me. There was<br>
serious consideration of obtaining a firearm.<br>
<p>
A friend bought a flare pistol which I borrowed and I obtained some<br>
pepper spray. After some serious thought I came to:<br>
<p>
If I was given a warning, I would ask him to leave. If he did not, I'd<br>
use the pepper spray if he attempted entry. If he did enter and was<br>
still mobile after the pepper spray, I'd use the flare pistol. At this<br>
point, I'd have no compunction hog tying him on his belly which for a<br>
middle aged courpulent man has in many cases resulted in death... And<br>
then call the cops...<br>
<p>
Well, it didn't happen, and is very unlikely to. I returned the flare<br>
pistol and keep the pepper spray in an accessible but hidden place. And,<br>
I'm VERY glad nothing happened, it would have done incredible (and<br>
likely permanent) damage to my relationship.<br>
<p>
And, IF there is ever a violent threat or entry into my life, I will<br>
very likely get a gun, and the needed training.<br>
