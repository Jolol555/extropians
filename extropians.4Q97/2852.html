Possibly, depending on what distinctions are made re: terminology (a fight<br>
I have no interest in entering with you).<br>
<p>

<p>
This, while it is arguable, is a complete non-sequitur. The "if this is so,<br>
then" part of your sentence suggests a sequitur for which I find no<br>
evidence in any of the rest of your post. Are you, perhaps, throwing sand<br>
in the bull's eyes?<br>

I could argue that there is no method available that "-ensures- {emph.
mine] [one's] own personal autonomy and freedom", but I know of an approach
that seems to be recurrently popular the world over and has some success
rate: monopolize power and subjugate everyone else. It worked for Bokassa,
Amin, Dzugashvili, Emperor Ch'an... And _it's_ not a sure thing, and you
have to be a certain type of person.
<p>
I don't want this to devolve into a kneejerking match, but let me pose the
same question I asked earlier in a slightly different form: what is the
external cost of that left-for-dead fifteen year old girl?
