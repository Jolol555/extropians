No.  Halving the size of a quantum bit does not improve its computation.<br>
 Quantum computers will probably be most limited by the difficulty of<br>
isolating them from any outside influences that could collapse their wave<br>
functions.  It's a wholly different problem.  Generally very small<br>
improvements will make very big differences, but even those very small<br>
improvements seem very difficult.<br>

<i>&gt;Nanotech should make a huge leap, followed by a few more huge leaps,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and finally bottom out at something like a quadrillion times current speed. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Combine the two and you have enough computing power to do, well, pretty much</i><br>

a<br>

<p>
Yes, quantum nanotech would be incredibly powerful.  But it's not imminent.<br>
 Quantum computers can't yet multiply 3 by 5 to get 15.  We can't even make<br>
one individual gear for a nanotech device.  If Moore's law hits the wall in<br>
five more doublings, as he anticipates, neither quantum computing nor<br>
nanotech will be available to bail us out, barring a miracle.<br>
