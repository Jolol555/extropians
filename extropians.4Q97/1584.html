<p>
Maybe I should never have posted the MS-thing in the first place, but at<br>
the time I thought it was not total bull and a lot of fun besides (but<br>
taste in humor differ).<br>
<p>
In forming my opinions I must rely on others in some way for most subjects,<br>
because of limited knowledge and presence in space/time. So I must evaluate<br>
who to believe, who has the best story? What sounds logical/real? I've<br>
leared the hard way (also on this list as Lee so eloquently reminded me)<br>
that info, on the web espescially, should be regarded with suspicion.<br>
<p>
Nonetheless: I want to have an opinion about many things, more things than<br>
I have time reading-up about. The overwhelmingly large majority of<br>
IT-proffesionals I've talked too (and I talking to a lot both in- and<br>
outside IBM) is of the opinion that MS-products are primarily good for the<br>
Stock-value of MS. Add to that my own negative expriences with the 85<br>
different flavours of Windows. Add to that the fact that on the web one can<br>
find score's of 'I hate windows' 'MS-sucks' and 'Resistance is Futile, you<br>
will pay your upgrade' pages and this person is becoming convinced that his<br>
own feelings about Bill-ware are more or less correct.<br>
<p>
It's a bit like an other thread. Who go you believe? The FBI or Ian Goddard?<br>
The PR-department of a large company that stands to lose a lot of cash or<br>
my collegues-around-the-world and friends whom I respect and who's<br>
knowledge I admire? Not a difficult choice really.<br>
<p>
I'm reading-up on the TWA-800 thing, my picture is still very incomplete<br>
but so far I'm not inclined to believe the FBI-story. Which leaves me... <br>
This list will make a libertarian out of me yet ;-)<br>
<p>
