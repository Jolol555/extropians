Regarding my claims that a well-trained (in personal combat /<br>
self-defense skills) population is a good way to deter violence, Dwayne<br>
commented that if -everyone- is well-trained, the training is of less<br>
value.  I don't see why.  There would, of course, be wide variations in<br>
different people's skill levels, but it would be difficult to detect how<br>
well-trained someone was just by watching them in ordinary activities. <br>
Right now, most people aren't well-trained, so a street thug who is<br>
alright at fighting knows that he (or she) has a very good chance of<br>
assaulting someone and getting away with it.  But if everyone or most<br>
everyone was at least fairly well-trained, assaulting someone would be<br>
very risky.  The small woman you thought you could easily rape could have<br>
been training ninjutsu since she was a child.  Or the old man you thought<br>
you could hold up and knife-point for his wallet could have been training<br>
all his life.  You just never know.  It becomes too risky to just try<br>
assaulting people to find out if they're less well-trained than you are. <br>
<p>
<p>
The other factor is the other well-trained people around them.  People<br>
who are well-trained in self-defense aren't going to walk alone in<br>
dangerous places.  When bystanders are capable of mangling and killing<br>
you in a matter of seconds, violence simply becomes too risky to engage<br>
in.  <br>
<p>
When the populace are the police, criminals cannot survive.<br>
