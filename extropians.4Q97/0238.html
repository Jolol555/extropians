This is likely individual; some people and beings may want to<br>
grow forever, others may want to remain at a certain size. <br>

[One interesting take on this problem is Charles Stross' _Scratch<br>
Monkey_ (<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html</a>)<br>
where the Superbrights (&gt;H AI) compete with the Ultrabrights (&gt;&gt;H AI)<br>
for resources and most importantly, information input. I disagree<br>
with his model, but it is an interesting (and somewhat bloody)<br>
story about the relation between humans, transhumans and posthumans.]<br>
<p>
Matter (or rather processing capacity) will likely be scarce<br>
in the long run, since the "growers" will need it, and so does<br>
the "small is beautiful" individuals who don't grow but reproduce <br>
(the "small is beautiful" individuals who don't reproduce will<br>
form an ever shrinking subset of the population, and will not <br>
matter). So there will likely be competition, yes, but not<br>
necessarily war. <br>
<p>
War is so wasteful, especially when the enemy could easily deny <br>
you the resources you want by having his nanoprocessors self-destruct <br>
if he is killed; you would have to rebuild them at a noticeable <br>
expense. On the other hand trade might be a very common way of<br>
resolving the scaricity problem. It is of course possible to launch <br>
colonies near lightspead to get at the uncolonized frontier far<br>
away, set up a "info hotel" and wait for the customers to arrive. <br>
