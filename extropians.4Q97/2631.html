The poem said nothing about guns. It said unarmed. THis means whatever<br>
present state of weapons technology. COntrary to your naive and ignorant<br>
ideas about native americans and aborigines, they were not peaceful<br>
(only in the exception), nor were they unarmed. Despite an early numbers<br>
superiority, they lost out to higher technology in terms of fighting<br>
tactics and strategy, as well as simply industrial vs. hunter gatherer<br>
societies, not because they weren't armed. Almost as soon as we got off<br>
the boat, they were stealing, killing, or trading for our horses and<br>
guns, and when they couldn't they were highly efficient at using what<br>
was considered extremely primitive weapons technology to fight, kill,<br>
and massacre people. Before we arrived on these shores, the different<br>
indian nations were almost constantly at each other's throats due to<br>
their cultural traditions of honor and counting coup. There is a limit<br>
as to how many people can live on the land in a hunter gatherer society,<br>
and that number is far far less than that possible in an agrarian<br>
society. They were always fighting over resources that, to a<br>
hunter'gatherer were in constant scarce supply.<br>
<p>
The native americans also knew well the principle of "live free or die".<br>
That is why they died in such numbers, because to them, living by our<br>
ways was not freedom. Fighting and dying opposing the growth of our ways<br>
was the only honorable thing for most to do.<br>
