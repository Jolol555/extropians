Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Within the past few weeks I've received a good deal of spam scams on this<br>
frequency. Naturally, I've forwarded it all to the appropriate law<br>
enforcement agencies via fax from my office.<br>
In a previous note I advised you all that if you continue to receive<br>
nonsense spam offering multilevel distributorships or variations on themes<br>
of chain letters to simply send them via e-mail or fax to whatever law<br>
enforcement agency web site you feel is appropriate.<br>
<p>
Despite the claims of many politicians it's not violent crimes in the<br>
streets that is our biggest law enforcement problem. Rather, the greatest<br>
amount of money lost is through consumer fraud and other white collar<br>
crimes.<br>
<p>
Spam scams are among those forms of crimes. Eventually, the justice system<br>
will, hopefully, develop a new paradigm and a better understanding of this<br>
ethical and legal issue.<br>
<p>
Until they do, however, watch out!!<br>
<p>
