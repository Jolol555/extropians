Similar in Britain; I remember seeing several campaigns to raise<br>
money so children who couldn't get treatment there could fly to<br>
America for it. The only way that the British government can<br>
continue to fund the NHS is by keeping wages very low compared to other<br>
countries (which is why British nurses often go to work for private<br>
hospitals in America), restricting use by older people (and lately<br>
they've been limiting access to some treatments for smokers), running<br>
down the infrastructure and increasing waiting time for operations. <br>
<p>
In Britain, if you're over 70 and need a non-essential operation,<br>
odds are high that you won't get it from the NHS; if you do, you'll<br>
probably have to wait a year or two. How many Americans would put up<br>
with that kind of treatment, when with private healthcare they could<br>
have the operation in a few weeks, if not tomorrow?<br>
<p>
Of course a very large part of the cost of health-care is set by the<br>
licensing restrictions which limit the availability of medical staff.<br>
I don't know how those compare between the countries in question. A<br>
further issue is how long you try to keep people alive; I strongly<br>
suspect that US private hospitals would continue life-support well<br>
beyond the point when the NHS would pull the plug. That isn't cheap.<br>
