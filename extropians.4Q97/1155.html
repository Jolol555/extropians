There is a difference between a surveillance society and a<br>
transparent society. In a surveillance society only the government can spy<br>
on people, whereas in a transparent society everyone can spy on<br>
everyone else.<br>
<p>
Of course David Brin's transparent society is not completely transparent,<br>
since you'd still have your private thoughts. For that we need an<br>
implantable chip that provides a public read-only interface to the<br>
wearer's memories and thoughts. If these are cheaply available, should<br>
everyone be forced to wear them? I think the world would be a better place<br>
if everyone _did_ wear these chips, because it would completely eliminate<br>
all waste caused by people hiding information from each other. However,<br>
I'm not sure that the world would be a better place if it turns into<br>
Brin's transparent society, because in it you can still hide<br>
information--it's just more costly. It's not clear if the total amount of<br>
waste would be larger or smaller.<br>
<p>
I don't know how David Brin proposes to achieve his transparent society. <br>
It does not seem like a future that is reachable from the present. I think<br>
the mostly likely scenario for the near future is some mixture of<br>
surveillance for the offline part of our existance and anonymity for the<br>
online part. Slightly further off most of our activities will be online<br>
and anonymous. <br>
