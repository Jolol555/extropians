You qualify by quotes "rational values" indicating to me some reservation<br>
about the terminology. Personally, I have a problem putting rational or any<br>
other term, except, individual in front of values. I also have some<br>
questions about "ethics and "rational."  However, these are  not the  points<br>
I wish to pursue at this time. Let's look at "values" and "internally<br>
self-consistent." I'm particularily interested in the consistent part. There<br>
are many volumes of writing of all sorts that go and on about values. Some<br>
even talk about consistency. Unfortunately the consistency issue is usually<br>
discussed only in an area restricted and bordered by "sacred ideas." The<br>
inconsistency caused by these "sacred ideas" doesn't usually count as<br>
inconsistency.  Consequently, there is little recognition of and less<br>
discussion of the fact that nearly all embrace a dualistic value system that<br>
precludes consistencey. If we regard objective reality and truth as a matter<br>
of consistency, I think you can see the significance of what I'm saying.<br>
<p>
Have you ever heard a grieving mother whose son was killed in a war say: "I<br>
am proud that he gave his life of his country?" She certainly valued her son<br>
being alive, but at the same time, she valued her's and his contribution to<br>
revered "Country." This is, of course, the extreme, but it is<br>
representative. Are not "public welfare", "values of society", "debt to<br>
society", "national interest", etc. everpresent in the philosophy of nearly<br>
all? Does this not mentally divide mind into real self vs "ought self" with<br>
a dual and conflicting value system?<br>
Quite often, the conflict is not consciously recognized, but is manifested<br>
in distanced events with no conscious connection  made between cause and<br>
effect. Nearly all claim to be opposed to initiation of force and coercion<br>
even as they voluntarily support a governmental system whose definition and<br>
essence IS initiation of force and coercion.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Ergo, "morality" is a concept of superior being and subordination of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;individual. If I am mistaken about this, fine, show me and will appreciate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you wish to continue seeing ALL possible approaches to morality as</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-individualistic, I think you need to explain why this approach fits</i><br>
<i>&gt;your characterization.</i><br>
<p>
You are quite correct, sir; which is why that is what I have precisely been<br>
trying to do from the outset. You, at least, see where I'm trying to go with<br>
this, and why. You may not agree now, nor may you ever agree, but you do see<br>
my target and ,in effect, say, "Show me."  Terrific! I'll certainly give it<br>
my best shot.<br>
<p>
At this juncture, I am moved to interject a caveat of sorts and stand ready<br>
to explain at length any issue raised by my inquiry and analysis: To say<br>
that I am sensitive to language usage is the understatement of the<br>
millennium. Nearly half a century of looking at this subject from more<br>
angles than you can find in 27 geometry books has created this mental<br>
condition. As a consequence, I may make declaration about language usage<br>
that you wish to question. I just won't bother going into a detailed<br>
explanation unless you do.<br>
<p>
The first question that comes to mind is about the implied conclusion that<br>
the term, morality, can be validly used to symbolize both individual and<br>
anti individual philosophies. If the concept, morality, is based in the<br>
real, it is absolute by virtue of this reference; and an absolute cannot be<br>
qualified. It can't be part this and part that without an implicit<br>
declaration that objective reality is in contradiction of itself. The<br>
contradiction of "dual duty" shows up as contradictions in many places and<br>
many ways. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, when I now talk of "rational values" (not "objective morality")....</i><br>
<p>
I take it this means you reject the idea of objective morality as false. The<br>
term, objective, is definitively equated with immutable natural law, which<br>
in turn, stands as determining whether a belief is true or false. When you<br>
put the term, objective (true) with the term, morality, and say false, you<br>
have said that morality is myth. At this point, you are probably thinking<br>
that its only "objective morality" that you reject, but still hold to<br>
"morality" per se as true. Won't work. When you set "morality" against<br>
"objective" (true), you have nullified the term from EVER representing<br>
truth. How can you divorce a term from the very essence of truth and still<br>
call it truth?  By reference to what? (Do you catch the inference here that<br>
if "morality" is true, it is necessarily objective, and that any claim of<br>
"morality" as true, must necessarily defer to objective reality whether one<br>
is consciously aware of it or not?)<br>
<p>
In rejecting the term, objective morality, while holding that "morality per<br>
se" is true, you abandon claim of objective  discovery and implicitly insert<br>
the claim of subjective creating. If the created "morality" is true, then<br>
you must be the creator of truth. Aside from the obvious contradiction,<br>
creating truth, do you see a potential problem - a rather large one? What<br>
happens when your created "true morality" conflicts with another<br>
individual's "true morality?" Does it cancel to zero? Or do you argue that<br>
your "true morality" is superior to any other "true morality?" <br>
<p>
Does this sound familiar? Since the concept, morality, has no objective<br>
reference apart from subjective mind and feelings, there is no common frame<br>
of reference and it makes little or no difference whether one claims the<br>
"moral" to be individualistic, or another claims "moral" to be the "will of<br>
God." It is simply a contemporary version of the endless arguments over what<br>
is to be labeled moral or immoral. To put it another way: When you say you<br>
reject the idea of objective morality, I take it you mean that they who<br>
believe otherwise did not really discover their "moral values", but simply<br>
produced them in accordance with personal beliefs and valuations. Isn't this<br>
exactly the same thing that all do, even those who claim that individualism<br>
is the "moral?" <br>
<p>
This whole scene poses an interesting question: Those that presume to do<br>
"God's will" in anti indiviudal fashion invoke the "natural and moral ought"<br>
as psychological justification for these anti individual actions. Here, it<br>
is clear that individual is subordinated to the "moral" by direct reference<br>
to an alleged superior being.  In a philosophy of individualism, what<br>
purpose has the "moral ought?" Why is there such a struggle by alleged<br>
individualist to lay claim to the term, moral? There is nothing to preclude<br>
any individual from choosing and practicing individual oriented values<br>
without any label whatsoever. (I know this to be true because I and a few<br>
others do it.) Is not the dependence upon a "moral code" actually an anti<br>
indivividual psychological subordination to a mysterious undefind superior<br>
being something known only by a feeling of "ought?" If not, what's the point<br>
of using the word, morality, and indirectly supporting the concept,<br>
subordination, however it may be manifested? <br>
<p>
You recognized my objective as showing that the concept, morality, is<br>
inherently anti individual. I believe that I have exposed by definition that<br>
the concept, morality, is indivisible; that it cannot simultaneously<br>
symbolize individual and anti individual beliefs. No term can except by word<br>
games in which the term is not anchored in objective reality. There is, of<br>
course, much belief to the contrary as most are emotionally swayed by<br>
linguistic declaration without questioning whether the language does or does<br>
not connect to the objectively real, an absolute necessity to to determine<br>
actual meaning. The tendency to blindly accept a subjective label or<br>
arbitrary claims as an objective differentiation is an almost universally<br>
accepted practice that's plays havoc with thinking.<br>
<p>
In an earlier post, I pointed out that the common of all formal religions is<br>
subordination of individual to an alleged superior being; that no matter<br>
what the subjective label and claims of difference, the root objective<br>
identity of each and every one is fundamentally the same. The same<br>
observation applies to every governmental system with the common denominator<br>
of initiation of force and coercion. The psychology of subordination is<br>
clear in formal religions. The physical manifestation of it is no less clear<br>
in every governmental system. Indeed, the concept, religion, and the<br>
concept, government, are so epistemologically, philosophically and<br>
psychologically entwined that all alleged and claimed differences vanish<br>
when examined by the ordeal of definition. Whether an individual is<br>
subordinated to "Jehovah" or "State" is of no influence on the outcome.<br>
Another everpresent common denominator of "motivation and justification" is<br>
the mythical "moral ought."<br>
<p>
When we speak of subordination of individual to an expressed or implied<br>
superior being, what is meant by the premise? What actually happens in the<br>
psychological subordination that precedes the physical manifestation? The<br>
answer is highly visible in formal religion and only slightly less so in a<br>
governmental system: Real individual subjective purpose is displaced by an<br>
imaginary universal objective purpose. In formal religion, it is called<br>
"God's will." In a governmental system it is called "national interest",<br>
etc. The "moral ought" is ALWAYS from an alleged superior being, expressed<br>
or implied, admitted or denied<br>
The term, ought, has no meaning apart from obligation; an obligation not of<br>
one's own choosing, but claimed to be inherent in the nature of things. <br>
<p>
I direct your attention to the key and operational premise of "morality"<br>
regardless of what beliefs or claims exist to the contrary: The<br>
psychological displacement of individual purpose. This is the root premise<br>
of "morality." Since each individual, by nature, chooses an end desired,<br>
i.e. a purpose, to consciously and\or unconsciously deny the existence of<br>
individual purpose (whether we like of not) is a de facto denial of the<br>
individual itself. It is not dealing with reality AS IS. I trust I need not<br>
elaborate on the consequence of this error, since centuries of war and<br>
endless violent conflicts explains it quite well.<br>
<p>
Alas, perhaps you will say, "Tis true what you say of gods and governments<br>
wreaking havoc by their moral directives, but this is a false morality. The<br>
moral good can be achieved not by denouncing individual purpose, but by<br>
recognizing it in a philosophy of individualism." This belief, held by<br>
several, can be exposed as fallacy by  definition and logical inference.<br>
<p>
Apparently we have "good", but also the "moral good." I know of no singular<br>
reality that such duality of alleged meaning will fit. What do these terms<br>
mean, and why? Since I have already addressed this issue in much detail in a<br>
previous post, I will be brief in the definining of "good."<br>
<p>
Good and bad are hardly scientific terms. They are synonyms for suited or<br>
unsuited to purpose respectively. Is purpose objective (universal) or is it<br>
subjective (individualistic)? How does the answer definitively relate to the<br>
terms, good and bad? If means are suited to your purpose, do you not call it<br>
good? If means are not suited to your purpose, do you not call it bad? What<br>
if your purpose changes? Could not the very means that a second before you<br>
called good, you now call bad? Thus in reference to the identity, individual<br>
AS IS, we find that good and bad are not constants, but infinitely variable<br>
in step with the evaluation of means in respect of a specific indivdidual<br>
purpose.<br>
<p>
What now of the "moral good?" Does what is designated as the "moral good"<br>
change in step with the variable purposes of individual? Or have we<br>
abandoned the real identity, individual, for another realm and change the<br>
reference for the term, good? Can two such usages, two exact opposite usages<br>
(individual vs non individual) conform to a singular objective reality?<br>
Formal religionist point to "God" to answer the question. Informal<br>
religionist point to "society", or "nation" to answer the question, but what<br>
does an individualist call in to resolve the dilemma?<br>
<p>
If you speak of the "moral good", is that which you call the "moral good",<br>
"good" all the time? If it is a constant, "good" does not coincide with the<br>
infinitely variable "good" that is found in individual identity. Thus we<br>
must logically conclude that "moral good" is detached from individual and<br>
attached to something else. What? If "moral good" is a constant, it can be<br>
so only if it is tied in some way to an objective reality existing<br>
independently of individual choice. It seems we have come full circle right<br>
back to "objective morality" that was earlier declared false.<br>
<p>
If you say that initiation of force and coercion is immoral, that it is not<br>
the "moral good", on what you make the evaluation as well as valuation?<br>
Doesn't this require that you hold the end to which the means is suited as<br>
the "good?" So, now the pronouncement of good or bad is not referenced to<br>
means as when individual was recognized, the "moral good" is now attached to<br>
purpose itself. Thus is end itself shifted to means to some unnamed "higher<br>
purpose."<br>
<p>
If you hold peace and harmony as the "moral good", are you not indirectly<br>
declaring that any other end chosen is "immoral?" Clearly, such a position,<br>
expessed or implied, sets the choice, peace and harmony, as the "morally<br>
superior" over another end chosen by another individual. By virtue of what<br>
is one chosen end declared the "moral superior" of another end chosen unless<br>
it is expressed or implied that the source of this "superior moral value" is<br>
likewise superior to human individual. Look familiar? We're right back at<br>
the "objective morality" long obscured by word games. In short, the other<br>
individual's end chosen is mentally displaced because it didn't fit what was<br>
conceived to be the "moral good." Thus is the existent, real individual,<br>
denied no less than in formal religion.<br>
<p>
The issue is not WHAT end is chosen and set as the "moral good." The issue<br>
is that ANY END is chosen and set as the "moral good." As illustrated above,<br>
the choosing and setting of a "moral good" implicitly declares the "moral<br>
good" to be constant (objective), and to be superior (superior being) over<br>
the end chosen by individual. Thus does the myth of morality serve only to<br>
propagate and promote anti individualism in literally every sphere of<br>
interpersonal relationships.<br>
<p>
Since most know little of the principles and workings of their mind, they<br>
feel and thus believe, that if they consciously reject the idea of "gods and<br>
governments" that's the end of it. I'm afraid it isn't. Though one might<br>
think that talk of the subconscious and subconscious directives is a lot of<br>
mumbo jumbo, I assure you, it is quite real. <br>
<p>
If someone says, "I have the moral right to defend myself", what are the<br>
logical inferences of such a declaration and feeling? Does this not indicate<br>
the receiving of a sanction (right) to act? From whom, or what? If one feels<br>
the need to justify even the action of self defense, is not the<br>
psychological subordination of self to some named or unnamed superior being<br>
obvious? What's the source? Whether it does or does not have a name, it is<br>
the same source that sanctioned an end chosen as the "moral good" in denial<br>
of real individual. <br>
<p>
Thus, once more, I am obliged to conclude that "morality" is myth, and as<br>
myth is in opposition to real individual and a philosophy of individualism.<br>
The manifestation of myth is always end results exactly opposite of<br>
consciously declared intent. Ergo, all "moral arguments" are merely preludes<br>
to battle.<br>
<p>
Having been down this road a few thousand times, I knew from the git go that<br>
to assert that "morality" is myth is to encounter nearly infinite resistance<br>
and probable hostility from some quarters. So, be it. I'm not out to win a<br>
popularity contest. I'm out to promote individualism and attack as fallacy<br>
anything and everything that stands in the way of it. If it requires<br>
trampling upon "sacred ideas", this is not reason to hesitate. I function<br>
from no "moral dictate",  just personal choice. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Ergo, "morality" is a concept of superior being and subordination of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;individual. If I am mistaken about this, fine, show me and will appreciate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Delmar, way back in the first issue of Extropy magazine (in1988) I wrote an</i><br>
<i>&gt;article called "Morality or Reality" in which I took a position like yours.</i><br>
<i>&gt;While I still agree with much of what I wrote there -- especially about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way in which what most people call "morality" is ungrounded and</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-individual -- I no longer find it an adequate view. I agree completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;with you whenever morals are founded on a higher authority, whether a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mythical god, an earthly leader, faith, or a false philosophical idea (such</i><br>
<i>&gt;as found in Kant). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
After examining the foregoing, do you still hold that the viewpoint you held<br>
in 1988 is the same as mine that I express and imply in this post? If so,<br>
and you found error in such a position and abandoned it, I would be much<br>
obliged if you would point out these parallels and any parallel errors you<br>
might discover.<br>
