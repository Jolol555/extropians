In a message dated 97-10-10 18:36:56 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I think you're correct. But lst's ask:<br>
     Danny, how old are you? We know you've signed yourself<br>
 "some dumb kid" occasionally. You come across to me as a very,<br>
 very bright kid, but one who has not yet learned that the<br>
 internet gives you access to a vast amount of garbage.<br>
 It's your responsibilty to evaluate this stuff critically.<br>
 I'm actually happy to have you hang out here with us, but<br>
 you'll keep getting your ears pinned back until you learn<br>
 this. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Im 20.  Im into obscure nonmainstream stuff because thats where all the<br>
interesting things are.  Im aware of all the stuff that yall talk about but a<br>
lot of it is boring, and some of it is interesting, so thats why I stay on. I<br>
think the problem is a lot of you have closed minds and when you see a post<br>
from "CALYK.@aol.com" you immediately enter "bias mode".  It's like, people<br>
have ALWAYS been persecuted for sharing new exotic things with people, like a<br>
"round world".  It was a concept that you had to grasp conceptually, as well<br>
as accept a new kind of science, as is a lot of what I post.  Then even if<br>
you do you immediately say "bull" cause its so far out there.  I read that a<br>
lady got burned to death for teaching geometry.  Crazy.  You should look at<br>
the potential that some of this information can have instead of equivocal<br>
flaws.  <br>
