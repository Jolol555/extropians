<i>&gt;Nonsense, if classical physics was correct matter wouldn't even be stable.  </i><br>
<p>
We're arguing at cross purposes here.  I have no argument with this<br>
statement.  Of course QM is a better approximation than classical<br>
mechanics.  (We don't know that it's perfect, but it's certainly<br>
a better approximation.)  My point is that, for the MACROSCOPIC<br>
observable properties of most objects to be duplicated, quantum<br>
information is not needed.  A classical description is good enough.<br>
And, as far as I understand how brains work, everything in your mind<br>
that defines who you are is encoded in chemical bonds that can be<br>
described classically.  Physicists and chemists that study molecular<br>
dynamics often use only classical descriptions of the particles.<br>
(This is very close to my research area, so I can make this particular<br>
statement flatly, and know it's true.)<br>
<p>
I am *not* claiming that we don't need to know anything about QM to<br>
have teleportation; I'm claiming that there are properties that need<br>
not be duplicated in order to produce a FUNCTIONALLY identical<br>
duplicate.  Spin, for example, is probably one of the things that<br>
doesn't need to be duplicated.  And since spin is the only thing<br>
they've claimed to have duplicated, I think calling this process<br>
"teleportation" is a very bad choice of name.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All states are quantum states. Classical states are only approximations,  </i><br>
<i>&gt;sometimes good and sometimes very bad approximations of quantum states. </i><br>
<p>
See above.  I agree.  The question is whether we *need* the approximations<br>
to be better than classical in order to duplicate the macroscopic properties<br>
of objects.  (By "macroscopic" I mean anything bigger than an atom.)<br>

<i>&gt;        &gt;a *completely identical* brick, in all respects down to every last         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;atom in every position, except the quantum state of all its         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;constituent atoms and molecules</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is this a riddle? How can two bricks be completely identical except for being  </i><br>
<i>&gt;totally different down to the very smallest detail?</i><br>
<p>
We can describe the position of every atom in the brick relative to<br>
every other atom without resorting to QM.  If you duplicate that, I<br>
claim that you have a functionally identical brick.  I don't care what<br>
the spin states are of the atoms in my brick, as long as it can still<br>
be used to build my house.  Similarly, I don't care about the spin<br>
states of the atoms in my brain, as long as my memories and personality<br>
and everything else about my mind is duplicated.  And as I believe<br>
MRI scans prove, the spin states of the atoms are indeed irrelevant to<br>
to workings of the brain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think the enormous magnetic field in the largest MRI machines can be </i><br>
<i>&gt;detected by some people, I don't claim this fact has any great relevance to  </i><br>
<i>&gt;this discussion however.</i><br>
<p>
That's interesting, I hadn't heard that some people claim to be able to<br>
detect the field.  However, I don't know how I can state the relevance<br>
any plainer than I did already: MRI scans make dramatic changes to the<br>
brain at the quantum level, and yet the brain's functioning is not<br>
affected.  I think that's clear evidence that spin information, at least,<br>
is not relevant to the brain's working.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A photon has a well defined momentum and energy, if those weren't  </i><br>
<i>&gt;duplicated then quantum teleportation has not happened, I've not read the </i><br>
<i>&gt;article in Nature yet but apparently it has happened, unless fraud has been  </i><br>
<i>&gt;committed and I doubt that.  </i><br>
<p>
I browsed the original article several months ago.  The only<br>
property that was duplicated was spin.  I don't recall that it was<br>
actually photons; if that was the case, it would have been polarization<br>
that was duplicated.  In any case, the process doesn't "duplicate"<br>
energy because the photon already needs to exist at the destination<br>
and as I've stated several times already, this process does not<br>
change the energy of anything at the destination.  And it doesn't<br>
duplicate momentum either.  (That wouldn't be very useful if you<br>
wanted to teleport something into a reference frame moving at a<br>
different velocity, would it?)  They've only dulplicated polarization<br>
(or spin).<br>
