<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think Kristen is exactly right to suggest that there's no </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;difference between large private and large government scenarios. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the difference is like day and night. It's true that if a private </i><br>
<i>&gt;company kept getting bigger and more powerful and if the competition kept </i><br>
<i>&gt;getting smaller and weaker then eventually it would be fair to call it a </i><br>
<i>&gt;government. I can't point to the exact point where this transition occurs, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but I can't point to the exact point where day fades into night either.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: I agree, and also that it's a fuzzy transition.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;the only problems with gov't stem from the fact that it's so big </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem is it has no competition. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN:  But that it has no competition <br>
 and that it's so big are attributes<br>
 of the same situation:  monopoly.<br>
 In the case of gov't, a monopoly<br>
 of de facto land ownership.<br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Besides, land is not very important.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;IAN: It's as important as owning all of it means owning the basis of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;everything</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That sounds very 18'th century-ish, times change. As an Extropian you </i><br>
<i>&gt;know that even the old cliche about land, "they're not making any more </i><br>
<i>&gt;of it" is not true. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Yet virtually all Earth areas are <br>
 already claimed. We can build up or down,<br>
 or into or on top of water, but were still<br>
 within and dependent upon some preexisting <br>
 claims, until we become extraterrestrial<br>
 in a big way.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;You should also note that the richest man in the world did not </i><br>
<i>&gt;make his money from land but from information. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Right, what you do on top of the <br>
 land is most important, and yet, don't<br>
 forget all those hard drives and such<br>
 not only rest upon land, but came from <br>
 land at some point. We're getting more <br>
 and more out of every once of land thanks<br>
 to the privatized division of ownership.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'm just countering 100% anarchy. Minarchy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If it worked I wouldn't mind a small very limited government, but its </i><br>
<i>&gt;been tried and it doesn't work because it refuses to stay small and </i><br>
<i>&gt;limited. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: But this time it's gunna work,<br>
 trust me... he he he. But hay, we<br>
 also stared with anarchy and look<br>
 where it got us. I think a system<br>
 with some primary rules can actually<br>
 slow down the growth of gov't. But<br>
 growth unfortunately seems the rule.<br>
