<p>
Hmm, lemme dust off the back of this envelope...<br>
<p>
 ~1E10 neurons, ~1E13 synapses<br>
 say a synapse needs a 10 bytes of memory and 1E2 calculations per second.<br>
 That's 1E14 bytes and 1E15 ops/sec (not necessarily floating point).<br>
<p>
 To the nearest power of 10, workstation-class computers have<br>
 ~1E8 bytes and ~1E9 ops/sec.<br>
<p>
 So both the memory and the speed would have a factor of a million to go.<br>
 If speed only increases by a factor of 10 each decade (2Mhz in 1977 vs.<br>
 200 today?) that's 60 years!<br>
<p>
 But if memory goes up 1000 each decade that's there in about 20 years...<br>
 2017.<br>
<p>
 If you use multiple computers (say, 1000 PC's, 30 years from now) to<br>
 increase the speed, there's a networking issue.  Worst case, each<br>
 neuron has tentacles going everywhere and each computer has to receive<br>
 1E10 x 1E2Hz or 1000Ghz.  Best case, each neuron transmits locally and to<br>
 one other computer (out of 1000) , and each would have to receive 1E9 Hz,<br>
 just 1 Ghz.  But 10Ghz is only 100 to 1000 (depending whether you count<br>
 raw bandwidth or throughput) times the speed of current "Fast Ethernet",<br>
 and if you assume network switches rather than a bus-like net, that's<br>
 only a factor of 10 in speed per decade for the network.<br>
<p>
 (Note: according to the memory calculation, you would only need 1/1000<br>
 of a computer's worth of real-estate in 30 years--a fraction of a chip!?)<br>
<p>
 But using components specialized for being brains might slow you<br>
 down because it's harder to get chips designed and built than to<br>
 program PCs.  On the other hand, such brain-chips could already have<br>
 become an industry by 2027, used inside insect-robots or spy cameras<br>
 starting a decade earler...<br>
