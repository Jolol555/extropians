My views on this topic are somewhat controversial.  I know, having expressed<br>
them here before, the last time I left.  As I again consider leaving to pursue<br>
Real Life interests, I suppose it's only appropriate that I acquit myself in<br>
the manner to which I have become accustomed.<br>
<p>
I've reviewed those last posts often, and I hope that I've learned something<br>
from the experience, and from the informed criticism of my peers.  In<br>
particular, I hope I can now convey something that I failed to convey before.<br>
<p>
Anyone who studies General Relativity or quantum mechanics may perhaps begin<br>
to appreciate something of the true strangeness of the Universe.  It is not a<br>
human place and is under no obligation to obey human laws.  It is<br>
_unintuitive_.  Quantum Physics, thus capitalized, is usually cited as support<br>
of this, although in my opinion Special Relativity - much less General<br>
Relativity - is very much stranger.  And most of those who babble on about<br>
Quantum wouldn't know a complex probability amplitude if it walked up and bit<br>
them in the leg, which is the really strange part - that the foundation of our<br>
Universe depends on numbers which we call "imaginary".<br>
<p>
Perhaps to a die-hard algebraist this would be quite appropriate; after all,<br>
complex numbers are closed with respect to algebraic roots, which "real"<br>
numbers are not.  But nobody can see 2 + 3i cows.  Nobody can imagine a square<br>
whose sides are such that it has an area of -1.  We can't visualize it.  And<br>
yet complex numbers form the foundation of our state-vector-reduced "real" Universe.<br>
<p>
Human evolution is against complex numbers.  They form no part of the human<br>
mind.  They are foreign to us, external to our selves, our goals, and our<br>
natures, external to the regularities which forged the reality we now call<br>
Real Life.  And yet the true laws, the Laws of Physics, tick on regardless. <br>
We were not consulted, and our opinions have no effect on What Is.<br>
<p>
This, I believe, holds true of ethics.  Right and wrong are objective facts,<br>
and not facts which we or *any* volitional agent were consulted about.<br>
<p>
If you have a religious friend, try asking em whether God can, by an act of<br>
fiat, turn wrong into right.  Can God simply declare that the Holocaust was in<br>
and of itself a good thing, by an act of Its omnipotent will?<br>
<p>
One who answers "No" has stepped into a vast empty space and committed eirself<br>
to a frightening position indeed.  E has said that right and wrong are<br>
independent of Humanity and God, and are under no obligation to conform<br>
themselves to our desires.<br>
<p>
Consider Conway's "Game of Life".  Life proceeding under the cellular<br>
automaton rules is independent of all external influences.  If some living<br>
beings evolved on that vast grid, their religions would surely be false, and<br>
their fate decided by no greater authority.  They would be beyond the<br>
protection of God.  They would have no guarantee that the just would prevail,<br>
or that they would reach Singularity, or that any greater principle guided<br>
their Universe - save that two maintain and three give birth.<br>
<p>
One who states that ethics are beyond the influence of God, or beyond our<br>
influence, also states that ethics are beyond all protection - that we have no<br>
guarantee that our own conceptions have anything to do with it, that there<br>
*is* any "right".  For all we know, the Holocaust was a wonderful thing and<br>
liberty the greatest evil.  I'd sure like to know, which is why I keep putting<br>
so much effort into intelligence enhancement.<br>
<p>
What we are evolved to regard as "right" is as irrelevant as the numbers we<br>
evolved to see as "real".  True right and wrong are outside of our opinions<br>
and unaffected by them.  And nobody knows what right and wrong truly are,<br>
INCLUDING me!  When asked an ethical question, we are in the same position as<br>
a Newtonian physicist asked the true nature of time.  We can't possibly get it<br>
right; we must simply avoid all questions of "true natures" and go with the<br>
best guess we can make.<br>
<p>
Anyway, that's why I keep on having trouble in discussing this with the<br>
members of this List.  You keep on talking about evolution, and about what you<br>
think.  But that's irrelevant.  You and I can no more affect right and wrong<br>
that way than we can flatten the Earth.  Humans were not consulted here.<br>
<p>
You keep on talking about whether your goals will prevail or whether they will<br>
be subordinated to some higher authority, and I feel like a fish who has swum<br>
into a lecture on how to fly.  Is your opinion that the Earth is flat<br>
subordinated to the reality that it is round?  The two move in different<br>
continuums; neither can be "subordinated" to the other.  Opinions cannot<br>
triumph or be subordinated except with respect to other opinions.  With<br>
respect to ethics, you can't prevail over some higher authority or subordinate<br>
yourself.  Those are not your options.  You can either be wrong, or right. <br>
Opinions are either wrong or right.  Goals are either wrong or right.  And<br>
wrong and right themselves simply are, like all truth values.  You have placed<br>
yourself in the position of the student facing the legendary epistemology<br>
exam:  "Take a position for or against the truth.  Defend your position."<br>
<p>
It's true that opinions can strive against other opinions.  My goals can be<br>
forcibly subordinated, or I can be free to make my own choices.  And I would<br>
rather the latter, of course.  And I particularly wouldn't like my goals<br>
crushed by some overconfident moron who thinks e's Figured It All Out, which<br>
is roughly as likely as a preliterate Neanderthal figuring out General<br>
Relativity.  But if I choose to be ethical, I have not "subordinated" myself<br>
any more than a scientist subordinates emself to the truth.  It is not that<br>
there are certain truthful opinions, and the scientist "relinquishes" eir own<br>
opinions to be tyranically crushed by the truthful ones.  The scientist<br>
attempts to bring eir opinions into correspondence with the truth.<br>
<p>
Likewise, my goals are not "subordinated" to the higher goals which happen to<br>
be true right and wrong.  For one thing, I don't *know* what true right and<br>
wrong are.  So the process is as much a matter of truth-seeking as anyone who<br>
wants to know whether the Earth is really flat.  Getting emotionally attached<br>
to the goals evolution gave me as a starting set, identifying them with myself<br>
and going all protective, is as ridiculous as striving desperately to protect<br>
your conviction that the earth as flat.  I'm not talking analogy here, I'm<br>
talking simple identity.  Goals, like opinions, have objective truth values<br>
and come under the same rules as our models of reality.<br>
<p>
No doubt some people think that all goals have objective value zero, or that<br>
goals don't have objective values, or that assigned goal values don't have<br>
truth values.  I only hope that these people will understand that I don't<br>
believe as they do, and that ethical arguments between us are futile.  We're<br>
living on different planets.  I don't think there can be any point of contact<br>
between objectivist and subjectivist ethics.  It's as if a debate over the<br>
shape of the Earth was being conducted, where one side wanted to know what the<br>
shape "really" was and the other fought valiantly for freedom of opinion and<br>
decried any side that tyranically declared a single truth, or even that a<br>
single truth existed.<br>
