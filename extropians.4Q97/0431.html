I am really not going to get further into this here. The fact that most<br>
reported crop circles in Britain have been acknowledged by people as<br>
made by them to date, there has been no evidence of chromosomal changes<br>
other than that occuring due to cellular rupture and UV sunlight<br>
exposure, that the group that has claimed the most that it is caused by<br>
UFOs has been proven to have made fraudulent movies that were created by<br>
morphing software (after claiming that they were real), indicates to me<br>
that crop circles have much more to do with locals trying to buck up the<br>
tourist trade than ET visitations. Of course, my statements here are not<br>
real proof either, they are just statements. Proof would be in the form<br>
of several citations of scientific study that all reached similar<br>
conclusions, which you have not once provided. You will notice that such<br>
things are frequently referred to on this list. I will reiterate what I<br>
said in past posts to you: If you want to prove it, get off your duff<br>
and go out and do the research. If you are not willing to put in a<br>
respectable amount of work to prove your point, you really shouldn't<br>
expect anyone to lend any credence to what you say. This list is meant<br>
for serious discussion, not outlandish claims. Just because we talk<br>
about things like quantum logic processors, plasma computers, borganic<br>
augmentation, and "jupiter brains", the only time you will see people on<br>
this list talking in a manner anything like mysticism is when people<br>
talk about what the Singularity will be like, which is oxymoronic since<br>
if it were a singularity, then it will be unlike anything we can even<br>
think about or imagine. That is about the only tolerated subject here<br>
that borders on mysticism or religion, and only because it is so far out<br>
there that it is impossible to know about it, but it is a relevant<br>
subject. <br>
<p>
If you still want to discuss your theories of these other phenomenon, I<br>
would suggest that you try the Wierd Science mail list. Its been pretty<br>
quiet for a while now and could use somebody to spark it up.<br>
