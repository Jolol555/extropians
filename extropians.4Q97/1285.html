<i>&gt; &gt; I just skimmed Penrose's book, but my impression is that he claims that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mathematicians have an instinctive ability to recognize mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; truth.  Machines, which are deterministic computer programs and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can be in principle be described as formal systems, are limited by Godel's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; theorem and are unable to recognize certain truths.  Since people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (according to Penrose) unlimited in their ability to recognize mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; proof, this would mean that they are not formal systems and therefore no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; machine can do mathematics in the way a person does.  (And hence, among</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other things, uploading and AI are impossible.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't adding random input to machine make Penrose's argument about</i><br>
<i>&gt; Godel's theorem irrelevant?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe so - but it is conceding too much, from the point of view of a<br>
believer in uploading and AI.  It should not be necessary to add a true<br>
random number generator to a machine in order to make it capable of<br>
consious thought.  To the extent that some randomness is needed, then<br>
an algorithmic pseudo random number generator ought to be good enough.<br>
Believing otherwise is tantamount to believing in Penrose's mysticism<br>
regarding the non-algorithmic capabilities of minds.<br>
<p>
There are pseudo random number generators which are believed to be<br>
indistinguishable from true random number generators even with all the<br>
computing power in the entire universe (by some definition).  Yet adding<br>
such a PRNG to an AI or upload preserves the fact that it is a formal<br>
system, and is still susceptable to Penrose's Godelian argument.  If only<br>
true random number generators can escape Godel and become conscious, then<br>
there must be some way of telling them apart from these simulations, which<br>
would go beyond known algorithmic capabilities.  There would have to be<br>
something magical going on.<br>
<p>
Penrose's argument is weak enough IMO that it should be fought on its<br>
own grounds.  We accept that machines have limitations; the absurdity is<br>
the claim that humans have none.  (Keep in mind my repeated disclaimer<br>
not to have a deep understanding of his argument.)<br>
