The lower the f-ratio the shallower the depth of focus, that is, the more <br>
nonlinear it becomes. This fact is of some importance when dealing with real <br>
light sources that are not mathematical points.<br>
           <br>

I haven't worked out the calculation but my intuition tells me that you'd do <br>
better to forget about the huge ellipsoid and just make your heat radiator <br>
bigger. It's true that a light beam passing through one focus of an ellipsoid <br>
will pass through the other focus too, but it's not necessarily true that a <br>
light beam that passes near one focus will pass near the other one too.<br>
 <br>
It's a little off the subject but this reminds me of something I read a few <br>
years ago about a man who made elliptical pool tables rather than the more <br>
traditional rectangular ones. They were not very popular. The trouble was <br>
that skilled professional players were not much better than rank amateurs at <br>
the game. Chaos took over and nobody had any idea where the billiard balls <br>
would end up when a shot was made. Skill plays no part when a elliptical <br>
table is used, it turns the game into one of chance.<br>
