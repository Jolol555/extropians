It's clear that if this is a canonical Hot Big Bang universe, then at some<br>
time (at least) space expanded faster than the interactions it contained,<br>
otherwise it would still be clogged with monstrously hot quark soup or<br>
something even less appetizing.<br>
<p>
I was rather impressed by Layzer's popularisation COSMOGENESIS, BTW.<br>
Here's what I wrote about it in 1991 (after briefly discussing THE MATTER<br>
MYTH by Gribbin &amp; Davies):<br>
<p>
=====================<br>
<p>
COSMOGENESIS<br>
The Growth of Order in the Universe<br>
by David Layzer<br>
Oxford University Press, 322pp, Index, $20.95<br>
<p>
A very much more impressive attempt to construct a working model of the<br>
universe that is neither simple-mindedly mechanistic nor dismally mystical,<br>
Layzer's ambitious book is frankly a hard read, but a worthy one.  True,<br>
some of its key claims and bold conjectures seem already out of date.<br>
Science is the perfect consumer item, endlessly shifting last year's stock<br>
into the junkyard.  Still, following this distinguished Harvard<br>
astrophysicist on his intellectual journey from the Big Bang to the nature<br>
of brain and consciousness proves that to travel hopefully is better (and<br>
more stimulating) than to arrive.<br>
<p>
`Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is a vast amount of genuine,<br>
irreducible randomness in the world.'  But quantum processes, inherently<br>
indeterminate, are not thereby more `creative' (an argument that should<br>
give Davies and Gribbin pause). `The outcomes of self-creation are new and<br>
unforeseeable, yet coherent with what has gone before.'<br>
<p>
To fans of Big Science, Layzer offers one stunning challenge after another.<br>
 The standard story of creation has a highly ordered fireball Big Bang,<br>
inflating instantly to a smooth expanding cosmos - and can't easily explain<br>
why galaxies clump into vast walls hugging cosmic bubbles.  Layzer proposes<br>
a highly random cold origin, distinctly unfashionable but intriguing.  <br>
<p>
Nothing daunted, he applies his theory to evolution - `beta genes', he<br>
suggests, both provoke and edit mutations, spurring development - and to<br>
the nature of language.  Ultimately, order emerges in hierarchies of<br>
self-organisation, attributable in the final instance to the very expansion<br>
of spacetime itself.<br>
<p>
=================<br>
<p>
And while I'm here - I probably won't be posting any more once the proposed<br>
new rules come into play, because I don't wish to join ExI.  Thanks for all<br>
the fish.<br>
