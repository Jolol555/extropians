In my perception, the Big Bang theory is not at all unscientific. On <br>
the contrary, it is mainstream physical cosmology. It is true that <br>
some people (not only religious people) have disputed the evidence <br>
for the big bang theory, but the same can be said about practically <br>
every sceintific theory, and the received wisdom is that Big Bang <br>
cosmology it is not only scientific, testable and physically <br>
possible, but also very likely true, at least as an approximate <br>
description of what happened to the observable part of the universe.<br>

I have never heard or read any logical positivist claiming this. And <br>
I can't guess where the figure 5000 lyrs comes from: if we can be <br>
said to see stars that are 5000 lyrs away, we can surely be said so <br>
see galaxies that are many millions of lyrs away also.<br>

The problem is not only that our views change, but also that we <br>
disagree with each other about a lot of things. I'm not sure that <br>
transhumanism needs a "bible", though it would surely be useful to <br>
have anthologies of texts we regard as important, and to have good <br>
introductions, overviews, history-primers, bibliographies, <br>
dictionaries, and web resource pages, both for people new <br>
to the field and for those who have been around for a while.<br>
