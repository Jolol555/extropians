<i>&gt; Good grief, Michael, any fool can tell you that earning money</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't what the gummint is for.  Where's the return on investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; in public goods?  Nowhere, because the provider of public goods</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't *get paid* !  That's *why* (in theory) we pay taxes, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; fund such things!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now maybe you mean that if the state spends wisely, the economy</i><br>
<i>&gt; will grow, and tax revenues will grow.  If that's what you meant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; do say it more explicitly, because I almost missed it.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry. I thought that it was implicit that since governments do not<br>
operate on a profit/loss basis, the quality/productivity motive is not<br>
there, but that is neither here nor there. I was assuming two possible<br>
scenarios: a) where government is socialist and runs nationalized<br>
companies, which require capital investements to modernize, expand, etc.<br>
just like any business, and b) where government is more laissez faire,<br>
private businesses are competing in the market with nationalized company<br>
A, and compete in the money markets for investment capital. In this<br>
situation, the nationalized company issues government backed tax free<br>
bonds, while private company B simply issues stock, capital gains on<br>
which is taxed. If socialized government business was so much better,<br>
then obviously it would be able to provide a higher rate of return on<br>
invenstment to purchasers of its bonds, without having to offer tax-free<br>
status to the gains. Since not socialized companies have ever done this,<br>
then this is an obvious financial yardstick to show that private<br>
business is more successful than private business.<br>
<p>
We don't even need to look at different countries. We can simply look at<br>
a comparison between the United States Postal Service and companies like<br>
UPS, FedEx, Airborne, etc.<br>
<p>
This case study is also a good comparison to show that labor also does<br>
better under private enterprise than government socialism. UPS has the<br>
highest wages for almost all of its regular part and full time<br>
positions, while the USPS's jobs rank in the lower half, in a comparison<br>
of employees in the postal/parcel delivery industries. This was BEFORE<br>
the latest strike. WOrkers at the post office can't go on strike due to<br>
government regulations. Hmmmm, what seems to be wrong here?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : In terms of how well consumers are treated by product or service</i><br>
<i>&gt; : providers, perhaps we can use yardsticks like:</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a) what is the relative accident rate in automobiles between the US and</i><br>
<i>&gt; : former Soviet Union (in accidents/fatalities per vehicle)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         [etc]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : Some other questions to ask:</i><br>
<i>&gt; :</i><br>
<i>&gt; : How many people have been shot and killed in their beds</i><br>
<i>&gt; : by hit squads hired by the mom and pop store down the street</i><br>
<i>&gt; : (including New York City, I'll be daring)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hm, there ought to be a story in that.  Perhaps a black-comic</i><br>
<i>&gt; movie, in the vein of "No Way To Treat A Lady".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I'll bet even including organized crime hits (mafioso), the government<br>
law enforcement agencies still kills far more law abiding citizens than<br>
by private organizations. Criminals tend to kill other criminals,<br>
especially when it is concerning any type of organized crime. Cops don't<br>
seem to care who they shoot, so long as they aren't be shot back at.<br>
