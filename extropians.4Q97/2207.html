Thanks for al the replies you've sent us! <br>
We have started our selection proces and will start screening names with<br>
the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in a few days. As soon as we have made our<br>
final choice the winner of a $100 Electroninc gift certificate from Amazon<br>
Books.<br>
<p>
During the next daysWe'll change the name of our site, the URL, the logo<br>
(somewhat), register the new Transhumanist Society and start actively<br>
promoting our organisation.<br>
<p>
In spite of having not sought the media untill now we've already received<br>
several invitations for TV-appearances, radio and a series of interviews by<br>
a cultural magazine 'DutcH'. The latter was started last saturday when we<br>
discussed our ideas with a journalist for several hours (great fun for<br>
everyone involved!). When we get a draft of the article I'll make a<br>
translation and post it to the list, problably the journalists will also<br>
have a look at the ExI-site, Homo Excelsior and Aleph.<br>
<p>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
Arjen<br>
