<i>&gt;&gt; [A discussion of the words "morality" and "ethics"]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have enough faults -- please don't attribute ones I don't have out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; frustration at other people having them, OK?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have no idea what you mean here--which is the only minor "fault" I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was trying to express: that your use of language could be better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What fault did you think I was implying?  Perhaps my language wasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear enough there either, but I just reread my message, and I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;see anything in it that can be interpreted as implying fault.  I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking about words, nothing more, and I thought I was very clear.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I was taking your comments personally.  I didn't notice that they weren't<br>
personal at the time, but I did recognize that I was in suboptimal form,<br>
thus my disclaimer:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Kennita (in a fit of pique -- one of the three QA engineers I lead quit</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;          yesterday with 0 days notice and I'm still recovering)</i><br>
<p>
I am an emotional being, and have ceased to apologize for it (part of my<br>
Objectivism Recovery phase of a few years ago).  I do, however, apologize<br>
for counterattacking if you weren't attacking to begin with.  I saw you<br>
as holding a definition joust with me when I wasn't making any claims<br>
about definitions.<br>
<p>
Whatever.  Water under the bridge, and I'm sleepy -- I think I'll<br>
drift downstream to sleep.<br>
<p>
