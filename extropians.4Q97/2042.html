This reminds me of the role of Jainism and Buddhism in classical India.<br>
They provided a spiritual outlet for the monied merchant caste which was<br>
excluded from the mutual back-scratching rituals of the Kshatriyas and<br>
Brahmins. <br>

<p>
There is no such thing as an ideographic script; this is a fiction<br>
lingering from the first days of Jesuit missionary activity in China and<br>
before Egyptian hieroglyphs were decipherd.  Written Chinese is a<br>
logosyllabary: characters represent phonetic information --syllables--<br>
first and foremost.  Syllabic content is modified by determiners, little<br>
marks added to the syllable-character to indicate something of its<br>
semantic value.  Finally, a small percentage of characters in common use <br>
are true logographs, having purely semantic value and no phonetic value,<br>
similar to Arabic numerals.  Classical Chinese dictionaries are full of<br>
archaic characters which no one knows how to pronounce anymore --these are<br>
logographs that have either passed from common use or were never commonly<br>
used in the first place.<br>
<p>
All writing systems have a phonetic basis because the phonology of a<br>
language is the system with the smallest number of units.  English has<br>
about 42 phonemes; Japanese has IIRC about 120 possible syllables.  20 to<br>
a few hundred functional units are about all anyone can reasonably be<br>
expected to learn.  Semantic systems, on the other hand, contain an<br>
indefinite number of meanings.  Can a human learn an indefinite number of<br>
characters in a few years?<br>

<p>
Having said all that, I seem to recall that there are three levels of<br>
literacy.  At the first level, the reader reductively sounds out each<br>
unit, whether letter or syllable.  ("Kuh... ah... tuh... cat!")<br>
<p>
At the second level, the reader reads the whole word phonetically.  This<br>
is as far as almost anyone got in the ancient Mediterranean world or<br>
medieval Europe --people read aloud and literally listened to what they<br>
were saying.  The ability to read silently was almost unheard of; Saint<br>
Augustine was famous for being able to read without speaking.<br>
<p>
The third level is where most people end up now.  At this point, all<br>
writing systems effectively become ideographic in that the marks on the<br>
page are perceived as a unit; we recognize the shape and do not read the<br>
word phonetically (break it down by syllable or letter) except in the case<br>
of words new to the reader.  The whole word isn't even needed; try<br>
covering up the bottom half of the letters in some text, or reading only<br>
the first few letters.  To get to this point, though, one needs to go<br>
through the previous stages of analyzing writing in terms of phonology.<br>
