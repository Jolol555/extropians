<i>&gt;&gt;Now, back to the original question, which copy is you?  I think the problem</i><br>
people have with this question is the word "You".  We continue to follow that<br>
"self-identity related to a single body" concept when thinking of words<br>
"You",<br>
"I", "Me", etc.  That concept is no longer tenable in this situation.  The<br>
answer in my opinion is that BOTH copies are "You".  Copy A is what you would<br>
be like after spending a year in NYC, Copy B is what you would be like after<br>
spending a year touring Mongolia.  Both experiences would appear to be<br>
equally<br>
valid, meaning Copy A is not a "better" approximation of you and Copy B is.&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
   If we follow someone like Dan Dennett's theory(that there is no Cartesian<br>
"I")<br>
then perhaps neither copy is "you" because there was no "you" in the first<br>
place.<br>
   Perhaps each physical entity would continue to persue it's goals and<br>
desires while philosophically the question of a Cartesian "I" becomes<br>
meaningless--like the concept of "God" or "The beginning of time".<br>
