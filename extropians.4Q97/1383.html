<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The centerpiece of the Senate bill aims to curb the flow of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; estimated 300,000 foreigners who enter the United States illegally or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; overstay their visas each year, and to make it more difficult for</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, that article is not up to date, and only  includes</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegals who are caught and deported. The INS just reported a record</i><br>
<i>&gt; 360,000 deportations this year. It is estimated that there is an annual</i><br>
<i>&gt; influx of between 600k to 1.5 mill a year, but it is hard to track</i><br>
<i>&gt; because there is so much seasonal traffic.</i><br>
<p>
Do you have a source for these estimates?  How credible are they?<br>
<p>
My quotes were from figures used to justify a bill to crack down on<br>
immigration.  They were not numbers of people caught and deported, they<br>
were estimates of illegal immigration (presumably meaning the people who<br>
were _not_ caught and deported).  Supporters of this legislation would<br>
not have any incentive to minimize the figures.  And this was only a<br>
year ago, so it can't be that far out of date.<br>
<p>
The number of deportations in a year does not tell you the number of<br>
illegal immigrants in that year.  Some people may be deported multiple<br>
times.  Some deportees are people who entered in previous years.<br>
There is no direct connection between the two figures.<br>
<p>
This value of 360,000 deportations a year doesn't seem to match what I<br>
am finding on the web:<br>
<p>
INS statistical yearbook, 1994:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Each year the Border Patrol is making more than a million apprehensions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of persons who flagrantly violate our nation's laws by unlawfully crossing</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. borders...</i><br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.fairus.org/03203603.htm:">http://www.fairus.org/03203603.htm:</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As an indication of the growing magnitude of the problem, the annual</i><br>
<i>&gt; apprehension of undocumented aliens by the Department of Justice's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) increased from 505,949 in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1972, the first year legislation aimed at controlling illegal immigration</i><br>
<i>&gt; received House action, to 1,767,400 in 1986. In 1987, after the adoption</i><br>
<i>&gt; of IRCA, INS apprehensions dropped by a third to 1,190,488.</i><br>
<p>
I found another reference to the number of illegals, from the Cato institute:<br>
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-imsum.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-imsum.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The rate of illegal immigration is agreed by all experts to be about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 250,000 to 300,000 per year.</i><br>
<p>
This seems consistent with the figures used by the Senate to justify their<br>
bill.<br>
