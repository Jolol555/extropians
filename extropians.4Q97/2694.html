Dear Friends,<br>
<p>
<p>
In general, the article "Amerika, Amerika" by Claire Wolfe,<br>
despite some mistakes of fact, does indeed make me wonder<br>
about the future of legislative procedure in America and<br>
the direction of human rights in an increasingly<br>
electronicized and instantaneous, omnipresent "world<br>
order" system where one's total official "file" can be<br>
available at the push of a button and where the individual<br>
has less and less control over the accuracy of the file and<br>
less and less ability to rectify the errors it may contain.<br>
<p>
Futurists have long been telling us that trends in the<br>
control and distribution of information make it a sure bet<br>
that one of the great human rights battles of the next<br>
decades will be over privacy and citizen access to<br>
information stored about themselves and their ability to<br>
correct false information.  I am rather new to this forum,<br>
so my question is, what do extropians see of a hopeful,<br>
positive nature in terms of coping with the privacy issue?<br>
<p>
	Sincerely,<br>
<p>
	John Dale<br>

AMERIKA, AMERIKA<br>
<p>
     by Claire Wolfe<br>
<p>
Let me run by you a brief list of items that are "the law"<br>
in America today.  As you read, consider what all these have<br>
in common.<br>
...<br>
<p>
3. Confiscation of assets from any American who establishes<br>
foreign citizenship. <br>
<p>
[The item about confiscation of resources if you establish<br>
a foreign citizenship must be, in my belief, the author's<br>
misunderstanding. It is not a crime to become a citizen of<br>
another country per se, and such an act does not per se<br>
lead to confiscation of one's US properties. -- JD]<br>
<p>
...<br>
     STOPPING RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT<br>
<p>
[How do you stop runaway government? My partial answer is: make sure that there are<br>
provisions for direct democracy in every state and at the<br>
federal level. Many states, and the national level in United<br>
States, still lack direct democratic procedures. The powers<br>
of referendum, initiative, and recall are vital, IMO, to be<br>
able to redirect and check runaway governance if<br>
things get to that point. Another way may be to allow the Supreme<br>
Court to issue advisory opinions, in the manner of the<br>
International Court of Justice, regarding the<br>
constitutionality of a law before passage of the law and<br>
before actual damages may start happening to people. The<br>
requirement that there be a claim for actual damages before<br>
the constitutionality of a law can be tested seems to me to<br>
be outdated and harmful. Surely there can be some way of<br>
using an ounce of prevention to bypass a pound of cure.<br>
--JD]<br>
<p>
... Face it.  If  "working within the system" could halt<br>
tyranny, the tyrants would outlaw it.  Why do you  think<br>
they encourage you to vote, to write letters, to talk to<br>
them in public forums?  It's to divert your energies.  To<br>
keep you tame.  'The system" as it presently exists is<br>
nothing but a rat maze.  You run around thinking you're<br>
getting somewhere. Your masters occasionally reward you<br>
with a little  pellet that encourages you to believe you're<br>
accomplishing something.  And in the meantime, you are as<br>
much their property and their pawn as if you were a slave. <br>
In the effort of fighting them on their terms and with<br>
their authorized and approved tools, you have given your<br>
life's energy to them as surely as if you were toiling in<br>
their cotton fields, under the lash of their overseer. The<br>
only way we're going to get off this road to Hell is if we<br>
jump off.  If we, personally, as individuals, refuse to<br>
cooperate with evil.  How we do that is up to each of us. <br>
I can't decide for you, nor you for me.   <br>
<p>
... But this totalitarian runaway  truck [Is Claire Wolfe <br>
is living in the US or in North Korea? -- JD] is never going to<br>
stop unless we stop it, in any way we can. Stopping it might<br>
include any  number of things: tax resistance; public civil<br>
disobedience; wide-scale, silent non-cooperation; highly<br>
noisy non-cooperation; boycotts; secession efforts; monkey<br>
wrenching; computer hacking; dirty tricks against government<br>
agents; public shunning of employees of abusive government<br>
agencies; alternative, self-sufficient communities that<br>
provide their own medical care and utilities. <br>
<p>
[IMO, all the above types of response accomplish is to<br>
provide fodder and incentive for the system to clamp down<br>
tighter. There's got to be a more synergistic way. JD]<br>
