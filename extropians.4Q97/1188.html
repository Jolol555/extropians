I considered this question myself and after reviewing Ander's identity calculus<br>
paper I believe we have some of the same ideas.  However, for those of you<br>
unwilling or unable to navigate Ander's mathematical arguments, here's a more<br>
simplistic rendering.  Note:  This is my own version which may or may not agree<br>
with Ander's work in its entirety.<br>
<p>
Given that a person's mind is uploaded then what you actually have is a<br>
snapshot of that person, not the person itself.  However, the person someone is<br>
is the result of a process.  The process is the person navigating through<br>
his/her experiences in life.  Those experiences, more importantly the reactions<br>
the person formulates to those experiences, shape the person.  The concept of<br>
personal identity has been generally attributed to the individual person<br>
because a more profound or articulate definition has not been needed.<br>
<p>
When a person's mind is uploaded and then "copied" or "downloaded" to two<br>
separate forms, you now have a situation almost entirely alien to human<br>
experience.  You now have two people with initially the same "mind" now able to<br>
go off and have totally separate and different experiences.  The result of this<br>
incongruity of experiences between the two means two different people will<br>
result, perhaps not vastly different people but if you then compared their<br>
minds there would be inconsistencies.<br>
<p>
The big question is if you were the person initially uploaded and subsequently<br>
downloaded into two different copies, which one would you be after a year's<br>
time?  My view?  It's not easily answered.  If Copy A went to China and Copy B<br>
went to New York City, odds are each would have vastly different day-today<br>
experiences.  Thus, these different experiences would influence different<br>
aspects of the original mind (the one initially uploaded) in different ways.<br>
What if Copy B experienced a hard life while trying to attend college in NYC<br>
where it was exposed to the starkness of city life and maybe even violently<br>
robbed or attacked  while Copy A spent its time travelling the rural villages<br>
of Mongolia and learning more of their culture.  Copy B might emerge a ruder,<br>
more paranoid, more pessimistic person while Copy A might emerge more tolerant<br>
of people's differences and more benevolent.<br>
<p>
Now, back to the original question, which copy is you?  I think the problem<br>
people have with this question is the word "You".  We continue to follow that<br>
"self-identity related to a single body" concept when thinking of words "You",<br>
"I", "Me", etc.  That concept is no longer tenable in this situation.  The<br>
answer in my opinion is that BOTH copies are "You".  Copy A is what you would<br>
be like after spending a year in NYC, Copy B is what you would be like after<br>
spending a year touring Mongolia.  Both experiences would appear to be equally<br>
valid, meaning Copy A is not a "better" approximation of you and Copy B is.<br>
<p>
Permutations:  An interesting idea would be for a third copy of you to be made<br>
using the original uploaded mind.  This Copy C could then "interview" Copy A<br>
and Copy B and determine which one he/she (Copy C that is) liked better.  If<br>
Copy C chose Copy A, then Copy C would have its mind "updated" with Copy A's<br>
mind and Copy B could be "dealt with".  I use the phrase "dealt with" because<br>
determining the rights a copy has is going to be a very interesting issue for<br>
the legal systems of the future.  Is Copy B an experiment owned by Copy C to be<br>
disposed of as Copy C wishes?  Or does Copy B's existence as a human give it<br>
certain sovereign rights independent of the original mind?  Maybe I'll discuss<br>
my thoughts on that at a later date.<br>
