In a message dated 97-10-02 21:23:34 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Why not?  The anarchists would claim that any system which sanctions<br>
 such inequities among human beings is unacceptable.  That holding but<br>
 not using resources which other people could use is theft, and<br>
 inefficient.  If you're not using the building how is someone else<br>
 moving into it theft?  How is it unjust? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't follow that...I have nothing against inequities...in fact I beleive<br>
equality of outcome is a farce...a myth perpetuated by "do-gooder liberals"<br>
as an excuse to acquire and use force over others...<br>
<p>
Equality of opportunity is a different thing...although even it isn't a<br>
guarantee...<br>
<p>
If a person owns something....it's no business of yours what he does with<br>
it...whether you think it fair...or not...and just because you disapprove in<br>
no way makes his use of his own property "theft"<br>
<p>
<p>
My retort to people who make such an argument " If you're not using the<br>
building how is someone else<br>
 moving into it theft? " is that it's MINE...and if you don't like it...get<br>
off your dead ass and earn your own...I've done it...starting from ground<br>
zero...twice...and I don't see why others can't as well...<br>
<p>
And I was just this very minute talking to a guy...he saw me sitting at the<br>
table with my laptop...he didn't know what it was...he didn't know what I was<br>
doing...he claimed not to know how to read or wite...and yet he owns two<br>
trucks...and is buying three more...so he must be having some success (he was<br>
a "minority'" by the way...one of those poor downtrodden by the evil white<br>
man mexicans)  So I don't have any pity for the helpless homeless...if I can<br>
and this guy can...then THEY can .<br>
<p>
Sorry for the vehemance...but theft...and the legitimazation of<br>
theft...aggravates me.<br>
