<p>
Its good to see some people can actually reach conclusions. Here are<br>
some more to think about:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks for everyone who's contributed to my understanding. I've still</i><br>
<i>&gt; got a few devil's</i><br>
<i>&gt; advocate caveats I'm happy to be talked out of:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. I agree that the still-burgeoning, information-based economy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fostering the profitability</i><br>
<i>&gt; of libertarian-style models. But I suspect that (a) the cost/benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; ratio of dominating</i><br>
<i>&gt; others will always be more attractive than self-suffiency to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; minority of persons willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use coercion, </i><br>
<p>
coercion is more cost effective for short term profit taking, but<br>
negative for long term profit taking in an economy of informed<br>
consumers. If someone gets the word out that company A, individual B or<br>
PPL C is a completely crooked nogoodnik, the negative PR will in the<br>
long run, if the coercion continues toward enough people, become a "bad<br>
thing" for the profitability of A, B, or C. Any libertarian system<br>
requires a certain level of communication freedom to allow the market to<br>
receive and transmit accurate signals, as well as a minimum percentage<br>
of participants having a concious idea of the difference between their<br>
perceived self interest and their real rational long term self interest<br>
(which can often be rather counter-intuitive), basically the market has<br>
to have a minimum level of average intelligence. As intelligence<br>
amplification occurs over time with the singularity, the point of<br>
economic equilibrium will drift toward libertarianism.<br>
<p>
(b) most people will succumb to governance over<br>
<i>&gt; self-rule (if handled correctly),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and (c) the greater the % of population willing to be governed, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more difficult it is for</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who do not wish to be governed to retain autonomy.</i><br>
<p>
Self governance is avoided by most people because it currently is too<br>
labor intensive, as compared to the alternative services currently<br>
offered by state organizations. With the development of technologies<br>
that make self governance less labor intensive, or that increase<br>
individual productivity, giving them more time to devote to self<br>
governance, people will tend to demand more and more self governance.<br>
Those state organizations which fail to meet this market demand will be<br>
revolted against, voted out of office, or disbanded.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Therefore, I submit that although libertarianism will advance to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree, it will never fully</i><br>
<i>&gt; replace current systems of government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Hypothetically, if coercive government did disappear completely,</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't power-mongers just</i><br>
<i>&gt; switch their mechanism from coercion to persuasion? John Clark noted</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Germans probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't have attempted genocide against the Jews en masse without the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazi military machine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But would a Nazi propoganda machine have been equally effective? </i><br>
<p>
If a government is nothing more than a propaganda machine, then it in<br>
effect is little more than a tourist attraction. I would not call Nazi<br>
Germany a particularly attractive tourist attraction, though I imagine<br>
the spa set would probably feel right at home... ;)<br>
<p>
It's<br>
<i>&gt; my understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a large percentage of the American population believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare recipients are</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for much of the country's ills, but have no idea that USA</i><br>
<i>&gt; spends 150 billion/year</i><br>
<i>&gt; on corporate welfare. Isn't that governance by persuasion rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion? </i><br>
<p>
When a corporation is told by a government that it is only going to<br>
confiscate half of what the government thinks it owes, then that is<br>
merely a reduction in government theft, not an increase in welfare for<br>
the corporation. Whose money is it anyways? The corporation earned it. <br>
Welfare is when a group or individual gets more back from the government<br>
than it puts in in taxes, not when the amount of government confiscation<br>
is merely reduced. You've bought into one of the Great Lies of liberal<br>
governance.<br>
<p>
The vast majority of our present total federal debt is, in fact, due to<br>
increases in domestic spending, mostly in entitlement growth. Liberals<br>
would have you beleive that the $6 trillion was all spent on defense.<br>
Since $5 trillion of that was racked up between 1980 and the present<br>
day, that means that we must have been spending almost $300 billion<br>
every year since that time on defense. SInce the real numbers show that<br>
this is not the case, that the only time the defense budget was as high<br>
as that was in 1985, and that since then the defense budget has<br>
decreased by half, while the entitlement budget has tripled, that<br>
entitlements are responsible for a greater share of government debt.<br>
<p>
And although<br>
<i>&gt; I'd like to believe that the only factor influencing the market value</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my work is the work</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself, I'm fully aware that public perception of my race, gender,</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual preference, education,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc., are extremely influential. If any body can control the factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; that set the prices for</i><br>
<i>&gt; my work, does it really matter that they use persuasion rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion? </i><br>
<p>
Well, as a single white straight male veteran with no dependents, I<br>
can't collect welfare, unemployment, get vocational rehabilitation, win<br>
a suit an employer for wrongful dismissal, or even collect on the<br>
veterans benefits I worked for unless I figure out some con to become<br>
part of a group that has been wronged in some way.<br>
<p>
Last year between jobs I tried everywhich way to get any kind of<br>
benefits, just for experiments sake. In the 14 years I've been in the<br>
workforce, I estimate I've contributed around $50,000 to the system yet<br>
have not received one penny back in a direct payment. Now, I wouldn't<br>
mind it if I could specify what services I wanted and what I didn't. I<br>
could specify all of my taxes go to defense and into government debt,<br>
and I wouldn't mind at all not getting anything back but those two<br>
services. But the claims that all of these taxes are for services I am<br>
entitled to when I've found that they always have a loophole to exclude<br>
me tells me that the government is the biggest bigot of all.<br>
<p>
When I tried to leave out all data pertaining to my race, gender, etc. I<br>
was told that I couln't receive benefits if I didn't give that<br>
information, yet I can easily get by in a job application without such<br>
info.<br>
<p>
Is it only<br>
<i>&gt; an ethical victory, or is there something I'm not seeing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's the libertarian position on this? That population control</i><br>
<i>&gt; through media, while sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfortunate, is not unethical?</i><br>
<p>
If you are willing to expose yourself to media, you get what you pay<br>
for. On the other hand, you should be able to choose what sort of media<br>
to can be exposed to. The Orwellian perpetual wallscreen is not my idea<br>
of freedom of expression.<br>
