<p>
Who gauged these "major" changes? When were they measured? Where were the samples<br>
drawn? What methodology was applied? Which controls were established? How did the<br>
researchers document the state of nitrogen in the atmosphere before these<br>
supposed major changes happened, in order to determine the differential in change<br>
rate? In what manner could a rational being find this reseach, in order to study<br>
the thesis?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  All major food crops have been substantially altered from their origins</i><br>
<p>
One would only expect that much efficiency from agricultural science. To mention<br>
a single historical case, the Incas succeeded in harvesting potatoes from scrawny<br>
wild tubers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; some so completely we're not entirely sure what the origins are.</i><br>
<p>
Chemical analysis can trace the origin and composition of any substance,<br>
including foods. And if we couldn't be entirely sure what the origins were, how<br>
could we possibly relate them to major food crops, which have mostly been with us<br>
for centuries, when not millennia?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  When the natural world fails to provide</i><br>
<p>
What has the natural world failed to provide? What natural event does no longer<br>
take place in the natural world?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; we can and do change the world.</i><br>
<p>
So does every phenomenon over the globe, be it rational, biological, chemical or<br>
physical. Unlike the latter three, however, rational phenomena can be regulated<br>
by individual will in order to control the rate of impact upon its environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Rather, it's now the "natural" world which requires the focused effort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; large numbers of humans to maintain it in the face of all the other people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to change it.</i><br>
<p>
The "natural" world lacks any will or reason that would enable it to require<br>
anything from human beings. Rather, it is humans (and other organisms) who lay<br>
claims to the surrounding natural world in order to satisfy their natural somatic<br>
drives and natural reasonings.<br>
<p>
The "natural" world, of which human beings and their activities are an integral<br>
part, is a dynamic system. Regardless of the presence of human beings, the<br>
natural world undergoes continuous changes by dint of its physical dimensions:<br>
space, time, mass and the resultant vectors. Any focused effort by an entity or<br>
collective to preserve a system's status is an essay in entropy, the outright<br>
anathema of every principle cherished by extropians. Indeed, since reason is a<br>
human phenomenon, and humans are a natural phenomenon, and phenomenons are the<br>
dynamic expression of the natural world, any effort to maintain the natural world<br>
in a static condition would be contradictory to the essence of that ever-changing<br>
natural world.<br>
<p>
All the other people who want to change the world are known as living human<br>
beings. They are actually performing what comes natural to them.<br>
