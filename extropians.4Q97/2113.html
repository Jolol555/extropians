Read carefully.  Max was not disavowing mailing lists in general.  He<br>
was saying what this particular list was founded for.  That founder said<br>
so in July, having been gone for a long time.  After a short while I<br>
think he left again.<br>

<p>
That's my personal /dev/null, not a list of people ExI bans from posting or<br>
anything.  They were selected because I eventually judged their posts<br>
were more trouble to delete than they were worth.<br>
