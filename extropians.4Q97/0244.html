Ever seen Corel Office for Java?  To be fair, it's still young and it's<br>
getting better all the time.  Besides, I don't think *any* language is suited<br>
to our needs, look at the nasty ugly applications being churned out every<br>
day.  It's time someone did something radical.<br>

IE 3.0 had the same 'feature,' but it could only download the information to<br>
Microsoft (and only when you went on their website), who could then use,<br>
abuse and sell it.<br>
