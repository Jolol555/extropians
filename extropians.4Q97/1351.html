I try to keep up with this stuff, and I am aware that rich countries<br>
are currently not maintiaining their populations solely by reproduction.<br>
The increase in rich countries is by illegal immigration. (This is not<br>
a complaint, it's an obeservation.) However, the poorer countries,<br>
especially in Latin America and in Asia, have rapidly increasing<br>
populations. Even in Africa and even with the AIDS epidemic, the<br>
populations are growing. The trend you mention actually depends on<br>
increasing wealth, which in turn depends on increased technology.<br>
<p>
If the population peaks in 2037 using existing techology with no<br>
advances, it will do so because the average per-capita income reaches<br>
roughly what rich countries consider the poverty level. At this level of<br>
consumption and with no advances in technology, the population will<br>
almost certainly destroy the Earth's ecosystems within 50 years.<br>
<p>
The way out of this mess is to continue to deploy new technology,<br>
which should allow us to reach the per-capita levels of wealth that<br>
correlate with zero population growth a much lower demand on the<br>
ecosystems. Of course, IMO we will actually end up with radical<br>
changes to our civilization which render this entire discussion<br>
irrelevant. For example, If I can use nanotech to establish myself<br>
in space, I will make no further demands on the Earth's ecosystems.<br>
If I can upload copies of myself, or if I joinb with one or more<br>
others to create a composite copy, I have no biological constraint on<br>
reporduction. Much more likely, we will spawn a new civilization based<br>
on superintelligence(s), the results of which are incomprehensible.<br>
