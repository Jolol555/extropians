&lt;&lt; Dear EvMick,<br>
 No, I don't think you need to get out more.<br>
 You seem to get great emotional and intellectual fulfilment<br>
 living your life the way you do.<br>
 As with all lifestyles I'm sure you've found that yours has more than a few<br>
 shortcomings, however. I'm curious as to what you might peceive them to be.<br>
 Quo Vadis???<br>
 <br>
 AMG<br>
<p>
Youre right about the first part..I lead this life cause there's little demand<br>
for  beaver trappers anymore...and I can't find a starship yet...or an<br>
asteroid miner (I"m looking!!)<br>
<p>
Regarding the second part...shortcomings....<br>
<p>
Thought about that for a little while...and I assume you mean PARTICULAR<br>
shortcomings...unique to my lifestyle....and I can't come up with<br>
any...nothing that the nomadic tribes of the steppes or the horsetribes of the<br>
great plains would see as a problem...or even today's elderly<br>
"snowbirds".....just a nomadic lifestyle...strike "camp" every morning....find<br>
a new one every nite...and anything left behind is gone forever...an<br>
increasingly HI TECH lifestyle....and it's getting easier all the time...<br>
<p>
I just recently...no more than a couple of months ago...purchased a new<br>
rig.&lt;brag mode...ON&gt;  She's a 1995 LongNose Peterbilt...300 in wheelbase...90<br>
in custom sleeper...470 hp...18 speed...She's so strong she'll "loaf" at 75<br>
mph turning 1500 rpm on the flats grossing 80,000 lbs...and will barely notice<br>
any but the most significant hill.  I have a refrigerator, TV and VCR<br>
builtin...with more to come as I decide what I need.Climate Control, Cellular<br>
telephone ,LapTop Computer and GPS navigation... &lt;brag mode...OFF&gt;<br>
<p>
Like a turtle..I carry my home with me..<br>
<p>
My biggest problem...and I'm sure you can guess what's coming...is government<br>
meddling...but that's no different from everyone else's...it's just a little<br>
more visible in my profession.<br>
<p>
Course....there's the loneliness...but I'm not as subject to that as most<br>
folks...and I've found that people can be lonely in crowds...city folk are<br>
perhaps more lonely than ranchers...and email and the internet is making a big<br>
dent in that problem..<br>
<p>
<p>
And I don't know what Quo Vadis means.<br>
