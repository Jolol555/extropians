I was under the impression that such travel would be impossible due to the fact that<br>
wormholes tend to collapse as soon as they form. However, I was speaking with a friend<br>
a while back, and he brought up the subject of Kerr (sp?) black holes. It seems that<br>
these are theoretical black holes in which the singularity is larger than a<br>
mathematical point, elongated perpendicular to an axis of rotation. Some physicists<br>
seem to think that that this singularity may be ring-shaped. If so, this would mean<br>
that one could follow the axis of rotation into the very center, supposedly "passing<br>
through" the singularity (which if I am not mistaken would have the properties of a<br>
wormhole/gravity well).<br>
<p>
If it were possible to begin a normal (Schwarzchild) black hole rotating, would one be<br>
able to create such a ring-shaped singularity? Theoretically, this would eliminate the<br>
problem of wormhole collapse since the centrifugal force of rotation would keep it<br>
wide open. Of course, travelling through it would be an entirely different matter...<br>
