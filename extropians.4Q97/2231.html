<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the same. Someone on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead but can't tell whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's something solid or just a slight thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge, whatever...) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's not going to slow down</i><br>
<i>&gt; because some backseater 'thinks' he sees something. So here we are rushing</i><br>
<i>&gt; toward an object that could be anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall</i><br>
<i>&gt; of concrete. After some discussion the still unclear object is now to close</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a full stop, the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what happens' or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ask the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is' at the lowest speed</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize the damage (if any).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An international panel of scientists have some pretty good theories that</i><br>
<i>&gt; something will happen to the global climate due to the usage of fossile</i><br>
<i>&gt; fuels (the only countries that don't agree with the IPCC-reports are a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; OPEC-members). Increased downward infrared flux trough increased CO2</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration is a well-accepted fact (and maybe a way to terraform Mars</i><br>
<i>&gt; someday). The precise effects on the global climate system cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimated at this point, it may take another 10 to 15 years to find</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusive evidence for (or against) a human-induced climatechange. But: if</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing is done before then it may very well be too late do to anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Given the fact that we have a resonable indication that something is going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to happen that _may_ be very damaging to to the only habitable planet we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have it does not seem unreasonable to try to do something (IMHO).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe we could somehow include the cost of bonding the CO2 again (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; reforrestation) in the price of gasoline or electricity, as an alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; for complex regulation. That way anybody can drive (&amp; fly) as much as</i><br>
<i>&gt; he/she want as long as the true global cost of 'closed-cycle' consumption</i><br>
<i>&gt; is paid. The funds could be used (by oilcompanies?) to plant trees that</i><br>
<i>&gt; will bond atmospheric carbon or put into energy research.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Turns out that as CO2 levels are rising, plant life is naturally<br>
increasing their growth rates, as well as increasing their rates of<br>
carbon bonding/ kilo of plant growth.<br>
<p>
I've also seen simulations by oceanographers at UW a couple years ago<br>
that showed that most of the rise in CO2 levels had much more to do with<br>
the killoff of oceanic plankton in the southern hemisphere, which is<br>
directly and conclusively linked to the chlorine caused ozone hole. As<br>
this ozone hole is now feared to have reached a self sustaining level,<br>
due to the increased cooling in Antarctica (which causes a natural level<br>
of destriction of ozone in the winter), and a smaller but equally<br>
ominous ozone hole above the acrtic circle, which will lead to<br>
additional cooling, leading to additional ozone loss, and so on, it<br>
looks more like while equatorial regions are getting warmer, according<br>
to pro greenhouse theory scientists, the poles are getting colder, which<br>
has yet to receive any media spin, for fear, apparently of thoroughly<br>
confusing the masses.... Could our indiscriminate use of CFCs this<br>
century trigger a new ice age???? Could the threatened thermal expansion<br>
of the oceans, with a concurrent rise in sea levels, be absorbed by an<br>
increase in polar icecap thickness???<br>
