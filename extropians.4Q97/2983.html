Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>

<i>&gt; For much of my life until my late 20s, I was a LeFebvrian</i><br>
<i>&gt; pacifist.  I've never thrown a punch, and I hope I don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to.</i><br>
<p>
      Do yo mean that you were (as I am) an admirer of Bob LeFevre's?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  But I am no longer willing to believe that all lives are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  equally valuable.  My life is worth more than Geoffrey Dahmer's</i><br>
<p>
      Whoaa!!!  We usually use market prices to assess 'valuable' within a <br>
      social context.  If someone rich values Dahmer as a research <br>
      specimen, or as a contract killer, and outbids what a 'hit' on you <br>
      would cost (around $1 000 for a Russian-sourced 'hit' -- lots of <br>
      kids in St. Petersburg said they wanted to be hit-men in a recent <br>
      poll) -- does that mean that Dahmer lives and you die?<br>
      <br>
      Or do you mean a more obscure 'internal' concept of value?  Dahmer <br>
      may think his life is worth more than yours is (to him).  How do you <br>
      suggest we resolve this clash of 'values'?  Of metrics, even?<br>
<p>
<p>
      BTW: The British Government values a 'typical' human life at 180 000 <br>
      UKP.  That's how much they'll -- grudgingly -- spend to save a life <br>
      via road improvements and so on.<br>
<p>
      <br>
<i>&gt; and if I have to end the latter to protect the former, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to do so, and take responsibility for it.  If I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent it from happenning in the first place, that's even</i><br>
<i>&gt; better.  But sometimes we don't get that choice.</i><br>
<p>
      But doesn't that just mean "If it's him or me, it's gonna be him"?  <br>
<p>
      Which hardly adds anything at all to our understanding, since nearly <br>
      everyone on Earth thinks that way (at least where there's some <br>
      social distance involved).<br>
