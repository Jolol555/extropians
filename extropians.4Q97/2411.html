<p>
<i>&gt;What more you could possibly demand of teleportation? </i><br>
<p>
How about being able to duplicate macroscopic objects, including all<br>
the details of the relations between adjacent atoms, molecules, their<br>
temperature, chemical bonds, etc.  None of this *needs* quantum<br>
mechanics, because these properties can be described classically.  You<br>
could argue that we'd need quantum information, but we don't know that,<br>
and it's certainly not obvious.<br>
<p>
I suppose I should clarify that by "quantum state", I mean things like<br>
the spin, which are describable only by quantum mechanics and by no<br>
other branch of physics.  Thus, things like momentum and position and<br>
mass don't qualify, because they can be described classically.<br>
<p>
Another major difference between this "teleportation" and true<br>
teleportation is that, ideally, teleportation would be able to<br>
duplicate the object at the far end *without* the need for raw material<br>
at the other end.  For example, being able to teleport something into<br>
orbit is impossible unless you can build the object from *nothing* at<br>
the far end.  (Well, not *nothing*.  You'd have to get the energy from<br>
somewhere, possibly the vacuum.)  The "teleportation" being discussed<br>
here does nothing of the sort.  It can't dulpicate a molecule, all it<br>
can do is transfer the quantum state of, say, a molecule of H2O to<br>
another H2O molecule far away, but *you need an H2O molecule at the<br>
other end*.  It says nothing about *building* an H2O molecule if all<br>
you have is H and O.  And of course if it's something more complex,<br>
like a brick, then you need a brick at the other end (a *completely<br>
identical* brick, in all respects down to every last atom in every<br>
position, except the quantum state of all its constituent atoms and<br>
molecules), and all this process does is duplicate the quantum state of<br>
the brick.  Big deal.  Do you think the quantum state of the brick is<br>
important?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The quantum state is all there is to say about an object.</i><br>
<p>
I hope I've clarified this above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The exact quantum state of your brain is almost  certainly far more </i><br>
<i>&gt;information than you'd need to duplicate consciousness, but it's definitely  </i><br>
<i>&gt;not irrelevant.               </i><br>
<p>
It may or may not be relevant.  You've made no argument that it is.<br>
Please do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An MRI scanner will change the quantum state of your brain and thus it will </i><br>
<i>&gt;change you</i><br>
<p>
Changing the spin of some of the particles in my brain does not change *me*.<br>
As far as I know, the latest research on how memory works seems to indicate<br>
memories are stored by chemical reactions that re-arrange molecules between<br>
neurons.  The spin of atoms that constitute the molecules is irrelevant.<br>
