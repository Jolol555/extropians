Joao Pedro responds to Geoff Smith's query about priorities:<br>
<p>
:	My world problems? Freedom? Productivity? Are you living in<br>
:	the same planet I live? Do you know that more than 30'000<br>
:	children die each day of avoidable causes?<br>
<p>
Can you tell us how to change that without money?<br>
<p>
:	Do you want to know how much people have died in<br>
:	wars in the last decades?<br>
<p>
Too many, and every one of them was killed by a state<br>
that claimed to be correcting some injustice.<br>
<p>
Is the problem of state aggression<br>
not related to the question of freedom?<br>
<p>
:	Do you know that at least 30% of the<br>
:	world population lives in poverty?<br>
<p>
Do you know how to change that without improving productivity?<br>
Do you know how to improve productivity without the freedom to<br>
experiment with new methods and new products?<br>
<p>
:	I don't know about you but my idea of a good place to live in<br>
:	must first correct this injustices and only then care about<br>
:	tax rates and stockholders.<br>
<p>
You're going to need the cooperation of the taxpayers and<br>
stockholders, whatever you do.  Without it you'll get nowhere.<br>
<p>
:	And that is exactly why I disagree with free-markets, they<br>
:	won't solve any of these problems and they will only work in<br>
:	the direction of the already wealthy (and I mean a lot more<br>
:	wealthier than us, or at least I) while discarding the poor.<br>
<p>
Already wealthy, like the English laborers, whose standard of living<br>
improved steadily (except as interrupted by wars) from about 1800<br>
until recently?<br>
<p>
Already wealthy, like my grandmother's grandparents who left<br>
Scandinavia to seek better prospects in America?  (Maybe they<br>
came to Wisconsin in 1880 to steal land from the Indians)<br>
<p>
:	Obviously (at least for me it's obvious) I cannot agree with<br>
:	such a system that might even create a few more millionaires<br>
:	but will leave the overall world population in poverty.<br>
:	That is not the world I want to leave for the generations<br>
:	to come.<br>
<p>
It is what you'll get, if you blame the creators of wealth,<br>
rather than the political prevention of wealth.<br>
<p>
:	&gt; how do you know when you have found the "truth"?<br>
:	&gt; how do you know when someone is "immediately wrong"?<br>
:	&gt; is it a warm, fuzzy feeling?<br>
:<br>
:	When I (or any other musician) listen to an A chord (a correct<br>
:	A chord, if the guitar is not tuned it is not an A chord), we<br>
:	instinctively recognize it as one (at least if it's played in<br>
:	a guitar or keyboard, I never listened to an A chord when played<br>
:	on some exotic instruments).  If anyone disagrees with us, he is<br>
:	wrong because that is an A chord as defined many centuries ago<br>
:	and accepted till our days by all musicians as an A chord. Is that<br>
:	so hard to understand?<br>
<p>
Not at all.  But you omit one important element.  A chord is recognized<br>
as a chord not only by convention, but because of inherent properties<br>
of the sound it makes, and of our ears.  We don't need perfect pitch<br>
to recognize when notes are played in ratio 4:5:6 (or approximately;<br>
today's conventional tuning actually makes the 5 rather sharp).  A<br>
4:5:6 chord is, by nature, more harmonious than a 21:26:31 chord,<br>
and no convention can make it otherwise.  It does take some learning,<br>
just as you may not like the taste of wine the first time you try it,<br>
but later you learn to appreciate it and distinguish good wine from<br>
bad (and sherry from champagne).<br>
<p>
Similarly, "free market" implies a set of norms that I, like many<br>
others for a thousand years, recognize as justice; not because some<br>
committee of merchants said "This is what we'll call justice," but<br>
because the application of such norms was found - by long informal<br>
experience - to keep the peace better than other norms.<br>
<p>
I'll bet you recognize such norms too, as they are applied to<br>
interactions between two people.  For some reason when you consider<br>
people by the millions, rather than by twos and threes, justice<br>
magically becomes injustice, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way - "chord" to me means three notes, but a guitar has six<br>
strings; when you play "A chord" on a guitar, are the notes A C# E<br>
repeated in another octave?<br>
