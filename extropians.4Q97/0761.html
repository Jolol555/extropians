hi there... <br>
<p>
in a reply to the Gov't NOT Coercion dialogue "K" wrote:<br>

<p>
i think that any review of history of some depth will show that it is<br>
certainly true that "most people will knuckle under rather than go to the<br>
wall"<br>
<p>
but this isn't neccasarily due to ignorance, or even fear... rather, it often<br>
seems to be a case of the individual being to busy staying alive to notice or<br>
care much what is happening 'round him/her until it's too late to do anything<br>
about it...<br>
<p>
i mean to say that my own less than stellar record of protest or resistance<br>
stems more from lack of energy than anything else... by the time you get home<br>
from work and feed the kids and wind the cat and put the clock out and etc.,<br>
etc.... who's got time to draft a letter to every busybody nogoodnik that<br>
deserves one?...<br>
<p>
we all know that freedom takes work to get and to keep... unfortunately it<br>
seems most of us are kept so busy existing we don't have much time or energy<br>
or money left to fight a decent fight...<br>
<p>
any thoughts?..thanks for listening... Fireeye<br>
