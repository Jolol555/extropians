<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; The presently accepted view of what causes the earth's electromagnetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  field is that since the inner core rotates faster than the outer layers</i><br>
<i>&gt;  like the mantle and crust at a rate of about one extra "day" per year of</i><br>

<i>&gt;  the stator, in an electromagnetic generator. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well...now another question arises...why.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's always "why" isn't it?  In this case why does the iron crystal/iron</i><br>
<i>&gt; lattice core rotate at a different rate than the rest of the planet.  I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; see the moon having any effect...gravity would affect the earth equaly</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't it?</i><br>
<p>
No. As lunar tidal influence is a mechanism of the moons gravitational<br>
field, there is an inverse square function at work here. Since the moon<br>
orbits the earth slower than the earth rotates, the gravitational<br>
attraction acts as a brake on this rotation. If you look at distance<br>
from the center of the rotation of the earth as you would as an<br>
increasingly long lever, you would see that the moons tidal influence<br>
produces greater torque on the outer layers of the earth than on the<br>
inner layers. As the core is at the center of rotation there is very<br>
little influence on its rotation, while the molten layers between it and<br>
the outer solids allows for enough lubrication to allow for the<br>
rotational differential, like the slip in a clutch...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an earlier Post I wrote.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And just to throw a nother bean into the stew...how does Gold's Primeval</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oil</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thesis tie into this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And Anders Sandberg replied</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As far as I know, not at all. It is all about what happens up at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;crust, not down in the core.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And Micheal Lorrey also replied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;What the hell is Gold's Primeval Oil thesis?????</i><br>
<i>&gt; w</i><br>
<i>&gt; me again...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know...for sure...but evidently anders is familiar with it...  what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think I  know has to do the the idea that oil is NOT the result of decayed</i><br>
<i>&gt; dinosuars...but rather a part of all asteroids and space junk which fell</i><br>
<i>&gt; together originally (primeval)..and coalesced to form the planet...The guy</i><br>
<i>&gt; who come up with this idea was named Gold...I think...</i><br>
<p>
I'll ask my cousin about it.<br>
