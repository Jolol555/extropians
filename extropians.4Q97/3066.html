There's no need to insult the man -- he's certainly living no more in<br>
a world of his own devising than are most of us.  And if you think<br>
he'll "believe anything", I'm not sure you're reading the same posts<br>
of his that I am.<br>
<p>
Maybe he doesn't intend to have children of his own.  In any case, <br>
I imagine that if he does have them, he won't torture them -- at <br>
least not on purpose.  I consider that my own hyper-rational <br>
upbringing was a torture of its own kind, that manifests itself <br>
occasionally in intellectual bludgeoning (I think I temper it with<br>
politeness and other concessions to people's emotional sides, which<br>
Lee seems to eschew -- which explains a lot).<br>
<p>
Enough for now.<br>
