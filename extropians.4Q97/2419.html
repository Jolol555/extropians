<i>&gt; From:          GBurch1 &lt;GBurch1@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; WIRED magazine has published the results of a fascinating poll of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "wired" community.  The article by Jon Katz and some of the poll</i><br>
<i>&gt; results can be found at</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
In one respect I am already less than impressed with this survey, and <br>
I haven't started reading the results.<br>
<p>
By their definitions I am "semi-connected".<br>
<p>
At work I have two phone lines, voice mail, a pager, an Internet <br>
email address, and two PCs on a network which includes a T1 Internet <br>
connection (and a third PC which I rarely turn on).  I am browsing <br>
the Web (work-related) at least twice a week, and receive an average <br>
of probably 20 emails per working day.  My email is usually running <br>
constantly.  At the end of the workday I get on a bus and RELAX for <br>
forty-five minutes.  Since I am relaxing, I don't want to be working <br>
on a laptop or talking on a cell phone, so I don't have those.<br>
<p>
I go home to a telephone with answering machine, a modem on a <br>
separate line, a different Internet email address, a half-dozen very <br>
active newsgroups (average about 200 new messages per day not <br>
including spam), a couple active Internet mailing lists (average <br>
about 60 emails per day not including spam), a half dozen web sites <br>
that I look in on at least once a week, and another half dozen per <br>
week that are mentioned in the newsgroups or email and I judge worth <br>
checking.<br>
<p>
If that is "semi-connected", then anyone who is actually connected <br>
really should get a life.<br>
<p>
I would have suggested a different standard:<br>
<p>
Count the number of telephones, modems, fax machines, pagers, cell <br>
phones, and answering machines dedicated for your use (including <br>
your family stuff); add one if you *use* some sort of modem pool or <br>
communal high-speed internet connection at least once a week, ditto <br>
for a communal fax machine.  Include voicemail.  If you have a <br>
multiline phone and the lines are dedicated to your use (with no more <br>
than two coworkers, but including your family), count the extra <br>
lines.  Count the email addresses you check at least three times a <br>
week.  Count the web sites or public archives you have maintained in <br>
the last three months.  Count the mailing lists you've subscribed to <br>
that result in at least three emails a week on average.  Count the <br>
web sites you visit at least once a week, and Usenet groups you read <br>
at least twice a week (that actually have non-spam messages that <br>
often), and the Web sites that you visit in a typical week as a <br>
result of receiving the URL in an email or newsgroup message in that <br>
same week..  Add them all up.  Three or fewer is unconnected.  Four <br>
to nine is semi-connected. Ten to twenty-seven, connected.  <br>
Twenty-eight up, super-connected.<br>
<p>
(The exact numbers that define the categories are not essential.)<br>
<p>
By the way, by this standard my count is 30; my 16-year-old <br>
daughter's is 12.<br>
