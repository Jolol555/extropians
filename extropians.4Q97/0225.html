                <br>
<p>
Free will means the inability to predict ones own actions, I don't see the <br>
relevance to objective morality.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>          &gt;(2) the desire to live in society. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Personally I do want to live in society, but I don't see anything unique, <br>
objective, or universal about such a desire.   <br>
    <br>
                           <br>
<i>        &gt;A "society of thieves" is not physically possible, over any great         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;length of time. </i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
For a society to work it's best if certain conventions are followed by most <br>
people most of the time, but these conventions don't form a unique set,  <br>
almost any practice you care to name, I don't care how repugnant, is <br>
considered moral by some culture somewhere. Besides, these conventions are <br>
just practical matters to take into consideration consider if you want to <br>
build a society that works in a certain way, I don't see why they deserve the <br>
lofty  title "Objective Morality" any more than a table listing the amount of <br>
stress a steel beam can take are ethical laws.<br>
<p>
Yet another problem, if "Objective Morality" really is objective then there  <br>
should be some evidence of it in the non human world but we see none. If you <br>
gave me the job of designing the cruelest possible process for producing life <br>
and intelligence I could not come up with anything more horrible than <br>
evolution by random mutation and natural selection.<br>
                           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If one chooses to live in society, one MUST observe certain         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;FUNDAMENTAL rules of conduct.  </i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
To be more precise, if people chooses to live in society most Should observe  <br>
certain FUNDAMENTAL rules of conduct most of the time for the society to work <br>
well. But there is no Objectively Moral reason that a society should work <br>
well, and at any rate, these are just engineering considerations.<br>
<p>
I hope I don't come off sounding too cold hearted in all this, but if <br>
somebody claims to be able to prove OBJECTIVE morality then the game moves <br>
out of the gentle examining room of ethics and religion and into the harsh <br>
no holds barred arena of science, because objective facts is what science is <br>
good at. Like any theory it must be strong enough to survive brutal criticism,  <br>
only the very toughest theories survive in science and I'm afraid objective  <br>
morality is a dead duck.<br>
                           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By definition, the god in your problem has no society, since she is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in an infinitely superior power position. I'll allow that there can         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be no morality for such an infinitely powerful being </i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
I don't understand, how can there be no morality for God if objective morality <br>
exists, or are you saying that God could exist or objective morality could <br>
exist, but not both?<br>

That gives me an idea, suppose you're right and objective morality exists,  <br>
and suppose you go to an alternate universe where it does not, how would  <br>
things be the slightest bit different?<br>
                           <br>

<i>        &gt;Obviously "Objective Humor" isn't being defined as what causes the         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;way.  </i><br>
<p>
Obviously, and for that very reason it's equally obvious to me that whatever <br>
"Objective Humor" is defined to be it should have no interest to you.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Maybe there is such a thing as "Objective Humor"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well maybe objective humor does have a useful meaning, but just suppose it <br>
does not and I could prove it, would you then vow never to laugh again?  <br>
I doubt it, and if I could prove that objective morality did not exist I very <br>
much doubt you would start pushing people into gas chambers.<br>
                           <br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;a joke could be invented which was funny to everyone.  Then if         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;somebody who suffered a massive stroke didn't laugh at that or any         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other joke, we would say that the joke really was funny and the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;person was wrong </i><br>
<p>
<p>
We could only conclude that his brain was working differently than that of <br>
most other people, not that one was right and one was wrong. Even if the <br>
brain was dead and starting to rot I can't think of any OBJECTIVE reason why <br>
it's inferior to a living healthy one, although I can think of lots of very<br>
powerful subjective ones.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;You can object to this on ideological grounds, but in point of fact         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;about the above situation.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Hey, the universe is not a democracy and we're not talking about a popularity <br>
contest. You've set a very high standard for yourself, determining objective <br>
fact, and that can't be done by a show of hands.        <br>
