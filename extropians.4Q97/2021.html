Gee, no kidding. I better write that down; I couldn't possibly already know<br>
that. Thanks for cluing me in, there. My dim, milklike perception of<br>
reality, not unlike the pale eyes of the dogfish, didn't suffice for me to<br>
be aware of my own free will. But the l;laser of your intellect has cut<br>
away the cataracts. thank you, thank you, thank you.<br>
<p>
It is also my choice, and my responsibility, to say, as I have, that I<br>
*want* *some* sort of across-the-board "speed bump", and I have already<br>
proposed one such, not costing money from me but requiring some sort of<br>
investment from others,  that turned out to be similar to something Robin<br>
Hanson had mentioned. That approach would require the establishment and<br>
maintenance of some sort of one-time-use "currency" and a trickle-feed of<br>
unique serial numbers of same to all list participants. The maillist would<br>
have to be gate-keeper'd by some sort of turnstile automaton. End result<br>
could be a predictable-total-bandwidth list.<br>
<p>
But who bells the cat? So that "solution" appears to be far too<br>
labor-intensive at present to set up.<br>

I am aware of that option. Leaving the list is an extreme example of<br>
filtering, nicht wahr?<br>
