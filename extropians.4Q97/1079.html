I tend to believe that every (or at least most) religion(s) are BASED on <br>
that. My experience with religion (christian protestant church in <br>
Germany) was completely void of any "experience" - it was just words, and <br>
second-hand information about experience.<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; The real question in all of this is, what is the origin of the religious</i><br>

<p>
Yep, that's exactly the point. But unfortunately, it seems as if the <br>
antirational baggage was one very important motivation for promoting <br>
religion - because it allows certain power structures (when people <br>
believe you)...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's one of the things that excites me, too, about the rave phenomenon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lights, rhythm, and all that unleashed tension make for a hell of a</i><br>

<i>&gt; consensual borganism might be like.</i><br>
<p>
The problem I see is that one could use that in the same manner people <br>
used other "experiences" before. When I look at great parts of the rave <br>
scene today (in Munich, Germany), most of the people that go there, go <br>
because they think it's cool. They pay $30 for a rave with 30 DJs and <br>
5.000 people, just to 'be there'. And many of them don't even smile <br>
anymore...<br>
<p>
Maybe this has just been commercialized - but fortunately, the hype <br>
usually doesn't for to long, then there's no more money in it, and people <br>
who are in it for the money look for something else ;-)<br>
<p>
