Does anyone on the list know anything about the Silva method? I have found<br>
plenty of their own claims and advertisements (www.silvaintl.com, among<br>
many others) but haven't been able to find any critiques.  URLs, magazine<br>
articles, books?<br>
<p>
I ask because a friend of mine, very close but unfortunately very<br>
sentimental and insufficiently skeptical, is convinced of the method's<br>
efficacy.  He claims that he has been able to learn a lot of useful,<br>
non-supernatural abilities such as waking up without an alarm and going to<br>
sleep on cue, enhanced concentration, etc.  This I am prepared to accept.<br>
He also claims that he and other participants of the classes can perform a<br>
diagnosis by looking at a picture.  Naturally he had an emotional account<br>
of how one of the other Silva students focused on a picture of his<br>
grandmother (or may just her name; I forget) and came up with pancreatic<br>
cancer.  My god, that's what she has!  He further claims the diagnosis<br>
was not arrived at by a "warm... warmer... hot..." line of guessing.  I<br>
don't buy it, but it's hard to tell a friend "You're deluding yourself."<br>
He's also seen ghosts...<br>
