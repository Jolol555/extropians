Yes, but the jury is (obviously) still out on this. Merkle and Smalley<br>
had<br>
a somewhat productive debate on this at Foresight 5, which I hear was <br>
continued over dinner.<br>

<i>&gt; I'd appreciate anyone's informed opinion on Dr. Smalley's assertions.</i><br>
<p>
The crux of Smalley's argument:<br>
<p>
"On a length scale of more than one nanometer, the mechanical robot <br>
assembler metaphor envisioned by Drexler almost certainly will work, <br>
but within the 1 nm3 volume surrounding the reaction site there<br>
is a subtlety and complexity that is often not fully appreciated even <br>
by practicing chemists. In any chemical reaction for all but the most <br>
trivial of molecules, the detailed mechanism takes place on a potential <br>
energy surface in an N-dimensional hyperspace, where N is of the order <br>
of 10-30 (three dimensions for each atom in the near vicinity of the <br>
reaction site). In order for a robot assembler to be completely<br>
universal, <br>
it would have to be able to control the detailed movement of not only<br>
the<br>
atom(s) to be added or removed, but also the detailed motion of all the <br>
atoms within a few bond lengths of the reaction site. Unless the motion <br>
of all the atoms is controlled in this reaction nanospace, there is no <br>
way of insuring that only the desired reaction product is obtained.<br>
Since <br>
the manipulator "fingers" of the robot would have to be made of atoms as <br>
well, there appears to be at least one fatal problem with the concept of <br>
a universal assembler: there simply is not enough room inside the 1 nm3 <br>
reaction volume both for the atoms desired in the final structure and<br>
the <br>
atomic fingers necessary to control their movement."<br>
<p>
   In the very next section he talks about catalysis, which narrows this <br>
search to essentially zero. Much current work is directed towards<br>
mounting <br>
catalysts on proximal probes.<br>
  Incidentally, Drexler doesn't particularly advocate a "Universal"<br>
assembler,<br>
Merkle and Smalley hashed through this at a panel at Foresight 5.<br>
   Smalley's latest objection is to the size of an assembler (leaving<br>
"universal <br>
out of it)- he thinks it would have a minimum volume on the order of 1<br>
cm^3 to <br>
do useful work. Though I think this estimate is wildly inaccurate, it is<br>
also<br>
pointless, in that the absolute size of an assembler doesn't matter.<br>
What matters<br>
is {number of atoms added to a structure per unit time}/{number of atoms<br>
comprising<br>
the assembler}.<br>
  Please don't construe this as an attack on Smalley- he is a wonderful<br>
guy, does<br>
top-flight work, wins prizes, etc. He's just not an engineer.<br>
