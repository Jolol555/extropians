The following is from an article in Monday's WSJ by<br>
LL Bryan called "Stocks Overvalued? Not in the New<br>
Economy"<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Are stocks fundamentally overvalued? Is last week's<br>
turmoil the beginning of a sustained bear market, as<br>
stocks return to "normal" valuations? Almost<br>
certainly not. The world's equity markets have been<br>
driven to today's levels for good reasons: The cost<br>
of equity capital has declined, and the value of<br>
intangible capital assets has increased dramatically.<br>
<p>
There's no question that the world's stocks are<br>
priced differently than they were at the start of the<br>
1990s. Market-to-book ratios of U.S. companies are<br>
now about 2-to-1, roughly double the average between<br>
1945 and 1990. Price/earnings ratios in the U.S. are<br>
at 25, vs. a historic average of about 17. My<br>
colleagues at McKinsey and I analyzed the performance<br>
of the 100 largest companies world-wide and divided<br>
them into groups based on their earnings growth and<br>
returns on book equity since 1991. We then took the<br>
20 of these companies with the least change in<br>
absolute performance. These 20 companies had an<br>
average increase in earnings of 3.8% compounded<br>
(little more than inflation) while return on book<br>
equity was flat (9.9% in 1991 and 1996). Yet their<br>
market capitalization grew by 13.5% compounded.<br>
<p>
Since the performance of these companies was<br>
unchanged, what must have changed was the price at<br>
which the market valued that performance. Many<br>
attribute this change to "irrational exuberance." But<br>
our research indicates that the underlying cause is<br>
that the cost of equity capital is falling. Research<br>
by McKinsey two years ago estimated that there will<br>
be a $12 trillion increase in household financial<br>
assets by 2002 due to the aging of the developed<br>
world's population. The research also found that the<br>
demographic forces driving this extraordinary demand<br>
for financial assets will continue to increase<br>
through at least 2010. Many of these household<br>
savers, especially in the U.S., have begun to develop<br>
a clear preference for equities over bank deposits or<br>
bonds.<br>
<p>
At the same time, corporate investment in tangible<br>
capital stock is declining. The ratio of revenue to<br>
the sum of property, plant, equipment and inventory<br>
for U.S. companies has increased by some 20% over the<br>
past 25 years. This means that U.S. companies are<br>
using about $530 billion less financial capital than<br>
they would have used otherwise. As companies<br>
elsewhere follow the U.S. lead in improving<br>
productivity, they too will release significant<br>
capital.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, governments in the developed world have<br>
dramatically slowed down the pace of new debt<br>
issuance; their bonds thus will absorb less household<br>
savings. In the past two years, we have reduced our<br>
estimate of the amount of government debt that will<br>
be outstanding in 2000 by $4 trillion. Our research<br>
also indicates it will be a decade or more before<br>
emerging markets will have a significant impact on<br>
world-wide supply and demand for capital. It<br>
therefore appears that there will be plenty of liquid<br>
financial capital seeking equity returns at least<br>
through the next decade. And whereas market breaks<br>
quickly eliminate speculative demand, it would take<br>
massive changes in investor demand, or massive new<br>
debt issuance by governments, to increase the cost of<br>
equity.<br>
<p>
Also driving the market up is the strong performance<br>
of companies pursuing global opportunities. To<br>
understand this effect we took a different list of<br>
100 global companies--those with the greatest<br>
increase in market capitalization since 1992. These<br>
companies grew their market cap by 24% compounded and<br>
produced returns to shareholders of 30% compounded<br>
over the past five years. Overall, their market<br>
capitalizations increased from $1.6 trillion to $4.7<br>
trillion, of which $2.7 trillion represents an<br>
increase in market value over book. That is, their<br>
market-to-book ratios doubled, to 4.2 from 2.1.<br>
<p>
Outstanding stock market performance for this group<br>
is not surprising given that their earnings increased<br>
at 23% compounded and their return on book equity<br>
increased from 9% to 17%. But is a market-to-book<br>
ratio of 4.2 reasonable?<br>
<p>
It could well be. Consider that historic accounting<br>
conventions understate both earnings and book capital<br>
when companies spend on "intangibles"--people,<br>
patents, brands, software, customer bases and so<br>
forth--which are increasingly the sources of value in<br>
today's global economy. Money that companies spend to<br>
create these intangible assets is considered an<br>
"expense" rather than a capital investment. For<br>
example, a rough estimate of the costs of the<br>
installed base of software in the U.S. is over $1<br>
trillion, but most of this investment has been<br>
"expensed" even though as a by-product of this<br>
spending, intangible assets are being created that<br>
have value that will endure for years.<br>
<p>
The inadequacy of our accounting conventions is not<br>
new. What is new is that the forces driving us toward<br>
a global economy--deregulation, lower transaction<br>
costs, more liquid capital markets--have made the<br>
potential value of intangible assets much higher.<br>
What's also new is that companies are investing in<br>
these intangible assets more strategically and<br>
consciously. Commercial life insurers, for example,<br>
are building cross-border expansion plans around<br>
their ability to understand risk rather than<br>
nondistinctive portfolio balancing and selling skills.<br>
<p>
Investors know this--but we have no accounting<br>
methodology for recognizing the value of investments<br>
in intangible assets. As companies accelerate<br>
spending on intangibles to capture global<br>
opportunities, "earnings" are being understated while<br>
returns on book equity and market-to-book and<br>
price/earnings ratios are being overstated. In other<br>
words, current stock market valuations are more<br>
reasonable than they appear.<br>
<p>
As companies are learning how to use their intangible<br>
assets by moving them around the world--through<br>
licensing agreements, alliances and other<br>
strategies--they are also learning how to create and<br>
hold options--making investments in brands,<br>
technologies, local market knowledge and so forth in<br>
order to stake claims on future global opportunities.<br>
Increasingly, investors are placing value on these<br>
options.<br>
<p>
Thus, we believe that many companies with high market<br>
capitalizations have real option value built into<br>
their stock price. When a company is a standalone,<br>
this option value is transparent. The Internet search<br>
company Yahoo! has a market capitalization of $1.4<br>
billion on annualized revenues of about $70 million<br>
and a book value of $110 million--clearly a<br>
reflection of its option value. Less obviously,<br>
companies like General Electric, Smith Kline Beecham,<br>
Intel and Citibank have real global option values<br>
built into their market capitalizations.<br>
<p>
These developments have outstripped the financial<br>
accounting conventions, the capital budgeting<br>
methodologies and even the mental models most firms<br>
use to run themselves. Investors hoping for the<br>
market to fall to levels that feel more "normal" are<br>
likely to have a very long wait.<br>
