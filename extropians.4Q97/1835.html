<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Your vision sounds nice, but can it be guaranteed? We live in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; world where things do go wrong, where unexpected things happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; despite precautions and where not everything is done with positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences in mind. Our development is linked with dangers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the future tends to turn out vastly different than our predictions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       True, but just because some religious people reject technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all together and are surpassed and made insignificant by the rest of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the technological world, doesn't mean they loose their right to exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or to need!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. I don't think there are any extropians (if there are, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; should think about the principles a bit closer) that think eradicating</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "pesky mehums" is a good thing. But not every posthuman will be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; saint, and a slight error in judgement of a transcendent superbeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; could destroy the remaining humans ("Oops... my cleaning nanites have</i><br>
<i>&gt; just cleaned away the entire biosphere. What a mess. Let's hope nobody</i><br>
<i>&gt; notices..."), not to mention Eugene's scenario of the posthumans one</i><br>
<i>&gt; day deciding that carbon based life is so trivial and simple that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is no need to preserve it outside virtual reality (or at all).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I want is to find ways of ensuring human survival even in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; very long run, even if the ethics of our descendants changes. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem isn't the religious nuts, the problem is the big uncertainty</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the future.</i><br>
<p>
Considering that the people most likely to transcend to posthuman states<br>
are those most far to the right of the intellectual bell curve, and that<br>
such people also tend to endure a large amount of persecution from<br>
mundanes during childhood and adolescence, I think it highly likely that<br>
at least one, if not many, of the first post humans will have highly<br>
negative viewpoints towards mundanes, and extremely negative viewpoints<br>
towards anti-tech and anti-intellectual idiots, which they would tend to<br>
use their newfound powers to devise methods of a)eliminating such<br>
morons, or b) using the technology to make such idiots forcibly into the<br>
sort of people they once despised, thus achieving (a) without killing<br>
anyone. Reactionaries will of course be on the opposite side, forming<br>
terrorist insurgencies to oppose the transition. Anyone who thinks the<br>
transcendant period will not be violently dynamic is living in a fools<br>
paradise.<br>
<p>
A good example is to compare how many conservative moslem countries have<br>
reacted in recent years to the influx of progressive western<br>
technologies, ideas, and ideals. The more extreme the distance between<br>
the ends of a political/cultural axis, the more likely this dynamism<br>
will turn to violence.<br>
