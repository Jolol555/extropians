<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;which involved two bright streams of material flying very low overhead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;One very bright orange piece appeared to hit ground, as it was followed</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;fuel cell.  Could something like this actually hit the earth?  If so, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;are they dropping these things on my head? ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; When you say 'appeared to hit ground', did you actually see it hit, or did</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it go behind a hill?</i><br>
<p>
I didn't get this Carl Feynman's e-mail for some reason, so I'll answer<br>
your question here: No.  I did not see it hit.  What I say was two streams<br>
of brightly glowing material (looked like very large roman candles<br>
slowly moving across the sky)  Once the lights disappeared behind the<br>
trees, there were numerous sounds of intense, low-frequency thunder (note,<br>
there were no clouds in the sky)  I'm thinking this was either impact, or<br>
maybe a sonic boom??? (is this possible?)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I haven't heard anything about this event, but from your description, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you saw was an object weighing at least tens of kilograms falling from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; space.  Such objects are usually satellites or other space junk, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; occaisionally natural meteorites.  It was unlikely to be a piece of Mir,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; since Mir is in a high orbit and is fairly disciplined about sending its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; junk back to Earth on spacecraft, rather than simply throwing it away.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Most satellites are of sufficiently flimsy construction that they burn up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; before hitting the ground.  Re-entry would burn off at least an inch or two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of solid steel, and few spacecraft parts are so hefty.  When Skylab</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; re-entered, the only part that survived was a radiation-proof safe they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kept their film in.  In particular, fuel cells are not dense enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; survive, AFAIK.  On the other hand, it probably was a Soviet or Russian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; object.  They sent up a lot more stuff than the rest of the world put</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; together, and they weren't as fastidious as other countries about not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; letting things fall out of orbit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They're dropping things on your head because the odds of actually hitting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anyone are pretty slim, and even if they hit someone, the chance of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; held legally responsible is small, and even then, the cost of losing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wrongful death suit are far less than the cost of launching the payload in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know who "you" is,</i><br>
<p>
Now you do. ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but according to the Russians and NORAD, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was a reentering Proton booster,</i><br>
<p>
Ah! Finally a definitive answer on what it was.  There are many rumours<br>
floating around (ie. satellite, fuel cell, etc...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; reentering as previously predicted. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; main body landed out to sea, while denser material, like the engines,</i><br>
<i>&gt; had slightly longer trajectories that took them into eastern Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt; State.</i><br>
<p>
This would make sense, what I saw was definitely heading east.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actual impacts have not been reported, but that is to be expected</i><br>
<i>&gt; given the sparseness of that part of the state. Art Bell and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorant sensationalist ufo hounds are making all sorts fo outlandish</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims that do nothing but make them look like fools to anyone who has</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen the video footage shown on KING channel 5 in Seattle.</i><br>
<p>
It was a truly amazing sight first-person.  At first, I thought I had just<br>
experience of the greatest meteor showers ever.  It was a great spectacle<br>
no matter what the lights were composed of.<br>
<p>
