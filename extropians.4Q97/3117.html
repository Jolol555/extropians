I know from experience about manufacturing lead time from breakthrough<br>
to marketplace, but 36 months is still a bit much. If they have a<br>
working prototype now, there really isn't any reason why an organization<br>
like IBM can't have it to market within 12-18 months. This could be an<br>
example where they are holding introduction of technology back to<br>
maintain commodity market value, i.e. the value of a gig of disk space.<br>

   Welcome to the wonderful world of corporate welfare. Even in 1997,
when people think technology is moving as fast as possible, the
incestuous relationship between government and big business is
essentially removing real competition from the marketplace and
slowing technology to an almost painful pace to those who are aware.
   To become "aware" takes a great deal of work and research but
it's so much easier to make fun of "that guy who always brings up
Neo-Tech--you know that new age money making scam"(usually
quoted by people who like to skim over a few pages of a philosophy
hoping to feel a "warm fuzzy" inside.) 
   For those of you that have the fortitude for a philosophy where 
thinking is necessary during *and* after reading it I recommend
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com">http://www.neo-tech.com</a>. Order and read in it's entirety _The
Neo-Tech Discovery_ by Frank Wallace. All the crazy puzzle pieces
of this civilization will then begin to fit together.
