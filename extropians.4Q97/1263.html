Sorry, its not debunkable, except that if you were able to get a country<br>
to act EXACTLY as if it were mobilizing for full scale war, if<br>
technoligical advancement were not a societal priority at the time, and<br>
the country was in the bottom of a market cycle, then it would behave<br>
EXACTLY as if  it were at war. Socio phsychologically this means you've<br>
got to convince the populace that there is an enemy to fight, goal to<br>
reach, etc. to get the desired effect. If you could do all of this and<br>
avoid the maiming and killing then that would definitely be a good<br>
thing. <br>
<p>
Do you want one example of just this sort of program? The Apollo<br>
Program. End of story.<br>
