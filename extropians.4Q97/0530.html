<i>&gt; &gt; You are incorrect.  I lay down this Continuing Challenge to all who l=</i><br>
isten:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Before you place a physical constraint on the Powers, you must first =</i><br>
place it<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on me.  And now, watch as I shoot all your "constraints" down.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In order for this to be an useful challenge, you must shoot them down</i><br>
<i>&gt; using known laws of physics, or at least likely extrapolations (marked</i><br>
<i>&gt; as such) from known physics. Otherwise you can always win by using</i><br>
<i>&gt; (say) unobtainium, angels sent by the Omega Point or the pink unicorn</i><br>
<i>&gt; force. I think exercises like this are useful (yes, I do plan to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue the nanotech thread from two months back when I get the spare</i><br>
<i>&gt; time), but they have to be stringent.</i><br>
<p>
My point is not necessarily that a given technology is feasible, and<br>
particularly not that it is feasible to us.  The Unbreakable-Limits posit=<br>
ion<br>
says:  "Such-and-such is theoretically and mathematically impossible unde=<br>
r the<br>
laws of physics, in the same sense that you cannot add two even numbers a=<br>
nd<br>
get an odd number".  I simply point out that the current, known laws of<br>
physics make the limit a practical, rather than a theoretical, one.  The<br>
Constraintarians are reduced to saying:  "Well, sure, it's theoretically<br>
possible, but I don't think it's practical."  Well, but then the SIs may =<br>
think<br>
otherwise.  You are no longer arguing that a given end is impossible unde=<br>
r the<br>
Laws Of Physics (which change all the time, anyway).  You are arguing tha=<br>
t a<br>
possible end is not achieveable - because *we* can't think of any way to =<br>
do it.<br>
<p>
Considering the pace of technology and the past history of failure, the b=<br>
urden<br>
of proof is definitely on the Constraintarian.  One must demonstrate that=<br>
 a<br>
given limit is mathematically unbreakable, and even then one may have lef=<br>
t<br>
something out.  If there exists under known physical law one possibility =<br>
in<br>
which the constraint does not hold, the constraint is practical rather th=<br>
an<br>
theoretical.  Thus Tipler cylinders, which postulate no additional laws o=<br>
f<br>
physics, are sufficient to demonstrate that time travel is not prohibited=<br>
 by<br>
the known laws of physics.<br>
<p>
My Continuing Challenge can be phrased as follows:  "Name one practical l=<br>
imit<br>
which is mathematically unbreakable under the currently known laws of<br>
physics."  Under these rules, I can't say:  "Maybe general relativity is<br>
wrong" - although it certainly could be.  But I can say:  "Tipler cylinde=<br>
rs<br>
demonstrate that CTCs are explicitly permitted by General Relativity, and=<br>
<p>
therefore physics explicitly permits computers that operate at infinite s=<br>
peeds."<br>

<i>&gt; Negative matter implies negative energy (otherwise it would not work</i><br>
<i>&gt; in circumventing the Bekenstein Bound). So it would be energetically</i><br>
<i>&gt; favorable for vacuum to decay into negative energy states if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; existed; i.e. negative matter would cause vacuum decay. Besides,</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside the special conditions of the Casimir effect, negative</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy densities appear to be ruled out in general relativity by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the strong, medium and weak energy conditions.</i><br>
<p>
One flaw, no law.  If I (or the SIs) can only have negative energy under =<br>
the<br>
Casimir (charged-plates) effect, well, then so what?  So do your computin=<br>
g<br>
between two charged plates!  Saying that a "law" can be broken "only" und=<br>
er<br>
some condition is like saying that a "secure" system can "only" be broken=<br>
 into<br>
using a backdoor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Could you name these processes? There has been some rather fierce</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments about the "real number assertion" on this list in the past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Basically, if you accept quantum mechanics it seems that you cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; use arbitrary-precision numbers.</i><br>
<p>
There was something in my Penrose about Turing-unsolvable processes that =<br>
are<br>
"unreasonable" in the sense of having a discontinous second derivative, b=<br>
ut<br>
still physically permitted.  I'm afraid I can't recall or find exact deta=<br>
ils, though.<br>
<p>
Here's a question I don't know the answer to:  Does there exist a series =<br>
of<br>
arithmetical operations that is "Turing-complete" in the sense of perform=<br>
ing<br>
arbitrary computations on the ones and zeros making up the numbers?  Woul=<br>
d<br>
analogous analog operations on real numbers permit an infinite number of<br>
Turing computations?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No. The speed of light is locally constant, that is a basic result from=</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the equations.</i><br>
<p>
He wasn't asking about "local" constants.<br>
He asked how long it would take to fill up the galaxy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are right in that in some spacetimes there are timelike</i><br>
<i>&gt; paths that can get anywhere in space-time in a finite proper time (like=</i><br>
 the<br>
<i>&gt; G=F6del universe, which is (I think) densely filled with CTCs), but the=</i><br>
re<br>

st<br>

rse<br>
<i>&gt; then we cannot get around it faster than a certain time.</i><br>

Black holes.  Tipler cylinders.  Naked singularities.  Quantum gravity. =<br>
<p>
Instantaneous (?) propagation of state-vector reduction.  Tachyons. =<br>
<p>
Wormholes.  As far as I can tell, relativistic constraints on speed leak =<br>
like<br>
a sieve.  You can't tell me it's mathematically impossible to go faster t=<br>
