Traditionally at this time of year, Americans take a few minutes to <br>
contemplate what one has been given, what one has at this time.  Many <br>
think back to times when things were less bountiful in their <br>
own lives and compare that with the accomplishments of today.  <br>
<p>
Transhumanists can extend thanks into the future.  Take a few minutes to <br>
contemplate what we will create in years to come, and give thanks for <br>
living at a time wherein we live on the brink of obtaining the knowledge <br>
and resources to make dreams reality.  While others focus mostly on what <br>
has been given, think about what we have earned and what we will <br>
build, what we will envision and what we invent.  <br>
<p>
That, and the future prospect of a huge, caloric feast!<br>
<p>
