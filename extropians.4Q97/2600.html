Personally I've been offered software contracts by people on the Net <br>
who've seen the GNU work I've done in the past; so giving software away <br>
for free certainly can pay.<br>

Hmm, you're not trying to imply that Windows, with its DLLs scattered<br>
all over the disk, is less complex than Linux? The last time I installed <br>
Linux I just slapped in a CD-ROM and floppy, booted it up, and that was <br>
pretty much that. <br>
<p>
As for kernels, while a microkernel is nice there's little advantage to<br>
the user in just stripping out most of the functionality and putting it<br>
into DLLs. If you want an OS which can readily perform complicated tasks, <br>
you're going to get a complicated OS whether the kernel is 10k or 100k.<br>
