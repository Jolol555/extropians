<i>&gt; 	I enjoyed your "The Calculus of Identity" page, very</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.  Within it you seem to consider the "self function" to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a kind of "relative" thing based on opinions or whatever of whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; the particular self thing is.  But of course such opinions can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; mistaken can't they?  You said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the self-function need not be universal, it is unique for each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system (I identify myself with my actions, you might identify with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your memes and somebody might identify with their body). So if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assume the existence of some kind of abstract "superself-function"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which for any system gives us its sense of identity</i><br>
<p>
The point here is, that different people have different senses of<br>
self, and it might even vary during time or when they are in certain<br>
states. So I introduced my two-variable self function to deal with<br>
this. Of course, when you apply the self-function to somebody else,<br>
you will most likely be wrong about that person's sense of self.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	For a moment let's assume that there is no such thing as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortal spiritual ghost inside our body that is ourselves.  If a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person identifies himself as such a fictional "ghost" which he might</i><br>
<i>&gt; sincerely believe is inside his body, then his concept of self would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not exist right?  Since his false ideas had no correspondence to</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything in reality.</i><br>
<p>
No. His self(me, myself) would evaluate to something. If this dualist<br>
then realized the error of his ways he would become a slightly<br>
different person, and his self(me', myself') could evaluate to<br>
something else (but likely he would think he had not become somebody<br>
different, just a bit more enlightened).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	You said you identify yourself with your actions.  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only partially true isn't it?  Wouldn't a very different body that</i><br>
<i>&gt; acted the same as you be different than you?</i><br>
<p>
In what way? I would consider another entity which acted just like me<br>
as another instance of me, a me-over-there which is another physical<br>
instance of the abstract class 'Me' (of which I'm currently the only<br>
instance).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	So, shouldn't a self() function, rather than be something that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is relative to the particular system or person, be something that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more absolute and universal?  Shouldn't it consist of all true</i><br>
<i>&gt; attributes of the self and none that are false or not really existent</i><br>
<i>&gt; attributes?</i><br>
<p>
Can you have an erroneous sense of selfhood? If I ask you if you are<br>
yourself, would you be able to be mistaken? I would say that is not<br>
possible; we may have stupid ideas about who we are, the philosophy of<br>
identity or what we think is our self() functions, but deep down we<br>
all feel a sense of identity to some extent. The attributes of our<br>
selves are not relevant, what I was trying to model is personal<br>
experience of self.<br>
