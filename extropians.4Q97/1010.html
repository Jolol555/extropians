<i>&gt; &gt;I'd be very interested in this. At the moment, the names "Extropianism"</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;the Extropian Principles - can be found in Transhumanism,too.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Holger, I explained the relationship between transhumanism and extropianism</i><br>

I'm not sure if I got this - I've changed from digest mode to the normal<br>
mailing-list yesterday. I didn't unsubscribe from the digest but haven't<br>
received the last one. I guess I'll try retrieving it from the<br>
mailserver (I might have missed some of the replies to my postings, too)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, in brief: Extropianism in one specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; version of transhumanism. It's specific character is defined by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian Principles (see our web site at www.extropy.org)</i><br>
<i>&gt; There can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; many kinds of transhumanists, all of whom share general goals of overcoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; human limits. They may differ on the best means of doing so, and on what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they emphasize.</i><br>
<p>
I think this perfectly answers my question, thanks!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm living in Munich, Germany and am currently trying to find a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;people around me who are open to Extropian ideas for discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry we didn't meet when I was in Munich in March this year.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I didn't even know Extropy existed at that time. I first<br>
read about it in the excellent article in that German computer-magazine<br>
(c't).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropy Institute have a couple of contacts in the area. We would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt; encourage an Institute offshoot there.</i><br>
<p>
That sure would be a good thing. I'm currently discussing some of the<br>
extropian ideas with a few friends of mine, and forwarding them some of<br>
the postings to the mailing-list. So far, the reactions have been<br>
sceptical - but the more they know, the more they understand it makes a<br>
lot of sense (I, for an instance, thought cryonics were more of a<br>
religious idea until I read the part in the Extropy-FAQ which made quite<br>
clear what it's about - it's not a sci-fi-dream, it's just "the second<br>
worst thing that can happen to you - the worst is being eaten up by<br>
worms" ;-) )<br>
<p>
later,<br>
