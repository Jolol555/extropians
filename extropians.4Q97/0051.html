 The Nolan Chart is more pragmatic: its axes are "Personal Freedom"<br>
 (sex, drugs, the draft) and "Economic Freedom" (minimum wage, taxes,<br>
 licensing).  Used with the "World's Shortest Political Quiz", which<br>
 some have criticized for its quick'n'dirty selection of questions<br>
 which may tend to overestimate the number of libertarians.<br>
 <br>
 (Dave Nolan is a founder of the LP.)<br>

Oh!!  I carry the "world's shortest Political Quiz" around in my<br>
wallet...right next to my Libertarian membership card...didn't even know that<br>
was what you were referring too...sorry to waste your time..<br>
<p>
Howeve...I beleive that it and/or Pournelles' make a lot more since than the<br>
typical left-right silliness...as used by the mediaghouls in popular<br>
commentary it is approximately worthless<br>
