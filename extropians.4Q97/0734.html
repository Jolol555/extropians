My land is on an Indian reservation, <br>
purchased from the Tribes at fair market value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Actually, I read an article by some anthropoligist</i><br>

<p>
This appears to be the case, both on linguistic grounds and DNA <br>
studies. At least *four* such waves of immigration took place before <br>
the European invasion. Each one displaced the previous, causing it to <br>
move southward. The remains of the oldest wave are in South America, <br>
the newest in Alaska and northern Canada.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wish I'd kept the article, or at least took notes!</i><br>

<i>&gt;a new spin on the "America belongs to the Native Americans,</i><br>

<p>
Indeed. BTW, I don't use the term "Native American", in part for the <br>
reasons above. I call them Indians, as do all my Indian friends and <br>
aquaintances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;History suggests that government's ability to legislate ownership</i><br>

Hmmm. I don't think Earth governments will be physically able to <br>
enforce space resourse claims.<br>
