<i>&gt; is that there may be no place to go.  I like those who are actively</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to construct such a place such as in the Atlantis Project</i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://oceania.org/">http://oceania.org/</a>) and the Millennial Project</i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://www.millennial.org/">http://www.millennial.org/</a>).  I try to remain optimistic and</i><br>
<i>&gt; plan/effect a better (not worse) future.  What else can I realistically</i><br>
<i>&gt; do?</i><br>
<p>
I also think that in the end, there will be some form of new freedom<br>
paradigm, but it wont be an easy or painless road to get there, and that<br>
the dynamism of technology will be at the heart of it all.<br>
<p>
I don't count myself among those cheering on an armageddon/downfall, but<br>
I do expect that the liklihood of such an occurence to be high enough<br>
that my failing to prepare at all would be simple stupid negligence.<br>
THis is also why I speak out for individual rights as much as I do.<br>
Given a loud enough message, governments do respond. The more we<br>
publicly oppose continued repression in calm, measured, reasoning ways,<br>
the later will be the day that darkness is likely to fall, and therefore<br>
maximizes the time available to develop a technological out. THose that<br>
simply accept further impingement on their rights for security's sake<br>
will have only themselves to blame when they find themselves having<br>
neither safety, nor liberty. For evil to succeed, it only requires that<br>
good men do nothing.<br>
