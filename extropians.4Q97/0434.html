For the last 16 years France has had the slowest rate of economic growth of <br>
any industrial nation on Earth, during this same period it has also had the <br>
most extensive central planing, excepting of course economic powerhouses like <br>
Russia, Cuba, North Korea,  and other such bastions of freedom.<br>
<p>
The reason France has one of the most highly regulated labor markets in the <br>
world is apparently because they believe that the best way to create new jobs <br>
is to discourage entrepreneurs. The unemployment rate in France is 12.5% and <br>
rising, even though the French work week is only 39 hours long, in the USA <br>
the unemployment rate is 4% , and counting overtime, the average American who <br>
has a job works 20% more hours a week than the average working Frenchman.<br>
 <br>
Showing a level of intelligence that is rare even for a politician, France's <br>
new socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin figures that the only way to cure <br>
his country's economic ills is to crank out even more regulations. He wants <br>
to decrease the work  week to 35 hours and force companies to pay the same <br>
wages for the reduced  labor, he wants to do this by Jan 1 2000. Jospin <br>
thinks it's obvious that working less will create more wealth for France, <br>
it's so obvious that  there is no need to spell out exactly how.<br>
 <br>
To help compensate companies for the staggering financial loss they will <br>
suffer the government plans to give them $1500 a year for each employee.   <br>
Where the government would get the money to make these payoffs to corporations  <br>
Lionel Jospin does not say and does not seem to think very important. <br>
Actually he's probably correct to believe that to be a minor point, <br>
government may have its faults but it has always been able to convince people <br>
to give  it money when it needs it, perhaps because politicians have learned <br>
that you can be more persuasive with a smile and a gun than you can with a <br>
smile alone.                                  <br>
