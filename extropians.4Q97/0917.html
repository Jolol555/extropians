In a message dated 97-10-28 08:03:01 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; 's a bit double, when I think you/things have enough height,<br>
 I forget about the gravity, and when I think of escaping gravity, I think<br>
 to easily that your in space (so, you are weightless) and therefor<br>
 nothing is pulling you back. Which as I start to learn isn't so.<br>
 I try to project visual (in my head) all the different influences on the<br>
 tower, to<br>
 understand how it works up there.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
Arthur C. Clarke wrote a book..."fountains of paradise"....and Charles<br>
Sheffield wrote a book...the name of which excapes me...which discuss the<br>
"beanstalk"concept...and address some of  your concerns...particularly the<br>
difference between height and orbit...and how you could be at orbital<br>
altitude...but not be at orbital velocity...and thus fall to earth...with<br>
lethal consequences..<br>
<p>
Some years ago in ANALOG the notion of beanstalks was discussed...if I<br>
remember correctly...Kevlar was strong enough for the moon and possibly<br>
mars...nothing then for earth...<br>
<p>
I don't remember winds as being a problem...and don't think I accept it as<br>
such...However... i "play" in 70mph "winds" all day long .<br>
