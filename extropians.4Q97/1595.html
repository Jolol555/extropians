<i>&gt; Well, there's Oliver ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oliver was found in West Africa about thirty years ago and brought</i><br>

<i>&gt; I first heard of him in a segment on television about a year ago;</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
As  I recall, Oliver was a bonobo chimp. Bonobo's can walk erect much<br>
better than any other non-human, and oliver might simply have been a<br>
rather odd but talented bonobo, possibly a mutant. Since chimps share<br>
98% of our DNA, its logical that a few human-like mutations to the<br>
remaining percentage would produce noticable results.<br>
