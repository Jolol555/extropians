I agree, but it's not just in the political arena that people pick and<br>
choose what they want.  This same attitude occurs with facts from any<br>
subject area.  People beleive the ones that support their beliefs and<br>
disbelieve the ones that conflict with their belief.  Even on a supposedly<br>
enlightened list such as this one, I see no difference in the way people<br>
absorb ideas they wish to be true and reject ideas they hope aren't true.<br>
Virtually everybody joins a "cult", and viretually every "cult" claims that<br>
it is different and more realistic.  People believe what they choose to<br>
believe, and like to claim that facts support their belief.  But somehow,<br>
everybody seems to find a group that is totally objective, that also<br>
believes what they have always believed.  Religious followers find their<br>
religion, Sci-Fi fans find their futurist groups, political types find<br>
their political agenda groups, etc.<br>
