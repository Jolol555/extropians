If the galactic halo was a bunch of Dyson spheres generating antimatter<br>
for later, or disassembled stars, we'd score.  Except for why they left<br>
the rest of the galaxy alone.  As a compact reservation?  Fine, but<br>
apparently every other galaxy would have the same structure.  Seems odd,<br>
without FTL.<br>

I've wondered about the intergalatic bubbles: if you had a soup of<br>
galaxies, and randomly seeded it with rare expanding intelligence, would<br>
you get the bubbles we observe, with visible galaxies in the areas<br>
between colonized volumes?  I have trouble checking the idea against the<br>
fact that we're seeing everything in the past, though, and against the<br>
flux in the old background radiation.<br>

"For instance, suppose we apply this to nuclear weapon explosions over<br>
inhabited cities.  The Copernican principle says that we don't have a<br>
privileged position within the interval of such usage - odds are, most<br>
of them have already happened.  And the odds that there are thousands<br>
and thousands to come?  Just astronomical.  So don't worry, be happy -<br>
no nuclear wars can ever happen, probably."<br>
