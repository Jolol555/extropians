<p>
You lack imagination.  :)<br>
<p>
Seriously, objective morality wouldn't be a force pervading the Universe for<br>
Good, just an objective method of labeling events "good" or "evil".  Does the<br>
existence of "objective cardinality" cause there to be more of things?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope I don't come off sounding too cold hearted in all this, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody claims to be able to prove OBJECTIVE morality then the game moves</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of the gentle examining room of ethics and religion and into the harsh</i><br>
<i>&gt; no holds barred arena of science, because objective facts is what science is</i><br>
<i>&gt; good at. Like any theory it must be strong enough to survive brutal criticism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; only the very toughest theories survive in science and I'm afraid objective</i><br>
<i>&gt; morality is a dead duck.</i><br>
<p>
I very strongly agree.  Any person claiming that a given event has a given<br>
objective ethical value is making a scientific claim, and must be able to<br>
prove eir assertion by the rules of science.  The statement that objective<br>
morality exists is analogous to the statement that objective reality exists;<br>
it is a precondition for scientific scrutiny.  Guesses and speculations about<br>
what the objective values are must meet the same standards as scientific speculation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That gives me an idea, suppose you're right and objective morality exists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and suppose you go to an alternate universe where it does not, how would</i><br>
<i>&gt; things be the slightest bit different?</i><br>
<p>
Suppose that objective cardinality exists.  If you went to an alternate<br>
Universe where numbers did not exist, how would things be the slightest bit different?<br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;Maybe there is such a thing as "Objective Humor"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well maybe objective humor does have a useful meaning, but just suppose it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not and I could prove it, would you then vow never to laugh again?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I doubt it, and if I could prove that objective morality did not exist I very</i><br>
<i>&gt; much doubt you would start pushing people into gas chambers.</i><br>
<p>
Even if objective humor doesn't exist, I still find laughter pleasurable, and<br>
conscious pleasure is one a plausible candidate for objective good.  So you'd<br>
also have to prove that pleasure was meaningless, as well as humor, before I<br>
stopped laughing.  Even then, laughing may contribute to my mental health,<br>
which contributes to my efficiency, so you'd also have to prove my work (the<br>
Singularity) meaningless, and in order to do that you'd have to disprove<br>
objective morality.<br>

<i>&gt; We could only conclude that his brain was working differently than that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; most other people, not that one was right and one was wrong. Even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain was dead and starting to rot I can't think of any OBJECTIVE reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's inferior to a living healthy one, although I can think of lots of very</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful subjective ones.</i><br>
<p>
Just because you can't think of something doesn't mean it isn't there.  The<br>
Earth orbited the Sun for centuries before anyone realized it was actually<br>
moving in a straight line.  I can't think of any OBJECTIVE reason why anything<br>
exists, but that doesn't keep me from having this wild, ungrounded faith in<br>
objective reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hey, the universe is not a democracy and we're not talking about a popularity</i><br>
<i>&gt; contest. You've set a very high standard for yourself, determining objective</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, and that can't be done by a show of hands.</i><br>
<p>
Not at all; I've set a very high standard for anyone arrogant enough to claim<br>
eir particular system of ethics is superior.  You should sympathize with this,<br>
since you're always attacking those people.  My ethical imperatives are all<br>
interim solutions and are presented as such.  Wouldn't the Universe be a much<br>
nicer place if everyone else did the same?<br>
