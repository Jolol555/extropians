In early November, I posted to the list a set of predictions made by<br>
artificial intelligence pioneers Herb Simon and Allen Newell in 1958.<br>
Prediction number three was: <br>
<p>
  3. That within ten years a digital computer will write music that will<br>
  be accepted by critics as possessing considerable aesthetic value. <br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg commented that composer David Cope had created a music<br>
composition system called EMI <br>
(see <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/home">http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/home</a>). <br>
<p>
Anders also stated, "It is probably best described as computer assisted<br>
composition, but it is not unlikely that it could fool at least some<br>
people at a "musical Turing test"." <br>
<p>
The prescience of his double-negated analysis is revealed in an article<br>
that appeared in todays New York Times Cybertimes section. <br>

Begin excerpt:  <br>
<p>
In a low-key, musical version of the match between Garry Kasparov and the<br>
chess-playing machine called Deep Blue, a musician at the University of<br>
Oregon competed last month with a computer to compose music in the style<br>
of Johann Sebastian Bach. Dr. Steve Larson, who teaches music theory at<br>
the university, listened anxiously while his wife, the pianist Winifred<br>
Kerner, performed three entries in the contest -- one by Bach, one by<br>
Larson and one by a computer program called EMI, or Experiments in Musical<br>
Intelligence.<br>
<p>
Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece -- a simple,<br>
engaging form called a two-part invention -- was written by the computer.<br>
But he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners went on to decide that<br>
the invention composed by EMI (pronounced "Emmy") was genuine Bach. <br>
<p>
"Bach is absolutely one of my favorite composers," Larson said. "My<br>
admiration for his music is deep and cosmic. That people could be duped by<br>
a computer program was very disconcerting."<br>
<p>
The cybernetic pretender, which was invented by David Cope, a composer at<br>
the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been upsetting long-held<br>
assumptions by people in the music world because of its ability to scan<br>
pieces by famous composers, automatically distill some of their essence<br>
and then churn out imitations of the work.<br>
<p>
The cognitive scientist and author Dr. Douglas Hofstadter, who presided<br>
over the contest at the University of Oregon in Eugene, calls EMI "the<br>
most thought-provoking project in artificial intelligence that I have ever<br>
come across."<br>
<p>
"EMI forces us to look at great works of art and wonder where they came<br>
from and how deep they really are," he said. "Nothing I've seen in<br>
artificial intelligence has done this so well."<br>
