<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Changing from an open to a closed universe is, of course, a nice</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought experiment but the most practically unlikely an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; engineering feat as has ever been dreamed up!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We'll see about that; in a few billion years it may be quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; practical. It is also the biggest possible engineering feat, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; YOUR GONE IN THE HEAD MATE</i><br>

<i>&gt; Futurologists (or any forecasters in the social or natural sciences)</i><br>
<i>&gt; will tell you that prediction/forecasting beyond 20 years is folly. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think this is sort of like the extropian idea of the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brilliant people like Stephen Hawking does talk about "Baby</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universes" that could be pinched off from our own (possibly from</i><br>
<i>&gt; wormholes) and the possibility of traveling to a prior point in time</i><br>
<i>&gt; within this universe is also plausible.  These notions are more</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to me than saving a part of the current cosmos we live in per</i><br>
<i>&gt; se. Sincerely, Bill</i><br>
<p>
The requirements for one method of opening a closed universe -- or <br>
closing an open one -- are known, at least roughly.<br>
<p>
All we need is the ability to shift very large masses of matter <br>
arbitrarily through time.<br>
<p>
If the universe is closed, and you wish it open -- throw a few <br>
thousand galactic clusters a few billion years into the future, <br>
decreasing the current mass of the universe.  Repeat as necessary.<br>
<p>
If it is open, and you wish it closed -- throw those same galaxies <br>
equally far into the past, increasing the previous mass of the <br>
universe.  That same mass will by normal means then occur twice in <br>
your time (or at least your immediate past).<br>
<p>
Of course, the engineering problems in this proposal are somewhat <br>
daunting.   :-)<br>
<p>
And if some people want an open universe, while others want a closed <br>
universe...<br>
