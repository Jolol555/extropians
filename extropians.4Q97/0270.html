Sorry, I thought a list of historical precedent would be sufficient<br>
argument. Ok, maybe not. How about this: Can any socialist in the<br>
audience please tell me why they think government spends money better<br>
than private industry, when public debt must be given tax exempt status<br>
in order to attract sufficient investment to purchase that debt, while<br>
stocks in private corporations, the largest 40 of which have an average<br>
annual growth rate twice that of the rate of return on public debt<br>
instruments. If government was so much better, then Government bonds<br>
would give a higher rate of return without tax exempt status.<br>
<p>
I think the rate of return on investment is possibly the best yardstick<br>
one can measure the relative performance of public vs. private sectors.<br>
<p>
In terms of how well consumers are treated by product or service<br>
providers, perhaps we can use yardsticks like: <br>
<p>
a) what is the relative accident rate in automobiles between the US and<br>
former Soviet Union (in accidents/fatalities per vehicle)?<br>
b) what is the relative rate of time it takes for an American utility<br>
customer to get a new service hooked up, vs. the same service in the<br>
former Soviet Union, China, or, say France or Italy ( western countries<br>
that are relatively inundated with socialists and communists).<br>
c) what is the relative rate of time it takes for a person in the US to<br>
get regular dialysis treatement set up vs. socialist nations? For<br>
surgery of any kind?<br>
<p>
Some other questions to ask:<br>
<p>
How many people have been shot and killed in their beds by hit squads<br>
hired by the mom and pop store down the street (including New York City,<br>
I'll be daring)?<br>
How many by Governments?<br>
<p>
how many corporations have imprisoned journalists? Governments?<br>
<p>
How much do you pay for gasoline?<br>
<p>
How much of your income are you graciously permitted to take home?<br>
<p>
How much of your income is confiscated to fund a government retirement<br>
fund for people retired right now, yet is not solvent enough to exist by<br>
the time you retire?<br>
How about your private retirement fund? Is it allowed to carry unfunded<br>
liabilities?<br>
Of the amount your parents have contributed to your public retirement<br>
fund, how much time is that money expected to last at their expected<br>
entitlement level?<br>
