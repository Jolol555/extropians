Anton, I missed your original post, catching it only via Kennita's response,<br>
so I might have missed some vital context. <br>
<p>
I'd written:<br>
<i>&gt;:...The roots "ex" and "tropy" essentially mean "out of" and "disorder."...</i><br>
<p>
to which you responded (at least in part):<br>
<i>&gt; Er, Tom, I think you'll find that _tropy_ means `turning'</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, but it has other, more relevant meanings, too.  As Kennita pointed<br>
out, the Greek root also means "transformation."  Furthermore, the definition<br>
of the suffixed form "trop-ay" as in "entropy" is "change."  Granted that is<br>
not *exactly* "disorder" but I hedged my claim with "essentially" to cover<br>
the gap between literal definition of the root and modern understanding of<br>
its use in the context of "entropy."  In the name of Bob, I thus call for<br>
some slack!<br>
<p>
Kennita charitably added:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Both "negentropy" and "extropy" place a Latin prefix on a Greek root</i><br>
<i>&gt;(yes, "en-" is also Greek), but so what? They get the point across.</i><br>
<p>
My source on Indo-European roots classifies "ex" as a Greek root meaning "out<br>
of, from," so I don't think that "extropy" improperly mixes roots.  It is<br>
also a Latin root, with a similar meaning, but that shouldn't throw us.<br>
<p>
Tom<br>
