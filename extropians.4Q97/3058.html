<i>&gt; When you say "Nobody will feel hurt, so what's the problem?", does </i><br>
<i>&gt; that mean that you are a hedonist? If so, then the optimal </i><br>
<i>&gt; organization of the world might be one where there is some amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionless AI, and the rest of the available matter is transformed </i><br>
<i>&gt; into pleasure-maximal structures -- say simulations of </i><br>
<i>&gt; human brains having orgasms, but highly optimized and without </i><br>
<i>&gt; unecessary cognitive functions.</i><br>
<p>
"Pleasure-maximal structures" - I love that term. I have this vision<br>
of immense fractal megastructures forming entire dyson spheres, all<br>
built for experiencing total bliss (not necessarily by being<br>
passive?). A bit like the "Infinite Fun Space" that the Minds of Iain<br>
Bank's Culture novels spend much time in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or I could only create a clone of myself without the moustache, leaving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the moustached original enslaved to a tuft of intelligent hair.  How intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do we want the [sub-]entities to be to grant them such rights? )</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting question. I think that Anders has the rule of thumb that </i><br>
<i>&gt; an entity has rights if and only if it can demand them. That rule </i><br>
<i>&gt; has some repugnant consequences though. It seems to imply that we </i><br>
<i>&gt; could torture animals and butch humans who are retarded. (Perhaps the </i><br>
<i>&gt; rule is only supposed to state a sufficient condition for having </i><br>
<i>&gt; rights, not a necessary one?)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I tend to regard it as sufficient, but not necessary. <br>
<p>
Recently there have been some debate here in sweden about the rights<br>
of animals (especially after a small scandal where Peter Singer was<br>
not allowed to speak at a conference due to his views on retarded<br>
children (!)), which got me thinking about how we treat other entities<br>
and what rights we give them or not. I would say that there is nothing<br>
wrong with extending rights to other entities that cannot demand these<br>
rights or understand them, but it is *we* who do this, there is no<br>
natural ethics which says that certain structures should have rights<br>
and others should not. This of course means we will draw a more or<br>
less arbitrary line based on our own ethical system, say determined by<br>
awareness, but there is nothing wrong with this. We cannot give every<br>
possible system rights (is it unethical for me to eat a carrot? It is<br>
also alive and weakly information-processing. What about the rights of<br>
flames?), and we shouldn't give just the systems that demand rights<br>
rights.<br>
<p>
Of course, this doesn't solve the moustache problem. If it is a<br>
rational moustache, it might be convinced to make a deal with its<br>
host, but I don't know what to do with irrational moustaches.<br>
