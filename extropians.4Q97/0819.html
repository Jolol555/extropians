<p>
Ignorance of the law is recognised as a mitigating factor. A few years<br>
ago I was out waterskiing on Lake Washington with a freind. We didn't<br>
have a third person to act as watcher. I was driving, so when the Coast<br>
Guard stopped us, I got a ticket for it. When I went to court, I<br>
explained that I was a resident of New Hampshire and was not aware of<br>
the regulations for water skiing there in washington state. The judge<br>
ruled that as a mitigating factor and let me off.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, if a child is born in an apartment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; and its parents die sometime thereafter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the landlord, in accord with libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; theory, has the right to evict the child,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; to use force against the child, even as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the child did not sign any contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;SO you are saying that since the parents died in the apartment, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effect abandoning the child, then under the lease, the landlord can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;claim the child?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Libertarians seem to think that they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; an inherent right to property upon which a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The population was here before the government was.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This brings up my major question about Libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of two things would need to happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  But as long as there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; will always attempt to do so.</i><br>
<p>
That is where civil disputes are still a big part of libertarian theory.<br>
Use of civil legal remedies to counteract coercive acts in a libertarian<br>
society has been fully hashed out.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it all depends on how it is done. If libertarian lawmakers get in<br>
office and merely change the laws in a way that encourages people to<br>
live, work, and think in libertarian ways, then people will for the most<br>
part be free to be unlibertarian, but will pay to beable to live and<br>
work in such anti-freedom ways. People really have no idea how much of<br>
their lives are shaped and influenced by such mundane things as tax and<br>
social welfare policies. For example, people wonder why so many welfare<br>
people seem to be generationally attached to it, but they don't know<br>
that there are, or have been rules that prohibit welfare recipients from<br>
owning assets of such mundane value as a car or even a share in a family<br>
business. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.</i><br>
<p>
Since this country used to be pretty libertarian, at least much more so<br>
than it is now, any actions taken under arms by libertarians can legally<br>
be construed as merely a the enforcement of a civil law remedy. Freedom<br>
loving people have seen their rights be eroded for several decades, so<br>
any action they take is merely the enforcement of a class action suit.<br>
Our Constitution already recognises that if the people feel the<br>
government is not representing them, is acting in a tyrranical manner,<br>
then it should be overthrown. Thomas Jefferson said, "The tree of<br>
Liberty, from time to time, must be watered with the blood of tyrants<br>
and patriots."<br>
<p>
I would by no stretch of the imagination call the US Constitution, nor<br>
Thomas Jefferson a fascist document or a fascist person. The only way<br>
you can even make any parallel between communism and libertarianism is<br>
that they are at extreme opposite ends of any political spectrum.<br>
Libertarians want to be able to prevent others from violating other<br>
individuals while communists consider violating other's rights as an<br>
obvious given.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can anyone talk me out of this?</i><br>
<p>
Easy, the internet is possibly the largest and most successful<br>
libertarian experiment in history, and you don't see wars, etc.<br>
Obsolescent governments are trying to force sovreignty on the internet<br>
by have found that to be rather problematic. Since anything crossing<br>
state lines is legaly interstate commerce, they can't under the<br>
Constitution legally mess with it, and so long as congress sees a<br>
libertarian policy vis a vis the internet as a positive business<br>
environment, they won't change it, and even the Communications Decency<br>
Act they tried to pass has been tossed out, so even their power is<br>
limited. Because the internet is predominantly a communications medium<br>
between people, the First Amendment is paramount with anything done on<br>
it. WHile there is little case law on the internet, the touchy areas<br>
with things like porno on the net in the end will I beleive, be found to<br>
only be enforceable in the originating data's jurisdiction under the<br>
standards of that jurisdiction. If such a policy is not ultimately<br>
practiced, we can all shortly expect to be living on the net according<br>
to the moral codes of the Wahabi sect of Saudi Arabia. SInce that does<br>
not seem palatable to most people, such a situation would obviously<br>
naturally encourage people to err on the side of libertarianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The only difference between the smalltime</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yet there is no libertarian rule that places</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; ing claims of Native Americans, but none of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the guilty are alive today. If we say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; bably stands on once Indian territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the importance of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; lies in the utility of private property,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; such that people are more prosperous when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; individuals are allowed maximum control of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; areas that they purchase in exchange with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; that owns a vast area wants his tenants to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; prosper, he will allow them a very high</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; degree of liberty. He will allow them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; control parcels of land and trade them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; What makes the market work is the ease with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; which customers can exit a given establishment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; What makes government not work is the difficulty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; with which customers can exist the country. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; comes down to size. This places emphasis on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; fixed and limited parcel of territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Since the sovreign power of the US gov't is delegated by the people as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;individuals, if the people decide to abolish it, break it up in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;anti-trust action, or make its role entirely voluntary for each and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;every individual, allowing people to "go armadillo" in Vinge's terms,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;then its legal. Since this voluntary principle already exists in the tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;code and in the Social Security Act, its not unprecendented.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;--</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;TANSTAAFL!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Although America is theoretically a democracy, in fact we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a very complicated series of mechanisms of political control ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforced by violence or threat of violence.  "The people" may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumvent those mechanisms and remain within the existing laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Since the Constitution is the ultimate law, and it already recognises<br>
the people's right to revolt against unjust laws, governments, and<br>
rulers, any lesser law that limits that right is in itself unjust and<br>
should be disobeyed. While I personally am not opposed to use of force<br>
in such actions, nonviolent actions can and do acheive their goals of<br>
overturning unjust laws and unjust governments, and would be just as<br>
illegal as an action using force of arms. A mob is nothing more than an<br>
unthinking, unguided missile.<br>
<p>
There also is nothing wrong with libertarians using nonviolent means to<br>
acheive their goals. This is essentially what has happened in the former<br>
Soviet Union.<br>
