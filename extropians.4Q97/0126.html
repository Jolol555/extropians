Hi!<br>
<p>
Sorry for the late reply but I've been quite busy lately.<br>

It's interesting but I don't have the time for such a project. Also, if<br>
I was to start a mailing list it wouldn't be to gain converts to<br>
extropism since I don't even agree with all extropian positions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I do know economists that don't see free-markets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as the best solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; References?  Who are these economists and what have they written?  Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are mistaking economists and political scientists?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think they've written much but they seem to have a good<br>
knowledge of the subject, at least for me. Most of them work in the<br>
University of Economy in Oporto, a very prestigious institution,<br>
actually the minister of economy works for the University of Economy in<br>
Oporto. Other economists I talk to are students of economics, they must<br>
know something about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution, it's not the ultimate truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, but what is?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That is what I would like to find out. I asked my original questions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; because I wanted to see if free-markets was a possible solution to many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the world's problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which problems?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you define your problems, it might be easier to solve them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the two major world problems are lack of freedom, and lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt; productivity per capita.  If you study economics, you will instantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize that the free market maximizes these two things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If your world problems are "too much freedom" and "too much productivity",</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the free market is definitely not for you.  I hear there are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; some communist countries accepting new residents ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, if you world problem is "not enough equality", then again the free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market is not for you.  If we were all equal, there would be no diversity.  </i><br>
<p>
First, it's rather interesting, and I take it as an praise, when you<br>
discreetly insinuate I might be communist. I've been insulted before, on<br>
other mailing-lists and because of my site, and people already called me<br>
both communist and fascist (although not in the same message, of<br>
course). It's rather interesting how people tend to reduce others to<br>
stereotypes and that is exactly what you are trying to do (in a indirect<br>
way since you put an "if" before your sentence but you're not very far<br>
from it). I'm not from left or right, I'm above all that (and I'm also a<br>
convinced jerk but that you probably already noticed).<br>
<p>
My world problems? Freedom? Productivity? Are you living in the same<br>
planet I live? Do you know that more than 30'000 children die each day<br>
of avoidable causes? Do you want to know how much people have died in<br>
wars in the last decades? Do you know that at least 30% of the world<br>
population lives in poverty?<br>
I don't know about you but my idea of a good place to live in must first<br>
correct this injustices and only then care about tax rates and<br>
stockholders. And that is exactly why I disagree with free-markets, they<br>
won't solve any of these problems and they will only work in the<br>
direction of the already wealthy (and I mean a lot more wealthier than<br>
us, or at least I) while discarding the poor. Obviously (at least for me<br>
it's obvious) I cannot agree with such a system that might even create a<br>
few more millionaires but will leave the overall world population in<br>
poverty. That is not the world I want to leave for the generations to<br>
come.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An A chord is always an A chord</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you should go to your local library or even the internet, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; search for the word "epistemology" before you make a statement like that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; What makes you so sure?   Why is he "immediately wrong"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Come on, a philosophical discussion now!? You know what I mean. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; nope.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe the currrent A chord is actually out of tune with the original A</i><br>
<i>&gt; chord, or theoretical A chord based on the other chords. hmmm.... that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounded ugly.  "you know what I mean"? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; how do you know when you have found the "truth"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; how do you know when someone is "immediately wrong"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; is it a warm, fuzzy feeling?</i><br>
<p>
When I (or any other musician) listen to an A chord (a correct A chord,<br>
if the guitar is not tuned it is not an A chord), we instinctively<br>
recognize it as one (at least if it's played in a guitar or keyboard, I<br>
never listened to an A chord when played on some exotic instruments). If<br>
anyone disagrees with us, he is wrong because that is an A chord as<br>
defined many centuries ago and accepted till our days by all musicians<br>
as an A chord. Is that so hard to understand? <br>
