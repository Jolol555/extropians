I too.  Imagine how many people wonder the same thing.  But such a shift of<br>
perspective will require more than uplifting.  It will require the ability<br>
to shift<br>
one's mode of perception -- even conception, to a different set of parameters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	Yes.  It also surely isn't a hard line which on one side</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals are sentient and on the other they are not.  It's a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;broad, gradual and complex continuum.</i><br>
<p>
Current evidence does not seem to suggest this.  I think much of the ape<br>
and dolphin language studies seem to show no unambiguous evidence of<br>
intelligence.  In fact, the ambiguities in the data make me doubt whether<br>
any of these supposedly intelligent organisms is anywhere near the level<br>
of human awareness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm sure echo-locating animals</i><br>
<i>&gt;such as bats and other animals, especially the higher ones mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt;here like whales..., have sensations humans have never felt.  In these</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular areas they would be "more sentient" than we are.  "What is</i><br>
<i>&gt;it like to be a bat?" is the famous question by Nagal.  What is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;like to be a fish with a hook in it's mouth?  Does a fish feel pain</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same way we do or does its body just twitch and flex the way an</i><br>
<i>&gt;unfeeling machine might?  It's probably neather of these but something</i><br>
<i>&gt;phenomenally different and we just don't yet know just what it IS</i><br>
<i>&gt;like.</i><br>
<p>
I too would like to know, though it is not the most important thing for me<br>
vis a vis uplifting.  Instead, I hope the a nonhuman mind would be able<br>
to help human ones jump to posthumanity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	Until we can truly understand what and why phenomenal</i><br>
<i>&gt;sensations are, and can do things like objectively observe and eff</i><br>
<i>&gt;such feelings, we can't really accurately judge what is sentient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is not.  Do single celled animals have any such phenomenal</i><br>
<i>&gt;feelings or conscious knowledge?  I doubt it and would guess that</i><br>
<i>&gt;these are mostly simply mechanical.  What about insects?  Are they</i><br>
<i>&gt;purely abstractly mechanical or do they, too, experience some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;phenomenal feeling representations?  Where is the line drawn between</i><br>
<i>&gt;what can feel and what can't?  Until we know just what sensations are</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how they are employed by the various intelligent animals to</i><br>
<i>&gt;represent different kinds of knowledge and awareness, we can't yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;really know where to draw the line between what is and what isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient.</i><br>
<p>
I think the difference lies not in sensations or perceptions, but in higher<br>
level stuff -- i.e., the ability to form concepts, introspect, and all that<br>
stems from these.  I hate to sound like a hardcore Randian, but this<br>
does seem to make sense.  It would seem apes, dogs, etc. can perceive<br>
in much the same way we do -- albeit with a slightly different flavors of<br>
sensing the world.  Still, they have percepts.  What is needed is to<br>
decide if they can form concepts.  Linguistically, this amounts to more<br>
than an ability to associate words (whether as sounds, pictures, finger<br>
movement, odors, or what have you) and things or actions.  It would<br>
be indicated by the so far only known to be human capacity to form<br>
meaningful constructs from these and to combine them in new ways<br>
as well as to understand them when they are so combined.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Play God!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Yes definitely!  But shouldn't we be sure we are a good and</i><br>
<i>&gt;benevolent God?  I don't think we should ever only "uplift" to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited degree so that lower life forms can be left as such to only be</i><br>
<i>&gt;our slaves or servants or whatever.  There will be plenty of ways for</i><br>
<i>&gt;us all to do things mechanically without having to employ lessor</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient life forms to do slave labor.  If we have the right to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;uplifted via the help of other humans, I would think most lower</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals would deserve the same right.  The difference between a dog</i><br>
<i>&gt;and us is nothing compared to the difference between us and a God</i><br>
<i>&gt;right?</i><br>
<p>
For now.:)  Anyway, I was merely trying to be cute.  I would not want to<br>
make intelligent slaves anyway.  I would be pleased merely to see humans<br>
uplift various other organisms just for the fun of it.<br>
<p>
Onward and upliftwards!<br>
