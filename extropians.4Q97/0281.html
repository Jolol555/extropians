<p>
"Externalism" (temporary label) is not a science, and will remain unscientific<br>
- like all ethical systems - until an experimental method is invented. <br>
Externalism is not scientific, but it is loosely analogous to science.  In<br>
most ethical systems, philosophical thought takes the place of<br>
experimentation.  Thus they fail.  Philosophy isn't that powerful.  In my<br>
version of Externalism, intelligence enhancement acts as an interim substitute<br>
for experimentation.  Intelligence enhancement has the potential to be fully<br>
as powerful as experimentation and perhaps more so.<br>
<p>
But that isn't the reason.  The reason is that I'm too dumb to come up with an<br>
experimental method, and I have to recurse on the problem of becoming smarter.<br>
<p>
I realize that "thought without observation is as bad as observation without<br>
thought".  I reply that "intelligence enhancement without experimentation is<br>
as bad as experimentation without intelligence enhancement".  One can be an<br>
Externalist and a scientist both.<br>
<p>
Scientific technology is the key to enhancing intelligence.  Intelligence<br>
enhancement is the key to inventing experiments.  Which method one should use<br>
at a given time depends on whether experimentation or IA is easier; ideally,<br>
one should use both.  In the domain of "ethics", with current technology, IA<br>
is difficult but experimentation is impossible.<br>
