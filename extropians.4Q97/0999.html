[I was sending this to the extropy.org address for some odd reason.<br>
Profuse apologies to those might've seen it already.]<br>
<p>
I just finished a re-read of Prometheus Rising -- some thoughts and a<br>
question follow.<br>
<p>
Some philosophers seem to think that the "hard problem" of consciousness<br>
(how neural correlates give rise to subjective experience --<br>
<a href="http://sol.zynet.co.uk/imprint/hardprob.html">http://sol.zynet.co.uk/imprint/hardprob.html</a> ) is unsolvable until we<br>
know something about human perception. Perception is the mechanism that<br>
turns an objective reality into a subjective experience. So how we<br>
perceive a sensed event affects the internalized nature of the<br>
experience and in a feedback loop, the internalized nature of the<br>
experience affects our perception, and so on. In this way, (by way of a<br>
string of certain internalized experiences) some can be conditioned to<br>
"expect" a certain experience, and thus will perceive a sensed event as<br>
such. I'm reminded of the adage (and Eric Watt Forste's well-considered<br>
sign-off line) "Expectation foils perception."<br>
<p>
Prometheus Rising offers a number of exercises to alter our perceptive<br>
framework. Working with the eight circuit Leary-Wilson model outlined in<br>
that book, I've long known that the majority of my early imprints have<br>
been on the third (semantic) circuit. Accordingly, I've become prone to<br>
excessive rationalization, and the corresponding communicative<br>
roadblocks that can sometimes occur when dealing with first, second or<br>
fourth circuit types. I think RAW makes a great case for balance among<br>
the first four circuits, since such would allow more possibile<br>
perceptive frameworks through which to experience objective reality. The<br>
Holy Grail, of course, is the ability to switch between perceptive<br>
frameworks at will and in their entirety, allowing conscious exploration<br>
of reality from the standpoint of many different people. This is<br>
attractive in the sense that different people notice and internalize<br>
different things. If we could flip-flop between one perceptive framework<br>
and another, we would have a more accurate picture of the universe than<br>
any single-perspective person can have by themselves. Seems a step in<br>
the right transhuman direction. In fact, the idea of a single<br>
intelligence capable of synthesizing the internalized experiences of<br>
several people seems likely to crop up in nearly any discussion of the<br>
benefits of uploading.<br>
<p>
Whether this is possible, I haven't the faintest. So, has anyone<br>
attempted the perception re-training exercises in Prometheus Rising? If<br>
so, with what results?<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
