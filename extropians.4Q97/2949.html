Don't you see a glaring contradiction here?  The label "hypocrite"<br>
pops immediately to mind.<br>
<p>
(PS: Lorrey had written "preproduce".  I'm assuming that's a typo, and<br>
have corrected it.)<br>

<p>
This I'm not so sure about, but it may actually work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;c) Outlaw divorce while the children are minors.</i><br>
<p>
This is really rich, Michael.  "Live free or die", indeed.  Pray tell us,<br>
what brand of freedom is this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This would a) ensure</i><br>
<i>&gt;that people thought long and hard about getting married, ensuring that</i><br>
<i>&gt;only those truly commited would do it,</i><br>
<p>
Outlawing divorce does not ensure that people will think long and hard<br>
before getting married, any more than outlawing anything else makes<br>
people think long and hard before breaking the law.  Even smart people<br>
sometimes end up getting a divorce, no matter how hard they think about<br>
it beforehand.  This proposal is also unenforcable.  A marriage can<br>
exist on paper while the partners are separated.  Are you going to<br>
force the partners to live under the same roof, too, even if they can't<br>
get along?  Are you not willing to admit that sometimes it is better<br>
for a bad partnership to live apart?  What about joint custody, so that<br>
the child(ren) can still have both parents, just not simultaneously?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;b) eliminate the severe</i><br>
<i>&gt;strife that typically occurs between divorcees, using kids as the pawns,</i><br>
<p>
I think you have a warped view of what "typically occurs".  *Sometimes*<br>
children are used as pawns.  But I personally know people who are divorced,<br>
have joint custody, and seem to be doing just fine raising the kids.  Sure,<br>
it would be better if the parents got along and could live together.  But<br>
given that they can't, it seems better for them and for the children<br>
that they live peacefully apart rather than violently together.<br>
<p>
"Live Free or Die---except when you disagree with me."<br>
