In a message dated 97-10-22 01:54:08 EDT, you write:<br>
<i>&gt; Danny is apparently referring to a tetrahedron, not a triangle or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pyramid. Using a rough Earth radius of just under 4000 mi. (3957 mi. on</i><br>
<i>&gt; average, as the radius at the equator is slightly greater than at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; poles due to centrifugal stresses), and a rough moon radius of 1080</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles, a tetrahedron made to fit exactly inside the earth (within a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple dozen miles or so), would need a moon with a radius equal to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1333.333.... mi., so our moon is a couple hundred miles too small. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone can call me on the numbers please do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Since the Earth is/has been expnding, that would mean that perhaps in the<br>
past the relationship was accurate (given that the moon has been the same<br>
size since then, seeing how its solid cold, it appears that way), I wonder<br>
when the date of that was.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; If these numbers are right, this is a good example, Danny, of how<br>
<i> &gt; "sacred geometry" is bogus because they use bogus math, the don't do</i><br>
<i> &gt; their homework. I suggest that you do yours so you don't get hoodwinked</i><br>
<i> &gt; by this sort of stuff.</i><br>
<i> &gt; -- &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No, sacred geometry uses correct numbers, true sacred geometry.  Why would<br>
they use wrong numbers/equations?  I was referring to a picture at a web<br>
site, thats all, they obviously just did it to look cool, i wanted to know if<br>
it was a correct relationship.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is not to say that all such relationships are bogus. I have a gut</i><br>
<i>&gt;feeling that Bode's law may have an underlying cause based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanics of the original solar accretion disk.</i><br>
<p>
Do you mean the disk that formed the planets?  What is Bode's law?  I feel<br>
the same way,  I also believe there's a lot going on in saturn's rings, given<br>
the braided rings, and god knows what else.  Oh, there's also high voltage<br>
bursts emanating from saturn that is synchronistic with a specific place on<br>
the ring.<br>
