: "When does theft become property?"  Is a touchy issue.<br>
: If the Federal government doesn't "really" own something because they<br>
: stole it decades ago, what's to stop a member of a racial minority from<br>
: claiming that I don't "really" own my car, because it was bought with<br>
: money from my job, which I obtained partially thanks to my education,<br>
: which I obtained partially due to my priviledged upbringing and parent's<br>
: income, which priviledge was partially due to race, because white people<br>
: have several economic and social advantages over other races in this<br>
: country, because our ancestors committed theft, forced slavery, and<br>
: several other crimes?<br>
<p>
You could ask the "victim" whether they'd be happier in whichever<br>
kleptocracy their African ancestral homeland has become.<br>
<p>
I'm in the same boat: child of White professionals, who got me<br>
a (tax-subsidized) college education with their (tax-subsidized)<br>
academic salaries.  On another hand, I'd probably be just as good<br>
at my present job if I'd never been to college at all.<br>
<p>
But can't I escape the charge of benefitting from slavery, on the grounds<br>
that I'm descended from Quakers (who, as far as I know, were consistently<br>
anti-slavery) and later immigrants (who came from Scandinavia after<br>
slavery was abolished)?<br>
<p>
: While ingenuity, hard work, etc., contribute to ownership, isn't<br>
: there always also a correlation with one-time theft, albeit sometimes<br>
: abstracted by quite a few layers?<br>
<p>
Not unless you use a broad definition of "theft".  In America, the <br>
socioeconomic rank of a family has a very low correlation with that<br>
of the same family only three generations before.<br>
