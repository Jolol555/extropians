<i>&gt;I'm not much of an investor, but my sense is that this correction will</i><br>

<p>
 Declines that last months generally require triggers such as rising<br>
real interest rates, a recession, or a war. This is especially true<br>
after a long bull market. I haven't seen anything that would cause a<br>
sustained change in U.S. investor psychology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One interesting difference from the 1987 crash is the use of trading</i><br>
<i>&gt;halts.  This was a controversial measure put into place after that crash.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea is that the crash is motivated by irrational panic, and that by</i><br>
<i>&gt;halting trading for a while, reason will return.  It's an unusual theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;because it is based on the assumption that investors are irrational,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is contrary to the assumptions generally used in analyzing markets.</i><br>
<p>
 The assumption of irrationality is probably the main motivation behind<br>
trading halts, but I can think of an alternative.<br>
 Many of the people selling at the bottom are using a very simple rule<br>
(they no longer have enough equity to back their margin debt), and<br>
brokers tend to give high priority to alerting investors to this.<br>
 On the other hand, people buying because stocks have become cheap<br>
want to compare a number of stocks to find the ones most underpriced,<br>
and the communications needed to alert them that stocks have suddenly<br>
become cheap can easily be slower.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It could be that these holds and shutdowns may make the psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt;factors even worse.  If the market is falling, at least you can assume</i><br>
<i>&gt;that at any given moment the valuation approximately reflects people's</i><br>
<p>
 Another way that trading halts can accelerate declines is that people<br>
who think they may be forced to sell to cover margin debts feel greater<br>
urgency if they expect they won't be able to sell if they wait.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think now is a good time to buy.  Although recent drops have</i><br>
<i>&gt;been followed by quick recoveries, I don't think that will be the case</i><br>
<i>&gt;this time.  It should be possible to get a much better deal in a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;months, although by then the psychology will have turned so that no one</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be very excited in stocks at that time (which is itself a time to</i><br>
<i>&gt;start buying).</i><br>
<p>
 I did some buying this morning.<br>
