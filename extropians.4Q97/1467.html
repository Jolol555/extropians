Since I am new to this list, I feel it might be better to start a thread, then<br>
pickup with the current discussions.  I know many would be trans-<br>
humanists are interested in uplifting -- i.e., making a nonsentient species<br>
sentient.  I am too.  (I know there must be stuff/web pages out there on<br>
this already, so forgive any redundancies.  And point them out to me!:)<br>
<p>
Often when I tell people about this -- and not just anyone, but people I<br>
think might share an interest in it or at least be able to talk about it in a<br>
sensible way -- they see it as either pointless or insane.  Pointless,<br>
because we already have humans.  No need to reinvent the mind...:)<br>
Insane, because they think it might akin to putting a human in a non-<br>
human body.  Imagine putting your mind in the body of a weasel.  Sure,<br>
it might be nice for a romp in the park, has potential if you want to <br>
solve your rodent problem in an exciting way, but the limitations!<br>
<p>
My arguments for uplifting -- and believe me, my interest is pedestrian:<br>
I'm not losing sleep over this, come what may:) -- are threefold.  I see it<br>
as a way to experiment on minds in general.  The pay off here is that<br>
if we can uplift, say, a dog, then hopefully, the technology/technique<br>
will carry over into intelligence enhancement in humans.<br>
<p>
Next, uplifted dogs, to stick with my example, would also be good for<br>
lots of things that might be done by humans but that a dog's abilities<br>
are better at (e.g., guarding property), but which current robots are<br>
not yet up to.<br>
<p>
Third, the gains for the culture/memescape might be great.  We get<br>
the bonus of an added perspective.  This is almost like using genetic<br>
algorithmns to design bridges as opposed to human engineering. The<br>
dog perspective on the world will help up to expand the limits of ours.<br>
<p>
Those are my quickie reasons for uplifting.  I look forward to your<br>
input/feedback.<br>
