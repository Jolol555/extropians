I spent six years in Seattle, and spent a good amount of time all over<br>
Puget Sound. Orcas do not spend much time inside the Sound itself. THey<br>
typically only venture in when the salmon are running(a couple months in<br>
the late summer), to chase schools into small bays or entrapping<br>
underwater features. I do know that each pod develops its own calls and<br>
dialects, but there is still undestanding of some sort between pods, as<br>
sound carries a long ways underwater, and they have to know where other<br>
pods are to give each ohter wide berth. There is a species of dolphin<br>
that has a similar color scheme as orcas, but is smaller. THis may be<br>
the source of the confusion.<br>
