I think I was writing a little deeper than you were bothering to read. I<br>
meant each example to be a different kind of selection pressure:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Is the Rotary a cult? is the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;cult? Is 4-H a cult? Is the specialty-certified service station I take my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;car to a cult? How about the letters-to-the-Editor column of Scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;American?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Individuals without the funds to pay yearly 4-H dues are usually given a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rider. </i><br>
<p>
That's not my point here. My point here (made more clear by a part of my<br>
post you elided :) is<br>
that 4-H "tries to tell people how to live" at least as much as any ExI<br>
member I've ever met. Possibly more.<br>
Regardless of that, the "dues" all members pay in 4-H do exist, and are<br>
those of conforming to the mores of the US American agricultural heartland.<br>
Be a rotten enough kid, and they _will_ suggest you do something else with<br>
your time...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And anyone is allowed and invited to write to the letters column of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientific American. They don't limit the discussion to sub'ed members.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but again you miss my point. Which is, in this example, that the<br>
letters are *edited*; another selection pressure, and based on the author's<br>
letter's value being judged by the editor. The "dues" here are more<br>
abstract yet strangely familiar given the prior case: fitting (or _being<br>
fit into_) into the editorial categorization scheme... "What KIND of letter<br>
is this? How well does it sound to me (the editor) when I read it loud?" Etc.<br>
<p>
I run several mailing lists for the user groups/professional orgs I am<br>
<i>&gt;involved with. If done properly, it takes almost no effort after the</i><br>
<i>&gt;initial setup/tweaking.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, now I don't seem to understand what _your_ point is. Somebody<br>
_already_ runs this list, no? :)<br>
