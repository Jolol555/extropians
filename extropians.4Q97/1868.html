<i>&gt;Very interesting stuff indeed, from what little I've read.  I find it to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be quite congruent with, and complementary to, the studies of focused</i><br>
<i>&gt;attention one finds in the literature of meditation.  Particularly the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept found in Buddhist (vipasana) and Zen meditation of constant</i><br>
<i>&gt;mindfulness or bare and precise attention at all moments of</i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness.  It seems to me (without having gone through a</i><br>
<i>&gt;practitioner training myself) that the NLP focus on detailed observation</i><br>
<i>&gt;could serve to develop these faculties.</i><br>
<p>
Never having formally done Zen or vipanasa, all I can say is that the<br>
congruency has occurred to me as a possibility, too. The hazards seem<br>
similar, too--am I falling asleep? am I ego-tripping? am I only kidding<br>
myself that I am seeing something at a particular time?<br>
<p>
But some approaches invite a kind of relaxed split attention, which is<br>
probably not true Zen: you still have a little agenda nudging you along,<br>
whether that's playfulness or generative change or whatever.<br>
<p>
One simple (silly?) example, illustrative of the kinds of things Grinder,<br>
Delozier &amp; Associates were using as, I think, a combination of warm-up<br>
exercise and research: without letting it become the exclusive focus of<br>
attention, see if you can, in the course of a normal conversation,<br>
correlate the other person's lip dimensions and color with some aspect of<br>
the communication you are having. Make a determination. Complete the<br>
conversation. Check your results with another person doing the same<br>
exercise with that particular person.<br>
<p>
No guarantee is made that you will see the same thing. But isn't it<br>
interesting what a room full of people can (think?) they see? Did everybody<br>
just groupthink their way along? Hmmmm.<br>
<p>
And I remember sharply the discovery that "simple" is not identical with<br>
"easy". :) :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hmmm, I'm interested in reading the results of even poor-methodology</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies in the area.  Any references would be appreciated.</i><br>
<p>
I don't have the info ready at hand. Third-party accounts disagree over<br>
what the results meant, but that in itself means little. I'll post to the<br>
group if I find good source material.<br>
