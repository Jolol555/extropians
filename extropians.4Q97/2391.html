<i>&gt; From:          Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think less drastic measures are more effective (if you remove one</i><br>
<i>&gt; idiot, two takes his place); we should both demand better designs</i><br>
<i>&gt; and try to promote good design (as you all know, I'm constantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheering HCI as one of the most important &gt;H areas). We need both</i><br>
<i>&gt; positive and negative fitness gradients.</i><br>
<p>
Hm... I assume you are regarding HCI as one of the negative <br>
gradients, as they have never designed anything which would not be <br>
counterproductive to their alleged purpose.<br>
<p>
Or perhaps you have some inside knowledge about their TRUE purpose?  <br>
(There are enough people in that group, of sufficient intelligence, <br>
that I cannot believe ALL of them are unaware of how their public <br>
actions oppose their public purpose.  Unfortunately, the alternative <br>
belief is that some of them -- and I don't know which ones -- are <br>
committing intellectual fraud rather than intellectual error.)<br>
