Wow! (I think that's already been said ;)<br>
I never really thought of any one person doing more for humanity than any<br>
other in history.  Bill Gates is an interesting choice.  If I had to<br>
choose, I would say the most important man in history would be someone who<br>
spread the most infectious pro-science, pro-free market,<br>
pro-individualist memes. (any ideas?)  Although he is a good model of the<br>
modern capitalist (exluding government deals), I wouldn't say there are<br>
too many people out there who have been profoundly influences by his<br>
memes.  Maybe I'm wrong?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Absent actual physical coercion,</i><br>
<p>
Is a hypnotic or subliminal advertisement "physical coercion"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; absolutely anything one does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; cajole as many people as possible to give you money--voluntarily--</i><br>
<i>&gt; is, by definition, providing a benefit to them.</i><br>
<p>
What benefit are con artists to their victims?  <br>
<p>
I see what you are trying to say, but I think you have made too general a<br>
statement.<br>
<p>
Maybe you could make a more specific economic statement like : "Humanity<br>
reaps the greatest benefits when the market is consistently cleared<br>
(supply=demand) and productive output per capita is maximized."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Except to the small</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent of MS's government contracts (a /very/ small part of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; business) which are not paid for voluntarily, every penny of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world's richest man's fortune came from people who /chose/ to give</i><br>
<i>&gt; it because they derived benefit from his products.</i><br>
<p>
Can't argue with that.  I don't really wish death to Microsoft, just<br>
healthy competition.  Maybe Linux will go public? (or has it already?)  Of<br>
course, if I really want competition that badly, I'll have to start<br>
writing that new OS right now...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Regardless of</i><br>
<i>&gt; how grudgingly they may have felt about being locked in, or how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; they lied to themselves about wanting reliable software (no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; really wants reliable software, they just think they do), the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that they signed the checks.</i><br>
<p>
True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems<br>
to be an example of positive feedback: the more people have Microsoft<br>
software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have compatible<br>
software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?<br>
(which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Despite the fact that Microsoft never really invented anything novel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignores standards, bullies its competitors, and does lots of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; things people might not like, the world would be a much darker and</i><br>
<i>&gt; poorer place without heroes like Gates,</i><br>
<p>
But not necessarily Gates.  If Gates didn't do it, someone else probably<br>
would have.  The question is: would they have done a better job?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; who do the Right Thing for</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever reasons.  Motives don't count--results do, and Bill Gates</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets results.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When I awake from my suspension, I'd much rather see a world with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Gates than some worthless whiner like Marc Andreesen.</i><br>
<p>
Pardon my ignorance... who's Marc Andreesen?<br>
<p>
(maybe this is a good example of who has had the better memes?)<br>
