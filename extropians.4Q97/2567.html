    Just wondering a few things myself.  Number one, why do you carry a gun.<br>
You mentioned that private ownership of a fire arm reduces violent crime.  I<br>
don't mean to jump on your case, but do you realize that there would probably<br>
be a drastic reduction in violent crime altogether if guns or any such weapon<br>
didn't even exist.  I know obviously that guns are too much a part of our<br>
society to just eliminate all together, but just think for a moment about for<br>
what purpose the gun was originated - to kill.  Regardless of wether or not<br>
you try to argue its value as a defensive tool, an item of sport, etc., its<br>
main purpose is, and will remain to kill.  The problem with our society is<br>
we've slowly become so programmed and so desensitized over the years we don't<br>
even think twice on the matters.<br>
    I'd like to think personally that the human race is entering a new wave<br>
of evolution mentally.  I hope that you could clearly see, if there ever is a<br>
totally unified society, it's not going to work unless we get rid of weapons<br>
of mass destruction, starting with guns. You say the fact that it was<br>
originated to "maim and kill" is more or less outdated.  Well what is its<br>
purpose then, to sit on your mantel, looking bright and shiny?  For sport?  A<br>
sybmol of power.  Let me clear something up, you see, the reason a gun is<br>
built just so, and bullets are produced, is because those bullets are<br>
supposed to escape the barrel of that gun at high velocity, destroying, and<br>
KILLING what's in its path.<br>
    I'm sure you could argue quite well the many good points to owning a<br>
firearm, many argue it's a basic human right, part of the constitution; well<br>
times have changed my friend.  Just think about when the constition was<br>
written, think about what was going on - war.  There are certain basic<br>
statements in the consitition that will remane valid for a long time to come,<br>
but the more specific the statment, the more room there is for it to become<br>
invalid sooner.  The constition states that all men are created equal, yet<br>
slavery was excused for many, many years.  Changes are made to accomodate the<br>
times, and what becomes morally acceptable as time goes on.<br>
    Man started with a club, and from that more sophisticated tools, swords,<br>
then muskets, machine guns, grenades, mortars, tanks, planes, jets, atomic<br>
bombs capable of whiping out mass amounts of peole and causing mass<br>
distruction.  It's inevitable that with guns come other weapons.  Imgaine if<br>
these weapons had never been invented, imagine how many wars could have been,<br>
and will be avoided if men walked onto the battle field armed only with a<br>
sword.  When you don't have the comfort a multi-billion dollar war plane to<br>
aid you so you don't have too see the faces of all the human beings you kill,<br>
you tend to think twice about going to war.<br>
    Now I know you're not concering yourself with this, and you probably<br>
think I'm getting way too into this, but the fact is, this is all tied in<br>
with, and roots from guns and the concept of weapons.  You look down on those<br>
who oppose the use of personal hand guns, saying the laws passed to protect<br>
actually end up working against them.  Sorry but I fail to see the logic in<br>
the statement that those who fight against weapons have more blood on THEIR<br>
hands than those who produce and use them.  Logic.  How can someone who has<br>
never touched a weapon have more blood on their hands if what they had been<br>
pushing for had succeded, and there were no weapons to spill any blood to<br>
begin with.  Hello, get rid of guns all together and imagine just how much<br>
more blood won't be spilt.  There is no valid purpose today to own or use a<br>
gun, unless you are an enforcer of the law, and it is absolutely dire that<br>
you need to use one.  Many argue they use them for sport.  Do you think that<br>
perhaps it might be too much to ask, to give up such a sport that it might<br>
save thousands upon thousands of lives.  What about the tragic stories of<br>
children getting ahold of guns.  The UN peace keeper shot down in Africa by a<br>
small boy weilding a gun, who didn't even know any better. Perhaps you,<br>
yourself, are a responsible firearm owner, congrats, but for every gun that<br>
falls into the hands of  a responsible owner many more fall into the hands of<br>
irresponsible owners.  Do you think that gangs would be as previlent today if<br>
the members went around armed with wooden sticks?  Sure a firearm protects<br>
people from crime, but ever stop to think crime would probably be a lot less<br>
acceptable and convenient with out the ability to end a life with a flick of<br>
the finger.<br>
    Ok well, sorry, I'd like to make it clear im not responding to you<br>
individually, this was just a chance for me to jump in this.  I just tend to<br>
think gun owners exuse the mishaps of guns in general by blaming it on the<br>
owner, which is probably very, very true.  BUT.  When you agree to accept<br>
guns, wether you like it or not, you are indirectly fueling a lot of<br>
violence, and a lot of death.  Think about how many guns are sold to third<br>
world countries, not motivated by soley a concern for the country, but more<br>
or less - profit.  Life is amazing, and a tremendous amount of effort goes<br>
into creating it, and a tool that can end it instantly, that was designed to<br>
do just that, to me, is plain wrong.  Perhaps if people repected that power<br>
it wouldn't be such an issue, but you know and I know that they don't.  What<br>
happens in the future if there is an uprising, I'd hope, and I hope you would<br>
too, that we could come together and solve our differenecs through logic, and<br>
intelligence, compromise, rather than by shear force, death, and fear.  If<br>
we, as an intelligent people, are never able to come together to resolve<br>
conflict in a peaceful manner, than I've given up all hope.<br>
