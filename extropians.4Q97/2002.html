Only in a closed system.  Your prigoginic universe -- one side as a dump, the<br>
other to live in -- is merely a closed system on a higher level.  The<br>
possibility<br>
Layzer discusses -- the expanding phase space idealization -- is not closed<br>
on any level.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But</i><br>
<i>&gt;regions can achieve as much order as they want if they have energy and</i><br>

<p>
No.  The point is Is the expansion rate fast enough to insure the universe<br>
will never reach equilibrium.  Layzer thinks it is.  (For the record, his model<br>
of cosmology is called the Cold Big Bang.  See his _Cosmogenesis_ for<br>
a lay account.  He also presents his view in his _Constructing the<br>
Universe_.)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; To picture what I am talking about imagine a bunch of molecules in a</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; certain amount of time, ceterus paribus, they will be spread out -- in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the sense one would be likely to find them anywhere within the box.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This would be an equilibrium state -- or more, accurately, collection of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; states.  Now imagine that the box can expand faster than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; molecules move.  The molecules will never be able to fill the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; box, in the sense of the first example.  One will always be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; give a rough estimate of where they are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Now if the universe as a whole behaved like that...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that would be nice. Unfortunately this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ball-of-galaxies-expanding-from-a-center-somewhere-in-a-big-void-model,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and not compatible with what we know or believe. The universe seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be expanding more like a big balloon with galaxies on its surface,</i><br>
<i>&gt;being slowly blown up. That means we do not get any low-entropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;regions for free, even when the spacetime expands. A pity.</i><br>
<p>
The box example is merely an analogy as is the "big balloon with galaxies<br>
on its surface."  BTW, the latter assumes the universe is positively<br>
curved, which is what we were questioning!<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, if the "ballon" can expand forever at a rate faster than<br>
equilibrating interactions, then the same result occurs.  I.e., there is no<br>
heat death, expansion and order growth are eternal.<br>
