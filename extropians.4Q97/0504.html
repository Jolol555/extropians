<i>&gt; I think the problem is a lot of you have closed minds and when you see</i><br>
<i>&gt; a post from "CALYK.@aol.com" you immediately enter "bias mode".  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; like, people have ALWAYS been persecuted for sharing new exotic things</i><br>
<i>&gt; with people, like a "round world".</i><br>
<p>
I will confirm your suspicion; that's exactly what I think, now.<br>
Credibility is earned, and so is the lack of it.  You have earned<br>
the privilege of bias because you have shown extreme credulity in<br>
the face of hard evidence, and your quotes on the matter are in<br>
the archives for all to see.<br>
<p>
Sure, it would be wonderful if there were things like alien<br>
visitors or cars that run on water, but no less wonderful than<br>
other spectacular things like cell repair nanobots, intelligent<br>
computers, genetically engineered humans, fusion energy.  These<br>
equally spectacular things we judge worthy of discussion because<br>
their proponents have /earned/ their credibility.  I can redo<br>
Drexler's or Feynman's equations and they come out the same; I<br>
can look up the numbers they quote in the CRC tables and find<br>
that they are correct.<br>
<p>
Why waste time on fantasy when reality is just as miraculous?<br>
