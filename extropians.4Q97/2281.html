<i>&gt;  (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;know. Braking distance is about 100 meters, visibility about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;same. Someone on the backseat claims that there is an obstacle</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ahead but can't tell whether it's something solid or just a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thickening of the fog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;whatever...) and the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not going to slow down because some backseater 'thinks' he sees</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something. So here we are rushing toward an object that could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall of concrete. After</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;some discussion the still unclear object is now to close</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for a full stop, the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;happens' or the ask the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;at the lowest speed possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the damage (if any).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmmm.... not a problem for the 1999 Synergy Hypercar, since it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward looking collision avoidance radar will alert/brake you in</i><br>
<i>&gt; case of any imminent danger. Besides, it's composite monocoque</i><br>
<i>&gt; chassis/passive restraint system is years ahead of anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufactured just two years ago. Not only that, but since each</i><br>
<i>&gt; wheel/hub is an individual electric motor/generator (used for</i><br>
<i>&gt; regenerative braking) the stopping distance is much less.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the object ahead is a bull moose. 1100 lbs of bone and<br>
meat and huge antlers. Unlike a stationary object, he moves around, and<br>
unlike another vehicle, he tends to move in whatever direction your or<br>
your fancy schmantzy collision avoidance computer thnks he's not going<br>
to move in. The papier mache thin body of your vehicle crumples like<br>
toilet paper when it hits, and since its low body hits the legs, the<br>
body of Bullwinkle comes crashing down on top of the car, crushing the<br>
cockpit and breaking the backs or smaching the skulls of everyone who is<br>
pinned in their seats by their superduper airbags.<br>
<p>
For those of you who don't put any credence in this scenario, I happen<br>
to live in a state where moose browsing around downtown is a frequent<br>
occurence. There are Moose areas where road signs warning of the local<br>
pedestrian traffic have additional signs below them that remind me of a<br>
MacDOnalds restaurant: "Hundreds of Collisions".<br>
<p>
BTW: If anyone wants a digital photo of one of these, email me. Specify<br>
day or night shot....<br>
<p>
A guy died recently from hitting a moose with his 1/2 ton pickup truck.<br>
Imagine what would happen to a little toy like Mr. Super-duper<br>
Electromobile.<br>
<p>
Recently, many consumer groups are targeting Sport Utility Vehicles,<br>
because they are involved in more deadly accidents than normal cars.<br>
They fail to mention that the fatalities happen to the OTHER guy, in<br>
that tuna-can rice burner. SUV's have the lowest passenger and driver<br>
fatalities of all vehicles. Funny how they misrepresent the statistics.<br>
WOuldn't have a prejudice to further would they???? <br>
