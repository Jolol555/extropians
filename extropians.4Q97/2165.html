<p>
photons are only considered particles in that the energy they contain is<br>
equivalent to a given amount of mass via e=mc^2. When you stop a photon,<br>
it has mass because you've taken all of its energy away. It is going<br>
nowhere and falls back into the space-time continuum.<br>
<p>
Now, this brings up a big difference between light and solid matter with<br>
regards to black holes. As far as we know, light cannot escape a black<br>
hole, because the singularity drains all energy from the photons to the<br>
point that they cannot be detected in the visible spectrum. However, if<br>
you have a toroidal black hole such that matter can pass through from<br>
pole to pole, conservation of momentum dictates that the matter should<br>
retain most of its momentum, and reemerge from the other side (or if a<br>
wormhole is formed, out of the other hole). As wacky as this sounds,<br>
even Hawking has posited this possibility....<br>
