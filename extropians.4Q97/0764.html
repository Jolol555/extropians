One rare syndrome that causes "clinical manifestations that resemble<br>
premature aging in humans" is called Werner's syndrome (WS). <br>
Werner's syndrome and progeria are apparently distinct but both cause<br>
premature aging. See:<br>
<a href="http://medinfo.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/posts/archives/mar97/852909270.Me.r.html">http://medinfo.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/posts/archives/mar97/852909270.Me.r.html</a><br>
<p>
Recently, excellent progress has been made in understanding Werner's<br>
syndrome.  See: <a href="http://www.bioscience.org/news/scientis/aging1.htm">http://www.bioscience.org/news/scientis/aging1.htm</a><br>
<p>
The Werner's syndrome gene (WRN) has been identified and it is similar<br>
to DNA helicases.<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
Helicases are involved in DNA replication, recombination, chromosome<br>
segregation, DNA repair, transcription or any function that requires<br>
unwinding of the DNA. In view of similarity to helicases, the WRN<br>
protein may exert similar functions in cells. Yu et al suggest that<br>
the consequence of the defect in WS patients may be the accumulation<br>
of DNA mutations that ultimately lead to the age-related<br>
manifestations of this disorder.  Somatic mutations of oncogenes and<br>
tumor suppressor genes may be the underlying basis for the increased<br>
incidence of cancer seen in these patients. The DNA damage may also be<br>
responsible for premature replicative senescence and consequent<br>
pathologies. Whether the WRN gene is implicated in the normal aging<br>
process remains to be seen, however, the new discovery undoubtedly<br>
will shed light on the pathways that lead to the premature aging in<br>
patients with WS.<br>

Further evidence that the Werner's syndrome gene codes for a DNA<br>
helicase appears in the August 1, 1997 edition of Nucleic Acids<br>
Research Online.  Article title : "DNA helicase activity in Werner's<br>
syndrome gene product synthesized in a baculovirus system" by Noriyuki<br>
Suzuki, Akira Shimamoto, Osamu Imamura, Junro Kuromitsu, Saori Kitao,<br>
Makoto Goto1 and Yasuhiro Furuichi<br>

<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
The gene responsible for Werner's syndrome (WRN) contains a region<br>
homologous to the Escherichia coli RecQ type DNA helicase and was<br>
thought to code for a DNA helicase belonging to this helicase<br>
family. However, no evidence has been shown before to substantiate<br>
this prediction. Here, we show data that the product of the WRN gene<br>
is indeed a DNA helicase.<br>

Switching topics. The topic of telomeres comes up on this list<br>
periodically.  Telomeres and telomerase are relevant to cancer<br>
research, aging research, and cloning. Science News, October 11, 1997,<br>
reports (based on an article in Cell) that telomerase-deficient mice<br>
have been created and six generations have been bred.<br>
The results are controversial. See:<br>
