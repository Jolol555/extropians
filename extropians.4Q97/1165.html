This discussion would be a __lot_ easier and more fruitful if you'd take the  <br>
trouble to read any high school science book or at least a good grade school  <br>
one.            <br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The 2 slit interference experiment.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Popper explains this neatly with propensities. Propensities are real         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;properties, albeit a little like 'hidden variables.'  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But there is no way Newton or Galileo of Faraday or Maxwell can explain this: Shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it<br>
will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, even if the photons <br>
are sent out one at a time. If a photon (or an electron) goes through one <br>
slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go <br>
though, was there or not, but it does!<br>
<p>
Or place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and one set at  <br>
90 degrees over the other, and the interference pattern disappears. Now place  <br>
a third filter set at 45 degrees between the slits and the film and wait  <br>
until AFTER the photons have passed the slits to do it. The interference  <br>
pattern comes back! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not enter in any <br>
of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we just don't  <br>
know which one, it goes through both slits, and neither. <br>
<p>
Don't tell me that all this is crazy because it's not my fault, I'm sure I  could have done much better but unfortunately I was<br>
not given the job. Tell God He's crazy.             <br>
        <br>
A word about philosophers; I like them, especially Popper, I always find that<br>
sort of stuff entertaining, but Stephen Hawking has some amusing things to  <br>
say about them that contain more than a little truth.<br>
- From "Black Holes and Baby Universes:<br>
<p>
 "philosophers have mostly not had enough mathematical background to keep up  <br>
  with modern developments in theoretical physics. There is a subspecies   <br>
  called philosophers of science who ought to be better equipped. But many of <br>
  them are failed physicist who found it too hard to invent new theories and <br>
  so took to writing the philosophy of physics instead. They are still  <br>
  arguing about the scientific theories of the early years of this century,  <br>
  like relativity and quantum mechanics. They are not in touch with the  <br>
  present frontier of physics."<br>

<i>        &gt;A dice has a propensity of one in six to come up 6. The _physics_ of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;dice throws is very complex.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The 2 slit experiment is not complex and complexity has nothing to do with it.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Electrons only 'spiral into the nucleus' in aether theory.       </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Newton says an object moving in a circle is accelerating toward the center of <br>
the circle. Maxwell says an accelerating charge will radiate an <br>
electromagnetic wave and give up energy. BUT...<br>
<p>
An electron is a charge. The electron does not usually radiate an  <br>
electromagnetic wave. The electron does not give up energy. The electron <br>
does  not spiral into the nucleus.                 <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In Relational Mechanics, they're held in various orbits of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;near-constant radius by electric force         </i><br>
   <br>
<p>
The electron has a negative charge. <br>
The nucleus has a positive charge.       <br>
The electric force pulls the electron and nucleus together.<br>
The electron and nucleus do not come together. <br>
Something else must be stopping them.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Relational Mechanics handles lasing easily.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But the margin of your E mail message was too small to contain the marvelous <br>
proof of it that you discovered.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The Michelson-Morley experiment perfectly corroborates the ballistic         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;theory of light.  Doesn't everyone know  this?          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, everyone doesn't know this.                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Sheesh!!!  Gravitational redshift is perfectly predicted by the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ballistic theory of light.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
This said from a man who thinks a red filter produces a redshift.                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The detection of gravity waves by Taylor and Hulse for which they         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;won the Nobel Prize in 1995.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But this is an _emprirical_ matter   </i><br>
<p>
Rather a cavalier attitude to take toward experimental results from someone <br>
who claims he's scientific don't you think.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>          &gt;on which Relational Mechanics takes no position   </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Then you've been beaten by the competition because General Relativity did <br>
take a position, it predicted the gravity waves would exist and said exactly <br>
how intense they'd be. Taylor and Hulse proved the prediction correct.  <br>
<p>
<p>
In my last post I mentioned the orbit of Mercury and said:  <br>
" General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21"<br>
<p>
Tony responded to my comment with the following:<br>
                                 <br>
<i>      &gt;The point you insist on ignoring is that the velocity of propagation       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;of gravitational force (if any) is not a feature of Classical or       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;Relational Mechanics. In Newton's theory, gravity acts instantaneously       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;at a distance (even though he also says that it doesn't, because that       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;would have been 'occult' and could have gotten him executed).  Stop   </i><br>
<i>      &gt;conflating incompatible propositions, fer Chrissake!!!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's English, I recognize the words and it seems to obey the rules of  <br>
grammar, but if anybody has an idea of what the above could mean I wish  <br>
they'd drop me a line.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Sheesh!!! Time is a _dimension_.  You never studied Dimensional         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Analysis?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You say time is a dimension and you say it's a dimension that doesn't measure <br>
anything. You might as well say time is a teapot. I'm going to  repeat my <br>
question and see if you'll answer it this time, but you'll probably just say <br>
"ballistic theory" has it all figured out or point to another philosophy book.    <br>
<p>
If this thing you call "time" is not a measure of how particles of matter and <br>
energy interact, such as the particles in my clock my body my brain or my <br>
world, then why should I be the slightest bit interest in it? <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;'time dilation' is positivistic. I don't buy into positivistic stuff         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it's all obsolete.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I close by quoting again from Stephen Hawking's book:       <br>
<p>
  "I have been variously called a nominalist, an instrumentalist, <br>
   a positivist, a realist, and several other ists. The technique seems <br>
   to be refutation by denigration: If you can attach a label to my <br>
   approach, you don't have to say what is wrong with it. Surely everyone <br>
   knows the fatal errors of all those isms. The people who actually make <br>
   the advances in theoretical physics don't think in the categories that <br>
   the philosophers and historians of science subsequently invent for them. <br>
   I am sure that Einstein, Heisenberg, and Dirac didn't worry about whether <br>
   they were realists or instrumentalists. They were simply concerned that <br>
   the existing theories didn't fit together"        <br>
