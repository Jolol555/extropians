<i>&gt; As I see it, the issue and focal point is this: I see the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept, morality, as definitively and inherently attached to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; illusory, but much believed concept, superior being; a concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; many variations often far removed from formal religion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consequently, the derivative concepts, inferior being,</i><br>
<i>&gt; subordination and rule are anti individual and inevitably</i><br>
<i>&gt; culminate in hostility and violent conflict.</i><br>
<p>
Flaws in attacks on "objective morality" can usually be detected by<br>
substituting "reality" for "morality".  The same religions attach the concept<br>
of "objective reality" to God (or similar entity), first by stating that God<br>
is objectively real, and second by stating that God created reality and has<br>
absolute control over it.  This doesn't mean that the concept of "objective<br>
reality" is indefeasibly predicated on the existence of God.<br>
<p>
Likewise, religions state that their morality is objective and that God gets<br>
to define objective morality.  This does not mean that objective morality<br>
requires a God; it means that the religion in question thinks so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The concept,</i><br>
<i>&gt; morality, itself presumes to set an alleged natural standard, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thus presumes to displace individual preference. This is the root</i><br>
<i>&gt; premise of subordination and rule. If peace and harmony is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal sought, this belief system is bad news.</i><br>
<p>
The key fallacy is not the assumed existence of objective morality, but that<br>
your particular morality is objective.<br>
<p>
Science is the middle path between the harsh tyranny of unquestionable "truth"<br>
and the useless undisprovability of "subjective" reality.  Science states that<br>
there exists an objective reality, but we do not know what it is.  My ethical<br>
system makes the same statement with respect to morality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Isn't  truth quite simply an idea or belief that conforms to</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective reality?  The recourse to alleged "dual definitions" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; an indirect admission that "moral truth" (often referred to as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "spiritual truth") is in conflict with "metaphysical or logical</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth." In other words, fallacy.  At this juncture, I will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursue further, but suffice it to say until I see a second</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective reality, which is necessary to give the "second truth"</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitive meaning, I reject without equivocation the idea and</i><br>
<i>&gt; all that is attached to it.</i><br>
<p>
Absolute agreement over here.  Science is the art of not making excuses when<br>
you're wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Getting to the mission at hand, the "problem words" currently in</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus are: good, bad, (evil) moral,(good) immoral (evil). A</i><br>
<i>&gt; saturate teaching that one is subjected to from infancy on is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea of "the forces of good and evil."  This teaching sets "good</i><br>
<i>&gt; and evil" as objective and constant universal elements. This idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not only promoted in formal religion citing an omni god as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "ultimate good", the idea is promoted to saturation by "community</i><br>
<i>&gt; values", "national interest", "values of society" and a host of</i><br>
<i>&gt; other "divine abstracts" reinforcing the emotional impression of</i><br>
<i>&gt; values existing independently of individual; values that express</i><br>
<i>&gt; or imply a superior being; values that individuals are programmed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to believe they "ought" to hold. As false as this whole scenario</i><br>
<i>&gt; is, it is usually a lock that binds the mind to "duty."</i><br>
<p>
Any fanatic will claim that his views are objective fact.  That doesn't mean<br>
we should throw out the concept of objective reality.  Just because objective<br>
morality has been abused doesn't mean it isn't useful - we just need to be<br>
careful, that's all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the real world of</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual and subjective value, the term value always asks the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question: value to whom for what purpose. Value is not something</i><br>
<i>&gt; existing independently of individual and inherent in a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstance. To speak definitively of value is to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone ATTRIBUTES value to a thing or circumstance, a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions as it were. If an individual attributes value to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular goal, desires a particular set of circumstances, how</i><br>
<i>&gt; can this valuation be subjected to the determination as right or</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong? Can it be evaluated as means to itself?</i><br>
<p>
May I paraphrase?<br>
<p>
"Any 'rational' goal is simply a rational means to some other, not necessarily<br>
justified goal.  Therefore, there are no 'inherently rational' goals.  All<br>
goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from<br>
value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."<br>
<p>
This logic is absolutely irrefutable.<br>
The problem is that it's wrong.<br>
If anyone ever figures out why, their name will live forever.<br>
Because the exact same logic applies here:<br>
<p>
"All effects are the result of causes, which are themselves effects.  All<br>
'real' things are the result of other real things, and reality cannot be<br>
derived except from reality.  The objective reality of any statement,<br>
therefore, is zero."<br>
<p>
As far as I can tell, in our Universe - which is a very unintuitive place -<br>
things seem to be set up so that derived qualities can appear from nowhere. <br>
Demonstrating that any X requires a previous X is not sufficient to<br>
demonstrate that X does not exist.<br>
<p>
Don't ask me why.  Don't give me elaborate logical refutations.  That's just<br>
the way things are.  That's how the Universe works.  Anybody who doesn't like<br>
it is as much in denial as Einstein refusing to believe in quantum physics<br>
because "God does not play dice with the Universe".<br>
<p>
I have now made the adjustment, and it now seems as reasonable that things<br>
appear from nowhere, as it does that there is no objective space of<br>
simultaneity, or that the chance of something happening is a complex number. <br>
I mean, why _shouldn't_ value appear from nowhere?  Huh?<br>
<p>
"I know of no law of logic demanding that every event have a cause."<br>
	- John K Clark<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All speak of the "moral good" etc. as "objective" and fixed. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires a constant and universal purpose. Thus one is obliged to</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandon individual as reference and rely on "God's will", or</i><br>
<i>&gt; other alleged source of a singular universal objective value.</i><br>
<p>
Ironically, that doesn't work either.  God created reality?  Who created God? <br>
God wants something?  What for?<br>
<p>
Many religions make deeply flawed assertions about God and objective morality.<br>
 The irony, of course, is that they can only be objectively false if we grant<br>
that objective morality exists.<br>
