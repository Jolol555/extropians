<i>&gt; I have not yet read the issue, but it sounds like Postrel has a point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Much of the opposition to progress and advancement comes from those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; fear change.  The Rifkins and other neo-Luddites seem to oppose every new</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology that comes along.  It is important to counter the view that</i><br>
<i>&gt; change is something to be feared.</i><br>
<p>
WHile nuts like rifkin &amp; company are irrational in their fear of change,<br>
most average people have developed, through the industrial revolution to<br>
today,  a sense that technological change is a threat to their ability<br>
to earn an income doing what they do now, a threat to their jobs.<br>
Remember, most people tend to be SOOO happy when they finish school and<br>
get out into the workforce. Most tend to get into the habit of thinking<br>
of learning something new as a pain in the butt. Just look at how union<br>
members look at new processes, new ways of working, etc. These guys and<br>
gals want to go to work, punch a clock and stop thinking for 8-12 hours,<br>
punch out, go home, and watch the tv, play with the kids, get drunk, and<br>
fornicate all night.<br>
<p>
Due to this, anything that will make them change their set ways of being<br>
is therefore a threat to their peace of mind, added stress in an already<br>
stressful world. Following a path of least stress is the easiest way for<br>
them to get through life.<br>
<p>
THis is why the computer revolution didn't really get going in the home<br>
market until graphical user interfaces were easy to use and affordable,<br>
why the internet didn't get really going until easy to use graphical<br>
WYSIWYG web interfaces became available.<br>
<p>
WHile people want to automate their personal lives as much as possible,<br>
they don't want to automate their workplaces so much that their jobs<br>
will go away.<br>
<p>
What is needed is:<br>
a) widespread PR of studies showing that technological progress<br>
INCREASES employment and earning power.<br>
b) further expansion of automation of products and processes in people's<br>
personal lives so that a generation down the road, the kids of today<br>
will be living by the credo that tech is cool (this is already starting<br>
to some extent here in the US). Personal life automation has been the<br>
last area to be automated by computers. Solve this need.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course you are right that not all change is good.  Once we get past</i><br>
<i>&gt; the view that change in itself is threatening, we can then stand on</i><br>
<i>&gt; common ground to evaluate various possible options.  Each of us will make</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own decisions about which changes and new technologies to embrace.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some may seem initially beneficial, like new designer drugs, or full-sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtual sex, but in the end may prove to be harmful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wrote earlier today about knee-jerk libertarianism.  Let us agree that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people are free to exploit whatever technologies they like in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; improve their lives.  When we speak of "talking about" changes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "engineering their flow" it is in the context of mutually voluntary</i><br>
<i>&gt; interactions, of persuasion and reason, not force and coercion.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; provides an unthreatening context to discuss the opportunities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangers which change presents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would support a form of "dynamism" which recognizes that change is</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitable, and that change is not to be opposed per se.  But at the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, within the dynamic context we still want to think carefully and</i><br>
<i>&gt; critically about the new possibilities available to us, their implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; and effects.</i><br>
