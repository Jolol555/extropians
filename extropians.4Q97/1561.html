This is my latest attempt to envision the future.<br>
A copy will live at <br>
<a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/future/nov97-scenario.html">http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/future/nov97-scenario.html</a><br>
<p>
<p>
1) The "assembler breakthrough".<br>
<p>
I recently posted to sci.nanotech that I expect the first<br>
assemblers within five years. I would now add to that, that<br>
I think most of the foreseeable uses of nanotech (that don't <br>
require astronomical quantities of matter) will be possible <br>
within two years of the fabrication of assemblers. My reasons:<br>
<p>
i) Once we have assemblers, we can build new designs very quickly -<br>
thus accelerating the construction stage in the design-and-test <br>
cycle.  Furthermore, those who are trying to design, say, a <br>
new type of nanosystem will be able to use the Internet of five <br>
years' time as a collaborative medium. I doubt that we can imagine<br>
very clearly just what possibilities will exist, but we have<br>
every reason to believe they will be awesome. Think of shared<br>
3D virtual design-spaces, and realtime webcrawling agents making<br>
spontaneous comments.<br>
<p>
ii) Once we have assemblers, new sorts of intracellular probes<br>
should be possible; our knowledge of cellular workings should<br>
quickly become just about complete. In particular, this will<br>
be true of neurons.<br>
<p>
One consequence: our ability to model biological systems will<br>
be improved, and therefore our ability to extrapolate the<br>
consequences of proposed interventions (e.g. therapies and<br>
augmentations). Even something with the complexity of the<br>
fabled "cell-repair machine" might become feasible very quickly.<br>
<p>
<p>
2) The noetics revolution.<br>
<p>
"Noetics" is my term for whatever is going to emerge from the<br>
current interest in "consciousness studies". I am skeptical<br>
that current cognitive models of consciousness are adequate,<br>
and that a description of the brain in which the finest grain<br>
is "neuron firing" or "neuron not firing" will *ever* do<br>
justice to the phenomenon. If the current interest in "quantum<br>
mind" theories fares any better, it would not surprise me if<br>
it does so in conjunction with new interpretations of quantum <br>
theory which impute more structure to the world than the local<br>
spatial relations which glue together the space-time manifold <br>
of pre-quantum physics. I imagine a mature theory of noetics<br>
to resemble a combination of the most abstract mathematics<br>
and philosophical phenomenology (with its odd analyses of<br>
the structure of conscious experience), grounded in a postquantum<br>
physics equipped with concepts like David Finkelstein's "qets"<br>
("quantum sets").<br>
<p>
If there is anything to these ideas, one should expect them<br>
to bear fruit very soon after the arrival of assemblers, if<br>
not before, since (as argued above) newly detailed knowledge<br>
of the brain and its neurons should definitely tell us<br>
whether there's quantum coherence happening in there, and<br>
equally, the burgeoning development of quantum technology<br>
(quantum computation, quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation)<br>
should help us sort through the various interpretations<br>
and postquantum theories.<br>
<p>
If the truth turns out to be not so far removed from what<br>
we already understand - i.e. information processing by<br>
locally deterministic physical systems - we can still expect<br>
that our theories of mind will have a new robustness and<br>
conviction, thanks to the new biological data.<br>
<p>
<p>
3) Mind acceleration.<br>
<p>
Fast minds whose subjective time passes at a thousand or a<br>
million times human speed are generally anticipated to be<br>
a consequence of mind uploading. As a skeptic regarding<br>
the completeness of functionalist theories of mind, I'm a<br>
skeptic regarding our current ideas of mind uploading.<br>
But this doesn't mean that such schemes can't work at all.<br>
Suppose (for example) that the "mind" - the "thing that<br>
is conscious" - consists of a set of quantum-entangled<br>
electrons, spread across millions of neurons which belong <br>
to a particular phenotype optimized for quantum coherence,<br>
and implementing some sort of quantum computer through<br>
their superposed spin-flips. I see no reason why you<br>
couldn't replace all the other neurons with nanocomputers,<br>
in traditional Moravecian fashion, and then accelerate<br>
the spin-flipping processes to the same degree, through<br>
more fine-grained interventions at the quantum-chemical<br>
level. This would be an incredible achievement by<br>
contemporary standards, but it's not inconceivable.<br>
<p>
So even if mind uploading doesn't work, mind acceleration<br>
will still be a thinkable goal. I therefore predict that<br>
that a "mind-acceleration underground" will emerge after<br>
the assembler revolution, availing itself of the new<br>
technology - and in all likelihood it *will* be an <br>
underground. If governments ban psychedelics and human<br>
cloning, what will they think of a technology meant to <br>
accelerate mental processes by orders of magnitude?<br>
<p>
I do have to mention what seems to me the main competition<br>
in the race towards fast minds, and that is the "de novo"<br>
fast mind - nonhuman, and produced by design and/or <br>
evolutionary engineering. Again, even if I'm right that<br>
consciousness is not just neural information-processing,<br>
there's no reason why artificial consciousness can't be<br>
created in artificial systems with the right characteristics.<br>
It may well be easier to start from scratch, than to<br>
transform the human brain piecemeal into a faster medium.<br>
<p>
One more comment. For those who always use as their mental<br>
medium the fastest available, there may never be any<br>
Singularity. Superintelligences - "Powers" - will be extremely<br>
complex entities. Even if we had "wish machines" which could<br>
grant any wish that was formulated with sufficient exactness,<br>
I think we'd have trouble getting them to produce a<br>
superintelligence, since our notions are not developed<br>
enough to frame the wish precisely. If this is true, then<br>
genuine intelligence increase (as opposed to simple<br>
increase of basic speed) will be a slow affair, in the<br>
subjective time of the entities at work on the problem.<br>
The Singularity, according to this conception, will only<br>
ever happen to those entities which miss out on mind<br>
acceleration, and who consequently experience the changes<br>
in subjectively brief time.<br>
<p>
<p>
4) Picotechnology and space-time engineering<br>
<p>
The possibility of "picotechnology" (technology on nuclear<br>
and smaller scales) is sometimes rejected on the grounds<br>
that, at least outside a neutron star, all you can do with<br>
nucleons is to make the existing spectrum of nuclei. But I<br>
don't think we can safely assume that if anything else<br>
is possible, we'll have to go to space to obtain the<br>
necessary conditions. Look at recent speculations on<br>
"Q-balls", the hypothesized supersymmetric counterparts<br>
to nucleons. Unlike quarks, "superquarks" are spin-zero<br>
bosons and can form arbitrarily large aggregates. The Q-ball<br>
theorists suggest that "the laws of physics" would be<br>
different in their interior; more specifically, that<br>
particle masses, lifetimes and interactions would be<br>
different there. Or consider Bose-Einstein condensation.<br>
Here is a way to get atoms to pile up on top of each other.<br>
Could one use this to obtain densities approaching those<br>
of exotic states of matter like neutronium? Finally,<br>
consider that theorists of the inflationary universe<br>
(Alan Guth and Andrei Linde) have said that in principle<br>
one would need only a few kilograms of mass-energy to<br>
create a "basement universe". (No doubt they would argue<br>
that one would need a lot more, in order to concentrate<br>
those kilograms of mass-energy appropriately. I can't<br>
help but wonder whether the necessary apparatus really<br>
could fit in a basement.)<br>
<p>
There are any number of reasons for a fast-mind society<br>
to explore such possibilities. One might hope to gain<br>
space, energy, or computation from endlessly propagating<br>
chains or networks of space-time bubbles, modelled<br>
on the cosmology of self-reproducing universes that<br>
has obtained attention recently. One might hope to<br>
accelerate oneself to even greater speeds, perhaps as<br>
far as one unit of "Planck time" per tick of the <br>
subjective clock (that would be a clock speed of about <br>
10^43 Hz). One might hope to make wormholes, link up<br>
"known space" with them, and send them out into the<br>
universe (or into newly fashioned universes) as<br>
probes.<br>
<p>
A notion that intrigues me: as subjective time speeds up,<br>
subjective space expands. For a mind that is faster by<br>
a factor of a thousand, Earth is a thousand times bigger,<br>
in that it takes a thousand times longer to circumnavigate.<br>
There might well be a practical argument for the creation<br>
of wormholes here - to prevent the disintegration of<br>
the network of accelerated minds from "subjective expansion".<br>
<p>
Another option which may be significant in an era of<br>
space-time engineering is out-and-out Separation:<br>
migration into a designer universe, followed by the<br>
severing of all ties with the parent universe.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. "Post-spatial" existence<br>
<p>
What are the limits? String theory and its successor<br>
M theory already describe conditions under which the effective<br>
dimensionality of spacetime changes, along with the inventory <br>
of fields and their interactions. Can we go further and<br>
imagine "realms" which are not spaces at all? Think of the<br>
variety of form possible amongst sets, or data structures.<br>
What sort of structure could we choose to give to the world<br>
we inhabit - or to the "phenomenal world" which we perceive?<br>
<p>
Let me make more concrete the thinking behind this idea.<br>
What if it were the case that spatial adjacency and<br>
quantum entanglement were two instances of the same sort<br>
of thing, namely an ultimate elementary relation of<br>
"connectedness"? One might fashion something resembling a<br>
wormhole by engineering an appropriate entanglement of<br>
two physical systems; I gather that such a setup is a <br>
necessary precursor of quantum teleportation.<br>
<p>
Once one starts thinking of the physical world as a sort <br>
of web of connected space-time points, it's a short step<br>
to imagining webs without the gridlike structure of<br>
space. But I don't know how to take this idea further<br>
at present.<br>
