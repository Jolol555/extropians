&lt;&lt; &gt;What's a linear motor?<br>
 <br>
Imagine taking the coil around a regular electric motor and laying<br>
it out flat. Instead of the motor making something go around, it<br>
could go left to right, you could lay it out like a train track and<br>
a magnetized train could move along it suspended and driven by the<br>
opposing magnetic fields. This is known a a "Maglev". (for<br>
magnetic/levitation) and was originally developed at M.I.T. in the<br>
early sixties.<br>

<i>&gt; There it is in front of your eyes!</i><br>
<p>
I first noticed the South America/Africa fit when I was in grammar<br>
school, and you are correct, the two were originally touching, in<br>
fact all land was a single mass, we have named it Pangea. You are<br>
incorrect in that there is only one way for this to be achieved.<br>
(expansion of the earths circumference.)<br>
<p>
<p>
South America/Africa are on two different plates (plate tectonics)<br>
the area between them is known a a fault. The fault between these<br>
two is in the bottom of the Atlantic now, it is known as the Mid-<br>
Atlantic ridge, and is volcanically active. We know it is there<br>
because of a variety of oceanographic data, and minisubs have have<br>
visited and photographed it.<br>
<p>
Magma from the Earths core rises at this point pushing the opposing<br>
plates apart. You might be interested in how this was confirmed. As<br>
the rising magma cools the iron particles in it align themselves<br>
with the earths magnetic field, and are trapped in that orientation<br>
when it solidifies. As you know the Earths magnetic field reverses<br>
from time to time (10s of thousands of years) so the orientation of<br>
the particles changes. This creates bands of particles over time.<br>
<p>
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-       -+-+-+-+-+-+-+<br>
        South America |||||||||||||| ridge |||||||||||||| Africa<br>
                      -+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-<br>
 <br>
When the magnetic bands in the sea floor were checked, they formed<br>
mirror images on either side of the Mid-Atlantic ridge!<br>
<p>
When two plates collide they can raise up (forming mountains) or<br>
one is pushed below the other (subduction). The area off Japan is<br>
a huge subduction zone leading to frequent earthquakes (seismometer<br>
needles in Japan are always moving) and increased volcanic activity<br>
as the subducted plate, now headed for the earths core, melts.<br>
<p>
Check your local PBS station for a series called "Planet Earth",<br>
they do a much better job of explaining it than I do.  ;)<br>
