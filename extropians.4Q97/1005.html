The Borg and Dominion of Star Trek, and First Ones of Babylon-5, are<br>
transhuman (well, trans-original-organic-alien.)  They have gone beyond<br>
there previous states through technological means.  Are they extropian?<br>
<p>
The Borg are definitely big on Boundless Expansion (so's cancer.  So's a<br>
black hole).  If we ignore the "Borg Queen" stuff they may operate on<br>
Spontaneous Order, like our brains.  Dynamic Optimism, check.<br>
Intelligent Technology, check.  Self Transformation, check.<br>
<p>
Oops, checked the text of the Principles.  Don't know if "voluntaristic"<br>
and "diversity" apply even within the Borg.<br>
<p>
The Founders of the Dominion have evolved themselves into immortal<br>
shapeshifters who don't always seem to worry about the First Law of<br>
Thermodynamics.  ST check and mate.  SO?  The Great Link qualifies.<br>
They're pretty tolerant among themselves, and if you want to apply<br>
diversity to shapeshifters...  They're not so hot on spontaneity<br>
anywhere else, mostly because they've usually been persecuted by anyone<br>
who could get away with it.  IT?  They use intelligent races as tools.<br>
They don't need much themselves these days, except to move around.<br>
BE?  They've overcome most limits already.<br>
<p>
I think most would agree that the Borg aren't extropian, but SO is the<br>
only missing principle.  They're really neat otherwise.  And the<br>
Dominion is even neater -- the only non-extropian thing on them is their<br>
effort to bring all Solids into the Dominion.  Which they see as a<br>
self-defense measure.  And not that pre-emptive, either.<br>
<p>
Is being mean to wild intelligences far below you on the tech scale<br>
non-extropian, if you're libertarian among yourselves?  A big question<br>
when AI comes around, and I don't remember a consensus on the list.<br>
Except the AIs aren't wild, but possibly tame or domesticated<br>
intelligences.<br>
<p>
} Extropianism is transhumanism plus the claim that the Extropian <br>
} Principles (by Max More) are right. Thus you can't be an extropian <br>
<p>
I still like my rendition: extropianism is the Enlightenment, updated.<br>
Adam Smith, Darwin, computers, the success of Anglo-American societies<br>
over benevolent dictatorships.<br>
<p>
Transhumanism is Renaissance humanism with more toys and broader<br>
horizons.<br>
<p>
The Enlightenment was humanist.  Was their non-Englightened humanism?<br>
Uh, I'll pass to Max.<br>

"I think it's amazing that 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult thought<br>
they would beam up to space ships if they killed themselves.  Any<br>
reasonable person knows that in reality they will be reincarnated as<br>
animals.  You might not agree with my belief in reincarnation, but a lot<br>
of people do, so it's not a cult.  There's certainly no evidence that<br>
larger groups of people have ever believed anything stupid.  So once the<br>
number of believers exceeds a certain level, say 40, you have to think<br>
there's something to it.<br>
<p>
Unlike those "cultists" I wasn't brainwashed into my beliefs.  I simply<br>
had a huge painful void in my life that I filled with the first thing<br>
that came along.  You have to respect that. I'm not as gullible as those<br>
poor saps.  That's probably because I was born in June, which makes me<br>
a Gemini.  We're naturally skeptical." -- Scott Adams<br>
