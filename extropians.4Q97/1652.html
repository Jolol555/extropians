<i>&gt;&gt;The new wave</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;© by Danilo D'Antonio</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We are people that, not satisfied of the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;evolutional level reached by us ourselves, from our knowledges and from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society, we endeavour to search to constantly reach a superior one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Unsatisfied of the usual, old and barren roads allowed by the even older</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;institutions, we engage ourselves to open some new ones and to conceive wide</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and clear processes of renewal. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We comprehend perfectly to be only a modest expression</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of our natural and social environment. For this reason we take care of it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and we attend it personally. Improving things around us, we find automaticly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;improved the things inside of us. At the same time we unequivocally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;recognize that the value of a society is given by the sum of values of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;single fellows. For this reason we intervene at first on ourselves:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;improving ourselves we will see improved also surrounding environment. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We are perfectly conscious that each single part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reality, even our very person, it can be well comprehended and managed only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;if considered inside the whole organism that contains it: social, natural,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;forgeting not at all that cosmic, universal. For this reason we cultivate a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;global, olistic approach of knowledge and action. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. Also recognizing the importance and the utility to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;delegate at others specific tasks, also recognizing necessary the presence</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of the specialists in society, of people that occupy exclusively of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sector, we are able to see also the limits of this organizational system</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;when it becomes social foundation. Being not predisposed, in fact, to gather</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a global, wide vision of reality, it produces disordered, dishomogeneous,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;irrational actions and opposite between them. Also maintaining the maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;respect for specialists and continuing to apply them where it was tightly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;necessary, we personally endeavour to develop inside ourselves manifold</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;capacities, both in intellectual field and material. We search to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;contemporarily be farmers and people of government, physicians and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;architects, electricians and educators, gymnasts and philosophers. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Long from retaining these figures incompatibles between them, we see</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;identical universal laws to be at the base of each knowledge, of each</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;disciplines, of each job, capacity and attitude. We see our faculties</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;developed in a field immediately procuring us steps forward also in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;others fields. We verify daily like a discovery, an idea had during a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defined activity is functional also to the others. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Nevertheless we research, too, if we desire it, a field in which our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;expressive level become highest, but never, never we omit to cultivate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;global consciousness and attitudes. Well we know that if specialization can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be made correspond to height, the global vision, for its width, concerns</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with the base of the expressive construction, and we know also that no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;height can be maintained at long without an adequate base. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We have a direct and costant contact with nature that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is for us a continuous source of inspiration, suggestions and help. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;from nature that, for example, we learn just the important principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;rotation: never no farmer would dream to dedicate the same ground always to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the same cultivation, because on the best of the hypotesis it would produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;corrupt and poisonous fruits. And on Planet Earth wouldn't have traces of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;life if it didn't rotate on itself daily, originating the day and the night.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In the same way we introduce the principle of rotation in our life and in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society. We abhor devoting ourselves always to the same activity and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;range in innumerable fields of intervention. We alternate ourselves with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;liked and intimate interest in the different social rôles, the rotation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;being a fundamental rigenerating, advantageous and productive principle,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;because the replacement of energies put in movement. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We live inside a wide temporal perspective. We know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;well that the best results are obtained acting with broad advance, so we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;learn, yes, from the past, but we don't remain at all tied there, we root</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ourselves in the present, instant by instant, to obtain the greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;efficacy from our actions, and we build future making good use of creativity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and imagination. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We avoid to apply to human law and therefore to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;menace and to the violence of stratagems and weapons of who defends it. For</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;us applying at laws, codes and machine-guns is something greatly immoral and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;declaring our inability to manage life. Instead, basing ourselves on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;nature's laws and conceiving adequate and wide, honest and manifest,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;positive and kind strategies of intervention and elevating our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;auto-responsability's sense at a level of art, we obtain the maximum result</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by each our action, in perfect freedom of everyone's expression. This one at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;all levels and in all ambits of society. Nevertheless we follow the rules of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society in which we live, but we act serenely, quietly, constantly to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;improve them. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We put our attention and give great relief to the rôle</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of education. We know well that the better way to drive a family, a group, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society, is that to show wonderful goals and desired prizes as well as to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;supply shining and brilliant examples, not punish people that environment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;has rendered devoid of a valid aim. We know well the phisical principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the resonance of energies and we apply it also in social biology: this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;why we first accomplish what we desire be accomplished. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We attribute a determinant, fundamental rôle to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;auto-didactics. We are in fact well conscious of the primary rôle that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;strong inner, personnel desire has inside the process of learning, and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;similarly are conscious of limits of an outer bestowed education. A school</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defined "of the obligation", based exclusively on duty, is for us a horrible</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;oath and we choose instead the school of the good will and of the pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;furnished from study, from engagement, from search and at last from the</i><br>
result. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We cultivate our mental presence always and everywhere,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;well conscious of the fact that the most precious thing for a living being</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is his consciousness: devoid of it we find ourselves as simple robots</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;piloted by doom. Great sensitiveness, therefore, not disjoint however from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;force of heart to accomplish what sometimes isn't pleasant but has to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;however accomplished. We cultivate, however, all the Soul Powers, all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;human hearth qualities, not leaving out no one, indeed reserching it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;finding it and creating new of them. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We have a continue awareness of the infinite character</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of reality: in this way we discover a great abundance of shades and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;therefore of opportunities. Where a conventional mind, the old wave become</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by now simple foam, it wouldn't be able to perceive no ways out of it, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;new wave, formed an alliance with time, finds myriads of solutions and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;applies them with success. For this reason we try immediately a great social</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;involving, as with in mind an effective solution, tested first of all on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ourselves, in our private life, we are unable to resist from putting not it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in practice also around us. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We are protagonist actors, not simple spectators. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;don't only inform ourselves, but we contrive to become able to manage, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;realize. We are primary evolution agents. We have the courage to dream at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;open eyes and to work for a long time to realize what we dream. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We assume full responsibility for everything that happens us. Far from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;attributing faults and responsibility at others or at outer facts, far from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;asking to the others what in our hearth we desire, far from losing precious</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;energies in moans and protests, we mind to manage personally our things,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;searching efficacy in our actions. Also conscious of the good opportunities</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;inborn in an organization but even more conscious of dangers that accompany</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the rise of great groups, we search the most possible to remain within</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;simple and light, flexible and changeable structures, on manner to face</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;efficaciously the various realities that come little by little presenting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;On such a way we always remain orientated towards the pre-established and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;declared in departure aims, of sure not indulgeing into corporative</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;interests. We realize the refinement and potentiament process in act on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Planet Earth and we provide refining and potentiating also our instruments</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and those ones of the whole society. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We manage our reproductive and sexual sphere on full</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consciousness of the large field of energies put in movement from it. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;allow ourselves to the reproduction only after to have reached an elevated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;degree of global development, only after and never before to have progressed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in decisive way in each field: moral, cultural, social, economic. We are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;perfectly conscious that otherwise the weight of a progeny would be for us</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;too much great to take, with the consequence to impede a sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;development to ourselves, at first, and to our progeny, to continue, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the whole mankind, for extension. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Just not taking care of this, mankind has been able to reach a more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;considerable quantity level, a high number of fellows, succeeding today in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;being formed with about six billions of fellows. But it is also so that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;meanwhile it has obliged itself to remain at a qualitative level of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;individual capacities rather low that obliges it still in thousand of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sufferings for wars, hunger and poverty. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Become aware, instead, after to have studied ancient and new texts and after</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to have rendered the sexual act also a personal experiment of scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;observation, besides source of powerful and pleasant energies, we catch</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;these last and we keep them in ourselves to be able disposing of them also</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;during more productive processes of development. In such a way we favour a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;firm step forward toward the coming of a new age characterized from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;prosperity and a welfare without equals, globally wide. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We don't disperse or dissipate our economic energies,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but we do a wise use of them, avoiding so to fall in the trap of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consumptions to the bitter end. These in fact oblige at a blind, incessant</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;work, at a continuous vain search of reintegration of own resources,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;absorbing so all personal energies, a good part of them should be instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;utilized to feed the own process of growth, the own evolution. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We avoid, then, to apply at an economy become by now purely cannibal, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;which the hunt to the other, to the customer, to the human being is always</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;open, in which everyone feeds reciprocally of the energies of the neighbour,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;without never reflecting if what he offers in change has a real, authentic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;healthy value. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We engage ourselves instead to conceive, to create, to choose and to supply,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;matter, concrete or ideal, that be good feed for the human beings, that be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;an help to improve deeply, radically the surrounding reality. We engage</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ourselves likewise to research and employ new economic patterns that haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;got money to the centre of their attention and like last end, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;creation of instruments always new and perfected that render more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;able and powerful, wise and lightened, beautiful and harmonious the human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;beings. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We engage ourselves to bring back to the highest point a solar economy, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;which everyone interrogates himself on what we really need and in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;direction is well turning, an economy in which the forces and the resources</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of nature be elaborated in manner to let a general, diffuse bloom, of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;single as of society, of mankind as of natural environment. An economy that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have full consciousness of the rôle that we are called to hold, from always</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and for always, inside of the universal organism and that, for this, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;able to effect the better choices. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We research and listen each person, each master that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;can making us advancing on the infinite roads of knowledge, of welfare and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of prosperity, but never we tie ourselves at no one, because we realize well</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that even the best and more prepared human being won't be able never to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;contain in himself the boundless extent of reality. Indeed, realized the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;continuous changeability in the long run of this last, we go over the limits</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reached by masters, prosecuting resolute the researches started from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We haven't dread but, indeed, we try the intimate duty to correct,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;contradicting and postponing, where necessary, who has preceded us. We all,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;learnings and professors, being tied by an indissoluble tie: to have alwais</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;an entire universe of things to comprehend. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Also if at times we delegate at others, who have reached a superior level of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;universal sensitivenes, the management of religious rites, never we renounce</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to accomplish personal ones and never we interrupt our search and growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;also in this field. Never stopped by the inevitable obstacles, never still</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on reached laurels, we continue to research and grow slowly, quietly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;pleasantly, until the last breath. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are the new wave. We have awareness of ourselves not only like material,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;physical beings, but also like pure, changeable and incontainable energy. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are people without limits, without frontiers. We don't identify ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;only in a human being but we know acquiring, to the need, also the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sensitiveness of every other living form, of an animal, of a flower, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;also that one of a river, of a mount either even of an atom or of the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;universe. We know becoming and transforming ourselves in the whole and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;disappearing all of a sudden in the nothing. We know that our human shape is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;only exquisitely temporary and we consider our parents as simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ramifications of a tree that sinks its roots on earth and stretches its</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;leaves in the Cosmos: Earth and Cosmos are our real and felt parents. And</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;then we cultivate in us love, comprehension, compassion, joy and at last the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;identification for all the others shapes of existence. And so we become</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eternal, defeating at last the death! </i><br>
