<i>&gt;-- Per capita growth rates between nations have been highly divergent; </i><br>

<i>&gt;are about as low (in per capital income) as all nations were once.  </i><br>
<p>
 How has the difference between the highest nations and the median<br>
been changing? This seems more important for determining the risk that<br>
we will be conquered by some other region that makes a major technological<br>
breakthrough.<br>
 My impression is that within areas that can afford to stay reasonably<br>
up to date with most communication and transportation technologies,<br>
that there should be a convergence of growth rates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- Britain took off initially most likely due to strong social </i><br>
<i>&gt;controls on birth rates, free markets, and a strong culture of </i><br>
<i>&gt;hobby science.  Even then the takeoff was very slow.</i><br>
<p>
 How could birth rate control contribute to growth?<br>
<p>
 On a loosely related note, I recommend Crosby's book The Measure<br>
of Reality, which describes how European culture changed from an<br>
almost purely qualitative view of the world in 1250 to a fairly<br>
quantitative view in 1600, setting the stage for explosions of<br>
technology and businesses.<br>
