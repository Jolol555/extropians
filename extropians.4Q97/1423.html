Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,<br>
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst<br>
for a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment<br>
their intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their<br>
communities. The Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through<br>
a creative process of networking and an educational process of<br>
disseminating ideas.<br>
<p>
In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and<br>
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of<br>
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new<br>
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.<br>
Seeking to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span,<br>
augmenting human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining<br>
economic and political organization, Extropy Institute provides several<br>
forums for networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter<br>
gathers news of developments, members’ projects, and Institute activities.<br>
The EXTRO conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of<br>
study. Other seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and<br>
the web site provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.<br>
<p>
In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and<br>
evolving) extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational<br>
practices and beliefs. The Institute’s web site provides information on<br>
extropian thinking and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents<br>
extropian thinking gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to<br>
intelligent non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their<br>
networking role, also act as a means of communicating current extropian<br>
thinking to the public. The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the<br>
public through appearances of its members on television and in newspapers,<br>
magazines, and books, and by representing extropian perspectives at<br>
conferences and in debates.<br>
<p>
In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that<br>
extend our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While<br>
Institute members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about<br>
how to pursue these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the<br>
Extropian Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation,<br>
Self-Ownership, Dynamic Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous<br>
Order. [see www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]<br>
<p>
<p>
E X T R O P I A N S  O N  T H E  N E T<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute sponsors a number of forums for sharing limit-busting,<br>
life-extensionist, pro-technology, and other extropian ideas with bright,<br>
like-minded individuals around the globe.<br>
<p>
You can also access the Frequently Asked Questions file, and other<br>
Extropian writings, on the World Wide Web. The official ExI Web page:<br>

anti-aging drugs.<br>

and cognitive techniques.<br>
*    How to modify your mood and motivation with new drugs, and cognitive<br>
management.<br>
*    Where does traditional thinking about radical technologies go wrong?<br>
*    How can we refine our political and social organization? How can<br>
spontaneous order enable us to handle accelerating change?<br>
*    Rethinking traditional moralities in the face of scientific and<br>
technological breakthroughs.<br>
*    Plus: Nanotechnology and molecular computers; artificial wombs and new<br>
methods of parenting; transhumanist philosophy to make sense of rapid<br>
change; prosexual drugs and nutrients; critical thinking about<br>
environmental and resource issues; electronic money and competing<br>
currencies; machine intelligence and artificial life; experimental<br>

technological frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle, and stimulate you. <br>

    "I love it. Extropy excites the hell out of my mind." ZL, 1/93<br>
 <br>
    "In general I would call it the best periodical I have ever seen in my<br>
life..." AC, 8/92<br>
 <br>
    "I just wanted to let you know that Extropy keeps getting better &amp;<br>
better! (as, of course, it must in order to be so named). What a uniformly<br>
excellent, eclectic, thoughtful, well-written selection of articles. By far<br>
the most thought-provoking, ground-breaking stuff in any magazine I read."<br>

Our successful third conference, EXTRO-3, took place in San Jose,<br>
California in August 1997, with Dr. Eric Drexler of the Institute for<br>
Molecular Manufacturing as keynote speaker. 165 attendees a range of<br>
stimulating sessions and talked with some of the leading extropic thinkers<br>
of today. Audio and videotapes of all the sessions are available (at a<br>
discount for Institute members).<br>
<p>
EXTRO-4, focusing on extension of the maximum human life span (both the<br>
research being done, what measures can be taken today, and the economic and<br>
psychological consequences), is being planned for August 1998, either in<br>
California or Las Vegas. Members will receive updates, which will also<br>
appear on the web site.<br>
