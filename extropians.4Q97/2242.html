<i>&gt; From:          "John Dickson" &lt;johnd@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The important thing that no one is addressing</i><br>
<p>
I'll disagree with this.  In my opinion there are a pair of reasons <br>
that the investigation into alternatives is not more apparent:<br>
<p>
(1) The problem is not pressing at present.<br>
<p>
(2) It seems the most critical question regarding any possible new <br>
energy source is not how well it works, but how efficiently it can be <br>
taxed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fossil fuels we are burning represent the end result of millions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of years of solar energy concentrated into these highly energetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; substances.  I don't think anyone will argue that we are burning</i><br>
<i>&gt; this stuff at an extremely accelerated rate,</i><br>
<p>
I won't argue with that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and the fact is, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are gone, that is it.</i><br>
<p>
Probability near zero.  We HAVE, today, a passable SUBSTITUTE for <br>
gasoline that can be made by relatively low-tech, low-energy means, <br>
strictly from an extremely renewable resource -- agricultural <br>
wastes.  (It's ethanol.  Not gasohol -- just ethanol.  About 180 <br>
proof.  We know how to make solar-powered distillers that deliver <br>
this purity, out of ordinary construction materials. Your carburetor <br>
must be adjusted because you'll consume about twice as much of the <br>
stuff per mile as you do gasoline.)  We also have a number of <br>
non-fossil sources of oils.  The hypothesis that we cannot come up <br>
with satisfactory artificial petrochemicals is untenable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I happen to believe they might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; important, and I would rather not run out of them any time soon. </i><br>
<p>
That, I can agree with.  What we most desperately need to avoid is an <br>
artificially maintained low price when the supply situation calls for <br>
a price increase -- it is precisely this price increase that will <br>
inspire the work on developing and deploying alternatives, so that we <br>
don't hit a crisis.<br>
<p>
So if we can arrange for governments to NOT formulate energy policies <br>
and NOT act to protect people from rising energy costs, we don't have <br>
a problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not so much about the atmosphere, but rather how limited a</i><br>
<i>&gt; resource they represent.  I think fossil fuels have better uses than</i><br>
<i>&gt; being inefficiently combusted when I commute to work.</i><br>
<p>
I won't argue with this one either.<br>
