Extract from a discussion I had elsewhere. While a lot of this is<br>
tongue-in-cheek the concepts are a possibility for the future:<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what do you think is acceptable punishment?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that at the birth of the firstborn child in each household</i><br>
a<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; special "punishment device" should be issued to the parents. This</i><br>
is to<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; be the ONLY acceptable method of punishment, and prosecution will</i><br>
NOT be<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed for ANY use of the device by a parent to their child. I am</i><br>
not<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; sure exactly what it would be, but the electric shock idea is</i><br>
probably<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the best. The requirements for the device/system are:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Different levels of punishment, selectable by the parent, with</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; maximum set at some non-lethal level by medical practitioners.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Device must be portable/easily administered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hmmm... how about a taser, so the parents don't have to leave their</i><br>
chair?<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Using the device for any other purpose than parent-&gt; &gt;child</i><br>
discipline<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; is an offense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Except between two consenting adults.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. There might possibly need to be a limit set in the device, such</i><br>
as a<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; maximum power output per day.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe a chip embedded under the childs skin would be the best</i><br>
idea, and<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; could be activated by remote control by the parent. Eventually</i><br>
parents<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; will simply have to think and their child will experience pain, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually simulated emotions such as regret/remorse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus punishment could be totally standardised across the country,</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the laws would be absolute.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your proposal doesn't take into account the fact that every child is</i><br>
different. Some<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a higher tolerance of pain than others. While the punishment</i><br>
administered would<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be identical, the punishment "received" would be different for each</i><br>
child.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That would be at the discretion of the parents I guess, although I</i><br>
don't<br>
<i>&gt; like the element of ambiguity that introduces. Maybe by the time the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole country debates this proposal and a referendum is held medical</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology which can measure pain thresholds will have developed.</i><br>
<p>
Now it's getting too complicated for the average parent. What we need is<br>
"punishment processing factories" where children are given punishment by<br>
trained professionals.<br>
<p>
These factories could also act as a societal syphon for all the saddists<br>
out there. I think murder and rape rates would drop substantially if<br>
such people could vent their anger on small children.<br>
