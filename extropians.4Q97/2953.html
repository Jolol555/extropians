      Hello!<br>
<p>
      Some thoughts on the 'violence' issue, prompted by the thoughful <br>
      contributions of Anders Sandberg and Kathryn Aegis.<br>
<p>
      Swiss psychotherapist Alice Miller's horrifying book on the subject <br>
      of 'poisonous pedagogy' -- "'For Your Own Good':  The Roots of <br>
      Violence in Child-Rearing" (Virago, [1987] -- is an inclusive and <br>
      comprehensive descriptive and explanatory account, which answers the <br>
      basic question: "How would you have to bring up a child, for him or <br>
      her to be a violent adult?"<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      When I lived and worked at the Alternative Bookshop in Covent <br>
      Garden, Central London, I used to go for (unarmed!) walks after <br>
      midnight arond Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and other <br>
      night-life venues.<br>
<p>
      With experience, it often became possible to see attackers and <br>
      'attackees' seeking each other out, and pairing off.  Many of the <br>
      'attackees' seemd to give off 'attack me!' signals ('Kick me!' <br>
      signals, in Eric Berne's (albeit flawed) Transactional Analysis <br>
      theory. Clearly, learning to spot 'aggressor' signals and <br>
      suppressing 'victim' flags would be most worthwhile.<br>
<p>
<p>
      I (used to) cultivate 'invisibility' (there's a whole literature on <br>
      how to do this in the world of spookdom -- field operatives often go <br>
      unremarked, as grey, unnoticeable people).  After doing Werner <br>
      Erhard's -- albeit flawed -- 'est' training in 1979, I had access to <br>
      a further intellectual arsenal of self-defence and self-projective <br>
      techniques.<br>
<p>
      I never did much martial arts training, because under UK law, using <br>
      martial arts skills against someone counts as 'assault with a deadly <br>
      weapon', and there are many deadlier weapons around.  I have a <br>
      preference for 'action-at-a-distance' anyway.  &gt;:-} In retrospect, I <br>
      may also have felt that I would be more aggressive (maybe just a tad <br>
      more self-assertive, anyway!) if I had greater martial arts skills. <br>
      And I _really don't like hurting people_.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      In my motorcycling days, I had a friend (Dave Watson) who was an <br>
      accomplished street-fighter (he took out three 'bouncers' in twenty <br>
      seconds in one incident).  He gave me some lessons.  Yet he ended up <br>
      in the 'fastest gun' trap, with thugs looking to make a reputation <br>
      who came looking for him.  Not much 'deterrent effect' there.<br>
<p>
      Another friend (Tony Owen) had his girl-friend harrassed in a <br>
      coffee-bar by three goons. He was too 'puny' to defend her, so he <br>
      just walked out (whereupon the harrassment stopped, AFAICR).  Half <br>
      an hour later, the goons exited the coffee-bar.  A large black car <br>
      was parked outside...<br>
<p>
<p>
      As the goons walked up the road, a voice called out:<br>
<p>
<p>
      "Turn around.  I'm not going to shoot you in the back."<br>
<p>
<p>
      There was Tony Owen, holding a single-action .45 revolver on them.<br>
<p>
<p>
      He pulled back the hammer, and &gt;click&lt;.  Misfire...<br>
<p>
      The three goons started towards him.  He calmly pulled back the <br>
      hammer again, and shot the first goon in the face.  The two <br>
      remaining goons stopped.  Tony Owen pulled back the hammer agiain, <br>
      and the next goon dropped, clutching his shoulder.  The third goon <br>
      sank to his knees, and started begging not to be shot.  Tony Owen <br>
      shot him anyway, got back into his big black car, and drove off to <br>
      Johnson's 'Rising Sun' motorcycle cafe.  He turned himself in to the <br>
      police an hour or two later, and was later sentenced to nine months' <br>
      imprisonment for all this.  (No-one had died: and it was pointed out <br>
      at his trial that his mother had been a victim of domestic violence <br>
      during his childhood).  People rather avoided him when he came out <br>
      of jail...<br>
<p>
<p>
      Many historians have suggested that the origin of English good <br>
      manners originated in the practice of duelling.  The same may be <br>
      true for America.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      One of my favourite books is "Civilian Resistance as a National <br>
      Defence"  with a chapter by Gene Sharpe, and another by April Carter <br>
      (a relative of mine).  I agree, that non-violence is prudent _and_ <br>
      effective, as well morally acceptable.  It _is_ the best policy, up <br>
      to a certain point.  Social innovation could further enhance its <br>
      effectiveness.  Ferinstance:<br>
<p>
      If each of us is equipped with uniquely-coded radio 'panic alarms', <br>
      (SARA beacons) so that we can personally summon assistance to our <br>
      exact location from our chosen service provider, we would see a <br>
      transformation of policing from a useless state-provided <br>
      social-control system into a customer-driven _personal protection <br>
      service_.  Crime would be vastly reduced.  Evil-doers would be <br>
      massively deterred by fast response times; and harm would be <br>
      reduced.  It would become less necessary to carry self-defence <br>
      weapons.<br>
<p>
      An illustration:  I am a formal external adviser to the Boulder, <br>
      Colorado District Attorney's Office (and to the Denver, Colorado <br>
      office of the FBI) in the investigation into the homicide of <br>
      JonBenet Ramsey a year ago (winner of many child beauty pageants, <br>
      JonBenet was just six years old).<br>
<p>
      It is my hypothesis that the slaying of Jonbenet Ramsey was a <br>
      deliberate act of terrorism, planned and carried through by <br>
      authoritarians with close connections to 'the authorities'; and that <br>
      the slaying was aimed at the child beauty-pageants' participating <br>
      parents and their children.  The repressed authoritarian mindset <br>
      hates the sight of liberated, free-spirited children (it reminds <br>
      them of the child they once were, who was destroyed by authoritarian <br>
      parenting).<br>
<p>
      Very recent press reports state that a police-type 'Taser' <br>
      electroshock gun was finally used to torture and kill JonBenet after <br>
      she had been systematically sexually tortured for many hours in the <br>
      basement of her parents' house.<br>
<p>
      If JonBenet had been wearing a 'SARA' alarm, she could have <br>
      instantly summoned help.  She might well be alive today.<br>
<p>
      Three guesses why 'the authorities' aren't too keen on this idea...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      There are five political dispositions in Britain and America:<br>
<p>
<p>
      disposition:    US   UK<br>
      ============    ==   ==<br>
<p>
      conservative:  35%  36%<br>
<p>
      libertarian:   20%  19%<br>
<p>
      socialist:     13%  18%<br>
<p>
      authoritarian: 20%  13%<br>
<p>
      centrist:      12%  15%<br>
<p>
     <br>
      The authoritarians were intellectually and emotionally and <br>
      spiritually crippled in childhood.  In 'adult' life they are hostile <br>
      to (and even attack) those who remind them of the free, capable, <br>
      spontaneous child they could have been (and in some cases perhaps <br>
      even once were).  They now abuse and oppress their own kids, <br>
      replicating their fell type.  They can be found in State employment, <br>
      'law enforcement', corporate hierarchies and blue-collar jobs.<br>
<p>
      How to deal with authoritarians will be the 21st Century's greatest <br>
      problem.  They killed over 100 million people in this century alone, <br>
      and 'soul-murdered' countless millions more.<br>
<p>
      Understand this: they'll destroy us if we permit it.<br>
<p>
      Three times this Century, Atlantic liberalism has smashed <br>
      authoritarianism by military force.  (WWI, WWII, Cold War)<br>
<p>
      And we'll do it all over again if we have to.  <br>
<p>
      Even better, next time.<br>
<p>
