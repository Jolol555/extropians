I think this is THE important point in this issue. As I first subscribed<br>
to this mailing-list, I was kinda shocked by what I read in the<br>
introduction. The rules put up there sound really restrictive.<br>
Unfortunately, many people seem to have forgotten that introduction -<br>
and no one seems to enforce it...<br>
<p>
Maybe regularly posting this introduction could help!<br>
<p>
Answering the question posed in the subject I have to say that many of<br>
the threads are quite interesting and I really appreciate being on this<br>
list - even when I don't have the time to read it a lot anymore (if<br>
there was less "noise" this may change...)<br>
<p>
later,<br>
Holger<br>
