That question bugged me a lot until I read the Extropy-FAQ. There, you <br>
find a description of uploading - which is a process where you add <br>
technology to your brain one at a time, so your consciousness gets used <br>
to it. This way it's always you (but an improved version of you)...<br>
(I'm sure someone else can explain this a lot better)<br>
<p>
If you copy your brain, I'm quite sure that there will not be any change <br>
to your consciousness - but you may have created a new instance of you. <br>
It will probably develop independently from you. This means: you remain <br>
the same, but there's another 'being' who exactly resembles you in the <br>
beginning. Since you will have different experiences, after a while there <br>
may be two quite different 'beings'...<br>
<p>
I think there's also something called merging (which would probably be <br>
very interesting), but I know nothing about that...<br>
<p>
I think the major question is: where is your consciousness. I believe <br>
that a 'consciousness' can only exist in one single instance that is <br>
somehow networked (that means, a network could have a consciousness - but <br>
not two seperate networks). This means that uploading your consciousness <br>
can only happen gradually.<br>
