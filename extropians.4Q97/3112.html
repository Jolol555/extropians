Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;The test is for our benefit, not his.  </i><br>
<p>
Ah.  Yes.  Then the entity has no real incentive to engage in such a<br>
test, because it is fraudulent.  It claims to *confer* rights, when<br>
in fact no one can confer a right.  In fact it actually confers<br>
*recognition* of a right, a status that the entity could claim by<br>
other means, given enough time and resources.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It tells us whether or not we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been enslaving him, and whether it might be more profitable for</i><br>
<i>&gt;us to recognize him as free, because free men produce more than slaves.</i><br>
<p>
Under a human rights paradigm, if the entity perceives that he has<br>
been enslaved, then it/he/she has probably been living under<br>
conditions of slavery.  If others cannot figure out whether they have <br>
been oppressing someone, the easiest method of finding that out would <br>
be to ask the entity, and to actually listen to the response, however <br>
difficult it may be to listen to.  Setting up a test to do so only <br>
shows that what the entity thinks and feels has been demoted in favor <br>
of the standards of a third party.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
