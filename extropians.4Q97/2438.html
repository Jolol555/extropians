Hi there folks. I've been reading this list for a few weeks now, but I just <br>
thought I should add, for the record, that there is at least one transhumanist <br>
living in Montreal.<br>
<p>
Oh, and I should point out that I consider myself a Transhumanist, and not an <br>
Extropian, since it has become clear to me that I have no idea WHAT the creator <br>
of this list means by the term Extropian. I joined this list under the belief <br>
(and the list info said nothing to change this belief) that extropy was <br>
someones pet term for transhumanism. It was not until the recent debate with <br>
the Dutch Excedo folks that I learned that the Extropy Institute considered it <br>
had ownership of the term, and of this mailinglist. So, if the list becomes <br>
pay-only, I'll probably drop out, since I haven't yet been convinced I want to <br>
be an Extropian, whatever that is.<br>
<p>
And finally, on the topic of Signal-to-Noise ratios, I think you folks are <br>
spoiled. I'm a member of something like 15 assorted mailing lists, and this one <br>
has one of the highest S/N ratios for an unmoderated list that I've ever seen.<br>
<p>
