PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 345 November 7, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben<br>
Stein<br>
<p>
GRAVITATIONAL FRAME-DRAGGING IS OBSERVED.  Just<br>
as an electric charge emits an electric field and (if the charge is in<br>
motion) a magnetic field, so a massive body should, according to<br>
general relativity, emit a static gravitational field and (if the body<br>
is moving or rotating) an extra "gravitomagnetic" field (see Update<br>
295 and the accompanying figure).  Two groups of astronomers,<br>
one based in Rome (Luigi Stella, stella@coma.mporzio.astro.it) and<br>
one at MIT (Wei Cui, cui@space.mit.edu), now claim to have<br>
detected experimental evidence for this force in the form of subtle<br>
modulations in the x-ray signals coming from neutron stars and<br>
monitored by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite.<br>
The phenomenon is sometimes called "frame dragging" since its<br>
source is the distortions of space-time caused by the rotating mass. <br>
The results were reported yesterday at the High Energy<br>
Astrophysics Division meeting of the American Astronomical<br>
Society in Colorado.<br>
<p>
BOILING TOPOLOGY.  If Einstein hadn't introduced the so-called<br>
cosmological constant (a fudge factor, denoted by the Greek letter<br>
Lambda, meant to preserve the then-apparent static density of the<br>
universe) into his gravitational equations, nature might have<br>
invented one anyway.  For one thing, according  to modern field<br>
theories, the vacuum is not empty but filled with virtual particles<br>
which (through a process called quantum fluctuations) zip into and<br>
out of existence, and Lambda has come to be seen as the energy<br>
density of the vacuum.  Furthermore, the "inflationary" version of<br>
the big bang model calls for something like a nonzero Lambda in<br>
order to expand the early universe at a rate much higher than we<br>
observe today.  The universe having evolved to its present state,<br>
however, it would now be convenient if Lambda were very close to<br>
zero. Although not presenting a complete theory of quantum<br>
gravity,  Steven Carlip (UC Davis, 916-752-8786,carlip@dirac.<br>
ucdavis.edu) has at least sought to explain the<br>
Lambda mystery in a model which spans the distance scales from<br>
near the Planck realm (10^-35 m), where space becomes granular<br>
(and where the fluctuations arise), all the way up to the<br>
cosmological scale (10 billion light years). Carlip compares the<br>
universe to a pot of water being heated. The addition of energy<br>
makes the water hotter, but only up to the boiling point. Thereafter,<br>
more energy serves only to boil the water faster. Analogously,<br>
larger Lambdas only make the universe "boil" more.  That is, the<br>
topology of space-time is merely driven into an ever more<br>
complicated tangle of subtle distortions and wormholes. Carlip's<br>
framework, which calls upon recent developments in group theory<br>
and non-Euclidean geometry,  makes it very unlikely that Lambda<br>
would have a negative value, and may well explain why Lambda is<br>
so close to zero.(Physical Review Letters, tent. 24 Nov.; as usual,<br>
