<i>&gt;&gt; Some people outside this list agree with you -- viz., that uplifting</i><br>

<i>&gt;No, no. I'm not talking about uplifting, which I find to be pretty fascinating.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm talking about a mere cross-breed of chimp and human. What would be</i><br>

<p>
Again: cheap, quick way to uplift.  It's kind of like the poor man's uplift<br>
experiment.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  What standard do we</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The question is better put, what standard do *you* use to judge? Moral</i><br>
relativism<br>
<i>&gt;is serving me well these days...</i><br>
<p>
Then, it is not wrong _objectively_ to you to cross-breed?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But scientists do have ethical guidelines for themselves. Unfortunately, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't help much when you're stuck in the middle of a gray area.</i><br>
<p>
Guidelines are not perfect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;1. Will crossbreeding chimps and humans help us augment human beings?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I believe my initial post answers this question.  The data from it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; also give us more parameters on just how far intelligence can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stretched inside the biotic realm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If your above suggestion is true (not just hand-waving), then it may be a valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason. I don't want to argue the merits, but suffice it to say, if I were</i><br>
<i>&gt;deciding funding, I'd need some pretty good evidence.</i><br>
<p>
Understood.  I actually think crossbreeding would not help much.  It would<br>
be too<br>
random/chaotic.  I doubt it would produce viable much less fertile<br>
offspring.  The<br>
only reason I went on with this was to clear up matters in my own head.  I do<br>
think, though, that uplifting chimps by other methods might prove helpful in<br>
augmenting humans.  Also, I suspect, a lot of the developmental patterns are<br>
similar between apes and humans, such that insertion of genetic sequences<br>
might have similar effects in both.<br>
