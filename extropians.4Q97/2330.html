I should emphasize that my point was that the absolute price of oil in<br>
the US is lower that it "should" be.  Although Michael may be right<br>
that the price was a little bit higher relative to the standard US<br>
price these days, the fact remains that it never got even close to the<br>
price that it would be in a completely free market.<br>
