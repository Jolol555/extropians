<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;On the other hand, if it is claimed the end reference purpose for</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;called "God", "Nature", whatever,  is immaterial. A purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;existing independently of individual creating necessarily implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;a volitional source existing independently of individual. Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;the former. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let me be the first, then. I claim the former.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;O.K. have at it.  In setting your personal values as a "code of morality",</i><br>
<i>&gt;does it not logically follow that anyone who holds a personal preference, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;preferences, different from yours is considered by you to hold "immoral</i><br>
<i>&gt;values?" </i><br>
<p>
Having defined morality as a strong individual statement of universal<br>
intent, I recognize that others, having different personal values, may have<br>
different intentions. It is in my interests to judge whether those<br>
intentions pose a danger to others, and thus potentially, to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You say chocolate ice cream, another wants vanilla; you say brick</i><br>
<i>&gt;house, another prefers frame; you say no theft, another says steal. What</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have not said is by what rationale your values and preferences are</i><br>
<i>&gt;superior as implied by your declaration. </i><br>
<p>
Knowing their moral intent, I may predict their future behavior, and judge<br>
them to be potential friend, or potential foe. From my viewpoint, a<br>
potential friend is more valuable to me than a potential foe, and his values<br>
thus superior.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If all other individuals are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;afforded the same claim of "morality" via personal preferences, don't you</i><br>
<i>&gt;feel obliged to explain how and why they are excluded from the criteria you</i><br>
<i>&gt;assert as fact for yourself? If each is afforded the same criteria, and each</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual is of equal standing, if in a given instance you say "moral" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;another says "immoral", do we not have a sum, zero; meaning that the term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;morality, has no  meaning? </i><br>
<p>
When I say "moral" it has meaning to me and to others. When others say<br>
"immoral" it has meaning to them and to me. It communicates intent. Is it a<br>
hand or a fist?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;behavior. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be reasonably</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To be sure, you, I, and\or anyone else may agree not to steal, nor initiate</i><br>
<i>&gt;force and coercion in any way. This will, as you say, result in a peaceful</i><br>
<i>&gt;coexistence. I have no quarrel with the conclusion. The conclusion is</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflected in natural law as pertains to means and ends. The means selected</i><br>
<i>&gt;and applied are right because they result in the end mutually desired and</i><br>
<i>&gt;identified. Here choosing and implementing right means (suited to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose) you call "morally right." </i><br>
<p>
In accordance with my personal values and goals, yes. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, suppose we agree to steal and</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce a hostile coexistence?  Once again, the means selected and applied</i><br>
<i>&gt;produces the end mutually desired and identified. Would you then call this</i><br>
<i>&gt;"morally wrong" although you agreed to it? </i><br>
<p>
If I called it "morally wrong" that would be a fraudulent statement<br>
concerning my universal intent. The end selected, however, poses a potential<br>
danger to others, and I would expect them to consider that end, and the<br>
means of achieving it, to be immoral. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's look at the third option: Suppose the end you choose is peaceful</i><br>
<i>&gt;coexistence and select the appropriate means, non theft, etc. to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;this end, but another within your social realm prefers a hostile enviroment</i><br>
<i>&gt;and selects predatory means appropriate to achieve this end. Since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;predatory means chosen will produce the hostile environment end desired, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not these means chosen technically right the same as yours are technically</i><br>
<i>&gt;right? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, they are the technically right means for achieving his desired ends.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What remains for you to call wrong, and why? The end chosen, is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;not? Thus must you presume to qualify terms, and arrive at: Technically</i><br>
<i>&gt;right, but "morally wrong." Right AND wrong applied to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumstance?  True, yet false? Exist, yet does not exist? Dead, yet alive?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doesn't this make you a bit suspicious of the concept, morality?  </i><br>
<p>
You are mixing his means with my ends...and vice versa. He has chosen the<br>
right path, from his POV, to the wrong destination, from my POV. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The confusion, conflicts and contradictions are derived from illusory</i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs that lead to pursuit of the impossible. An end chosen is a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt;volition, a natural condition that is not subject to proof or disproof. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;is means and only means that are subject to evaluation as right or wrong. To</i><br>
<i>&gt;presume to evaluate a chosen end as right or wrong is to claim the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual creator of said end as personal property to be evaluated as means</i><br>
<i>&gt;to one's own goal. </i><br>
<p>
I make no such claim. I simply predict his future behavior and act<br>
accordingly. I judge his moral values to be dangerous to others, and<br>
consider it to be moral to defend myself. I will not aggress against him,<br>
but will defend against his aggression. This combination (the primethic<br>
decision) precludes claiming others as personal property.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, what is "morality", that is  what is the meaning of the term, and by</i><br>
<i>&gt;reference to what is the meaning derived? I can find not a trace of</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective criteria except subjective personal preference as you acknowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ergo, "morality" is dependent on being created by individual mind. Having</i><br>
<i>&gt;examined and weighed all the factors known to me from root premise to end</i><br>
<i>&gt;result, I  am obliged to accept the definition that corresponds to the</i><br>
evidence:<br>
<p>
Morality is rooted in the objectively observable phenomenon of<br>
aggression/defense. It comes from the fact that humans, as volitional<br>
creatures, must necessarily choose to defend themselves against aggression,<br>
and decide that it is "right" to do so. The far less desirable alternative<br>
survival strategy is to subjugate themselves to aggressors, thus losing<br>
volition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Morality is a FEELING; specifically a DOMINANT feeling of a "universal</i><br>
<i>&gt;ought" nearly universally felt. It is a feeling that there exists an</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective and universal standard of values. It is a feeling that one "ought"</i><br>
<i>&gt;to discover and live by these values. It is a feeling that most individual's</i><br>
<i>&gt;look to and depend on to measure their self value and the value of others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is a feeling that directs thoughts, conclusions, beliefs and actions like</i><br>
<i>&gt;no other. It is the ultimate warden of the psyche. It is the ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt;religion for it commands more subservience of more individuals that all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;others put together.</i><br>
<p>
It is defense against aggression. It is a reluctance to subjugate oneself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since "morality" is a matter of feelings peculiar to each individual, (but</i><br>
<i>&gt;believed to be an objective dictate of nature), is it any wonder that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;endless disagreements are endlessly "resolved" by violent conflict?  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept, morality, is by billions believed to be an absolute necessity for</i><br>
<i>&gt;peaceful coexistence. They believe this even as the earth has been for</i><br>
<i>&gt;centuries, and still is, drenched in blood in the name of morality. </i><br>
<p>
This results not from morality, but from subjugation of will to others,<br>
whose ends are dangerous to others, and thus immoral. The aggressor's<br>
perceived need to convince their followers that their aggression is<br>
defensive, and thus moral, attests to the widespread existance of the<br>
primethic decision. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This</i><br>
<i>&gt;tells not of any truth of "morality", but of a suicidal and destructive</i><br>
<i>&gt;commitment to a revered and  dominant fallacy. "Morality" is just one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;many popular beliefs that are 180 out of phase with reality. For more, see  </i><br>
