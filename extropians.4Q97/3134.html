I'd rather not.  We need a more nuanced understanding of the social and<br>
political institutions necessary to maintain civilization in the face of<br>
the future (can you say the word singularity?) than libertarianism tends<br>
to provide, imho.  Smash the state, sure, but then what?  While<br>
privatizing and pluralizing functions presently performed (mostly<br>
brutally, always badly) by monolithic governments will definitely<br>
eliminate the State, nothing will eliminate government.  I read David<br>
Friedman's _Machinery of Freedom_ as a sketch of (some of) the kinds of<br>
institutions of rational governance that are likely to survive the<br>
dissolution of the nation-state over the course of the next half-century,<br>
rather than as a recipe for eliminating government altogether.  It is<br>
useful to distinguish the notion of government as a word for the practices<br>
and institutional arrangements that emerge to deal with discord and<br>
articulate the flows of meaning, value, and force among a plurality of<br>
actors, and State as the word for the fiction that some one institution<br>
can be assigned this task by maintaining a monopoly on the "legitimate"<br>
recourse to physical force. <br>
