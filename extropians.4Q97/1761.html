 Mary Anne  suggests the folowing                                                           <br>
<i>&gt;"In future we'll be saying to our partners "Your</i><br>
<i>&gt;network or mine?"  in fact, in the future who</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs partners.!!!</i><br>
 Indeed, and the possible conclusion to this line of thought is that<br>

 Kevin Warwick ( March of the Machines) anticipates the possibility of<br>
this within 20 to 30 years.   Within 50 years, Warwick believes " it will all<br>
be over." <br>
