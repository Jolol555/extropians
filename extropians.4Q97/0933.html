      The Power of Prayer<br>
      ===================<br>
<p>
     "In speculating about the nature of prayer, Ellen Johnson (leader of <br>
      American Atheists) wondered that "... a superintending, self-aware <br>
      conscious force in the Universe [could] upon whim, grant or refuse <br>
      certain supplications, and, if need be, suspend the laws of nature <br>
      to accomplish that which it would not have done otherwise.  In other <br>
      words, this divinity has an insatiable need to be entertained by the <br>
      act of prayer before performing what it is requested to do."<br>
<p>
      "Ellen Johnson's arguments were considered so extreme that the <br>
      American press did not report them.  Had it done so, she might have <br>
      been killed."<br>

      I started off as an Anglican (Episcopalian) Christian.  That Nicene <br>
      Creed, though -- 'six impossible things to believe before <br>
      breakfast!"  &gt;:-}  I do think prayer works, on many levels. <br>
      Fortunately, _none_ of these levels relies on supplications to any <br>
      divinity, insatiable or otherwise.  The 'God of Spinoza' knows what <br>
      you're thinking (you do, don't you?)<br>

      Silva Mind Control graduates access a Higher Intelligence (not God <br>
      -- you can be of any religion or none in the Silva system) for <br>
      information and assistance.  The full procedures are given in book <br>
      "The Silva Mind Control Method" by Jose Silva and Philip Miehle. <br>
<p>
      95% of the full value of the coursework is available through reading <br>
      the book, which is life-enhancing, full of 'gadgetry', and a joy to <br>
      read. There are full scientific evaluations of the course outcomes <br>
      in appendices. It's always in print. Coursework is quicker, is all.<br>
<p>
      There are over six million Silva Graduates worldwide now.<br>
<p>

<p>
      For the next process, you just need to be able to settle your mind <br>
      into an 'Alpha' (EEG) meditative state. Those who find meditation <br>
      difficult can purchase a simple EEG electronic sound-and-light <br>
      brain-frequency entrainment device for the purpose. Works infallibly <br>
      in around five seconds for me (Synetics MindLab kit -- very nice!).<br>
<p>
      Actualizations:  you can now connect your dreamed-of events with <br>
      their actually occurring. There are just four Laws to observe, in <br>
      making anything happen:<br>
<p>
      [1]  You must _desire_ that the event shall take place.<br>
<p>
      [2]  You must _believe_ that the event _can_ take place.<br>
<p>
      [3]  You must _expect_ the event to take place.<br>
<p>
      [4]  You _cannot_ create a hurtful problem for other people.<br>

      Then there's (ferinstance) Classical Greek Magic.  Very powerful <br>
      systems.  They've worked for several thousand years.  Read Murry <br>
      Hope's brilliant work "Practical Greek Magic: A Guide to the unique <br>
      magical system of Classical Greece" (The Aquarian Press, [1985]).  <br>
      Great fun, also.   [ FX: "FLASH!!!" ]<br>

  <br>
      Then there's the WishCraft System: just enter your wishes (anything <br>
      non-injurious to others) on 3 x 5 postcards or in computer file <br>
      entries, in this format:<br>
<p>
<p>
      TITLE:  &lt;Five or six word summary or title&gt;<br>
  <br>
      TEXT:  Fifty to a hundred words describing your sought-for item, <br>
      project, desire, offer, whatever...<br>
      <br>
      CONTACT:  Details of how you want to be contacted -- bg telephone, <br>
      email, snail-mail, synchronicity, dreams or whatever.<br>
<p>
      You only need to send your wishes by email to me, if they haven't <br>
      'happened' for you in seven days.  KISS...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      We're working on a Web site for WishCraft wishes: any bright <br>
      forms-oriented site designers wanna help?  Email me.<br>

      ===========================-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
      Best of all, I'm working on an integrated suite of Multi-Media <br>
      programmes offering all of the above benefits and facilities, and <br>
      more.  "Bring Your Dreams Alive!"  (There _are_ no silly Freudian <br>
      'ids' to worry about, you should know).<br>
<p>
<p>
      And -- still -- you can always pray to Heaven.  Or Destiny.<br>
<p>
      And to God.<br>
<p>
<p>
POSTSCRIPT:<br>
<p>
      The other day, I was standing in my living-room, staring out of my <br>
      living-room window with a 'fixed and terrible intensity', as I <br>
      though through a very difficult problem.  (Coincidentally: I had <br>
      been talking earlier on the phone about John Paul Vann's heroic <br>
      defence of Kontum in the Vietnam War, where his forward air fire <br>
      control commanders Rhotenberry and Ba were calling down B-52 ARC <br>
      LIGHT air strikes from three mile high to impact within 700 yards of <br>
      their own positions (Ref: Neil Sheehan, 'A Bright Shining Lie' -- <br>
      [1987] -- magnificent book!).<br>
<p>
      <br>
      At _exactly_ the instant the solution came to my mind, a brilliant <br>
      blue-gold flash of lightning struck down vertically  just 700 yards <br>
      away, accompanied instantaneously by a crash of thunder.  The sky <br>
      turned black, and an inch of rain fell in half an hour.  The <br>
      resultant local flooding was reported on national broadcast news.<br>
<p>
      This sure impressed me!  &gt;:-}<br>

       "You have to believe we are magic;<br>
        Nothing can stand in our way.<br>
        You have to believe we are magic;<br>
        Don't let your aim ever stray...<br>
<p>
        And if all your Hopes survive,<br>
        Destiny will arrive,<br>
        And bring _all your dreams alive_<br>
        For you."  <br>
