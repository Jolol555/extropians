I don't really think we need any new automated mechanisms, or that new<br>
rules must be enforced.  All I wanted to do was to remind people that we<br>
have in the past adopted a policy of not endlessly debating these basics.<br>
<p>
It's ironic.  We tell people that 30 years from now everyone will turn<br>
into an immortal superman, and they say ho hum.  But if you suggest<br>
that somebody ought to be able to work for less than the minimum wage,<br>
all hell breaks loose.<br>
<p>
I remember a joke from Mad magazine.  The boss comes down hard on this<br>
guy for spending 55 cents extra on office supplies.  The clerk says, "But<br>
boss, you authorize millions of dollars in expenditures all the time.<br>
What's the big deal about a few cents?"  The boss answers, "Frankly,<br>
when I work with these huge amounts, I don't really have a sense of how<br>
big they are.  Fifty-five cents - now that, I understand!"<br>
<p>
The libertarian aspect of extropianism is the part which most people can<br>
understand, I guess.<br>
