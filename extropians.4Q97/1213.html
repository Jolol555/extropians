               <br>
It could be true, but it won't be easy to prove it.<br>

                    <br>
But can you identify ALL the points or just some of them ? <br>

OK.<br>
  <br>

<i>        &gt;is 2^aleph-null,         </i><br>
       <br>
OK. <br>
<i>        &gt;and that is the number of points on the line.</i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
That's the problem. To prove it you'd have to find a one to one correspondence <br>
between a set with 2^alepha-null members and the points on a line. You'd have <br>
little difficulty with the rational numbers, those that can be expressed as <br>
ratios of whole numbers, like 5/7, but then you'd also have to deal with <br>
numbers that are not fractions but are the solution to some polynomial <br>
equation, like the square root of 2, after that you'd also have to deal with <br>
numbers that are  not fractions or the solution to any polynomial equation <br>
but can be expressed as the sum of an infinite sequence, such as PI or e. <br>
After you've done all that your problems would have just begun because then <br>
you'd have to deal with Chaitin's numbers such as... well, actually only one <br>
of them has a name but there are an awful lot of them.<br>
  <br>
About 20 years ago Gregory Chaitin extended Turing's work on non computable <br>
numbers and proved that for ever number that can be found by a deterministic <br>
method, such as the ones I mentioned above, there are an infinite (class <br>
unknown) number that can not. Almost all the points in a line are Chaitin <br>
numbers, but none of us has ever seen one, or ever well. The only way to find<br>
a Chaitin number is to let heads be one and tails be zero and then flip a <br>
coin an infinite number of times. Because they can not be generated by any <br>
deterministic process it's very hard to count them, that is, to put them in <br>
a one to one correspondence with a set on a known size in a mathematical <br>
proof, but a reliable method must be found to prove the Continuum Hypothesis.<br>
Current number theory is not up to the challenge.<br>
