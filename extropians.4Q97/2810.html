<i>&gt;and 95%.  So, my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the US is between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed</i><br>
<i>&gt;nations, and the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My conclusion: if a society has easy access firearms, they will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;used to cause many more murders than would occur without the easy</i><br>
<i>&gt;access.</i><br>
<p>
I am not sure about those numbers. But permit me to suggest that your<br>
phrase "a society" begs several questions. For better or worse, some<br>
would argue that the culture of West J'bipp is substantially different<br>
from the culture of Compton or Miami.<br>
<p>
I think the "slack" you mention might be taken up _there_: I'd believe<br>
a 1-to-10 ratio in murder rates between Early, Nebraska and<br>
Washington, DC. Are they one society, just because they both pay taxes<br>
to a government that may have complicity in running crack to the<br>
latter, and not to the former? Anit-racist-tarbrush observation:<br>
Farrakhan (whom I deprecate) and Spike Lee (whom I do not) have asked<br>
the same kind of questions.<br>
<p>
Further, America has the highest incarceration rate with the stupidest<br>
parole/mandatory time policies. Try factoring *that* in and you may<br>
see another contributing factor or two emerge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You can try drawing other conclusions, such as "the government will</i><br>
<i>&gt;find it much easier to impose unpopular violations of freedom", and</i><br>
<i>&gt;you may be right.  And that may indeed be a good reason to allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens to be armed.  I DO NOT ARGUE THAT POINT.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, if you think that there's no price, in the form of blood on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the streets and in homes, for allowing citizens to be armed, you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;misguided, for the facts are clearly against you.  "The price of</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom is eternal vigilance."  Perhaps to that we should add, "and</i><br>
<i>&gt;some extra blood in the form of societal violence."</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely. Bullies and fools don't go away. There is always a price<br>
for every real choice.<br>
