<i>&gt;No I just get knida tired of hearing people making preposterous</i><br>
<i>&gt;statements.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The composite body of a Hypercar is not paper-mache thin, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fact its monocoque construction makes it much stronger than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; conventional car and probably your 1/2 ton pickup.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not bloody likely. Ever wonder why more vehicle occupants that are</i><br>
<i>&gt;hit by trucks are killed than occupants of the trucks??? Law of</i><br>
<i>&gt;inertia. A smaller vehicle is a)not going to have the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;structural strength as a much larger utility vehicle and b) will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be stopped faster than a larger vehicle, causing much more</i><br>
<i>&gt;traumatic injury.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It will not crumple like tissue paper.If I could not stop short</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ofthe Moose, I would accelerate. (law of inertia you know.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;letting Mr Moose with his now broken legs land behind me.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Considering that ALL cars are now required to be designed with</i><br>
<i>&gt;what are known as "crumple zones", I highly doubt that this would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be the case.</i><br>
<p>
Hypercars:  Safety, Performance, and Aesthetics<br>
<p>
<p>
A common generic objection to fuel-efficient cars is their alleged<br>
crash risk. But this confuses fuel economy, mass, size, and design.<br>
<p>
Fuel economy and light weight need not compromise safety. There is<br>
no correlation, far less a causal relationship, between present<br>
cars' crash-test performance and their mass, nor between their fuel<br>
economy and their on-the-road death rate(67a,67b). That is chiefly<br>
because occupant protection systems are lightweight, and because<br>
vehicles' design and materials are vastly more important than their<br>
mass. It may also be partly because light cars can avoid more<br>
accidents by stopping sooner and handling more nimbly(68a,68b).<br>
<p>
Existence proofs suggest that the general lessons invited from<br>
gross correlations between light cars and higher death rates are<br>
misleading. Americans can now buy a 4,2 l/100 km (56 mi/gal) car<br>
with a lower death rate than a 10,2 l/100 km (23 mi/gal) car; cars<br>
with identical efficiencies but over tenfold-different death rates;<br>
and cars at any mass that differ in crashworthiness by more than<br>
tenfold. Such comparisons reveal some unusually dangerous cars now<br>
on the road at various levels of mass and fuel economy, but they<br>
make no case that fuel economy does or must conflict with superior<br>
safety(69a,69b) Rather, their high scatter emphasizes the<br>
importance of design differences.<br>
<p>
Theoretically, collisions between two cars identical except in mass<br>
tend to damage the lighter car more. (Practically, this is often<br>
incorrect because other, unequal factors such as design dominate.<br>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought to show<br>
the danger of light cars in recent light/heavy crash tests; the<br>
light cars reportedly came off better until stronger heavy cars and<br>
flimsier light cars were substituted.) This idealized theory leads<br>
some to propose that you should drive a heavier car--thus reducing<br>
such collisions' risk to yourself while raising others' risk<br>
correspondingly(70a,70b) But the right answer is to make all cars<br>
(71a,71b)s afe whatever their weight, without putting all the<br>
adjustment burden on light cars. Heavier vehicles should be made<br>
less aggressive (Kdser 1992)--softer, less angular, more<br>
absorptive, with bigger ridedown distances--and the road fleet's<br>
mass distribution should be further narrowed, e.g. by incentives<br>
for replacing inefficient with efficient cars (section 11). Heavy<br>
lorries  with slightly relaxed length limits could even be equipped<br>
with a highly energy-absorbing structure on the front to help<br>
protect any car they might hit (M. Seal, personal communication, 24<br>
March 1993).<br>
<p>
Better control of destructive driver behaviour such as drunkenness<br>
is often crucial: behaviour may be up to a thousandfold more<br>
risk-determining than the car itself (L. Evans, personal<br>
communication, 1992), and only about a twentieth of crashes do not<br>
involve driver factors (Evans 1991). But as to the car, modern<br>
designs and materials can do far better than Henry Ford had in mind<br>
when, in 1926, he said that " A heavy man cannot run as well as a<br>
trim man. You do not need weight for strength"; (S. Abouzar,<br>
personal communication, 3 July 1991).<br>
<p>
GM's Ultralite confirms that mass per unit volume can be cut by<br>
more than half below the "steel plateau" level. This decoupling<br>
permits fuel-efficient cars to remain ultralight while combining<br>
roomy interiors with ample crush length, which appears to improve<br>
crash performance somewhat. Yet better materials and design can<br>
also substitute for crush length.<br>
<p>
Composites and other ultrastrong net-shape materials--many stronger<br>
than the familiarly durable but lower-grade carbon-fibre fishing<br>
rods, skis, etc.--would dominate in a hypercar. They would bounce<br>
without damage in minor fender-bender collisions: most deformations<br>
of carbon-fibre composite panels simply pop out again with little<br>
or no damage. Under severe loads, composite structures fail very<br>
differently than metal, so "totally different design concepts have<br>
to be applied", and understanding of failure modes is not yet<br>
mature. However, even under compressive loading--often considered<br>
composites' weak point(72b,72a,)"Composite structural<br>
elements...show high and in many cases better energy absorption<br>
performance than comparable metal structures" (Kindervater 1991)<br>
(73a,73b) Extensive aerospace experience is available from<br>
designing all-composite structures and aircraft (like the Stealth<br>
bomber and fighter) to withstand bird and stone strikes, landing<br>
stress, etc.<br>
<p>
Light metals would also be used where appropriate, such as in<br>
sections of crushable light-metal foam or honeycomb for energy<br>
management in a serious crash. These materials, available for two<br>
decades (APS 1975), have a nearly perfect square-wave<br>
response--they squash flat, absorbing enormous energy, before<br>
transmitting crash accelerations--making them an ideal substitute<br>
for ridedown length.<br>
<p>
Other crash-energy-managing design options include buckling<br>
members, down-deflecting heavy driveline components, filament-wound<br>
or sheet-and-keel(74b,74a)cruciforms, and "impact beams(75a,75b)<br>
Composite prototype and small-production cars and vans with<br>
proprietary crash structures have in fact yielded some of the best<br>
crash-test results ever recorded by a major automaker; some were<br>
probably driveable after a 56-km/h barrier crash (P.H. Magnuson and<br>
major-automaker experts, personal communications, March 1993;<br>
Grosse 1992).<br>
<p>
An ultralight car using ultrastrong materials, modern airbag<br>
restraint systems, and crash-energy-managing design can weigh less<br>
than half as much as today's platforms--as the Ultralite does--yet<br>
be far safer than any car now sold. That is why racedrivers are<br>
rarely killed nowadays when composite cars hit walls at  350 km/h:<br>
as tens of millions of Americans saw on their 1992 tv news, the<br>
composite car flies to bits, failing at "sections specifically<br>
designed to initiate such breakaway and absorbing extensive crash<br>
energy through controlled failure modes," but the "survival<br>
capsule" remains intact and the driver generally limps away with<br>
perhaps a broken foot. To be sure, ordinary drivers would lack the<br>
racedriver's helmet, fitted foam restraints, spaceframe, etc., but<br>
even in a head-on collision their lower speeds would imply<br>
one-fourth the racedrivers' crash energy, and even if they were<br>
more seriously injured, that would be a great improvement on their<br>
fate in today's cars(76a,76b).<br>
<p>
The main potential safety disadvantages(77b,77a)of the ultralight<br>
hybrids described in section section 6-7 are that with their low<br>
drag and low or absent engine noise, pedestrians may not hear them<br>
coming unless a noisemaker is added that somehow warns without<br>
being objectionable, and obstacles such as small trees, crash<br>
barriers, and lampposts, against which a heavy car can dissipate<br>
energy by breaking or deforming them, may instead stop a light car<br>
or make it bounce off, increasing deceleration and perhaps<br>
bounceback acceleration forces on passengers(78a,78b)<br>
<p>
But beyond their general crashworthiness described above, such<br>
"hypercars" also offer important safety features. The 2- or (with<br>
series hybrids) 4-wheel switched reluctance drives offer full-time<br>
antilock braking and antiskid traction, but with far greater<br>
balance, response speed, and effectiveness than today's methods.<br>
<p>
Hypercars' light weight means faster starts and stops; their stiff<br>
shell, quicker and more precise handling.<br>
<p>
Carbon-fibre designs can be so stiff and bouncy that an ultralight<br>
car, if broadsided by a heavy lorry, could go flying--like kicking<br>
an empty coffee-can. The very unfavourable momentum transfer would<br>
go not into mashing the ultralight car but into launching it. Yet<br>
occupants restrained by belts, bags, and headrests and protected<br>
from intrusion into their protection space might well survive<br>
unless accelerated by more than the often survivable ~40-60 g<br>
range--in which case they'd be dead anyway in any car today, light<br>
or heavy, steel or composite.<br>
<p>
In the rare accidents so severe as to crush the composite shell<br>
(usually in hammer-and-anvil fashion), the occupants would be far<br>
less likely to be injured than by intruding torn metal edges in a<br>
steel car; with any potentially intruding carbon-fibre shards<br>
overlain by or interwoven into fracture-masking aramid or<br>
polyethylene cloth, the crushed composite sections can become<br>
relatively innocuous.<br>
<p>
Victims' extrication would be much faster (a crucial element of<br>
critical medical care--most victims not dead on the spot can be<br>
saved if brought to hospital within an hour): the doors are<br>
likelier to function, the composite shell can provide easier<br>
access(79,79a) cutting it with a rotary wheel is quick and makes no<br>
sparks to ignite fuel vapours, and breakaway energy-absorbing main<br>
components would no longer impede access to the passenger<br>
compartment.<br>
Ultralights' decoupling of mass from volume makes it<br>
straightforward to maintain a wide track and long wheelbase for<br>
rollover resistance.<br>
<p>
Hydroplaning risk should not rise and may fall, because the car<br>
weighs less but has narrower tires.<br>
<p>
The small powertrain volume and raked bonnet are consistent with<br>
improved visibility and, as Dr Michael Seal suggests, with<br>
headlamps behind the bottom of the windscreen (so they are cleaned<br>
by the same wipers). The hidden headlamps are also exceptionally<br>
powerful and can cause road markers and certain textiles to<br>
fluoresce.<br>
<p>
With careful design, composites', especially foamcore composites',<br>
excellent attenuation of noise and vibration could yield an<br>
extremely quiet ride--important because road noise is no longer<br>
masked by engine noise(80a,80b) This plus the virtually complete<br>
absence of wind noise should make driving less fatiguing,<br>
potentially boosting driver alertness.<br>
<p>
"The whole car is so simple, reliable, corrosion-resistant,<br>
fault-tolerant, and failsafe-designable that dangerous mechanical<br>
failures are far less likely."<br>
<p>
For all these reasons, the design approach described here could<br>
yield substantially improved safety. Hypercars could also offer<br>
ample comfort, unprecedented durability and ease of repair,<br>
exceptional quietness (sound-deadening materials, no wind noise, no<br>
squeaks), beautiful finish and styling while retaining significant<br>
stylistic flexibility, impeccable fit and weatherproofness, high<br>
performance (light weight means faster acceleration), unmatched<br>
reliability, and--as we shall see next--probably low cost.<br>
<p>
One caveat is in order, however. Especially in the litigious United<br>
States, innovation is deterred by the threat that makers of new and<br>
hence initially "unproven" technologies may have to pay damage<br>
claims even for accidents in which they are blameless. Some experts<br>
fear that such potential liability might add exposure up to several<br>
thousand ECU or $ per car-year, especially for manufacturers large<br>
enough to invite lawsuits but not large enough to defeat them.<br>
Absent tort reform, removing this important barrier to market entry<br>
may require some government indemnity or coinsurance to makers of<br>
hypercars meeting a national safety standard, at least until<br>
actuarial experience has field-validated their theoretical ability<br>
to match or exceed the safety of today's cars(81a,81b).<br>
<p>
<p>
Endnotes<br>
<p>
67a Historic data must be interpreted with care. Until 1985, the<br>
U.S. accident population was only ~15% restrained by belts and<br>
airbags, rising to ~50% in 1990 (D. Friedman, personal<br>
communications, March 1993). Although admirably extensive analyses<br>
of mass vs. safety have been performed (e.g., Evans 1991), the<br>
higher crash death rates observed in the average of today's light<br>
cars (but certainly not in all models) are for a fleet all built<br>
with broadly similar methods and materials, and hence cannot be<br>
used to predict the safety of the completely new kinds of cars<br>
proposed here.<br>
<p>
68b Such effects are almost impossible to measure because, for<br>
example, larger cars (which tend to be heavier with currently<br>
dominant designs) tend to drive more miles, carry more people, and<br>
be driven in less urban settings (hence at higher speeds) and in<br>
riskier ways, while smaller cars tend to have younger drivers who<br>
are more crash-prone but survive better (Evans 1991, pp. 75-76)<br>
<p>
69a A car-design variable strongly correlated with risk is<br>
acceleration--a fact unmentioned since Detroit intensified its<br>
marketing of muscle cars.<br>
<p>
70a,70b As Evans (1991) states,"When a crash occurs, other factors<br>
being equal[:] The lighter the vehicle, the less risk to other road<br>
users. The heavier the vehicle, the less risk to its occupants " <br>
The opposite should therefore also be true.<br>
<p>
71A,71B And light trucks and sports utility vehicles. In the United<br>
States these were exempted from safety requirements, and their<br>
crash-test performance shows it.<br>
<p>
72A,72B This varies with composition: the ratio of strength in<br>
tension to that in compression is approximately 1 for most carbon<br>
fibre, 3-4 for aramid, and up to 10 for high-performance<br>
polyethylene. Among many proofs of the right composites'<br>
suitability for compressional loads, a carbon/epoxy unmanned<br>
minisubmarine exhibited no fibre breakage at pressures equivalent<br>
to 7 km depth (G.M. Wood and D.A. Waters, personal communication,<br>
26 March 1993).<br>
  <br>
73,73B For example (Kindervater 1991), in "fracture dominated<br>
crushing modes of carbon or hybrid [carbon-aramid] composite<br>
tubes[,] specific energies over 100 kJ/kg [with nearly 100% crush<br>
force efficiency AE, i.e., nearly ideal plastic energy absorption]<br>
could be obtained compared to 60 kJ/kg...in the best aluminium<br>
configurations." Specific energy absorption equal to that of<br>
aluminium tubes, at comparable or somewhat lower AE, can also be<br>
obtained from sinewave-beam composite assemblies. For such reasons,<br>
composites are predicted within the next ten years to be used "for<br>
up to 80 percent of the structural weight of a helicopter." To be<br>
sure, "Pure carbon fibre reinforced laminates under compression<br>
loading can have extremely high energy absorption capability but<br>
disintegrate completely into small laminate fragments," but<br>
"Hybridization with tougher fibres such as Kevlar or high<br>
performance polyethylene [stacked or in intraply weaves]...provides<br>
post crash structural integrity" with lower stiffness but also<br>
perhaps lower weight, since polyethylenes like Dyneema SK60 have<br>
specific gravity below unity.<br>
<p>
<p>
74A,74B Such a cruciform using hybrid composites to resist<br>
longitudinal crushing (of, say, an aircraft subfloor supported by<br>
cruciform pillars) absorbs ~3.25x the kJ/kg of an aluminium<br>
cruciform (Kindervater 1991); comparable U.S. automakers' findings<br>
are ~4.<br>
<p>
75A.75B Kdser (1992), of the Institute for Lightweight Structures<br>
at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Z|rich), shows that<br>
a foam- or honeycomb-filled, nearly rectangular beam wrapped around<br>
a light car (500-600 kg curb weight, 2,5-2,8 m overall length) can<br>
decelerate ~250-kN mean impacts at ~48 mean g without intrusion.<br>
"Higher impact forces and decelerations can be obtained with small<br>
modifications without significant increase of weight."<br>
<p>
76A,76B Given such an ultrasafe family car, you could in principle<br>
make it even a little safer in two-car collisions (albeit less able<br>
to maneuver to avoid them, and more hazardous to other cars) by<br>
using more mass, including more of those same safety-producing<br>
materials.  But you may not want to, because the marginal cost<br>
would be relatively high, the marginal benefit relatively low, and<br>
the performance penalty from mass compounding possibly substantial.<br>
However, the better the regenerative braking, the smaller the mass<br>
penalty--hybrids scale up well--so some extra mass yielding<br>
potentially large increments of safety could be accommodated if<br>
desired. Our conclusions therefore do not depend on extrapolating<br>
our qualitative safety conclusions to the extremely lightweight<br>
frontiers of the 400-kg Ultima. <br>
<p>
77A,77B Minor ones might also exist, such as post-crash<br>
high-voltage conduction by uninsulated carbon fibres.<br>
<p>
78A,78B Such artificial barriers can be redesigned, but must still<br>
withstand natural forces.<br>
<p>
79a,79b The Ultralite's clamshell doors, for example, open up the<br>
entire side of the car at once, giving simultaneous full access to<br>
both the front and rear of the whole passenger compartment. Yet the<br>
thin carbon-fibre door, light enough to be lifted by a small child,<br>
is so strong that it provides adequate side impact resistance with<br>
no B-pillar.<br>
<p>
80a,80b Active noise cancellation works much better for engine<br>
noise than for road noise, but a tire tread has been proposed whose<br>
halves make out-of-phase sounds that tend to cancel at some<br>
frequencies (P. MacCready, personal communication, 4 March 1993).<br>
Interior quietness need not require much weight: some modern<br>
aircraft, for example, selectively filter out annoying frequency<br>
ranges with "inhomogeneous layers of polyimide foam."<br>
<p>
81a,81b AeroVironment (Monrovia, California) is coordinating a<br>
systematic exploration of the many public policy issues raised by<br>
integrating a new kind of vehicle, the electric "SubCar" into<br>
innovative transportation systems. Like anything different,<br>
including hypercars, the SubCar raises a host of issues from<br>
emissions to liability and insurance. For example, Consulier's<br>
2,59-meter-long, 5,9 l/100 km [40 mi/gal] "Ram-Chop" urban<br>
commuter-vanlet design, seating four abreast ahead of a &gt;1,4-m3<br>
over-engine cargo area, is so short that two can be parked<br>
end-to-end or side-by-side in one U.S. parking space, like Fiat's<br>
even shorter (2,1-m) 3-passenger Downtown (Autoweek 1993); but<br>
would that be legal?<br>
