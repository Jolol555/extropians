1. IRISH ACTIVIST GROUP SABOTAGES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROP<br>
In Ireland, an environmental activist group called the Gaelic<br>
Earth Liberation Front has destroyed a one-acre research crop of<br>
genetically engineered sugar beet. Under the auspices of the<br>
Irish Government, the crop was grown by the US chemical company<br>
Monsanto to develop a sugar beet variety resistant to a widely<br>
used herbicide. The Gaelic Earth Liberation Front said in a<br>
statement: "This was Ireland's first genetically engineered crop<br>
and we hope it will be the last." But of course it will not be<br>
the last, and one wonders if this is activism for the sake of<br>
activism by people who known little about the environment and<br>
even less about biology. Patricia McKenna, a politician who<br>
represents Dublin in the European Parliament, praised the<br>
destruction of the sugar beet crop, accusing Monsanto and the<br>
Irish government of "playing games with the Irish environment".<br>
And that underscores the non-triviality of these events. The neo-<br>
Luddite rumblings that are becoming common these days are useful<br>
to some people with political power, which means both the source<br>
of the rumblings and the politicians who use the rumblings need<br>
to be confronted by the scientific community. Ultimately it is<br>
the larger community which must be persuaded one way or the<br>
other; it is the attitude of the larger community that will<br>
determine the fate of the neo-Luddite groups and the politicians<br>
who use them. Concerning the science involved, what is obvious to<br>
the scientific community is not always obvious to the community<br>
at large, and one can only hope the scientific community will see<br>
its responsibility to make its case to the larger community by<br>
forceful and articulate dissemination of information. There is no<br>
other apparent reasonable road. (Nature 9 Oct 1997)<br>
