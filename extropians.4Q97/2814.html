<i>&gt; Subject: Re Look out! long hair gun loon!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Date: Saturday, December 20, 1997 7:06 PM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, after a bit more web surfing, I came upon a chart showing</i><br>
<i>&gt; murder rate is the US broken down by weapon.  The web page is</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp">http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; and the chart shows that between 1971 and 1995, the percentage</i><br>
<i>&gt; of murders that occur with firearms fluctates between about 80%</i><br>
<i>&gt; and 95%.  So, my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the US is between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; nations, and the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.</i><br>
<p>
Wayne,<br>
<p>
Please explain to me how you come up with the figures of  80-95% of<br>
homicides thru the use of firearms when the year with the highest figure<br>
(1974) was only 71.3%.<br>
<p>
As a resident of the state in question, and as a father of three well<br>
defended children, and husband of an equally straight shooting lady, I<br>
would like to point out to you the steadily declining rate of homicides<br>
since the passage of the concealed carry law here in florida. I believe the<br>
law was enacted in '87 and the drop in firearm homicides began in '89,<br>
which tells me it took the bad guys a couple of years to catch on to the<br>
fact that we were tired of their shit and shooting back. <br>
<p>
There is no doubt that easier access to firearms will lead to a higher rate<br>
of homicide by individuals who believe that force is the way to improve<br>
their own well being. This phenomenon is observable on a global scale, and<br>
is the reason that I believe that all governments must be disarmed at once.<br>
