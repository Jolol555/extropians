<p>
I think it's more that PSEs using "contemporary" economic theory would be like<br>
NASA using Aristotelian physics.  At the very best it might be like NASA using<br>
Newtonian physics to calculate orbits - a close approximation.<br>
<p>
The PSEs can figure out their own damn economic theory.  *I'm* working on my<br>
program architectures.<br>

<p>
Let me ask the following question:  Do you think that PSEs will be able to<br>
intuitively comprehend general relativity or quantum mechanics?  Perhaps to a<br>
human with a redesigned visual cortex, GR would be "obvious".<br>
<p>
I am bounded on all sides by the processes I can model.  Only the ability to<br>
redesign my brain can break that kind of bound.  Even Einstein could have been<br>
said to be operating on the impetus of the Michelson-Morley experiment, giving<br>
him the needed insight into the unintuitive operating principles of the<br>
Universe - i.e., he "looked in the back of the book" using a physical<br>
experiment.  Maybe we could do that with respect to right and wrong - using<br>
the objective phenomenon of the subjective experience of pleasure - but this<br>
still strikes me as difficult.<br>
<p>
Anyway, given that I don't have cognitive access to X, it seems reasonable to<br>
try and extend my cognitive access before giving up.  It could be that Reality<br>
itself is closed with respect to ethics, but I have absolutely *no* way of<br>
knowing that.  I mean, my theory of ethics is based on being *completely* in<br>
the dark.  Rewiring my cognitive architecture seems like a nice place to start<br>
- even if it doesn't work, I'll be more intelligent when it comes to figuring<br>
out the next attempt.  I can't think of any better way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (This is where Tipler's baroque fantasies of the Omega point lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; me too.  The Omega point looks to me like nothing more or less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the marriage of Heaven and Hell.  Tipler goes on and on about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Heaven part, and never mentions the Hell.)</i><br>
<p>
With all due respect to Tipler, I think the Omega Point is pure trash. <br>
Theology, and not very good theology either.  Although I liked the proof that<br>
an infinite amount of computation can be performed using infinite time and<br>
finite energy or infinite energy and finite time - whether the Universe is<br>
open or closed, in other words.  It might have practical applications.  But<br>
I'm not sure that's original with Tipler.  And aleph-null computations doesn't<br>
necessarily mean you know "everything knowable" - maybe it takes aleph-one. <br>
And the phrase "everything knowable" sounds an awful lot like "the class of<br>
all classes".<br>
