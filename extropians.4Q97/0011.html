To:  Burt's List and Anton Sherwood  &gt;DASher@netcom.com&lt;, who wrote in his<br>
97-09-30 22:13:18 EDT post to list extropians:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You don't like Hayek?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I like him as just much as I like von Mises, Max Weber, Gottfried Dietze,<br>
Richard M Weaver, Russell Kirk, Milton Mayer, Murray N. Rothbard, Milton<br>
Friedman, or Peter Drucker.  Every thing they wrote was interesting,<br>
enlightening, and true.  Every young person should read them, in addition to<br>
many other authors.<br>
<p>
But like the version of Moses described in the The Pentateuch And Haftorahs,<br>
the Douay (Catholic) version, and the King James version of the Bible all<br>
compiled and edited by Ezra the priest with his decree from the King of<br>
Persia to make the priestly establishment (Ezra 7:24) exempt from the first<br>
tithe; these clever fellows from central Europe and their English and<br>
American students told the English and American publics only ten twelfths of<br>
the Law.  The people of Israel never laid eyes on either the first two, or<br>
the second two, tables of the Law (look em up your self, I'm not your<br>
nigger).  That Biblical King of Persia is as responsible for the U.S. tax<br>
code as Moynihan, Dole, and Greenspan.<br>
<p>
All of those intellectually gifted central Europeans preached the free<br>
market, without explaining the technical requirements for creating and<br>
sustaining a free market, which requirements were well defined by Henry<br>
Carter Adams in his 1887 essay RELATION OF THE STATE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION,<br>
reduced to practice by English and American industry ever since, and<br>
confirmed again as recently as 1954 by the "early" Paul A Samuelson; before<br>
he had to choose between continuing an unemployed economist, or, becoming a<br>
wealthy author of the politically correct ECONOMICS, of which I own a ninth<br>
edition together with Stiglitz' The Collected Scientific Papers of P.A.S.,<br>
1966.  Now there's another smart Swede?<br>
<p>
Did Peter Drucker disclose the "concept of a corporation" in his book of that<br>
title?  He did not, and neither did Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. in his 1963 book, MY<br>
YEARS WITH GENERAL MOTERS.  I became acquainted with the "concept of a<br>
corporation or commonwealth" by a fortuitous exposure to General Electric's<br>
1940's decentralization program.  Adam Smith, in 1776, understood the<br>
corporation or commonwealth to be the same concept in his First Maxim of<br>
Taxation.<br>
<p>
Step up to the plate and pitch me another soft ball,<br>
