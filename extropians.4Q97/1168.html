0) I walked into a non destructive transporter.<br>
<p>
1) I walk out of it and look at machine and say: "I am the original"<br>
<p>
2) I walk out of reproducer and look at machine and say: "I am the copy"<br>
<p>
What is the problem?<br>
<p>
Another scenario: <br>
I walk out of reproducer that look outside as a non destructive<br>
transporter and look at machine and say: "I am the original". Then I<br>
see the original and here is discussion:<br>
There ensues discussion about who is original.<br>
Result: I don't know who is original, somebody has cheated somewhere,<br>
but so what. I think that I'm either original or copy and so thinks<br>
that other too.<br>
<p>
Here is another:<br>
What it 'feels' like dying? Okay lets try it. I make a copy myself.<br>
1) I'm listening what my copy says and following brain waves.<br>
2) I'm going to jump into a volcano. I'm going to die but so what.<br>
Original still continues and only thing that is actually lost is more<br>
detailed information about how it feels like dying. I guess that<br>
someday I should make this test make detailed recording about firings<br>
between neural cells. I tell it to original. I'm not actually dying<br>
because I'm not losing memory of past neither future of doing several<br>
things because I'm continuing living in original. It would be<br>
different if this happened year after copying... Know I'm not losing<br>
anything expect I need some energy and material to make another<br>
copy. Im jumping. It's hot...<br>
<p>
Summary:<br>
Hardest thing is to stop associating yourself with your body.  Your<br>
memories and algorithms (thoughts) are kind of immaterial.  For example:<br>
I can express letter 'A' in several ways: Write it into paper. Bits in<br>
computer. Thought in my mind.  So letter 'A' while needing<br>
material/energy to exist is kind of immaterial or independent any<br>
particular material expression.<br>
