<i>&gt; &gt;       I think this forum is an excellent one to discuss the violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; problem.   Violent acts have a great potential to disrupt our visions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the future.  I don't think we can pursue our extropic ideas for long</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; without doing much to solve the violence problem.  We need to consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; why humans are violent.  From there, we can discuss ways of  effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deterring violent behavior.  I think discussing the violence problem will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be more interesting and more productive than  discussing the issue of who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be allowed to possess firearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree completely. As I see it, it can be divided into two main</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems: one is how to decrease the amount of violence in general,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the other is how less-violent groups should deal with violent</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups.</i><br>
<p>
This is an excellent differentiation. Law abiding gun owners typically<br>
focus on the second while anti-gunners are focused on the first and<br>
narrowmindedly see guns as an easy PR pseudo-solution to what seems to<br>
be an intractable human condition. This difference in goals is probably<br>
why the two groups always seem to be talking past each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Violence is an expression of aggression, and deeply ingrained in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental structure. This suggests that we cannot easily get rid of it</i><br>
<i>&gt; without some clever re-structuring of out brains (not something we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to be able to do within close future), although it can likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; be controlled by setting up good mental safeguards (which are of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course fallible, given sufficient irritation) during maturation. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; big question is how to do this well (without stopping other,</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficial behaviors or limiting defense ability), and how to spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful controls among people who have dysfunctional controls.</i><br>
<p>
A couple good reccomendations for producing well adjusted, non-violent<br>
people:<br>
a) require a certificate level license to preproduce<br>
b) make child abuse a corporal crime (not necessarily a death sentence,<br>
but a public whipping or caning would be a good eye for an eye. For<br>
those of you thinking that this may at cross purposes to the goal of<br>
reducing violence, just think about what just the IDEA of publicly<br>
televised canings would do as a deterrent factor. An exection, IMHO is a<br>
poor deterrent, because the offender is not around afterward to live<br>
through the public humiliation.)<br>
c) Outlaw divorce while the children are minors. This would a) ensure<br>
that people thought long and hard about getting married, ensuring that<br>
only those truly commited would do it, and b) eliminate the severe<br>
strife that typically occurs between divorcees, using kids as the pawns,<br>
and c) would eliminate, eventually, families where there is no positive<br>
male role model.<br>
<p>
Don't like any of these? Hey, your dealing with human nature here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The second problem seems to be a variant of the Prisoners dilemma:</i><br>
<i>&gt; mutual defection is much less valuable than mutual cooperation, but a</i><br>
<i>&gt; defector can exploit cooperators. Axelrod's results suggest that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-violent group should adopt a "nice" strategy (no first strike), be</i><br>
<i>&gt; forgiving (do not try to punish competitors too much), provocable</i><br>
<i>&gt; (respond immediately to aggression), avoid envy (focus on increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own absolute fitness rather than their relative fitness compared</i><br>
<i>&gt; to competitors) and be clear (make sure others can interpret their</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On a game theory website I also found the suggestion of attempting to</i><br>
<i>&gt; change the rules so that one avoids getting caught in a prisoners</i><br>
<i>&gt; dilemma. This might occur by becoming immune to attack in some way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for example by being essential for the defectors or moving out to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; different niche (place); do we have any better meta-strategies?</i><br>
<p>
The way to avoid being caught in a prisoners dilemma is to avoid being a<br>
prisoner. Live Free or Die, buddy. The best defense is a good offense.<br>
