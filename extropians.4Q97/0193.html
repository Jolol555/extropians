I'm confused about exactly what Moore's Law states.  From<br>
<a href="http://www.ebtmag.com/issue/9607/07sr5.htm:">http://www.ebtmag.com/issue/9607/07sr5.htm:</a><br>
<p>
   Moore's law, which states that the number of transistors per<br>
   chip doubles every two years,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the Jargon file, e.g.</i><br>
<a href="http://www-sc.ucssc.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/jargon/00000462.html:">http://www-sc.ucssc.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/jargon/00000462.html:</a><br>
<p>
<p>
   Moore's Law: /morz law/ prov. The observation that the logic<br>
   density of silicon integrated circuits has closely followed the<br>
   curve (bits per square inch)  = 2^((t - 1962)) where t<br>
   is time in years; that is, the amount of information storable in<br>
   one square inch of silicon has roughly doubled yearly every year<br>
   since the technology was invented.  See also Parkinson's Law of<br>
   Data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From an article by Gordon Bell,</i><br>
<a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/BARC/GBell/MicroprocessorReport.htm:">http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/BARC/GBell/MicroprocessorReport.htm:</a><br>
<p>
   It is safe to predict the 2047 computers will be at least 100,000 times<br>
   more powerful. If hardware continues to evolve at the annual factor<br>
   of 1.60 rate we know as Moore's Law, (Moore, 1996) then computers that<br>
   are 10 billion times more powerful will exist! Magnetic storage density<br>
   and fiber optic data transmission rates, have evolved at the 60% rate<br>
   (a doubling every 18 months, or 100 times per decade), too.<br>
<p>
So, I have doublings every two years, every year, and every 18 months,<br>
all offered as statement of Moore's Law.<br>
<p>
I suspect Moore originally said doubling either every one or every two<br>
years, and revised this to doubling every 18 months.  But it would be<br>
interesting to know the truth.<br>
