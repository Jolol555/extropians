I have time only to make one point before I have to leave today to teach<br>
all day and evening. I'm puzzled that Arjen has posted several private<br>
mails without, so far as I can tell, having asked the writers' permission.<br>
I'll say no more about that, since it may be that Arjen did in fact ask<br>
permissions to publically post private mail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;However, we realize we are the new ones here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;so we are open for every suggestion you have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, we do give all of you a lot off credit for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;actually building the first structure related to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extropy/transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Never the less, In holland/europe etc.....I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there are more then 100 people who have heard from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you. Correct me if I'm wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Okay: You're off by several orders of magnitude. I have made numerous<br>
appearances on television, in magazines and newspapers, and on radio<br>
explaining transhumanism and the role of Extropy Institute in Europe. I've<br>
appeared on TV in your own country, the Netherlands, and have spoken before<br>
a couple of hundred people in Amsterdam. Aside from the growing number we<br>
are hearing of in Europe via the Net, just this year I have appeared in<br>
major newspapers and magazines in Germany (see a recent issue of c't for<br>
example), as well as the German book Cyberland by Gundolf Freyermuth which<br>
devotes a long chapter based on extropians. While at Ars Electronica in<br>
Austria, I did several interviews for television and newspapers. While in<br>
Madrid, I did interviews for several TV shows, as well as for publications<br>
including El Pais -- the major newspaper based in Madrid. I have explained<br>
extropian ideas in the media in Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria,<br>
Holland, England, and other countries.<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute has been receiving a growing amount of interest from<br>
Europe. That's why we recently set up a European email list. There is also<br>
a feature on European extropians in the Exponent newsletter that's going in<br>
the mail in a few days.<br>
<p>
More later...<br>
