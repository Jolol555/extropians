It seems inconsistent that you would object to Big Brother controlling<br>
your choice to own and use a gun, and yet you cheerfully suggest that<br>
Big Brother control your choice of reproduction, marriage, divorse, and<br>
family role model.  Do you really want someone else to define how a<br>
family should live and then force that definition on you and your<br>
family?<br>
<p>
What if they decide that your gun ownership makes you too dangerous to<br>
reproduce?  What if they consider having guns around your kids to be<br>
child abuse?  What if they decide that a gun owner is not a "positive<br>
male role model".  I can easily see fanatics making all these decisions<br>
in an attempt to reduce violence by following your very own rules stated<br>
above.<br>
