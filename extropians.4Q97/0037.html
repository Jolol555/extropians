At 11:58 AM 9/30/97 -0400, Darrell wrote stuff.<br>
<p>
I read your post with initial disappointment that turned around as I went<br>
on.  I wish you'd sorted out the logic before posting.  You start by making<br>
the oft-heard but absurd claim<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Unfortunately, the selection pressure towards indefinate longevity is</i><br>
<i>&gt;very weak. [...] once an organism has finished breeding and rearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;children there is no particular evolutionary advantage in living much</i><br>
<i>&gt;longer</i><br>
<p>
We've been down this track before.  You're assuming part of what needs to<br>
be demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding<br>
reliably.  That's contingently true of complex critters, as it happens, but<br>
what we need to ask is why it should be so.  (In other words, it is<br>
logically possible that an endlessly healthy, self-repairing and fertile<br>
couple could production-line their joint genes until the end of time, with<br>
a superior inclusive fitness function for their very own selfish genes than<br>
their watered-down cousin gene pool.  Both Darwin and Mendel would rub<br>
their hands with glee without a single censorious word of reproof.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Also keep in mind that in the past many more people did not survive to</i><br>
<i>&gt;full maturity.  Any genetic trait that exchanges robustness in youth for</i><br>
<i>&gt;more problems in old age would be favored.</i><br>
<p>
Closer to making sense.  This again, however, tends to assume what needs to<br>
be shown.  What are the characteristics that keep you fighting fit as a<br>
rug-rat, a child, an adolescent and a young parent but go on to sap your<br>
reproductive health in later years?  Having a good immune system, once it's<br>
been primed, should give you a snappy start in life, but surely should also<br>
*continue* as a benefit.  (On the other hand, we set out with a limited if<br>
Vast immunity repertoire, and the little bastards who breed in us keep<br>
changing their formula, so the simple passage of time might be enough to<br>
make oldsters vulnerable to Widowmaker '99 - but that doesn't explain these<br>
ugly crowsfeet and those hot flushes.)  Certain specific trade-offs have<br>
been suggested by experts such as George Williams, but the devil is in the<br>
details.  Hand-waving can support either tendency, I think.  <br>
<p>
Note that this hangs on the assumption that some metabolic mechanisms<br>
especially beneficial to the infant, say, will turn and bite later on.  I<br>
dunno - maybe if you're a chubby cholesterol-rich kid you do better than<br>
the lean and hungry look, and then the arterial accumulation knocks you off<br>
after 50 fertile years.  But we know there are snazzy mechanisms for<br>
healing sick DNA and other damage - a different point, granted - because<br>
our gonadal DNA is 3 billion years old and not a day the worse for it (same<br>
homeobox sequences, often enough - highly conservative).  Aside from those<br>
pesky risks to purity of essence, to wit--<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The first place that cell damage will cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;serious problems is when damaged sperm or eggs pass their inheritence to</i><br>
<i>&gt;an embryo.  This is why woman over 40 having children have a much higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;risk of having babies with Down's Syndrome.  A Down's baby is</i><br>
<i>&gt;reproductively speaking an enormous waste of energy, especially when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes to caring for it after it is born.</i><br>
<p>
Well... okay, that makes sense - but is exposure to free radicals and<br>
cosmic rays and really bad television programs for 40 years so much more<br>
damaging, even lethal, than for 20 years?  My hunch is that the machinery<br>
for keeping gonadal DNA clean and shiny is specialised and too expensive to<br>
share around generally, and that some suboptimal babies are not due to<br>
damaged ova but to clapped out Mommies and their poorly maintained<br>
life-support system innards.  True, Down syndrome is a specific<br>
embryological glitch, an extra somatic chromosome acquired during meiosis,<br>
but might Down births be due not so much to an excess of these foetuses<br>
from older mothers and maybe fathers as to a breakdown in the standard<br>
flushout mechanism for teratological deviations?  (Any experts out there?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	To get superlongevity we'll have to bootstrap and cast away our</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic history. </i><br>
<p>
Surely.  It will presumably require - at least in the short term - the<br>
physical introduction of cleaners and sweepers at the nano scale, getting<br>
their purity guarantees and power supply from outside the body, from<br>
culturgens rather than  directly from genes.  Works with memes, sort of.  <br>
