<i>&gt; &gt;The current issue of Skeptic magazine (Vol. 5 No. 3) has an article by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Derek Freeman about Margaret Mead.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The problem with this cite is its partiality.  As I understand it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Freeman's standing is hardly secure.  He might well be correct - I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of sympathy for his analysis - but I'd like to see an array of</i><br>
<i>&gt; commentary from several sides of the controversy, not just Freeman</i><br>
<i>&gt; repeating himself.  Incidentally, the noted Australian playwright David</i><br>
<i>&gt; Williamson recently had some success with THE HERETIC, a stage</i><br>
<i>&gt; dramatisation of the Mead-Freeman scandal (which has Freeman's imprimatur).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Williamson, formerly a sardonic but engaged chronicler of the left, has</i><br>
<i>&gt; lately been adopting a different position, with plays dealing with</i><br>
<i>&gt; malicious and deceitful claims of sexual harassment by a young female</i><br>
<i>&gt; student against her male university teacher, and the supposed failures of</i><br>
<i>&gt; `multiculturalism' and attacks on the English literature canon by evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; postmodernists.</i><br>

For another perspective on this issue, you might read "The History of Samoan Sexual <br>
Conduct and the Mead-Freeman Controversy" in the "American Anthropologist" (98:555-567).<br>
Interestingly, Freeman's response to the article was not published by the magazine. Not <br>
a good sign if you think the Mead defenders are interested in real scientific debate and <br>
not just preaching to the choir. <br>
