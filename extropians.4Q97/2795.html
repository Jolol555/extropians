<p>
Who are some of these archaeologists?  From what I understand of Mayan<br>
studies, the field was long dominated by a pair named Sylvanus Morley and<br>
Eric Thompson, both of whom painted the Maya as basically a bunch of High<br>
Church Anglicans, remarkably like the scholars themselves!<br>
<p>
Thompson held up the decipherment of the Maya script for *decades* largely<br>
because Yuri Knosorov, the philologist who came up with a fruitful<br>
methodolgy for deciphering, was a Soviet citizen and therefore evil,<br>
foolish, and unscientific.  As more and more Mayanists used Knosorov's<br>
methods and the "semeisiographic wisdom" of the ruins turned out to<br>
describe wars, king lists, and other distinctly non-mystical<br>
preoccupations, the image of Maya civilization as a peaceful, communal<br>
*theocracy* died out.<br>
