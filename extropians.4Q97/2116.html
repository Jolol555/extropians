<i>&gt; There is a demand for this list, and so in principle there is an opportunity</i><br>
<i>&gt; to "tax" list members to pay for "good things" done by ExI.  But it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; that hard to create competing mailing lists, so I don't think the tax </i><br>
<i>&gt; could be very high.  Requiring ExI membership at $95/yr seems far too high.</i><br>
<p>
List maintenance isn't the product we'd be taxing.  That's cheap<br>
indeed--I could create a list tonight for nothing.  I already manage<br>
four and have plenty of server space.  But nobody would care.  The<br>
product in demand is the time and attention of a few people--Max,<br>
Natasha, you, Anders, Carl, and a few others.  Whither /they/ go,<br>
so shall we follow.  If a free list is added as well, that's fine,<br>
but if those people don't follow it, it will be as useless as the<br>
alt.extropians group is now.<br>
<p>
The other product of course is the "extropy.org" trademark.  No<br>
matter how valuable any lists become, the ones pointed to from the<br>
ExI site will be seen--rightly or wrongly--as having the implicit<br>
sanction of ExI, and will therefore attract more interest.<br>
<p>
Both of those products are so many times more valuable than mere<br>
list maintenance that they alone will determine what price the<br>
market will bear.<br>
<p>
I would even go so far as to say that it would be such a great<br>
benefit to have just a few valuable people that ExI could charge<br>
more for membership to have money to pay certain people to read<br>
and occasionally contribute to the list.  David Friedman, for<br>
example, is a nethead but doesn't have time for all of this list.<br>
If ExI paid someone to digest the political/economic discussion,<br>
forward it to him, and get responses, I'd be happy to pay more<br>
for that.  Perhaps some similar arrangement could be made with<br>
folks like Drexler, Merkle, etc.<br>
