<p>
It is simple, you have made the mistake of mixing up the section<br>
dealing with a closed universe (which is finite) and the section<br>
dealing with an open universe (which is infinite). Read the original<br>
post more closely (somehow I don't think you will bother).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My hope is that you will research Objectivist Epistemology and</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognize it as a powerful immune system for your brain and implement it</i><br>
<i>&gt; so you can go on to apply your admirable mental capacity to challenges that</i><br>
<i>&gt; will increase your happiness(and of course my selfish reasons are to benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the products or services of a happy, rational person that will be so</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable in a free society--should we ever see a free society on earth.)</i><br>
<p>
Actually, my research into memetics and philosophy, as well as<br>
discussions with other objectivists including you, have convinced me<br>
firmly that objectivism (as understood by many of its adherents) is a<br>
very bad immune system given my personal goals of growth and<br>
openness. Can't you see that you have closed your own mind much more<br>
firmly than the closed universes you refuse to believe in? Essentially<br>
you are subscribing to a self-supporting, doubtless comfortable, meme<br>
complex that tells you that you are right, everybody else who does not<br>
share your opinion is wrong, and that you must at every chance<br>
proselytize. It is extremely similar to the Jehova's Witnesses meme.<br>
