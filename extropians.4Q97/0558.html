Not necessary. I've been involved with a variety of animals in my life,<br>
including personally training dozens of dogs and a few horses. Not once have<br>
I witnessed any animal choosing to set aside instinct. Indeed, it is appeal<br>
to these very instincts that an animal is trained.<br>
<p>
When you say "effect of instinct can be overidden", I must ask, overidden by<br>
what or whom? Can an infant animal, human or otherwise, choose to overide<br>
the instinct to nurse? Can a dog choose to dismiss survival instinct and<br>
commit suicide? Granted, one can cruely choose to mentally condition an<br>
animal to avoid survival necessities (ironically by relating to survival<br>
instinct); or one can choose to  kill the animal and "overide" the survival<br>
instincts, but the animal makes no such choice, for by nature it has no such<br>
capacity; which is why the directives are call instincts. <br>

<i>&gt;&gt;The question to be answered is: Does a term, and definition of it, describe</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;consciously claiming they can create objective reality by words; yet this</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I not only consider my paragraph relevant, but of core principle relevancy<br>
in reference to the relationship of word usage and fact. In my book, nothing<br>
gets any more relevant than this whatever the topic and issue under<br>
discussion.  Your arbitrary dismisal as irrelevant without effort to explain<br>
what about it is irrelevant and why doesn't really enlignten me much about<br>
the alleged error. Suppose I go down the line and mark all your agruments as<br>
irrelevant without explanation, thus leaving only my position to consider,<br>
what would be your response to such an action?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's observe infant animals, human and otherwise, that survive without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;conscious effort of plan of action.  Choice plays no part in it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reactive entity has no choice. Neither your choice nor mine can change this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;natural circumstance. The urges that direct the survival reactions are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;inherent in the entities. It is fact that there is no choice in the matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;To this natural condition, we apply the term, instinct. Ergo, the term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;instinct, by definition, excludes choice. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Overriding does not alter, nor eliminate instinct. Choice has nothing to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the definition of instinct, one way or the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Volition has nothing to do with the definition of instinct, one way or the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other. You seek to define instinct by its effects (in specific instances),</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than by its true nature.</i><br>
<p>
Take another look. Instinct is defined as non volitional reaction in ALL<br>
instances. That's what gives the term, instinct, definitive meaning. If this<br>
definition is not the "true nature" of instinct, what is? By what objective<br>
reference and rationale do you establish and hold this conclusion? It<br>
appears that you are saying that every urge is an instinctive urge. The<br>
instinctive part is not the urge itself, but whether the urge directs non<br>
volitional reaction, or whether the effect of the urge is subject to<br>
volition. Isn't this really the case and what really differentiates<br>
instinctive from non instinctive? If differentiation is not a principle of<br>
actual definition, why is there more than one word in a language system?<br>
To be sure, if you feel the need, you can arbitrarily call all urges<br>
instinctive to support the belief, "instinctive objective values" if you<br>
wish, but it disregards the objective differention that actually exists. <br>
<p>
The definition I gave of the term, instinct, which excluded volition, is<br>
consistent with the principles I explained as required for actual<br>
definition. You did not challenge this criteria, but simply dismissed it out<br>
of hand with the word, "irrelevant". You have aroused my curiousity. Do you<br>
see any need to connect your word arrangements to objective reality? If not,<br>
why not? If so, by what reference criteria do you presume to do so?<br>
