Ok, there are 2 entangled photons, one headed toward me and the other one <br>
headed toward you a billion light years away. We previously agreed that if a <br>
photon makes it through your polarizer, set at 0 degrees, that means I'm <br>
telling you to attack by land, if the photon doesn't make it through your<br>
detector that means attack by sea. A billion years after we separate I decide <br>
you should attack by sea, so I set my polarizer at 90 degrees. If my <br>
entangled photon gets through my polarizer at 90 degrees then there is a zero <br>
probability that your photon will get though your polarizer at 0 degrees, <br>
so I've sent a message to attack by sea and done it much faster than light <br>
and everybody's happy. There is just one problem, how can I make sure that my <br>
indeterminate entangled photon does in fact get through my detector when I<br>
set it at 90 degrees?<br>
       <br>
When a photon of indeterminate polarization arrives there is always a 50%  <br>
probability it will get through, regardless of the direction I set my <br>
polarizer at, there is just no way around it. If my photon is absorbed by my <br>
polarizer set at 90 degrees, and there is a 50% chance it will be, then there <br>
is a 100% probability your photon will be transmitted through your polarizer <br>
set at 0 degrees, and that would give you the erroneous message to attack by <br>
land. Flipping a coin would work just as well for you, and it would be a lot <br>
easier.<br>
