Here's a relevant bit from THE SPIKE (pp. 37-8):<br>
<p>
============================================<br>
<p>
Today's cutting-edge components are not just small, they are very, very<br>
small.  Sooner or later, one is bound to run out of profitably accessible<br>
space, down there on the etched circuits.  Even if there's ample unused<br>
room at the nano level, will we be able to push the atoms around quickly<br>
enough, and cheaply enough, to continue our dizzying plunge downward into<br>
micro- and nano-chip utopia, and upward toward the Spike?<br>
<p>
Certainly, Hans Moravec assured me.  Relax.  `The engineers directly<br>
involved in making ICs [integrated circuits] tend to be pessimistic about<br>
future progress, because they can see all the problems with the current<br>
approaches, but are too busy to pay much attention to the far-out<br>
alternatives in the research labs.  As long as the conventional approaches<br>
continue to be improved, the radical alternatives don't have a competitive<br>
chance.  But, as soon as progress in conventional techniques falters,<br>
radical alternatives jump ahead, and start a new cycle of refinement.  When<br>
short wavelength ultraviolet is no longer good enough, there are X-ray<br>
synchrotrons, electron-beams and even scanning tunnelling microscopes.<br>
Existing ICs are still so far from the 3D, quantum electronic possibilities<br>
already demonstrated in the lab, and the economic incentives to keep the<br>
race going are so huge, that I see no reason to expect things to start to<br>
slow down for several decades - and then we have a whole new regime, that<br>
will make our current time look like the Stone Age.  (And if chip plants<br>
cost ten billion dollars, well, that's partly because they have to be so<br>
big to make the quantities that the market demands.)'<br>
		<br>
The latest news from Moravec is even more astonishing.  By 1997, according<br>
to his analysis of computational bang for your buck, the Moore's Law curve<br>
returned to its original doubling-every-year, and has now swept onward into<br>
even swifter acceleration.  He comments:  `By 1993 personal computers<br>
provided 10 MIPS (million instructions per second), by 1995 it was 30 MIPS,<br>
and in 1997 it is over 100 MIPS.  Suddenly machines are reading text,<br>
recognizing speech, and robots are driving themselves cross-country.'<br>
<p>
================================================<br>
<p>
Every curve saturates.  Will new curves emerge (or be pushed) to take up<br>
the slack?  Seems plausible to me.<br>
