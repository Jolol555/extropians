Lee Daniel Crocker, in his last posting, clarifies his thoughts on <br>
the dynamics of the spectrum of violent&lt;---&gt;nonviolent alternatives <br>
to defense against violent attacks, and the prevention thereof.  I <br>
find myself in agreement with most of his comments, except for when <br>
he seems to slip into the underlying assumption that one must choose <br>
definitively between a violent or a nonviolent set of options.  I <br>
tend to approach this with more of a sliding scale, with a commitment <br>
to explore less deadly options first, but accepting deadly force as a <br>
necessary thing in some cases, and with a full awareness of the <br>
gravity of that course of action.  <br>
<p>
Or, in the more poetic words of Lao Tzu (as translated by Stephen <br>
Mitchell):  <br>
	Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them<br>
	except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them<br>
	only with the utmost restraint...His enemies are not demons, but <br>
	humans like himself.  He doesn't wish them personal harm.  Nor <br>
	does he rejoice in victory...He enters a battle gravely, with <br>
	sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral.<br>
<p>
David Musick's posting on self-defense, as well as a few of the<br>
follow-up postings, apply this scale on a personal level.  <br>
<p>
Of course, our highest goal would be to avoid the necessity of having to <br>
engage in physical or armed conflict altogether.  It is eminently <br>
possible for every human to develop a skill base that will enable <br>
each person to determine when something is going wrong.  We still <br>
carry those instincts from our ancient beginnings, and we must learn <br>
to trust them to tell us when danger is imminent, so that we can <br>
remove ourselves from the situation or warn others.  This set of <br>
skills can operate on a personal level or on a national level, as <br>
Chung-ho chi wrote centuries ago: <br>
<p>
	Deep knowledge is to be aware of disturbance before <br>
	disturbance, to be aware of danger before danger, to be<br>
	aware of destruction before destruction, to be aware of<br>
	calamity before calamity.  Strong action is training the<br>
	body without being burdened by the body, exercising the<br>
	mind without being used by the mind...By deep knowledge of <br>
	principle, one can change disturbance into order, change <br>
	danger into safety, change calamity into fortune.<br>
<p>
However flawed our present system of conducting international<br>
affairs, if you take the broad view from the beginnings of our<br>
history, humans are on the course of developing more effective<br>
preventative measures that continue to reduce the occurrences of war<br>
globally.  In keeping with this broader view, I direct your attention<br>
to a poem by Eon currently in residence on Natasha's Transhumanist<br>
Art site (<a href="http://www.extropic-art.com/gallery.htm">http://www.extropic-art.com/gallery.htm</a>), called<br>
'posthuman germinate'.  It is a sort of past-future history of<br>
human.  The first stanza highlights the limited scope of our<br>
relations and perceptions at the beginning of our history:<br>
<p>
	In the beginning was man and the creature gods<br>
	who dominate at the will of the slave.<br>
	Drumbeat on the horizon announces intention<br>
	while eyes shift from spear to shield<br>
	for trade or war, no other use known <br>
	<br>
