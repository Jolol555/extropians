<p>
I spent a while looking into this last year, and, as is my wont, never<br>
wrote anything down.  Let's see what I can remember... <br>
<p>
There are walls between the bubbles, whose thickness is small compared to<br>
the size of the bubbles.  This is inconsistent with the notion that life<br>
originated at random times and places and spreads spherically, since in<br>
that case we would observe that some bubbles had run into each other, while<br>
others were small and in the middle of large 'uncolonized' areas.  However,<br>
if civilizations for some reason like to leave 'neutral zones' between<br>
them, then this would explain the observed pattern.  In this case, we are<br>
in a neutral zone, and can expect to be swatted down as soon as we become<br>
politically unacceptable (:-).<br>
<p>
The bubbles are not completely empty.  The contain the occasional galaxy.<br>
This is a small problem for the theory.<br>
<p>
The stars in the dark zones cannot simply have been Dysoned, since their<br>
waste heat would be clearly visible to some kind of telescope, regardless<br>
of its temperature.  The bubbles contain 90% of the volume of the universe,<br>
so if the universe was uniform, 90% of the stars would have been Dysoned.<br>
Alas, the spectral region between 10 microns and 1000 microns (300K to 3K)<br>
where the Dyson spheres would radiate does not contain 10 times as much<br>
light as is emitted by all visible stars.  Also, the bubbles should be<br>
visible as large infrared blobs, and they're not.  <br>
<p>
If the Dyson sphere heat radiators are built of solid hydrogen, they could<br>
be big enough to actually be opaque on a galctic scale, and would have a<br>
radiation temperature on the order of 5K, which would be close to a<br>
thermodynamic optimum.  Unfortunately, the bubbles would have clearly<br>
visible effects on the cosmic background radiation.<br>
<p>
If the civilizations that built the bubbles wanted to conserve energy for<br>
the longest possible time, they might have modified the stars in their<br>
domains to make them burn more slowly.  In this case, the objections of the<br>
previous two paragraphs vanish.<br>
<p>
If a civilization is expanding at a speed comparable to that of light, we<br>
would see their frontier as an ellipsoid rather than as a sphere.  The long<br>
axis of the ellipsoid would be pointed toward us, and the closer the<br>
conquest velocity was to lightspeed, the more elongated the ellipsoid.<br>
This isn't really an issue, since the 'neutral zone' hypothesis requires<br>
that all expansion was complete a long time ago.<br>
