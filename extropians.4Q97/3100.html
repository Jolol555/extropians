<p>
An adjustment in one's thinking and reactions to being "exposed" would<br>
deemphasize the affects of disclosure on one's privacy.  The longer we live,<br>
the less affected we are by the consequences of our behavior -- in part due<br>
to the fading of memory and also, and importantly, due to the gains in<br>
wisdom from life experiences.<br>
<p>
Historical recordations might rely on computers rather than author or actor<br>
for information gathering.  Certainly, there could be on/off switches<br>
editing out crucial facts, but will we care to edit events out when we<br>
become more confident about our actions and less embarrassed by our pasts? <br>
<p>
The methodology of  historical research and presentation itself may change.<br>
When time is not categorized by events such as wars or disease, it will be<br>
recorded by other types of events -- the events of merit in our posthuman years.<br>
<p>
Time itself will become abstracted. Our minds tend to still frames of our<br>
own historical importance in our memories - one to the next - just as the<br>
news broadcasts leading stories.  Our emotions are tied into these images<br>
very tightly.  As we live longer and longer, we will have less and less need<br>
to be emotionally tied to our own leading stories.  We may begin to enjoy<br>
the pauses inbetween.  These pauses might become years and even centuries of<br>
living with no featured "historical event" occurring.  (Much like working in<br>
the garden, absorbed in the act of life.)  Events such as reaching another<br>
galaxy or designing a new species might be historical events to be recorded,<br>
and perhaps the technology producing the events might be the author also.<br>
<p>
I do think that immortality will affect historiography. I don't think that<br>
immortality will necessarily restrict historiography.  I do think that<br>
immortality may change our approach to it.<br>
