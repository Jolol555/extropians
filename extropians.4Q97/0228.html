<i>&gt; Which simply illustrates the unexpected benefits which may come from</i><br>
<i>&gt; diversity, and perhaps cautions us against hasty standardization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mnemosyne and Qwerty help us if the world had quickly adopted Chinese</i><br>
<i>&gt; logographs.</i><br>
<p>
Frankly, I think Chinese logographs would have served us well.  It is<br>
actually a much more efficient system for printing, reading, and even<br>
writing: there are, on average, fewer penstrokes per Chinese word<br>
than per English word.  They also survive the centuries better, not<br>
being subject to phonetic drift (peasants from opposite sides of China<br>
who would strain to understand each other's speech--if they could<br>
manage at all--can both read Lau-Tsu with ease, while students today<br>
have difficulty with Shakespeare, and most don't even attempt Chaucer).<br>
<p>
The only disadvantage to logographs is longer learning time.  I think<br>
that's a minor nuisance, really, for all its benefits.  In the computer<br>
age, storage would be more efficient, but a manual input device would<br>
be trickier, so that's a downside I suppose.  We might have been forced<br>
to develop higher-resolution displays sooner, too!<br>
