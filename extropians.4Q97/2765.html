<i>&gt;30's, where socialist/communist sympathizing archaeologists from British</i><br>
<i>&gt;and American Ivy League schools developed the preposterous and</i><br>

<i>&gt;innocent heathens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As it turns out, nothing could have been further from the truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Following a successful harvest, the preist/god/king typically had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;ceremony in which he sought the advice of the gods/ancestors, etc. by</i><br>
<i>&gt;piercing his penis with a series of sharpened splinters from different</i><br>
<i>&gt;trees. The pattern of splattered blood that formed supposedly told him</i><br>

<i>&gt;gave him the illusion he was talking to the gods. In any event, the</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
There is also the famous case of Margaret Mead more or less making up a<br>
whole load of shit that influenced (especially leftist) sociology for<br>
years in her book "Coming of Age in Samoa".<br>
<p>
She painted a picture of Samoans as Noble Savages, the whole shebang<br>
(especially in regard to sexual freedom); actually, Samoans are if<br>
anything even *more* taboo-ridden than we are.  <br>
<p>
Recently, one of her then-adolescent informers (now a grand dame in<br>
Samoan society) owned up to having teased Mead a *lot* in the course of<br>
her researches for the book!<br>
<p>
(Sorry I can't remember references, but it's quite a well known case in<br>
sociology.)<br>
