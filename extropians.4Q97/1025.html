Since certain drugs might help us improve ourselves (or others, curing<br>
mental illnesses for example), I believe this is a good place to tell<br>
you about them (I just told them about Extropy and received some<br>
positive feedback), I've been on that list for about a month and would<br>
say it's quite "scientific" (but "amateur" posts are also welcome)...<br>

ANNOUNCING MAPS-FORUM<br>
<p>
The MAPS forum is the electronic discussion group of the<br>
Multidisciplinary<br>
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). MAPS is a 501 (c) (3)<br>
corporation chartered in 1986 as a membership-based research and<br>
educational organization. Currently numbering 1400 members, MAPS focuses<br>
on the development of beneficial, socially-sanctioned uses of<br>
psychedelic<br>
drugs and marijuana. MAPS pursues its mission by helping scientific<br>
researchers design, obtain governmental approval for, fund, conduct and<br>
report on psychedelic research in human volunteers. <br>
<p>
The MAPS forum supports this mission by allowing members to interact<br>
with<br>
each other and with international experts in the psychedelic field.<br>
Topics<br>
may include current news, book reviews, factual questions about<br>
psychedelics or marijuana, psychedelics and marijuana in the media,<br>
ideas<br>
for research and fundraising, and articles in the MAPS quarterly<br>
bulletin/newsletter. Students who have written class papers on<br>
psychedelic<br>
topics are encouraged to share their work here. M.D. and Ph.D. <br>
researchers funded by MAPS are also asked to participate. The forum also<br>
serves as a rapid response network when there are opportunities to<br>
influence drug policy decisions that are critical to MAPS' mission. <br>
Questions about anything MAPS is doing, or suggestions for anything MAPS<br>
should be doing, are encouraged. <br>
<p>
To maintain the high standards that members expect from MAPS, this is a<br>
moderated list. Subscribers to maps-forum are assured of a high<br>
signal/noise ratio. A maximum of five messages are selected for posting<br>
to<br>
the list each day by the moderator. Although questions are welcome at<br>
all<br>
levels of interest, the moderator prefers posted comments to be<br>
presented<br>
at a level appropriate for a classroom or a professional meeting. <br>
<p>
To subscribe to maps-forum, send email to majordomo@maps.org with<br>
"subscribe maps-forum Albert Hofmann &lt;youraddress&gt;" (if your name is<br>
Albert Hofmann) without the quotes, in the first line. Make sure<br>
youraddress is enclosed within the &lt;brackets&gt; as shown. Leave the<br>
subject<br>
line and all other lines blank. To unsubscribe, send email to<br>
majordomo@maps.org with "unsubscribe maps-forum youraddress", without<br>
the<br>
quotes, in the first line. Leave the subject line and all other lines<br>
blank.<br>
<p>
Subscriptions to maps-forum are free to MAPS members, and free to<br>
non-members for a 90-day trial period. Memberships, which include a<br>
subscription to the quarterly MAPS Bulletin, are available for<br>
$35 (non-US: $50) for General Members, and $20 (non-US: $35) for<br>
student/low income.<br>

Albert Einstein wrote that "Imagination is more important than<br>
knowledge." <br>
If you can even faintly imagine a cultural reintegration of the use of<br>
psychedelics and the states of mind they engender, please consider<br>
joining<br>
MAPS in supporting the expansion of scientific knowledge in this area. <br>
Progress is possible with the support of individuals who care enough to<br>
take individual and collective action. <br>

GUIDELINES FOR AUTHORS<br>
(1) Questions are welcome at all levels of interest but posted comments<br>
should be presented at a level appropriate for a classroom or a<br>
professional meeting. Primarily, this means to assume a skeptical<br>
audience. Make an effort to support your assertions with argumentation<br>
and<br>
evidence. Clearly state the central point you are trying to make early<br>
in<br>
your message. Provide definitions and/or examples when using unusual<br>
terminology or advanced concepts. Make references to the literature<br>
and/or<br>
URL's whenever possible. <br>
<p>
(2) By the same token, please provide an introduction, summary, or<br>
discussion of all references or URL's posted to the list. Don't just<br>
post<br>
web addresses and say, "check this out." <br>
<p>
(3) A maximum of five messages will be selected for posting to the list<br>
each day. Short posts are prefered over longer posts. Consider breaking<br>
up<br>
longer works into a series of installments over a week or several weeks.<br>
If you have already received five messages from the forum in the past 24<br>
hours, please wait until the next day to post. <br>
<p>
(4) Persons who have not submitted recently will be given priority over <br>
those who post to the list often. In general, it is prefered that <br>
individual subscribers post no more often than once per week and only<br>
once <br>
or twice per thread (although there are numerous exceptions). Consider <br>
whether your response to a post is better sent to the author rather than <br>
to the entire list.<br>
<p>
(5) For purposes of legal safety, first person narratives confessing<br>
one's<br>
own illegal drug use are always sent back to the author with a reminder<br>
of<br>
this guideline.<br>
<p>
(6) Relevant cross-posts from other sources are welcome (especially when<br>
an introduction explaining the relevance is included), but original<br>
content is prefered. <br>
<p>
(7) General drug policy discussions (prohibition vs. legalization) are<br>
not encouraged unless they specifically relate to research. Examples of<br>
acceptable drug policy topics include: the influence of drug policy on<br>
research, or the policy implications of research.<br>
<p>
(8) When responding to a post on the list, *briefly* quote only the<br>
relevant part of what you are specifically responding to, and write your<br>
message under the quote.<br>
