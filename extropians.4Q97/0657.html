Apart from that, transplanting your brain is only useful if you're not too<br>
old, and have a healthy brain. The elderly, people with brain tumors,<br>
Altzheimer's and the like wouldn't be helped much by brain transplants.<br>
If such transplants became standard, the no 1 killers would be strokes<br>
and cancers/degenerative diseases in the brain (instead of heart attacks<br>
lung cancer and the like). <br>
<p>
Then again, the technology needed to perform a brain transplant<br>
could probably also cure at least *some* of the (brain)diseases mentioned<br>
above. Any doctor in the house to verify this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another downside is the need to wait 18</i><br>

<i>&gt; reasonable form of physical maturity.  </i><br>
I've once heard on some Discovery Channel program that you could<br>
grow (human) tissues at an astronomical rate under the right conditions.<br>
A small patch of cells could fill the floor of a football stadium in a<br>
matter<br>
of weeks or so, if cultivated under the right conditions. At least _some_<br>
organs could be grown in vitro on a skeleton of some kind of stuff that<br>
dissolves with time, maybe even whole bodies. This would only take <br>
a month or so(?).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't know about the rest of</i><br>
<i>&gt; you, but even if it were possible to cram an adult human brain into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; three year old body, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun.</i><br>
Hey, you could have a body the size of a football field, if so desired.<br>
How's that for fun ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Talk about an industry, though-- the care and feeding of decerebrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; clones.  How much per day do you figure it would cost to care for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decerebrated clone?  To make sure it is properly fed by whatever &gt;means?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can't have a clone come out of the tank malnourished.  </i><br>
The in vitro fluid is also the cells' optimal food, this is not a problem.<br>
In later stages this fluid (or something better?) could be circulated <br>
through the body via an artificial umbilical cord (attached to the belly, <br>
not the neck like in _Space, above and beyond_)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To make sure it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is exercised by some means?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't want an emaciated, atrophied clone</i><br>
<i>&gt; stumbling out of the tank.</i><br>
You could pump up the clones' body with stereoids of some kind, and/<br>
or exercise muscle groups with electric currents. That should do it.<br>
