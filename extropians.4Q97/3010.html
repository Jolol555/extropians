<i>&gt; Agreed, which is why it would be nice to have a model of what is going on</i><br>

<p>
Yes, that would be helpful. But simulating the interactions between<br>
arbitrary cps and a more or less living tissue is a *heavy*<br>
problem. Of course, some approximations could be done (such as a<br>
simple phenomenological model of crystal formation depending on some<br>
properties of the cps), and then more detailled studies could be done<br>
with the successful combinations, but I guess there will be a lot of<br>
both beneficial and problematic interactions that are very hard to<br>
deal with using general rules (cp X forms a complex with cp Y that<br>
limits perfusion, cp X, Y and Z appears to be very bad in simulations<br>
but due to serpendipity they interact with some body-chemicals to form<br>
a very good cryoprotectant solution).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 		Perhaps different cps should be used for different </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 			tissues?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Problem: how do you get them there?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It might be possible that some cps flow into tissue at different rates, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which case, a cp cocktail might be made which can be administered</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the same way current ones are.</i><br>
<p>
One could also look at cps or additives that bind more or less<br>
strongly to certain tissues, "opening" or "closing" them for each<br>
other. Sounds complex but interesting (maybe something that opens the<br>
blood brain barrier first?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps a multistage process might be used in which blood is removed</i><br>
<i>&gt; and cps are injected into the tissues rather than through the main</i><br>
<i>&gt; circulatory system.</i><br>
<p>
It is hard to get better access than the circulatory system - it is a<br>
spacefilling fractal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Stanislaw Lem's novel _Fiasco_ has cryonic suspension units inside</i><br>
<i>&gt; walkers on Titan, so that if the pilots of the walker wind up in a pinch,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they can suspend themselves.  Early in the novel, there is no way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; revive people, but later on a means develops and one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserved persons is revived.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is a quite reasonable idea with emergency vitrification. A bit<br>
like an airbag...<br>
