On Thu, 30 Oct 1997 I incorrectly suggested that<br>
Robin Hanson once said something to the effect that<br>
economists don't study non-linear models.  And Robin<br>
naturally replied:<br>
<p>
&lt; I have no recollection or record of saying this,<br>
and economic models are most certainly "non-linear". &gt;<br>
<p>
VERY SORRY; I should have been more discriminating<br>
before making such a silly statement!<br>
<p>
The thread was "Great Filter, Low Profile,<br>
Cryptocosmology" and I asked "What would economists<br>
call the type of mechanisms (for trying to modulate<br>
chaotic systems, rather than eliminate them)", trying<br>
to get some idea of the scope of what Robin meant by<br>
"Mechanism Design" and "signaling games" and whether<br>
these had any application to chaotic systems.<br>
<p>
On Tuesday, October 22, 1996 1:31 PM Robin Hanson<br>
replied:<br>
&lt; Economists don't focus much on systems described by<br>
differential equations in time.  So they don't have a<br>
snappy name for it. &gt;<br>
<p>
Now, if I was a Fortune 500 executive and you were<br>
briefing me and said something like that, I would<br>
probably send you back to your campus and go hire<br>
someone like Michael Rothschild who could speak my<br>
language (of course, I'd likely be making a big<br>
mistake ;-)<br>
<p>
This relates to another thread, that I noticed while<br>
digging up the above reference, where Robin was<br>
wondering why people accept advice from computer<br>
salespeople but not from economists or other social<br>
scientists.<br>
<p>
I mentioned Paul Romer's New Growth theories and<br>
Robin replied:<br>
&lt; Romer's work is solidly within the standard <br>
"equilibrium thinking" framework.  (In economics, <br>
equilibrium doesn't mean statis.) &gt;<br>
<p>
I'm sure it is, and ideas of endogenous growth<br>
complement Krugman's work on 'free trade'.<br>
<p>
I guess, then, that most political scientists today<br>
would not agree with the concluding paragraph of<br>
Friedrich Hayek's 1945 essay "The Use of Knowledge in<br>
Society" where he warns:<br>
<p>
"Any approach, such as that of much of mathematical<br>
economics with its simultaneous equations, which in<br>
effect starts from the assumption that people's<br>
knowledge corresponds with the objective facts of the<br>
situation, systematically leaves out what is our main<br>
task to explain. I am far from denying that in our<br>
system equilibrium analysis has a useful function to<br>
perform. But when it comes to the point where it<br>
misleads some of our leading thinkers into believing<br>
that the situation which it describes has direct<br>
relevance to the solution of practical problems, it<br>
is high time that we remember that it does not deal<br>
with the social process at all and that it is no more<br>
than a useful preliminary to the study of the main<br>
problem."<br>
