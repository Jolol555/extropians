<i>&gt; It's been shown that you can assume either that the number of points on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; line</i><br>
<i>&gt; is aleph-one or aleph-infinity and you'll get no contradiction.  It's much</i><br>
<i>&gt; like Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry.  Most people work with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the number of points on a line = aleph-one = 2^(aleph-null), just</i><br>
<i>&gt; because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it makes the math easier.  This is called the "Continuum Hypothesis" (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; axiom).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That the Continuum Hypothesis can be assumed to be either true or false</i><br>
<i>&gt; without</i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble seems weird.  I conceptualize it by thinking that the number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; points</i><br>
<i>&gt; on a line is an ill-defined thing.</i><br>
<p>
Just to clarify: what's been proved is that the Continuum Hypothesis<br>
is independent of the ordinary (Zermelo-Fraenkel) axioms of set theory.<br>
This is done by constructing "models", universes of sets which satisfy<br>
the ZF axioms and which also satisfy whatever postulate regarding the<br>
cardinality of the continuum you've chosen to work with.<br>
<p>
How to interpret this situation is not clear. Some would see it as<br>
evidence that the transfinite is just a product of the human<br>
imagination. Goedel, I think, felt that it simply meant that the<br>
current axiomatizations of set theory are incomplete, and that by<br>
further thought and clarification of concepts we would eventually<br>
see what the extra axioms should be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;By this do you mean that there are B integers and 2^B points on a line, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;we don't know if there's anything in between?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think there's any cardinality between aleph-null and aleph-one.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you assume the Continuum Hypothesis then there's nothing between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; integers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the line.  If you deny it, then aleph-one, aleph-two, etc.  all come in </i><br>
<i>&gt; between.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, where do aleph-null, aleph-one, etc. fit into all this?  My dictionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;says that aleph-null is "the first transfinite number".  Is that what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; call</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A?  If so, is aleph-one what you call 2^A?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  Aleph-two is 2^(aleph-one) and so on.  There's also an "extended</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuum</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothesis" which holds that the number of all possible functions is</i><br>
<i>&gt; aleph-two.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe it's also undecidable but generally used because it makes life</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier.</i><br>
<p>
My understanding: the Continuum Hypothesis is 2^(aleph-null) = aleph-one.<br>
The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis is that 2^(aleph-X) = aleph-(X+1).<br>
There is no cardinality between aleph-null and aleph-one by definition;<br>
aleph-one is *not* defined as the number of points on the real line<br>
("the cardinality of the continuum"), but simply as "the next biggest<br>
cardinal after aleph-null". I think the original demonstration of<br>
a model of ZF that contradicted the CH (Philip Cohen, 1963?) *can*<br>
work with cardinals of the form aleph-N, where 0 &lt; N &lt; infinity.<br>
Finally, what one *can* say about the number of all functions (from<br>
the reals onto the reals) is not that it's aleph-two, but that it's<br>
2^(2^(aleph-null)).<br>
