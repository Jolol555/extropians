In a message dated 97-10-02 18:54:26 EDT, Delmar England writes about<br>
morality, and says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If I have erred in my deliberations and calculations, please</i><br>
<i>&gt;  point out the wheres and whys of the flaws and I shall be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  grateful.</i><br>
<p>
Let me attmpt to earn a little of your gratitude . . .<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The concept, morality, is probably the most popular topic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  conversation in the world.</i><br>
<p>
For a reason: We want to know what we OUGHT to do, in addition to what we CAN<br>
do.  This is natural for any volitional being.  That we do indeed<br>
consistently seek moral rules seems to be strong empirical evidence that we<br>
in fact have a "free will."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I understand cause and effect, that all actions have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consequences. I understand that consequences to my liking I call</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good, and those I do not like, I call bad.  Does not every</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individual do the same?  I hear "morally right" and "morally</i><br>
<i>&gt;  wrong", but it fits not in my thinking. I can grasp right as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  proper means suited to a specific purpose. By the same token, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  can grasp wrong means for a specific purpose. But purpose is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  matter of individual choice is it not?  So, is a "moralist" simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;  saying that what is suited to his purpose is called moral and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that which is not is called immoral? If not his purpose, whose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Or what's? Can we have "good or bad" without purpose?</i><br>
<p>
It seems you are saying that "good" and "bad" are simply "what I like" and<br>
"what I don't like".  You say that "purpose is a matter of individual choice"<br>
-- but whence comes your choice?  That is the question asked by moral<br>
philosophers.  So far, you seem to say that there is no OUGHT, there is<br>
simply IS.  In this view, the ultimate possibility of moral choice completely<br>
evaporates: No set of values is better than another.  That way lies the ennui<br>
of modern existentialism and the poverty of so-called post-modernist<br>
relativism  Moral philosophy posits at least the possibility that we can have<br>
some rational control, or at least some rational insight into the OUGHT.<br>
 Perhaps we do end with the moral nausea of existentialism, but we shouldn't<br>
head straight for the philosophical alka-seltzer without examining our<br>
options.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  There are those that say that what is according to "God's will"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is moral; that which opposes is immoral. Alas, it appears that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "God's will" is a diverse thing and the differences of opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt;  follow suspiciously along individual lines. One might say that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is immoral to eat a hot dog while another disagrees, but holds</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that it is moral to exterminate all non believers. Thus does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "good and evil" cover a wide "moral and immoral" range" of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  differences. </i><br>
<p>
Those who point to a supernatural authority for moral order MAY follow an<br>
irrational morality: As you point out, this method is ultimately grounded on<br>
a dictat: "Good is good and bad is bad because god (or mom, etc.) says so."<br>
 Most folks who see morality in these terms do not engage in any rational<br>
analysis of their morals and ethics, but simply seek a pre-designated,<br>
authoritative code of conduct that need not and should not be questioned.<br>
 However, there are, in fact, some rational religious moral philosophers who<br>
are willing to honestly search out the logical bases of a theological<br>
morality.  These people will ultimately admit that their morality is based on<br>
authority and submission: They ultimately admit that they follow certain<br>
rules because they believe this is some god's or gods' universe and those<br>
supernatural beings set the moral and ethical rules for the lesser beings who<br>
inhabit that universe, like landlords dictating the terms of a lease to their<br>
tenants.  This conclusion is ULTIMATELY irrational, but only because it is<br>
susceptible to non-moral scientific and metaphysical validation and, so we<br>
see so far, fails that test.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Then there are those who consciously and verbally dismiss such</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mysticism as "God's will", yet cling no less tenaciously to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  idea of morality than the most devout believers in formal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  religion. When pressed for an answer to the question of reference</i><br>
<i>&gt;  for claims of moral or immoral, they are at a loss to provide it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Some say that which is consistent with life is moral; that which</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is inconsistent with life is immoral. This leaves a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  questions unanswered. If one is talking about just bare survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  there still remains the question of personal choice. Beyond this,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  choices, decisions and actions  comprise an active life. To just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  say that "life" is a standard not only denies personal choice,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  but totally ignores the elements that make up an ongoing life. To</i><br>
<i>&gt;  prepare a list of "moral or immoral" things and attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  validate such a list is venture that many include in their daily</i><br>
<i>&gt;  routine.  Thus by inference do they fall right back into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mysticism of "God's will" and a set of "oughts" for one and all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The "oughts" and "shoulds" fill the air and air seems to be their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  only filler, for "ought" is recognition of "not is", and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  twain shall never in reality meet. </i><br>
<p>
I missed a step in your reasoning here, I think.  While I think that a<br>
morality simply based on "life" as an ultimate value is unacceptably<br>
impoverished for conscious beings, one can develop _A_ rational morality<br>
based on it.  One could say that life is good, non-life is bad and then<br>
rationally derive at least some ethical rules based on such a premise.  The<br>
problem with such a simplistic moral philosophy is that all life forms are<br>
not capable of moral judgment.  In such a system, one would encounter large<br>
areas of endeavor where no moral calculus -- i.e. determination of relative<br>
good and bad -- is possible, as you point out.  But it is one possible<br>
rational moral system, but in a very real sense, it is not the BEST one,<br>
because it does not yield sufficiently rich guides for action in practical<br>
terms.  This is, in fact, the basis of my criticism of modern radical<br>
"environmentalism".<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  The issue can be illuminated by a simple observation and a brief</i><br>
<i>&gt;  question or two: The terms, good and bad, have no definitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meaning except in the evaluation of means in respect of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  particular end. </i><br>
<p>
This statement seems to assume the conclusion of your inquiry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suited or unsuited is the question that answers</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the question, good or bad. </i><br>
<p>
This is the classic critique of purely utilitarian moral philosophy, and one<br>
I believe has much merit.  Utilitarianism is a good methodology for ETHICAL<br>
and LEGAL analysis, but answers no ultimate moral questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So how does this "morality" stuff get</i><br>
<i>&gt;  into the picture?  Is the particular end by individual creating,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  or is it a claim of discovery existing independently of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individual creating? If the former, then all individuals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  their ends chosen are no less viable. All arguments of "morality"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are pointless.</i><br>
<p>
Here we see what I call "the metaphysical fallacy" in moral philosophy: You<br>
seem to question whether moral principles EXIST apart from moral actors in<br>
some REAL sense, i.e. you look for them as in some way PHYSICAL referents<br>
"outside" moral actors and, naturally failing to find them, conclude that no<br>
rational or "objective" morality can exist.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  On the other hand, if it is claimed the end reference purpose for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "moral" or "immoral" is discovered outside of self or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  independently of any individual, whether the alleged source is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  called "God", "Nature", whatever,  is immaterial. A purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt;  existing independently of individual creating necessarily implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a volitional source existing independently of individual. </i><br>
<p>
With all due respect, wrong again.  Here you assume the conclusion you<br>
criticize, i.e. that morality must be grounded in the will of a superior<br>
moral actor and, naturally failing to find such a moral super-being, conclude<br>
that no "objective" morality can exist.  We could call this "the theological<br>
fallacy" in moral philosophy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;  one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the former. Although not named and often vehemently denied, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  leaves the latter, i.e, the concept, superior being, as the root</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of "morality."  From the concept, superior being, comes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concept, inferior being. This is inevitably followed by</i><br>
<i>&gt;  subordination and rule. Since history books and daily newspapers</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tell of the horrendous consequences, I need not elaborate here. </i><br>
<p>
So it seems that, having assumed only two possible sources of morality and<br>
failing to find them, you reject the possibility of an objective morality.<br>
 In his post, Gary Lloy points to another possibility; that moral principles<br>
arise naturally from the interaction of beings capable of moral choice:<br>
<p>
In a message dated 97-10-02 22:25:49 EDT, Gary writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future</i><br>
<i>&gt;  behavior. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be</i><br>
reasonably<br>
<i>&gt;  sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.</i><br>
<p>
This is neither morality from authority, nor is it the non-morality of<br>
complete relativism.  Interestingly for extropians, it is the morality of an<br>
agoric system of freely interacting moral agents, a spontaneously developed<br>
"natural morality."  One CAN rationally derive real moral principles simply<br>
from the way volitional agents interact over time.  It is "objective" in the<br>
sense that the moral principles that spontaneously arise from a "moral<br>
marketplace" of free actors are independent of the actors themselves: The<br>
principles are "true" apart from which particular actor we may consider,<br>
subject or object.  Such principles do not fall prey to the metaphysical<br>
fallacy, because they are not "real" in the sense that they have some<br>
existence apart from the process of interaction itself.  But, even though<br>
they aren't "real" in a metaphysical sense, they are capable of objective<br>
verification because we can test the propriety of any particular principle<br>
without regard to viewpoint.<br>
<p>
Extropian transhumanism brings an important new element to a view of "natural<br>
morality" thus derived from the principles of free interaction of moral<br>
agents.  Once one rejects the notion of an immutable ceiling on human nature,<br>
the possibility that the analysis can be short circuited by actors in a<br>
permanently "superior" position disappears.  If one accepts that not all<br>
humans are created equal and that the span of a human life is ultimately<br>
limited, then one can say that principles of moral interaction can be deduced<br>
from a system of freely interacting moral agents, but that ultimately the<br>
humans with the most power will be able to dictate final goals or first<br>
principles (depending on how you look at it) of the system.  In other words,<br>
one can end such an analysis in the conclusion that what is best for the<br>
strongest is "right".  Thus one can conceivably derive fascism from, for<br>
instance, the ideas of Nietzsche.  But when the "moral interaction game"<br>
becomes effectively eternal and unlimited, the system becomes, in a sense,<br>
"morally closed", because no moral actor can be assured of a permanently<br>
superior power position.  Thus one rationally derives basic moral values of<br>
tolerance and reciprocity from the very nature of the world of interacting<br>
volitional beings.<br>
