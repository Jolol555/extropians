<i>&gt; &gt; That's a big risk we'd be taking with the only planet we have. The global</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; climate system is, at this point, complexety beyond our comprehension (many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; factors, some not understood, relating in non-linear ways) and should</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consequently be treated with greatest possible care.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I disagree with that it is beyond our comprehension, but caution is</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly adviced when doing climatic engineering - always have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; backup ecosphere.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it's beyond our current comprehension, anyway.  Ie, we don't<br>
know all that much in any great scientific sense.  Climatic<br>
experiments are few, far between, and generally not scientifically<br>
controlled.<br>
<p>
Climate-ecosystem interactions are even more iffy.<br>
<p>
For instance, I've read in several locations that the reason the<br>
Sahara is a desert, now, rather than a prairie, is because of<br>
centuries of sheep grazing.<br>
<p>
Whether that is right or wrong, I can't say.<br>
<p>
I also can't say if the overall climate changes were a factor in that,<br>
caused by that, or completely independent of that.  But I think it<br>
behooves the literal terraformer to study these questions very, very<br>
carefully.<br>
<p>
Then ask where you're going to put all the displaced people you've<br>
created by flooding coastlines.<br>
