<i>&gt;Weapons don't mean dictatorship.  *Concentration* of weapons in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the hands of an elite means dictatorship over the disarmed masses.</i><br>
<p>
I'd amend this to say *exclusive* concentration of weapons.  Otherwise,<br>
you've just called Canada a dictatorship, since we (I'm Canadian) have<br>
much more restrictive gun laws than the US.  It's legal to own a gun<br>
in Canada, but there's plenty more red tape to get through to do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where weapons are widespread, dictatorship becomes far more difficult.</i><br>
<p>
True, but the price is that petty crime has far more potential to<br>
develop into violent crime, and gangland-style crime has the potential<br>
to become more common.  For example, being mugged at gunpoint is<br>
*completely* unheard of in Toronto, because the kind of people who'd<br>
like to mug can't get their hands on a gun.  I'm under the impression<br>
that "mugging at gunpoint" style robberies are more common in large US<br>
cities than here.  That's what I mean by "petty crime developing into<br>
violent crime".  As for gangland crime: it becomes easier for young<br>
gangster-wanna-be's to fulfil their dreams of gangster-dom if guns are<br>
easily had.  I know that in Toronto, a few schools are becoming more<br>
violent these days than any schools were when I was young, but it's<br>
mostly knife violence.  I shudder to think how bad it could be if the<br>
kids could buy a gun at the local pawn shop.  Heck, it could become as<br>
bad as some places in the US.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(I hear that Albania is quieter now that most households have</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine-guns looted from the army!)</i><br>
<p>
Could you substantiate that?  Where did you "hear" this?  And can<br>
you be sure that there's a cause-and-effect?  Maybe it's quieter<br>
because, now that everybody has guns, all the violent people have<br>
killed each other.  (Which is not necessarily, bad, I'll admit...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But I claim the right to defend myself against aggression, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;includes aggression by tax-collectors and narcs.</i><br>
<p>
If you actively "claim" this right, then you're saying that you<br>
claim the right to ignore the laws of your land at your discretion.<br>
I think that your ideals are noble, but your plan-of-action is less<br>
than admirable, if you actually try to "claim" this right.  If you<br>
don't like the law in a democracy, there are avenues to try to change<br>
it.  If you can't change it, then there are only 3 choices left, as<br>
I see it: (1) avoid the laws by hiding your actions that break them<br>
(ie, tax evasion &amp; smoking joints in secrecy, which is the current<br>
method) (2) Try to change the laws in an unlawful way, ie, violently.<br>
As Kristen points out, this should be self-contradictory to a<br>
libertarian.  (3) Move to a place where the laws are more in line with<br>
your views.  Are there any countries in the world that libertarians<br>
could move to that would be more in line with their views?  I don't<br>
know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my favorite scenario (not necessarily the most likely) for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian transition, there's no upheaval; people just stop</i><br>
<i>&gt;cooperating with Big Brother, until it collapses of its own weight.</i><br>
<p>
This just ain't gonna happen, at least in our lifetimes, because there<br>
are far too few libertarians to stop co-operating.  You'll just have<br>
Big Brother in your face, with his gun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There will be an uneasy period, as everybody waits for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"inevitable" crime wave - but I bet it won't happen.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that there will probably not be a crime wave, but I'd put even<br>
money on there being more violence, probably gang-land related, as<br>
power-hungry organized crime leaders fight it out.  Toronto is beginning<br>
to see a bit of this, unfortunately.  There have been a few gangland<br>
style shoot-outs in the past few years, which were unheard of until<br>
recently.  And by-standers have been hit.  I'd prefer not to live in<br>
a world where there was no deterrent to that kind of crime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As the</i><br>
<i>&gt;drug trade comes from underground into daylight, violence should</i><br>
<i>&gt;decline;</i><br>
<p>
Again, could you justify this?  I can see that as a possibility, but<br>
I can also see the possibility of turf wars being even more violent<br>
than they are now.<br>
