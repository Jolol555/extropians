How many times have you had these feelings and they've been wrong? I know<br>
in my case the answer is 'lots'. And how do you know that you ever had<br>
those feelings and they aren't just false memories created after the<br>
fact? Did you write anything down at the time?<br>
<p>
Personally I think our brains go wrong far, far more often than most of<br>
us realise, and that explains an awful lot of 'psychic' experiences...<br>
and why they can't be reproduced in a laboratory.<br>
