<i>&gt; &gt; to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; about the Singularity back then.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Going from memory (books lent out):</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vernor Vinge gave birth to the concept in 1979.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The first calculation with respect to human-equivalent AI was performed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hans Moravec and gave a result of 2035.  I believe this was 1980 or</i><br>
<i>&gt; thereabouts, although it could be 1984.</i><br>
<p>
Some people trace the Singularity concept to Vinge's story "Bookworm,<br>
Run".  This was published in 1966 and predicted intelligence enhancement<br>
in 1984 (according to the notes published with the story in True Names).<br>
The story ends with the expection of a transformed world.<br>
<p>
Hans Moravec's Mind Children was published in 1988.  He predicts that<br>
computing power capable of human-level AI "would be available in a $10<br>
million supercomputer before 2010 and in a $1,000 personal computer<br>
by 2030."  This would range from 22 to 42 years away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; could occur in that time frame.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah, but that was wild optimism, not an extrapolation based on previous rates</i><br>
<i>&gt; of progress.</i><br>
<p>
If you plotted such things as the fastest a human had ever gone,<br>
or the highest a human had ever gone, you would undoubtedly have<br>
people at Jupiter by 2000 if you extrapolate that curve from ca 1970.<br>
Gregory Sullivan wrote here here last December about predictions by G.<br>
Harry Stine in 1961.  Stine extrapolated based on previous rates of<br>
progress and found that human speeds should become infinite in 1982.<br>
Instead we saw a levelling off of the rate of progress.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the next ten years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yawn.  Copper circuits, qubits, quantum transistors, STM, nanotech, diamond</i><br>
<i>&gt; disk drives, parallel processing, networked computing, etc, etc, ad Singularitum.</i><br>
<p>
Diamond disk drives, parallel processing and network computers<br>
are irrelevant to the technological limitations I was referring to.<br>
I don't know much about copper conductors, but I suspect that they will<br>
provide only a modest improvement in performance, and don't help with the<br>
limitations of the silicon gates themselves.  Qubits, quantum transistors,<br>
STM, and nanotech are unlikely to be providing commercial-quality and<br>
-cost computer components in this time frame.  For the next decade it is<br>
unlikely that we will see a commercially viable move away from silicon,<br>
and if we do, it will probably be to something like gallium arsenide,<br>
which at least has been proven to be usable to build computer circuits.<br>
<p>
The real question is this: will we see a failing of Moore's law in the<br>
next ten years?  Will the performance per price of computers continue<br>
to grow by a factor of two every two years?  This would require five<br>
doublings in the next ten years.  I don't think it will happen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things often take much longer than we expect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2008?  How safe is that?</i><br>
<p>
2008 is not within the 20-30 year prediction horizon, but few people will<br>
agree that it is a reasonable prediction for the Singularity.<br>
