<p>
a)  it would help us to understand how to uplift ourselves,<br>
b)  it would expand our culture -- i.e., we would have new, sentient and<br>
     non-human flavors added to our social stew,<br>
and<br>
c)  just for the fun of it (a life without fun would be not be<br>
practical:).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Also if one uplifts human intelligence into dangerous animals ,...</i><br>
<p>
So far, no one on this list has suggested any dangerous animals.  I<br>
gather it could be done.  But given this argument, why augment<br>
humans?  Certainly, they are the most dangerous -- in terms of<br>
raw killing capacity (from guns to NBC weapons) -- of all animals<br>
we know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;WOW.., Won't that be something like Aliens Resurrection.....</i><br>
<p>
If I recall that series correctly, the organisms had nothing like human<br>
intelligence.  The danger was they were smart enough, they were<br>
extremely hardy, and needed to kill humans to reproduce.  (Nothing<br>
on what they eat, but I assume they were not strict vegans.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'd serious consider the re-percussions of such a move ,</i><br>
<p>
That is part of the purpose of this discussion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;or hold a referrendum on this issue....?!</i><br>
<p>
I would be strongly against that.  I bet most people would be against<br>
the<br>
Bill of Rights if we voted on it today.  There would, of course, be some<br>
rational discussion, but, from what I've seen, those with the best<br>
doomsday scenarios, however unlikely or even impossible, would win<br>
the majority over.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;This makes more extropian sense, if you are to gather more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;information about our universe ; explore it and colonize</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it,....with self-replicating machines with Uploaded Human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Intelligence in them or many-times; manifold mega-human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;intelligence onboard</i><br>
<p>
No reason to choose one or the other.  However, I think uplifting can<br>
be achieved now, while uploading is decades away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'd always thought of the current space probes like Cassini etc..</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they are robots which have extended human senses ,...which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is like a piece of you and me out there in harsh environment,...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;doing measurement and collecting data in our place,....</i><br>
<p>
A good image.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Uploaded Machines can do much much much more,....</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;That's great,... providing you have eliminated the destructive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;tendencies / low-reptitian etc etc aspect of our Human makeup</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Agreed?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know.  Can these tendencies be parceled and expunged so<br>
easily?  And, if so, is it desireable?  Might they not serve a purpose<br>
even for posthumans?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Or else we'll end up with a situation far worst than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;runaway Uplifting scenario...Any suggestions ? ....headways ?</i><br>
<p>
Mine is, for now, experiment more and more.<br>
<p>
