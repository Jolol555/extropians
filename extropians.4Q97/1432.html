Sure, it's just that as a philosopher I am allergic to signs of <br>
conceptual confusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Noun/verb/adjective is an artificial distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on conventions of language (natural languages, that is;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lojban has no such concept), but "hardware/software" is a real,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental distinction.  Most of the talk here about identity is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just arguing definitions for the natural-language "I", and there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are two axes of argument: one, does it refer to hardware or to</i><br>
<i>&gt; software (to which I think most here will agree upon the latter),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the second axis, does "I" refer to the particular instantiation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the pattern (in Lojban "le sevzi") or to the abstraction of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; pattern independent of particular instances ("le ka sevzi").  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer to that is again just a matter of language convention, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject of rational debate.</i><br>
<p>
That is controversial claim (which I personally happen to be <br>
somewhat sympathetic towards). It is controversial because to many <br>
people it seems as if the concept "I" is not arbitrary; even though <br>
one may be hard put to define necessary and sufficient criteria for <br>
personal identity, it seems that the notion has important relations <br>
to values that are not shared by other notions we could form. That <br>
is to say: if we stipulate that the word "I#1" should mean this <br>
thing, and "I#2" should mean that, then there still seems to be some <br>
thinking to be done about whether one would be willing to upload in <br>
circumstances where identity is concerved in sense #1, but not in <br>
sense #2, etc.<br>
<p>
[Derek Parfit's "Reasons and Persons" (1984) is an important<br>
philosophy book about the problem of personal identity. Max's PhD <br>
dissertation (on his web page) is also on this topic. I haven't read <br>
it yet but plan to do so when I get time.]<br>
