I'm in an _advocatus diaboli_ mood, having just seen the movie. Prefix all my<br>
comments below with (po) if it helps... :)<br>

<i>&gt; ruled that as a mitigating factor and let me off.</i><br>
<p>
You were lucky. You could have gone down. The court showed mercy. Did the Judge<br>
dismiss, or were you found "not guilty"? I'm guessing the former. If the latter,<br>
the state could have appealed and won. Not that they'd bother...<br>
<p>
I also find it interesting that the USCG was enforcing _state_ laws. I'm not sure<br>
that's within their powers/jurisdiction, though I'm sure they do it all the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of two things would need to happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  But as long as there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will always attempt to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That is where civil disputes are still a big part of libertarian theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Use of civil legal remedies to counteract coercive acts in a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; society has been fully hashed out.</i><br>
<p>
You both miss another point: one of the profits of authoritarianism is delegation.<br>
Some people *want* other people to be coerced by yet other people. So some people<br>
will always attempt to create a State.  See below...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would by no stretch of the imagination call the US Constitution, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thomas Jefferson a fascist document or a fascist person.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only way</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can even make any parallel between communism and libertarianism is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they are at extreme opposite ends of any political spectrum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertarians want to be able to prevent others from violating other</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals while communists consider violating other's rights as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious given.</i><br>
<p>
*Ahem*. Well, let me step up to the plate here for a minute. I think the parallel<br>
is between communism and anarchy. They'd both work if you could get there, but<br>
maybe "you can't get there from here." That's my biggest problem with both of them.<br>
"Anarchy at gunpoint" is no fun, and pretty damned low-quality anarchy to boot.<br>
<p>
Now this may not be the point the Codewarrior Princess was trying to make, but I<br>
think it's a closer fit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can anyone talk me out of this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Easy, the internet is possibly the largest and most successful</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian experiment in history, and you don't see wars, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Yet. So far it's hard to project power in cyberspace, and impossible to take and<br>
hold territory. This may not hold true forever.<br>
<p>
A balance of power, and a bunch of other conditions detailed in Axelrod's _EoC_,<br>
need to obtain for cooperation to be a successful ESS. I wish this were as obvious<br>
to everyone as it is to me. But you can't teach calculus to a starving peasant, and<br>
that fact is not the peasant's fault.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Obsolescent governments are trying to force sovreignty on the internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; by have found that to be rather problematic. Since anything crossing</i><br>
<i>&gt; state lines is legaly interstate commerce, they can't under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution legally mess with it, and so long as congress sees a</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian policy vis a vis the internet as a positive business</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment, they won't change it, and even the Communications Decency</i><br>
<i>&gt; Act they tried to pass has been tossed out, so even their power is</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited. Because the internet is predominantly a communications medium</i><br>
<i>&gt; between people, the First Amendment is paramount with anything done on</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. WHile there is little case law on the internet, the touchy areas</i><br>
<i>&gt; with things like porno on the net in the end will I beleive, be found to</i><br>
<i>&gt; only be enforceable in the originating data's jurisdiction under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards of that jurisdiction. If such a policy is not ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; practiced, we can all shortly expect to be living on the net according</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the moral codes of the Wahabi sect of Saudi Arabia. SInce that does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not seem palatable to most people, such a situation would obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; naturally encourage people to err on the side of libertarianism.</i><br>
<p>
Until a cyber jihad.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt; discussion about property...<br>
<p>
There's a real problem, way down deep, about where disputes end and clear title<br>
obtains. It may be as tough a nut to crack as what "fair" means... a Unified "FAIR"<br>
Theory so far escapes me, but I'm working on the cognitive quark model at the<br>
moment. Wish me luck. Good luck on Davis-Lorrey mechanics. If it works, I want to<br>
be a test pilot. :)<br>
