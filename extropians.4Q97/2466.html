: As a caveat I would say: a) I hope Anton has taken, or plans to take<br>
: in the near future, gun and hunter safety courses, possibly even self<br>
: defense courses,<br>
<p>
I've been flinging the occasional box of lead for four years now;<br>
while certainly I have plenty of room for improvement, there's<br>
little risk of killing myself or the cat.  Thanks for your concern.<br>
<p>
: and b) I wish he had bought an American made firearm.<br>
: I could have helped him acquire, for the same price or less, a new,<br>
: fully tested and posessing a lifetime warranty, Ruger rifle. When I<br>
: mean lifetime, I mean LIFETIME. I've seen people send in the most<br>
: abused, messed up guns to be fully repaired or replaced at no charge.<br>
: Anton couldn't hope to get that from his Vietnamese arms merchant.<br>
<p>
My Vietnamese arms merchant is an importer in Pennsylvania.<br>
Three of my friends have SKS so I have ready sources of advice.<br>
Ceteris paribus I'd rather not buy from Ruger, because of his support<br>
of evil legislation.<br>
<p>
I did look at a Ruger rifle.  The sight picture was not as good,<br>
it didn't feel quite as "right" in my hands, and it was another<br>
hundred bucks or so (maybe all guns are cheaper in NH than in<br>
California?).  <br>
<p>
: The only thing I would criticize Anton about is that.<br>
<p>
How unimaginative.  You could criticize me for *lots* of things<br>
if you'd been paying attention.  &lt;g&gt;<br>
