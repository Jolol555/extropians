Yes, and it's much worse than that.  Captain Cathie, who flew people back<br>
and forth across the Pacific in 737s, had these wise words to offer in<br>
PULSE OF THE UNIVERSE (1977):<br>
<p>
`The coordinate of 2545584412 was doubled in the diagonals of the polar<br>
squares, with all its associated harmonics, and in the resultant grid polar<br>
square the speed of light reciprocal harmonic of 6944 was incorporated in<br>
the harmonic 26944.  These particular coordinates are from the corner<br>
"aerial" positions to the geographic poles.  *It appeared that the factor 2<br>
preceding the 6944 served to harmonically double the reciprocal of the<br>
speed of light*.' (p. 26, my emphasis)<br>
<p>
Leave aside the brainless gobbledegook.  Would you feel safe flying with a<br>
guy who conjectured that putting a 2 in front of a long number `doubled'<br>
that number?   It's true that Cathie did not hold absolutely to this<br>
interesting algorithm.  On p. 55, he observed that 144 by 4 / pi = 576 /<br>
pi.  Surely it should have been 4144 / pi?  A while later, we learn that<br>
`the cube root of harmonic 2384573471 = 28783.056' (p. 189)... and so on.<br>
This book is immensely influential, I gather, among New Age geomancers, UFO<br>
fanciers and feral geniuses in the Deep North of Australia.<br>
