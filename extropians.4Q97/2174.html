Many members of the list seem to be seeking physical get-togethers.<br>
I suggest that everyone interested in such meetings post a message<br>
to the list with the word "Location" in the subject, and as much <br>
information<br>
as they care to give about contacting them in the body of the message.<br>
<p>
Please don't misspell "Location", as I'm going to be filtering it into a<br>
special folder.  My posted location will be in a day or two as I allow<br>
time for others to establish filters.<br>
<p>
We might consider establishing standard subject lines  for certain kinds<br>
of posts (standards that go further than the kind of ad hoc ones in<br>
existence now).  Someone willing to donate a little time and a web page<br>
could then maintain a document of those standards.  The document's<br>
location could be posted to the list (or lists, or whatever the future<br>
arrangement is to be) periodically for newbies.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your time,<br>
Bobby Martin<br>
