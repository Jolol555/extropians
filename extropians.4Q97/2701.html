Standard chemistry knowledge.  About 1/3 of the nitrogen fixed to ammonia<br>
compounds (the bioavailable form) is done by chemical plants.  The numbers<br>
should be in any basic agricultural or chemical reference; I got it from a <br>
recent SciAm article.  There are no controls; it's done to get fertilizer,<br>
not to change the world.  It changes the world as a side effect (just like<br>
nitrogen-fixing bacteria or photosynthetic plants).<br>

<i>&gt;What has the natural world failed to provide? </i><br>

<p>
Natural food production became inadequate about 10 kya.  So humans started<br>
agriculture.  It appears we've just hit the limits of natural fish production;<br>
expect a lot more fish farming in the near future.<br>
<p>
Generally we don't completely stop events; just change their frequency.<br>
There are a few examples; we don't get swarms of malarial mosquitos in<br>
the American South anymore, but those are exceptional.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Rather, it's now the "natural" world which requires the focused effort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; large numbers of humans to maintain it in the face of all the other people</i><br>
who<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; want to change it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Indeed, since reason is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;human phenomenon, and humans are a natural phenomenon, and phenomenons are</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;dynamic expression of the natural world, any effort to maintain the natural</i><br>
world<br>
<i>&gt;in a static condition would be contradictory to the essence of that ever-</i><br>
changing<br>
<i>&gt;natural world.</i><br>
<p>
I'd agree.  That's why I put "natural" in quotes.  Nonetheless, lots of people<br>
are trying; that's why you can't even bring sled dogs into Antarctica anymore.<br>
