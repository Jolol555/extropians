<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Doesn't this contradict your initial statement?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;No it does not. In the first instance I said that *observations* tend at </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;this stage to support an open universe. In the second instance I said </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;that there are many *theoretical* reasons for believing a closed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;universe is probable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't want to nitpick too much, but your statement was "There are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; multitude of other observed phenomena which align[sic] well with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory of a closed universe, as well as theoretical reasons for believing </i><br>
<i>&gt; that such a case is probable."  (The statement this contradicts is your </i><br>
<i>&gt; qualified admission that "...I agree that current observations tend to </i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest an open universe...")  The first part of that sentence seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; to me to translate into there being _evidence_ for a closed universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is this evidence?  </i><br>
<p>
I am sorry - I used the term in it's non-empirical sense, which is what <br>
has caused the confusion. There is such a thing as theoretical evidence <br>
yes? I don't want to get into semantics; I concede that I worded my <br>
statement badly. My only excuse is that I generally read the list email late <br>
at night when, I am beginning to suspect, my mind has already began the <br>
processes necessary for sleep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And why would there be good theoretical</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons if somewhere the theory did not match up with some facts?</i><br>
<p>
If, for instance, there are fairly good empirical results from which <br>
theoretically pleasing models can be made, but the models do not <br>
completely and utterly explain all phenomena. This type of thing occurs <br>
often in a science such as cosmology where a small amount of very <br>
important observations (microwave background radiation, expanding <br>
universe, etc.) are the basis for a great deal of theory. An analogy on <br>
a smaller scale: we don't even understand how our own solor system <br>
formed, even though we know a great deal about how it works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It appears the universe is open, but I'm interested in why, if it does,</i><br>
<i>&gt; do some still maintain otherwise.  What reasons do they have?  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; are these reasons valid and tractable?  In the interim, we might do</i><br>
<i>&gt; well to discuss/try to understand the idea of an open, globally</i><br>
<i>&gt; hyperbolic universe -- rather than be shackled to the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; Standard model, which might become obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One, but by no means the only, model of an open universe is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; of David Layzer.  But even if his model is found to be faulty, any</i><br>
<i>&gt; good theory of cosmology should be able to account for the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the universe has a lot less mass than would needed to close</i><br>
<i>&gt; it -- given current observations.</i><br>
<p>
Or be so fitted to other observations that an examination for other <br>
matter besides the observed matter is warranted.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please do not take the above to mean that I think science is</i><br>
<i>&gt; ruthlessly empirically driven.  It is not -- at least, not in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashion pure empiricists would have us believe.  Instead, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it rest not on accumulating evidence, but on</i><br>
<i>&gt; explaining/integrating wider fields of evidence.  (This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; why, to try to add something to the quantum physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate, classical mechanics has been superseded.  Post-</i><br>
<i>&gt; classical theories (QM, QFT, QED, QCD, ST, GT, etc.) are</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to explain more with less: more facts with less ad hoc</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypotheses.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An aside: What are the probabilities and how are they</i><br>
<i>&gt; measured in this area?</i><br>
<p>
Which probabilities and which area?<br>
<p>
