Greg: what about Hong Kong?  It has a higher GDP/capita than any of the<br>
countries you mentioned (CIA factbook says 21300 Japan, 22000 Sing., <br>
27500 Hong Kong (same as US!)) and was under the British.  Is it<br>
Confucian capitalism, or have they assimilated Western values?<br>
<p>
And what are the odds of a more pragmatic approach?  Everyone yaks about<br>
"human rights", like the Chinese are committing some obvious crime<br>
against nature, or something.  David Brin points out that we can afford<br>
to have a quasi-religious attitude to free speech because its benefits<br>
are so miraculous.  Perhaps we should be pushing "cultural technology":<br>
ways of organizing a society, like free speech, mutual accountability,<br>
private property, as the best means to satisfy their explicit goals,<br>
like wealth and getting rid of corruption.  (And surely they'll care<br>
about pollution at some point?)  People who object to Western culture<br>
and "values" have no qualms about grabbing our factories and planes.<br>
Perhaps we should put more emphasis on the practical benefits of our<br>
societies, and cut the appeals to morals they don't share.<br>
