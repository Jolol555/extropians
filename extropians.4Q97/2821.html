<i>&gt;    The murder rate in the United States surpasses that of every other</i><br>
<i>&gt;    industrialized country in the world. The murder rate in Washington,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    D.C. is fifteen times greater than that in Northern Ireland, a nation</i><br>
<i>&gt;    plagued by terrorism.(9) This level of handgun violence does not occur</i><br>
<i>&gt;    in other developed nations.  In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22</i><br>
<i>&gt;    people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    U.S.(10)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    The number of young men killed in the U.S. versus the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    world also is staggering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    In 1990, the homicide rate per 100,000 population for males ages 15 -</i><br>
<i>&gt;    24 was as follows:(11)</i><br>

<i>&gt; My favourite sentence is, "In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22</i><br>
<i>&gt; people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S."  Think about that for a second (just one second should suffice)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then tell me again how the lack of handguns doesn't affect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; peacefulness of a society.</i><br>
<p>
It is interesting that you said absolutely nothing about the Washington<br>
DC Murder rates. DC does, of course, have the most restrictive gun<br>
control laws in the entire country. It is no wonder it has the highest<br>
murder rate, as the murderers are quite confident that the people they<br>
murder are not armed, are not capable of defending themselves.<br>
<p>
Studies of gun crime in the US show that gun crime rates are highest in<br>
areas that have the most restrictive gun control laws.<br>
<p>
Additionally, it has also been shown that the murder rate among young<br>
men 15-24 is solely tied into the current, and ebbing, wave of gang<br>
violence, which is stimulated by the gangsta-rap culture they live in.<br>
<p>
Now, on the overall murder rates being higher, I won't debate, its<br>
obvious that a free society like ours will tend to grant its citizens<br>
the liberty to be able to commit the sort of crimes involved, while<br>
societies like those in europe, descended from fuedal systems in which<br>
only the aristocracy had a right to bear arms, are obviously not free,<br>
in that the government protects the citizens from themselves.<br>
<p>
THis sort of attitude does not fly here in the US, except in liberal<br>
enclaves and inside the beltway. As seen in the Ruby Ridge, Waco,<br>
Oklahoma City, and the recent "Roby Ridge" incidents, Americans do not<br>
put up with their government treating its citizens as the enemy, do not<br>
beleive that the government knows better how citizens should live their<br>
lives. Most of us outside the liberal establishment know that the 2nd<br>
amendment is what guarrantees the continued existence of all of the<br>
others against government encroachment, but that knowledge is<br>
diminishing under continued onslaught from the liberal media elite who<br>
refuse to post ANY peices that may put gun use in a positive light. This<br>
is no joke, a memo from Ted Turner to his staff at CNN explicitly<br>
instructs this.<br>
<p>
However, this is not the only reason for the high murder rate. Indeed,<br>
prior to the 60's, the US murder rate was no higher than any other<br>
industrialized nation. Up to this time, the 2nd amendment had been in<br>
existence for over 180 years to no ill effect. Prior to this time, as<br>
well, the inner cities of America were more densely crowded, with much<br>
higher poverty rates, much greater levels of prejudice, racism, and<br>
ethnic strife, and gun posession was as high or higher then than it is<br>
now.<br>
<p>
What is it then that HAS changed here in the US???<br>
<p>
a) the capital punishment laws were first repealed, and then when<br>
reenacted made it almost impossible to execute even the most heinous<br>
criminals. It turns out that a convicted murderer on death row has a<br>
longer life expectancy than if he or she were loose on the streets. Is<br>
that capital punishment???<br>
<p>
b) criminal rights protections in the courts are much more respected<br>
than prior to the 50's. While this may be a good thing for individual<br>
rights as a whole, and respect for the rights of the accused to be<br>
treated as innnocent until proven guilty, it is only in the last few<br>
years that the rights of victims and victims families have begun to bear<br>
any weight in court proceedings.<br>
<p>
c) the educational system here in the US has been gutted by a<br>
monopolistic union, where gun and hunter safety courses, rifle teams,<br>
and JROTC activities have been banned from the curriculum, so that<br>
children have had absolutely no chance to learn about responsible gun<br>
use, and our cultural heritage of liberty derived from gun use, from<br>
positive role models, while at the same time, the liberal entertainment<br>
industry delights in supplying the population with 'entertainment' that<br>
celebrates violence, irresponsible gun use, and depicts gun owners<br>
generally as radical wing nuts and threats to public safety.<br>
<p>
d) and most importantly, Gun Control Laws have been enacted on a very<br>
wide basis across the country since the 60's (originally in response to<br>
the JFK, RFK, and MLK assasinations), which made previously law abiding<br>
citizens into criminals, stripped citizens of the ability to defend<br>
themselves, while imposing pathetically minimal sentences on criminals<br>
convicted of crimes while using firearms, or while violating firearms<br>
laws (like the law against convicted felons owning guns, duh).<br>
<p>
Given all of this, it is rather obvious that the high murder rates here<br>
in the US can be mainly blamed on the failed policies of the liberal<br>
establishment in the last 30 years.<br>
