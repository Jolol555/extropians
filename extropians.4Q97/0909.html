Authorities doesn't *have* to always attack new ideas, even if that<br>
has become "folk wisdom" by now. It seems that as long as the threat<br>
to the establishment is not "real" in the sense that it exists in the<br>
physical world rather in potentia, it is not perceived as a threat and<br>
can be studied fairly objectively, but when it becomes a present<br>
threat all resources are arrayed against it.<br>
<p>
This is a form of short-sightedness that seems to appear in most large<br>
institutions, and which IMHO will almost guarantee that most of the<br>
current institutions will not survive the first decades of the next<br>
century. <br>
