Well, if you look at that aging disease that a few rare kids have, if<br>
that sort of disorder can be turned on and off in anyone, then you could<br>
do some sort of rapid development, but I would think that the product of<br>
such things would tend to be on the short side.<br>

<i>&gt; Speaking of cold fusion fairies, does anyone here know about free energy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; over-unity field theory or any other progressive engery theories? I heard</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bryan O'Leary speaking about this subject on the radio and his impression</i><br>
<i>&gt; seemed to be that there were already working models of these systems in</i><br>
<i>&gt; India and Japan.</i><br>
<p>
There have been several, supported by some large corps over in Japan.<br>
The most convincing evidence that fusion is involved was an experiment<br>
involving heavy water and dissolved potassium salts. Apparently, the<br>
test module produced excess calcium that could only be explained by<br>
fusion of the deuterium with potassium (with an accompanying consistent<br>
level of heat produced). There is also an outfit in Dallas claiming to<br>
be producing hot water heaters using the same catalytic method as Pons &amp;<br>
Fleischman, but they can't claim that it's cold fusion because the<br>
patent office has banned the use of the phrase (nice to see in our<br>
office of innovation, eh?). Their drawings include a reactor about the<br>
size of a shotgun shell, filled with pellets of the electrode materials,<br>
produced by a proprietary method.<br>
<p>
Whether it works or not I don't know. I'm also interested in hearing<br>
whats up in this field.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What say you? It seems that the best ideas i've heard about transportation</i><br>
<i>&gt; involve some thoughtful combination of a free-energy system and</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-gravity. Could a vehicle which repels mass to stay afloat ever get</i><br>
<i>&gt; into a head-on collision with another similar vehicle?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Jeff Taylor, whipping boy.</i><br>
<p>
The most recent non resident whipping boy, Arthur C. Clarke, was a big<br>
proponent of air cushion vehicles, forecasting their replacement of<br>
automobiles within 50 years (date of original projection: sometime in<br>
the 50's). Of course this never happened, partly because they are: a) so<br>
noisy b)so energy hungry and c) being frictionless meant that poor<br>
maneuveribility in the event of uneven terrain or wind made them<br>
unusable as a major transport form. Me thinks that for all purpose daily<br>
transportation, anti gravity will not become feasible, except possibly<br>
for mass transportation. Traffic is bad enough, imagine millions of cars<br>
careening about like discs on an air hockey board. <br>
<p>
Any feasible anti gravity technology would be most useful in aircraft<br>
and spacecraft. Now, replacing cars with personal antigravity propelled<br>
aircraft is somehting else entirely. With smart navigation technologies,<br>
using all of that volume in the air is a much smarter way to go about<br>
it. Of course, if there is an accident, expect to die, unless airbag<br>
technology is heavily used, in a manner like the Mars Pathfinder landing<br>
method. Bounce, bounce, bounce...<br>
