Brian Fritz writes<br>
: A mule is the offspring of a donkey and a horse.  I've read some where<br>
: that a chimpanzee and a human are genetically closer than a donkey and<br>
: a horse.  Wouldn't cross breeding humans with other primates qualify<br>
: as a form of uplifting?  I think this would be technically possible<br>
: right now.  Although it may be politically difficult.<br>

Well, there's Oliver ...<br>
<p>
Oliver was found in West Africa about thirty years ago and brought<br>
to America.  His face is like a chimpanzee, but he walks erect.<br>
I first heard of him in a segment on television about a year ago;<br>
somebody is doing genetic tests to decide what his parents were.<br>
I think it not unlikely that Oliver's mother was a chimpanzee<br>
and his father a man.<br>
<p>
(Anybody remember _Firstborn_, a miniseries about the child of a Mad<br>
Scientist and a gorilla?  Who played the M.S., was it Charles Dance?)<br>
