<p>
<p>
  My favorite subject, the teleological threads.<br>
I do not think weeding out potential phenotypes is much different from<br>
getting rid of the real ones. In order to weed a potential process out,<br>
you have to run a representative model of it, or test the beta/final version<br>
on a small time/resource scale. The differences between a model, test run<br>
and a "full" process are quite unclear, especially in the environment where<br>
every process is a test/model of its future self and forks lots of parallel<br>
children trying to resolve different and similar issues at the same time.<br>
Sometimes, one of the children may have resolved the problem that<br>
the whole batch of them was created (the task could be, for example,<br>
improving of default communication protocols between intelligent nodes<br>
in a knowledge network - i.e. development of a basic ethical system).<br>
After the solution is found and tested, it can be implemented, and the<br>
rest of the children can be suspended or killed in mid-execution.<br>
They won't feel "hurt" , and neither will the environment - so what's the<br>
problem?<br>
<p>
Let's imagine an absolutely unlikely (IMO) world with infinite resources of<br>
all kinds, where all potential things are generated at the same time, and<br>
nothing is ever erased (I have a problem here, with entities trying to<br>
exercise their freedom and get rid of their unwanted parts, with these<br>
parts disagreeing.  Could I shave off my moustache if it was intelligent<br>
and arguing for its right to continue its existence in its natural habitat?<br>
Or I could only create a clone of myself without the moustache, leaving<br>
the moustached original enslaved to a tuft of intelligent hair.  How intelligent<br>
do we want the [sub-]entities to be to grant them such rights? )<br>
<p>
  Even in this situation of infinite resources though, all interesting and efficient<br>
things/beings will be distinct from the ones created under "Rights of Continuing<br>
Existence" or "Rights of Implementation" Acts.  Those entities will be all<br>
garbage, and every single one of them that has any intelligence will be aware<br>
of it.  They will represent practically all existing structures at any time, and may<br>
occupy any point in the Universe, except that on its semantic map they will<br>
never be on the frontier, always banished to the inner semantic junkyard/ the Slow<br>
Zone, knowing that they are completely unneeded, their goals have no meaning,<br>
and their wishes to attach themselves to anything else, though always granted,<br>
create nothing but useless, ever-suffering cripples.<br>
<p>
If this all starts sounding like a bizarre dream, this must be for a reason.  I think<br>
we should drop the remnants of anthropomorphism.  We made a step in this<br>
direction when we started discussing evolution instead of static identities, and<br>
another step - with transition from structure threads to goal threads as the<br>
subjects of progress.  Now lets drop persistence and continuity - I mean as<br>
things that *must* be maintained in the development process; they can still<br>
exist here and there, just as structural threads and even static formations - but<br>
only as temporary/specialty tools.  Another concept that I think should be<br>
abandoned in the discussion of future intelligent entities, is that there will<br>
be clear borders between them.  Instead, I expect the teleological threads<br>
(or flows, as this term doesn't suggest linear succession) to employ and<br>
share multiple remote sensors and actuators and distributed specialized<br>
knowledge servers and communication vehicles on a time sharing/contract<br>
basis.  It may look quite weird, but it still seems plausible - unlike the<br>
world of infinite resources where everything starts and nothing ends.<br>
<p>
With that, I am ending the process of writing this message, and it's OK,<br>
because it has fulfilled its intended goal.  It can die now.  Other processes<br>
may later start their own typing threads partially based on this one.<br>
