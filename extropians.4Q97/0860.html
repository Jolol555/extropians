I have metad (to meta?) this posting with [GUNS] to perm2it easy<br>
filtering, I believe preserving ones own life/freedom to be an<br>
appropriate extropian topic.<br>

<i>&gt;True, but the price is that petty crime has far more potential to</i><br>

<i>&gt;potential to become more common.  For example, being mugged at</i><br>
<i>&gt;gunpoint is *completely* unheard of in Toronto, because the kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;of people who'd like to mug can't get their hands on a gun.</i><br>
<p>
Thats because HANDGUNS are rare, would you share Canadian muggings<br>
at knifepoint statistics with us......<br>
<p>
Here in Chicago two years ago there were 950+ murders, 140+ by<br>
"kitchen knife", 130+ by "Baseball bat" and only one (a domestic)<br>
by a so called assault weapon. Guess which one was banned.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I'm under the impression that "mugging at gunpoint" style</i><br>
<i>&gt;robberies are more common in large US cities than here.</i><br>
<p>
It happens here where I live here in Chicago, which is shocking<br>
(sarcasm alert) since handguns have been illegal in Chicago since<br>
1983. "Only criminals and cops have handguns in Chicago."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's what I mean by "petty crime developing into violent crime".</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for gangland crime: it becomes easier for young</i><br>
<i>&gt;gangster-wanna-be's to fulfil their dreams of gangster-dom if guns</i><br>
<i>&gt;are easily had.  I know that in Toronto, a few schools are</i><br>
<i>&gt;becoming more violent these days than any schools were when I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;young, but it's mostly knife violence.  I shudder to think how bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;it could be if the kids could buy a gun at the local pawn shop. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Heck, it could become as bad as some places in the US.</i><br>
<p>
Once again by your own admission we are seeing an increase in<br>
violent trends, but the lack of handguns means they are knife<br>
attacks instead.<br>
<p>
Gang shootings are down, that's because the shooter is often<br>
identified, that information makes it back by word of mouth to<br>
the rival gang, and the shooter and his family now become targets.<br>
The crime is becoming rarer because the gangs are literally<br>
running out of shooters. The gangs have attempted to reduce the<br>
"transaction cost" by the increased anominity of the "Drive-By"<br>
type shooting.<br>
<p>
 In areas where concealed carry has been reinstituted, the<br>
murder,rape and armed assault crime rates drop dramatically. The<br>
best known case of this was in Miami, where the criminals began<br>
targeting easily identifiable tourists (unarmed) rather than risk<br>
confronting an armed citizen.<br>
<p>
The answer to crime is a combination of early detection and<br>
prevention, (education) and swift and serious punishment when<br>
commited, i.e. a twenty year sentence with no chance of parole for<br>
commiting a crime with a handgun. (raise the transaction cost to<br>
appropriate levels)<br>
