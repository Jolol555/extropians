<p>
Adjectives are not universal, but nouns and verbs are not an artifical<br>
distinction or categorization made by people with nothing better to do;<br>
they refer to real units of organization in _all_ human languages.  It's<br>
not just convenience that allows linguists to say a string of phonemes in<br>
a given language is a noun or verb; verbs and nouns relate to each other<br>
and to other parts of utterances in specific ways.<br>
<p>
Speech is special; language is not a cultural creation or a product of<br>
"general intelligence."  Language is a detailed system of pointers to<br>
ideas, categories, concepts and memories shared by members of a speech<br>
community which seems to have evolved for the purpose of social<br>
integration and group interaction.  Language has a large number of subtle<br>
structural details which are universal across all natural languages; these<br>
include nouns and verbs; Case (how verbs relate to nouns, as opposed to<br>
case with a small "c" which is a surface labeling of such relationships);<br>
anaphor and deixis (difficult to explain... I guess they could be summed<br>
up as how reflexives and pronouns relate to antecedants and "empty" units<br>
like "this," "that" whose referrant changes from situation to situation)<br>
and many more.  <br>
The surface diversity of languages is illusory; as Chomsky has said,<br>
Marian linguists would surely consider all humans to speak a common<br>
language, albeit one with several mutually incomprehensible lexicons.<br>
<p>
The problems associated with language and clarity of thinking are not,<br>
IMHO, the product of language per se but rather demonstrate the<br>
limitations of the human mind.  We didn't evolve to be logic machines<br>
which explore and come to understand the universe for what it is; our<br>
cognition developed to help us get killed less easily and to kill other<br>
animals more easily.  In other words, our mental abilities are perfect for<br>
hunting, gathering and foraging on the savannah but the fact that we can<br>
theorize about the structure of nuclei and galaxies is accidental and it<br>
should be no surprise that we have difficulty not jumping to conclusions,<br>
neglecting to consider alternative hypotheses, etc.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; based on conventions of language (natural languages, that is;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lojban has no such concept),</i><br>
<p>
What are the qualifications of the creators of Lojban?  Computer<br>
scientists, logicians?  If they they think that a human mind can process<br>
"language" without nouns, etc., they are profoundly mistaken.  Natural<br>
language does not refer to languages which are not concsiously created;<br>
natural language means a language which conforms to Universal Grammar;<br>
this includes created languages such as Esperanto, Ido, Volapuek and<br>
Interlingua.  Nat.lang. is a category opposed to logical languages such as<br>
predicate calculus or to computer languages.  Nouns, verbs, deixis,<br>
anaphor and other such principles are the algorithms and heuristics by<br>
which we make language.  Never confuse language with thinking.<br>
<p>
 but "hardware/software" is a real,<br>
<i>&gt; fundamental distinction.  Most of the talk here about identity is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just arguing definitions for the natural-language "I", and there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are two axes of argument: one, does it refer to hardware or to</i><br>
<i>&gt; software (to which I think most here will agree upon the latter),</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I understand you.  Do you mean, is language a fundamental<br>
part of human cognition? or a conventionalized way of thinking which can<br>
be replaced?  Or do you mean, is language identical to thought versus a<br>
creation of thoughts?  I'd say the neurological evidence (aphasia<br>
studies, the way we process speech sounds vs. other sounds, etc.)<br>
supports the hypothesis that language production and perception have<br>
their origin in specific brain structures.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and the second axis, does "I" refer to the particular instantiation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the pattern (in Lojban "le sevzi") or to the abstraction of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; pattern independent of particular instances ("le ka sevzi").  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer to that is again just a matter of language convention, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject of rational debate.</i><br>
<p>
Again, I'm not sure I follow.  Do you mean is language "I" identical to<br>
the mutually comprehensible utterances of a group of speakers or is "I"<br>
the patterns displayed in such utterances?  Or...?<br>
