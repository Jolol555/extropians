I guess my definition of profound holds a little more weight... but, yes,<br>
I agree, the majority of people have been affected(profoundly or not) by<br>
Bill Gates.<br>
<p>
BTW, I don't love or hate Bill Gates, I just seem to have frequent<br>
problems with his company's software.<br>

Well I definitely do not agree with the "others."  What if your property<br>
is surrounded by a bunch of hired hypnotists from Coke swinging<br>
pendulums and chanting "drink coke, drink coke" (OK, that's kind of silly)<br>
But still, if people own all the property around you, and you just happen<br>
to look out your window... I think you have been physically coerced.  The<br>
only defense I can see for this in an anarcho-capitalistic society is for<br>
some consumer organization to monitor companies that practice coercion and<br>
organized massive buoycotts.  Still, if Coke can hypnotize enough people,<br>
why would they care about a buoycott?  Maybe the consumer organization<br>
should take more drastic action in this case...<br>
<p>
I see an anarcho-capitalist society as being a bit violent, but certainly<br>
more interesting.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; What benefit are con artists to their victims?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A victim of a con artist is merely a student getting an informal,</i><br>

<p>
So are you saying that an "educated" consumer would never be scammed by a<br>
con artist?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can. If a company, like Corel, would sell competetive software that</i><br>

<p>
Maybe Corel is using buggy Microsoft products to compile their code? ;)<br>
