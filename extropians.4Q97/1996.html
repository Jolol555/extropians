Actually we are about to make a change. To post to the Extropians list you<br>
will need to be a member of Extropy Institute, although non-members will be<br>
able to read only.<br>
<p>
I've been too busy with getting the newsletter to post about this change,<br>
but now it's out I will explain the hows and whys, probably today.<br>
<p>
Apart from restricting the list, we are about to open several<br>
special-purpose lists that will also be restricted.<br>
<p>
Look for details of both of these changes here.<br>
