I find it facinating that the predominant discussion centers on statistics <br>
gathered on geographical units that have no relevance to most of us.  How many <br>
of you spend most of your time within geography which correlates closely to <br>
one of the mentioned statistical entities?  The bulk of my time is spent in my <br>
home, neighborhood and workplace.  My individual actions with respect to <br>
firearms are governed by the reality within those georgraphic zones.  I saw <br>
nothing that correlates anywhere closely to those zones in your statistics.  <br>
The murder rate of the United States of America is not relevant to me, even <br>
though I live within its boundaries.  Neither is the murder rate of the <br>
metropolitan area within which I live. <br>
<p>
Far more relevant is acquiring knowlege about the reason that individuals are <br>
killing and when/if it matters.  I personally find even this issue somewhat <br>
boring because I  possess the intellect and the means to avoid high risk <br>
scenarios without feeling geographically constrained.  So do most of the <br>
individuals I know who possess intellects which I value.  <br>
<p>
The greatest hinderance to our pursuit of knowlege and implementation of our <br>
discoveries is not armed thugs but the authorities who restrict our activities <br>
as a rational for protecting us from such thugs.  I might add that the <br>
greatest threats to my safety and longevity also come from the "protectors".  <br>
Your statistics only serve as a pseudo rationale for justifying their <br>
existance.  By using these statistics as a basis for arguing "for" or <br>
"against" you are only legitimizing centralized decision making.<br>
