I spent the past year in graduate school studying the topic of <br>
violence, and I have been following this thread with interest, but I <br>
must confess to some confusion as to the points being made.  Can <br>
someone please address the following:<br>
<p>
(i) just what type of violence is being discussed?  War, assault, <br>
torture, hate crimes, etc?  The literature in recent years has <br>
branched off to address these in singe form, as the complex of <br>
factors that lead to them is different, and some areas are better <br>
understood than others.  (ie, serial killers can be labeled mentally <br>
ill in most cases, but perfectly sane people commit hate crimes)<br>
<p>
(ii) again, I must please beg of you not to immediately cast all <br>
violence into the catagory of neurochemical causes, as to <br>
predetermine that all violence is caused by mental chemical imbalance <br>
automatically shuts off other avenues of dealing with it.<br>
