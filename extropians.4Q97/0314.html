<i>&gt;I think both Delmar England and John Clark have totally missed the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the first part of Greg's post.  That, or they're refusing to follow</i><br>
<i>&gt;his flexible use of "objective". </i><br>
<p>
I follow, but don't accept, because I do not see objective reality flexing<br>
in sync with the *"flexible use of "objective"*, which is necessary for the<br>
language usage to conform to reality. There is language usage that describes<br>
reality; then again, there is language usage that presumes to create it.<br>
Although not necessarily  by conscious intent, this practice is widespread<br>
and usually accepted without question. Given my conclusions and beliefs<br>
regarding language usage, I'm obliged to question. (Details can be found at<br>

Mr. Yudkowsky, I thank you for the response and bringing focus upon<br>
important elements of the discussion . However, I could not help but notice<br>
that you did not addresss the fire and water illustration. This is central<br>
to the issue as it identifies the reference for the meaning of the terms,<br>
good and bad. As pointed out, the question of reference of individual or non<br>
individual casts the issue of "morality" into two entirely different<br>
perspectives. I hope you will provide me with your conclusions and viewpoint<br>
of the illustration and its implications.<br>

<p>
A fine substitution I would say, and not at all flawed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The same religions attach the concept</i><br>

<i>&gt;absolute control over it.</i><br>
<p>
Right, but that's not the end of it. There are many who reject in detail,<br>
then with a label change or two swallow the whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This doesn't mean that the concept of "objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality" is indefeasibly predicated on the existence of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I didn't say it is. I said it is predicated upon the idea of a superior<br>
being not necessarily only the "god" of formal religion. The focal question<br>
is as you have indirectly indicated is whether the concept, morality, has<br>
any definitive basis in ANYTHING existing independently of human individual.<br>
The fire\water example illustrates the conclusion that it does not.<br>
<p>
I hate to get into a dissertation on language, but I feel obliged to<br>
explain, at least briefly, why I don't accept some of your language usage.<br>
We have a circumstance of immutable natual laws that are not influenced by<br>
mind. Let's call this condition, circumstance, whatever, objective reality.<br>
A lot of what you say appears to agree with this conclusion and definition.<br>
An actual definition ALWAYS differentiates. So, although mind itself is an<br>
objective phenomenon, the characteristic of volition, choice, personal<br>
preference, etc, is differentiated from objective by the term, subjective.<br>
In short, definitively, the term, objective, means that which exists<br>
independently of mind, and therefore, is not dismised nor altered by mind,<br>
i.e., by wishes, hopes, beliefs, nor personal preferences. In contrast,<br>
subjective, means that which is dependent upon mind, which is derived from<br>
individual mind, would not exist except for mind. I find this describes,<br>
defines and differiantiates objective from subjective and provides a<br>
reference upon which to make determinations of objective or subjective. <br>
<p>
While original invention or selection of a specific symbol to represent a<br>
specific aspect of reality is arbitrary, if the use of such a specific<br>
symbol is to represent a specific aspect of reality in a true and conforming<br>
fashion, must it not do so consistently lest we lose its reference on which<br>
its definitive meaning depends?  The key and operative term here is<br>
DIFFERENTIATE. That's really the reason there's more than one word in a<br>
language system isn't it. Language usage absent differentiation is mentally<br>
and linguistically the melding of different aspects of mind and matter and<br>
abandonment of definition and connection to reality. Quite often, it is the<br>
melding of subjective and objective without awareness and calling the end<br>
result "objective truth."<br>
<p>
In focus are the terms, objective and subjective with definitive meanings<br>
set forth above. From the definitions, it follows that objective must be<br>
something that mind may discover, but does't not create. In formal religion,<br>
the alleged discovery of "God" fits the criteria of "objective morality",<br>
but is negated because the alleged discovery is myth, i.e., a mental<br>
invention thought to be discovery. Through many and varied forms, this is<br>
really the basis for all claims of "objective morality", though the false<br>
nature of such claimed discoveries is not always as highly visible as the<br>
claim of divinity. Still the motivation, epistemology and psychology are<br>
fundamentally the same.<br>
<p>
Most consciously and emotionally equate the term, objective, with<br>
scientific, true, valid, etc. Combine this with the general underlying<br>
conditioning toward subservience and consequent feeling of need to "validate<br>
by reality" one's personal choices, and presto, the term, objective, is<br>
called in to do "double duty". When convenient, the term, objective is<br>
presented as meaning to exist independently of mind. This provides "absolute<br>
credibility." As the wind shifts to personal values. the term, objective, is<br>
often verbally and emotionally connected to individual mind and subjective<br>
choice - from  which it is originally necessarily detached to provide the<br>
"absolute credibility." To wit: Loss of differentiation and definition;<br>
meaning the usage does not conform to objective reality; meaning not true.<br>
A self-supporting illusion as it were that is dependent on non definition.<br>
(To "save Christianity", Thomas Aquinas, "reconciled reason and faith." This<br>
magic was accomplished by not defining, i.e,, by not connecting either term<br>
to the objective reality. To my dismay, this practice has not changed over<br>
the centuries and is much in evidence in this day.)<br>
<p>
(To evaluate objectively is to determine what is AS IS independently of<br>
one's personal valuations. Since no one is infallible, the everpresent<br>
question is whether one does or does not succeed in such efforts. ) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Likewise, religions state that their morality is objective and that God gets</i><br>
<i>&gt;to define objective morality.  This does not mean that objective morality</i><br>
<i>&gt;requires a God; it means that the religion in question thinks so.</i><br>
<p>
In formal religion, how many thousands of denomination labels exist implying<br>
difference in beliefs. If we ignore the facade variations and go to the<br>
directive radical of each, what do we find?  They're all the same! The<br>
common denominator, regardless of label and claims of difference, is the<br>
subordination of human individual to an expressed and\or implied superior<br>
being. This is the actual definition of religion, per se. By reference to<br>
this actual definition, does it not logically follow that any belief system<br>
that expresses or implies a human individual as subordinated property of a<br>
non human superior being is no less religion than the formal variety? (Its<br>
not the subjective label on a bottle of lethal poison that will kill you.<br>
Its the objective content. - And you're no less dead if the label reads<br>
"Health Elixer").<br>
<p>
What of the phrases, "values of society", "public welfare", "national<br>
interest", "government does", as only four of a horrendously long list of<br>
concepts that express and\or imply the subordination of individual to a<br>
superior being? Separation of church and state?  Quite a joke.  How does<br>
"state" exist except by thought and action treating "State" as a volitional,<br>
valuing, acting, supreme god to which each and every individual is subordinated?<br>
<p>
Like formal religion, governmental systems come under a wide assortment of<br>
labels implying a fundamental difference which doesn't exist. To be sure,<br>
there are surface differences in political form, and method of<br>
implementation, but at the nitty gritty definitive radical level,<br>
"government" is simply a synonymn for initiation of force and coercion. The<br>
initiation of force and coercion may be politicized,organized, centralized,<br>
and canonized, but the subjective labels and arbitrary claims do not erase<br>
the root meaning of the term, nor the destruction that is certain to be<br>
derived from the practice. One of the points that I'm trying to make here is<br>
that when I say the concept, objective morality, depends on the concept,<br>
superior being, I am not saying that it will be highly visible, nor<br>
recognized by most, nor admitted for it may not be of a conscious<br>
designation. However, if we eliminate human individual as the basis for<br>
"objective morality", what logically remains except a volitional, valuing<br>
superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that<br>
something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external<br>
"something" volitional thing to create an "objective morality?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The concept,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; morality, itself presumes to set an alleged natural standard, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thus presumes to displace individual preference. This is the root</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; premise of subordination and rule. If peace and harmony is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; goal sought, this belief system is bad news.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The key fallacy is not the assumed existence of objective morality, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt;your particular morality is objective.</i><br>
<p>
The latter claim does not come about EXCEPT by the initial fallacy,<br>
objective morality. (And I don't claim "objective morality", or any other<br>
variant of the illusion.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Science is the middle path between the harsh tyranny of unquestionable "truth"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the useless undisprovability of "subjective" reality.</i><br>
<p>
Huh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Science states that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there exists an objective reality, but we do not know what it is.  My ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;system makes the same statement with respect to morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The first statement presumes to grasp objective reality as a whole in<br>
contradiction of a mind's requirement for limitation and difference; so, of<br>
course, "we do not know what it is", for none can grasp infinity. As for<br>
claiming to know that "morality" exists, but not knowing what it is, this<br>
seems to indicate that the alleged "objective morality" is not derived from<br>
an explainable differentiated aspects of an objective reality, but rather a<br>
feeling whose origin and cause in not necessarily derived from any fact at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In the real world of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individual and subjective value, the term value always asks the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; question: value to whom for what purpose. Value is not something</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; existing independently of individual and inherent in a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; circumstance. To speak definitively of value is to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; someone ATTRIBUTES value to a thing or circumstance, a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; conditions as it were. If an individual attributes value to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; particular goal, desires a particular set of circumstances, how</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; can this valuation be subjected to the determination as right or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wrong? Can it be evaluated as means to itself?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;May I paraphrase?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Any 'rational' goal is simply a rational means to some other, not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;justified goal.  Therefore, there are no 'inherently rational' goals.  All</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from</i><br>
<i>&gt;value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I don't mind paraphrasing IF it stays with the program. I'm afraid your's<br>
doesn't. The first thing you throw in is the term, rational, qualifying the<br>
concept, goal. This is neither expressed nor implied in my assertions. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This logic is absolutely irrefutable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem is that it's wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If anyone ever figures out why, their name will live forever.</i><br>
<p>
"Natural paradox" is a euphemism for contradiction denied. The dilemma in<br>
focus is of your own creating. <br>
<p>
By volitional nature, an individual seeks goals, period. This talk about<br>
rational and irrational is just subjective value judgment stuff thrown in<br>
with the belief and pretense that the call is made from objective criteria.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from</i><br>
<i>&gt;value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Aside from the contradiction, objective value,  I see a lot of goals here,<br>
but no means. Combine this omission with the fallacy, objective value, and<br>
its little wonder you find the problem unresolvable.  Fact does not serve to<br>
validate fiction.  Once again, definition, comes to the rescue.<br>
<p>
First question, what is a goal? If an actual definition conforms to<br>
objective reality, it logically follows that an actual definition is also<br>
100% consistent in time and application. So what fits to define the term<br>
goal? How about: A goal is a desire to exchange one set of circumstances for<br>
a different set of circumstances. Will that get it?<br>
<p>
Every day and all day, you and every conscious functioning individual<br>
continually pursue and achieve goals. This is not always of a consciouss<br>
nature, but it is no less pursuit of and achieving goals. It is only when<br>
focus is required that one is inclined to name a goal. What set of<br>
circustances you name as a goal is arbitrary. The means to achieve it are<br>
not. Suppose you desire to quench your thirst. Possible means is you getting<br>
a drink of water by your own direct efforts, or having someone bring it to<br>
you. While there is no objective right or wrong regarding your choice to<br>
quench your thirst, there are objective requirements to achieve this end.<br>
They are called means.<br>
<p>
Suppose you desire to live. Since you are already alive, this is not a goal.<br>
Means are what you seek to sustain the value of life held. Again, there is<br>
no right or wrong regarding your choice to value life, but there are<br>
objective requirements to sustain the value held. Goals do not turn into<br>
other goals, nor does means turn into goals. There is cause and effect, but<br>
the concept, goal, is a matter of personal preference and arbitrariry<br>
designation as to what set of circumstances you wish to come about. Whatever<br>
the objective circumstance or potential objective circumstance, attributing<br>
value is still and always a matter of subjective preference not subject to<br>
proof or disproof as right or wrong. <br>
To put it another way, to attribute value to a real or potential objective<br>
circumstance does not make the objective circumstance an "objective value."<br>
It is still an objective circumstance whether you value it or not. It has no<br>
value or purpose in itself. If it did, the value and purpose would still<br>
exist if there were no one on earth. The objective circumstance is objective<br>
(existing independently of mind). Your attributing value to it is subjective<br>
(dependent upon mind). Clear?<br>
<p>
In literally every claim of "objective value" I have encountered apart from<br>
the formal religion variety which openly claims "God" as "objective value"<br>
cause, the claimant manages to bring in a personal value and pretend that it<br>
is objective discovery. Some, like Rand, go to great lengths to "prove" this<br>
discovery. The "ought from is" fantasy. Others just toss it in without so<br>
much as a by your leave. Once the personal value is enthroned, the focus<br>
shifts to means to achieve it. The problem is, those that insert their<br>
personal prefernce and call it objective make no distinction between ends<br>
and means, the former being a matter of subjective choice; the latter being<br>
a matter of objective criteria. Contrary to much popular language usage,<br>
ends and means are not the same. The former is ALWAYS subjective. The latter<br>
is ALWAYS objective.<br>
