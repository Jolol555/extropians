G'day,<br>
	the following piece is a small work of science fiction exploring<br>
the interiority or point-of-view of a character called  *rajer* who lives<br>
aheads of us 'in' or 'on' the singularity or spike, or plateau of a sigmoid<br>
curve if it aint all that singular.<br>
	Spending a little time reading it (and I see some of you don't get<br>
get out much) it should (hopefully) be self-extracting. And though it<br>
obviously is (might be) outside your reading comfort zones, it won't load a<br>
virus into your sense of self and eat your mind, or even brain.<br>
	This piece is a sequel to one written in 1987 entitled _child<br>
rajer_. They are both 'dumps from diary entries'.<br>
	_child rajer_ appears around the place on various list archives.<br>
	I hope _ad rajer, spikechild_ will provoke comment, and or inform<br>
your work. If you want a copy of _child rajer_ (its quite long) send me an<br>
email.<br>
	Regards,<br>
