Hypnotised?  Didn't you notice the somewhat... sceptical... tone to my post?<br>

Mr Randi is a fun guy, with his heart in the right place (and of course<br>
I've read FLIM FLAM), but while he's an excellent prestidigitator he's<br>
pretty awful at add-ups.  My book THE LOTTO EFFECT spends a page or two<br>
pulling apart his feeble attempts to mock a standard parapsychology paper.<br>
He got elementary probabilities wrong.  Some time back I found Mr Randi's<br>
email @ and sent him a copy of this passage.  He kindly responded, but<br>
ducked and evaded the matter of his errors.  In essence, he bitched and<br>
moaned at my  boringly insisting on talking about *that* kind of minor<br>
detail, since his great achievement had been to show that Geller (Geller?<br>
who's talking about Geller here?!) was a scamster.  Wow!  Perhaps he also<br>
proved that the earth is not flat.  I was not impressed.<br>
