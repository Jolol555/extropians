Good point!  I tend to agree.  How would one know there was a tree<br>
or a neural structure or a correlation without some awareness of the<br>
external world.  The problem I see here is that we need to integrate<br>
the external/causal view of mind with the internal/phenomenological<br>
one.  The two are not opposites, but part of a seamless whole.  One<br>
cannot be aware of something without a means of awareness.  And<br>
just because one is aware by a specific means does not invalidate<br>
one's awareness.<br>
