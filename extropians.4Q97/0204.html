<p>
I didn't think much about it till I got involved with this company that<br>
is trapped in Corel Ventura. I've had more corrupted files, access<br>
violations, lockups, you name it, in the past two months than in my<br>
previous 7 years working with computers. Just today, I tried to use<br>
Ventura's "publish to HTML" function. It froze up a half dozen times<br>
while half way through the job of converting a software manual into a<br>
website. I finally got a halfway decent output without crashing on the<br>
seventh try. It took setting the virtual memory at a fixed 300 megs to<br>
do it, and it still took an hour to process.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Absent actual physical coercion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is a hypnotic or subliminal advertisement "physical coercion"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I personally think so, while others here do not. it could be said that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your volunteering to expose yourself to subliminal coercion by using</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; media sources that employ them is your own waiver of caveat emptor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well I definitely do not agree with the "others."  What if your property</i><br>
<i>&gt; is surrounded by a bunch of hired hypnotists from Coke swinging</i><br>
<i>&gt; pendulums and chanting "drink coke, drink coke" (OK, that's kind of silly)</i><br>
<i>&gt; But still, if people own all the property around you, and you just happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; to look out your window... I think you have been physically coerced.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; only defense I can see for this in an anarcho-capitalistic society is for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some consumer organization to monitor companies that practice coercion and</i><br>
<i>&gt; organized massive buoycotts.  Still, if Coke can hypnotize enough people,</i><br>
<i>&gt; why would they care about a buoycott?  Maybe the consumer organization</i><br>
<i>&gt; should take more drastic action in this case...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see an anarcho-capitalist society as being a bit violent, but certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; more interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Its all a matter of using your own means of self defense, or a hired<br>
PPL, to enforce your own sense of personal space and personal property.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; What benefit are con artists to their victims?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A victim of a con artist is merely a student getting an informal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; involuntary, education that they obviously need very badly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So are you saying that an "educated" consumer would never be scammed by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; con artist?</i><br>
<p>
Pretty much, but its all relative, really. I'm pretty good at seeing<br>
through most scams that people try to pull on me, but its only since<br>
I've been conned enough to the point where I make it a point to be on<br>
the lookout, looking for the catch.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be an example of positive feedback: the more people have Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; (which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I can. If a company, like Corel, would sell competetive software that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wasn't even more bug infested than Microsoft applications.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe Corel is using buggy Microsoft products to compile their code? ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I dunno, maybe since I'm on an American machine, it doesn't understand<br>
line calls that end in "eh?"<br>
