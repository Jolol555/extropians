I enjoyed WIRED 6.01 quite a lot, but I found it really annoying in places<br>
too.  In some ways the issue took on the flavor of extropianism in its<br>
most caricaturable, extropianism in its least thoughtful aspects. It<br>
should go without saying that CHANGE IS GOOD paints with strokes too broad<br>
to make a workable slogan for transhumanism.  Changes can be bad.  What is<br>
wanted is Foresight...  And championing foresight is the more necessary<br>
theme for an extropianism that makes a positive difference in the kind of<br>
future we get.  What is wanted after all are *profitable* changes.<br>
Dissolution is a change.  Entropy is change as much as extropy is. <br>
<p>
I found Postrel's article to be one of the most infuriating of the<br>
collection.  She quotes Arthur Schlesinger as writing that the computer<br>
and internet revolutions turn "the untrammeled market into a global<br>
juggernaut, crashing across frontiers, enfeebling national powers of<br>
taxation and regulation, undercutting national management of interest<br>
rates and exchange rates, widening disparities of wealth between and<br>
within nations, dragging down labor standards, degrading the environment,<br>
denying nations the shaping of their own economic destiny, creating a<br>
world economy without a world polity."  I don't mean to argue basics here,<br>
to suggest that Schlesinger's specific fears aren't misguided ones, but do<br>
we really want to deny that changes of extraordinary magnitude are going<br>
down and that it may be useful to talk about them and even engineer their<br>
flow here and there to bring about the best results we can manage? Postrel<br>
goes on to distinguish what she calls "stasists" from "dynamists", those<br>
who shrink from change as opposed to those who seek change, and drawing<br>
the ideological battle lines here seems to me to encourage a<br>
thoughtlessness in the face of the future that is reckless and hopeless. <br>
