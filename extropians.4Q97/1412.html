<p>
This is not quite what I mean by a copy.  I want my copy to have real-time<br>
updates of my current mental state.  It's not good enough if a copy was<br>
made a few minutes ago and now I am faced with some problem.  Likewise<br>
there is no way that I can be a slave and my "copy" be free, because<br>
obviously his mental state does not match mine.<br>
<p>
Instead, let me go to sleep, render me unconscious, make a copy,<br>
and destroy the original, letting the copy awaken.  Now there is no<br>
experience which the original has that the copy does not share.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you not try to avoid physical pain because it had been explained</i><br>
<i>&gt; to you that "you" (your copy) still exists without pain?  Would you take</i><br>
<i>&gt; a cut in pay as long as "you" (your copy) still received a full salary? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would you become celibate and nonjealous, happy in the knowledge that</i><br>
<i>&gt; "you" (your copy) is now having a long-term sexual relationship with</i><br>
<i>&gt; your spouse?  Is not death merely the ultimate inconvenience, permanent</i><br>
<i>&gt; pain, or permanent lack of pleasure?  Would you really not mind being</i><br>
<i>&gt; killed, just because you are assured that "you" (your copy) will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowed to live?</i><br>
<p>
I would not do any of these things, except possibly the last one, and<br>
only in the kind of situation described above.  Only in that case is there<br>
the practical possibility of having the copy be an exact mental duplicate<br>
of the original.  In all the others, the copy and original diverge, and<br>
there is no longer a copy of the person who is having the bad situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see these examples as similar questions on a continuum.  I'm not sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; why that last one would be any different than the former ones.  I still</i><br>
<i>&gt; see the original as trying to avoid pain, gain pleasure, and avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; death.  Knowledge of what some other body is experiencing that I am not</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiencing does not influence my desires for the future.</i><br>
<p>
Hopefully my explanation will have clarified this.  I agree with this part,<br>
but the problem is not that copies don't share identity, it's that the<br>
copies are not being kept identical and hence that identity is no longer<br>
shared.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your other examples are all very good.  They all are different ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; expressing the same copying example, and they all have the same problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; for me.  They require copying, the creation of a dupliate, and then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; destruction of the original afterwards or simultaneously.  As long as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am still experiencing myself inside the original, about to suffer that</i><br>
<i>&gt; destruction, I don't see the advantage in having some distant copy that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am merely told exists.</i><br>
<p>
So how do you view the upload examples?  Imagine yourself an upload.<br>
Do you consider yourself to have died if your program is:<br>
<p>
	- Paused for a moment?<br>
	- Saved to disk and reloaded?<br>
	- Saved to disk and reloaded to a different computer?<br>
	- Suspended, sent across a network, and restarted on a different set<br>
	  of network nodes?<br>
