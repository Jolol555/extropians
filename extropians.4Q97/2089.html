I heartily agree that the 2 list scenario is the best of both worlds (because it<br>
allows for both worlds).  I do VOTE YES for this idea.  Additional services e.g.<br>
those I mentioned in "Re: SNR" may be useful as well. The text of "re: SNR" is<br>
reprinted below:<br>
I feel that most intelligent people who have a lot to contribute probably find<br>
it an excessive waste of<br>
time to wade through so many postings.  Therefore, I suggest that all those who<br>
post should be<br>
Extropy Institute (EI) members.  I do not believe that basic EI membership<br>
should have a price tag<br>
though. Another electronic community that I am a member of (the HTML Writer's<br>
Guild at<br>
<a href="http://www.hwg.org">http://www.hwg.org</a>.) has several levels of membership but basic membership is<br>
free.  In this way<br>
those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can subscribe to a<br>
print copy magazine<br>
(sort of like Web Magazine), other services, get a plaque (ala Public<br>
Television) or whatever. A live<br>
chat room for Level 2 members, for example might be set up.  An archive of the<br>
most popular<br>
threads could be available for Level 3.  A member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or<br>
online by<br>
access number) is possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list<br>
but would be paid for<br>
by the members who desire such services.  It's a thought worth serious thought.<br>
Maybe a vote of<br>
sorts could be taken.  Who would I contact about this plebiscite notion?<br>
