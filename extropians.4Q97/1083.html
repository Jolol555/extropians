I've gotten first hand experience with this. I have implemented a few<br>
Linux boxen here at work, and it's an uphill battle. The suits only<br>
care about appearances, and a production box running 'shareware' in a<br>
$3bil/yr company is verboten.<br>

<p>
I agree. The strides made in the OS in recent months are quite<br>
impressive. It does run better on Sparcs than Solaris does. Dont even<br>
mention DEC Unix. Oracle has had a Linux port for over a year, but<br>
refuse to sell it. They dont see a 'Market'. Today, it's the best<br>
place to do DNS, Web, and Mail. (OK, that's a bit of a personal<br>
opinion creeping in there.) <br>
