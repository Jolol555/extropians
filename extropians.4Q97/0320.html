M.Lorrey scripsit:<br>
: Sorry, I thought a list of historical precedent would be sufficient<br>
: argument. Ok, maybe not. How about this: Can any socialist in the<br>
: audience please tell me why they think government spends money better<br>
: than private industry, when public debt must be given tax exempt status<br>
: in order to attract sufficient investment to purchase that debt, while<br>
: stocks in private corporations, the largest 40 of which have an average<br>
: annual growth rate twice that of the rate of return on public debt<br>
: instruments. If government was so much better, then Government bonds<br>
: would give a higher rate of return without tax exempt status.<br>
:<br>
: I think the rate of return on investment is possibly the best yardstick<br>
: one can measure the relative performance of public vs. private sectors.<br>
<p>
Good grief, Michael, any fool can tell you that earning money<br>
isn't what the gummint is for.  Where's the return on investment<br>
in public goods?  Nowhere, because the provider of public goods<br>
doesn't *get paid* !  That's *why* (in theory) we pay taxes, to<br>
fund such things!<br>
<p>
Now maybe you mean that if the state spends wisely, the economy<br>
will grow, and tax revenues will grow.  If that's what you meant,<br>
do say it more explicitly, because I almost missed it.<br>
<p>
: In terms of how well consumers are treated by product or service<br>
: providers, perhaps we can use yardsticks like:<br>
: a) what is the relative accident rate in automobiles between the US and<br>
: former Soviet Union (in accidents/fatalities per vehicle)?<br>
	[etc]<br>
<p>
That's better.<br>
<p>
: Some other questions to ask:<br>
:<br>
: How many people have been shot and killed in their beds<br>
: by hit squads hired by the mom and pop store down the street<br>
: (including New York City, I'll be daring)?<br>
<p>
Hm, there ought to be a story in that.  Perhaps a black-comic<br>
movie, in the vein of "No Way To Treat A Lady".<br>
