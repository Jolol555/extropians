I've kept quiet on this mailing list for awhile,  but I couldn't resist<br>
this tempting question.<br>
<p>
I won't dance around the question, trying to be cute by "thinking outside<br>
the box".  I feel that it's a fairly straight forward question and deserves<br>
a fairly straight-forward answer.<br>
<p>
I believe the most important change that I'd make would have to do with<br>
self-expression in public,  especially concerning children.  I've just left<br>
an environment where children were really not allowed to express themselves<br>
fully without the constant fear of peer-rejection and authoritative<br>
disapproval.  Being that the future of humanity rests in children,  such as<br>
myself,  I hate to see them being bound and limited in their behavior and<br>
thinking.<br>
<p>
Of course individual civil rights would play a large role in saying when<br>
too much self-expression is at hand... who am I to say when enough is<br>
enough?  This personal indecisiveness will probably take away from my main<br>
point,  but I thought it was important to add that there will always be<br>
limitations to socially-acceptable expressionism.<br>
<p>
That's enough for now... but as for us being "tested",  I make it a point<br>
never to trust anyone using anonymous e-mail... After all, I've got a<br>
hotmail account as well. ;]<br>
