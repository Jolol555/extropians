Subject: Silva method<br>
<p>
Does anyone on the list know anything about the Silva method? I have found<br>
plenty of their own claims and advertisements (www.silvaintl.com, among<br>
many others) but haven't been able to find any critiques.  URLs, magazine<br>
articles, books?<br>
<p>
I ask because a friend of mine, very close but unfortunately very<br>
sentimental and insufficiently skeptical, is convinced of the method's<br>
efficacy.  He claims that he has been able to learn a lot of useful,<br>
non-supernatural abilities such as waking up without an alarm <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
I can somtimes do that minus four minutes.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
and going to<br>
sleep on cue, <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
Self controled narcolepsy?<br>
It's a good time saver.<br>
I'm pretty good at meditation;<br>
I've made my pulse repeatedly fluctuate from 136 to 115 bpm and back by will;<br>
it took about 5 seconds in either direction up or down<br>
(I got bored in a hospital :-).<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
enhanced concentration,<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
I once contentrated on a wall trying not to move for 45 minutes<br>
and blinked less than 170 times.<br>
A biology class was going on at the time.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 etc.  This I am prepared to accept.<br>
He also claims that he and other participants of the classes can perform a<br>
diagnosis by looking at a picture.  Naturally he had an emotional account<br>
of how one of the other Silva students focused on a picture of his<br>
grandmother (or may just her name; I forget) and came up with pancreatic<br>
cancer. <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
Don't you believe in visual diagnosis?<br>
There are many signals to use:<br>
hair color, hair thickness, baldness, wrinkles, pallor, vericose veins, <br>
liverspots, acne, moles, bloodshot eyes, black eyes, sunken eyes, <br>
muscle tone, bone stucture, clothes, habits, etc.<br>
Know what causes what, <br>
apply some statistical analysis to determine probability of the cause<br>
and you have an idea of their medical profile.<br>
<p>
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer?<br>
Learn them, then look at that picture. ;-)<br>
<p>
Is anyone here good at prognostication?<br>
I've been wanting to learn more.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<p>
 My god, that's what she has!  He further claims the diagnosis<br>
was not arrived at by a "warm... warmer... hot..." line of guessing.  I<br>
don't buy it, but it's hard to tell a friend "You're deluding yourself."<br>
He's also seen ghosts...<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
Seeing things is VERY common.<br>
Proving they were ghosts is TOUGH.<br>
