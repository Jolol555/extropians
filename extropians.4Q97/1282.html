I consider this discussion to be very much on-topic. We are in effect<br>
discussing the very core of intelligence and reality, and machine<br>
versus non-machine intelligence, all as currently understood by<br>
humans. This is essential to the feasibility of uploading and<br>
computer-based intelligence.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; How am I supposed to go from this to Penrose's conclusion? Sounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crazy to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would be better for someone who is more familiar with Penrose's argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; to say whether I have accurately described it.  However I think the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; here is that we aren't supposed to be just playing with formal systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; when we do math.  We are seeking after truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The mathematics we create is intended to accurately represent the</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior of abstract mathematical objects which we are thinking of,</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as the points and lines of plane geometry, or the integers under</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rules of arithmetic.  We set up axioms which are intended to</i><br>
<i>&gt; caputre all the relevant properties of these objects.  "Truth" in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; context means that the axioms accurately describe the mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; objects we have in mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We have to go outside the axiomatic system to determine the truth of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposed axiom.  We have to fall back on our general reasoning power,</i><br>
<i>&gt; persuasive arguments, looking at the conclusions which flow from different</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumptions, and seeing if they seem plausible.  It's almost more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; political argument than the kind of logic we associate with mathematics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I just skimmed Penrose's book, but my impression is that he claims that</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematicians have an instinctive ability to recognize mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth.  Machines, which are deterministic computer programs and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be in principle be described as formal systems, are limited by Godel's</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorem and are unable to recognize certain truths.  Since people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; (according to Penrose) unlimited in their ability to recognize mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof, this would mean that they are not formal systems and therefore no</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine can do mathematics in the way a person does.  (And hence, among</i><br>
<i>&gt; other things, uploading and AI are impossible.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the case of the CH, as I quoted from Rucker's book there has not been</i><br>
<i>&gt; a killer argument made either way.  It could be that our understanding of</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinities is so poor that choosing the axiom one way or the other will</i><br>
<i>&gt; both produce mathematics which seems OK.  The properties of the infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; objects will be different, but either one could fit into our sloppy</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental model of how an infinite object should behave.  If so this would</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to contradict Penrose's premise.</i><br>

Indeed, this is hardly the first time this has come up. The "parallel<br>
postulate"<br>
was in the same situation at one time that you describe for the CH<br>
today.<br>
Mathematicians tried to show that the parallel postulate could be proven<br>
from Euclid's other postulates, and failed. The result was the discovery<br>
of non-euclidian geometries in which the paralel postulate does not<br>
hold.<br>
We now commonly describe the "true geometry of the universe" as being<br>
non-euclidean. IMO this constitutes a dramatic counterexample to<br>
Penrose's<br>
idea that humans have an instinct for mathematical truth, unless we wish<br>
to believe the instinct is less than 500 years old.<br>
