<p>
We do not agree with it but we do _respect_ his concern, otherwise we would<br>
not be having this discussion.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Extropians like to put "ex" infront of many words.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;No one owns the letters "ex".</i><br>
<p>
I hope not, there's only 24 other letters.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;No one owns meaning of the letters "ex".</i><br>
<p>
Unless it is an internationally registered trademark (I think).<br>
Tom suggested AltaVita for us, nice name (really!) but we could be mistaken<br>
for a famous search-engine (would be good to get the hit-rate up though, al<br>
those people making a mistake typing...)<br>

If somebody owns 'Ex', you just went broke.<br>
<p>
I can only hope that Exxon has nore inadvertend oilspills, that would ve<br>
very bad for all of us wouldn't it? ;-)<br>
<p>
Mike, thanks for putting the importance of this (or lack thereof) in<br>
perspective, maybe we got carried away a little... you know youthful<br>
enthousiasm and all that ;-). I won't say 'they started it' because if<br>
'they' did, we allowed it to continue which is just as bad.<br>
<p>
