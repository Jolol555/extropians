I agree. While I've been delaying my subscription/membership this year<br>
due to vagaries in time/employment, etc... I am rather appalled at the<br>
elitist attitude some list subscribers are taking with regards to the<br>
list. So we have some newbies now and then, so we get spammed once in a<br>
while. If I were the powers that be, I'd keep the main list open and<br>
have higher level specialized lists for those who don't want to have<br>
their in boxes polluted by the tracks of ignorant plebes. Its not the<br>
cost that implies the "cult" flavor, its the isolationist attitude.<br>
Those who don't want to be bothered with helping enlighten newbies to<br>
extropianism shouldn't have kept their subscription when the list went<br>
public.<br>
<p>
Here's an interim suggestion: Have a free subscription period, of say 3,<br>
6 or 12 months. Then have a subscription rate for further membership to<br>
the list.<br>
<p>
Max should have booted me a long time ago, to be fair. (The check is in<br>
the mail). ;)<br>
<p>
For those that complain about too much noise and too little substance,<br>
you should be pushing the list owners to police relevancy/ongoing<br>
stupidity more effectively. Subscribers should also police themselves.<br>
If you think someone is not on topic, first a) check the FAQ yourself,<br>
then b) email the relevant text in the FAQ to the offender.<br>
<p>
Many people here who are ardent libertarians seem to be rather welfarish<br>
in their attitude toward noise/signal on the list. If you think someone<br>
is an ingnorant nincompoop, use personal email to go into long and<br>
sufficient detail to educate the novice as to his or her error. THose<br>
who are too stubbornly newbie for it to have any effect on usually dig<br>
themselves deep enough for some real fun once they get into rude enough<br>
territory. If you are not taking personal responsibility for fixing up<br>
the signal to noise on the list, then its your fault. I find the threat<br>
of high subscription rates simply the moral equivalent of trade<br>
restrictions. Hardly libertarian.<br>
