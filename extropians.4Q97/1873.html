<i>&gt; It's an entry in a database; tomato.red = TRUE. Everything you see</i><br>
<i>&gt; around you is just a database, and Dennett goes to great lengths to</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate this. This is why human perception is so easily fooled,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and why hallucinations may well change a tomato into an elephant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than swapping around bits of the visual field.</i><br>
<p>
	In spite of his arguments, Dennett's eliminative materialist<br>
position is not very popular.<br>
<p>
	When I see a juicy red strawberry, there is something very<br>
phenomenally real and 3 dimensional built out of qualia in my<br>
conscious mind that is representing this package of sugar in my hand.<br>
Though this representation is, in a way, data, there is no<br>
strawberry.red = TRUE.  There is a red phenomenon that represents the<br>
fact that this package reflects 700nm light.  My percept of a<br>
strawberry just is.  There is no high/low level interpretation of the<br>
representation of the strawberry required like interpretaion of<br>
abstract data is required.  It just is my perception of the<br>
strawberry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's a database entry "really fundamentally and phenomenally</i><br>
<i>&gt; like"?</i><br>
<p>
	By definition, abstract data representations ignore the actual<br>
fundamental qualities.  Typically they are fundamentally the<br>
orientation of magnetic flux on a disk.  At the fundamental level this<br>
is what abstract models are built out of.  But of course you could use<br>
punched paper to represent the same "abstract" information even though<br>
it is fundamentally very different.  This is the meaning of<br>
"abstract".  It is one physical phenomenon being set up to model or<br>
represent something else or some other phenomenon.<br>
<p>
	Red is fundamentally not anything like 700 nm light.  It's<br>
phenomenal qualities only abstractly represent what light is like.  It<br>
is one phenomenon modeling another.  It is conscious knowledge about<br>
something.  It is so much more than a particular bit being interpreted<br>
as the red bit being true.  It is red, no interpretation required.<br>
