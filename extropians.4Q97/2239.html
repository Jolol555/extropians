The understanding I have read from various books such as those by Kip thorne,<br>
Michio Kaku and a bunch of others is that the limiting factor for velocity is<br>
the geometry of space-time. Nothing can travel in a perfectly straight line<br>
because space and time (space-time) in higher dimensional geometry is bent,<br>
curved or "warped" by large bodies of mass/energy such as stars and planets.<br>
The orbits of the planets, asteroids and comets around our sun for example are<br>
due to the warping or bending of space-time into "grooves called "worldlines" by<br>
physicists.  Black holes have a massive amount of mass/energy in nearly<br>
infinitesimally small space causing maximal warping of space-time upon itself so<br>
that it pinches itself off from the rest of the universe.  This curious property<br>
is what Kip Thorne used in theoretical work to create a wormhole. A wormhole is<br>
just 2 black holes (or a black hole and its corresponding white hole, (which is<br>
which is of course relative to the position of the observer).  Because the<br>
geometric constraint has been circumvented by the remarkable anomaly of black<br>
holes, the "light barrier" or "geometric barrier" can then be superseded by<br>
superliminal velocities.  Such black holes could connect distant parts of the<br>
universe, possibly various universes that are related by the Wave Function of<br>
the Universe described by Stephen Hawking and connect various time periods (past<br>
and future) of our universe(s) that are tied together by this Wave Function  The<br>
moment before the Big Bang was the entire universe as a singularity aka black<br>
hole and thus the entire universe and its relationship to similar and dissimilar<br>
universes is ruled by the dominance of quantum mechanics at such<br>
atomic/subatomic scales which is why the universe must be quantize into the Wave<br>
Function of the Universe mentioned above<br>

<P>they say nothing travels faster than the speed of light, but what about
when
<BR>light comes near a black hole and it sucks it in, doesnt the light
