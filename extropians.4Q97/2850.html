WEAPONRY AS A REPRESENTATION OF ENTROPIC MEMES<br>
by Kathryn Aegis<br>
<p>
This essay will explain more fully my thoughts regarding the subject<br>
of weaponry as it relates to transhumanist and Extropian endeavors. <br>
The depth of my reaction to Anton's posting shows that an exp<br>
lanation of my perspective on this topic is in order.  Anton has<br>
already stated that the tone of his posting was not appropriate for<br>
this list, and I, in turn, say that my outburst did little to<br>
elevate the level of conversation on the topic.  I also mis took my<br>
own frustration at a memetic blockage for anger.  Others mistook<br>
that frustration for blind committment to a cause, but transhumanist<br>
thought has never been a cause, and I don't agree with it being<br>
labeled a movement.  Sometimes a movement provides a convenient<br>
framework within which to form coalitions and find networks to work<br>
to break out of limitations.  But movements also imply ideol ogy, and<br>
ideology imposes its own restrictions. <br>
<p>
In his second posting, Anton listed his carefully-considered reasons<br>
for owning a gun and his contention that those reasons are extropic.<br>
 No one on this list would suggest that ownership of a gun sh ould in<br>
any way be restricted by a government entity or removed from the<br>
rubric of personal choice.  On the other hand, if he states that his<br>
reasons for making this choice are extropic, then by logi cal<br>
extension other members of this list are allowed the floor to state<br>
that they disagree.  The subject of guns has become so politicized<br>
that to state any sort opinion on it often leads to the list eners<br>
[compartmentalizing] the speaker into one of two ideological and<br>
opposed camps--'gun nuts' and 'peace freaks.'  Extropian thought,<br>
however, provides a more neutral framework within which to con sider<br>
the topic.  <br>
<p>
My own credentials on the topic are both experiential and<br>
research-based.  About ten years ago, a certain network of domestic<br>
terrorists moved into my city, headquartered themselves here, and<br>
proceed ed to attack women and women's reproductive health clinics. <br>
They were armed to the gills with money from the religious right and<br>
military equipment from supremecist groups.  A coalition of<br>
activists and community members formed to respond to this wave of<br>
violence.  We all agreed, as did our local and federal law<br>
enforcement, that to respond with armament tactics would only worsen<br>
the situation. My role in this effort was to design tactics and train<br>
volunteers, and I spent hundreds of hours in field work, observation<br>
and discussion with weapons experts, security experts, martial arts<br>
trainers, and even militia.  I left after seven years of this work,<br>
as staying up all hours of the night every week took a toll on my<br>
health, but by then the tide had turned in our favor.  We now share<br>
information and training on the internet as part of a nationwide<br>
network to combat the violence as it spreads to other cities.<br>
<p>
The level of respect and patience accorded to me by these people<br>
always amazed me, and their lessons remain with me to this day.  A<br>
core lesson taken was a basic one in the psychology of persons who<br>
engage in the use of weapons, which I have come to think of as a<br>
source of entropy.  In devising counter-tactics, we were encouraged<br>
to utilize the single-track mode of thinking in which a human<br>
engages upon picking up a weapon.  Over and over again, we were told<br>
that our greatest weapon was the ability of the brain to devise<br>
multiple solutions to problems, and that the person holding the gun<br>
ha s probably placed all of their reliance and expectations on the<br>
piece of metal in their hand.  Fast and easy solutions rarely exist<br>
in a violent situation;  often you will have to try several methods<br>
of dealing with it before experiencing success.  <br>
<p>
Therefore, to extend that lesson, it is not gun ownership per se<br>
that seems entropic to me, but rather a single-track focus on guns<br>
as a superior means for achieving certain goals, with the swift dis<br>
missal of proposed or proven alternatives.   As we move into a time<br>
in which the exponential elongation of life finally becomes a<br>
possibility, the subject of how we protect it or end it deserves<br>
more serious consideration.  We have over two thousand years of data<br>
as to the effects of the continued usage of overt violence as a<br>
solution to human conflict--do we really want to plan for several<br>
more millenia of the same?<br>
<p>
Extropians maintain that one of the primary methods by which humans<br>
will achieve further evolution is the development of increasingly<br>
sophisticated tools.  And humans have devised ever more increasin gly<br>
complex gun weaponry.  But another method by which further evolution<br>
will be achieved is through creative thought and invention--thinking<br>
outside of the box.  On a functional level, a gun can be viewed as a<br>
tool comprised of a hollow tube and a mechanism that shoots<br>
projectiles, much as a fountain pen can be described as a hollow<br>
tube that shoots ink, or a rocket ship as a hollow tube that s hoots<br>
itself through the atmosphere.  Use of these implements can be<br>
considered an engineering problem, with the counter of more<br>
sophisticated tools.<br>
<p>
On another level, the use to which these mechanical tools are put<br>
leads to the inanimate tools being imbued with humanist moral<br>
characteristics.  Fountain pens are considered 'good' because of<br>
their beauty and use in literary endeavors.  Rocket ships are 'good'<br>
because they take humans into new realms of exploration.  Guns are<br>
viewed as 'good' or 'bad' depending on whether they are utilized for<br>
defense or attack.  Religious and ethical arguments usually function<br>
at this level, and it is on this level that most discussion is<br>
conducted regarding the use of weapons.<br>
<p>
On yet another level, these tools can be viewed in terms of the<br>
paradigms that engendered and continue to support them, as well as<br>
within the context of future trends and developments that render the<br>
m relevant or outmoded.  They become symbols of the prevailing<br>
social system or cultural modalities.  It is on this level that<br>
futurists can most effectively analyze their utility and span of<br>
continu ed relevance.  Once inserted into the context of achievements<br>
like space travel, human rights advances, and eradication of<br>
disease, the paradigms that support the use of weaponry as a<br>
solution to conflict seem increasingly limited and of a milieu that<br>
appeals to the baser human traits.  Our future progress as humans<br>
will most probably originate in visionary thinking coupled with<br>
diligent, unglam orous work.  With a presently limited lifespan and a<br>
limited amount of resources to invest in a future, it seems most<br>
effective to allocate these resources and time to endeavors most<br>
likely to produc e a sustainable human and posthuman future.<br>
