Judging from a couple of your posts, I thought you would be inclined to<br>
understand my presentations more than some of the others. With no disrespect<br>
intended, I sadly say I was mistaken. Numerous times in my posts, I stated<br>
quite clearly and uniquovically that I reject the concept, morality, as<br>
myth. What was it in my post that led you to conclude that I really didn't<br>
mean it, that I was must be  promoting my own brand of "morality?"<br>
<p>
If I announce to a theist that I do not believe an omni god exists, what I<br>
say my position is does not register in the mind of the theist. The theist<br>
believing that "God" created and maintains all of existence cannot envision<br>
existence without "God". Thus it registers in the mind of the theist that I<br>
do believe but am oppposed to "God". Since the theist equates all of<br>
existence with "God" any criticizm is emotionally taken as life-threatening.<br>
<p>
Encounter a devout governmentalist and you will find the same thing. On<br>
numerous occasions I have explained to one or some that I see government as<br>
the initiation of force. Often, I have illustrated this in great detail,<br>
presumably leaving no impression other than my viewpoint of government as<br>
initition of force and coercion. I then say that I am opposed to government,<br>
which is opposed to the initiation of force and coercion. In opposing this<br>
offensive action called government, I state that I prefer and am an advocate<br>
of individualism and freedom. The words may vary some, but the response I<br>
have gotten time and time again is this: "Nobody can have complete freedom.<br>
You can't shake your rug in somebody else's yard, or go take their property<br>
just because you want to." etc.<br>
<p>
No one tries to refute my assertion that government is initiation of force<br>
and coercior. No one challenges my claim of desire for individualism and<br>
freedom, but immediately assumes that "freedom" means "freedom to rule" and<br>
"absolute freedom" is absolute rule. Without any conscious awareness of the<br>
fact, they regard rule as absolute. They cannot envision freedom; so the<br>
term is emotionally equated with rule in direct contradiction. No amount of<br>
words or actions will induce them to believe that one could abhor doing the<br>
ruling as much as being ruled. <br>
<p>
Nor suprisingly,  I encounter exactly the same response when I oppose the<br>
concept, morality. "Gods, governments and morality" all have the same roots<br>
and same psychology; they're all one epistemological, philosophical and<br>
psychological package:  that all individuals are property of some "superior<br>
being" outside of self. The concept, morality, has no objective identity or<br>
merit whatsoever. (See other posts for detail) So, I reject it, but who so<br>
far has accepted this fact? If you think "morality" is objective and real,<br>
can you envision a world not including it and really understand my position?<br>
If you think it is not objective, but subjective and a matter of personal<br>
choice, then one could toss it aside, couldn't one, i.e., not believe? Or do<br>
you think that "morality" is absolute? Objective absolute? Or "subjective<br>
absolute?" Contradiction? I'm looking for the reason why do you not believe<br>
me when I clearly and repeatedly state that I reject the concept morality as<br>
myth. Again, I ask: from what in my posts did you conclude that &gt;he then<br>
tries to derive moral values from that failure--even more irrational.&lt; ?<br>
<p>
I do not argue the issue of selfishness vs altruism, for there is no such<br>
issue. I argue that altruism is myth. Expose this myth and what remains is<br>
individual looking at self and admitting self interest providing a truth as<br>
some basis for the discussion and efforts to resolve conflicts.<br>
<p>
In the same vein, I do not argue the virtue of one "moral code" over others.<br>
I argue that "morality" is myth. In conjunction, I argue that the basis for<br>
the concept, morality, is illusory superior being. I stated this several<br>
times. Ergo, "morality" is a concept of superior being and subordination of<br>
individual. If I am mistaken about this, fine, show me and will appreciate<br>
it. Suppose, however, that I am not mistaken; that the concept, morality, is<br>
actually a support of anti individual oppression, would not exposing the<br>
myth of morality go a long way toward the promotion of individualism?  Is<br>
individualism your preference? If so, how do you propose to promote the<br>
idea? "Moral argument?" If so, your choice, but when I observe, The<br>
Crusades, The Inquisitions, Jonestown, Waco, world wars, on and on and on as<br>
"resolution" of "moral arguments", I'm inclined to take a different approach.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant to everyday use.  </i><br>
<p>
Then so is individualism and freedom. <br>
