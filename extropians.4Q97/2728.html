: &gt; It's amazing how the Cold War, the nuclear era, was one of the most<br>
: &gt; peaceful periods in Europe's entire history.  It still is peaceful,<br>
: &gt; apart from some fringe areas like Yugoslavia that don't have anything<br>
: &gt; more advanced than primitive artillery, and a bad distribution of guns.<br>
:<br>
: I think that phrase should read "was one of the most peaceful periods<br>
: in Europes entire history *since the Roman Empire*.  Peaceful periods<br>
: in Europe tend to not last a generation, Europe was at peace for quite<br>
: a bit longer than that in the first couple of centuries AD.<br>
<p>
For most of the intervening period, though, I doubt anybody thought<br>
much about the concept of peace *throughout Europe*.  How long did<br>
the average *county* go between wars?  Much more than a generation,<br>
I'd imagine.<br>
<p>
: In at least one incident the U.S. Army deliberately sent a group of<br>
: Indians blankets from an area undergoing an epidemic (cholera?),<br>
: with predictable results.<br>
<p>
(Smallpox.)<br>
I've recently read, if memory serves, that this happened at least once<br>
in colonial days - fallout from one of those endless British-French<br>
quarrels - but there's no hard evidence that US forces ever did it.<br>
For whatever that's worth.<br>
<p>
: There's a new case in this morning's newspaper involving a shooting<br>
: outside a high school. When caught in school with a gun, it's argued<br>
: whether or not suspending them is appropriate!!<br>
<p>
Not all schools are so lenient.  I keep hearing about children being<br>
suspended for possession of an inch-long plastic G.I.Joe weapon, or<br>
for giving one another Midol or aspirin or lemon-drops!<br>
