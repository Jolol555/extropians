<i>&gt; Going right back to fundamentals: it seems clear that we must accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; that *any* technological creates new problems as it solves old ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; (this is what we would expect from a Popperian analysis of knowledge).</i><br>
<i>&gt; The question to focus on, as you suggest, is: does it create more, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; more difficult and dangerous problems, than it solved?  I think the knee</i><br>
<i>&gt; jerk response of the anti-technological is that it always must</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily do so, and that's the bushfire we've got to pour cold water</i><br>
<i>&gt; on.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with this. Some time ago somebody posted the claim to the<br>
omega point theory list that *every* new technology had led to the<br>
decrease in quality of life! The problem with this is that for every<br>
positive technology we can mention (vaccines, the internet, reading<br>
and writing) it is always possible for the anti-technologist to find a<br>
downside, and it *sounds* convincing even if it is untrue (past<br>
cultures doesn't seem significantly happier than ours). What we need<br>
is to take a clear look at how to estimate the relative positive and<br>
negative impacts of new technologies, and choose the positive<br>
ones. This is of course impossible to do with certainty, but we can do<br>
pretty well in many cases. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, we must remember that part of the seductiveness of the neo-primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; position is in the "better the devil you know" argument.  e.g., what's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the use of progress if we are increasingly stressing ourselves out by</i><br>
<i>&gt; having to juggle and balance more and more complexities against each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other? Why start that process? Is the increase of possibilities such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; great value when the price we have to pay is that we are unable to take</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantage of them because we're having to devote so much time and energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; to solving the problems that the mechanics of providing them create? What</i><br>
<i>&gt; sorts of answers can we give to those questions?</i><br>
<p>
I would say we chose our path when our ancestors decided to become<br>
farmers instead of hunter-gatherers. That set a chain of events in<br>
motion that seems to lead us towards posthumanity/oblivion/whatever in<br>
a fairly deterministic manner (farming -&gt; more food -&gt; more people -&gt;<br>
concentration of people -&gt; cities -&gt; organisation -&gt; etc). Mankind as<br>
a whole cannot go back to the hunter-gatherer stage, even if small<br>
groups can if they choose so, since the earth cannot sustain that many<br>
gatherers* even if all people wanted to live that way. <br>
<p>
<p>
* Decreasing the population quickly (in a few generations) without<br>
radical and genocidal methods is practically impossible, both because<br>
of the attitudes of people (they want to bring up children) and<br>
because during the period of decrease a smaller number of young people<br>
have to sustain a larger number of older people; this only works given<br>
advanced automated manufacturing technology, which is anathema to the<br>
neo-primitives.<br>
