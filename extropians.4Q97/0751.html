<i>&gt;        &gt;I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory. But as far as I can        </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one        </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;of two things would need to happen: 1. Everyone would need to       </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;voluntarily adhere to it.   </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                       </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why? Nobody on this list is foolish enough to be talking about a world where  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;everybody can do anything they want to, if you want to bash in my head with a </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;baseball bat and I'd rather you didn't then we can't both have our way. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What many of us are talking about is a world without government and the </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;reasons this would encourage libertarianism. All police would be private </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;police who work for various private protection agencies, and people don't</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;like to PAY to restrain the private behavior of others in most areas, child </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;abuse and perhaps a few others excepted. If you try to enforce your private </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;law that most people hate and find intrusive then it's going to be very </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;expensive for you, however if everybody except me thinks it's important to </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;ware a funny hat every Tuesday and are willing to pay big bucks to enforce it </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;then I'm just going to have to ware a funny hat on Tuesday. Everybody  can't </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;have total control over what laws they want to live by, but we can have a lot </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;more control than we have now.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure if the Libertarian advocacy is for (1) no government globally, <br>
<p>
(2) personal refusal to obey any outside government, or (3) something else.<br>
<p>
<p>
What's the difference between the theoretical large-scale private police force<br>
<p>
and the US government?  Just scale?  Or is it that the US Government doesn't ask<br>
<p>
newborns to sign a contract?  If the latter, would requiring toddlers to either<br>
<p>
sign a contract agreeing to pay lifelong taxes in return for citizenship, use<br>
<p>
of roads, etc., or leave the country immediately satisfy the contraints of<br>
<p>
Libertarianism?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.          </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Of course, this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                        </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is how I think government will die, unless the singularity happens first </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and changes the world so radically that it renders these matters moot. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes. My confidence comes from the </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;power of exponential growth. In general, if I increase the complexity of my </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice  as long to encrypt it, I have </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;made it not twice, but billions of times more difficult for an attacker to </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;break it. The government has access to more  powerful computers than I do,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but not that much more powerful. There is just  no getting around it, recent </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;developments in mathematics and communication have tipped the balance away </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  For the first time in </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;human history 2 people on opposite sides of the world will soon be able to </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;make enforceable contracts without anybody else knowing about it, and even </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;they might not know or need to know the physical location of the other.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in this brave new world, but making rules is easy,  enforcing them is not. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Short of dismantling the internet and confiscating all home computers it's </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;impossible to dictate what form of  encryption or digital cash you must use </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in your home. When people are given a choice between one form of cash that </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;government likes and you pay tax on and another that you don't it won't take </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;them long to make a decision.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't find the </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would not work as </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of course) that </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be extracted, like</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;property taxes and building permits, would have to be increased to astronomic </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a tax revolt would follow. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Without money government will grind to a halt. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Okay, this is starting to make sense to me.  Are you saying that:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Libertarianism disallows imposition of noncensensual government.<br>
<p>
This can be brought about in one of two ways:<br>
<p>
<p>
2. It can be ENFORCED by resisting privately (or in consensual groups)<br>
<p>
<p>
3. Technology may offer an economic model that supercedes government's<br>
<p>
ability to enforce noncensensual rule.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yes?<br>
<p>
<p>
-k.<br>
