This message is being circulated throughout the Internet, and I don't <br>
know where it originated, although it came with attachments coded in <br>
html.  Can anyone render an opinion as to its possible veracity?  Can <br>
cookies possibly be constructed to operate in this fashion?<br>

<i>&gt;From a former AOL employee:</i><br>
<p>
I'll try and cut through the crap, and try to get to the point of this <br>
letter.  I used to work for America Online, and would like to remain <br>
anonymous for that reason.  I was laid off in early September, but I <br>
know exactly why I was laid off, which I will now explain:<br>
<p>
Since last December, I had been one of the many people assigned to <br>
design AOL 4.0 for Windows  (AOL 4.0 beta, codenamed Casablanca).  In <br>
the beginning, I was very proud of this task, until I found out the true <br>
cost of it.  Things were going fine until about mid-February, when me <br>
and 2 of my colleagues started to suspect a problem, an unexplainable <br>
'Privacy Invasion', with the new version.  One of them, who is a master <br>
programmer, copied the finished portion of the new version (Then 'Build <br>
52'), and took it home, and we spent nearly 2 weeks of sleepless nights <br>
examining and debugging the program, flipping it inside-out, and here is <br>
what we found.<br>
<p>
Unlike all previous versions of America Online, version 4.0 puts <br>
something in your hard drive called a 'cookie'.  (AOL members click &lt;A <br>
HREF="aol://4344:1047.g334.8411481.532897009"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; for a<br>
definition).  However, the cookie we found on Version 4.0 was far more <br>
treacherous than the simple internet cookie.  How would you like <br>
somebody looking at your entire hard drive, snooping through any (yes, <br>
any) piece of information on your hard drive.  It could also read your <br>
password and log in information and store it deep in the program code. <br>
Well, all previous versions, whether you like it or not, have done this <br>
to a certain extent, but only with files you downloaded.  As me and my <br>
colleagues discovered, with the new version, anytime you are signed on <br>
to AOL, any top aol executive, any aol worker, who has been sworn to <br>
secrecy regarding this feature, can go into your hard drive and retrieve <br>
any piece of information that they so desire.  Billing, download <br>
records, e-mail, directories, personal documents, programs, financial <br>
information, scanned images, etc ... Better start keeping all those <br>
pictures on a floppy disk!<br>
<p>
This is a totally disgusting violation of our rights, and your right to <br>
know as well.  Since this is undoubtably 'Top Secret' information that I <br>
am revealing, my life at AOL is pretty much over.  After discovering <br>
this information, we started to inform a few other workers at America <br>
Online, so that we could get a large enough crew to stop this from <br>
happening to the millions of unfortunate and unsuspecting America Online <br>
members.  This was in early August.  One month later, all three of us <br>
were unemployed.  We got together, and figured there was something we <br>
had to do to let the public know.<br>
<p>
Unemployed, with one of us going through a divorce (me) and another who <br>
is about to undergo treatment for Cancer, our combined financial <br>
situation is not currently enough to release any sort or article.  We <br>
attempted to create a web page on three different servers containing <br>
in-depth information on AOL 4.0, but all three were taken down within 2 <br>
days.  We were running very low on time (4.0 is released early this <br>
winter), so we figured our last hope to reveal this madness before it <br>
effects the people was starting something similar to a chain letter, <br>
this letter you are reading.  Please do the following, to help us expose <br>
AOL for who they really are, and to help us and yourself recieve <br>
personal gratification for taking a stand for our freedom:<br>
<p>
1.          Forward this letter to as many people as you can (not just friends <br>
        and family, as many as you can!)<br>
<p>
2.          Tell people who aren't on America Online in person, especially <br>
        important people (Private Investigators, Government workers, City <br>
        Council)<br>
<p>
3.        If the information about the new version isn't exposed by the time <br>
        aol is released early this winter, for your own protection, DON'T <br>
        DOWNLOAD AOL 4.0 UNDER ANY CONDITION !!!<br>
<p>
Thank you for reading and examining this information.  Me and my <br>
colleagues hope that you will help us do the right thing in this <br>
situation.  Enjoy America Online (just kidding!).<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
A former AOL employee<br>
