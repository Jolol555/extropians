<p>
      OK: let's look at this.<br>
<p>
      BTW:  My Relational Mechanics paper (almost no equations!) is at:<br>
<p>
                      <a href="http://www.agora.demon.co.uk">http://www.agora.demon.co.uk</a><br>
<p>
      As a preliminary remark: wonder a bit about optical illusions before <br>
      unthinkingly giving primacy to 'observations.'  Newton constantly <br>
      used his theory to correct Astronomer-Royal Flamsteed's 'observations'<br>
      using his (Newton's) theory. (Drove Flamsteed crazy, actually!).<br>
<p>
      All 'observations' are theory-impregnated. A straw partially immersed<br>
      in water 'is observed to be' bent.  Is it _really_ bent or <br>
      _objectively_ straight?<br>
<p>
<p>
      The velocity of light is (approximately) constant at 'c', but only <br>
      _relative to the emitting charge_.  In a Galilean framework (i.e. <br>
      'position-space', which is _logically inescapable_ once you abandon <br>
      locality -- see Bell, Aspect etc.), velocity addition is clearly <br>
      demonstrable as well as being logically necessary.<br>
<p>
      However, there is a constant process of absorption and re-emission <br>
      as photons travel from A to B (there is no perfect vacuum in space <br>
      -- some of the most perfect vacuums around are probably right here <br>
      on Earth). Accordingly, all the photons arriving here from stellar <br>
      sources are ineluctably travelling at around 'c' relative to the <br>
      interstellar 'particle soup' which is what's actually emitting them.<br>
<p>
      NB: It is _extremely_ difficult to measure the velocity of a photon <br>
      without interposing interactions which entail absorption and <br>
      re-emission, thus destroying the original velocity.<br>
<p>
      Let's see _your_ proposals for measuring photon velocity...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
     In space, the free electrons are particularly voracious absorbers and <br>
     emitters of photons.  The photons perform _work_ on the electrons as <br>
     they're absorbed and re-emitted.  They move the electrons around. <br>
     This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier <br>
     et. al.) is the cause of the cosmic (Hubble) redshift, which is of <br>
     course directly proportional to the distance stellar photons have to <br>
     travel to get here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;untestable,</i><br>
<p>
      It's untestable because it's unrepeatable (or so you should hope!).<br>

<i>&gt; The Big Bang predicted that as our telescopes got bigger we would find &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; that billions of years ago the galaxies were closer together than they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; now. We have.</i><br>
<p>
      No way, Jose!  As Leibniz pointed out, the same facts can be <br>
      explained by an indefinitely large number of different theories.  <br>
      Since all 'observations' are theory-impregnated also, the absurdity <br>
      of the assertion you cite should be plain enough.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The observable universe has a radius of 10 to 20 billion light years, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the big bang theory predicts that we will never find an object in it</i><br>
<i>&gt; older than 10 to 20 billion years. So far at least nobody has, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; some things are getting close</i><br>
<p>
       Oh, c'mon!!!  The cosmologists are 'explaining away' astronomical <br>
       artefacts older than the estimated age of the Universe all the <br>
       time!!!  As is always the case with degenerating scientific <br>
       programmes, they scrap the evidence rather than their pet 'BB' <br>
       theories.  "Normal-Science" physicists crave emotional security...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; To a first approximation the universe IS the blackbody radiation, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; other stuff is just debris</i><br>
<p>
      NoNoNo; the Universe _includes_ the debris.  And it's the <br>
      interstellar debris which is scattering the stellar radiation, <br>
      giving rise to the uniform background.  It accounts for it very <br>
      well, actually.<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... so I don't think a theory that predicts such a huge feature is doing </i><br>
<i>&gt; too badly.</i><br>
              <br>
      That's because you're looking for _confirmations_ rather than <br>
      _refutations_, as I am.  Remember the mediaeval scholasticism "All <br>
      swans are white"?  Millions of white swans 'confirmed' it, but the <br>
      black swans were there all the time, over in Australia...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;and arguably physically impossible.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, let's hear your argument. </i><br>
<p>
      One word.  'Singularity.'  That is, 'impossible within known physics.'<br>
     <br>
                       "Ex nihilo, nihil fit" <br>
<p>
      <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;It owes its fell origin to the disastrous philosphical memes which         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;invaded the scientific community at the turn of the century.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Big Bang was unknown at the turn of the century and only became popular </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the 60's when the evidence for it overwhelmed competing theories.</i><br>
<p>
      You've been reading too many childrens' histories of physics!  Go <br>
      read 'Subtle Is The Lord' by Abraham Pais (who is far from agreeing <br>
      with me on his hero Einstein, BTW).  It's fairly definitive <br>
      scientific biography.  Once people 'bought into' the positivist idea <br>
      of 'the observable universe' being identical to 'the universe', they <br>
      _had_ to explain why the titchy island universe hadn't <br>
      self-gravitated long since.<br>
      <br>
      How else would _you_ possibly explain this problem-situation?<br>
<p>
      The positivists don't _allow_ you to plead _absolute rotation_, <br>
      remember -- _you can't have rotation relative to * nothing *.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Logical positivism said: "You cannot disuss a universe you cannot         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;observe.  Thus, the univere is _defined_ as that which you can see </i><br>
<i>        &gt;i.e. a titchy one, around 5 000 light-years across."</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt; I'm certainly not a logical positivist ...</i><br>
<p>
        Well, thank Heavens for that, John!  It's a dead philosophy!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but that characterization is unfair, they're not that dumb.</i><br>
<p>
        Read Pais...  They _had to be_ that dumb.  Positivists are like <br>
        that -- their metaphysics gives them no choice in the matter!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt; embedded moralities and epistemologies of physical theories, most of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt; which are _appalling_.    </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The appalling and crazy idea is that morality can be deduced from a </i><br>
<i>&gt; physical theory or that a physical theory can be deduced from morality.</i><br>
<p>
       Are you saying that Kant was crazy?  20 000 people spontaneously <br>
       attended his funeral.  How many are coming to yours?  &gt;:-}<br>
       <br>
       Seriously: TRUTH has a central regulating role in values AND facts.<br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;Don't import your enemies' anti-extropic concepts all unwitting.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can think of no idea more anti-extropic than that we can determine a </i><br>
<i>&gt; law of physics or the nature of the cosmos by wishing.</i><br>
<p>
       Humans invent and select (i.e. _choose_) our preferred theories and <br>
       Methodological Scientific Research Programmes.  Ineluctably, <br>
       metaphysics is prior to physical theories -- it's unavoidable.<br>
<p>
       I have -- extropic -- 'touchstone tests':  If General Relativity <br>
       depicts a four-dimensional Parmenidean Block Universe, within which<br>
       nothing ever changes, and in which free will is a delusion, I <br>
       _choose_ to say 'to Hell with it.'   <br>
       <br>
       If Ernst Mach tells us that all life is physically determined, with <br>
       consciousness being a mere _epiphenomenon_, I _choose_ to say "To <br>
       Hell with him too.'  And his positivism along with him.<br>
       <br>
       If a 'scientific socialist' says that all History is <br>
       materialistically determined, I say "To hell with all that" (tens <br>
       of millions of people indeed went to various Communist Hells via <br>
       just that notion).<br>
<p>
       My touchstone tests tell me that theories are volitional human <br>
       inventions, and their acceptance a matter of _choice_.  If anyone <br>
       tries to tell me anything different, I just say 'To Hell with them <br>
       too.'  It's a methodological decision.  We do it all the time.<br>
       <br>
       We _all_ take metaphysical positions, like it or not.<br>

<i>&gt;       &gt;Einstein's old GR idea of a closed but unbounded Riemannian space         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;where nothing ever changes (determinist) is defunct </i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt; What is defunct about closed but unbounded Riemannian space?  </i><br>
<p>
        Read Karl Popper, "Unended Quest" for starters.<br>
        <br>
        Think a bit about the wisdom of swapping metaphysical straight <br>
        lines for 'straight-lines-as-light-beams-subject-to-gravity.'<br>
        <br>
        I work with Cordwainer Smith's idea of an infinitely extended <br>
        cubic grid.  Telepathic astronomy!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
              <br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Einstein himself said it GR was in error many times.    </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not quite. Einstein never lost confidence in his theory and even today </i><br>
<i>&gt; no reputable physicist has, unless you're talking about the singularity at </i><br>
<i>&gt; the center on a black hole, or when things gets smaller than the Plank </i><br>
<i>&gt; length of 10^ -33 centimeters or events get shorter than 10^-45 seconds.</i><br>
<p>
      Again: read Pais, "Subtle Is The Lord."  He thought GR was wrong, <br>
      and spent decades trying to come up with 'a more realistic theory' <br>
      (like mine!  &gt;:-} Actually, it wouldn't matter a bean to me whether <br>
      or not Einstein did 'lose confidence' in his theory.  His theory is <br>
      methodologically flawed and empirically falsified.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Einstein discovered General Relativity in 1917</i><br>
<p>
      NoNoNo...  we 'discover' _facts_ :-  we _invent_ theories.  You're <br>
      not an inductivist, are you, for Heaven's sakes?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and the equations said that the universe must be expanding or contracting,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the time he thought this disagreed with observation so he was forced </i><br>
<i>&gt; to stick on a new term, a "cosmological constant" to make the universe &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; static. He always said he hated it because it was ugly and detracted from </i><br>
<i>&gt; the beauty of his theory, but he could see no alternative.</i><br>
<p>
      So, which General Relativity are you advocating: GR-with-added-CC or <br>
      vanilla-GR?  Everyone seems to 'understand' a different version of <br>
      GR, anyway...<br>
<p>
      <br>
<i>&gt; In 1929 Hubble found that the universe was not static after all but was  </i><br>
<i>&gt; expanding, everybody was surprised and a few were delighted.</i><br>
<p>
      NoNoNo... Hubble observed a redshift of the specra of stars, which <br>
      is cleanly and easily accounted for by the interactions of stellar <br>
      photons with interstellar debris, which I have discussed previously.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; "the worst blunder of my career".    </i><br>
<p>
      The worst blunder of Einstein's career was to steal Walter Ritz's <br>
      ballistic [(particle) theory of light without keeping Ritz's <br>
      Galilean Relativity framework.  Alas, as did everyone back then, <br>
      Einstein had to keep 'in' with Lorentz to get anywhere. (Einstein's <br>
      Special Relativity and Lorentz's electrodynamics are functionally <br>
      identical -- SR is a mathematical formalism of Lorentz's physical <br>
      theory).<br>
       <br>
      There's a (little-noticed) Ritz-Einstein paper on their agreements <br>
      and differences I'd like to get hold of.  Anyone, pretty-please?<br>
<p>
      For all practical purposes, Walter Ritz _invented Quantum <br>
      Electrodynamics_  Ritz [1908].  Richard Feynman _must have known this_ -- <br>
      he and Wheeler knew Ritz's work intimately well.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic Cardinal, proposed in [1440] an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;infinite Euclidean Universe </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And he was wrong. The universe may or may not be infinite but it is certainly </i><br>
<i>&gt; not Euclidean, if it were gravity could not exist. </i><br>
<p>
      That verges on the absurd ... Relational or Faradayan or Newtonian <br>
      or Graviton-mediated gravitational force gets along just fine in a <br>
      Euclidean framework.  What the hell are you talking about?  GR?<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;This predated Copernicus!     </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And takes nothing away from Copernicus.</i><br>
<p>
      It sure as hell takes away Copernicus' _priority_, just for starters!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; A scientific theory is more than vague armchair philosophy</i><br>
<p>
      However, scientific theories are human inventions -- their _origin_ <br>
      is mostly impenetrable, and - mostly - irrelevant.  All that we can <br>
      fairly ask of any scientific theory -- a _hypothesis_  -- is that we <br>
      can deduce testable descriptions, explanations and predictions from <br>
      it.<br>
      <br>
      There's an Adam-Smithian division of labour in these matters.  A <br>
      theory may come to you in a dream (Kekule's benzene ring, <br>
      ferinstance).  You post it here in 'Extropians', and it becomes <br>
      World III Objective Knowledge, existing quite independently of your <br>
      consciousness, and fully discussable by us.  We then work with it.<br>
      <br>
                    p1  --&gt; t1 --&gt; dp --&gt; ee --&gt; p2<br>
      <br>
      Where p1 is the initial problem;  t1 the tentative theory; dp the <br>
      deduction of testable propositions; ee is error elimination via <br>
      refuting experiments, critical discussion, etc.; and p2 is the <br>
      resulting -- secondary -- problem-situation.  Everything begins and <br>
      ends with problems and guesses.<br>
<p>
      <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;The background radiation is the product of particle interactions   </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What particles? What interactions? What shape does your theory predict </i><br>
<i>&gt; the spectrum of to have, that of a radiating blackbody as observed? What </i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature does your theory predict this blackbody radiation to have?</i><br>
<p>
      As above.  The redshift is a function of the ratio of interstellar <br>
      debris (including other photons) to distance of space traversed.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
<i>         &gt;and also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt; You could argue about cause but there is absolutely no doubt that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; redshift is real and almost no doubt that its magnitude is proportional</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the distance an object is from Earth.</i><br>
<p>
      I fully agree.  Clumsily put!<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt; If it is caused by the Doppler shift then it must be due to the general </i><br>
<i>&gt; expansion of the entire universe</i><br>
<p>
      Wrong way round...  _If_ it's a Doppler shift, _then_ the Universe <br>
      is expanding.  See?  _If_ it's caused by stellar photons losing <br>
      energy on their way through the 'interstellar soup', the Universe is <br>
      moving around a bit, sure, but not 'expanding' overall.  An infinite <br>
      Universe has nowhere to expand _into_.  Right?<br>
<p>
<p>
      I thank you for an interesting discussion; I hope others here are <br>
      enjoying it too!<br>
