OK !<br>

I will use this ! We did indeed decide to become Transhumans instead<br>
of Extropist because of the different opinions on this subject.<br>
It also has to do with the pro-government-climate in the Netherlands.<br>
And to be honest I don't think (IMHO) that it has to change much,<br>
(for now that is)......although we still have to find out how we can deal<br>
with the law regarding Cryonics.<br>
"...if their not in our way.....let them have their government :-) "<br>
