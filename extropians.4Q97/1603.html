Arjen Kamphuis writes<br>
: Well (little private theorising here) in the last century, when railroad<br>
: infrastruture was being contstructed, Europe was already a densly populated<br>
: area with a complex society. And most country's weren't truly democratic.<br>
: States were the only ones capable of undertaking such projects and so they<br>
: did. Also in Europe good infrastructure was vital for military reasons. In<br>
: the US there was no Royalty in the classic sense and lotsa more room for<br>
: anybody with a daring idea. All of this is just an 'educated guess' - maybe<br>
: there are historians on the list who can shed a light on this. They<br>
: question why states came into existance in the various form they did and<br>
: what caused the *differences* is relevant to anyone wishing to obsolete<br>
: them, know your enemy and all that ;-)<br>
<p>
What makes this dubious is that in England the canals and railroads<br>
were privately built.  In fact, if I remember right, they were built<br>
by Nonconformists (non-Anglicans), who suffered certain legal<br>
disabilities (they couldn't have government jobs, for instance)<br>
until sometime in the 19C.<br>
<p>
:  &gt;: But maybe I still do not fully understand anarchocapitalism. In such<br>
:  &gt;: a society, without a state of any sort, who makes and upholds laws?<br>
:  &gt;: or is it every person for him/herself?<br>
<p>
:  &gt;Most law enforcement *is* at the individual level.<br>
:  &gt;You have locks on your doors, no?<br>
<p>
: Wiil a lock be enough? The only way to prevent criminals to enter my house<br>
: and loot the place (Yes, certain things I own are important to me) would be<br>
: to live in a fortress or to have some kind of weapon to discourage them.<br>
: I don't much like the first option and the alternative would lead to a<br>
: personal arms race between me and anybody that I think might want to hurt<br>
: me. I gues you know the argument... I see no way out of this.<br>
<p>
You seem to assume that your opponents are willing to spend unlimited<br>
effort and resources to get at you.  In fact, your computer and your<br>
goldfish are worth only a finite amount, and probably far less to<br>
anyone else than to you.<br>
<p>
I remember a meal in a restaurant somewhere, when a policeman in the<br>
next booth told his friends (loudly and repeatedly), "Locks are not<br>
meant to stop thieves: locks are to keep honest people honest," i.e.<br>
to remove temptation.  I wouldn't go that far (how would I know, I'm<br>
not in the crime business!); it seems to me if you do *anything* to<br>
make the burglar's job more difficult, you reduce the number of attempts.<br>
If the burglar needs costly high-tech equipment to get into your<br>
house, where's his profit?<br>
<p>
As for the arms race, experience seems to suggest otherwise.  About<br>
a million times a year, an American shows a gun to a potential attacker,<br>
and the attacker flees.  Doesn't have to be a big fancy gun, any gun<br>
will do.<br>
<p>
: I'm not even going to make a long case about such a society being<br>
: quickly conquered by a society that didn't abolish the cetralised<br>
: state (and thus has a large, heavily equipped army).<br>
<p>
I'm glad - because there are arguments against that too, but they're<br>
rather unsatisfying.<br>
<p>
	[snip]<br>
:  &gt;My dream is to build free institutions *beside* the State, in no way<br>
:  &gt;dependent on it, so that if the State should crumble we'll be no more<br>
:  &gt;disturbed than if some big corporation - AT&amp;T, let's say - goes out<br>
:  &gt;of business.  (I don't mean to imply *no* disturbance. If AT&amp;T crashes<br>
:  &gt;millions of people will be inconvenienced for a few weeks, but there<br>
:  &gt;are other wires.)<br>
:<br>
: Problem remains how you can garuantee in any way that these institutions<br>
: don't become the instruments of dictators or some such (without any form of<br>
: democratic control). One of the oldest political problems, who will guard<br>
: us from our guardians? But I agree that it's always good to have a backups.<br>
<p>
One answer is to have three or more sets of guardians, none of whom has<br>
any institutional dependence on the other(s), watching each other.  The<br>
division of powers (legislative, executive, judicial) was intended to<br>
accomplish that, but in practice they all depend so much on each other<br>
that they cannot be called independent - they're not parallel guardians,<br>
they're elements of the same guardian.  I don't know just how to beat<br>
that problem.<br>
<p>
: This was educational, thank Anton,<br>
<p>
And thank you for your patience.<br>
