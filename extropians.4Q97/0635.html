As if I needed another reason, but today's DOJ announcement of a $1 =<br>
million a day fine levied against Microsoft for antitrust violations is =<br>
a great reason for voting Libertarian.  I have only seen the Nando News =<br>
story which I have snipped the following:<br>
<p>
"This is a very serious abuse," said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. =<br>
Klein, head of the antitrust division. He said Microsoft's action was =<br>
designed to undermine the dominant market position of Netscape.<br>
<p>
Internet browsers are important, Klein said, because they "could erode =<br>
Microsoft's operating system monopoly" in the Windows operating system. =<br>
"This kind of product forcing is an abuse of monopoly power and we seek =<br>
to put an end to it."<br>
<p>
The Justice Department objected to Microsoft's requirement that computer =<br>
manufacturers who want to license the Windows 95 operating system also =<br>
license its internet browser, known as Internet Explorer. Most personal =<br>
computer makers install Windows 95 at the factory.<br>
<p>
Klein said, "These are two different products." He said they should be =<br>
sold as two separate products and denied the government is taking sides =<br>
in the battle for market share between Microsoft and Netscape, whose =<br>
browser is known as Navigator.<br>
<p>
"Each of Microsoft's products should compete on its own merits," Klein =<br>
said.<br>
<p>
Microsoft's new browser software blurs the line between personal =<br>
computers and the Internet. By working closely with Microsoft's Windows =<br>
95 operating software, Internet Explorer lets people easily point and =<br>
click between desktop files and Web sites.<br>
<p>
"Anyone can give away a browser, but no one can force it onto a computer =<br>
desktop unless you have monopoly power," Klein said. Antitrust law does =<br>
not bar monopolies achieved by a company's talent and ingenuity, but =<br>
does prevent abuse of that monopoly."<br>
<p>
If this is not a bias intervention, then what is?  Love Microsoft, or =<br>
hate it.  But, I cannot see how this action is justified.  How can =<br>
someone like Klein determine when something is done through "talent and =<br>
ingenuity" or "abuse."  I have been using I.E. 4.0 since its early beta, =<br>
and personally, I would say it errs more on the side of "talent and =<br>
ingenuity."  Even more insidious, in my opinion, is someone in the DOJ =<br>
determining what is and what isn't an OS component.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>

Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can =<br>
change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.<br>
