<i>&gt;Foundations of Transhumanism is a new web site that will provide easy</i><br>
<i>&gt;access to selected transhumanist material of an academic nature. </i><br>
<p>
You may wish to add a link to Max More's doctoral dissertation which<br>
treats the topic of identity. This is a central concern to any<br>
transhuman/posthuman being which has the capability of transforming<br>
"itself"  radically. <br>

THE DIACHRONIC SELF: IDENTITY, <br>
CONTINUITY, TRANSFORMATION<br>
(Ph.D. Dissertation by Max More,<br>
1995, Dept. of Philosophy,<br>
University of Southern<br>
California.)<br>

The link above leads directly to the thesis and will work, but the site<br>
uses frames so you may wish to access the thesis by going thru<br>
<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/">http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/</a><br>

Since you have a link to "Engines of Creation" you may wish to add a link<br>
to "Unbounding the Future":<br>

<i>&gt;But if some student who is writing her MA, say, wants to do it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism, she will have a hard time convincing her professors that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is really something more than science fiction and entertaining</i><br>
<i>&gt;speculation. </i><br>

The case for examining transhumanist issues could perhaps be strengthened<br>
by referring to ongoing technical progress. Links to the full papers of<br>
the upcoming Fifth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology are<br>
available: <br>
