For extropians participating in a local EIGs (Extropy Investment Group) or<br>
investment discussions on the list, I have to say, today was a hair-pulling<br>
day.  Not because it wasn't evident that the stocks were plummeting, but<br>
because I was making trades just when it was announced:<br>
<p>
"NEW YORK -- Given the orderly pace of things, no one is calling it Black<br>
Monday yet. But the dramatic decline in Wall Street so far today has caught<br>
everyone's attention -- especially after the New York Stock Exchange put the<br>
brakes on all trading at midafternoon."<br>
<p>
It was midafternoon when I tried retouching that dial to put a hold on a<br>
trade.  I thought it might be better to get up at the crack of dawn and see<br>
what the numbers are tomorrow morning.  It is quite a heart-beat when the<br>
lines are busy and the clock is ticking and you don't know whether the trade<br>
has confirmed or not.<br>
<p>
It is said that stock is a thrill - a roller coaster ride at times like<br>
this.  I surely felt it today.  <br>
<p>
Thanks to James Rogers and Peter Voss for giving solid investment advice<br>
during this vulnerable time:  "Now is a good time to invest."<br>
