A law as evil as it is unworkable. I'm certainly not in favor of banning guns, <br>
however if I had to choose between banning guns and banning ideas, even bad <br>
ideas, I would not hesitate in banning the guns. Fortunately the question is <br>
academic. Modern governments have had little success in keeping their <br>
subjects from having access to objects they don't like, they will have even <br>
less success in stopping changes of voltage on a line because they don't like <br>
the bits of information that some interpret those changes to mean.<br>
