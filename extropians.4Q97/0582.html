IAN: Preslicely... The symbiotic relation between <br>
plants and fungi cited in the study is analogous<br>
to free-market exchange, not communism. The sub-<br>
sidy of smaller plants by fungi is analogous to<br>
an investment in future profits, not charity.<br>
<p>
The Science News article defined all that as <br>
"communist" and as "cooperative," as if the <br>
opposite of communism, free markets, are <br>
the opposite of cooperation. What could<br>
be further from the truth? Free association<br>
is cooperation,  central planning is coercion.<br>
<p>
I have difficultly accounting for the basis<br>
of the false analogies in the SN article, which<br>
turn beautiful examples of market eco-nomics into <br>
the opposite... but wait a minute Ian, is not A <br>
also its opposite? Uh, oh ya. Hu, huh huh huh. <br>
<p>
Communism is an integral feature of the identity<br>
of free-market capitalism, for, apart from relation<br>
to communism, capitalism would not have the identity<br>
as "the best system." Without that identity attribute<br>
based upon real-world relations, the idea of communism <br>
could appear to be a beneficial theory, while capitalism <br>
perhaps an inferior system. Therefore, clearly, communism <br>
is within the IDentity Set (the set that contains all <br>
those feature from which identity A is derived) <br>
of capitalism as we know it, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
All that falls inside the ID Set <br>
of A is within the identity of A... <br>
<p>
Holistic IDentity<br>
<p>
Opposite yet same.<br>
Not-self yet self.<br>
Nuts yet not-nuts.<br>
Not-A yet A.<br>
