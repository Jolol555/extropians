Thanks for your extremely illuminating post, John.=A0 A brief comment<br>
below on my use of "chaotic" as applied to design of nanosystems:<br>
<p>
In my post I suggested that design of a nanosystem runs against issues<br>
with computation of the final state of a chaotic system.=A0 John =<br>
correctly<br>
points out that a complex system needn't be a chaotic one, and =<br>
parallels<br>
the construction of nanosystems with biological processes that create<br>
our bodies:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: John K Clark [SMTP:johnkc@well.com]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just because a process is complex does not prove it is chaotic.</i><br>
Proteins<br>
<i>&gt; start out as a linear sequence of amino acids that=A0 can't do much, =</i><br>
but<br>
<i>&gt; then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a manner too complex for any computer to simulate, they fold up</i><br>
into<br>
<i>&gt; intricate shapes and that gives then their power. Despite their</i><br>
<i>&gt; staggering</i><br>
<i>&gt; complexity these shapes are=A0 repeatable. If the shape of proteins =</i><br>
were<br>
<i>&gt; exquisite sensitivity to tiny=A0 variations in the environment then =</i><br>
they<br>
<i>&gt; would</i><br>
<i>&gt; never take the same shape twice=A0 and life would be impossible.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.=A0 My concern is not the repeatability so much as our ability to<br>
predict what the final shape will be based on only our knowledge of the<br>
original configuration.=A0 This is an issue because as a nanosystem<br>
designer, I /start/ with a desire for a particular output, and must =<br>
work<br>
backwards to a specific design for the nanites that will construct the<br>
object.<br>
<p>
In a broad sense what I'm saying is that the transformation from<br>
genotype to phenotype is a chaotic one.=A0 Ie, a tiny change in =<br>
genotype<br>
may result in a much larger change in phenotype.=A0 To bridge back to<br>
nanotech: the desired output of a nanotech process is the phenotype, =<br>
the<br>
design(s) of the individual assemblers is the genotype.=A0 How do I get<br>
from A to B?<br>
<p>
As you point out, I'm not necessarily correct in calling this<br>
transformation "chaotic".=A0 It is indeed /complex/, in that it clearly<br>
obeys some higher-level rules.=A0 Those rules, however, are part of a<br>
theory that we do not yet have, and which I suspect to be much more<br>
complex than we envision.<br>
<p>
(Note that in biotech we've had the advantage of being able to sample<br>
existing creatures, examining their genotype and comparing to the<br>
creature's phenotype.=A0 In nanotech we'll be starting from scratch, =<br>
and<br>
it seems that without radical developments in complexity theory (or<br>
quantum computation?) risky trial-and-error may be the only effective<br>
means of design.)<br>
