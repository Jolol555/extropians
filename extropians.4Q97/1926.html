The idea that those empty bubbles are huge spheres of dysoned galaxies<br>
is a fanciful one, but not supported by observed evidence. That most<br>
observable matter coalesced into the interbubble regions is an observed<br>
confirmation of big bang theory predictions, that its the small<br>
percentage of fluff normal matter that was in excess of the ~50%<br>
matter/antimatter ratio.<br>
<p>
Additionally, if there were just dysoned stars in those bubbles, then<br>
there would still be ample interstellar gasses for new star formation,<br>
as well as a measurable amount of nova and supernovae detritus.<br>
<p>
One area where missing mass may be found is in megagalaxies. Astronomers<br>
have recently found a galaxy that is ten times the mass of our own<br>
galaxy, but is so large in size(100x the milky ways diameter) that its<br>
mass is spread out to the point of undetectability unless you are<br>
specifically looking for it, and can expose long enough to gather enough<br>
light to visualize.<br>
<p>
Has anyone found a current guesstimate of the matter "equivalence" of<br>
all of the energy in the universe at that 3 deg K cosmic background<br>
level? has this been accounted for in the missing mass calcs???<br>
