 <br>
<i>&gt; Once again, you are comparing apples and oranges. If such high</i><br>
<i>&gt; strength construction were to be used in vehicles, it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; applied to both minicars and 1/2 ton pickups, so in my analogy as</i><br>
<i>&gt; amended by you, both the 98lbder and the linebacker would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; padding, since they would both have "current technology". In such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; case, who would be hurt more???? Stop avoiding the answer you know I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am expecting....</i><br>
<p>
You mean, stop refusing to accept the answer we know is wrong.<br>
<p>
Are you asserting that, today, all classes of vehicle have similar <br>
safety features?  If so, you are misinformed.  In general, massive <br>
vehicles rely on their mass for protection from accidents; less <br>
massive vehicles rely more on good design and good materials.  In a <br>
medium-speed collision between a Mercedes and a dump truck, we can <br>
expect the Mercedes to be totalled and the dump truck to have a few <br>
scratches; and we can expect the Mercedes occupants, uninjured, to <br>
administer first aid to the dump truck driver.<br>
