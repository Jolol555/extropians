I'm curious as to the actual link betwen speed of thought and perception<br>
of time.  Is there any reason to believe that the two are inexorably<br>
linked as you seem to suggest above?  Does thinking more quickly<br>
actually cause one's perception of time to slow down?  If anything, I've<br>
found the opposite to be true: having little to think about/do causes my<br>
experience of time to slow, while when my mind is particularly engaged,<br>
time seems to fly by.  I understand that my mental processes are not<br>
physically accelerated/decelerated in these varying states of mind.<br>
However it's clear that we can experience altered perceptions of time<br>
based on our thought processes, mental activity, drug use and<br>
anticipation.  Comments?<br>
