<i>&gt; &gt; I find it very frustrating that the list spends so much time on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; irrelevant issues of economics and politics. The current economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and political environment will not change significantly prior to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the singularity: there's not enough time, even if the event occurs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in 2025.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have to disagree with you at least on the economics part. Before</i><br>
<i>&gt; we get to a singularity caused by nanotech or powerful enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers for human-level AI there will be major economic changes</i><br>
<i>&gt; due to the increasing cheapness of computing power and bandwidth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These changes result in what Wired calls a "Network Economy" (see</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wired 5.09, "New Rules for the New Economy"); we already live in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the beginnings of this, everything on the net is part of it. Article</i><br>
<i>&gt; is here: <a href="http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html">http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; It makes some interesting points, especially the idea that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; if not all commodities in our world are dipping towards being free.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anything from a CD player to a modem to a stock quote online gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheaper. In the coming years your phone line will dip towards free</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they offer you better stuff(xDSL) for $$$. Reading and becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; familiar with these ideas can give you a powerful edge- for me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading it triggered an idea for a new net-based business that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is starting up on Monday!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for politics, I can tell you from my experience that since I</i><br>
<i>&gt; ran into the net 4 years ago it has significantly changed _me_.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that over the next 25 years or so as the majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the planet gains net access (hopefully) there is the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; for something to happen.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, many things will get a lot cheaper. Moore's law is an exponential,<br>
and has survived all attempts at constraint due to physical laws<br>
by hoppong from one technology to another. Yes, the underlying<br>
concept of economic value will change radically for a large percentage<br>
of current GNP. Yes, this is all revolutionary.<br>
<p>
Yes, our political world is changing in some ways due to bette<br>
information flow, and may change some more.<br>
<p>
There will be dramatic pre-singularity econimic changes, and<br>
possibly technology-driven political changes.<br>
<p>
My point is that we should be discussing these changes, not<br>
political and economic philosophy based on the current situation.<br>
