When I lived in Nebraska, all the gas contained at least 10% ethanol,<br>
distilled locally from agricultural waste.  Not only did it make the gas<br>
cheaper, but it burned cleaner and improved the octane rating as well.  It<br>
has never been clear to me why ethanol enhanced gas isn't available in many<br>
places, such as California, where there is plenty of agricultural waste and<br>
an obvious need for cleaner fuel.  There is very little investment required<br>
to make this change, so it would appear (to me) to be an obvious and<br>
available improvement in the current state of affairs.<br>
