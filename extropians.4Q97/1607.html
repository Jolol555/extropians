I just saw a show on the Discovery channel on octopi. They showed that<br>
wild octopi are freindly and even gregarious with divers. Squid, however<br>
are rather predatory and only see a diver as another meal to drag down<br>
to the depths. Octopi apparently need to keep their brains segmented so<br>
they can squeeze through tight spots. I think that this is probably the<br>
major stumbling block to their natural evolution toward greater<br>
intelligence. While their coral habitat enabled them to develop<br>
excellent spatial problem solving skills, their need to squeeze through<br>
spaces is an environmental limitation on further brain integration.<br>
Anyone developing greater intelligence in octopi would need to teach<br>
them tool using strategies for fishing to overcome the expected mobility<br>
reduction a larger more integrated brain would entail. Possibly weaving<br>
nets with seaweed. squeezing a big brain through a small space would<br>
probably cause as much brain damage as a heavy weight boxing match.<br>
