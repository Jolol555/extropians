Thanks for being provocative ;-) and for clarifying.<br>
<p>
After I made that post I finally got around to<br>
reading your "Cortical Integration" paper and found<br>
it to be a useful survey. Perhaps another approach is<br>
the "spreading waves of activation" network (see <br>
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/Noetica/OpenForumIssue5/SWA.html">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/Noetica/OpenForumIssue5/SWA.html</a><br>
)<br>
<p>
One problem I sometimes have in interpreting (or<br>
maybe it’s in responding to) some posts is summed up<br>
by something you wrote in your "Cortical Integration"<br>
paper:<br>
<p>
"The thought was to get as simple a world as<br>
possible, yet one that had enough complexity to allow<br>
an illustration of the principles behind the system."  <br>
<p>
I tend to read between the lines and look for all the<br>
exceptions rather than stick to the basics of the<br>
specific scenario being postulated, immediately<br>
trying to fit it into my own model of reality.  I<br>
wonder if that’s a symptom or example of the<br>
unconstrained curiosity you’re making a case against;<br>
or, perhaps, it’s just a desire to skip the hard work<br>
of logical analysis and try too soon for some sort of<br>
artistic integration.<br>
