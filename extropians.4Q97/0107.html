I am interested in trading tapes of Leonard Peikoff's radio show <br>
Sundays 11A.M to 1P.M. <br>
P.S.T. <br>
I am especially interested in a copy of the October fifth show.<br>
<p>
I would also like to talk with anyone who receives his radio program by<br>
satellite.<br>
If you have a full sized (not mini TV) satellite dish, and want to trade,<br>
please phone and leave message with your phone number at (650) 604-5720<br>
and I will call you on my $. <br>
If you can't call please e-mail to<br>
jims@eos.arc.nasa.gov<br>
<p>
The show is on satellite c1, transponder 14, audio over video, 7.5mhz.<br>
<p>
I have tapes of the show through 9-28, and want to acquire the first<br>
hour, which will be blacked out in L.A starting 10-5.<br>
<p>
If you live near L.A, you could call KIEV (213) 245-2388, and protest the<br>
loss of the first hour. They are charging the Ayn Rand institute far more<br>
than any of the other stations, and the institute can not afford the first <br>
hour.<br>
