<i>&gt; In Lojban,</i><br>

<i>&gt; which expresses some relationship among one or more things, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments to the predicate, which are the things which stand in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship; </i><br>
<p>
Nouns and verbs _are_ roles, not absolutes. As I tried to make clear<br>
before, such terms are not convenient categories for describing word<br>
classes but functioning units of the language-machine.  English is pretty<br>
good at making verbs out of nouns (to benchmark, to chair (be a chairman),<br>
to contact, to progress, to host --some of these have been used as verbs<br>
so long we forget they came from nouns and were once decried as debasing<br>
the language); other languages have less fluidity between categories.  The<br>
ease with which Lojban transfers meaning-words from one part of speech to<br>
another is a great design feature which I'm sure can be used to great<br>
literary effect. <br>
<p>
Dr Moore, the chair, chairs in his chair.<br>
<p>
 Nevertheless, when I use "chair" to refer to the person<br>
in charge of a department, that's a noun.  When I use "chair" to refer to<br>
the _act_ of that person being in charge, that's a verb. Nothing inherent,<br>
just the way our language module processes the message. English does this<br>
occasionally; Lojban does it regularly; Lojban still has nouns and verbs. <br>
<p>
  Those arguments can be thought of playing the noun<br>
<i>&gt; role, and the predicate the verb role, but there are some distinctions</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are not merely cosmetic: first, any content-word in Lojban can</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve either role (and other roles), and there is are prototypical</i><br>
<i>&gt; noun-verb as actor-action assumptions built in to the grammar of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; language as there are with all natural languages. </i><br>
<p>
How is recognizing actor-actor assumptions different from recognizing<br>
nouns and verbs?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I point to a dog in English and wish to express to you that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular existent stands in the relationship "dog" (to itself,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there being no other arguments to this particular predication), I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to squeeze that predicate into actor-action form by making a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "verb" called "be", and having the thing take that pseudo-action</i><br>
<i>&gt; upon the "recipient" of the action, "dog": "This is a dog".  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lojban, the predicate-word "dog" asserts that its argument stands</i><br>
<i>&gt; in that relationship, period.  "ti gerku".</i><br>
<p>
Copula verbs (to be, to seem, to resemble, etc.) are a poor choice, since<br>
all the metaphorical action they show is a = a.  There are plenty of<br>
languages, such as Spanish, Latin, or ancient Greek, where the copula is<br>
strictly optional.  Speaking Greek, I could point to my girlfriend and say<br>
 _      _       _      _<br>
hede gyne      hede gyne estin<br>
this a woman   this a woman is.<br>
<p>
Both, in English, would be "This is a woman;" arbitrarily, English cannot<br>
drop the copula.  It's a surface detail.  Lojban doesn't need an explicit<br>
copula to show a = a relationships; so what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Words for predicates like "go", "blue", "chair", "longer", etc.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; are all identical in form as far as the language is concerned;</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course some uses of them are semantically incomprehensible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but structurally they are all interchangeable:</i><br>
<p>
That's the point of natural language's distinction between verbs and<br>
nouns --it is semantically incomprehensible to transfer some meanings<br>
to different functions.  We can do it in any natural language though;<br>
consider "I sky the blueness while you ocean the door."  Structurally this<br>
is fine, even though English does not (as far as I know) have any<br>
verb-roles for sky or ocean;  using our ability to apply multiple  mental<br>
modules at once, generally known as metaphor or analogy, we could come up<br>
with such meanings. All Lojban does is make the metaphorical or logical<br>
relationship less cumbersome.  As I have said, Lojban's syntax is<br>
convenient; it is not a different way of processing.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Certainly the concepts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; actor/action are meaningful concepts; no one argues that.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; those concepts are simply not central to Lojban in the way they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are to natural languages.  </i><br>
<p>
Sure they are; the structure just doens't mark the verbing or nounness by<br>
adding morphemes directly to the root, morphemes that say "hey, I'm a<br>
verb" or "hey, I'm a noun."  We process the meaning the same way; surface<br>
details are relevant to Universal Grammar only insofar as they demonstrate<br>
the underlying relationships.<br>
<p>
Does anyone on this list know Chinese?  A language more fully isolating<br>
than English would be useful for demonstrations.<br>
