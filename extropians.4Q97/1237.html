Wait a minute. I thought that Godel proved that any sufficiently<br>
complex set of axioms (i.e., sufficient to use as a basis for<br>
everyday mathematics) was provably incomplete or provably inconsistent.<br>
A consistent system is one in which there is no statment which is<br>
both provably true and provably false. A system that is complete<br>
can prove that any statement in the system is either true or false.<br>
It's trivial to prove that this implies that there are an infinite<br>
number of undecidable statements in the system. Further, you can<br>
choose to generate an infinite number of new consistent systems<br>
by adding one of the undecidable statements as a new axiom. So,<br>
if you like the Continuum Hypothesis, and it is provably undecidable<br>
under the accepted axioms of set theory, you are free to create a<br>
new consistent system by adding the CH as an axiom.<br>
<p>
How am I supposed to go from this to Penrose's conclusion? Sounds<br>
crazy to me.<br>
