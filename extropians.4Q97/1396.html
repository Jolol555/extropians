This is where my opinion diverges.  I already have a genetic copy.  He<br>
is not a clone, but a twin.  If someone wanted to shoot me in the head,<br>
I would violently oppose this plan.  The continued existance of my<br>
"copy" does not make me feel comfortable with my death.<br>
<p>
Even if my twin could be modified by a plastic surgeon to look exactly<br>
like me, I still wouldn't want to die.  Even if you recorded my exact<br>
brain state, and reset his brain to that exact configuration, I would<br>
still not want to die.<br>
<p>
Note that I am not saying that he is not me, or that he is not another<br>
instantiation of "me".  These are semantic word games which don't really<br>
matter.  I just still desire to continue experiencing life.  Knowledge<br>
that another person very similar to me or exactly like me will continue<br>
to experience life does not change my opinion.  My twin has not directly<br>
affected my subjective experience of life up till now.  Even modifying<br>
him to be exactly like me does not change my subjective experience of<br>
life.  In fact, you could modify him without my knowledge. I still would<br>
oppose my personal death.  I don't know how making my twin brother more<br>
like me makes it any more acceptable for me to die.  If you told me that<br>
you had modified my brother to be exactly like me, I still don't see why<br>
I would change my mind and let you shoot me.  Even if I really believed<br>
that you actually accomplished what you claimed, I still wouldn't change<br>
my mind.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that of<br>
those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of them?  I<br>
am curious to find out why I am not thinking the way other people are. <br>
Maybe it is my own experience with my own copy (twin) that makes me<br>
skeptical of this approach?<br>
