I had an idea that might help ExI membership.<br>
<p>
What if ExI started a mutual fund that was only available as a service<br>
to ExI members.  The Extropian fund would provide ExI members an<br>
opportunity to actively direct capital towards companies that promote<br>
Extropian principles, and hopefully earn a good return on their<br>
investment.  An Extropian fund might increase membership and public<br>
awareness.  The unique perspectives that Extropians have on future<br>
social and economic trends could prove useful in developing an<br>
investment strategy.  Who else would be more qualified to manage our<br>
investments should we find ourselves hanging on the eve of singularity? <br>
<p>
I don't know anything about the technical or legal aspects of starting a<br>
mutual fund, or how much start up capital it takes.  Would it be<br>
appropriate for ExI to take on such an endeavor?  Anyone have any<br>
comments on this idea?  <br>
