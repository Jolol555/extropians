<i>&gt; I've attempted to show that external costs may exist, with all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; attendant ramifications for efficiency. If I can show guns are</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficient economically speaking, then I can argue that the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep and bear arms should probably not include guns. If I can show that</i><br>
<i>&gt; external benefits make guns even more efficient, then I can argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; more guns should be produced. Either way, every argument for or against</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun control implicates practicality. </i><br>
<p>
Given this, what do you think should replace guns? If access to force is<br>
necessary, but guns are not the most appropriate force, what do you think<br>
should replace guns?<br>
<p>
I'm not sold on the force issue, myself. I'd rather be a turtle than a<br>
tiger (well, only insofar as this silly force argument defines the issue,<br>
I'd rather be a tree or an elemental or such), but there seems to be quite<br>
a lack of useful armour other than distance compared to the force which can<br>
be mustered. But I don't own guns, live in a country where guns are now<br>
very heavily regulated (and have zero problem with it) and am in no great<br>
fear of ever coming across one in a life-threatening circumstance unless<br>
I travel overseas, really. I don't deny that use of force could be required<br>
in some circumstances, but I'm not sure that firearms are the right force<br>
to use. Should we scale up or scale down? Knives or nukes? <br>
