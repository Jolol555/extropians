A problem with the original question, which I<br>
paraphrase:<br>
<p>
"If we could re-make society from scratch, what rules<br>
would we devise for society?"<br>
<p>
is that it implies that there is only one society.<br>
"Societies" are like "sets" in set theory; there are<br>
as many different societies as you care to define.<br>
<p>
Thus, I argue that a better question is:<br>
<p>
"If we could begin a new society from scratch, what<br>
rules would we devise for the society?"<br>
<p>
Stated this way, it seems a more commonplace<br>
question: people are creating new societies all of<br>
the time.<br>
<p>
Not that I don't understand the spirit and intention<br>
of the original question, which I think was to spark<br>
a discussion of what sort of rules a new libertarian<br>
society would have. However, I do think that if we<br>
pretend that we could ever truly recreate the<br>
"society of all beings", we would be wasting our time.<br>
<p>
!!!---!!!<br>
<p>
Libertarians frequently forget that the rules of<br>
existing societies are a product of memetic<br>
evolution; that is, those rules were created for good<br>
reasons. Some of the rules are obsolete, and some of<br>
them were bad from the start, but we should keep in<br>
mind that our ancestors were not idiots; their rules<br>
got us to the brink of a transhuman existence. I<br>
would no sooner throw out all the rules of society<br>
wholesale than I would erase all of my DNA at once.<br>
Life is complicated; deal with it.<br>
<p>
Libertarians also frequently forget that people have<br>
the following right:<br>
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORM AND JOIN SOCIETIES IN<br>
WHICH CERTAIN FREEOMS ARE LIMITED, PROVIDED THAT THE<br>
LIMITATIONS ON THEIR FREEDOM DO NOT PREVENT THEM FROM<br>
BEING ABLE TO LEAVE THE SOCIETY AFTER JOINING IT.<br>
<p>
When people react negatively to libertarian ideas<br>
about society, they are frequently reacting against<br>
what they perceive to be a threat to this right. Some<br>
people just don't WANT to "live in" a society where<br>
people are free to use crack cocaine, for example. If<br>
libertarian memes are to thrive, this right must be<br>
addressed. The way to address them ultimately<br>
involves a sort of "set theory" of societies. (They<br>
need to define to what extent they would "live in" a<br>
society of crack users if the laws were changed, and<br>
whether it would be worse than the way they already<br>
"live in" a society that includes crack users.)<br>
Unfortunately, it becomes pretty complicated.<br>
