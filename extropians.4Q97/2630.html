<i>&gt; &gt;Indeed.  You can make a functional handgun with standard machine tools,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I've heard.  It won't be professional quality, it might break after a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;few hundred shots, but it'll suffice to mug someone.  Or kill.  How can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you eliminate such guns?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've seen some hand-made Malaysian handguns; pretty ugly copies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Colt 1911 and Browning Hi-Power, but workable. I've also seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; photographs of Thompson submachineguns built in the Vietnamese</i><br>
<i>&gt; jungle. Modern weapons are probably even easier, as they're often</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed for manufacture under license in the third world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Guns are simple technology; anyone who thinks they can be eliminated</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a fool. If you want one, you can make one or buy one; in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; buying illegally may well be both cheaper and easier. A few years ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; a British shopkeeper was locked up for shooting a robber with an illegal</i><br>
<i>&gt; .32 handgun, which cost him $60. I checked the ads in a British gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; magazine at the time and couldn't find a single legal handgun at</i><br>
<i>&gt; that price.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
During WWII, one of the OSS's more successful programs in the continent<br>
was to commission the production of several million cheap single shot<br>
pistols, which they dropped over Poland initially, and France later, for<br>
resistance fighters to arm themselves with. While at a cost of $2.50,<br>
the stamped metal gun was not good for many shots, the point was to use<br>
it to ambush lone soldiers in order to acquire their weapons once they<br>
had been dispatched with. Today these weapons are considered collectors<br>
pieces.<br>
