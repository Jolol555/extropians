How about refuelling time? My one-way commute probably takes around<br>
20-30 kWh of energy. If you're using PVs to recharge, then say 250<br>
W/m^2, which means I need 80-120 square-meter-hours to recharge the<br>
car to get home; and since I can't recharge it at night, we'd have<br>
to double that so I could get back in the morning. So to recharge it<br>
in the time I'm at work I'd need 20-30 square meters of panels, and<br>
I'd have to hope for a sunny day. Standard residential electricity <br>
supply would take 16-24 hours to recharge.<br>
<p>
In comparison, I fill my car with gas every three or four days, and <br>
it takes about five minutes. The only competitive system for a<br>
purely electric car is a complete battery-swap and I can't see gas<br>
stations wanting to do that in a hurry. Fuel cells seem like the only <br>
realistic option.<br>
