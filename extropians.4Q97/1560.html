  IAN: It seems that every media outlet <br>
  in the Western world can tell a lie, <br>
  and ostensibly any number of lies, <br>
  yet Abraham Moses Genen would only <br>
  see wrong in he who questioned the <br>
  authorities and thus was the target<br>
  of such apparently justifed lies.<br>
<p>
  The authorities and media are<br>
  free to lie at will, but woe<br>
  unto he who dares to <br>
  question the divine rights<br>
  of authority. Except the edict<br>
  of authority without question,<br>
  or suffer the slings of ad hominem,<br>
  ridicule and threats of violence. <br>
  Except their proclamations  without<br>
  resistance or face the retribution<br>
  of universal slander. Such is what<br>
  it takes to ensure unswerving <br>
  obedience to authority.<br>
  <br>
  Abraham Moses Genen does not <br>
  need to question the FBI &amp; CIA,<br>
  for he has faith in them, I do not.<br>
<p>
  Abraham Moses Genen needs to <br>
  ridicule as mentally deranged <br>
  he who questiond the FBI &amp; CIA, <br>
  yet I do not need to impugn <br>
  the sanity of those who <br>
  do not question.<br>
<p>
  If we shoot arrows at that which <br>
  we fear, then Abraham Moses Genen<br>
  fears the questioning of authority.<br>
  I believe that Extropians should not<br>
  and do not fear but  P R O M O T E <br>
  the questioning of authority.<br>
<p>
  My questioning of the investigation<br>
  of TWA 800 by the authorities has <br>
  been careful and responsible, <br>
  reckless only to the degree <br>
  I failed to realize the <br>
  attacks and threats <br>
  I would suffer.<br>
<p>
  Where has my contribution to the <br>
  process of questioning authority<br>
  failed to meet high standards:<br>
 <br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm</a><br>
<p>
  None can show an error, falsehood,<br>
  or fabrication even as they sling<br>
  mud and charges of fraud. These<br>
  people assault not just myself,<br>
  but the process of free inquiry.<br>
<p>
