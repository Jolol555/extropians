 (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)<br>
<p>
We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't know.<br>
Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the same. Someone on<br>
the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead but can't tell whether<br>
it's something solid or just a slight thickening of the fog.<br>
<p>
Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge, whatever...) and<br>
the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's not going to slow down<br>
because some backseater 'thinks' he sees something. So here we are rushing<br>
toward an object that could be anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall<br>
of concrete. After some discussion the still unclear object is now to close<br>
for a full stop, the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what happens' or<br>
the ask the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is' at the lowest speed<br>
possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize the damage (if any).<br>
<p>
<p>
An international panel of scientists have some pretty good theories that<br>
something will happen to the global climate due to the usage of fossile<br>
fuels (the only countries that don't agree with the IPCC-reports are a few<br>
OPEC-members). Increased downward infrared flux trough increased CO2<br>
concentration is a well-accepted fact (and maybe a way to terraform Mars<br>
someday). The precise effects on the global climate system cannot be<br>
estimated at this point, it may take another 10 to 15 years to find<br>
conclusive evidence for (or against) a human-induced climatechange. But: if<br>
nothing is done before then it may very well be too late do to anything.<br>
<p>
Given the fact that we have a resonable indication that something is going<br>
to happen that _may_ be very damaging to to the only habitable planet we<br>
have it does not seem unreasonable to try to do something (IMHO).<br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe we could somehow include the cost of bonding the CO2 again (by<br>
reforrestation) in the price of gasoline or electricity, as an alternative<br>
for complex regulation. That way anybody can drive (&amp; fly) as much as<br>
he/she want as long as the true global cost of 'closed-cycle' consumption<br>
is paid. The funds could be used (by oilcompanies?) to plant trees that<br>
will bond atmospheric carbon or put into energy research.<br>
<p>
