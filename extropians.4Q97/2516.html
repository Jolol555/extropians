<i>&gt; &gt;BTW. I don't think you will find many Europeans on the list, who find</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, that's a lot more to do with propaganda than anything else. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; grew up in England as a typical anti-gunner, then started shooting and</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to shooters and realised that what I'd been taught was just</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonsense. One thing I liked about America was being able to go to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; friend's house and shoot beer-bottles in his garden, without the kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of hideous paranoia we see in Europe; IMHO it's far more civilised.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for gun-ownership I don't own any, but I do have an IPSC Practical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pistol competition license and would be out shooting if the assholes</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the British government hadn't banned handguns while I was away. Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course I might do a conversion course and get a semi-auto shotgun</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead; quite why the government considers this less 'dangerous' than</i><br>
<i>&gt; a handgun is beyond me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Frankly I consider gun ownership one of the pillars of a free society,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in the long-term I'll be moving somewhere where shooters aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; treated like scum.</i><br>
<p>
If you happen to move to the New England area, I'd be happy to sponsor<br>
you in my gun club, help you find suitable equipment, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I was highly amused by a radio news report a few days ago that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government are having a 'laser pointer amnesty' because people</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been using them to dazzle drivers; don't know if they've killed</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone yet. Looks like British people can't be trusted with anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; these days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
SOunds like more "save us from ourselves" stupidity.<br>
