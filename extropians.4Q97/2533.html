<i>&gt; &gt; What does TANSTAAFL! mean and what is a fnord?</i><br>
<p>
TANSTAAFL is an acronym which most people get from Robert Heinlein's <br>
book "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" or from another source derivative <br>
therefrom.  I don't know if Heinlein originated it or not.  It stands <br>
for:<br>
<p>
There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch<br>
<p>
Fnord is, in the Wilson/Shea trilogy "Illuminatus", a meaningless <br>
word that is printed scattered through the text of most published <br>
matter.  In the world of this fantasy/science-fiction/parody series, <br>
children are trained using hypnotic techniques to not see this word.  <br>
This creates a conflict within the brain, a source of stress.  The <br>
authorities (the ones that are aware of the fnords) control the <br>
reader's reaction to any printed matter by controlling the ratio of <br>
fnords to other words -- something completely free of fnords is so <br>
unusual that a positive emotional reaction is virtually guaranteed, <br>
whereas anything critical of the government is guaranteed to contain <br>
a lot of fnords to generate a strong negative reaction.<br>
