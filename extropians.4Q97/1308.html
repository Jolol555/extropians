<i>&gt; I'd like to agree that there is no way for proving the CH</i><br>

<i>&gt; to show that a proof construct to prove or disprove CH will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be either incomplete or inconsistent,thus a never-ending story</i><br>
<i>&gt; ( just like this discussion on INFINITIES seems to heading towards</i><br>
<i>&gt; some infinite point....hey hey hey )</i><br>
<p>
Kind of hard to extract meaning with all the ellipses... not sure where<br>
thoughts start or end... godel's theorem wasn't used to prove the ch<br>
was unprovable... didn't have anything to do with that, except godel<br>
the man was interested... proof was by models... find a way of modelling<br>
axioms+ch within standard theory, no problems... find a way of modelling<br>
axioms+opposite of ch within standard theory, no problems... kind of like<br>
how it was done with noneuclidean geometry, capische... say, this is<br>
sure easy... i see why people post like this... no need to organize or<br>
anything... hope you're getting a lot of useful info out of this...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Am I making any sense here,...Let me try to put it in another way...</i><br>
<i>&gt; a quasi-layman approach,... to say just like the Quantum Physics says</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we cannot determine exactly one property of a particle without</i><br>
<i>&gt; losing the accuracy of another property of the same measured partical</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...can be said to be analogous to Godel's Incompleteness theorem</i><br>
<i>&gt; which says one can never generate a complete theory without</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconststencies and vici-versa.....!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; So just like adding one to one equals two on paper</i><br>
<i>&gt; is actualize by puting one apple beside another making 2 apples....!</i><br>
<p>
Don't think these have anything to do with each other... any more than<br>
any other situation which has two alternatives... qm lets you trade off<br>
the accuracy of measurements of one property against accuracy of other...<br>
it's continuous... godel's theorem is all or none... besides, nobody is<br>
interested in inconsistent axiom sets... they don't really count... so<br>
godel's theorem really just says that no sufficiently complex theory is<br>
complete... it's not really a duality... also this is the old way of<br>
looking at qm... lots of us like many worlds...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does Godel put a limit to what we can actually say about CH and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other related matters,....I think it does ?! Pls help out</i><br>
<i>&gt; ( if so put a limt to this discussion on Infinities or mine !? )</i><br>
<p>
No, godel's theorem is not really practical... doesn't actually generate<br>
any practical undecidable propositions... all are monstro massive...<br>
main point is philosophical that such must exist... in practice have to<br>
do it the old fashioned way... have to prove the proposition undecidable...<br>
sometime i'll tell you how it was done for noneuclidean geometry... really<br>
good story... unfortunately these ellipses are too small to contain it...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not to lose sight of our extropian objectives, is how these</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinities or INFINITIES will even affect our extropian objectives</i><br>
<i>&gt; or put limits or no limits to our objectives,....</i><br>
<p>
Some relation to quantum computing... theoretically a quantum state can have<br>
infinite information... not just aleph null, but real numbers... some people<br>
think this is much more than aleph null... in practice environmental noise<br>
probably makes it finite... but maybe if the whole universe were your state...<br>
there'd be no environment... then maybe you could go beyond aleph null in<br>
your calculations... just a crazy thought... gotta watch these ellipses...<br>
that means three dots btw... think i'm getting dizzy... better stop now...<br>
<p>
Wow, what a trip.<br>
