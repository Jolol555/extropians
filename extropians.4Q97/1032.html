<i>&gt; My experience has been (and I hope I don't offend anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; by saying this) that scientist-types tend to be more suspicious of</i><br>
<i>&gt; expectation and its potential to foil perception (e.g., interpretation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the implications of an empirical experiment), whereas humanist-types</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to be more permissive of developing new expectations and</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing them to guide one's perceptions (e.g., a reinterpretation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of an important work of literature).</i><br>
<p>
Those of you familiar with the _Principia Discordia_ will remember this<br>
bit:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN</i><br>
<i>&gt; IN FIVES, OR ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES</i><br>
<i>&gt; OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; APPROPRIATE TO FIVE.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Law of Fives is never wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."</i><br>
<p>
I've got a sneaky suspicion that "expectation enables perception" is<br>
exactly what the above snippet is trying to suggest. Orr's Law: what the<br>
Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. Interesting, especially in light of the<br>
"proofs" for much of the pseudo-science rampant on the net. One of the<br>
exercises at the end of Chapter One of Prometheus Rising is to visualize<br>
finding a quarter on the road. Then go walking, still visualizing, and see<br>
how long it takes you to find one. Now when you do, is it the power of your<br>
mind that made the quarter show up, or was it there all along? The point of<br>
the exercise is not the answer you give, but the act of defending both<br>
positions.<br>
<p>
I would hazard that most on this list would find it easy to defend the<br>
position that the quarter was always there and you just happened to be<br>
looking at the right time. What is not so easy for the critical rationalist<br>
is a defense of the "mind power" position. Yet, there are people who defend<br>
such positions everyday, positions which to many of us would seem<br>
completely untenable based upon logic and Occam's razor.<br>
<p>
I'm extremely interested in what the universe looks like to such people --<br>
and for that matter, to any other person who differs from me in a<br>
significant way. For one, I'll throw in with Nicholas Bostrom's view of a<br>
need for polymaths in the mainstream public sphere<br>
(<a href="http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/predict.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/predict.htm</a>) and add to it the suggestion that<br>
not only must the relevant philosopher of today be broadly educated across<br>
disciplines, but also must be able to think creatively across perceptual<br>
frameworks. A scientist's view of a particular trend is often quite<br>
different than the politician (third circuit thinking versus second circuit<br>
thinking). There is no way (yet) to determine with absolute certainty whose<br>
perceptions are closer to objective reality and accordingly more accurate,<br>
so a polymath with the ability to perceive what *BOTH* people perceive is<br>
that much closer to an accurate statement about the trend.<br>
<p>
Again, I don't know if this is possible, and I want to try a few of the<br>
exercises in PR to see where they take me. If anyone is interested in doing<br>
the same, I'd be psyched to discuss privately.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the things I like about the phrase "expectation foils</i><br>
<i>&gt; perception" is that having this expectation about things for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; while eventually enables one to see that expectation also enables</i><br>
<i>&gt; perception.  And after rounding this particular epistemological</i><br>
<i>&gt; loop enough times, some find it easier to deploy their filters</i><br>
<i>&gt; deliberately, rather than themselves being deployed by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; built-in filter-reflexes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Right. I like the way you put that. I envision an arsenal of perceptual<br>
filters deployable and retractable in any combination. Sort of like holding<br>
control variables constant while you reassess the data. With so many<br>
configurable filters, a data set represents orders of magnitude more<br>
information than it originally would have with a single viewpoint evolved<br>
through a long process of experiential imprints. "No, can't make it to the<br>
meeting, I was planning on watching Schindler's List from the viewpoint of<br>
a Nazi Stormtrooper this afternoon ..."<br>
