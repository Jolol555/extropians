<i>&gt; &gt;Please explain to me how you come up with the figures of  80-95% of</i><br>

<i>&gt; Hmm, you're right.  I was looking at the "other" column, which fluctuates</i><br>

<i>&gt; is not being counted, and I don't know what it is.  But you're right</i><br>
<i>&gt; that if you add up the columns "handguns" and "firearms", the numbers</i><br>

<i>&gt; As I've said, those may be valid reasons for wanting to own a gun.  And,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;There are other differences between the US and the other</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Another big factor I can't identify in words, but it is definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;related to the Canadian psyche and is possibly the same reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;during the American Revolution, the Canadians did not join in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;revolt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True.  As a friend of mine puts it, "Canada *exists* primarily for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the purpose of not being the United States."  Before the American</i><br>
<i>&gt; Revolution, Canada was just as much a French colony as a British</i><br>
<i>&gt; one.  Then the "United Empire Loyalists" fled north to Canada during</i><br>
<i>&gt; and after the American Revolution, and from that point on, they (we?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; were the majority, and have loved to define Canada as "not American"</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever since.  One of Canada's most proud differences from the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt; our lower rate of violence.  Many people think this is *because* we</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have easy access to guns.  I don't think it's that simple, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's probably a factor.  I think a larger factor is simply our culture,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which *tries* to be less violent than the US simply because it's one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the most obvious ways we can differentiate ourselves from the US.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which leads me to...</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I think the best explanation for the violence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;US compared to Canada is culture.  Americans began their country by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fighting, Canadians just waited it out until we were *given* independence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Which was the better strategy?  Who cares, but the point is that this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reflection of cultural differences (which I think are slowly blurring)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;One important motivator for Canadians to avoid violence is that many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Canadians pride themselves on being as un-American as they can, and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Canadians see Americans as violent (just look at all the movies that come</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;out of Hollywood!)  Hopefully, the Canadian tendency towards nonviolent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;solutions will rub off on the US, and the US tendency to prize individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;liberty will rub off on Canada</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would be nice, but unforunately the exact opposite is happening.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Canada is becoming more violent, while the US is becoming less free.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In Toronto, for example, overall crime rates have dropped slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the past few years, but *violent* crime has gone up.  I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure why.  Perhaps the violent culture of our Big Brother to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; south is finally rubbing off on us.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I think your concept of an ethnically homogenous Canada either comes from</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree wholeheartedly.  Parts of Canada are indeed very homogeneous;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;It is interesting that you said absolutely nothing about the Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;DC Murder rates.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Never ascribe to malice what can adequately explained by ignorance."</i><br>
<i>&gt; I didn't mention them because I didn't have them handy, and I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; familiar with them in any case.  I don't claim to be an expert on</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun use in any part of the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Studies of gun crime in the US show that gun crime rates are highest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;areas that have the most restrictive gun control laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another interesting data point indicating that the US is generally</i><br>
<i>&gt; more violent than other first-world nations, since most other countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; have more restrictive gun control laws than *anywhere* in the US, yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun crime rates are *not* higher than in the US.  I'm not flinging</i><br>
<i>&gt; mud here, I'm just emphasizing again that the extra freedoms that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have come at a cost of a more violent culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Now, on the overall murder rates being higher, I won't debate, its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;obvious that a free society like ours will tend to grant its citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the liberty to be able to commit the sort of crimes involved, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;societies like those in europe, descended from fuedal systems in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;only the aristocracy had a right to bear arms, are obviously not free,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh?  Why are they obviously not free?  And to what extend freedom?  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; are free to travel as we please, within and between countries; we vote</i><br>
<i>&gt; for our leaders, just as you do; we have (as a practical matter)</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom of speech, religion, association, and the press, just as the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; is supposed to have.  (Of course there are problems, but legally and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in practice we have similar rights.)  I don't know about the European</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, but Canada has a Charter of Rights and Freedoms as part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; our Constitution (contrary to what somebody said a few days back).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Certainly there are minor differences of degree and kind in the details,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I would hardly call Canada or any of the western European countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; "obviously not free".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;[obviously not free,]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in that the government protects the citizens from themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that your definition of "free" lies solely in the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bear arms.  I believe this is an extremely narrow view.  Are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other freedoms I mention above worth nothing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't get me wrong.  I don't believe, a priori, that gun ownership is</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad.  As I've said, I've been on a rifle team where strict safety</i><br>
<i>&gt; procedures were taught.  People on this list (including yourself)</i><br>
<i>&gt; have complained how gun owners are often portrayed as madmen.  Would</i><br>
<i>&gt; you complain if, for example, the *only* law that stood between you</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a gun was a requirement to take a safety course?  Would that</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an opprossive law leading to a state that is "obviously not free"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [I'm trying to figure out if we're talking at cross-pursposes here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or if we really do have a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes</i><br>
<i>&gt; "freedom".]</i><br>
<p>
SHow me one western european country, and you can include Canada, where<br>
the national Constitution, if one happens to exist, explicitly<br>
acknowledges that all political power derives from individuals, and is<br>
delegated to the government by the consent of the people. France might<br>
be one, but all of the others have peacefully transformed themselves<br>
from monarchies to constitutional monarchies, to parliamentary<br>
democracies, and in the fine print, you will always find a clause that<br>
states that ultimate political power has been granted by God to the<br>
monarchy, and the monarchy has delegated this to the people. Any nation<br>
that has this Natural Law "divine right of kings" clause is a nation<br>
where the people are NOT free, they are merely being treated "extra<br>
special" by the true power. Canada, which peacefully was granted<br>
independence by the British monarchy, acknowledges that their government<br>
exists by the grace and good will of the British crown.<br>
<p>
The British government, as peaceful and democratic as it is, is, after<br>
all, a constitutional monarchy, in which the sovreign power is in the<br>
body of the monarch, not in the people or in the parliament. There is no<br>
freedom of speech or any other officially recognised rights that belong<br>
to or originate from the people. The most that the government has is the<br>
Magna Carta, which is a 'divine right' document, no matter what its<br>
democratic implications. WHile the government does today observe human<br>
rights as a matter of practice, and as required by the UN Charter, there<br>
is no reason or legal requirement for them to do so explicitly.<br>
<p>
Non-AMericans just can't seem to understand how importatant this<br>
prinicple is, nor do many americans today. People think that if the<br>
government observes a particular political right of the people as a<br>
matter of form even though it is not legally bound to, that the people<br>
actually, legally, posess this freedom. Not so. And I am not sorry to be<br>
delivering this wakeup call, no matter how much you might deny or resist<br>
its validity.<br>
