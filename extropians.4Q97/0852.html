<p>
"Higher frequency" ? I didn't mention anything about higher frequency.<br>
(Higher frequency of what?, I should probably ask)<br>
<p>
Maybe you are thinking about the Doppler velocity techniques that <br>
astronomers have used to discover Jupiter-sized planets around <br>
other (main sequence) stars.  If so, that is completely different.<br>
I was talking about infrared excess stars. The physics involved<br>
with the IR excess stars is about energy and fluxes and heat. See the URL <br>
I gave previously (<a href="http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html">http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html</a>) for <br>
some notes about that. <br>
<p>
The Doppler velocity techniques are all about.. well doppler velocities. <br>
The techniques are similar to those used in helioseismology. <br>
<p>
Geoff Marcy's URL has some words about his planet finding <br>
techniques here:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html">http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html</a><br>
<p>
and I wrote a detailed explanation about helioseismology for<br>
my Stanford job (solar oscillations group) here:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://soi.stanford.edu/results/heliowhat.html">http://soi.stanford.edu/results/heliowhat.html</a><br>
<p>
Actually I have thought alot about calculating if the stars in<br>
Marcy et al's (Doppler) speculated planet systems also have IR excesses <br>
(I even discussed it with him a couple of years ago), but I have <br>
not done the calculations yet. It would be an interesting result <br>
(maybe someone has already done it by now).<br>
<p>
These stars that we are talking about, both the IR excess stars and<br>
and the Doppler velocity stars are all nearby: 25 parsecs or less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If we're to spend say 1 to 10</i><br>
<i>&gt;million dollars with best current technology on a dyson sphere search,</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is the radius in which we'd have a good chance of finding one if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;exists? </i><br>
<p>
You would absolutely have to have a database of stars with parallaxes.<br>
I don't know what is the Hiparccos catalog's radius for stars. If <br>
your search for Dyson spheres uses the  Wooley or Gliese catalogs<br>
to provide parallaxes, (those are the catalogs used by Fred Witteborn,<br>
my old boss at NASA-Ames, when he searched for Dyson spheres in the<br>
early 80's) then that radius would be 25 parsecs or less. <br>
<p>
There are lists around of candidate search stars for finding<br>
other planets. Geoff Marcy's group has one. The Terrestrial<br>
Planet Finder working group will have one soon. The Kepler and<br>
Darwin missions already have lists for candidate stars. Project<br>
Phoenix (SETI) has a list of candidate stars, as well. I don't know<br>
how much overlap there is, but I would be that there is a huge<br>
overlap of stars in those lists. I believe that alot of this information <br>
is available at these different groups' Web sites. <br>
<p>
This place is an excellent place to start learning about the<br>
status of finding other solar systems:<br>
