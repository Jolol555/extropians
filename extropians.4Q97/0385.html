<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Are instinctive ends subjective or objective?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Gary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What I would call instinctive ends are reserved for unreasoning animals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;infants until they reach the mental maturity to calculate in the abstract.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you saying that instincts no longer exist when one reaches mental maturity?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I believe we need to define the term, instinct, to clarify the question. As<br>
stressed in previous posts, to define is to differentiate. So, by reference<br>
to what and how do we differentiate instinct from non instinct? If instinct<br>
is a natural condition, whatever the instinct is is not subject to dismissal<br>
or alternation by personal preference. One often hears such things as "He<br>
has good instincts for the game." Or, "He instinctively applied the brake."<br>
These things are all developed reflexes, not instincts. <br>
<p>
Infant animals, including the human kind, by instinct seek to gain<br>
nourishment necessary for survival. Dogs, cats, etc. are directed by this<br>
instinct all of their lives. I.E., survival instinct. A human individual on<br>
the other hand is volitional and at some point in the maturing transition<br>
has the option to choose(within capacity) to survive or choose not survive.<br>
Although each individual is made up of characteristics, both common and<br>
individualistic, including the urges you speak of, with the onset of the<br>
ability to think in the abstract and make choices, there is no instinctive<br>
directive to determine course of action. <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Somehow, instincts just don't quite fit into the definition of "subjective."</i><br>
<p>
Granted, this is an arguable point. For sake of brevity, I didn't go into a<br>
full explanation of complete differentiation. I don't like the premise,<br>
"automatic values" as it sidesteps choice and subjective and you observe.<br>
What we really have in human infants and other animals are REACTIVE<br>
entities. Since the value is attributed by mind, although instinctively, the<br>
source puts it in the subjective realm. That it is automatic, not subject to<br>
choice, puts it in the objective realm. What we have is not a contradiction,<br>
but an evolving transition of one type of animal into another and a<br>
description of each stage as pertains to valuing. I simply do not like the<br>
term valuing in the first stage, but have no single term to represent the<br>
actual differentiation. We also have a situation of valuing as in the case<br>
of a dog with survival instinct, but chooses one type of food over another.<br>
There are separate terms needed to make a shortly worded differentiations.<br>
Right now I can't find them in the language system and have not tried to<br>
create such terms since this situation is not often discussed. In any event,<br>
considering the non explanatory generality of my statement, your objection<br>
is well warrented. However, when we leave the transition stage and deal with<br>
human adults, the mental action of subjective valuing is quite clear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They exist apart from how we feel about them. To be sure, we can control our</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive urges, but we still have them. </i><br>
<p>
These urges you speak of are as you acknowledge at the command of individual<br>
volition as to whether one does or does not act upon them. If we define<br>
instinct as not subject to volition, as was done above, the urges in<br>
question are not in the realm of instinct. This is further evidenced by the<br>
fact that certain beliefs and valutions can psychologically negate all the<br>
survival urges. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They seem more like a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;*is* which our mind perceives as an *ought*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It is a personal *is*. However, the perception of *ought* is rooted in the<br>
"impersonal" as it presupposes a course of action and behavior set up and<br>
sanctioned by something other than self. In formal religion, it is called<br>
"God." Apart from formal religion, it may be called anything, or nothing at<br>
all - except the feeling of "ought." The core question is whether the<br>
feeling of "ought" is based on fact or fallacy. In addition to the fact that<br>
"ought" is inconsistent with "is", my long term study of the situation<br>
leaves me with the conclusion that the feeling of "ought" is ALWAYS based on<br>
false beliefs. There is sometimes much difficulty in identifying these false<br>
beliefs because they often exist in the subconscious without conscious<br>
awareness of their nature or their effect on thinking and values. Since very<br>
few ever study the principles of mind to understand what they believe and<br>
why they believe it, these subconscious directive beliefs usually go<br>
undetected throughout a lifetime.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Mr. Crocker wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And be clear what I mean here: I do not wish to test an action; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;results of an action /are/ easily testable against the outcome I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;desire.  I wish to test an hypothesis about which outcome I should</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;desire, independent of any action to achieve it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
As I see it, what Mr. Crocker is saying here is that he does not contest the<br>
fact that means may be tested (proven as suited or unsuited) in respect of<br>
some end he chooses.  The challenge is to prove the end itself is a valid or<br>
invalid *should* choice. It can't be done because there is no objective<br>
*should*. The theory of objective ought is in direct contradiction of the<br>
objective fact of individual volition. Do you notice that Mr. Crocker's<br>
statements sets means as subject to proof or disproof? To prove Mr.<br>
Crocker's choice of ends as right or wrong, isn't it necessary to regard Mr.<br>
Crocker's choice of ends as means to some other end not his own? Even the<br>
words themselves throw out an "ought" as objective. To wit. Objective<br>
reality IS. To say "ought" is objective is to say objective reality IS and<br>
IS NOT. It just won't fly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You responded:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;You should desire species survival, without which we wouldn't be having this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I see your end desire stipulated and implicitly coupled with the wish that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Mr. Crocker attribute  value to the end you name.  What is missing is why he</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;should do so other than to please you. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To not be in conflict with what is probably his most basic instinctive</i><br>
<i>&gt;value. To please himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If it were an "instinctive value" it would not be subject to choice, would<br>
it? Wouldn't this mean the value already exists for Mr. Crocker and the<br>
"should" has no meaning?   As for pleasing himself, each of us seeks self<br>
interest at all times. Aren't you really presuming to decide Mr. Crocker's<br>
choice for him? Isn't this a contadiction? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Where is recognition of Mr. Crocker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;choice in the matter? The reality is that Mr. Crocker does have a choice and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to not recognize it, whether it pleases you or not, is not dealing with AS</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;IS, but denial of AS IS, which is to say, denial of the existent, Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Crocker. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;His instincts are a part of him, and yet he cannot change them through his</i><br>
<i>&gt;choices, only be in compliance or conflict with them. They are AS IS.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As concluded above, urges are not necessarily instincts as in infants, but<br>
may derived from underlying beliefs. So, there never is the question or<br>
circumstance of being in conflict with instincts since they are by nature<br>
guaranteed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;This is literally what every claim of discovered "objective value"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;does. In other words, the concept, objective value, is an illusion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;inherently anti individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instincts are an AS IS part of the individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
See above. To recap. You acknowledge that one can choose to ignore what<br>
you're calling instincts. Since you can do this by subjective choice,<br>
doesn't this reveal that what you're calling instincts are not really<br>
objective, nor an objective mandate?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non scientific terms</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality of a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;situation. Having expressed this desire, I remain aware that my end chosen</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is not the end desire of most. Consequently, I will continue to deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the real by exposing the fact that ought and should have no connection to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;objective reality except as personal preference and subjective declarations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are not instincts part of objective reality?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Yes, but the question is, what part, and how does this part relate to the<br>
issue of values? I know of no instincts of anything that supports the idea<br>
of should or ought. The belief in "ought" as consistent with objective<br>
reality, but dependent only upon a subjective feeling leaves all that<br>
believe shouting "ought" at each other without any objective, i.e,, common<br>
frame of reference to peacefully resolve the difference. Believing the<br>
"ought" is objective is a psychologial "order" to act upon it. What this<br>
action is and how it is manifested necessarily varies with each individual.<br>
One may retreat to a monastery to comtemplate the "spiritual" because he<br>
feels he "ought" to follow this course to please "God." Another may feel<br>
he\she "ought" to kill his\her children because they will be better off in<br>
"heaven". Another may feel he "ought" to devote his life to aiding the ill.<br>
Still another may feel he "ought" to eliminate racial impurity and promote<br>
racial superiority because it is "God's will." <br>
<p>
Always is the "ought" tied to something not individual, but felt to exist<br>
and be superior to idividual. Its a short step from "God's will" to "for the<br>
good of the country." Then there is "human rights", "values of society", and<br>
so on expressed or implied as a superior being to which individual is<br>
subordianted giving rise to the "ought." There are those that consciouly<br>
reject the idea of an omni god and "God's will." Some go on to reject<br>
"government" "society" as things of volition and will. Yet, after all this<br>
remains the feeling of "moral ought." Why?  Where does it come from? What<br>
end does it serve in the promotion?<br>
Whose end?<br>
<p>
The feeling is a residual from a dominant belief in a superior being and<br>
subordination of individual.  It has no name, no face, no conscious recognition.<br>
It is a haunting specter that emanates from the nearly universal and<br>
saturate philosophy of anti individual. The formal preaching and teaching,<br>
and the informal promotion of "divine abstracts", manifested not only in<br>
words, but the entire socio\economic\political system that blankets the<br>
earth, makes no concession to individual as the real. Look and listen. Where<br>
do you see or hear of individual as the absolute real? If I were to tell you<br>
that in your own mind you don't exist; not as the absolute real, not as the<br>
uncaused cause so to speak, you would probably think I'm nuts, for you are<br>
absolutely certain of your individual existence. O.K. Tell me of the source<br>
of the "moral ought" you feel to exist? Do not tell me of your ends and<br>
submit proof of means. This is not the issue. I wish to know of the common,<br>
universal, not individually designated end that must exist to give objective<br>
and definitive meaning to "ought."Can you do this without expressing or<br>
implying a "superior being" in the background as the necessary cause of the<br>
"objective value?"<br>
