I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Considering that we only have<br>
100,000 active genes, as far as anyone can tell, we start out with a<br>
rather small immunity repertoire.  But lymphocytes -- the antigen<br>
specific white blood cells -- actually have their genes rearranged as<br>
they split from a stem cell, thus making them the only somatic cells<br>
which do not have the same genome as all the other cells.  Estimates of<br>
their possible diverity range from 10^8-10^11 for B cells (blood/serum<br>
antibodies) and 10^15-10^18 for some other branch (which by elimination<br>
should be the T cells (which kill infected or tumorous cells) but I<br>
could have forgotten something.)  In the latter case there are obviously<br>
rather more possibilities than cells in the body.  More time to evolve<br>
is no inherent advantage on the pathogens side.<br>
<p>
The entire specific immune system is an excellent example of applied<br>
evolution; many new lymphocytes die due to inability to recognize MHC<br>
molecules or ability to recognize self-antigens.  B cells can change<br>
their own genomes to an effort to develop higher affinity receptors,<br>
although I forget what stage that occurs in.  Between all this, the way<br>
neurons hook up, and Hofstadter's work on creativity, I'm rather tempted<br>
to say that life is an evolutionary fractal.<br>

Homeobox sequences might be conserved not because they get special<br>
repair mechanisms, but because mutants of those genes thoroughly disable<br>
their hosts, possibly killing them in development.  That seems the<br>
simpler explanation for highly conserved sequences -- we depend on them<br>
too closely, so any variants die.<br>
<p>
And the whole point is that much DNA is not very highly conserved, and<br>
is "a day the worse for it".  That's how we evolved from prokarya.<br>
