    Obviously it's natural to have those types of feelings and be wrong.  Of<br>
course it happens more than not.  But when instance after instance occur, I<br>
tend to wonder.  And of course I can't prove to you they are false memories<br>
that happened after fact, I can only tell you honestly, that was my<br>
experience; that's what happened.  I'm not going to forget the events that<br>
happened in an instance like that.  On the contrary I remember them quite<br>
clearly.  No I didn't right anything down at the time, but when I first had<br>
that "vision" of the yellow rider truck, I did mention it to my mother, but<br>
at the time I didn't think it was overly significant, but she still can<br>
recall me mentioning it.  And also right after I put down the phone with my<br>
friend, and then came back, I told him what had happen.  I told several<br>
people directly after the incedent.  And they all can recall what I said.<br>
And as far as brains "going wrong" (whatever you exactly mean by that),<br>
perhaps that will explain some failures in attempt to reproduce in a<br>
laboratory, but what about those psychic experiences in which someone makes<br>
mention of something ahead of time and it happens to come true.  Are all of<br>
our brains "going wrong" coneviently at the same time?<br>
