Having studied with one of the founders of the thing called NLP, and having<br>
observed various practitioners at close hand, permit me to say that there<br>
are downsides present for some practitioners. And some of these<br>
practitioners are high-vis. :\<br>
<p>
In my view, the work being done by the Andreases shows significant value.<br>
<p>
Richard Bandler, and Tony Robbins, to cite two high-vis people, seem to be<br>
focused on getting the word out, and possibly on getting wealth (not that I<br>
find fault with that per se), and may be less attuned to or concerned with<br>
possible developing personality cults. They may also be aiming for "80-20"<br>
results. Buttonhole me sometime face-to-face; I've got some droll stories<br>
to relate.<br>
<p>
The last seminars I had with John Grinder and Judith Ann Delozier (as best<br>
I can recall, around 1990-1991) were very rewarding. At that time, their<br>
area of concern and approach to models/metamodels was varieties of focused<br>
attention. I think you would have enjoyed it had you been present, Anders.<br>
And the resistance those two had to cults of personality was obvious.<br>
<p>
On the third tentacle, there has been a tendency for extravagant claims to<br>
be made. I believe that some branch of the US military did some<br>
investigation into the utility of some published/promoted NLP techniques,<br>
but I doubt their applications and investigative methodology would satisfy<br>
you.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; One technology that claims to allow humans to "rescript" themselves is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).  A good book on NLP is "NLP: The New</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Technology of Achievment", by the NLP Comprehensive training team,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; edited by Steve Andreas.</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Caveat:  I've been experimenting with NLP on myself for the past few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; months, so my objectivity is quite possibly blurred.  However I must say</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that I find it both very interesting in the abstract, and very effective</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; when put to use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm a bit ambivalent about NLP. I have not yet read up heavily on it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but what I have read and tried seems to suggest that is mainly a large</i><br>
<i>&gt;toolbox of more or less different tools with no real underlying Big</i><br>
<i>&gt;Theory. That is of course not necessary as long as the tools work, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;some certainly do. But at the same time I notice the tendency for</i><br>
<i>&gt;"believers" of NLP to believe a little bit too strongly in it for my</i><br>
<i>&gt;taste - it seems to have some memetic "cult potential" (I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggest it is a real cult, just that it somehow promotes a cohesion</i><br>
<i>&gt;among NLPers and their beliefs that I find unhealthy for critical</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking and strict empirical testing). Since I also recognize that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this may just be my prejudices talking, I get even more ambivalent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are there any outside examinations of the efficiacy of NLP methods?</i><br>
