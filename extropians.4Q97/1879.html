If we look far enough out, we should see when the voids formed, and this<br>
theory would seem to predict that each void would expand rapidly from a <br>
central point.  We aren't too far from testing this prediction I think.<br>
<p>
Radical energy conservation seems a bizzare tendency to observe in *all* voids<br>
across the universe.  They obviously aren't hiding from each other, after<br>
all.  It would seem to imply they can't create new universes to explore, and <br>
so realize that their local energy is all they'll ever have.  <br>
<p>
Having neutral zones full of visibly noisy galaxies also seems odd.<br>
In neutral zones on earth, one tries to minimize activity so that it is easist<br>
to tell if someone is trying to cross.  <br>
