<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Like a broken record, I find myself spouting</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian doctrine even as I've seen the flaw in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the common application of libertarian moral theory:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If a landlord uses force to evict me, or even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the contract says if I break his rules I go to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell in the basement, libertarian doctrine does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not see this as coercion, so long as I'm free</i><br>
<i>&gt; to leave his property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The federal government is the landlord of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; property known as the United States. The rules</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the landlord  must be followed or penalty</i><br>
<i>&gt; is effected.  It is not coercion so long as</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are free to leave the U.S. property if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have a problem with the contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As we can see, the U.S. property arrangement</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not different than the "private property,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; for we are free to leave the U.S., therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; the application of U.S. law is not coercion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
However, the property claims/grants that predate the formation of the US<br>
Government are not subject to US government law as a matter of the<br>
landlord principle. Of the 13 original states, the only property which<br>
could possibly be construed as belonging to the Federal government is<br>
the District of Columbia (and a fine example of landlord stewardship<br>
they have made of that, eh?). There are also property grants to<br>
individuals that predate US claims in the Lousiana Purchase, Sewards<br>
Folly(Alaska), and the original Northwest Territory (the area  north of<br>
and between the Missisipi and Ohio rivers up to the Canadian border).<br>
<p>
In any event, for the origianl 13 states, since their state governments<br>
predate the US government, they hold original claim on property in their<br>
jurisdiction, except for that property granted to individuals directly<br>
by the King of England. For the present owners of these properties, they<br>
have inherited or bought the free association rights to maintain or<br>
secede the relationship of their property with the state and federal<br>
governments.<br>
<p>
As for states relationships to the federal gov't, New Hampshire, for<br>
example, has a Constitution that predates the US Constitution, and<br>
recognises the right of the state and local governments to secede from<br>
the union. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You do not have to sign the contact to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; compelled to abide by it. When I walk into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a store, I still have to abide by their rules</i><br>
<i>&gt; even if I did not sign a contact. Entry =&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreement with the terms of the property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus to enter a preexisting claim is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree to the rules therein, or not, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which case the landlord can use force</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to libertarian moral theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ininformed consent is not recognized. Unless the conditions of entrance<br>
are posted at the entrance, and the property owner will not allow<br>
entrance until conditions have been read and agreed to, there is no<br>
informed consent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, if a child is born in an apartment</i><br>
<i>&gt; and its parents die sometime thereafter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the landlord, in accord with libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, has the right to evict the child,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to use force against the child, even as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the child did not sign any contract.</i><br>
<p>
SO you are saying that since the parents died in the apartment, in<br>
effect abandoning the child, then under the lease, the landlord can<br>
claim the child?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertarians seem to think that they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; an inherent right to property upon which a</i><br>
<i>&gt; preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.</i><br>
<p>
Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is<br>
nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.<br>
The population was here before the government was.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only difference between the smalltime</i><br>
<i>&gt; landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet there is no libertarian rule that places</i><br>
<i>&gt; a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-</i><br>
<i>&gt; ing claims of Native Americans, but none of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the guilty are alive today. If we say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-</i><br>
<i>&gt; bably stands on once Indian territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the importance of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; lies in the utility of private property,</i><br>
<i>&gt; such that people are more prosperous when</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals are allowed maximum control of</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas that they purchase in exchange with</i><br>
<i>&gt; others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that owns a vast area wants his tenants to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosper, he will allow them a very high</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree of liberty. He will allow them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control parcels of land and trade them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What makes the market work is the ease with</i><br>
<i>&gt; which customers can exit a given establishment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What makes government not work is the difficulty</i><br>
<i>&gt; with which customers can exist the country. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes down to size. This places emphasis on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this</i><br>
<i>&gt; fixed and limited parcel of territory.</i><br>
<p>
Since the sovreign power of the US gov't is delegated by the people as<br>
individuals, if the people decide to abolish it, break it up in an<br>
anti-trust action, or make its role entirely voluntary for each and<br>
every individual, allowing people to "go armadillo" in Vinge's terms,<br>
then its legal. Since this voluntary principle already exists in the tax<br>
code and in the Social Security Act, its not unprecendented.<br>
