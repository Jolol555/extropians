<i>        &gt;mysticism regarding the non-algorithmic capabilities of minds.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Penrose's argument is that if people are algorithmic like a Turing machine  <br>
then we couldn't jump out of the system, look at ourselves and find the <br>
inadequacies in the system as Godel seemed to do it his proof. I think at the  <br>
very lowest level we are the equivalent of Turing machines, however the <br>
axioms are numerous but ridiculously simple at that level, "If you're in<br>
state A and see a 0, change it to a 1, go to state B, and move one square to <br>
the left". I don't think we can jump out of THAT system and change the basic <br>
operating principles that Turing found 60 years ago, but that very low level <br>
can't be the level the conscious mind operates. Something must be running on <br>
top of that machinery, something that has few if any axioms and so is not a <br>
formal system.<br>
<p>
Minds are problem solvers and I don't think non-algorithmic problem solving <br>
is necessarily mystical. I doubt if we use axioms like "if A and B then C"   <br>
very much,  more important are billions of heuristics like  "if A and B  then <br>
usually something close to C". <br>
<p>
Good advice is also important like "If something happened many times in the  <br>
past it will probable happen again" or " If you have several possible <br>
solutions to a problem but not enough information to prove that any of them  <br>
will work then try the simplest one first" or "if a rule of thumb seemed  <br>
like a good idea but is not solving anything, then dump that rule and look<br>
for a better one". We can jump out of THAT system.<br>
  <br>
If the mind is not a formal system, at least at the highest conscious level, <br>
then Godel does not apply to us or to a intelligent program running on a <br>
computer.<br>

<p>
<p>
I agree, if a pseudo random number generator is not good enough then  <br>
something very weird must be going on.                 <br>
