<i>&gt; This sounds wonderful.  It also brings up something I haven't been able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get a handle on.  Give thanks to who (or what)?  I fancy myself a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly rational sort, but often I feel thankful, in large ways or small.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, if I'm running late and I make it across the railroad tracks </i><br>
<i>&gt; just before the train barrier comes down, I'll sometimes say "Thank you",</i><br>
<i>&gt; and immediately stop and think "Thank who?".  "The universe" is the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been able to do.  </i><br>
<p>
Me too. I think I'm thanking the universe for all the wonderful things<br>
in it more often than most believers thank their gods :-) <br>
<p>
(Just imagine: I just saw a star through my window. Those photons must<br>
have been travelling for *years* just to be refracted in the right way<br>
to hit my eye and cause a sense of wonder. Isn't that worth thanking<br>
for? Not to mention all the nice coincidences and patterns in the world.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I don't imagine an anthropomorphized universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; giving me favors, and consciously I know it was just chance that I made</i><br>
<i>&gt; it across the tracks, so why doesn't "Oh good!" seem sufficient?</i><br>
<p>
I think it is part of our memetic and possibly genetic hardwiring to<br>
be thankful to somebody when things go well - usually, at least to a<br>
small child, it is a parent who has fixed the situation. I think this<br>
thanksgiving tendency is a holdover from previous stages of<br>
development, but it is a nice holdover.<br>
