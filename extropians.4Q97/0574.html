A year or two ago I was puzzling over Aristotle's Nichomachean<br>
Ethics, specifically his assumption about the existence of a summum<br>
bonum. A simplified interpretation of his argument is that to pursue<br>
a goal extrinsically, that is, seeking to acquire a means to a<br>
further goal (rather than seeking something desired for its own<br>
sake) partakes of drudgery.<br>
<p>
I cannot agree with this.  If the notion of a summum bonum is not<br>
inherently incoherent (and it may be), then for me the summum bonum<br>
is the generalizably extrinsic.  Skill, money, beauty, wit,<br>
attentiveness, and the other virtues of power are distinguished in<br>
that they can all be used in the pursuit of nearly any other<br>
desirable goals; and it is the generalizable extrinsicity of the<br>
virtues of power that make them so desirable to me.  I seek knowledge<br>
for its own sake in part because I've adopted (or was born with?<br>
I don't know) the scholar's trick of flooding my brain with<br>
extropiates whenever I have an "Aha!" experience.  But I've developed<br>
that aspect of my experience because although I may not know now<br>
what it is that I will want to do in the future, I do know that<br>
seeking knowledge and developing my skills and guarding my health<br>
will aid me at that later time.  Although biologically and<br>
psychologically I am wired so as (to some extent) to seek knowledge<br>
for its own sake, to value it intrinsically, from my high internal<br>
philosophical throne I suspect that if there is anything "rational"<br>
about my valuing the extropic virtues it is not something mystical<br>
and "intrinsic" to them, but their extrinsic value in being the<br>
skills that I need to acquire simply to live and continue to fluorish<br>
as a human being and animal and physical computational system with<br>
transhumanist aspirations.<br>
<p>
I have been trying to unravel this knot in my thoughts for a while<br>
now, and as you can see, I'm still not capable of explaining it<br>
very clearly.  But now seemed the time to try to mention it, since<br>
there has been a big flurry of posts dealing with moral philosophy<br>
lately.<br>
