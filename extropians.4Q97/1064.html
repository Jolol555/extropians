I'd like to share my definition because I think it works very well with<br>
Extropianism:<br>
<p>
I never considered myself religious because I never believed in anything<br>
I couldn't prove to myself. Now, I don't say "god doesn't exist", I just<br>
say I don't know and I don't care. A few years ago, I discovered that I<br>
very much like some of the ideas behind Buddhism and Hinduism. I didn't<br>
have the time to really dig into those religions and what they are all<br>
about, but one thing seemed pretty clear from the literature I've read:<br>
those religions are about EXPERIENCE instead of dogmatic laws for people<br>
not capable of living nicely together without a "god" that threatens<br>
them with "hell" if they don't obey those (very sensible) rules.<br>
<p>
I've also read a little bit about primitive cultures, who used drugs to<br>
alter their state of minds. I'm not sure if this can be called<br>
"religion" - but I like considering religion is something positive,<br>
something valuable (instead of misinterpreting it with inquisition).<br>
<p>
Reading about these rituals reminds me a lot of today's clubbing<br>
culture.<br>
<p>
I've discovered that with the right music (that I really like), and the<br>
right people (that create a good atmosphere), I can pretty well get<br>
myself into a mood of "trance". It's quite different from doing drugs,<br>
even if drug use may have inspired "going that direction". And this mood<br>
of "trance", with the whole event is what I call "religion". It's quite<br>
impossible to describe the feelings involved - but the effect is quite<br>
positive: simply a different perspective :-)<br>
<p>
It's - simply put - a form of very intense relaxation. It's the kind of<br>
thing that makes you go "wow", and two days later, you still say "wow" -<br>
but you're able to concentrate on things that are more down-to-earth.<br>
Oh, and it's rather inspiring (in terms of giving you creative ideas,<br>
both about art and solving problems).<br>
<p>
I'm not sure, but this might be pretty similar to meditating (meditating<br>
calms you down, while this pushes you real hard - but I consider both<br>
rather "spiritual").<br>
<p>
Anybody with similar experiences? I believe that I achieved this kind of<br>
control simply by seeing what was possible, and then trying to<br>
self-improve myself.<br>
<p>
later,<br>
Holger<br>
