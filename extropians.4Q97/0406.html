You are correct, Vinge's work predates the Web. However, his Novella<br>
"True Names", which predates "Marooned in Realtime", is a really neat<br>
story whose plot is centered on the awakening of the Web.<br>

<p>
Basicaliy, we are using the term in just the way you think: it's<br>
a point in the (near?) future beyond which prediction is impossible<br>
because of the development of superintelligence of some sort. Eliezer<br>
and<br>
I each have web pages on this subject. My page attempts to focus on<br>
events that may lead to the singularity, since speculation beyond<br>
the singularity is futile. My page proposes an awakening of the web<br>
as a plausible (and IMO the most likely) path to the singularity.<br>
<p>
I use the term "singularity" in deference to Vinge, who is a professor<br>
of mathematics. It's only a qualitative analogy, however: the actual<br>
simplest equations that describe the simplest qualitative predictions<br>
don't actually have mathematical singularities. A better analogy is<br>
a phase change in a supercritical liquid: I maintain that the web now<br>
has<br>
or will shortly have enough hardware to support a superhuman<br>
intelligence.<br>
Someone will build the correct software, and the web will wake up and<br>
take over. This is analogous to the situation in a container of pure<br>
water that has been cooled below th freezing point. It' still a liquid,<br>
but a slight disturbance will cause the water to freeze instantly.<br>
