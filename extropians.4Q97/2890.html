<i>&gt;&gt; Date: Sun, 21 Dec 1997 00:57:20 -0500</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; From: "L. Neil Smith" &lt;lneil@ezlink.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Subject: Please Pass It On ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     People accuse me of being a single-issue writer, a single-issue</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thinker, and a single-issue voter, but it isn't true.  What I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; chosen, in a world where there's never enough time and energy, is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; focus on the one political issue which most clearly and unmistakably</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; demonstrates what any politician -- or political philosophy -- is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; made of, right down to the creamy liquid center.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[....]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     Makes voting simpler, doesn't it?  You don't have to study every</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; issue -- health care, international trade -- all you have to do is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; use this X-ray machine, this Vulcan mind-meld, to get beyond their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; empty words and find out how politicians really feel.  About you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And that, of course, is why they hate it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ignoring the argument about guns, I find this attitude frightening and</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultish.  Ignore all fact, don't do any research, just make all your</i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions based on a single binary question.  At lease religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;fanatics have to interpret their beliefs.  This sort of commandment</i><br>
<i>&gt;requires no thought at all.</i><br>
<p>
Well, adopting it certainly requires thought, and given that you can't<br>
know everything that's relevant about each and every politician, you must<br>
limit your fact-finding in *some* way.  And of course you still have to<br>
do enough research to find out what the politicians involved in your<br>
election have voted in the past re victim disarmament, which might be<br>
quite a chore in and of itself.  I notice, btw, that to make your point,<br>
you had to cut the entire argument, and leave only the bare assertion...<br>
