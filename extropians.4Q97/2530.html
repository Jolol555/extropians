Suppose you get a sheet of paper and roll it up from bottom to top.<br>
The left side is not any closer to the right side than it was.<br>
In the same way, having compactified extra dimensions does not<br>
in itself mean that A is closer to B than it looks. I don't<br>
entirely discount the possibility of what you're talking about,<br>
but it would require geometries of a sort not presently contemplated.<br>
<p>
I think you might have a better chance trying to explain<br>
nonlocality with wormholes. In that case one doesn't need higher<br>
dimensions, just an unusual connectivity (topology) for space.<br>
Another possibility is loops in time (closed timelike curves),<br>
in which nonlocal correlation between A and B is due to a local<br>
causal chain starting at A and proceeding off to C in one <br>
temporal direction, and another local causal chain starting<br>
at C and proceeding back to B in the opposite temporal direction.<br>
(Or due to more complicated temporal zigzags.)<br>
<p>
There is a paper (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9706018">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9706018</a>)<br>
which claims to derive "the logic of quantum mechanics" from<br>
time loops in classical general relativity - but I'll only<br>
believe it when someone actually obtains the full Schroedinger<br>
equation that way.<br>
<p>
Finally, there is simply the possibility that the world truly<br>
is nonlocal - causally nonlocal, and/or ontologically nonlocal,<br>
with distributed entities whose states are not reducible to<br>
the union of localized properties. In the latter case, my<br>
question is, where does *locality* come from? At what point,<br>
under what conditions, are there truly localized entities?<br>
I don't think quantum mechanics can answer that question -<br>
in general, entanglement ends only with the "collapse of<br>
the wavefunction" or the "projection of the state vector",<br>
and that's the part of the theory whose interpretation<br>
is contentious.<br>
