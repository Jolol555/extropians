<i>&gt;&gt; What I want is to find ways of ensuring human survival even in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; very long run, even if the ethics of our descendants changes. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; problem isn't the religious nuts, the problem is the big uncertainty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; about the future.</i><br>
<p>
There's another issue: how does a "web of trust" get fostered, transferred<br>
and maintained in the face of this odd thing, foreseeable incredible stress? <br>
<p>
And a third, akin to this: what does it mean to humans or other sophonts to<br>
be "one of 'us'", and what can we do about that? What _should_ we do about<br>
that?<br>
<p>
And a fourth: given the aforementioned stresses, and the possible perceived<br>
opportunities if one defects, is there such a thing as a unified context of<br>
sufficiency? Are we stuck with a zero sum game? If we are, should we all<br>
agree to promulgate a white lie ("there's enough for everyone"), if that<br>
creates a context of sufficiency?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Reactionaries will of course be on the opposite side, forming</i><br>
<i>&gt;terrorist insurgencies to oppose the transition. Anyone who thinks the</i><br>
<i>&gt;transcendant period will not be violently dynamic is living in a fools</i><br>
<i>&gt;paradise.</i><br>
<p>
I'll add one other point: it won't be "reactionaries" alone who find<br>
themselves on the other side of the street: it'll also be anyone who's<br>
afraid they're missing the boat.<br>
<p>
It is entirely possible that during the cishuman-transhuman period,<br>
transumans may come into being, but civilization may go out the window. I<br>
would hate that.<br>
<p>
C-CAL was created to address these sorts of issues, but it's slow going...<br>
