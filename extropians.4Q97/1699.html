<i>&gt; From:          "Michael M. Butler" &lt;mbutler@comp*lib.org&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; OK... Let me say that I have doubts about uplifting something as alien as</i><br>
<i>&gt; octopi.They're mostly-solitary carnivores from a part of the ecosystem we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; very little about (the cold parts of the Pacific), and they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; startlingly-advanced cases of parallel evolution. But they're molluscs. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; could turn into an enemy a little too easily for my liking. I'd prefer trying</i><br>
<i>&gt; to uplift something a little closer to us--something mammalian. Call me a</i><br>
<i>&gt; chauvinist if you want to. I used to joke about what I thought would</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitute a _real_ "crime against humanity"--giving house cats (F.</i><br>
<i>&gt; domesticus) hands. I think uplifting octopi might be almost as bad.</i><br>
<p>
My big doubt about uplifting octopi is just how much uplifting some <br>
of them need.<br>
<p>
Not all octopi are mostly-solitary, it turns out.<br>
<p>
They live all over the oceans of the world (coastal areas only), not <br>
just the cold parts of the Pacific.  One of the largest and most <br>
intelligent species is also the dominant species of octopus in Puget <br>
Sound, which means that the uplifters working with this species have <br>
access to a large habitat area for them with complete cell-phone <br>
coverage, plus all the amenities of a major US metropolitan area <br>
about minutes (by boat) away.<br>
<p>
As for your preference for something mammalian, might I suggest <br>
wolverines?  :-)<br>
