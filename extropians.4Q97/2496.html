Well, it was discussed that the method recently exposed simply "would kill"<br>
the original living being and<br>
remake an exact copy with the same data than the original... And everybody,<br>
including the copy, would swear that it would de the same... but IT WOULD<br>
NOT !!!<br>
<p>
NEVERTHELESS, there is a TRANSFER METHOD which permits to teletransfer<br>
exactly the original individual:<br>
<p>
Just execute the teletransfer *step by step*, as if it were a series of<br>
organ transplantations. This way, we would go transfering each part,<br>
keeping something like a "telelink" with the rest of the parts that are<br>
still at the origin. F. ex.: your eyes would "go"first and your brain would<br>
"see" with the transfered eyes, and just then could destruct the original<br>
eyes.. they will have already been substituted... And so on with all the<br>
other parts of the body... Indeed, I suppose that with will be necessary<br>
just with the brain, since I do not need my original eyes &gt;&gt; just<br>
functionally equivalent ones... And more: I am not a physiologist but I am<br>
supposing that the brain has complete redundancy of functions, even if it<br>
will be necessary a momentary and recuperable "coma" while the teletranfer.<br>
Apparently, such "partitioned" teletransfer will be distance-limited by the<br>
maximum time necessary to the mentioned links be mantained... Anyway we can<br>
be teletransfered via lots of  "teletransfer substations" (like airplane<br>
connections...). <br>
<p>
In worse hypothesis, teletransfer cell by cell, ( supposing total<br>
functional redundancy)<br>
