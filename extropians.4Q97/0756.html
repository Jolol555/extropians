<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;have inherited or bought the free association rights to maintain or</i><br>
<i>&gt;secede the relationship of their property with the state and federal</i><br>
<i>&gt;governments.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: If you live on the same piece of land that <br>
 your x great grandparents lived on prior to the <br>
 formation of the U.S., I believe that you are not <br>
 subject to federal or state laws on your property.<br>
 But arguably once you pass into U.S. territory you<br>
 are subject to a tax that equals annual income tax.<br>
<p>
 But, where then in the transfer of that property <br>
 to others was sovereignity ceded to the U.S.? Hmmm.<br>
 Ergo, when did rightful ownership by the U.S. actually<br>
 begin?  I can't say, except when the property owner<br>
 accepted the validity of the Union, which I expect<br>
 most did, sooner or later. I will also except the <br>
 demand of a robber for my wallet sooner or later. <br>
<p>
 The argument I've used against the U.S. is that <br>
 just because a group of guys got together and <br>
 yelled to others "We're your government, send <br>
 us money and stuff," does not justify their<br>
 claim to such authority apart from the fact<br>
 that they could round up more guns than me. <br>
<p>
 However, the fact is that I was born into a <br>
 world upon which preexisting claims were made.<br>
 Those people whose claims were violated and who<br>
 violated them are all dead now. I have to respect<br>
 those claims that preceded me.  This is actually a<br>
 very atomist angle for a holistic logic guy like me.<br>
<p>
<p>
 There is no possibility of determining legitimate <br>
 owner of the U.S., therefore, by default, ownership<br>
 goes to the longest standing claimant, the U.S. govt.<br>
<p>
 One problem is that we expect the world to be perfect,<br>
 and anything short of that must be abolished. But it's<br>
 NEVER going to be like that. We're not going to live on<br>
 a planet with a perfect chain of ownership all the way <br>
 back to "Adam and Eve" (so to say). Philosophy must <br>
 be principled AND practical. If our current state <br>
 of justice depends upon correcting all historic <br>
 wrongs, we're never going to get to a current <br>
 justice. We have to deal with what we have,<br>
 and start with principled standards now.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for states relationships to the federal gov't, New Hampshire, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;example, has a Constitution that predates the US Constitution, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognises the right of the state and local governments to secede </i><br>
<i>&gt;from the union. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: But until they officially secede, you would be <br>
 subject to U.S. law, i.e., terms of Union membership.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; You do not have to sign the contact to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; compelled to abide by it. When I walk into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a store, I still have to abide by their rules</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; even if I did not sign a contact. Entry =&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; agreement with the terms of the property.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Thus to enter a preexisting claim is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; agree to the rules therein, or not, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which case the landlord can use force</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; according to libertarian moral theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ininformed consent is not recognized. Unless the conditions of entrance</i><br>
<i>&gt;are posted at the entrance, and the property owner will not allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;entrance until conditions have been read and agreed to, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;informed consent.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Basically, we agree. The store owner <br>
  can also inform you by removing you for a <br>
  violation, such as not wearing shoes. The <br>
  idea that the owner must post all things <br>
  you cannot do in the store on the door <br>
  and all things not posted are legal is <br>
  excessive in the extreme, yet that's <br>
  a logical outcome of your argument:<br>
  if x is not posted, x is legal. Better<br>
  to have a region in which a set of laws<br>
  apply universally, i.e., a country.<br>
<p>
  The larger point is that all newborns,<br>
  i.e., everybody, enters a world in a <br>
  state of de facto "uninformed consent,"<br>
  but that does not absolve anybody from<br>
  having to abide by preexisting claims.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, if a child is born in an apartment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and its parents die sometime thereafter,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the landlord, in accord with libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; theory, has the right to evict the child,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to use force against the child, even as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the child did not sign any contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SO you are saying that since the parents died in the apartment, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect abandoning the child, then under the lease, the landlord can</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim the child?</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: Not at all. I'm saying that the <br>
  landlord is not bound to give it free<br>
  housing. It's not like if I don't have <br>
  to give you free housing I own you. ??<br>
