<i>&gt;Uninformed consent is not recognized. Unless the conditions of entrance</i><br>
<i>&gt;are posted at the entrance, and the property owner will not allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;entrance until conditions have been read and agreed to, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;informed consent.</i><br>
<p>
Not recognized by who?  As far as the US government is concerned,<br>
every single driver in this country is liable for the "Implied Consent<br>
Law," without having signed anything.  Even ignorance of<br>
the law will not stand up in court.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, if a child is born in an apartment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and its parents die sometime thereafter,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the landlord, in accord with libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; theory, has the right to evict the child,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to use force against the child, even as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the child did not sign any contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SO you are saying that since the parents died in the apartment, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect abandoning the child, then under the lease, the landlord can</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim the child?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Libertarians seem to think that they have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; an inherent right to property upon which a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The population was here before the government was.</i><br>
<p>
This brings up my major question about Libertarianism:<br>
<p>
I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can<br>
tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one<br>
of two things would need to happen:<br>
<p>
1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  But as long as there's a<br>
profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people<br>
will always attempt to do so.<br>
<p>
2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.  Of course,<br>
this imposition would go against Libertarian values.<br>
<p>
This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:<br>
sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone<br>
to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.<br>
<p>
Can anyone talk me out of this?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The only difference between the smalltime</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Yet there is no libertarian rule that places</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ing claims of Native Americans, but none of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the guilty are alive today. If we say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bably stands on once Indian territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think the importance of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lies in the utility of private property,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; such that people are more prosperous when</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individuals are allowed maximum control of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; areas that they purchase in exchange with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that owns a vast area wants his tenants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prosper, he will allow them a very high</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; degree of liberty. He will allow them to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; control parcels of land and trade them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; What makes the market work is the ease with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which customers can exit a given establishment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; What makes government not work is the difficulty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with which customers can exist the country. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; comes down to size. This places emphasis on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fixed and limited parcel of territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since the sovreign power of the US gov't is delegated by the people as</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals, if the people decide to abolish it, break it up in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-trust action, or make its role entirely voluntary for each and</i><br>
<i>&gt;every individual, allowing people to "go armadillo" in Vinge's terms,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then its legal. Since this voluntary principle already exists in the tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;code and in the Social Security Act, its not unprecendented.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- </i><br>
<i>&gt;TANSTAAFL!!!</i><br>
<p>
Although America is theoretically a democracy, in fact we have<br>
a very complicated series of mechanisms of political control ultimately<br>
enforced by violence or threat of violence.  "The people" may not<br>
circumvent those mechanisms and remain within the existing laws.<br>
