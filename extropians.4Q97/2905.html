Yes, I was implying that participants in this discussion would choose<br>
efficiency over inefficiency. I was also implying that at any point in<br>
time there is what can be called the most efficient means to an end. I<br>
do not imply that I know what it is. I merely question, by suggesting<br>
the possible external costs of production, whether firearms are the most<br>
efficient means to the end in sight.<br>
<p>
One caveat: this "single best way" is necessarily in flux because costs<br>
and benefits change constantly, but this doesn't make the notion of a<br>
most efficient solution untenable, just a bit difficult for slow<br>
computers.<br>
<p>
I never implied I was being helpful. ;-)<br>

<i>&gt; &lt;That wasn't my point: my point was that you were talking as if an absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt; best under all circumstances could be determined. As mentioned in excerpt 1.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I'll agree with you there. There is no absolute best under all<br>
circumstances -- only under the circumstances we've frozen in time for<br>
rigorous analysis. Whether we can ever know what it is becomes another<br>
issue. <br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt; <br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps I am hallucinating. Somebody around here is conflating economics</i><br>
<i>&gt; with externalities,</i><br>

<i>&gt; and ethical-social-esthetic costs with dollars and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cents,</i><br>
<p>
I will concede that if the death of a human being has no economic<br>
effect, then I am wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and pragmatic circumstantial maxima with ideal abstraction "ceteris</i><br>
<i>&gt; paribus" maxima;</i><br>
<p>
Guilty on that score. I've tried to apply a theory of practical<br>
efficiency and all the while mistakenly assumed that efficiency *should*<br>
be the goal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and I don't think it's me.</i><br>
