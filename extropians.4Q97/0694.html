&lt; Facts are not interesting in themselves. They are<br>

Yes, so perhaps intelligence is also not an<br>
objective, consistently discriminable quality outside<br>
of some context.<br>
<p>
&lt; [Snip] I also think that John is right about<br>
intelligent people tending to be interested in more<br>
things than stupid people. This, however, I take to<br>
be a fact about human psychology, not a neccessary<br>
truth about the essense of what intelligence is; as<br>
demonstrated by the existence of highly intelligent<br>
people who don't find anything interesting, for<br>
example because they are depressed. &gt;<br>
<p>
But, it seems to me that "highly intelligent people<br>
who don't find anything interesting" are about as<br>
EFFECTIVELY intelligent as a supercomputer that is<br>
sitting idle.  When they’re not doing anything,<br>
they’re only potentially intelligent.<br>
<p>
&lt; My guess is that what produces the feeling of<br>
intrigue and interest is activity in some fairly<br>
localised center of the brain, perhaps somewhere in<br>
the limbic system. &gt;<br>
<p>
Well, the limbic STRUCTURE may be localized, but the<br>
effects "certainly circulate and are integrated into<br>
the evolving global buildup pattern" [1].  Are you<br>
suggesting that these ‘feelings’ are just some<br>
evolutionary spandrels that are no longer necessary<br>
as feedback mechanisms for other mental functions and<br>
we can therefore utilize them for whatever we like?<br>
<p>
&lt; [SNIP] What typically triggers this feeling can of<br>
course be some very high-level neocortical processing<br>
-- say, a physicist being excited by a formula<br>
because he understands its significance. But the same<br>
feeling could, in principle at least, also be<br>
triggered by means of appropriate electrical<br>
stimulation of the brain or by manipulating the<br>
emotive circuitry of the simulated intellect. In<br>
fact, the only reason that certain things naturally<br>
trigger our interest is that evolution has found the<br>
link conducive to fitness on the African savanna. &gt;<br>
<p>
Even limiting ourselves to genetic evolution, you<br>
seem to be implying that evolution has ceased over<br>
the last few hundred thousand years; if so, then<br>
please explain how white skin was "conducive to<br>
fitness on the African savanna". My point is that, on<br>
some things, evolutionary psychology is<br>
straight-forward, while on others the explanations<br>
some have provided seem clearly procrustean.<br>
<p>
&lt; I therefore see no reason why the present<br>
discrimination function by which humans discriminate<br>
between interesting ideas or facts and uninteresting<br>
ones could not be replaced by any other criterion one<br>
might come up with, including the one that *every*<br>
idea is highly interesting. &gt;<br>
<p>
I am trying to suggest that the reason this may not<br>
be so easy is that there is overlap between<br>
structural components and functional components. <br>
Creatures at our level of complexity (at least so<br>
long as their expressed features have been developed<br>
through mutual coupling with the environment, as<br>
opposed to some hard-coded, externally-imposed design<br>
- and even there, most of us know the hazards of<br>
changing one part of a program without considering<br>
its impact on other parts), can not have easily<br>
cut-and-pasted components, certainly not without some<br>
ripple effects.<br>
<p>
Not to say that hedonistic engineering should be<br>
taboo, only that it can’t assume that all, or even<br>
most, mental components can be replaced in a<br>
plug-and-play approach.<br>
<p>
&lt; Nor do I see any grounds for supposing that the<br>
present discrimination function is optimal for life<br>
in the modern world, less for the sort of life a<br>
superintelligence would live. "Optimal" should here<br>
be understood in the relative sense, as being<br>
conducive to achieving whatever other goals might be<br>
held by the individual. Instead I would expect that<br>
beings in the future, if they have the technology to<br>
do so, will adjust their curiosity to whatever level<br>
made them most efficient in achieving their other<br>
goals. If pleasure is one of these goals, then rather<br>
than making themselves inefficient by being too<br>
curios, they could leave their curiosity at the<br>
optimal level and turn on the pleasure directly,<br>
without going through the trouble of first<br>
encephalising it and associate it with a thought or<br>
an idea. &gt;<br>
<p>
But, how can curiosity (or pleasure) be some<br>
knowable-in-advance optimum that can be tuned without<br>
feedback from current goals or tasks. How can it be<br>
divorced from priority interrupts. (I’m curious, and<br>
enjoying this analysis, but my curiosity is keeping<br>
me from other tasks, which could have unpleasant<br>
consequences ;-)<br>
<p>
Taken to a perceived optimal extreme, this approach<br>
would suggest that there are no tradeoffs between<br>
various goals, that every function is isolatable. <br>
But, removing other sources and simply tuning in a<br>
‘pleasure channel’, keeping the volume low while<br>
multiplexing other tasks, seems to imply that<br>
pleasure, or its opposite, can, in this designed<br>
post-human creature I presume you're talking about,<br>
be disassociated from the performance of these other<br>
tasks.<br>
<p>
&lt; These considerations suggest to me that while more<br>
intellectual curiosity, and its objective correlates<br>
(such as diversity, information, novelty etc.) might<br>
be very excellent things for people like us in a<br>
world like the one we are living in today, it might<br>
nevertheless  be overly anthropocentric to assume<br>
that these things will also play a central role for a<br>
superintelligence or a society of uploaded humans. &gt;<br>
<p>
Unless you’re implying unlimited resources, the<br>
ability to clone oneself to endless tasks (AND<br>
somehow maintain a thread of cohesive experience), OR<br>
a society of predominantly mono-functional agents,<br>
why would the economics of incentives would be<br>
radically different?<br>
