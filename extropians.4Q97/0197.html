<i>&gt;         &gt;True and false are objective reality, and neither we nor *any*</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;volitional agent get to dictate them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If so then I see no reason to obey its principles, even if I knew them. I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; make objective reality a deal, I won't bother it if it won't bother me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;For all we know, the objective fact is that 11 million people</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			&gt;died in a "Holocaust"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is only one way anybody could convince me that such a horrible thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; occurred, send in their Nanomachines and massively rewire my brain,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and even then "I" wouldn't be convinced because the resulting creature would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be so radically different that it would no longer be me. If objective reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; says mass murder is true then I say objective reality can kiss my ass</i><br>
<i>&gt; because subjective reality is better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;What we are evolved to regard as "true" is as irrelevant as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;numbers we evolved to see as "real".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Irrelevant to who?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;True and false are objective facts, and not facts which we or *any*</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;volitional agent were consulted about. [...] Real true and false</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;are outside of our opinions and unaffected by them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If there is an objective reality then I agree that our opinions do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect it, and I would go further and say that objective reality does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect our opinions. If we do not effect it and it does not effect us then</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ockham's Razor says that the Objective Reality Theory is not needed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Einstein did not prove that the luminiferous ether was nonexistent, he only</i><br>
<i>&gt; proved that the idea was silly, but that was enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You and I can no more affect true and false that way than we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;flatten the Earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then "reality" doesn't need your help so don't worry about it, let it keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing whatever in the world it's doing, and if anybody asks your opinion about</i><br>
<i>&gt; a second genocide being "true" keep advising them that it's a very bad idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;With respect to reality, you can't prevail over some higher authority</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So all objective reality means is that if somebody more powerful than yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; tells you something is true then you'd better believe it? In some cases that</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be good advice but seems a bit anticlimactic for such a grand concept.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You can either be false, or true. Opinions are either wrong or</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;right.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't like sweet potatoes. Am I true or false?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;It's as if a debate over the shape of the Earth was being conducted,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;where one side wanted to know what the shape "really" was and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;other fought valiantly for freedom of opinion and decried any side</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that tyranically declared a single truth, or even that a single</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;truth existed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, it's not like the shape of the Earth, it's as if the debate was over</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether the Three Stooges were funny. Suppose you watch a film of the stooges</i><br>
<i>&gt; and laugh, but then somebody says "Yudkowsky you have made an error, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; joke was not funny. I have found that Objective Humor exists and with my</i><br>
<i>&gt; comic algorithm I can calculate the humor content of any message string to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 16 decimal places and do it in polynomial time. The calculation proves</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusively that the joke was not even slightly funny, it produced a zero."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And yet you still laughed. "Objective Humor" didn't think it was funny, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eliezer S. Yudkowsky did.</i><br>
<p>
Guess I was wrong, then.  Obviously "Objective Humor" isn't being defined as<br>
what causes the neural events that I experience as laughter, but in some<br>
different way.  Maybe there is such a thing as "Objective Humor"... although I<br>
can't really speculate without fully knowing what it is that *we* experience<br>
as funny.  Maybe our own brains use a "comic algorithm" with an extremely<br>
elegant and objective core, but various neural malfunctions keep throwing us off.<br>
<p>
Maybe everyone uses the same core criterion for "laughter", so that a joke<br>
could be invented which was funny to everyone.  Then if somebody who suffered<br>
a massive stroke didn't laugh at that or any other joke, we would say that the<br>
joke really was funny and the person was wrong - his laughter neurons<br>
malfunctioned.  Or if someone suffered a stroke and started laughing all the<br>
time, or started laughing whenever he saw the color purple, we would have no<br>
bones about saying that purple wasn't "really" funny and the behavior was the<br>
result of brain damage.<br>
<p>
You can object to this on ideological grounds, but in point of fact this *is*<br>
what a normal, sane, non-philosophical human would think about the above situation.<br>
