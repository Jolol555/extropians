I hear from people who want to do business with mocrosoft, develop apps<br>
for windows, etc. but are too cheap to get the full microsoft training<br>
in developing apps for windows (so what if they charge a lot, its their<br>
proprietary info, and they can charge whatever they want). Yet they have<br>
the gall to complain that there are "undocumented" features that they<br>
didn't know about. DUH. SOunds like a candidate for welfare...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But maybe these people are all incredebly naive and don't understand IT at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all ;-). Sort of like us poor IBM-ers. Why is it that every time M$ outfits</i><br>
<i>&gt; a company with NT they come to IBM (or another IT consultant company) for</i><br>
<i>&gt; help with their suddenly HUGE security and systems-management problems? Why</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it that it takes three times as long to get Systems Management software</i><br>
<i>&gt; working in an NT Client-Server (if_you_insist_on_calling_it_that)</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment?.</i><br>
<p>
maybe because IBM's systems management software was optimized for OS/2,<br>
that hugely successful operating system that spelled IBM's demise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't the fact that there are lot's of anti-MS sites around saying something?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've never come accross an anti-IBM site (Or HP, Apple, SGI, SUN, Corel....).</i><br>
<i>&gt; But if anyone can locate one I'll be most interested in it's content.</i><br>
<p>
Its really not polite to kick someone when they are down....<br>
