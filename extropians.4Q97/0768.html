: The federal government is the landlord of the<br>
: property known as the United States. The rules<br>
: of the landlord  must be followed or penalty<br>
: is effected.  It is not coercion so long as<br>
: you are free to leave the U.S. property if<br>
: you have a problem with the contract.<br>
:<br>
: As we can see, the U.S. property arrangement<br>
: is not different than the "private property,"<br>
: for we are free to leave the U.S., therefore<br>
: the application of U.S. law is not coercion.<br>
:<br>
: You do not have to sign the contact to be<br>
: compelled to abide by it. When I walk into<br>
: a store, I still have to abide by their rules<br>
: even if I did not sign a contact. Entry =&gt;<br>
: agreement with the terms of the property.<br>
: Thus to enter a preexisting claim is to<br>
: agree to the rules therein, or not, in<br>
: which case the landlord can use force<br>
: according to libertarian moral theory.<br>
<p>
You've forgotten one thing.  The Washington regime did not get here<br>
first.  It was created, by people and states with pre-existing land<br>
claims, and exists by virtue of a contract -- which it has broken.<br>
If the government doesn't like the contract which allows it to exist,<br>
rather than amending it by unilateral fiat (i.e. appointing judges to<br>
interpret that the contract couldn't possibly mean what it says), it<br>
should leave our land.<br>
<p>
A better analogy is between the government and a carpenter<br>
hired to repair a stairway, who once inside the house pulls a gun<br>
and says "This house is mine now, and if you don't like it you<br>
can leave."<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: What makes the market work is the ease with<br>
: which customers can exit a given establishment.<br>
: What makes government not work is the difficulty<br>
: with which customers can exit the country.  [...]<br>
<p>
Agreed.  As Coase said, low transaction costs can make<br>
the initial assignment of rights irrelevant.<br>

Kristen Brennan (codewarrior princess) writes<br>
: I believe US Court precident is that if party A has<br>
: enjoyed the benefits of a contract for several years<br>
: without contesting it, then party B may hold them to<br>
: the contract's constraints, even if they haven't signed it.<br>
:<br>
: I'm not sure how I feel about this, but couldn't the US<br>
: make the case that American Libertarians have used government-built<br>
: highways, and enjoyed the protection of fire dept., police, etc.,<br>
: even if they haven't taken advantage of them?<br>
<p>
But where's the contract that purports to supersede<br>
the Constitution as ratified?  What are its provisions?<br>
Who are its parties?<br>
