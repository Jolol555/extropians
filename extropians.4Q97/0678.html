<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Date: Fri, 10 Oct 1997 21:41:18 -0700 (PDT)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  From: "Bryan O'Sullivan" &lt;bos@serpentine.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Subject: Risks of installing Internet Explorer 4.0</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I just downloaded and installed Microsoft Internet Exploder 4.0 onto my PC</i><br>
<i>&gt; running Windows 95 at home.  Among the optional features that come with</i><br>
<i>&gt; this release are a few tidbits that were included with Plus!, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly-useless set of bells and whistles that was packaged separately from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows 95.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Two of these features are opaque window manipulation (when you move or</i><br>
<i>&gt; resize a window, the entire window moves in real time, rather than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rubberband representation being tweaked) and anti-aliasing of large fonts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The anti-aliasing feature is quite useful; it makes fonts in large point</i><br>
<i>&gt; sizes noticeably less pixelated.  However, in this feature lies a small,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and somewhat malicious, piece of code.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   This snippet of code apparently checks to see whether it is being asked</i><br>
<i>&gt; to render a font by the Netscape Navigator browser (or, indeed, any</i><br>
<i>&gt; component of the Communicator 4.x suite).  If it is, it gives back a plain</i><br>
<i>&gt; old jagged-edged font; otherwise, in every instance I have been able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; check, it gives back an anti-aliased font.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   This appears to be a clear instance of discriminatory coding on the part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Microsoft, and is intended, one presumes, to make Navigator look</i><br>
<i>&gt; somewhat cruddy in comparison with MSIE (not to mention all of the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; software on a system).  It begs a troubling question: what other features</i><br>
<i>&gt; were included in MSIE 4.0 that were intended to, in some sense, impede the</i><br>
<i>&gt; software of Microsoft's competitors?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ------- End of Forwarded Message</i><br>
<p>
I would suggest that it is possible that either a) Netscape didn't have<br>
its anti-aliasing sh** together when Microsoft needed it to be to make<br>
it into this version, or b) bratty little Andreeson won't play at all.<br>
Considering that Word x.x can't import concurrent WordPerfect files, and<br>
vice versa, only older verions files, this shouldn't be too much of a<br>
surprise that the current browser releases aren't totally transferable.<br>
Considering how whiney Andreeson has been in using the Justice<br>
Retardment to enforce his mercantilist leanings in the face of a lack of<br>
competetiveness technologically, I would give equal weight to<br>
possibility B.<br>
