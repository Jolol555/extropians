Micro review: WOW!!!<br>
<p>
Mini Review: This novel has everything: divergent human species,<br>
uploads, nanotechnology, gamma ray bursters, traversable wormholes,<br>
picotechnology, multidimensional physics and the most bizarre<br>
aliens I have ever read about. <br>
<p>
Diaspora is a posthuman novel from the beginning. Only one of the<br>
main characters have ever had a biological body, and the entire <br>
first chapter contains the description of how small infomorphs are <br>
made (the storks have been replaced by genetic algorithms, simulated<br>
gradients of morphogens, neural networks and hebbian learning).<br>
Most of the events occurs inside the virtual worlds running in the<br>
"polis", dense nanocomputer networks where the infomorphs ("citizens")<br>
live, although these realities are often seamless blends between<br>
physical and virtual reality (one of the main questions is whether<br>
the physical world does matter or not - some citizens prefer to<br>
withdraw from reality altogether, while others crusade for "realism").<br>
<p>
Of course, Egan could not make the characters too alien, since <br>
one of the principal requirements of a working novel is that the<br>
reader is able to identify with the characters. So despite the<br>
fact that they rewrite parts of their minds, copy, merge, download<br>
into physical bodies or branch out in mutated copies they are<br>
pretty human in many ways. Egan consistently uses gender neutral<br>
pronoun for the infomorphs ("ve" instead of "he/she", "ver"<br>
instead of "his/her" and so on), although some of the characters<br>
still gave me a male of female impression.<br>
<p>
What really makes Diaspora into a great novel is the magnificient<br>
imagination and scientific know-how. This is hard science fiction<br>
as it is meant to be: no rayguns or warp drives, but ten-dimensional<br>
grand unified theories, the rotational dynamics of binary<br>
neutron stars and high level particle physics instead. I must admit<br>
that I wonder how much this book does require of the reader,<br>
I found myself reviewing my notes from my old course in topology<br>
at one point and sketching diagrams of fibre bundles. Hopefully<br>
the ordinary reader can simply accept the concepts as technobabble,<br>
technobabble which turns out to be well researched and consistent.<br>
Regardless of its level, it is clear that Egan has one of the most<br>
fertile imaginations around, rivalled only by Iain Banks and<br>
David Zindell. Unlike them, he really manages to show how the<br>
miracles are done, often in surpising detail. <br>
<p>
As a while Diaspora is a grandiose zoom outwards, from the bits<br>
in a nanocomputer hidden under the siberian tundra to ever more<br>
cosmic scales. When the reader has got used to one miracle Egan<br>
zooms out again, and the previously titanic suddenly looks rather<br>
commonplace. The tension lies not as much in the plot as in the<br>
question: how will Egan outdo *this*? And Egan does really<br>
succeed. The final monument to the creativity of intelligent<br>
life and the infinite possibilities of physics is truly<br>
impressive, and points towards even more grandiose possibilities.<br>
