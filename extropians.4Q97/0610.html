hi everyone,<br>
<p>
good to see the list is working again, heres a post i sent that got bounced<br>
back<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in discussions<br>
<i> &gt; of the "singularity".  While a simple interpolation and future</i><br>
<i> &gt; projection of (for example) available computing power may show a</i><br>
<i> &gt; vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of</i><br>
<i> &gt; computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a</i><br>
<i> &gt; flattening of the curve.</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
But then again, maybe that may show exponential growth as well (the<br>
underlying equations), which would<br>
add an exponential curve on top of the exponential curve already in place,<br>
making faster computing power more advanced in a much shorter time than we<br>
expected!  Like with using alternative computing resources such as using<br>
brain cells to hold storage (hold storage or compute? i think both), actually<br>
evolving our<br>
computers into the bio-spectrum.<br>

<i>&gt;unknowable future beings is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;a good way of doing projections (except by me, since I'm guided by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Omega Point reaching back in time. See what I mean?)</i><br>
<p>
Im with you, but unknowable future beings are whats going to create our<br>
future, so we are really limited if we dont make some predictions, or<br>
extrapolations.  I think you would be interested in Terrence McKenna's<br>
Timewave Theory, where he has a map of time and explains that all of history<br>
is an ingression of exponential novelty towards a point, and that point has<br>
repercussions back in time.  His proposed end date: dec 21, 2012.  That is<br>
the same end date as the Mayan calendar, and he says that he came to the end<br>
date without the knowledge of the mayan end date, that must have been a shock<br>
for hime to discover that Mayan information.  The Mayans were great<br>
astromer/astrologers, who knew that the earth was round long before anyone<br>
else did, and lots of other stuff. Check out TM's homepage on the web:<br>
deoxy.org/mckenna.htm<br>
<p>
Here's one of my favorite things he proposes:<br>
<p>
All of matter is composed of one electron moving back and forth in time from<br>
the beginning of time (big bang) to the end of time (2012 zero date). but im<br>
not sure how he takes into account the positrons, perhaps they are the<br>
electrons moving back in time, or rather THE electron. I wonder what<br>
determines where in the universe the electron manifests itself after each<br>
round it makes.  Any thoughts? Also, are electrons the same as the subatomic<br>
elements of neutrons and protons? If not, what are the similarities and<br>
differences?  <br>
<p>
thanks<br>
