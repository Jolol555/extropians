<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the improvements in health.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many have said exercise is good </i><br>
<i>&gt;but never has it been explained to me in a convincing manner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;1-What are the health benifits besides strong hearts, lungs, and ankles</i><br>
<i>&gt;(weak ankles cause many falls which lead to complications due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;osteoporosis)?</i><br>
<p>
Enhance immunity, enhanced intelligence and mental energy, increased GH, etc<br>
(just about every life enhancing factor you can think of - except production<br>
of free radicals and some waste products, both of which are not a problem,<br>
ie more than made up for by compensating enhancements, if the exercise is<br>
not too extreme)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years</i><br>
<i>&gt; after massive intestinal failure.</i><br>
<p>
2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?<br>
<p>
Medically, "Nutritional deficiency" has a very technical meaning. For each<br>
nutrient which is deemed essential, there is a specific deficency disease<br>
which happens when all others are adequate and only it is deficient.<br>
It is necessary that there be such a disease in order for a nutrient to be<br>
called essential. The RDA is the amount which is necessary to prevent this<br>
disease in most people.<br>
<p>
Thus, it is likely that no one on parenteral feeding "technically" dies of <br>
nutrient deficiency since the diet ensures that they get all of the known<br>
essential nutrients. The problem is that first there are likely still some<br>
unknown important nutrients and the term essential as defined above is not<br>
necessarily sufficient to keep one alive for very long.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;While I'm speaking of them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;3-Have any tests been done to estimate the average length of life </i><br>
<i>&gt;after specific nutrients are removed from the diet?</i><br>
<p>
For the technically essential nutrients, yes, these things are generally<br>
known.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wonder how long it takes to die from each nutrient deficiency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4-What phrases could I use for a medline search?</i><br>
<p>
You might be better to begin with an advanced nutrition text such as<br>
<p>
_Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism_ Groff, Gropper and Hunt<br>
Krause's _Food, Diet, and Nutrition Therapy_<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; leading to a similar oxygen saturation?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Possibly, but there is generally less O at higher altitudes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I imagine the red cell count balances the lack of O.</i><br>
<p>
I spoke to this on my other post.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the capillaries.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but you need to learn more physiology. The red blood cells have<br>
nothing to do with nutrient distribution. In fact, more red blood cells<br>
might tend to make it worse, there is only so much blood volume available.<br>
See Guyton's _A Textbook of Medical Physiology_ (a good book on the body<br>
changes due to exercise also)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream</i><br>
<i>&gt;(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are also increases in efficiency of temperature distribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;preventing hyper/hypothermia, thus leading to decreased free-radical</i><br>
<i>&gt;production from sweating/shivering.</i><br>
<p>
Again you need to learn more physiology. The body is not warmed and cooled<br>
as if some central heating system with the blood vessels taking the place<br>
of water or air condiuts. The temperature regulation is done directly by<br>
each cell in response to thyroid hormones and others information transmitters<br>
all the blood does is even out the temperature from one spot to the other.<br>
So you are correct that more blood volume could aid in preventing "hot spots"<br>
where additional free radical damage might be increased by the higher<br>
temperature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) </i><br>
<p>
some do some don't<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;at high altitudes when they have a lack of white cells to fight them?</i><br>
<p>
Why should people at high altitudes lack white blood cells?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate </i><br>
<i>&gt;if I increase my red cells and my O saturation.</i><br>
<p>
My morning pulse is 44. My hematocrit (% of red blood cells) is not that<br>
high though). I have heard of young med students as low as 30. Using a pulse<br>
oximeter which measures % of hemoglobin saturation, I can hold my breath<br>
without blacking out until my "SAT" goes down to about 85% (normally 98% for<br>
every healthy person). No one else I know can go below 90%.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;7-Any predictions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;8-Hmm...any risk?</i><br>
<p>
I can't tell you what the risk is until you tell me how you plan to accomplish<br>
this. Off hand other than be a tranfusion of red cells (dangerous to play with)<br>
I can't think of any way to do it (many taking testosterone injections - also<br>
dangerous to play with).<br>
