[In reply to my comment about noun/verb being an artificial distinction,<br>
Wesley Schwein replied:]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Adjectives are not universal, but nouns and verbs are not an artifical</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinction or categorization made by people with nothing better to do;</i><br>
<i>&gt; they refer to real units of organization in _all_ human languages. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not just convenience that allows linguists to say a string of phonemes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a given language is a noun or verb; verbs and nouns relate to each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; and to other parts of utterances in specific ways.</i><br>
<p>
I understand that you maintain this claim after briefly examining<br>
Lojban, so perhaps my original claim was not clear enough.  In Lojban,<br>
there are no content-words that are /inherently/ nouns or verbs.  There<br>
are certainly /roles/ analagous to verb and noun: the predicate,<br>
which expresses some relationship among one or more things, and<br>
arguments to the predicate, which are the things which stand in that<br>
relationship.  Those arguments can be thought of playing the noun<br>
role, and the predicate the verb role, but there are some distinctions<br>
that are not merely cosmetic: first, any content-word in Lojban can<br>
serve either role (and other roles), and there is are prototypical<br>
noun-verb as actor-action assumptions built in to the grammar of the<br>
language as there are with all natural languages. <br>
<p>
If I point to a dog in English and wish to express to you that this<br>
particular existent stands in the relationship "dog" (to itself,<br>
there being no other arguments to this particular predication), I<br>
have to squeeze that predicate into actor-action form by making a<br>
"verb" called "be", and having the thing take that pseudo-action<br>
upon the "recipient" of the action, "dog": "This is a dog".  In<br>
Lojban, the predicate-word "dog" asserts that its argument stands<br>
in that relationship, period.  "ti gerku".  Whether one wishes to<br>
interpret that as "this is-a-dog", or "this is dogging", or "this<br>
is doggish", is a matter of taste; if you wish to actually assert<br>
action, identification, or property, you must explicity use<br>
predicate words for action, identification, or property; the<br>
language itself makes no such assumptions.  Similarly for the<br>
content-word for "blue"; it makes no specific assumption whether<br>
the thing you say holds that predicate is actively bluing, or<br>
has the property of blueness (unless you choose to specify /that/<br>
predicate as well).<br>
<p>
Words for predicates like "go", "blue", "chair", "longer", etc.,<br>
are all identical in form as far as the language is concerned;<br>
of course some uses of them are semantically incomprehensible,<br>
but structurally they are all interchangeable:<br>
<p>
  le blanu ca klama<br>
     "The blue thing goes"<br>
  le klama ca blanu<br>
     "The goer is blue"<br>
  le clanymau pu klama le stizu<br>
     "The longer-thing went to the chair"<br>
  le stizu cu clanymau le klama be le blanu <br>
     "The chair is longer than the [goer to the blue destination]<br>
  mi klama le zarci sei stizu<br>
     "I go to the store in a chair-like way"<br>
  ti ckaji le ka blanu<br>
     "This thing inherently has the property of blueness"<br>
  ti zukte le gerku<br>
     "This is a volitional being actively dogging (i.e. being a dog)"<br>
<p>
The English glosses here are just convenient translations, not<br>
necessarily exact equivalents (in fact, the exact equivalents of<br>
each would take a page or two oto specify all the language's<br>
defaults and quantifications and such).  Certainly the concepts of<br>
actor/action are meaningful concepts; no one argues that.  But<br>
those concepts are simply not central to Lojban in the way they<br>
are to natural languages.  I likewise stand by my claim: Lojban<br>
does not have nouns and verbs /in the way that natural languages<br>
have them/.<br>
