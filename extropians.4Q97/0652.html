At 09:32 PM 10/20/97 -0700, Jeff Taylor jabbed playfully:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd have to say that your assumptions about this technology are as</i><br>
<i>&gt;insightful as the automotive industry's opinion about combustion based</i><br>
<i>&gt;propulsion. </i><br>
<p>
Whose opinion on combustion based propulsion do you recommend in<br>
preference?  The cold fusion fairy's? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What we know about genetics could fill a thimble.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Someday, these conversations will be compared to debates about the how flat</i><br>
<i>&gt;the earth is. (-;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;ps- please don't misunderstand the tone of this message.. I intend it to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;a playful jab at generalizations and narrow definitions. {-:</i><br>
<p>
Okay, all this might be so.  But if we take it too much to heart, we are<br>
obliged to fall silent.  I remind you that this started with *your*<br>
rhetorical inquiry: `How long is the growth cycle? six months? 2 years? 5<br>
years? for a full adult body?'<br>
<p>
What is the point of raising such a topic if our knowledge fills a thimble?<br>
 If our contending comments merely debate the flatness of the earth?  <br>
<p>
You refute your own objection.<br>
<p>
