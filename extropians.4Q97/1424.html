PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 346 November 13, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben<br>
Stein<br>
<p>
RECORD HIGH LEVELS OF FUSION POWER AND ENERGY<br>
have been observed at the Joint European Torus (JET) device in<br>
England.  A peak power of 13 MW was reached and  a power<br>
output of 10 MW was sustained for at least a half second, pretty<br>
impressive achievements for a fusion experiment.  The burning of<br>
the deuterium-tritium fuel inside the chamber, and the production<br>
of alpha particles (which, if they can be contained, aid the heating),<br>
went according to schedule, bolstering expectations that the<br>
proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)<br>
would work as planned.  (Nature, 6 Nov.)<br>
<p>
CHANNELING OF PARTICLE BEAMS USING NANOTUBES<br>
may be possible.  Tests at Fermilab and elsewhere have shown that<br>
high-energy beams can be deflected by the rows of atoms in suitably<br>
bent crystals (see Update 261). Now scientists at the Erevan<br>
Physical Institute in Armenia have proposed that crystals, or<br>
"ropes," of  single-walled nanotubes (SWNT's) would be even<br>
better as efficient beam channeling materials since the carbon<br>
nanotubes' large bore (13.8 angstrom diameter) allows plenty of<br>
room for the passage of  particle beams.  (L.A. Gevorgyan et al.,<br>
10 Sept. 1997, JETP (Journal of Experimental and Theoretical<br>
Physics) Letters, a Russian journal, with English translation<br>
published by AIP.)<br>
