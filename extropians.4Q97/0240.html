On Oct. 2, 1997, I posted an item captioned, "Morality?" I<br>
received a reply from Gary Lloyd, Greg Burch and Lee Daniel<br>
Crocker. There is also a reply to Mr. Crocker's response by<br>
Frederick Mann. I thank one and all for their interest, comments<br>
and questions. I responded to Mr. Lloyd's reply and I have since<br>
received another. Mr. Burch has also added considerably to his<br>
contribution. All in all, the volume is rapidly increasing and<br>
getting beyond quick handling. In light of the current<br>
circumstance I have concluded that a singular composite response<br>
focusing upon the central points and questions of the issue will<br>
avoid unnecessary repetition and aid in communication. Of course,<br>
if there is any specific question or point that anyone wishes me<br>
to address, just say the word and it shall be done. <br>
<p>
What is clear to me is that I have failed to communicate my<br>
conclusions and position on the concept, morality. Rather than<br>
discuss and speculate about cause, I shall endeavor to remedy by<br>
sharper focus on a few points.<br>
<p>
As I see it, the issue and focal point is this: I see the<br>
concept, morality, as definitively and inherently attached to the<br>
illusory, but much believed concept, superior being; a concept of<br>
many variations often far removed from formal religion. <br>
Consequently, the derivative concepts, inferior being,<br>
subordination and rule are anti individual and inevitably<br>
culminate in hostility and violent conflict.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Burch, and no doubt many<br>
others, see the concept, morality, as adaptable to the concept,<br>
individualism, with resultant peaceful non coercion that the term<br>
individualism implies. Thus, are we consciously in accord as to<br>
end desired, but divided on the question of means. This is the<br>
chasm I shall try to bridge.<br>
<p>
Mr. Lloyd states:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Morality is rooted in the objectively observable phenomenon of</i><br>
<i>&gt;aggression/defense. It comes from the fact that humans, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;volitional creatures, must necessarily choose to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves against aggression, and decide that it is "right" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do so. The far less desirable alternative survival strategy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;to subjugate themselves to aggressors, thus losing volition.</i><br>
<p>
The statement assumes that an individual MUST choose a particular<br>
end: the end, survival. This contradicts the natural element of<br>
choice. <br>
<p>
In response to another post, Mr. Crocker addresses this current <br>
situation as well:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That conclusion requires a premise you failed to state:</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you desire to stay alive.  Those same descriptive</i><br>
<i>&gt;premises, combined with the normative premise of wanting</i><br>
<i>&gt;to die, would rationally lead you to conclude that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;/should/ piss off a cop.  Without sneaking in the normative</i><br>
<i>&gt;premise, there's no way to reach a normative conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
As Mr. Crocker implies, the choice to live does not constitute a<br>
"natural standard" . When one incorporates in his thinking the<br>
fact that the choice to live is a subjective choice not an<br>
objective mandate, one arrives at far different conclusions about<br>
a lot of things. The idea of "life" as a "natural standard" may<br>
seem innocent enough because most consciously choose to live, but<br>
the premise denies the reality of individual choice and opens the<br>
door to the limitless choosing of values for another or others.<br>
If there is an "objective standard" of "life", it follows that<br>
each and every value making up a philosophical life is likewise a<br>
matter of "objective value" - or "ought to be." The concept,<br>
morality, itself presumes to set an alleged natural standard, and<br>
thus presumes to displace individual preference. This is the root<br>
premise of subordination and rule. If peace and harmony is the<br>
goal sought, this belief system is bad news. <br>
<p>
The general history of mankind, up to and including present day,<br>
has be and is one of dissention, hostility, and violent conflict. <br>
Behind this effect are the actions that cause. Behind the actions<br>
lie the beliefs that direct. These beliefs are for the most part<br>
propagated and promoted by the use of language. If the beliefs<br>
that underlie these hostile action are true, I see no possible<br>
remedy. If these beliefs are false, i.e., do not conform to<br>
objective reality, it follows that the language usage that<br>
promotes and sustains these beliefs likewise does not conform to<br>
objective reality. When one matches words to the real, a picture<br>
emerges that is far different from the one painted by language<br>
distortion. <br>
<p>
At the forefront of it all is the term, truth. We all claim to<br>
search for truth and quite often claim to find it. Suppose,<br>
however, there is some disagreement as to what is or is not<br>
truth. Would we not need to know what truth is in itself that we<br>
have a reference by which to decide? Absent such a common frame<br>
of reference, what can the possible outcome be but confusion and<br>
conflict?<br>
<p>
Mr. Burch writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Moral "truth" is not of the same character as metaphysical or</i><br>
<i>&gt;logical truth.  One might say that there are metaphysical or</i><br>
<i>&gt;logical Truths, but only moral truths, because morality</i><br>
<i>&gt;can not be reduced "below" the level of social systems; it is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;emergent phenomena of the complex adaptive system that is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;life in society of volitional beings.  However, viewed from</i><br>
<i>&gt;within the framework of such systems, they ARE truths.  Viewed</i><br>
<i>&gt;from outside such framework, they mean nothing.</i><br>
<p>
Isn't  truth quite simply an idea or belief that conforms to<br>
objective reality?  The recourse to alleged "dual definitions" is<br>
an indirect admission that "moral truth" (often referred to as<br>
"spiritual truth") is in conflict with "metaphysical or logical<br>
truth." In other words, fallacy.  At this juncture, I will not<br>
pursue further, but suffice it to say until I see a second<br>
objective reality, which is necessary to give the "second truth"<br>
definitive meaning, I reject without equivocation the idea and<br>
all that is attached to it.<br>
<p>
Getting to the mission at hand, the "problem words" currently in<br>
focus are: good, bad, (evil) moral,(good) immoral (evil). A<br>
saturate teaching that one is subjected to from infancy on is the<br>
idea of "the forces of good and evil."  This teaching sets "good<br>
and evil" as objective and constant universal elements. This idea<br>
is not only promoted in formal religion citing an omni god as the<br>
"ultimate good", the idea is promoted to saturation by "community<br>
values", "national interest", "values of society" and a host of<br>
other "divine abstracts" reinforcing the emotional impression of<br>
values existing independently of individual; values that express<br>
or imply a superior being; values that individuals are programmed<br>
to believe they "ought" to hold. As false as this whole scenario<br>
is, it is usually a lock that binds the mind to "duty."<br>
<p>
Mr. Burch writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So far, you seem to say that there is no OUGHT, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply IS.  In this view, the ultimate possibility of moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice completely evaporates: No set of values is better than</i><br>
<i>&gt;another.</i><br>
<p>
Yes indeed, I do say there is no objective ought. Even on the<br>
face of it, the idea of an objective ought is an obvious<br>
contradiction. The word itself is opposed to IS as "ought" is<br>
necessarily referenced to what is not.  Among other flaws, it<br>
implies objective reality is alterable by subjective choice as<br>
well as setting an obligation existing independently of<br>
individual volition. In short, there is no "ought form is." <br>
There are often word games pretending otherwise, but none survive<br>
"the ordeal of definition."<br>
<p>
As for: &gt;In this view, the ultimate possibility of moral choice<br>
completely evaporates:&lt; - Because it never was. Choice, yes.<br>
"Moral choice", myth.<br>
<p>
Mr. Burch's comment above assumes without question that values<br>
are subject to determination as right or wrong. With all due<br>
respect, I must question, that is, disagree.  The belief that a<br>
value or values are subject to determination as right or wrong<br>
comes from the idea of selecting the "proper and superior values"<br>
inherent in the "superior beings."  In the real world of<br>
individual and subjective value, the term value always asks the<br>
question: value to whom for what purpose. Value is not something<br>
existing independently of individual and inherent in a thing or<br>
circumstance. To speak definitively of value is to say that<br>
someone ATTRIBUTES value to a thing or circumstance, a set of<br>
conditions as it were. If an individual attributes value to a<br>
particular goal, desires a particular set of circumstances, how<br>
can this valuation be subjected to the determination as right or<br>
wrong? Can it be evaluated as means to itself? I cannot accept<br>
the question as it stands because there is no definitive judgment<br>
of one set of values being better than another because the<br>
natural characteristic of attributing value is not subject to<br>
validating or invalidating as right are wrong. This function<br>
applies to means, not ends.<br>
<p>
So, how is it that the illusory idea of "good or bad" values gets<br>
to be a major part of the philosophical and social scene?<br>
Perhaps, exploring "good and bad" will help answer the question.<br>
<p>
Mr. Burch also writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems you are saying that "good" and "bad" are simply "what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;like" and "what I don't like".</i><br>
<p>
That's exactly right; and I'm not talking just about me, but you<br>
and everyone else as well. The terms, good and bad, are merely<br>
expressive synonyms for *suited to personal purpose* and<br>
*unsuited to personal purpose* respectively.  Let's see what<br>
happens when we set aside popular notions and feelings and attach<br>
the terms, good and bad, to human individual, the actual<br>
objective reference. Human individual is the real is it not? If<br>
so, then what else can stand as definitive reference to find the<br>
actual meaning of symbols, good and bad?<br>
<p>
Suppose there is a small wood fire going. Suppose you value<br>
eating cooked food and are cooking your supper over this fire.<br>
Suppose an individual comes along and dumps a big bucket of water<br>
on the fire. It goes out. Do you say, good, or do you say bad? <br>
Since dumping the water and putting out the fire negates the<br>
means to fulfill your purpose of cooking supper, you would call<br>
the action bad, would you not?<br>
<p>
Suppose there is a small wood fire going. The fire is close to<br>
your house. The wind changes and the fire is about to ignite your<br>
valued house and burn it down. Suppose an individual comes along<br>
and dumps a big bucket of water on the fire and it goes out. Do<br>
you say good, or do you say bad? Since dumping the water and<br>
putting out the fire fulfilled your purpose of saving your valued<br>
house, you would call the action good, would you not?<br>
<p>
Same entities. Same actions. Same end result. - But a different<br>
call as to whether good or bad, right? So what made the different<br>
call? Your varied purpose, right?  Your value judgment of end<br>
desired by which to evaluate the means as suited or unsuited to<br>
current purpose, right? Isn't this always true whether were<br>
talking about your varied end desires or the end desires of other<br>
individuals? <br>
<p>
The foregoing utilizes real individual as reference and <br>
illustrates the DEFINITIVE (conforming to reality) application of<br>
the terms, good and bad. How does one arrive at a constant<br>
"objective morality" while incorporating the fact that the<br>
definitive designation of good or bad is infinitely variable in<br>
step with subjective individual purpose? <br>
<p>
All speak of the "moral good" etc. as "objective" and fixed. This<br>
requires a constant and universal purpose. Thus one is obliged to<br>
abandon individual as reference and rely on "God's will", or<br>
other alleged source of a singular universal objective value.<br>
Since morality is myth and exists only as a feeling, it is not<br>
uncommon for conscious mind to reject the idea of a universal<br>
superior being as source. Nevertheless, when we eliminate human<br>
individual as reference for the concept, morality, what remains<br>
except an expressed or implied superior being; indeed, what<br>
psychological force does the concept, morality, have without<br>
subordinating individual to an "external superior?"<br>
<p>
Most believe (feel) that if one is not guided by a "moral code",<br>
he is "evil incarnate" and given to all sorts of murder and<br>
mayhem. As usual, this belief is exactly backward.  I am an<br>
advocate and practitioner of individualism. My operational<br>
premise is self ownership. This premise rejects initiation of<br>
force and coercion in any and all forms, including governmental<br>
systems. I hold this philosophy solely because I believe it is in<br>
my best interest. I need no, and seek no other validation. <br>
<p>
If another individual values something I have and chooses to try<br>
to gain it by theft, there is nothing to prevent me from<br>
resisting for no other reason than his actions are not suited to<br>
my purpose of keeping that which he covets. I do not call his<br>
valuation or action "immoral" for the word is meaningless except<br>
to imply a universal code of values that said individual and all<br>
others "ought" to hold and practice. Nor do I   defer to any<br>
imaginary superior being seeking sanction of "moral right" to<br>
"justify" my defensive actions. Such thinking is admitted<br>
subservience to a "higher authority". If one looks to "higher<br>
authority" for the "moral right" to defend, cannot one just as<br>
easily look to "higher authority" for the "moral right" to<br>
command? This is the danger and destruction of the concept,<br>
morality, and illusory objective value. Do I not describe the<br>
"justification" for the horrors of  history and present<br>
circumstance?<br>
<p>
I am acutely aware of the nearly infinite psychological<br>
resistance to the ideas expressed and implied herein. The<br>
resistance is evidenced in the centuries of unquestioning<br>
devotion and dedication to the concepts, god, government and<br>
morality that have consistently failed to bring about  peace and<br>
harmony. Indeed, a few simple definitions easily predict this<br>
perpetual failure. Millions talking about government as if the<br>
term symbolizes a volitional acting entity does not erase the<br>
factual definition that government IS the initiation of force and<br>
coercion. Neither faith nor language distortion for sake of self<br>
delusion and  preferred self image will ever change this fact;<br>
nor will all the believers in the world manage to change natural<br>
law and cause an end result contrary to the means employed. <br>
<p>
As always, show me a flaw in my thinking and I will be grateful.<br>
However, unsupported declaration of error will not suffice. <br>
