Having an interest in living a long, long time, and not being sure I can make it<br>
from here to when the fountain of youth is invented and marketed, I have an<br>
interest in cryonics.  I've only read a little bit up on it, so I'm no<br>
expert, but with<br>
that preface, it seems the main technological problem which we might tackle<br>
is that of finding a superb cryoprotectant.<br>
<p>
To this end, I typed in the following schema, in hopes that someone will<br>
either tell me:<br>
<p>
        a) it's already being done,<br>
        b) it won't work, or<br>
        c) it's a brilliant idea and let's get started.<br>
<p>
Here is the schema:<br>
<p>
        Engineering cryoprotectants:<br>
The basic idea is to 	come up with specificaions for the ideal cryoprotectant<br>
in detail.  And I mean, ultimately, in technical detail.  This will probably<br>
involve<br>
finding some rigorous tests, such as how well it allows cells to not suffer<br>
damage, though I would advise other tests as well.  Perhaps some sort of<br>
microstructure could be used as a test bed.<br>
<p>
Next, find existing chemicals that meet one or more of the specs.  There are<br>
already a few good cryoprotectants in use, but I mean any chemical<br>
whatsoever.  This is almost a form of brainstorming.  The idea is to widen<br>
the scope of the search in hopes of a serendipitous solution.<br>
<p>
We can also use genetic algorithmns and the like to come up with a<br>
molecular design and try to create a compound or set of compounds<br>
from the results.  This is sort of like crossing a butterfly with a bee to<br>
come up with a graceful stinging bug.  Many of the crossbreeds will<br>
be unviable monsters, but one might work.<br>
<p>
After this, the cryoprotectant can be tested on nerve cells and perhaps<br>
networks of nerves.  (Has such already been done?  I am talking about<br>
examining the connections between cells -- which most assume are<br>
responsible for how the brain behaves, including the mind -- for<br>
damage.)  Finally, the cryoprotectant will be tested on whole systems,<br>
such as a whole mouse that is alive.<br>
<p>
Can anyone enlighten me here?<br>
<p>
