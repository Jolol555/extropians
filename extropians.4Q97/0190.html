Herb Simon and Allen Newell presented one of the most interesting early<br>
(i.e., 1958) collections of predictions about artificial intelligence.<br>
Since so many predictions are being made on this list I think it is useful<br>
and fun to look back at older predictions. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the web pages of Alan Bundy:</i><br>
<a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/staff/personal_pages/bundy/teaching/2-method/notes/ai2-meth-notes/node3.html">http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/staff/personal_pages/bundy/teaching/2-method/notes/ai2-meth-notes/node3.html</a><br>
<p>
Bundy says the following quote can be found in:<br>
Simon, H.A. and Newell, A. (1958). Heuristic problem solving: The next<br>
advance in operations research. Operations Research, 6(1). <br>
<p>
``On the basis of these developments, and the speed with which research in<br>
this field is progressing, I am willing to make the following predictions,<br>
to be realized within the next ten years: <br>
<p>
1. That within ten years a digital computer will be the world's chess<br>
champion, unless the rules bar it from competition. <br>
<p>
2. That within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an<br>
important new mathematical theorem. <br>
<p>
3. That within ten years a digital computer will write music that will be<br>
accepted by critics as possessing considerable aesthetic value. <br>
<p>
4. That within ten years most theories in psychology will take the<br>
form of computer programs, or of qualitative statements about the<br>
characteristics of computer programs.'' <br>
<p>
End quote<br>
<p>
The development mentioned in prediction one arguably happened in 1997<br>
(<a href="http://www.chess.ibm.com/">http://www.chess.ibm.com/</a>). Of course, the match was not for the world<br>
chess championship as recognized by a major chess organization, but<br>
Kasparov is widely recognized as the best human chess player.<br>
This event took 39 years after 1958 instead of ten.<br>
<p>
The closest match for prediction two I can think of extemporaneously is<br>
the proof that "Robbins Algebras Are Boolean" <br>
(<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/index.html">http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/index.html</a>).  A computer<br>
program did not "discover" this theorem, but a program called an automated<br>
deduction system was used to prove it. <br>
<p>
Here is an excerpt from the press release announcing this result:<br>
<p>
The Robbins problem, which has puzzled mathematicians and<br>
logicians for more than 60 years, has been solved by automated<br>
reasoning software developed in the Mathematics and Computer<br>
Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory.  The problem<br>
was posed by Herbert Robbins at Harvard University in the<br>
1930s, and some of the great mathematicians of the century<br>
have worked on it.<br>
<p>
End excerpt<br>
<p>
The proof of Robbins Theorem was done in 1996.  Other proofs such as the<br>
"Four Color Map Theorem"  and the "Non-existence of the Finite Projective<br>
Plane of Order 10" required the use of computers and human thought.<br>
<p>
Maybe some list member will know about a match or partial match for<br>
prediction three.<br>
<p>
Prediction four is not easy to assess because psychology is a diverse<br>
field and the prediction refers to "most theories in psychology".  Yet,<br>
computer models of human thought are certainly influential nowadays.  See,<br>
for example, Steven Pinker's recent book "How the Mind Works"  W. W.<br>
Norton and Company (1997) <br>
