The receiver has an apparatus in which a number  of entangled photons <br>
are<br>
captured.  He measures these photons one by one, noting one of four <br>
possible<br>
values for these photons: A, B, C or D (these values represent the <br>
polarization<br>
of the photon.)  He sees an apparently random assortment of values.  He<br>
knows that the teleportation is successful only 25% of the time, so he <br>
doesn't<br>
know which values are data and which are noise.<br>
<p>
The sender attempts quantum teleportation on each of the entangled <br>
photons<br>
the receiver has.  He is successful one time in four, and knows when he <br>
is<br>
successful.  He notes when he is successful and the state of the photons<br>
on these successes.  He knows that the receiver has these values for <br>
these<br>
particular photons, but the receiver has no way of knowing that these <br>
are<br>
the values that represent meaningful data.<br>
<p>
The sender can now send a slower than (or equal to)  light speed message<br>
to the receiver as to which values were successfully teleported, and <br>
which<br>
were noise.  The sender can now read his message.<br>
<p>
Note that the receiver's results will be the same whether the sender <br>
attempts<br>
teleportation or not: the receiver sees equally distributed random <br>
values,<br>
each value appearing 25% of the time.  Some of those values may be <br>
values<br>
sent by the sender using quantum teleportation, but only the sender <br>
knows.<br>
<p>
Does that help any?<br>
