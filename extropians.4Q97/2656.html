i guess my take on the gun ownership thing is this: i really dont want<br>
anyone telling me that im  A.) too suggestable to read pornography B.)<br>
unable to control my intake of non-lethal drugs, and C.) too irresponsible<br>
to own a gun.<br>
<p>
i dislike being legislatively told what i can and cant do. too often these<br>
rules are based on others' morality, statistical analysis, or fears. i am<br>
able to handle pictures of nude women, have smoked pot without succumbing to<br>
crack addiction, and know a gun in my hands wont turn me into frank nitti.<br>
why does the government, or the darker forces of liberalism feel they know<br>
better?<br>
<p>
as an extropian, i feel we all progress as humans when we have the least<br>
restrictions. i fear calls for laws about cryogenics and cloning are going<br>
to result in strictures that hurt more than help.<br>
