<p>
note: "Backing for" is not in my english dictionnary, but i suspect it's<br>
similar<br>
to "protecting rights". If I made a mistake, sorry.<br>
Most of the time, in a conflict, everybody is fighting for one's rights.<br>
Self proclaimed<br>
"Bad guys" are quite rare in history. There is always a moral justificati=<br>
on<br>
somewhere. =<br>
<p>
Now, I will not discuss to know if man is naturally a predator or not (th=<br>
is<br>
is an endless debate...). I will neither discuss to know if transhuman ha=<br>
s<br>
to be predator<br>
or not. But I think there is a logical flaw in this argument:<br>
-If you think it's "natural" (mmhh, I don't like this term) for man to be=<br>
<p>
"predator" =<br>
<p>
and "forceful" so, every strategy is good to increase your power. Includi=<br>
ng<br>
the State.<br>
If you think it's immoral to pay taxes and that the State is a thief, it<br>
only proves that<br>
you found a better predator than you. That's life! =<br>
<p>
<p>
Now, I would like to precise  my conception of "Left anarchy". It's not<br>
about theft of pigs or anything else, it's a system which can only work i=<br>
f<br>
it profits for everybody, otherwise it's not anarchy. It's an economical<br>
system where the transaction does not occur between two individuals A and=<br>
<p>
B, but between A and the whole system. A does not "sell" something to B,<br>
but simply put it in the environment (like when you<br>
release a software in "public domain"), where B can find it.<br>
 I'm not sure, but I suspect this has lot in common with the "complex<br>
bartender" proposed by Eliezer recently, although I did not understood al=<br>
l<br>
the details of his implementation. Am i wrong, Eliezer ?<br>
