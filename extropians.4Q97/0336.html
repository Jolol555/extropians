What I would call instinctive ends are reserved for unreasoning animals and<br>
infants until they reach the mental maturity to calculate in the abstract.<br>
However,  answering your question does not require this differentiation<br>
since all value is attributed by individual mind as opposed to discovered;<br>
meaning that ends (value attributed) is still ALWAYS subjective.<br>

You responded:<br>

<i>&gt;discussion.</i><br>
<p>
I see your end desire stipulated and implicitly coupled with the wish that<br>
Mr. Crocker attribute  value to the end you name.  What is missing is why he<br>
should do so other than to please you. Where is recognition of Mr. Crocker's<br>
choice in the matter? The reality is that Mr. Crocker does have a choice and<br>
to not recognize it, whether it pleases you or not, is not dealing with AS<br>
IS, but denial of AS IS, which is to say, denial of the existent, Mr.<br>
Crocker. This is literally what every claim of discovered "objective value"<br>
does. In other words, the concept, objective value, is an illusion and<br>
inherently anti individual.<br>
<p>
It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be entirely<br>
eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non scientific terms<br>
would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality of a thing or<br>
situation. Having expressed this desire, I remain aware that my end chosen<br>
is not the end desire of most. Consequently, I will continue to deal with<br>
the real by exposing the fact that ought and should have no connection to<br>
objective reality except as personal preference and subjective declarations.<br>
