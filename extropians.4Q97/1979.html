Dyson says that life processes could continue indefinitely in a open universe, <br>
but that's not good enough, I'm interested in consciousness and intelligence, <br>
I don't care if digestion continues for eternity or not. Immortality means  <br>
experiencing an infinite amount of subjective time, and that means being <br>
able to think an infinite number of thoughts and that doesn't seem like a <br>
realistic possibility in a open  universe. In an open universe everything <br>
will keep getting colder and most things will get larger and weaker too. <br>
Life will have to keep adapting to new  conditions and it won't be easy.<br>
<p>
The components of any machine, including a brain, must keep getting more  <br>
distant if it's going to work.  The reason is that a heat engine in such a <br>
universe will only be able to exploit very tiny differences in temperature  <br>
and that means it will be very inefficient. To get a usable energy output it  <br>
would need to be HUGE. With parts that far apart and the finite speed of <br>
light the brain is going to slow way down.<br>
<p>
There are more problems, all electromagnetic photons would be of VERY low  <br>
energy and so would have to have an enormous wavelength. A simple quarter <br>
wavelength antenna for a billion mile photon, or a trillion light year one, <br>
would need to be astronomical, and then some. A reflector to concentrate the<br>
photons for energy use would be MUCH larger still. Also, in order to <br>
establish reliable communication it's going to take more and more photons of <br>
light to send one bit of information. It won't be easy for one part of a <br>
brain to hit it's target a billion trillion light years away, almost zero <br>
chance if you only send one photon. Also, each photon will be strongly and<br>
increasingly redshifted, to compensate the sender must keep shorting the <br>
wavelength of the photons he uses but this takes energy and you only have a <br>
finite amount of it in a open universe.<br>
<p>
Contrast this with a closed universe. Tipler thinks that the universe will be  <br>
able to perform an infinite, and not just astronomical, number of calculations <br>
between now and the final singularity at the end of the Big Crunch. With this <br>
much computer power it would be easy to emulate every human being who ever <br>
lived and do it for an infinitely long subjective time. But isn't infinite <br>
computation a fantasy? If the universe has a finite number of particles and <br>
all of them are engaged in computation, isn't that a limit?  Perhaps not. <br>
The particles could be performing calculations at a faster and faster speed,<br>
of course you'd need an unlimited supply of energy to do that, but that's <br>
exactly what you'd have at The Big Crunch. Tipler thinks that life will be <br>
able to engineer the Universe so that when it contracts to a mathematical <br>
point, it will do so in a asymmetrical way, so one part of the sky will <br>
always be hotter than another thus you can always run a heat engine.   <br>
All life on Earth also gets it's energy from a hot spot in the sky that we  <br>
call "the sun", the Omega point would also have a hot spot, but the <br>
difference is it will keep getting hotter without limit, in other words <br>
infinite energy.<br>
<p>
You'd also need a way for the parts of the computer to communicate with the  <br>
other parts at a ever increasing speed, you can't move faster than light, so  <br>
the only way to do this is to make the distance between the parts shorter.  <br>
This is also exactly what you'd have at The Big Crunch. <br>
<p>
And You'd need infinite memory. Tipler found a way that the Universe could  <br>
hold an infinite amount of information, he wants to store information as <br>
standing waves and use the entire universe as a wave guide. As the universe  <br>
shrinks toward The Big Crunch the amount of time needed to access this  <br>
information is reduced too, but so is the amount of energy needed to store a<br>
bit of information, because you need to keep making your information storing <br>
photons at a shorter and shorter wavelength and that takes energy. If you <br>
only have a finite amount of energy this would be a fatal problem, but if the <br>
universe shrinks to a geometric point then the amount of gravitational sheer <br>
energy in the Universe would diverge to infinity, and as I said if the  <br>
collapse is not symmetrical then the energy is usable. <br>
<p>
There is a finite amount of time to the Big Crunch, but Tipler says that a  <br>
beam of light could circle the entire universe an infinite (and not just very <br>
large) number of times before then, because the universe will keep getting <br>
smaller without limit. In this way a finite amount of matter in a finite <br>
amount of time could produce a infinite number of calculations and so <br>
generate a infinite subjective time. To put it another way, the idea is to  <br>
trade energy for subjective time, we have infinite energy so we have infinite <br>
subjective time.<br>
<p>
As for Entropy, it's only a problem if it ever stops increasing as it would <br>
in the heat death of an open universe, in a closed universe the Entropy never <br>
stops increasing and the heat never stops increasing. Of course all of this  <br>
is irrelevant if the universe is open, and it's starting to look like it may <br>
be, we should know in a few years. Tipler also made a number of testable <br>
predictions, I'll get into that if you're interested.<br>
