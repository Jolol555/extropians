<i>&gt; : mean lifetime, I mean LIFETIME. I've seen people send in the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; : abused, messed up guns to be fully repaired or replaced at no charge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Anton couldn't hope to get that from his Vietnamese arms merchant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My Vietnamese arms merchant is an importer in Pennsylvania.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Three of my friends have SKS so I have ready sources of advice.</i><br>
<p>
An SKS is a nice gun, don't get me wrong. But buying American and<br>
getting a complete lifetime warranty are worth a lot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ceteris paribus I'd rather not buy from Ruger, because of his support</i><br>
<i>&gt; of evil legislation.</i><br>
<p>
What pray tell, is this "evil legislation"??? If I were to amend my<br>
buying habits for a business man's politics, I'd get rid of all of my<br>
microsoft products because Bill Gates heavily supported the group that<br>
broght the gun registration bill to a vote in Washington state this last<br>
election. I gave, I hear, at least a couple hundred thousand to the<br>
group. (Lord knows, now that I've posted this, Kathryn will probably<br>
dump her Mac and go out and get totally Wintelled.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did look at a Ruger rifle.  The sight picture was not as good,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it didn't feel quite as "right" in my hands, and it was another</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundred bucks or so (maybe all guns are cheaper in NH than in</i><br>
<i>&gt; California?).</i><br>
<p>
They probably are cheaper. We have hardly a fraction of the welfare<br>
state that CA has, so taxes of all kinds are lower than anywhere or<br>
nonexistant. I can also get them much cheaper because my father is an<br>
engineer at Ruger. Employees can purchase a gun at 40% discount every 6<br>
months.<br>
<p>
As to the sight picture: I have a brand new 10/22 rifle with a bull<br>
barrel and 8x scope. Its pattern is, what is known in the industry as a<br>
"one holer". I shoot a 1/2" pattern at 100 yards.<br>
<p>
I also have on loan, a .44 lever action. It has a 2" group at 100 yards.<br>
The accurizing techniques my father is enacting at the plant this winter<br>
should be appearing on new guns in the market by Feb-Mar that will<br>
reduce the group to less than 1" on average.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : The only thing I would criticize Anton about is that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How unimaginative.  You could criticize me for *lots* of things</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you'd been paying attention.  &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Nothing of late comes to mind. I tend to have a high tolerance level.<br>
