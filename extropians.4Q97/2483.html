From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;the 7:2 margin among American respondants does</i><br>
<i>&gt;heavily weight toward the original statement, that more subscribers on</i><br>
<i>&gt;average own guns than the general population</i><br>
<p>
Why do USA-only statistics give heavier weight to statements concerning<br>
extropian-subscribers ?<br>
As the extropian list is obviously made up of both USA and international<br>
subscribers, surely the heaviest weight should be given to figures that include<br>
both USA and international data.<br>
I thought you were linking the extropian *mindset* to *gun-ownership*.<br>
<p>
If the question is the link between extropian *mind-set* and gun ownership in<br>
the *USA* then you may aswell use the international figures as you can remove me<br>
from the "anti" and put me into the "pro-gun" column.  I don't believe in gun<br>
ownership for myself in my country, but would certainly own one if I was in the<br>
USA.<br>
You might find that the other two non-USA anti-gun owners would also change<br>
their vote if you asked them how they'd feel living without a gun in the states.<br>
Its a different question altogether than the one that was originally asked.<br>
