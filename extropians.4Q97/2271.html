<i>&gt; I seem to remember a Scottish study (sorry, no references ;( ) that found</i><br>
<i>&gt; a steady decline in sperm count for Scottish men in the last couple</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades. </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps a decline in the practice of wearing kilts? : )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was reading about some environmentalist movement</i><br>
<i>&gt; that had its roots in Germany.  They underlying doctrine of this group</i><br>
<i>&gt; was: if we kill ourselves, we'll be helping the environment.  Apparently,</i><br>
<i>&gt; some techno song supporting this meme (and created by a member) is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; top 20 list in Germany.  Can someone verify this? (especially those in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Germany)  It seems to me if these people exist, they pose the greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt; threat to human beings imaginable.  It seems only logical that the next</i><br>
<i>&gt; step in their logic would be "why don't we kill everyone else."  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; danger would be that these characters would take Kamakazi(excuse my</i><br>
<i>&gt; spelling) to a whole new level-- their objective would be to kill as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; people as possible including themselves.  I hope I don't sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; too paranoid, but if this group exists, they sound very dangerous.</i><br>

<i>&gt;From the Voluntary Human Extinction pages:</i><br>
<p>
	The Church of Euthanasia advocates what many think of when they hear<br>
	about VHEMT for the first time: suicide for Earth's sake. Founder<br>
	Chris Korda, in their newsletter Snuff It, (4) encourages those who<br>
	are truly serious about saving the planet to kill themselves. Also<br>
	offered are several creative ways to help the cause of voluntary <br>
	human extinction.<br>
<p>
	The Gaia Liberation Front (5) favors people killing each other as<br>
	 in wars, but prefers "hand-to-hand combat, or better yet,          <br>
	biological agents that kill only humans."<br>
<p>
Even if these are only unusually elaborate trolls, or inept Swiftian <br>
satire, they make my blood run cold....<br>
