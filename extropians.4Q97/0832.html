In a message dated 97-10-27 02:43:58 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The mantle is less dense than the core primarily because it's made of<br>
 different <br>
 material.  The core is solid metal, mostly iron.  The mantle is rocks<br>
 like silicates and carbonates.  Solid metal weighs quite a bit more those<br>
 rocks.<br>
 <br>
 Moving material from the core to the mantle or vice versa wouldn't change<br>
its<br>
 density. It would be the same stuff.  However, it would be nearly impossible<br>
 because of the weight difference.  Since the stuff is molten (more or less)<br>
 the iron would just sink right back to the bottom.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Ok, thats interesting, do you know of the relationship between the inner core<br>
and the outer core?<br>
<p>
also, i was just about to read the most previous post before this one that<br>
was also titled Re: earth/moon relationship, and then AOL kicked me out and I<br>
lost it, so could someone send it to me?<br>
<p>
thanks<br>
