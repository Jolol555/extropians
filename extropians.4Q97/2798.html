If you want to pick nits, Grafton County here in NH has not seen combat<br>
in the local area since the mid 1700's. We have always been much more<br>
heavily armed than even the average american.<br>

<i>&gt; : with predictable results.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Smallpox.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've recently read, if memory serves, that this happened at least once</i><br>
<i>&gt; in colonial days - fallout from one of those endless British-French</i><br>
<i>&gt; quarrels - but there's no hard evidence that US forces ever did it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For whatever that's worth.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, that last one I heard of was the Cherokee people after they<br>
were forced marched from Georgia to Oklahoma, and it was smallpox.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : There's a new case in this morning's newspaper involving a shooting</i><br>
<i>&gt; : outside a high school. When caught in school with a gun, it's argued</i><br>
<i>&gt; : whether or not suspending them is appropriate!!</i><br>
<p>
Yes, school used to be much more peaceful when hunter safety was taught<br>
in the school, the school had a rifle or trap team, and high school<br>
JROTC was a popular extra-cric activity. In those days, kids were taught<br>
through experience and with positive role models that guns required<br>
responsible handling. Blame the NEA.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not all schools are so lenient.  I keep hearing about children being</i><br>

<i>&gt; for giving one another Midol or aspirin or lemon-drops!</i><br>
<p>
Or the kid in kendergarten or 1st grade or some such who was suspended<br>
for kissing a girl, ugh. ;)<br>
