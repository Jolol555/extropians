<i>&gt; Or you can prove that all lines are composed of the same number of points</i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of length. Draw 2 parallel lines, a short one and a long one below</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, pick a point midway along the short line but above it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                            /\</i><br>
<i>&gt;                          /    \</i><br>

<i>&gt;                    /________________\</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Draw a line from that point to any place on the short line, then continue it</i><br>
<i>&gt; until you hit the long line. You've made a one to one correspondence between</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the points in the short line and all the points in the long line, so they</i><br>
<i>&gt; must have an equal number of points.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But not all infinities are equal. Let's try to put the integers in a one to</i><br>
<i>&gt; one correspondence with all the points in the line from 0 to 1 expressed as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decimal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         1 - 0.a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;         2 - 0.b1,b2,b3,b4,b5 ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;         3 - 0.c1,c2,c3,c4,c5 ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;         4 - 0.d1,d2,d3,d4.d5 ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;         .</i><br>
<i>&gt;         .</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The trouble is it doesn't work, there are decimals not included, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the point 0.A1,B2,C3,D4,E5 ... where A1 is any digit except a1, B2 is any</i><br>
<i>&gt; digit except b2, C3 is any digit except c3 etc. This point differs in at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least one decimal place with any point in our one to one scheme, we've used</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the integers but there are still points remaining, so there must be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; points on a line than integers.</i><br>
<p>
There are an infinite number of points between 0 and 1. There are an infinite<br>
number of points between 1 and 2. What about all the points between 0 and 2?<br>
There is an infinite number, yes, but it is composed of the points from 0 to 1<br>
and 1 to 2. Does this mean that the number of points between 0 and 2 is double<br>
that of both?<br>
<p>
No, it's just infinite. Does it really make sense to say that all infinities are<br>
not equal? I mean, infinity is used in mathematics thanks to a symbol that<br>
supposedly quantizes it, or at least allows us to represent the mathematical<br>
concept of infinity. But is infinity ever a quantity? We can't really ever grasp<br>
infinity anymore than we can grasp the size of [(10^100)^100]^100. The difference<br>
is that such big numbers (positive) have a meaningful upper limit that we can use<br>
to define its value. Infinity does not. So any number that does not have a<br>
meaningful upper limit (or lower limit, if negative) is equal to every other<br>
number that has no such limit. Infinity is infinity no matter in what context it<br>
occurs.<br>
<p>
If infinities are not equal (this infinity is greater than that infinity) then<br>
that means that some infinities are even larger, and then some infinities are<br>
even larger than that, ad infinitum. So then the ultimate infinity is the<br>
infinity that is larger than all the rest -- the inifinitely infinite infinity.<br>
But then what about an infinity even greater than that....<br>
<p>
Blah, blah, blah....<br>
<p>
There doesn't seem to be a worthwhile way to deal with this unless every infinity<br>
is just plain old infinity, unbounded, and -- to try to keep it within our<br>
semantic framework -- equal.<br>
