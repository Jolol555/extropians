This is from the October 1997 special Transportation issue of<br>
Scientific American page 28 "In Brief".<br>
<p>
I thought it of interest to the list, and possibly in particular,<br>
Extropian investors.<br>
<p>
This was a particularly good issue, there is an article on hybrid<br>
electric vehicles as recently discussed here.<br>
<p>
"Immortality" Gene Revealed<br>
<p>
Two teams of scientists-from Geron Corporation, the University of<br>
Colorado at Boulder, and the Whitehead Institute for biomedical<br>
research, among others-have cloned the gene for the human<br>
telomerase catalytic protein, the "holy grail" of aging research.<br>
This enzyme serves as a key of sorts for rewinding the celular<br>
clock: cells that produce telemerase, such as cancer cells, are<br>
immortal. Those that lack the enzyme have a limited life span. The<br>
researchers hope that by having identified the enzyme, they will be<br>
able to screen for drugs that can inhibit or activate it.<br>
Inhibitors might prove to be highly specific and potent anticancer<br>
agents, where-as activators may well ameliorate diseases caused by<br>
cell death, including Alzheimer's.<br>
