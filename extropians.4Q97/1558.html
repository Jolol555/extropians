Hi Anders, Thanks for the Definitions....<br>
<p>
:-&gt;UPLIFT: To increase the intelligence and help develop a<br>
culture of a previously non- or near-intelligent species. [From<br>
the Uplift novels by David Brin]<br>
<p>
Though one might ask, why one wants to change the species in the<br>
first place, is there any practical benefits from that ?<br>
Also if one uplifts human intelligence into dangerous animals ,...<br>
WOW.., Won't that be something like Aliens Resurrection.....<br>
I'd serious consider the re-percussions of such a move , or<br>
hold a referrendum on this issue....?!<br>
<p>
:-&gt;UPLOAD: (a) To transfer the consciousness and mental structure<br>
of a person from a biological matrix to an electronic or<br>
informationalmatrix ( this assumes that the strong AI postulate<br>
holds). The term "Downloading" is also sometimes used, mainly to<br>
denote transferring the mind to a slower or less spacious matrix.<br>
(b) The resulting infomorph person. [The origin of the term is<br>
uncertain, but obviously based on the computer technology term<br>
'uploading' (loading data into a mainframe computer].<br>
<p>
This makes more extropian sense, if you are to gather more<br>
information about our universe ; explore it and colonize<br>
it,....with self-replicating machines with Uploaded Human<br>
Intelligence in them or many-times; manifold mega-human<br>
intelligence onboard<br>
<p>
I'd always thought of the current space probes like Cassini etc..<br>
they are robots which have extended human senses ,...which<br>
is like a piece of you and me out there in harsh environment,...<br>
doing measurement and collecting data in our place,....<br>
<p>
Uploaded Machines can do much much much more,....<br>
That's great,... providing you have eliminated the destructive<br>
tendencies / low-reptitian etc etc aspect of our Human makeup<br>
Agreed? Or else we'll end up with a situation far worst than a<br>
runaway Uplifting scenario...Any suggestions ? ....headways ?<br>
<p>
:-&gt;In that case we'll start our own shop next door with<br>
competitive prices.<br>
<p>
In that case .... we weren't be around to open one though I wish<br>
to be there at the open ceremony, any plans how to start one ?<br>
I hope this is the humor section.....<br>
<p>
Thanks for your feedback<br>
