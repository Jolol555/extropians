<i>&gt;Fully</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;automatic weapons are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;military), and I suspect the same is true for most of Western</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Europe.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fully automatic weapons have been illegal to the average U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizen since the 1930's.</i><br>
<p>
Not quite, although that was the intent: average persons who wish to<br>
acquire a fully-automatic firearm have to pay a $200 tax for each<br>
firearm, get a local LEO to state in writing that he doesn't mind, go<br>
through full fingerprinting and a serious background check, and<br>
(typically) wait up to six months--sometimes to be told at the end of<br>
that time that the application has been denied.<br>
<p>
I guess anyone who can go through that gauntlet may indeed not qualify<br>
for the appellation "average". :}<br>
<p>
That's federal; there are different laws in different states. For<br>
example, in California it's virtually impossible to get a legal<br>
full-auto unless you are a special-effects supplier to Hollywood such<br>
as Stembridge.<br>
<p>
As an aside, since the US ban on new manufacture, rumor has it that<br>
movie companies sometimes hire machinists to build full-autos for a<br>
scene, shoot the scene and then destroy the weapons, all in flagrant<br>
violation of the law, just because THE WORLD (not just the USA) wants<br>
its shoot-em-up entertainment louder and nastier all the time.<br>
*Sigh*...<br>
<p>
Wonder why no one in Hollywood gets prosecuted for that...<br>
