A first rate post by Forrest Bishop &lt;forrestb@ix.netcom.com&gt;, but I can <br>
always find something to argue about.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Mars also may have so-called "fossil  fuel" deposits similar to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Earth's oil and natural gas reservoirs. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
But of course such fuel is useless without free oxygen, and even as a chemical <br>
feed stock I question its value, especially in an age of Nanotechnology.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It bugs me to see a concept [O'Neill-style colonization] named after         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;its popularizer.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I think you're being a little hard on O'Neill, the man did some original work <br>
and he asked a very deep question, "Is the surface of a planet the best place  <br>
for an advanced civilization?" His answer was no, and I think he was correct. <br>
Besides, naming a concept for its popularizer is a tradition, 2  continents  <br>
were named after one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;My reform proposals start with instant and total shutdown of the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Space Shuttle program. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
yes. Yes. YES! The space Shuttle started life as a terrible way to perform a  <br>
dangerous job that nobody wanted done, huge expense and inept management  <br>
did not improve things. Dump the white elephant.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This [solar power satellite stations (SSPS)] has been studied since         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the late '60s, it is just now starting to make economic sense. </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
At one time I was a big booster of SSPS, but now I have doubts they will ever <br>
make economic sense in delivering power to earth, I certainly wouldn't invest <br>
my own money in such a venture. It's possible to transmit power by microwaves <br>
from 22 thousand miles, I'm just skeptical of its practicality  given the <br>
alternatives. If you had a sky hook things would be very different, just send<br>
the power down a wire, but that's a project that makes even SSPS look modest.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Mining asteroids will, IMO, completely eliminate Earth mining. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I may be a wimp but the idea of using the Earth's atmosphere as a brake to <br>
slow down a large irregularly shaped asteroid to change its orbit, as some  <br>
have suggested, scares the hell out of me. I think there will always be a lot <br>
of opposition to crashing any asteroid larger than a small bus to the Earth, <br>
and if they were that small I wonder if it would be economic. Rather than <br>
pushing material down a gravity well it might be better for us to climb out <br>
and use the resources there.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The private Conestoga rocket of the early '80s was made from a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Minuteman booster. The company was destroyed by someone who notified         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;some obscure gov agency that dealt with export law. The spent booster         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;landed in the Caribbean, outside US territorial waters  and was, you        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;see, a form of "exporting  munitions".</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I didn't know that, but it's so crazy it must be true, nobody could make up <br>
something that dumb. That's our government in action! How sad.<br>
       <br>
