<i>&gt; The question isn't whether he's popular, but whether he's right.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, I just wanted to point out the fact that I'm not the only<br>
one that thinks his arguments are just plain wrong and that there are<br>
some very good resons for thinking so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Three-dimensional in your conscious mind? You mean there's a 3D</i><br>
<i>&gt; strawberry inside your head?</i><br>
<p>
	YES!  It is possible that the actual lay out of this 3D space<br>
is somewhat or even extremely distorted, like an autocad 3D model laid<br>
out on a hard drive is almost randomly distributed, but there is some<br>
evidence that this distortion isn't two extreme, at least within the<br>
visual cortex itself.  And if you think about it, it is much more<br>
efficient, having the layout somewhat 3D, for processing such<br>
information as edge detection and such.  The more the representation<br>
distorts from actual 3D, the more inter neuron communication there<br>
must be to comprehend the representations.  I have some papers on this<br>
that go into much more detail if your interested.<br>
<p>
	Also, 3D parts of our body are very clearly laid out in<br>
portions of the brain.  True, the hands are distorted to be much<br>
larger and dense than other parts of the body for obvious reasons, but<br>
the general 3D maps can clearly be seen.  If you stimulate the correct<br>
part of the brain while doing brain surgery, the person feels a<br>
sensation in the corresponding part of his body, not in his brain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Presumably this means that noone can ever perceive an elephant or</i><br>
<i>&gt; whale, since the 3D qualia wouldn't fit? And could you point to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualia, because I'd really like to see one?</i><br>
<p>
	When you are looking at a 6 foot Christmas tree, you think<br>
your perception of it is 6 feet tall when in actuality it is less than<br>
a centimeter in your visual cortex, depending of course on how close<br>
you are to it.  It only seems that big because it is in the proper<br>
preportions with all your other conscious visual knowledge.  Haven't<br>
you ever seen one of those brain pictures with the tree being<br>
projected onto the retina of the eye, and the corresponding image<br>
overlaid in the primary visual cortex which would be a representation<br>
of the tree in our consciousness in the visual cortex at the back of<br>
the brain?<br>
<p>
	Why do you think mountains on the horizon several miles away,<br>
the moon many hundreds of thousands of miles behind them, the sun many<br>
millions of miles behind it, and the stars many light-years behind it,<br>
all look like they are the same distance?  It is because there is only<br>
so much room in your visual cortex and these objects are all<br>
represented at the edge of this representational space in your mind.<br>
Again, the representation is obviously nothing like reality.  But it's<br>
hard for you to realize this because your representations are all you<br>
know.  But remember, you can abstractly cognisize about the difference<br>
between a light year and and several miles, even though these<br>
distances don't fit within your visual cortex without some distortion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And could you point to a qualia, because I'd really like to see one?</i><br>
<p>
	This is precisely the point.  We can point to more or less 3D<br>
spaces in our brain which must be some kind of neural corelate to<br>
conscious qualia.  If we stimulate a certain part of the visual<br>
cortex, a visual sensation occurs in the visual space that seems to<br>
the experiencer to be beyond his eye wrather than in his brain.  (If<br>
you really think abou this, if this were not true, artificial eyes<br>
would not be possible, yet more scientific proof...) The qualia must,<br>
in some way, be very closely related to such stimulation at that<br>
location in the brain.  Though we know the general location, we don't<br>
yet quite know what qualia are and how they are produced, and how they<br>
are unified together to make up our conscious knowledge.  Once we<br>
discover the answer to this question, we will have made the greatest<br>
scientific discovy to date and finally know what consciousness is<br>
fundamentally made of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a scientist I like to have some evidence for theories, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't providing any.</i><br>
<p>
	Some of what I say is assertions, but it is mostly rational<br>
reasons and scientific evidence which you seem to be ignoring or<br>
failing to comprehend.  My communication abilities aren't to swift so<br>
it is probably mostly my fault.  I apologize for this and appreciate<br>
your patience.  There is plenty of scientific evidence for all this<br>
stuff.  Most of it is in common every day thinking and experience,<br>
it's just that our common sense thinking about it is incorrect in some<br>
places (like you think the tree is really beyond your eyes).  Once you<br>
realize this it all makes perfect sense and the "common sense"<br>
contradictions and impossibilities become much more obvious and vanish<br>
with true acurate predicting understanding.<br>
