<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please consider a different label, such as "pro self defense", "pro</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Emphasis above mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I cannot understand how any Libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;atheist can not support the right of the individual to keep and bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;arms. ANything other than this seems extremely hypocritical to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about shortsighted? See the flagged part of your comment above.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Oh, that? I _delegated_ that nasty thing. Let them pick up the garbage and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fight fires while they're at it. zzz...zZzZZZZZ..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I specifically included that, and is the main bone of contention between<br>
individualists and statists. I myself would define the body to which<br>
defense may be delegated would be every able bodied adult, which is not<br>
so far off the Title X of the US Code which defines every able bodied<br>
male between the ages of 18 and 40 as members of the militia (keep in<br>
mind this dates back to the early formation of  our government, so of<br>
course women weren't counted at that point). Statists would say whittle<br>
this group down to a single monopolistic small omnipotent paramilitary<br>
force controlling an anarmed populace.<br>
<p>
WHile statists would paint Libertarians as advocating every man, woman<br>
and child for themselves, this obviously is not practical (which is the<br>
point of such propaganda, to make the Libertarian viewpoint, as defined<br>
by statist media, seem ridiculous). Anyone who has studied libertarian<br>
thought is familiar with the concept of private, competetive, free<br>
market law enforcement. THose of you who have read Vinge's short story<br>
_The Ungoverned_ are also familiar with this.<br>
<p>
At the heart of it, the right of the individual to keep and bear arms is<br>
possibly the most demanding right (which is possibly why it is in such<br>
disrepute with today's lazy bread and circuses populace), in that it<br>
requires the individual to take responsibility for the defense of<br>
themselves, and of their community. Most people in today's world of rush<br>
rush, maximum overtime work, etc, just dont have the time or energy to<br>
exercise this right. It also requires that the individual acknowledge<br>
that they may have to sacrifice their very lives to exercise this right<br>
when it counts the most, while the unarmed individual, in their blissful<br>
denial of responsibility, willingly place themselves at the mercy of<br>
criminals and governments (any terms that connotate both?? There doesn't<br>
seem to be much difference) in a form of Russian Roulette every day, and<br>
look on armed citizens as crazy. Excuse me?<br>
<p>
As extropians, we also expect to, in the future, have technologies,<br>
tools, at our common, everyday disposal which will make firearms seem<br>
like childrens toys. Will we one day have lobbying groups called<br>
Deathstar Control, Inc., Coalition to Ban Laser Stations, out to ban the<br>
private posession of planetbusting weapons, even for the peaceful use as<br>
mining equipment or interstellar communications or spacecraft<br>
propulsion? As extropians, we should even now recognise that we accept<br>
the responsibility to exercise our rights as individuals to the fullest<br>
of our abilities, that we deny that common governments have even an<br>
inkling of the ability to better decide for us how to live our lives.<br>
Because of this, we should also accept that it is our responsibility as<br>
extropians, as transhumans, to excercise our rights to master the<br>
responsible use of present day technologies, among which, guns and other<br>
weaponry used for defense of the individual are a part.<br>
<p>
Kathryn's idea of "moving beyond the use of force" seems nice, but how<br>
is it practiced when those who are not as advanced as the trans-Kathryn<br>
decide that she is an evil abomination to their religion and should be<br>
wiped out? We seem to be moving into a world where the most rude and<br>
repressive ideologies that still exist, due to the easy communications<br>
and transportation of our era, are able to exert their influence in the<br>
most advanced centers of culture and technology. Every Abdullah,<br>
O'Reilly, and Phan Tri seems to be able to travel the world and attack<br>
anyone who seems to not conform or to oppose their primitive beleifs.<br>
Additionally, as the singularity nears, the disparity between the<br>
technological haves and have nots will only get wider, leading to<br>
greater class resentment and strife, and technological possibilities,<br>
like cloning, genetic manipulation, and mind uploading will been seen by<br>
a large percentage of a still primitive population as perverse, evil,<br>
and "against God's will". <br>
<p>
The singularity will not be a pretty time, my freinds, and those who<br>
wilfully refuse to take action in their own immediate defense will not<br>
make it through that period. WHile Kathryn's work against abortion<br>
clinic bombers is admirable, and I salute her work, what she experienced<br>
fighting those bombers is, IMHO, nothing compared to what is in store<br>
for those who will continue to push the boundaries of technological<br>
possiblities. WHy? because as technology advances, such radicals will<br>
show no compunction against using technology to fight against those of<br>
us trying to advance the human race, much like the Unabomber was not<br>
opposed to building bombs to fight his war against technology. <br>
<p>
As technology advances, so will the weapons of such terrorists. Already,<br>
it is acknowledged in anti-terrorism circles that it is only a matter of<br>
time before some group uses anthrax or some other biological weapon<br>
against a population center. WE have already seen the Sarin bombing of<br>
the Aum Rykyo (sp?) in Tokyo a few years ago. I am pretty convinced that<br>
the only reason Ian Wilmut is opposed to human cloning is merely to hold<br>
off the fundamentalist assasins.<br>
<p>
And it is not like governments can go out and magically eliminate<br>
knowledge from the world. I myself know enough to be able to build<br>
several pretty powerful bombs out of household materials that are in my<br>
house right now. I know enough about explosives to be able to even make<br>
a bomb from a persons urine and feces.<br>
<p>
How do we progress, then, when it seems like the only 'peaceful'<br>
solution is to reprogram the entire populace's minds? THe solution is to<br>
arm oneself with the ability to present an active defense against those<br>
who would oppose such progress.<br>
