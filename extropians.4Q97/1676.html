First of all, let me be clear that the opinions I present in this post are<br>
those of myself only. I am not presenting the view of the Extropy Institute<br>
Board, and I am sure that I am not representing Tom's view. Tom and I tend<br>
to approach these issues somewhat differently. Tom's training being in law,<br>
he sees matters like this primarily from a legal mindset and takes very<br>
seriously his role in protecting ExI's interest in issues involving<br>
trademark and related matters.<br>
<p>
In my view, the question of Excedo's name is *not* an issue of trademark<br>
infringement. I'm not entirely sure whether Tom thinks it is a trademark<br>
issue in a legal sense, or only in some moral sense. However, I *do* agree<br>
with Tom's concern, in that I have no doubt that the name "Excedo" *would*<br>
cause some confusion. Those who disagree are overestimating the<br>
intelligence of the media and much of the public. If we were all already<br>
transhuman with intellectual augmentations, no problem! However, another<br>
transhumanist organization with a name begining with "Ex" *will* lead to<br>
some confusion. Having looked at the web site today, I am also concerned<br>
with the prominent arrow that goes from faint to bold in a style very<br>
reminiscent of the fuzzy to sharp images Extropy Institute uses to convey<br>
the idea of growing extropy.<br>
<p>
I don't find this issue a big deal. While I definitely do think some<br>
confusion will arise from "Excedo", *most* people will either not be<br>
confused in the first place, or will very soon be enlightened on finding<br>
out more. If we were talking about a Europe-wide organization, or an<br>
America-based organization, it might be a bigger issue for me. It would<br>
also certainly be more of an issue if the name were closer, beginning with<br>
"Ext..." rather than merely the first two letters.<br>
<p>
I do find it puzzling and frustrating that a group that explicitly (a) does<br>
not want to be part of Extropy Institute, and (b) does not consider itself<br>
Extropian, nevertheless would choose a name (and an arrow emblem) that will<br>
suggest Extropianism to many people. It seems clear to me that a more<br>
distinctive name would serve both organizations better.<br>
<p>
I've happy to see the constructive approach being taken by Berrie and<br>
Arjen. I'm impressed by the offer of a reward for coming up with an<br>
acceptable alternative name. (I do like Daedalus. Or: The Prometheus<br>
Transhuman Society...) That's the spirit. That's such a capitalistic<br>
approach that maybe you guys should reconsider whether or not you are<br>
Extropian. :-) <br>
<p>
Certainly Arjen and Berrie's attitude in regard to this issue strikes me as<br>
more enlightened and constructive than that of some others who have posted<br>
here. Some people just love to snipe. Ah well, that's only human.<br>
<p>
Again, I cannot speak for how Tom or other Board members will respond if<br>
the Excedo name is used. All I can say is that I would certainly be happier<br>
with a more distinctive name, and would feel more like putting effort into<br>
cooperation and support with the new organization in that case.<br>
<p>
The name issue aside, I'm thrilled to see organizational activity starting<br>
up in Europe. Anders and others in Aleph in Sweden have already done quite<br>
a bit, starting with Ander's single-handed Herculean web site, then the<br>
Aleph handbook and meetings. Other previously isolated individuals such as<br>
Eugene Leitl, Sarah Marr, and Nick Bostrom will no doubt become<br>
increasingly connected. The level of transhumanist interest in Europe<br>
clearly is growing at an accelerating pace. In recognition of that, the<br>
forthcoming issue of the ExI members' newsletter, Exponent, carries a<br>
feature on European Extropians.<br>
<p>
Finally, Arjen, I was not claiming that Extropianism is well known in<br>
Europe. Of course it is not. However, saying that probably not even a<br>
hundred have heard of it was so far off the mark, largely due to work I've<br>
done, that I had to correct that idea. I wouldn't even say that it's well<br>
known in the States, despite nine years of work and numerous media<br>
appearances. Even cryonics, after 25 years, is only just beginning to<br>
penetrate the awareness of a significant fraction of the population. The<br>
more of us there are spreading the ideas, the better. Let's just be careful<br>
to help put a spring in each others' step, not step on each others' toes!<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
