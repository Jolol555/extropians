I agree, although all of the posts on this thread so<br>
far have not added up to much compared to other<br>
threads. AFTER THIS MESSAGE, I will start addressing<br>
my purely co-ordination-al messages directly to those<br>
who have expressed interest. However, I think for the<br>
purpose of advertising that a Midwest Extropian<br>
get-together is being planned for Jan 10 somewhere in<br>
Chicagoland, we might be forgiven mentioning it here<br>
about once a week until the event, on the off chance<br>
that someone who didn't yet know who would want to<br>
would see the posts... like this:<br>
<p>
** There are plans afoot to have an informal<br>
gathering of Midwest Extropians on 10 January 1997<br>
somewhere in the Chicago area. Details are being<br>
worked out at this time. Interested people could<br>
follow this thread backwards or contact me at<br>
mesmith@rocketmail.com. My most recent count of<br>
interested people (including messages not posted to<br>
this list) is now seven. I encourage you to increase<br>
this number! **<br>

I agree. For the purpose of the hyperlinked archives,<br>
I will now start using the subject line "Midwest<br>
Extropians". However, I include this sentence as a<br>
link to the thread entitled "Chicago Extropians",<br>
which is really the same thread.<br>
<p>
Michael Bowling asked:<br>
"Are all prospective attendees 21+ yrs?"<br>
<p>
Good question. I am. Perhaps it would be more<br>
efficient to ask who isn't?<br>
