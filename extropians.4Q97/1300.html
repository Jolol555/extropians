Sorry, but this is nonsense; what difference would a dossier on BATF<br>
gun ownership make when they're collecting dossiers on your gun <br>
ownership in order to justify raiding you? Or a dossier on DEA <br>
dope-smoking? The only effect will be to ensure that the government<br>
are not hypocrites, or that they pass laws which allow them to behave <br>
in a manner which would be illegal for private citizens; already <br>
true in the case of the BATF, for example.<br>

You'll have to be pretty damn clever to assassinate or kidnap<br>
someone over the Net. As soon as your action moves into the real<br>
world you can be traced by traditional police methods. This is<br>
a non-issue.<br>

And how much, exactly, will sending thugs around to every house cost<br>
the government? Sure, they can still send thugs to beat me up, if<br>
they can find me, but that's a far more expensive task than <br>
collecting taxes. And I can simply move to a tax-haven.<br>
