<p>
You will get no argument from me on the philosophy of science<br>
issue, BUT in this particular case -- positive vs. negative or zero<br>
curvature -- doesn't the latter view cohere with a lot more data<br>
-- however scant the data for either may be?<br>
<p>
For the record, I have no problem accepting a theory which is not<br>
supported by shiploads of evidence, but I do have a problem<br>
accepting one that seems to contradict evidence.  In this area,<br>
one has to do some major handwaving to avoid some of the<br>
evidence.  Also, unlike, say, the example of the neutrino, where<br>
a major item of knowledge seemed to be contradicted by proton<br>
neutron decay, there is nothing like that going on here.  In other<br>
words, nothing to warrant acceptance of dark matter on the<br>
scale needed to make the universe closed.<br>
<p>
(For those unfamiliar with the neutrino example, what happened is <br>
basically this.  In nuetron decay it was discovered that they break<br>
down into an electron and a proton.  The paths, from cloud chamber<br>
tracks, between the proton and electron as they fled from the decay<br>
event was not as expected, exactly opposite -- the electron heading<br>
one way which the proton went in the opposite direction. To account<br>
for this Pauli guessed there must be another particle, the neutrino --<br>
so named for it being small and neutral in charge -- that took up the <br>
slack and preserved conservation of momentum.  The latter is the<br>
major item of knowledge seemingly contradicted by the evidence.<br>
It could have been that neutrinos were a fantasy, but later<br>
experiments proved their existence.  Ergo, Pauli's guess was a<br>
good one.  I believe the case with lots of exotic dark matter is NOT<br>
the same.  We don't have the same kind of weight with theories of<br>
cosmology.  At least, this is my judgment in the matter.  Sorry for<br>
the digression and I hope I recalled my history correctly.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It appears the universe is open, but I'm interested in why, if it does,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; do some still maintain otherwise.  What reasons do they have?  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are these reasons valid and tractable?  In the interim, we might do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; well to discuss/try to understand the idea of an open, globally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hyperbolic universe -- rather than be shackled to the current</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Standard model, which might become obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; One, but by no means the only, model of an open universe is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of David Layzer.  But even if his model is found to be faulty, any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; good theory of cosmology should be able to account for the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that the universe has a lot less mass than would needed to close</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it -- given current observations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or be so fitted to other observations that an examination for other </i><br>
<i>&gt;matter besides the observed matter is warranted.</i><br>
<p>
Certainly, but that position is already spoken for and widely<br>
accepted.  We need go no further than the current Standard<br>
Model and its supporters.  Let's assume, for the moment,<br>
that they are wrong.  What next?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; An aside: What are the probabilities and how are they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; measured in this area?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which probabilities and which area?</i><br>
<p>
You wrote:  "There are a multitude of other observed phenomena<br>
which align[sic] well with the theory of a closed universe, as well<br>
as theoretical reasons for believing that such a case is probable."<br>
I'm homing in on the last word and wondering why you think so.<br>
How is a closed universe theory more likely than an open one?<br>
