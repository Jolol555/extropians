<i>&gt; &gt; That position is dangerous, and doesn't solve anything. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It *does* prevent the destruction of important research material and</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment, so the most urgent problem is solved.</i><br>
<p>
The research material and equipment is expensive but insured; what I<br>
am arguing is not that research facilities and similar places should<br>
be left unguarded (there are enough problems with theft in normal<br>
institutions), but that extreme security measures 1) focuses on the<br>
wrong part of the problem, the symptom, and 2) is likely to create an<br>
even more explosive situation.<br>
<p>
If Frankenstein had had his lab in a small cottage inside the village<br>
instead of a forbidding castle in the mountains, the villagers would<br>
have been less inclined to storm him with torches and pitchforks.<br>
<p>
What we really need is to make people understand the new technologies<br>
with an open mind. Just educating them about how they work has the<br>
surprising effect of just polarizing the opinion (the<br>
pro-genengineering camp becomes more pro, the anti-camp more<br>
anti). This is very hard, but we need to do it or else we are going to<br>
need your defenses even in our homes ("A transhuman! Kill the ugly<br>
mutant!!").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; To quote somebody who was interviewed on Swedish television</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (unfortunately without the regional dialect which really made it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; funny): "There should be an end to progress so people can keep their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; jobs!". That view is dangerously common, and people in general fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; change despite the fact that it helps them in the long run. It is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; easy to use this fear to strike against proponents or technologies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; change such as genetic engineering, the Internet och</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transhumanists. Think about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've thought about it a lot. I don't see anyone attacking the internet now</i><br>
<i>&gt; or in the (near) future, unless it attacks us first (which is at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; theoretically possible). </i><br>
<p>
Take a look at the controversies about pornography on the internet,<br>
the spread of illegal information and terrorism. I don't know about<br>
dutch media, but here in sweden the coverage have tended towards the<br>
very negative. Several politicians have proposed some rather draconian<br>
measures to prevent the spread of this nastiness, but have failed<br>
largely due to party politics. The first time internet was mentioned<br>
seriously in a swedish movie it was of course a movie about<br>
international child pornography. However, the negative opinion is<br>
changing since at least 30% of all swedes now have access to the net,<br>
and are discovering that it isn't a swamp of evil or the cybernetic<br>
heaven, but a fairly boring/useful/useless place. But I guess that<br>
when people start to move to untaxable digital money, the government<br>
will see that as a direct attack.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Transhumanism might be attacked (regardless of what its proponents</i><br>
<i>&gt; might say or do) when it gets "too big for comfort".  Right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists are usually seen as a bunch of computer nerds with</i><br>
<i>&gt; silly SF fantasies, harmless Utopians. When there will be more the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government and the press and (thus) the public _might_ "rediscover"</i><br>
<i>&gt; them and some "incriminating evidence" will be fabricated to justify</i><br>
<i>&gt; persecution. Its been done time and again...</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. And frankly, it isn't that hard to find disturbing stuff in<br>
transhumanism that could easily be used against it. That is why we<br>
need to get our ideas into the mainstream as much as possible instead<br>
of trying to work in splendid isolation - we are vulnerable as a<br>
separate group.<br>
