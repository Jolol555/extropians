IAN: Like a broken record, I find myself spouting <br>
libertarian doctrine even as I've seen the flaw in <br>
the common application of libertarian moral theory: <br>
<p>
If a landlord uses force to evict me, or even if <br>
the contract says if I break his rules I go to a <br>
cell in the basement, libertarian doctrine does <br>
not see this as coercion, so long as I'm free <br>
to leave his property. <br>
<p>
The federal government is the landlord of the <br>
property known as the United States. The rules<br>
of the landlord  must be followed or penalty<br>
is effected.  It is not coercion so long as <br>
you are free to leave the U.S. property if <br>
you have a problem with the contract.<br>
<p>
As we can see, the U.S. property arrangement<br>
is not different than the "private property,"<br>
for we are free to leave the U.S., therefore <br>
the application of U.S. law is not coercion.<br>
<p>
You do not have to sign the contact to be<br>
compelled to abide by it. When I walk into <br>
a store, I still have to abide by their rules<br>
even if I did not sign a contact. Entry =&gt;<br>
agreement with the terms of the property.<br>
Thus to enter a preexisting claim is to <br>
agree to the rules therein, or not, in<br>
which case the landlord can use force<br>
according to libertarian moral theory.<br>
<p>
Also, if a child is born in an apartment <br>
and its parents die sometime thereafter,<br>
the landlord, in accord with libertarian<br>
theory, has the right to evict the child, <br>
to use force against the child, even as <br>
the child did not sign any contract.<br>
<p>
Libertarians seem to think that they have <br>
an inherent right to property upon which a<br>
preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.<br>
<p>
The only difference between the smalltime <br>
landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.<br>
Yet there is no libertarian rule that places <br>
a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,<br>
force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-<br>
ing claims of Native Americans, but none of <br>
the guilty are alive today. If we say that <br>
therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so <br>
too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-<br>
bably stands on once Indian territory.<br>
<p>
<p>
I think the importance of libertarianism<br>
lies in the utility of private property,<br>
such that people are more prosperous when<br>
individuals are allowed maximum control of<br>
areas that they purchase in exchange with <br>
others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)<br>
that owns a vast area wants his tenants to<br>
prosper, he will allow them a very high <br>
degree of liberty. He will allow them to <br>
control parcels of land and trade them.<br>
<p>
What makes the market work is the ease with<br>
which customers can exit a given establishment. <br>
What makes government not work is the difficulty<br>
with which customers can exist the country. This<br>
difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting<br>
the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy<br>
of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all<br>
comes down to size. This places emphasis on the<br>
need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this<br>
fixed and limited parcel of territory. <br>
