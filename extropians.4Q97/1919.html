I have to confess many Objectivists do fit this bill -- i.e., as inactive<br>
minded, parroting, ready-to-slander-their-opponents followers.  (Let's<br>
use capital O Objectivists to distinguish those people who are<br>
somehow influenced by Ayn Rand and her cohorts from small o<br>
objectivism, which I take to mean someone who believes that<br>
reality exists independent of the mind.)  However, you paint with too<br>
broad a brush.  Many Objectivists are reasonable people who do<br>
examine issues thoughtfully.  This seems to be true of the Institute<br>
for Objectivist Studies -- though even people affiliated with that<br>
group are sometimes dead brained.  There are also many splinter<br>
groups and individuals who are independent minded...  Too many<br>
to list here, but two examples are Peter Saint-Andre, whose web page<br>
is at:<br>

<p>
And Chris Sciabarra (author of _Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical_),<br>
whose web page is at:<br>

<p>
Take a look and judge for yourself.<br>
<p>
This said, the main issue in regards to this (or any) philosophy should<br>
be is any (or all?) of it valid?  That would, of course, go well beyond<br>
the discussion of an open vs. a closed universe.<br>
