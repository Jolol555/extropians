<i>&gt; In English, it takes a simple set of prefix and suffix additions to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; from "establish" to "antidisestablishmentarianism" -- how does Chinese</i><br>
<i>&gt; handle such things?</i><br>
<p>
Germans build big compound words, but Chinese just string many words<br>
(and small "particles") together.  The necessity to compound words is<br>
a result of treating words as single-function nouns or verbs.  In<br>
Chinese, one doesn't need separate words for the noun "tree" or the<br>
verb "to tree" (whatever that might mean), or the adjective "treeish",<br>
or the abstract quality of "treeness"; one simply places the word<br>
"tree" in context and along with particles that mark its use.  Even<br>
new nouns can be created by simple juxtaposition of old ones, as the<br>
symbols "tree, flower" used together mean "vegetation".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find it an exceptional advantage to be able to call across the country</i><br>
<i>&gt; or across the ocean and talk to people and understand them.  People today</i><br>
<i>&gt; having a hard time with Shakespeare and Chaucer is more an issue of</i><br>
<i>&gt; general illiteracy and lack of the Chinese reverence for the ancestors</i><br>
<i>&gt; than of phonetic drift.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the technology of the phone might have been different had our<br>
language suffered as much phonetic diversity as the Chinese; perhaps<br>
the telegraph would have been more useful, the symbol set much larger,<br>
and would have been automated sooner.  Or maybe facsimile transmission<br>
would have caught on earlier (it was invented early, it just didn't<br>
catch on until the 80's, because voice had always been more practical).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I understand it, each logograph in Chinese is a completely separate</i><br>
<i>&gt; word.  How many of them are there?  I seem to recall a number around</i><br>
<i>&gt; 40,000.  English has about 350,000 words.  Consequently, many things</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be said in fewer words in English than in other languages, offsetting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "fewer penstrokes per Chinese word" that you mention.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's a good point.  Chinese does use more words per thought<br>
than English, so the writing advantage probably isn't that big.  It is<br>
improved somewhat by the fact that Chinese is so horribly ambiguous.<br>
While one needs many more words to express a thought accurately, they<br>
generally don't bother.  <br>
<p>
(Hey, I made it through a whole post on linguistics without mentioning<br>
a certain favorite language...)<br>
