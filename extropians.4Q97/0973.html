In a message dated 97-10-29 14:08:29 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I seem to remember reading an article that stated that the very centre of<br>
 the core was a massive crystal(I think of iron)  How was this determined?<br>
 Well, don't quote me on this, but I think either someone shot some time of<br>
 EM radiation through the earth and measured it's distortion on the other<br>
 side (of course, the radiation would be altered differently depending on<br>
 how it entered the grain of the crystal)  Hmm... that doesn't sound like a<br>
 very likely scenario now that I think about it.  How about this: when an<br>
 earthquake occurs on the other side of the planet, you measure how long it<br>
 takes to go through the diameter of the earth.  The time it takes should<br>
 be influenced by the direction the shock wave passes through the crystal.<br>
 Apparently, the arrangement of the domains of this large iron crystal<br>
 explain the earth's large magnet field.  Also, one could explain pole<br>
 shift(not the kind Danny was talking about!) by the inversion of this iron<br>
 crystal, which might be induced by some external magnetic field... a large<br>
 metallic asteroid?  Sorry I'm being so vague... has anyone else read the<br>
 article to which I am poorly alluding?<br>

Hi, Ive read it somewhere too but cant recall why they think its a crystal.<br>
 A majority of their knowledge comes from earthquakes and hydrogen/nuclear<br>
explosions, and I've read a different article (discover(y?) magazine) on how<br>
they now know from waves from things like that, that the surface of the outer<br>
core is very jagged, definately not smooth, but they didnt say anything about<br>
a crystal, so puting the two together I've always thought of the outer core<br>
to be a crystal and the inner core being a much denser crystal, and the<br>
mantle being an ocean with currents and such playing off the energies of the<br>
core.  The dynamic relationship between the two crystals and the mantle must<br>
be very interesting. <br>
