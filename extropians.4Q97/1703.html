<i>&gt; I've seen the RM theory.  That's all good and well, but like Bohr, your</i><br>
<i>&gt; model suffers some serious defects when faced with all but the simplest</i><br>
<i>&gt; electronic structures.  Probabilistic wave functions work much better at</i><br>
<i>&gt; describing observable electronic phenomena than can be accomodated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterministic/discrete wave functions, especially as the electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures get more complicated.  I don't see any means by which you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; package your electron orbitals to make them look like the electron orbitals</i><br>
<i>&gt; that actually happen.  The Schrodinger wave functions are fundamental to</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern chemistry and work very well; *much* better than non-probabilistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; functions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So here's the problem, in short:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You would like us to discard a vast quantity of experimentally verifiable</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational chemistry in exchange for an "improved" theory that generates</i><br>
<i>&gt; a huge body of evidence to the contrary.</i><br>

      NoNoNo....   'RTFM'!!!  &gt;:-}  Relational Mechanics _subsumes Quantum <br>
      Mechanics_ as a -- statistically-based -- approximation method.  We <br>
      often use approximation methods in physics, as auxilliary hypotheses <br>
      to the 'core programme' of RM.  So you don't have to give up a handy <br>
      computational 'short-cut' -- RM provides deeper, more secure and <br>
      content-laden foundations for even greater computational advances.<br>
<p>
      Schwartzchild has priority for the basic 'QM' idea anyway:  As I say <br>
      quite clearly in my RM paper:<br>
<p>
<p>
     "In a little-remarked paper, Schwarzschild [1903] had shown that<br>
      Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in the form of a set of <br>
      equations of motion of a system of particles, thus anticipating the <br>
      'wave-mechanics' of de Broglie and Schrodinger by several decades. <br>
      All that is needed, in addition to this, for the development of <br>
      modern 'wave mechanics', is a form of the statistically-based <br>
      Heisenberg 'indeterminacy relation.'<br>
<p>
      Schwartzchild showed that the equations of a beam of electromagnetic <br>
      waves, as deduced from Maxwell's theory, can be recast in the form <br>
      of the Lagrangian equations for a stream of particles.  A moment's <br>
      thought should show that all wave theories in fact derive from the <br>
      study of particles of various kinds - elementary particles, atoms, <br>
      molecules - interacting either by means of forces acting over a <br>
      distance, or by direct contact."<br>
<p>
<p>
      I would ask you to distinguish between the 'world-picture' of RM, <br>
      which is founded upon its underlying core programme, and the handy <br>
      short-cuts used by -- auxilliary -- approximation methods. (Ritz's <br>
      Approximation Method is another famous illustration).  Also read how <br>
      Walter Ritz calculating Chladni figures, through 39 iterations <br>
      ISTR...<br>

      Your interest is appreciated, James.<br>
<p>
      Sincerely,<br>
