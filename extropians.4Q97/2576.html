In case there's a chink to logical thought somewhere...<br>

Indeed.  You can make a functional handgun with standard machine tools,<br>
I've heard.  It won't be professional quality, it might break after a<br>
few hundred shots, but it'll suffice to mug someone.  Or kill.  How can<br>
you eliminate such guns?<br>

Certainly guns are meant to kill.  They're meant to kill creatures<br>
trying to kill me, human or not.  Perhaps you've forgotten about wolves<br>
and great cats?  They're not much of a threat now... because they've all<br>
been shot.  I'd hate to lose guns while they're still around.<br>

<p>
"Totally unified society" is not something we all understand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; these weapons had never been invented, imagine how many wars could have been,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and will be avoided if men walked onto the battle field armed only with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sword.  When you don't have the comfort a multi-billion dollar war plane to</i><br>
<i>&gt; aid you so you don't have too see the faces of all the human beings you kill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you tend to think twice about going to war.</i><br>
<p>
Really.  My my.  That is not the impression I get from history.  I'm<br>
pretty sure I've read about lots of wars in the distant past.  The<br>
Persian Wars, the Peleponesian wars, Alexander the Great, the<br>
thousand-year history of Rome, the Mongols, the early Islamic Empire...<br>
all these people thought twice about going to war?  I'd hate to see what<br>
happened when they only thought once.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; more blood won't be spilt.  There is no valid purpose today to own or use a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun, unless you are an enforcer of the law, and it is absolutely dire that</i><br>
<p>
And we can all trust all of the enforcers of the law!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you think that gangs would be as previlent today if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the members went around armed with wooden sticks?  </i><br>
<p>
"Feudalism."<br>
<p>
It's amazing how the Cold War, the nuclear era, was one of the most<br>
peaceful periods in Europe's entire history.  It still is peaceful,<br>
apart from some fringe areas like Yugoslavia that don't have anything<br>
more advanced than primitive artillery, and a bad distribution of guns.<br>
<p>
Try this idea out: danger is not in how much deadly power is available.  <br>
It's in how it is distributed.  The left doesn't like concentrations of<br>
wealth, of _productive_ power; it's amazing that they don't see the<br>
necessity of ensuring equality of destructive power.  One person with a<br>
sword isn't as deadly as a person with a gun... but it's hard to become<br>
a good person with a sword, so those who do, rule.  Guns are easy.  Guns<br>
are democratic.  There are rather few stable democracies which predate<br>
the gun.  Iceland, perhaps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; do just that, to me, is plain wrong.  Perhaps if people repected that power</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but people do respect that power... especially when other people<br>
wield it.<br>
