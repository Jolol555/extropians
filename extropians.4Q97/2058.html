The problem is even worse.  Most people conflate capitalism with<br>
authoritarianism BECAUSE these ideas are usually thought of in<br>
terms of "package deals" -- to use Rand's term.  An example of a<br>
package deal in another field is equating atheism with Darwinism<br>
-- or even the specific state of evolutionary theory at a given time.<br>
This is often done so that one can reject one idea by its chance<br>
association with others.  In the atheist example, theists often argue<br>
against a specific theory or aspect of a biological theory and then<br>
say, "Aha, this theory is faulty, therefore, atheism in untenable and<br>
you should follow my laundry list of religious tenets."<br>
<p>
The same happens with capitalism.  A good example in the Third<br>
World is the confusion of capitalism with colonialism.  People tend<br>
to see the various colonial powers as capitalistic - even though<br>
imperialism is an example not of market exchange but brute<br>
governmental force -- and hence wind up being against capitalism.<br>
<p>
(I'm not well read in memetics, but Rand's notion of a package deal <br>
should be incorporated into the theory, as it explains the spread or<br>
lack thereof of many ideas.)<br>
