More worrisome is the fact that the closer you get to the event horizon,<br>
the time dilation effect becomes stronger and the black hole appears<br>
hotter. The blue-shift of the cosmic background radiation is actually a<br>
benefit, since you can take advantage of its higher temperature to run a<br>
heat engine between it and the black hole. A proper design for a black<br>
hole refrigerator would definately have to take relativistic effects into<br>
account.<br>
<p>
I think the formula I gave earlier for black hole temperature is the<br>
temperature apparent to an observer far away from the event horizon. Can<br>
anyone confirm this? <br>
