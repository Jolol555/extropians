<p>
The force doctrine doesn't imply that *firearms* are necessary to<br>
preserve freedom. It merely requires that an individual have the right<br>
to keep and bear arms. I agree that this essential point is obvious and<br>
unassailable in light of the Second Amendment. Much of the debate going<br>
on around here concerns whether firearms are a practical means to this<br>
end.<br>
  <br>
Firearms are easy to make, relatively inexpensive, and the most powerful<br>
type of weapon the average person can get. In this regard, they seem to<br>
be the most practical choice for self-preservation. <br>
<p>
However I'm not so sure that the production costs of firearms reflect<br>
the external costs associated with their distribution. Firearms are<br>
practical in large part because they are so inexpensive. But are they<br>
artificially inexpensive? Shouldn't the price of purchasing a firearm<br>
mirror the increased risk to self, and others even if only accidental<br>
harms are involved?<br>
<p>
The purpose of a firearm is to throw metal at high speeds, over a<br>
considerable distance, with accuracy. We all know that the intent of<br>
such a stated purpose is to make killing more efficient.   <br>
<p>
A tool used for killing is useful only insofar as the probability of<br>
causing death increases with its at-will use in a wide variety of<br>
circumstances. Firearms seem practical for self-preservation in large<br>
part because they are useful by this standard. Consider that a nail-gun<br>
has the same general purpose as a firearm (throwing metal at high<br>
speeds) and would suffice to kill something, but its effectiveness for<br>
killing is limited (a nail-gun has a short range, it is heavy, it<br>
requires a pretty powerful compressor, it is inaccurate, etc.) In short,<br>
it is an impractical killing device.<br>
<p>
Now, the point: the purchase price of a nail-gun may not reflect the<br>
external costs of accidental harms, but it also does not reflect the<br>
external benefits that result from its use for the purposes it is<br>
designed for and the purposes it accomplishes most efficiently. A<br>
firearm designed for the express purpose of making killing more<br>
efficient has external benefits only insofar as killing something can be<br>
a benefit (rare and isolated situations which constitute a separate<br>
issue).<br>
<p>
However, this analysis neglects to weigh a possible external benefit<br>
involved in throwing metal at high speeds, over considerable distances,<br>
with accuracy. Namely, it is amusing for some people. Does this benefit<br>
(in the aggregate) outweigh or equal the aggregate costs of accidental<br>
death? I would guess that it probably doesn't.   <br>
<p>
If this is so, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is<br>
telling us, and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring<br>
your own personal autonomy and freedom.   <br>
