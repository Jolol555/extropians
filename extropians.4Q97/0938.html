Yea, if "they" want to talk to us at our present level of development, <br>
their signal would be of lower bandwidth.<br>

If a light signal were modulated with a significant chunk of the available<br>
bandwidth, say, &gt;1% of it, the modulation would be too fast for our<br>
(standard) detectors to notice.  The signal power would be detected,<br>
and the overall power spectum, but not the modulation.  If it is modulated<br>
as fast as we are likely to be able to do with nanotech, which I'm<br>
estimating at at least 1 terahertz (based on the reported, computed,<br>
wiggle rates of some nanotech mechanical structures), there is little need<br>
to use the bottom few percent of available bandwidth.<br>
<p>
And as I mentioned, the overall power spectrum of the signal could be<br>
disguised as anything else. Some current military spread spectrum<br>
transmissions cannot be distinguished from background noise even if you<br>
plug the output of the transmitter directly into your RF spectrum<br>
analyzer. <br>
