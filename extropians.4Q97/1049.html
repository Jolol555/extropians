Hi Everybody,<br>
<p>
This evening the inner circle of Excedo met in Utrecht to socialize,<br>
eat/drink and discuss plans. Aside from the usual discussions about all<br>
kinds of ideas and technologies (some explanations on the bean-stalk were<br>
in order ;-) we also did some practical work.<br>
<p>
Henri has been working on our website (not just him, but he did most of the<br>
work). Soon it will be launched, including an english part. Both Berrie and<br>
Dalibor have made contributions to the site in the form of articles, some<br>
of it will be translated to english as soon as we get the basics<br>
up-and-running. Since Berrie is a bit overworked and I'm back in the<br>
world/normal life, I'll be taking over the work he started on the creation<br>
of a single document to bring 'newbies' up-to-speed on the basics of<br>
Transhumanism and Extropy. For us this will be most usefull to introduce a<br>
whole 'package' of memes to potential new members. Personally it think it<br>
would be a great idea to have a single text that contains all the basic<br>
stuff we more or less agree on. Emphasizing the similarities between the<br>
various local Transhumanist organisations would help in positioning<br>
Transhumanism as a truly global movement.<br>
<p>
There are already many good texts on the web that will provide pieces of a<br>
general introductory text, I'll cook up something this week, post it and<br>
hope it will grow into something usefull with help of many thinkers and<br>
writers on this list.<br>
<p>
We are all very enthousiastic about a European network/list/gathering.<br>
Aside from sharing of information and social events we could cooperate on a<br>
legal and organisational framework for Cryo-suspension. Dalibor den Otter<br>
is now a full-fledged Alcor member (first in the Netherlands!) and is very<br>
anxious to get underway with the practical problems of creating a 'rescue<br>
service' for European Alcor members. We still have a long way to go on the<br>
European mainland before anyone can feel safe that reaction-time willl be<br>
short enough and all authoroties will cooperate in allowing a person to be<br>
suspended. Dutch law at this point does not allow freezing deanimated<br>
persons or storing them in a privately owned facility. We're going to work<br>
on influencing the media and institutions like the Dutch Cancer Foundation<br>
who have contacts with many politicians. Meanwhile we'll all get a mobile<br>
phone, carry a document with instructions and keep our fingers crossed ;-)<br>
<p>
We also discussed changing the name of the society because some people<br>
think it might be confused with Extropy (both have Ex in 'em). Any ideas<br>
(English or Latin) are welcome and will be considered. We'll keep you<br>
informed.<br>
<p>
More on all this later, now my limited body needs to get a few hours sleep,<br>
I have a meeting in five hours :-(<br>
<p>
greetings,<br>
Arjen<br>
<p>
<p>
