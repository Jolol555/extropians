This can also be done with a simple automaton that blocks e-mails from<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand this. If there are Luddites out there who want to hunt</i><br>

<i>&gt; they should stay off all lists, or post anonymously.</i><br>
<p>
I think some extropians should be justifiably disturbed by the rise of<br>
violent luddites.  If the unibomber was still active, I would advise you<br>
to be wary of your mail!  A copy-cat unibomber can't mail a bomb through<br>
e-mail, so contributing to the list is fine.  Maybe if you gave a greater<br>
assurance of privacy in releasing our vital stats from ExI, it would<br>
eliminate this paranoia. (As EvMick said, a little paranoia is a good<br>
thing)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Geoff Smith says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The fact that you have to pay at least $100 dollars to join an institute</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to participate on a general extropian mailing list reeks of one of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cults where the members are wearing rags, and the leader is driving around</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in a Mercedes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, it's $95 (less for those with special arrangements), not "at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; $100", and it's $30 for students. Perhaps you didn't intend it this way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Geoff, but the way you put it is sadly reversed. Many ExI members and</i><br>
<i>&gt; potential members have very well paying jobs. Meanwhile, a number of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; most active in getting things done work for nothing or for absurdly little.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm embarrassed to admit that instead of driving a Mercedes, I drive an old</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ford with well over 100,000 miles on it, and until very recently I didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; even have that. I live with a large amount of credit card debt thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt; working for ExI for extremely little instead of getting "a real job". And I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am the *only* person who ExI has ever paid any kind of salary to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your comment reminds me of a my very first TV appearance -- in England on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the morning news in 1987 when I debated a Prof. of Surgery on cryonics. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; we left the studio, the fellow turned back to me and sneeringly said "I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure you'll make a lot of money." Knowing how the folks at Alcor had worked</i><br>
<i>&gt; for years for so little, this cheap shot made me furious.</i><br>
<p>
I apologize for infuriating you, I was definitely not insinuating *you*<br>
were driving a Mercedes.  I think everyone here appreciates the work you<br>
have done with little *cash* return; however, I think if I were in your<br>
position, I would be more than satisfied with the things you have received<br>
that have no cash value.(eg. the massive exposure of your ideas, the new<br>
friends and connections you have made, etc..)  I don't think being a<br>
capitalist means you can't appreciate those things that cannot be bought.  <br>
<p>
On the other hand, I do so the need for more money to ExI.  I guess I<br>
still hope that you will not get this money by charging to contribute to<br>
this list.  I think this list is a wonderful place for newbies to watch<br>
for a while, then throw out a couple of replies and watch the seeds of<br>
their ideas grow into new threads.  With a $95 fee, this will become a<br>
rare phenomenon.  <br>
<p>
In reading your e-mail, a question pops into my head: What is your<br>
motivation for creating the Extropian movement?  I highly doubt it is to<br>
make money, there are many easier ways of doing that.  I know if it was<br>
me, my motivation would be to create a world that is open to my ideas,<br>
that supports my values... a world that can provide constructive criticism<br>
to my radical philosophical ramblings.  I think others may share my view.<br>
Recently, I have been thinking about how I might help the extropian<br>
movement.  Whatever this may involve, I would not expect a salary.  I<br>
often spend time spreading transhumanist memes (something that seems very<br>
easy in a university), and I do not consider this work at all.  It is<br>
exciting that so many people are open to these ideas!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Kathryn: I wish there were more like you -- transhumanists who actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; *do* something. Currently you are contributing to the Institute's work by</i><br>
<i>&gt; acting as an editor for Extropy Online. We will be very happy to work out</i><br>
<i>&gt; breaks for members who are not rolling in money and who are contributing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; other ways. You are such a person.</i><br>
<p>
This is a great idea.<br>
<p>
<p>
Geoff.<br>
