Daniel Druckman and John A. Swets, eds, *Enhancing Human Performance:<br>
Issues, Theories, and Techniques*, National Academy Press, 1987.<br>
<p>
Here's a bit from my book THE LOTTO EFFECT:<br>
<p>
================================<br>
<p>
It was distinctly creepy, when the full report from the Committee on<br>
Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Performance was published in 1988,<br>
to read of `an initiative within the Army to consider techniques based on<br>
paranormal phenomena, for example, extrasensory perception to view remote<br>
sites and psychokinesis to influence the operation of distant machines.'<br>
		<br>
Had the Defense Department gone mad?  Not entirely.  The Committee did not,<br>
for example, examine the credentials of the Flat Earth Society.  It<br>
neglected to study the guidance and ancient wisdom said to be available<br>
from the stars, unlike its Commander-in-Chief who, it was later revealed,<br>
never took a consequential step without the all-clear from Nancy's<br>
astrologer.  <br>
<p>
The methodologies under scrutiny were more sober than that - but only just.<br>
 Apart from parapsychology, various programs meant to boost psychological<br>
cohesion and effectiveness were perused.  Suggestive Accelerative Learning<br>
and Teaching, for instance, employs `a combination of physical relaxation,<br>
mental concentration, guided imagery, suggestive principles, and baroque<br>
music with the intent of improving classroom performance'.  This discipline<br>
has its own academic journal, based at Iowa State University.  Hemispheric<br>
Synchronisation, or Hemi-Sync, is advocated by an early out-of-body<br>
enthusiast, Robert Monroe, and purports to do you good by running a<br>
binaural beat into your head through two earphones.  SyberVision uses<br>
expert coaching by videotape, augmenting your powers via mental rehearsal.<br>
NeuroLinguistic Programming is perhaps the best known, a kind of New Age<br>
hot-tub behaviourism meant to put you in charge of the control procedures<br>
said to script and orchestrate our lives - just what the Army needed to<br>
spruce up its officer training regime.<br>
<p>
By and large, the results reported were disappointing.  None of these<br>
technique packages were thought likely to turn out supermen.  Learning<br>
during sleep, for example, was debunked.  Hemi-Sync's bid to integrate the<br>
two cerebral hemispheres failed to impress the Committee, as did `attempts<br>
to increase information-processing capacity by presenting material<br>
separately to the two hemispheres', which is rather a shame.  Visual<br>
concentration was written off.  Still, the Committee did recommend<br>
follow-ups on several lines: accelerated learning, biofeedback, and<br>
NeuroLinguistic Programming - even though it found `no scientific evidence<br>
that neurolinguistic programming is an effective strategy for exerting<br>
influence.'<br>
<p>
==================<br>
<p>
...less saliently...<br>
<p>
==================<br>
<p>
Indeed, even a cursory reading of the very sprightly chapter `Paranormal<br>
Phenomena' in Enhancing Human Performance suggests that right from the<br>
outset the committee had its tongue well over into its cheek.  This is the<br>
way avowals of the paranormal are outlined:<br>
<p>
`The claimed phenomena and applications range from the incredible to the<br>
outrageously incredible.  The "antimissile time warp", for example, is<br>
supposed to somehow deflect attack by nuclear warheads so that they will<br>
transcend time and explode among the ancient dinosaurs, thereby leaving us<br>
unharmed but destroying many dinosaurs (and, presumably, some of our<br>
evolutionary ancestors).'  <br>
<p>
Who is alleged to be making these preposterous claims, here presented as if<br>
they are representative of the parapsychological research community?<br>
Anyone who has laboured through the statistics-encrusted pages of the<br>
Journal of Parapsychology will be dazed at the impertinence of this passage.<br>
<p>
The committee had not exhausted their fun and games.  `Other psychotronic<br>
weapons,' they added, `such as the "hyperspatial nuclear howitzer", are<br>
claimed to have equally bizarre capabilities.  Many of the sources cite the<br>
claim that Soviet psychotronic weapons were responsible for the 1976<br>
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, as well as the 1963 sinking of the<br>
nuclear submarine Thresher.'<br>
<p>
Of course, this is good funny copy, a hoot.  The only question is, if<br>
serious parapsychology were as off the wall as this, why would the US Army<br>
be shelling out bucks to inquire into its possible contributions to<br>
national security?  Of course, it's not - this is persiflage, intended to<br>
alert professional onlookers to the light-hearted sense of fun with which<br>
the luckless committee members are pressing on with their unwanted task of<br>
mucking out the stables.  (It's a filthy job, but someone's gotta do it.)<br>
<p>
What kind of evidence would have satisfied these scrutineers?  General<br>
objectives are listed: `replicability, robustness, lawfulness,<br>
manipulability, and coherent theory'.  It is granted in advance that<br>
mainstream parapsychologists deny the likelihood of finding strict<br>
replicability, a position based on many years of experiments which<br>
nevertheless present other kinds of lawful recurrence.  So in order to<br>
apply their own criteria, `the entire committee made a site visit to Cleve<br>
Backster's laboratory in San Diego', the sole on-site `experiment'<br>
witnessed and reported.<br>
<p>
The knowledgeable reader's jaw sags.  Cleve Backster's laboratory?<br>
Backster, as the report notes, `is a polygraph specialist who had at one<br>
time helped develop interrogation techniques for the Central Intelligence<br>
Agency and now runs his own polygraph school in San Diego'.  By no stretch<br>
of the imagination is Backster a research parapsychologist.  His small fame<br>
derives from reports of his rather silly and notably sloppy experiments<br>
with sensitive mind-reading philodendrons in the grotesque 1970s'<br>
bestseller The Secret Life of Plants, by Peter Tompkins and Christopher<br>
Bird.  <br>
<p>
With a straight face, the committee members watched one of their number<br>
spit into a tube and then attempt to influence the electrical activity of<br>
his shielded sputum leucocytes from another room.  Amazingly enough,<br>
Backster's program failed to rate highly with the committee - and, by<br>
rhetorical decree, was imagined to take the reputation of serious<br>
parapsychologists with it down (as it were) the tube.<br>
<p>
<p>
=========================<br>
<p>
If the parapsychology community doubted that their claims had even got<br>
through the door, one sees that there was more than paranoia involved in<br>
this suspicion.  In their reply, they point out that another background<br>
paper (along the lines of the one provided by Alcock), commissioned from<br>
Monica Harris and Robert Rosenthal from Harvard, was effectively<br>
`disappeared' when its conclusions proved disagreeable to Hyman.  <br>
<p>
Suppression of evidence?  Consider their case:<br>
<p>
`Rosenthal is a leading social science methodologist and a pioneer in the<br>
development of meta-analytic techniques...' write Palmer, Honorton and<br>
Utts.  Such techniques were used by both Hyman and Honorton in their famous<br>
debate over the reality of Ganzfeld, and permit a batch of heterogeneous<br>
studies to be correlated and boiled down into a single robust measure,<br>
despite surface differences.  <br>
		<br>
`These authors undertook a comparative study of the major topics reviewed<br>
by the Committee [that is, including sleep-learning, motivational, NLP,<br>
etc] and concluded that "only the Ganzfeld ESP studies... regularly meet<br>
the basic requirements of sound experimental design"...  On a 25-point<br>
scale of "overall quality", the Ganzfeld experiments were given a rating of<br>
19, whereas the other (nonparapsychological) areas reviewed received<br>
ratings from 3 to 13.'<br>
		<br>
In other words, on methodological grounds, the paranormal data were more<br>
solid than any of the other candidates.<br>
<p>
This is not the kind of report that members of the executive committee of<br>
CSICOP enjoy hearing from their consultants.  It is the kind of thing that<br>
might make a skeptic think again.  Well, no, actually.  The published<br>
chapter in Enhancing Human Performance doesn't mention Harris and<br>
Rosenthal, though their findings are cited in the chapter on Accelerated<br>
Learning.  Still, this omission by itself does not constitute evidence for<br>
suppression.  What does is quite breathtaking:<br>
<p>
`Incredibly, at one stage of the process, John Swets, Chairman of the<br>
[overall] Committee, actually phoned Rosenthal and asked him to withdraw<br>
the parapsychology section of his paper.'  Rosenthal refused to do so.  A<br>
certain toing and froing ensued.  `The overall behaviour of the Committee,'<br>
conclude Palmer and his co-writers, `suggests that it was eager to give<br>
Rosenthal's dissenting views as little exposure as possible.'<br>
<p>
==================<br>
<p>
...but I digress...<br>
