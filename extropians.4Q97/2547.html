"Michael M. Butler" &lt;butler@comp*lib.org&gt; writes:<br>
<i>&gt;TANSTAAFL is an acronym for "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lunch"--first (to my knowledge) used in Robert A. Heinlein's novel _The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Moon Is A Harsh Mistress_. It communicates the sentiment that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually get what you pay for, and that things that are labeled "free"</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually have some hidden cost.</i><br>
<p>
In general I agree that this is true, but there are some extremely<br>
notable exceptions.  The one that pops to my mind is Linux, and much of<br>
the GNU/FSF (Free Software Foundation) software.  Both Linux and GNU<br>
produce software that is generally better(*) than similar software<br>
produced commercially.<br>
<p>
(*) "Better" is a loaded word.  Linux &amp; GNU software is better in many<br>
well-defined ways, like reliability and breadth and depth of<br>
functionality.  (Since they're both Unix-based packages, I'm not making<br>
any claims about quality of user-interface compared to Windows or<br>
MacIntosh, for example.) Linux is a superior operating system than any<br>
commercial Unix that I'm aware of, in that it is more reliable, and has<br>
everything that most other general-purpose Unices have, and also have<br>
some very nifty, clean, advanced features that few, if any, other<br>
operating systems have.  And it is completely free.  GNU software is<br>
similar; it is completely free, and the mature products are just as<br>
good or better than anything available commercially.  This is why, for<br>
example, Sun has stopped shipping a C compiler by default (they still<br>
have one, but they don't ship it unless you wan it), and are telling<br>
their users to use GNU CC.<br>
<p>
The interesting question is "Why are Linux and GNU so successful, given<br>
that they are written by people who aren't being paid?"  The answer, at<br>
least in part (and in my opinion almost entirely), is because the<br>
people who write the software do it on their own time, because they<br>
*enjoy* writing good software.  An important practical factor in this<br>
equation is that there are no deadline pressures to "get a product<br>
out".  So things get done slowly, but they get done *right*, and they<br>
get it done right *the first time*, usually.<br>
<p>
I think this is a beautiful example of how a non-commercial entity can<br>
come up with a staggeringly successful product that simply blows away<br>
the competition.  "Successful" is also a loaded word; nobody is getting<br>
rich, but the product is clearly technically superior to anything else<br>
available.<br>
<p>
I don't claim that an economy can be based on such products, because<br>
most people work because they *have* to, not because they enjoy their<br>
work.  The people who write GNU and Linux do it mostly because they<br>
enjoy it.  ("Bragging rights" comes into the picture as well,<br>
sometimes.)<br>
<p>
I'd be interested in hearing other notable exceptions to TANSTAAFL.<br>
