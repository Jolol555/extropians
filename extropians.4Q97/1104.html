I wrote some text last Spring about the "solar-oblateness" concepts<br>
relating Einstein's GR and Dicke's modification, and where Mercury's<br>
perihelion advance fits in the story. Seems to be appropriate to post <br>
some of that text here..<br>
<p>
(I really don't have the time to jump in the middle of this heavy <br>
discussion. But I have some comments.)<br>

<i>&gt; {X1} Mercury's Perihelion Advance</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ============================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     While it was for a long time the strongest argument for it, this is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;now considered a corroboration of Einstein's theory.  There was an observed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;long-standing and acknowledged anomaly between the classically predicted</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement of the planet Mercury (circling the Sun in a nearly "closed" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;stationary ellipse, with a small perihelion advance caused by the gravitation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the other planets) and the observed advance of the perihelion (Mercury's</i><br>
<i>&gt;closest approach to the sun), a difference of 43 seconds of arc</i><br>
<i>&gt;(approximately 0.012 of a degree) per century.  (Ritz's, Weber's and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Neumann's theories of gravity as a propagated far-action also give</i><br>
<i>&gt;approximately this result).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The existence of another - intraMercurial - planet, "Vulcan", was</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggested as a cause, but no planet "Vulcan" was found (sorry, fellow "Star</i><br>
<i>&gt;Trek" fans).  However, in 1970, the American astronomer Robert Henry Dicke</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggested a (partial, 10%) classical cause for the anomaly as due to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;oblateness of the Sun (a flattening at the poles caused by rotation).  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;the force of gravitational attraction is only a uniform central force for</i><br>
<i>&gt;orbits lying in the equatorial plane of the sun; Mercury's orbit lies 7</i><br>
<i>&gt;degrees off the plane of the ecliptic.  The sun's equatorial rotation on its</i><br>
<i>&gt;axis is 25.38 days; Mercury circles the Sun in 88 days.  The sun's magnetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;force and atmosphere extends far past Mercury; so does the "solar wind."</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is a rotating accretion disc of particles, gas and dust extending on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the plane of the ecliptic from the sun.  The other planets affect Mercury's</i><br>
<i>&gt;rotation.  Light-pressure from sunlight acts on the planets.</i><br>
<p>
Some quick notes on this last paragraph..<br>
<p>
"Light-pressure", if what you mean is actually the <br>
Poynting-Robertson effect, has effect only on small particles,<br>
ie micron-sized particles.<br>
<p>
Einstein didn't "predict" Mercury's perihelion advance, it was<br>
known. He used his GR to explain it.<br>
<p>
And the dust in our solar system is not really a "rotating accretion<br>
disk of particles." I worte a long essay on dust evolution in the<br>
universe here:<br>

Here's my solar oblateness text.  (Copyright Amara Graps 1997).<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Solar Oblateness<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Introduction.<br>
<p>
One of the big tests for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was<br>
whether a planetary orbit would drift, or precess, when that object was<br>
very close to a large mass. At that point, according to Einstein's<br>
theory, the Newtonian theory of gravitation should fail to obey the<br>
inverse-square law of mutual attraction. The reason the Newtonian theory<br>
of gravitation fails is because the properties of space-time in the<br>
vicinity of the large mass is modified (its magnitude is changed) by the<br>
presence of the gravitational field of the large mass.<br>
<p>
Models/Theories/Controversies.<br>
<p>
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. When it's at perihelion (the<br>
spot in it's orbit closest to Sun), it will be most affected by the<br>
Sun's gravitational attraction according to General Relativity, and<br>
Mercury will never repeat it's orbit exactly -- the position of its<br>
perihelion is no longer constant.<br>
<p>
If one accounts for the gravitational effect of the nearby planets on<br>
Mercury using Newton's gravitational equation, then Mercury's major axis<br>
of its orbit still has 43.03 seconds-of-arc perihelion precession rate<br>
per century that cannot be explained. Einstein, in 1915, showed that his<br>
General Theory of Relativity altered the gravitation equation by just<br>
enough to explain the unexplained portion of the motion of Mercury's<br>
perihelion. The motion of the planet Mercury, was one of the first <br>
successes of Einstein's theory.<br>
<p>
But what if the Sun's shape had an effect on Mercury's perihelion<br>
precession rate? If the Sun were not a perfect sphere, but had an<br>
equatorial bulge (i.e., was "oblate"), that would cause Mercury's orbit<br>
to precess slightly. Then Einstein's Theory would not "neatly"<br>
explain the observations, and modifications to his theory would be<br>
needed.<br>
<p>
How could our Sun be oblate? Rotating gaseous balls should be slightly<br>
oblate, so that the poles of the ball "flatten" and the equator of the<br>
ball "bulges". Astronomers have thought that this simple process should<br>
cause our Sun to be shaped as a (slightly) oblate sphere.<br>
<p>
In 1967,  Robert Dicke proposed the concept of the shape of the Sun as<br>
an oblate sphere affecting Mercury's perihelion precession rate. In fact<br>
at that time, it was already thought that the Sun wasn't a perfect sphere.<br>
But is the Sun oblate "enough" to result in the General Theory of<br>
Relativity not fitting the observations? According to Dicke at that<br>
time, the answer was 'yes'.<br>
<p>
In the 1960s, Dicke and Goldenberg claimed to have detected a much larger<br>
solar equatorial bulge than the solar models predicted. The solar bulge<br>
was large enough to destroy the neat agreement between General<br>
Relativity and Mercury's orbit, but the solar oblateness was not large<br>
enough to permit a Newtonian explanation.<br>
<p>
Dicke presented a scalar-tensor theory of General Relativity, in which<br>
only about 93% of the observed excess rate of perihelion advance could be<br>
explained by relativistic effects (as opposed to Einstein's General<br>
Theory of Relativity, which neatly explains the entire excess perihelion<br>
advance). The remainder could be supplied by the quadrupole moment of<br>
gravitational field which arises due to an oblate shape of the Sun.<br>
<p>
The direct way of measuring oblateness in the Sun is to take the ratio<br>
of the radius of the poles and of the equator. But the measurement is<br>
very difficult because the Sun is a large gaseous ball, so where exactly<br>
is the Sun's limb at these locations? In addition, due to observational<br>
wavelength selection effects, astronomers see higher photospheric layers<br>
towards the limb, an effect called "limb darkening." And the Sun's shape<br>
changes over time, by very tiny (but measurable) amounts. <br>
<p>
Techniques to Investigate the Solar Oblateness<br>
<p>
Solar physicists have created a collection of ingenious methods to measure<br>
the shape of the Sun. For example, one can measure the rotation of the<br>
interior by measuring modes of oscillating sound waves. This method uses<br>
the frequency splittings of the normal (spherical) modes of oscillation<br>
to give a measure of the internal solar rotation.<br>
<p>
Today, using helioseismic instruments, one can also observe the Sun's<br>
limb at the equator and the poles at a sensitivity of 10 feet (i.e. one<br>
can measure gases move by that amount). <br>
<p>
---------------------end of my solar oblateness text   --------<br>
<p>
If you search on keywords "Solar Oblateness" on the NASA ADS abstracts, <br>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/ads_abstracts.html">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/ads_abstracts.html</a>  <br>
<p>
you will turn up hundreds of references from the last 10-20<br>
years. This is something that scientists are interested in, and<br>
working on.<br>
<p>
The following is an abstract from results given at the American Geophysical<br>
Union conference last December 1996 by Jeffrey Kuhn, and some members<br>
of my Stanford Solar Oscillations Group which has a helioseismology<br>
instrument (Michelson Doppler Imager) on the SOHO spacecraft.  <br>
<p>
The result from this work shows that the sun is almost a perfect sphere. <br>
The SoHO/MDI helioseismology instrument found that the Sun's<br>
shape is distorted by only about one mile of its nearly 1 <br>
million-mile diameter.<br>
<p>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
SoHO and the Solar Oscillations Imager Experiment Measure Tiny<br>
Changes in the Shape of the Sun<br>
<p>
Jeffrey R. Kuhn (National Solar Observatory/Michigan State<br>
University), Rock Bush (Stanford), Rick Bogart (Stanford), Luiz Sa<br>
(Stanford), Xania Scheick (Jackson Community College, MI), Phil<br>
Scherrer (Stanford).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the constant environment of space, the SOHO/MDI experiment</i><br>
provides researchers with the longest series of finely detailed<br>
electronic images of the sun we have ever obtained. Because the<br>
spacecraft is above the blurring effects of the atmosphere, and with<br>
the help of sophisticated computer analysis, it is possible to<br>
measure exceedingly small changes in the shape of the sun. These<br>
changes are caused by "oscillations" analogous to terrestrial<br>
earthquakes. Other ground measurements have observed such<br>
oscillations before, but never have we been able to actually detect<br>
the shape of the sun fluctuate because of these sound waves. The<br>
SOHO/MDI experiment is able to detect the edge of the sun move by<br>
about 10 feet. This sensitivity is equivalent to measuring the size<br>
of a quarter placed at the edge of the moon as seen from the surface<br>
of the earth.<br>

I hope this provides some food for thought.<br>
