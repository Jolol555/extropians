<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; animal.  Despite its escape artist skills, it will be much easier to</i><br>

<i>&gt; the oceans from my apartment than, say, an uplifted rabbit or dog.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
With uplifiting, we face some of the same problems we face in dealing with<br>
AI's. One of these similarities is our inability to actually know *WHEN* the<br>
uplift has reached the level of sentience. (I.e., when do we *STOP* the<br>
uplift?) Given that the uplift is likely to be a gradual process, we will<br>
certainly have to find a method of estimating intelligence based on something<br>
other than observed behavior or observed problem-solving ability. I suppose a<br>
marked increase in brain activity/waves may be a clue, but this seems to be a<br>
relatively inelegant, and in the end, inconclusive means of estimating our<br>
success or failure. One concern that would stem from this is that the<br>
newly-created intelligence may not *want* us to know it is intelligent. In such<br>
a case, it is possible that we would have discovered the means to uplift<br>
ourselves, but instead of doing so, we continue iterating our uplift procedures<br>
on the test subjects, and before we realize it, we have uplifted them to be<br>
smarter than we are.<br>
<p>
Maybe this is not probable, but I think finding some way to answer the question<br>
of when we stop the uplift is necessary before we can even begin.<br>
