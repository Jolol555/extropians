I believe it was William Shakespeare who said: "To one who feels, life is a<br>
tragedy. To one who thinks, life is a comedy.<br>
<p>
                                <br>
A fellow came to my door the other day and told me he was from<br>
the IRS and that I owed money. I asked him how much I owed him<br>
and how I came to owe him. He says, "Oh, you don't owe me. You<br>
owe the government." I say, O.K., send in this fellow, govenment,<br>
and maybe he can explain how much I owe and why." He says<br>
govenment is not a man." I say, O.K. send the woman in and she<br>
can tell me." He says, "Government isn't a woman either." I told<br>
him that I don't see how I came to owe a child, but I would<br>
listen if the child wants to explain." He says, "Government isn't<br>
a child  either." <br>
<p>
Trying to clear up the puzzle, I asked, "If government ain't a<br>
man, ain't a woman, ain't a child, who's left to owe?" He then<br>
says that I owe the people. Turns out "people" ain't a person<br>
either, so I ask what it is. He says, "People is everybody." I<br>
ask, "Does it include me." "Yep", he says. Then I say, "You're<br>
saying that I owe myself, but haven't paid myself. Do you reckon<br>
I ought to have myself arrested for treating myself so unfairly?"<br>
<p>
I could see this IRS fellow (IRS - Idiot Representing Self)<br>
wasn't digging the scene at all. He got all agitated and came<br>
full circle and screamed that I still owed the government. I<br>
asked, "Can I take the category, people, for five hundred?" Since<br>
he didn't see any difference in owing the government and owing<br>
the people, he said, "O.K." - Then I sprung it on him. I told him<br>
that last week I got on my ten speed Schwin with a can of WD-40 <br>
and a good tail wind and went to see every last person in the <br>
whole USA. I told him that I asked each and every one if I owed <br>
him\her money. Every last one of them said, "No." <br>
<p>
"Now IRS man", I says, "How is it that 100% of the individuals<br>
say I don't owe, and you take this 100% NO, call these<br>
individuals, "People" and the 100% NO gets flipped over to "Yes?"<br>
I gotta ask, IRS man, do you do card tricks too?"<br>
<p>
Ain't but one thing worse than a man that ain't got no sense. Its<br>
a man who ain't got no sense and ain't got no sense of humor<br>
either. Hey warden, "Can I have another crayon so I can finish<br>
this letter?"<br>
