In a message dated 97-12-16 02:04:18 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Whereas I am restricted to old newspaper reports. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
There you have it....<br>
<p>
The credibility I attach to anything written in the newspaper has diminished<br>
considerably over the last twenty or so years.   I've seen first hand on<br>
numerous ocassions where the journalist (Is that the proper term) was trying<br>
to put forth an "agenda" and wasn't about to let mere facts get in his way.<br>
<p>
Regarding this thread....I'm not too bad of a driver...I have a perfect<br>
record...that is I hae no "Chargeable" accidents on my record.  That doesnt<br>
mean I haven't been involved in wrecks...only that it was later determined<br>
that those wrecks were unpreventable from my standpoint and caused by the<br>
other guy.<br>
<p>
In each case I barely felt the bump...and in each case the other vehicle...a<br>
fourwheeler (automobile) was pretty badly torn up.  No one was hurt in either<br>
instance...luckily...<br>
<p>
I drive an 18 wheeler...not exactly a dumptruck perhaps...but there ARE 18<br>
wheeler belly dumps...and even a ten wheeler probably grosses on the order of<br>
50 to 60 thousand pounds when loaded...That's a whole lot of mass to absorb<br>
the inertial transfer from a puny little 2000 pound passenger car...or a 6<br>
thousand pound one for that matter...<br>
<p>
Regards<br>
