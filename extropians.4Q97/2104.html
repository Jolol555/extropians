I guess I've misunderstood a thing or two for the last months...<br>
The ultimate medium to-date for fast, cheap and, above all, global meme<br>
spreading but that's not what it's for... (?)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Outreach can be accomplished through many other means that we already use,</i><br>
<i> &gt;including the web site (we want to improve it's function in that role),</i><br>
<i> &gt;local meetings and chapters, appearances in the media, and so on.</i><br>
<p>
Most of those are one-way communication, local meetings can be tough with a<br>
couple of hundred persons dispersed accross the four corners of the globe<br>
(never understood that expresion). The beauty of this list is that anyone<br>
can ask a question and get answers from persons who often have more<br>
knowledge and/or a more refined opinion on a subject (or just different,<br>
that can be educational too - trust me, I know ;-).<br>
<p>
Of course there's nothing wrong with having a members-only club for<br>
high-level, civilized, discourse. But the fringe movement of<br>
Transhumanism/Extropianism will then be just that, a fringe movement if<br>
most members only talk to each other in the 'private' room. Fringe, as in:<br>
unknown by the overwhelming majority and therefore often misunderstood and<br>
without much support (financial or otherwise).<br>
<p>
That would be a great loss and waste of many good, constructive idea's.<br>
<p>
We (The_Organisation_Still_Known_As_Excedo ;-) honestly believe that<br>
everything we do must be about meme _spreading_ at this stage, both here in<br>
Europe and everywhere else in the World. How many Transhumanists worldwide<br>
belong to some kind of organisation? 2000? Who would take us seriously? If<br>
we want to be in a position to actively change certain things, like<br>
legalizing cyronics in Holland for instance (from what I hear many<br>
Extropians would like to change a thing or two...), we must have thousands<br>
of members. By constanty being prepared to educate anyone who seeks to<br>
understand, by being as open to criticall questions as we possibly can be<br>
(even if the other party is 'unreasonable' - especially then, in fact).<br>
<p>
I'm using all the "we's" because I feel all will benefit from global<br>
cooperation in some form, no need to reinvent the wheel on every continent.<br>
ExI has already done great stuff, but with only 300 (?) members after 10<br>
years (orso - and yes, I know, Excedo is peanuts even compared to that) a<br>
lot of work remains.<br>
<p>
I would like to have a list were everyone can participate, ExI certainly is<br>
under no obligation to provide such a medium but I think many active<br>
non-members would leave if they cannot particiate. That would mean<br>
breaking-up one of the largest and most active Transhumanist lists in the<br>
world. Those who leave would miss-out on things done on this list and ExI<br>
members would miss-out on other points-of-view (and it is my feeling that<br>
most Extropians are open-minded and interested in other views).<br>
<p>
Personally I would have no problem with paying a fee to ExI but I would<br>
like to have insight in how these funds are being allocated (both<br>
stockholders and taxpayers have that right I believe). Also I would like<br>
specific information on ExI's organisational structure and who is in what<br>
position.<br>
<p>
How about access to the Euro-list Max? Will that remain free and open? Or<br>
should we compensate ExI for the cost of hosting an additional list?<br>
<p>

p.s. <br>
In all honesty I must admit that I'm very curious who the 24 people are<br>
whose posts go to a /dev/null. And on what basis they were selected.<br>
