It looked right to me.<br>

<p>
I don't know what you mean by the "cost" of entropy. Entropy is free, energy <br>
is not, because energy is conserved, entropy is not. I don't want to stop the <br>
growth of entropy, it's possible that entropy will keep on increasing forever <br>
and I certainly hope it does because the only  alternative is the heat death <br>
of the universe. Free energy is related to entropy but if the universe is <br>
open then it's energy any intelligence must be very stingy with if it wants <br>
to survive for long.<br>
<p>
Consider a computer with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The <br>
computer could be in two states, zero and one. Now record something into the  <br>
computer's memory, for example one. You have reduced the states the machine <br>
can be in, from 2 to 1 in this case, and because the entropy of an object is  <br>
the logarithm of the number of ways the parts of an object can be rearranged  <br>
without changing its macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the  <br>
entropy of the machine too. <br>
         <br>
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the  <br>
entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. As Wei Dai pointed out the <br>
absolute minimum energy it takes to erase one bit of information is  ln(2)kT , <br>
k is Boltzmann's constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and T is the temperature of the <br>
computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of energy by everyday standards, <br>
but it is free energy that must be dissipated as heat if you want to erase <br>
one bit of information. One solution to this problem is to keep things very <br>
cold, a better solution is simply don't erase information.<br>
                                       <br>
With reversible  computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the <br>
input, nothing is erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss <br>
and a logical operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is <br>
arbitrarily close to zero. Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that the <br>
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can be made arbitrarily small <br>
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can <br>
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of  time) falls <br>
as the square of the speed. <br>
   <br>
I have thought of a problem with the Black Hole refrigerator idea however. <br>
You're going to have to put your heat radiators pretty close to the event  <br>
horizon because Black Holes are small but they must fill a large part of the <br>
shy. When you get that close the huge gravitational field is going to blue <br>
shift light, including the ubiquitous cosmic microwave background radiation, <br>
except that it wouldn't be microwave radiation anymore, it will be infrared <br>
or beyond.                                          <br>
