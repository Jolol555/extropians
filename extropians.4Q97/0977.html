&lt;SNIP!&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I always maintain that one of the fundamental mistakes that extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists, nanotechnologists, uploaders, AI people, etc make is</i><br>
<i>&gt; grossly underestimating human and brain complexity.</i><br>
<p>
It is complex, but I think it will not be too hard to reproduce it's<br>
PURPOSE.<br>
I don't think I need an AI that thinks it's nervous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  How rapidly could I change red/white cell counts?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If it is controlable enough I could:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A)increase plasma during feeding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; B)increase red cell during exercise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; C)increase white cell during cleansing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a) For plasma volume increase give electrolytes plus colloid.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    There are standard medical plasma expanders available.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; b) For increase red blood cells take testosterone (a slow method)</i><br>
<i>&gt;    or get a direct transfusion of compatible red cells</i><br>
<i>&gt;    or drain you own blood and add plasma expander, this will lower</i><br>
<i>&gt;    hematocrit and cause spleen to empty its red cell reservoir and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to manufacture more, then transfuse own blood back.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Walla! super high hematocrit!</i><br>
<i>&gt; c) I can think of no way to do this at present except by infecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;    yourself with many things which you have previously been vacinnated</i><br>
<i>&gt;    against.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The real question is why would you want to do any of these things?</i><br>
<p>
I want to optimize my body for the actions it is performing.<br>
Efficiency is important to me.<br>
Why eat calories for function I do not want?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Temperature regulation is done directly by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; each cell in response to thyroid hormones and others information</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transmitters</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; all the blood does is even out the temperature from one spot to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; So you are correct that more blood volume could aid in preventing</i><br>
"hot<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spots"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; where additional free radical damage might be increased by the higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperature.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In case you missed my point I will try to explain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Heat is not soley within the cells.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But by far the larger part is generated there.</i><br>
<p>
I want to take the load off the cells so they wear slower,<br>
to make life simple for them.<br>
I what to be their protector, not mearly their keeper.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; As water being rapidly pumped through the system </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disperses warm blood amongst cold blood </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the mean temperature is more easily kept regular(regulated).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True enough as far as I understand you. But it the blood flow is</i><br>
<i>&gt; so fast and the blood volume so large (all 5 liters of your blood</i><br>
<i>&gt; cycled through your body every minute) and the capillaries so close</i><br>
<i>&gt; to every cell, that the body temperature will not vary much from</i><br>
<i>&gt; one point to another as long as you maintain good circulation.</i><br>
<p>
I think that's what I said.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's what I want.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A machine that replentishes the blood supply.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Out with the old, in with the new.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No eating, no drinking, no breathing, no muss, no fuss,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that's the life for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But red blood cells don't have anything to do with food.</i><br>
<p>
I know, <br>
I was talking about replentishing all parts of the blood<br>
(including O as a nutrient, I can't think of a better word).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They only</i><br>
<i>&gt; carry oxygen and transfused one will likely even be difficient of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; You will have to breath even more to reoxygenate them.</i><br>
<p>
Are you telling me their is no possible way to artificially reoxygenate<br>
blood?<br>
<p>
Trying to replace organs is a great way of learning about what they do.<br>
You can look at the body and see what is not being done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You body is already a very efficient and quite optimal life support</i><br>
<i>&gt; system for your brain. Don't you realize that's what its real</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose is?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but I did not know it was designed for that.<br>

<i>&gt; Read the books that I mentioned before. There is no "royal road" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learning. It takes time and hard work.</i><br>
<p>
I can't get books often.:-(<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I see where you are coming from (and trying to get to). I like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that the body is far too complicated physiologically</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; biochemically, and our understanding is far too limited, for anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; what you want to be possible for decades to come.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ERROR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; GIVEN DATA UNACCEPTABLE.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, reality must always be acceptable else you are not all "here".</i><br>
<p>
United Nations'<br>
Universal Declaration of Human Rights<br>
Article 1<br>
All Human beings are endowed with reason.<br>
<p>
I was just implying that the present situation was not good enough.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you searching medline or the Internet? For all searching it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary to be very creative about the terms and names. You need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; think of all possible ways the subject might be expressed.</i><br>
<p>
I consider medline as part of the internet.<br>
It's abstracts often come up in my web searches.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; tongues can be very useful for lots of fun things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn't want to be without one. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would rather not have to worry about any more cells the I have to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I just another mouth to feed.:-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the cells of one part seldom produce free radicals which affect</i><br>
another.<br>
<p>
It makes heat and requires nutrients that coulod be better spent elsewhere<br>
but I probably won't bother to chop it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But you were born too early for what you long to do.</i><br>
<p>
Too late for free love,<br>
too early for free life.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Knowing the general incompetence of governments including the military,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not one who believes that they have any special high tech things</i><br>
<i>&gt; that surpass public science and engineering and no one knows about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This idea is just so much nonsense.</i><br>
<p>
If this were true cutting-edge scientists would often be forced into<br>
silence <br>
in the interest of national security.<br>
I'm not saying it does not happen, <br>
but I hope it doesn't happen that often.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could get better lungs( transplants, biotech implants, bionics).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not for a long time yet. Our natural ones a pretty damned good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Emergency life support systems work pretty well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They last as long as your insurance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are mixed up on what these do and what is essential. When young</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy firemen get burned lungs, they *cannot* be saved. They die!</i><br>
<p>
I do not believe life new saving technologies are beyond today's<br>
capabilities.<br>
All we have to do is get the right people to cooperate with eachother.<br>
Getting O into red cells seems quite easy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Good books are hard to find.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Start with _Harper's Biochemistry_ 24th edition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; White cells use free-rads to help fight germs too( rads not books).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Quite correct. You're not as dumb as you look! :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I wonder if they get out of control.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A bit. No "search and destroy" operation is going to be totally</i><br>
efficient.<br>
<p>
Could white cells eventually be replaced with anti-biotics <br>
or due they perform other functions?<br>
