Occasionally, when other factors weigh larger in determining the plant<br>
site.<br>

Depends. I know of a river in upstate NH that was completely redirected<br>
when it was dammed up because another route would give it a greater<br>
drop  without a long penstock. For a while in the early part of the<br>
century it was one of the largest dammed bodies of water in the world.<br>
Umbagog Lake, Lake Azizcohos, and Moosemeguntic Lake were all treated in<br>
this manner and were three of the largest dammed lakes in the world. The<br>
Volga in Russia was redirected from flowing into the Caspian to provide<br>
water to Siberian wheat farmers.<br>
