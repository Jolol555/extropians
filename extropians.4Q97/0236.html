But how well do they deal with construction (composition?).  In English,<br>
it takes a simple set of prefix and suffix additions to get from<br>
"establish" to "antidisestablishmentarianism" -- how does Chinese handle<br>
such things?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They also survive the centuries better, not</i><br>

<p>
I find it an exceptional advantage to be able to call across the country<br>
or across the ocean and talk to people and understand them.  People today<br>
having a hard time with Shakespeare and Chaucer is more an issue of<br>
general illiteracy and lack of the Chinese reverence for the ancestors<br>
than of phonetic drift.<br>
<p>
As I understand it, each logograph in Chinese is a completely separate<br>
word.  How many of them are there?  I seem to recall a number around<br>
40,000.  English has about 350,000 words.  Consequently, many things<br>
can be said in fewer words in English than in other languages, offsetting<br>
the "fewer penstrokes per Chinese word" that you mention.<br>
<p>
I might be able to to better with this given a lot more time and a<br>
reasonable time of day -- I love language, and while I find it maddening,<br>
I love English, so I hate to let this sort of thing go -- but I need both<br>
to sleep and to get back to work.  I hope this at least adds to the<br>
discussion.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
