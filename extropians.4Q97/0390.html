Just the idea of automated rejection kinda tickles me. I don't have to<br>
feel rude when someone else gets their messages bounced back at them<br>
automatically for being stupid...<br>

<p>
Thats kinda my point. Most people out there still can't agree on where<br>
we are now, so painting a future for them like ours is difficult if they<br>
don't even agree on the hsitorical precursors.<br>

<i>&gt; boss, you authorize millions of dollars in expenditures all the time.</i><br>

<i>&gt; big they are.  Fifty-five cents - now that, I understand!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

My very first job was working at a local farmers market. I got paid<br>
minimum wage, which was $3.25 an hour at that time (big money for a 15<br>
year old in '82). My boss had a sign on his office door that said, "We<br>
would like to pay you what you are worth, but minimum wage laws make us<br>
pay you more..." Needless to say, I got a better job pretty quickly.<br>
