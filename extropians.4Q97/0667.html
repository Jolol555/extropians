In a message dated 97-10-20 20:28:49 EDT, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; Other mammals grow big and strong far faster<br>
 than we do,  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I used to raise hogs...it's been a while..a decade or so...and I forget the<br>
EXACT time periods...but I seem to recall getting two...maybe three litters<br>
of pigs per sow per year...and it took way less than a year for a piglet to<br>
grow to market size....about 180 to 220lbs...from a one to two pound piglet<br>
to a 200 lb market pig...in 6 months to a year...you could almost watch them<br>
grow...all you had to do was shovel the food their way...and clean up after<br>
them...<br>
<p>
Why could that growth rate NOT be acheived under controlled conditions for<br>
brainless clones?<br>
