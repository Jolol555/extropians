This sounds wonderful.  It also brings up something I haven't been able<br>
to get a handle on.  Give thanks to who (or what)?  I fancy myself a <br>
fairly rational sort, but often I feel thankful, in large ways or small.  <br>
For example, if I'm running late and I make it across the railroad tracks <br>
just before the train barrier comes down, I'll sometimes say "Thank you",<br>
and immediately stop and think "Thank who?".  "The universe" is the best<br>
I've been able to do.  But I don't imagine an anthropomorphized universe<br>
giving me favors, and consciously I know it was just chance that I made<br>
it across the tracks, so why doesn't "Oh good!" seem sufficient?<br>
