<i>&gt;    Any evidence you can provide that I am a mystic would be greatly</i><br>

    "Epistemologically there are zero reasons for believing<br>
     a closed universe is even possible."<br>
<p>
Since Rand was quite clear that questions about the nature of<br>
matter and energy were what she called "empirical questions",<br>
properly studied by making observations first, then reasoning<br>
from those observations, your contention that the open vs.<br>
closed universe issue can be decided on introspection alone<br>
amounts to a mystical belief in the God of common sense over<br>
the facts of science.  If there is no reason to believe in the<br>
possibility of a closed universe, there is even less reason to<br>
believe that human introspection not based on measurements can<br>
produce any relevant enlightenment on the subject of cosmology.<br>
Ayn Rand would be ashamed, and as an admirer of the great woman,<br>
I am ashamed.<br>
