Whoops.  Don't know how that junk post went through.  Sorry.<br>

What evidence for an ice age?  The global temperature has increased half<br>
a degree in the past century.<br>
<p>

How can we say that?  There was a happy ecosystem, yes.  There was not a<br>
happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to live near<br>
shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.<br>
<p>
I think we can say that we are busy putting the CO2 of the Carboniferous <br>
back into the atmosphere.  The Carboniferous had Very Large dragonflies<br>
and cockroaches.  Some people might consider this worth a thought.<br>

In the absence of further evidence, I prefer to assume that the<br>
economists are right.  There are various things we should be doing<br>
anyway, which would be cheap insurance.  Not actively subsidizing coal<br>
and other high-carbon fuels.  (Spain and Germany subsidize their coal,<br>
and I suspect the US spent more on the Gulf War than on renewable<br>
energy sources.)  Being more energy efficient in general.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, while global warming is a possible threat,<br>
deforestation, desertification, aquifer depletion, and sperm count<br>
deterioration are all actually happening, as is air pollution in<br>
Mexico City and Beijing which make LA seem like a health spa.  There are<br>
environmental problems with higher urgency.<br>

"Reminds me of a humorous sf story I read a few years back where an <br>
amoeboid alien escaped punishment this way (it was guilty of selling <br>
pornographic pictures to earthly biologists who used them to illustrate<br>
mitosis in their textbooks). Both the resulting individuals claimed <br>
innocence, and pointed out that they were underage."<br>
