Holger Wagner &lt;Holger.Wagner@mail.lrz-muenchen.de&gt; asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where can I find some good information about this (effing etc.)? At</i><br>
<i>&gt; the moment, this doesn't seem quite realistic to me, but I'm willing</i><br>
<i>&gt; to learn :-)</i><br>
<p>
	That's the problem.  This kind of stuff seems so basic to the<br>
philosophy of mind that it is utterly surprising to me that there<br>
isn't more scholarly stuff written about this kind of stuff.  I've<br>
been attempting to write some of this kind of stuff myself but, as you<br>
can probably tell, I'm not much of a writter.<br>
<p>
	I've rewritten my original response bassed on much of the<br>
feedback I've received here.  It contains some more information about<br>
what I'm trying to talk about and hopefully it will answer some more<br>
of your questions.  Let me know if it is any better.<br>
<p>
================================================================<br>
<p>
	There are many forms of the copy paradox idea.  The most<br>
popular deals with the idea of a "transporter" in the Science Fiction<br>
Stories of Star Trek so I'll give what I feel to be the answer to this<br>
issue based on the transporter idea.<br>
<p>
	For discussion purposes, I'll use the names Dup and Trans.<br>
Dup1 walked into a non destructive transporter and walked out of this<br>
same machine unchanged, yet scanned.  Then an identical Dup2 walked<br>
out of the reproducer part some distance away.  Trans1 walked into a<br>
similar scanning machine but was completely taken apart atom by atom<br>
before an identical Trans2 was constructed out of different yet<br>
identical stuff some distance away.<br>
<p>
	It could be likely that if you are Dup1 you will be extremely<br>
annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.  And of<br>
course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even<br>
though Trans2 claims he is the same.  If you were Trans2 you would<br>
have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1<br>
was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported<br>
Trans.  Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the<br>
original Dup and Dup1 would possibly equally annoy you by claiming he<br>
was the real Dup.<br>
<p>
	The primary answer is, if you are the same, you will not be<br>
able to tell the difference between the two, including the particular<br>
feelings and memories being felt by the two now separate copies.  If<br>
you were dup1, you would feel exactly the same as dup2.<br>
<p>
	"Then what is it that is you?" one may ask.  I believe, it is<br>
your state or shape.  If you organized the proper stuff(*1) into this<br>
proper shape it would be you.  Whether it was done a googol years ago,<br>
whether it was done in a googol years from now or whether it was done<br>
in a newly created similar universe different and completely separate<br>
from our own and whether it was done a googol times here today.  (Even<br>
though you may have to be like God to be able to do this or at least<br>
to come up with the complete information required to duplicate someone<br>
that was say cremated 1000 years ago.)  This state of you is self<br>
existent.  This fact about you can't be created by any God nor<br>
destroyed by even the universe ceasing to exist.  It is a logically<br>
necessary fact that you can exist.  Your existence proves this<br>
absoluely.<br>
<p>
	The state of Dup1 and Dup2 would immediately start to diverge<br>
since they would now exist in different locations.  Hence, they would<br>
become more and more different people as time went on.  This would be<br>
similar to the way you are different than the you that existed<br>
yesterday because of your new memories and other changes.<br>
<p>
	One of the primary reasons we are unsatisfied with such an<br>
answer and uncomfortable about being transported and destroyed and<br>
taken apart atom by atom has a lot to do with continuity.  It is<br>
similar to the problem of other minds.  You know what it is like to be<br>
you, but if you look at another person, you don't know for sure that<br>
that person is conscious in any way like you.  As dup1 looks at dup2,<br>
he doesn't really know if that copy is some mindless mechanical zombie<br>
that is merely mimicking his actions and claims to the same identity.<br>
<p>
	These problems exists because actual conscious experience is<br>
"ineffable".  We say that the taste of salt is "ineffable" because you<br>
can't tell someone what salt tastes like, you can only experience the<br>
taste of salt for yourself.  But, since it is ineffable you can't know<br>
for sure if what the other person experiences when he put's salt in<br>
his mouth is the same as your experience.<br>
<p>
	When salt chemicals stimulate our taste buds, this produces a<br>
salty sensation in our brain.  There is a chance that the particular<br>
sensation in one brain is different than the resulting sensation in<br>
another brain.  Salt really isn't "salty" there is just a reliably<br>
correspondence to salt on your taste buds and the resulting salty<br>
qualia that ends up being produced by your brain.  A salty quale<br>
models the chemical salt and it's nutritional value or meaning to us<br>
in a very information and intelligent way.<br>
<p>
	Our consciousness is a collection of all these sensing modes.<br>
We know that a salty quale is not like a honey quale.  We also know<br>
that a salty qualia is not anything like a color quale like red.  Our<br>
brain uses salty to represent sodium chloride and red to represent<br>
700nm electromagnetic radiation.  We even know that a memory of red is<br>
similar, but not anything like real red.  Our consciousness is able<br>
to experience and contrast these sensations.  It knows what they are<br>
each like and knows how they are different.  But, we don't know if<br>
someone else uses these same quale to represent these things because<br>
we can't directly experience what they are experiencing.<br>
<p>
	It is conceivable, however, that this barrier can be crossed.<br>
Just as evolution has added all of our modes of sensing so that our<br>
mind is directly aware of them so that we can compare and contrast<br>
them we will surely some day be able to enhance our brain and add<br>
additional cortexes that experience other sensations.  Once we<br>
discover what qualia are, we should be able to construct scanning<br>
devices that watch particular areas of the brain and determining when,<br>
say, a particular salty sensation is occuring.  This information could<br>
then be transmitted to a brain augmented with a generic qualia<br>
producing device whereupon it produces the identical qualia in the<br>
consciousness of other brain.  I call this "effing".  One my say:<br>
"That isn't what salt tastes like to me!"<br>
<p>
	The key is integrating this additional cortex into the<br>
consciousness just as all our sensing modes are integrated into our<br>
consciousness now.  It is even conceivable that multiple brains could<br>
be merged in this way to produce multiple points of view in the same<br>
mind.  This, of course, would be mind merging.  The single<br>
consciousness would be directly aware of everything going on in both<br>
minds.  It would be able to compare and contrast the sensations and<br>
directly know if they are different or the same.<br>
<p>
	Once we have accomplished such abilities, we will have solved<br>
the problem of other minds, and will have developed a tool to solve<br>
the transporter problem.  Dup1 and dup2 could have their consciousness<br>
connected, either by complete merging, or at least by an effing link<br>
where the same multi brain experiences were being produced in both<br>
minds.<br>
<p>
	It's hard for us to imagine this since the conscious space in<br>
our brain is currently primitively very fixed, non expandable, and has<br>
only one point of view.  So to make it more intuitive, think of the<br>
seeing part of your consciousness being dup1 and the hearing part of<br>
your consciousness being dup2.  Together you can both hear what is<br>
going on in the "to" or copy location and see what is going on in the<br>
"from" or original location but you are, together, one conscious<br>
being.  If the dup1 is to be destroyed, it would be like being<br>
temporarily blinded, but you wouldn't be dead.  You would of course be<br>
able to reproduce the seeing part of your consciousness within dup2<br>
restoring your sight.  Though part of you temporarily died, because of<br>
effing of consciousness all of you would not have died.  This would<br>
mostly solve your intuitive objection to the idea through conscious<br>
continuity.  Of course destruction of any part of you is always a<br>
problem and avoidance of such is always desirable if possible.  But,<br>
if you are consciously spread across multiple platforms, are able to<br>
transfer data and memories between them, you will always know that you<br>
can regenerate the particular part that was destroyed in some other<br>
location or time if necessary or possible.<br>
<p>
	The important part is understanding what of and how our<br>
conscious worlds are made, and then learning how to connect these<br>
conscious worlds so that we can eff feelings, sensations... and share<br>
minds to preserve consciously continuity.  So, once we discover how to<br>
do these things, we will have solved the problem of other minds and<br>
discovered a way to help us feel more comfortable about being<br>
transported.  Our mind is built out of phenomenal qualia and somehow<br>
merged into a unified consciousness.  Continuity of mind, and direct<br>
experience of what others are experiencing are important for these<br>
kinds of problems and indeed for understanding consciousness itself.<br>
Once we discover what qualia are and how they are merged together to<br>
form consciousness, we will finally know what consciousness is.<br>
<p>
(*1) If you insist on something mysterious or ghost like being<br>
included in this "stuff" that you are made of the argument still<br>
applies although at a slightly different level(*2).  If one of you<br>
exists it simply proves it is possible for you to exist.  I think you<br>
could create another identical universe with the same set of souls no<br>
matter what the soul is.  I believe it will be possible to duplicate<br>
whatever it is that is us.  Even if you have to be like God to do it.<br>
<p>
(*2) Unleas of course you believe in some sort of you that is not<br>
duplicatable.  But this is an extremely pessimistic view since if your<br>
not duplicatable then you are probably also not fixable or improvable<br>
and you will forever be stuck with being less than or equal to what<br>
you are today.<br>
