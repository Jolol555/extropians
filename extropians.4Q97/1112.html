  That's my favorite point, Doug.  There will be a network of knowledge servers<br>
collecting experiences, generalizing algorithms, beta-testing them on some robots,<br>
and either downloading them into robots on as-needed basis, or just performing<br>
"remote thinking" for them.  An individual robot would be just a semi-intelligent<br>
and semi-autonomous front-end (sensor and actuator) to the global system, with<br>
some individual adjustments.   People are already working on different aspects<br>
of such systems, as always, without understanding what they are doing.<br>
<p>
  This thought occurred to me about 3 years ago, after reading Moravec's next<br>
book on Mind Age, and I wrote a response to it, starting from the above<br>
considerations, and taking them in a few different directions.<br>
You can find the essay on my website.  <br>
I have more interesting considerations now, but have not written them down,<br>
largely because I do not get much criticism for my papers, so sharing my ideas<br>
doesn't do much to help me advance.  I would be quite happy to discuss this<br>
stuff if you are interested though.<br>
