<i>&gt;Hmmm, now how do we handle topic drift? See, it doesn't stop boneheads</i><br>

Personally I wish people would rewrite the Subject in English if the<br>
subject has indeed shifted.  In general I advocate not getting all involved<br>
in technical supposed solutions like SUBJ CODES that are unnatural for<br>
humans.<br>
<p>
I ignore messages with Subjects under which conversations I'm not interested<br>
have been happening.  If people are too lazy to change the Subject line,<br>
I just assume they have nothing exciting to say.  This isn't necessarily<br>
true but it's shunning behavior and it saves effort on my part.  We have<br>
to develop more contemptuous attitudes toward awkward social-techno hybrids<br>
like email lists.  And contept takes practice!  Skip this post!<br>
<p>
Most threads aren't worth three days of posts anyway.  Think of something<br>
NEW to talk about!<br>
