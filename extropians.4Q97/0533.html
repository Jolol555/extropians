<i>&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky [SMTP:sentience@pobox.com]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whoa!=A0 Microsoft, there, is trading at 60 times earnings.=A0 20 is</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich.=A0 And Microsoft officials keep warning everyone that next =</i><br>
year's<br>
<i>&gt; earnings</i><br>
<i>&gt; will not rise as sharply.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In my opinion, this bull market is a bubble if I ever saw one.=A0 =</i><br>
People<br>
<i>&gt; are</i><br>
<i>&gt; buying a stock in expectation that it will rise, rather than in</i><br>
<i>&gt; expectation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; receiving dividends.=A0 The only way to make money on this stock =</i><br>
market<br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; if</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone else pays an equal amount of money.=A0 In short, it's a =</i><br>
pyramid<br>
<i>&gt; scheme,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not an investment strategy.</i><br>
<p>
Eliezer, this is an interesting analysis, and there's some truth to =<br>
it.=A0<br>
However, both Price/Earning ratios and the overall bull market are more<br>
complex issues than is often conceived.<br>
<p>
First, what level of P/E is healthy depends on the growth rate of the<br>
company in which you're investing.=A0 "Growth" companies with 20% =<br>
annual<br>
profit growth routinely have P/Es of 20-25, as you suggest (even in a<br>
much less bullish market than we have currently).=A0 Microsoft has had<br>
profit growth rates ranging from 35-60% for the past 5 years.=A0<br>
<p>
Yes, every year Microsoft (and Intel and other infotech companies)<br>
inform Wall Street that they cannot maintain this level of revenue<br>
growth indefinitely.=A0 Then in the following year they maintain or =<br>
even<br>
increase their level of growth.=A0 Thus the Street has stopped =<br>
listening.<br>
<p>
I suggest these companies because infotech is still a nascent =<br>
business.=A0<br>
The technology continues to evolve rapidly, and perhaps only 1/10,000th<br>
of the market opportunities have been realized.=A0<br>
<p>
Second, your point about making money off of stock price rather than<br>
dividends is an excellent one that few people realize the significance<br>
of.=A0 What you may be missing is the potential of owning a stock to<br>
realize future dividends at a higher rate.=A0 Ie, I may purchase =<br>
Microsoft<br>
stock now in the interest of making dividends off of it 5 or 10 years<br>
hence.=A0 In this sense a high P/E ratio (and more generally inflated<br>
stock prices as more money flows into the market) reflects longer-range<br>
investing on the part of the public as a whole.=A0 It also reflects a =<br>
high<br>
degree of confidence in future economic growth.=A0 Which I'd expect you =<br>
to<br>
share.<br>
<p>
An awful lot of money has moved into the stock market in the past few<br>
years as interest rates have stayed low and bonds have been shown to be<br>
a less effective long-term investment than stocks (they always were,<br>
even when interest rates were moderate).=A0 Analysts expect an even =<br>
larger<br>
influx over the next 10-20 years as the baby boomers begin to inherit<br>
and invest money from their parents generation.=A0 The larger the =<br>
amount<br>
of money invested in stocks, the higher prices will be overall.<br>
<p>
To be clear, let me add that I think the current market is =<br>
overvalued.=A0<br>
Perhaps by as much as 50%.=A0 A market correction may wipe out a year =<br>
or<br>
more of gains.=A0 Nevertheless, for the investor with a horizon of at<br>
least 5 years, and preferably 10 or more, infotech is a very savory<br>
investment.<br>
<p>
Sadly I'm more or less ignorant of biotech firms.=A0 Could someone post =<br>
a<br>
list of the biotech industry leaders and any analysis of their =<br>
strengths<br>
and weaknesses?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's a pity Zyvex (nanocorp) doesn't take small investors.</i><br>
<p>
Quite a pity indeed.=A0 I'd think that a group of extropians could<br>
collectively pool funds to make a sizable investment.=A0 Would be<br>
interested in communicating with anyone with a serious interest in =<br>
this.<br>
