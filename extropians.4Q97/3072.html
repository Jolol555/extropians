Politeness can be optimistic, as when you assume that a person who is<br>
behaving unreasonably (or even simply disagreeing with you), will behave<br>
more reasonably when treated with patience and dignity.  Politeness can be<br>
pessimistic, as when you assume an irritating situation might devolve into<br>
violence without it.  Politeness is no more an irrational capitulation<br>
than "obeying" gravity is.  Unless you subscribe to the fantastic Randian<br>
assumption that there are no irrational conflicts among people, you will<br>
have to admit the world is peopled with a number of beings at cross<br>
purposes.  There are indefinitely many versions out there of just what<br>
constitutes "plain" "no-bullshit" communication, many of which will<br>
register to others as anything from tedious to outright provocations to<br>
violence.  Civility is a spontaneous order hacked to minimize the<br>
humiliations and discomforts provoked by this plurality of beings and<br>
projects.  I would expect Extropians to champion good manners if only<br>
because in the absence of them people tend to make recourse instead to<br>
litigators and legislators.<br>
