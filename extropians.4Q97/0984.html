I'd be very interested in this. At the moment, the names "Extropianism"<br>
and "Transhumanism" are pretty new to me, and I'm not exactly sure what<br>
exactly the difference is. The way I see it, Transhumanism is probably a<br>
part of Extropianism, but I wouldn't be sure if - for example part of<br>
the Extropian Principles - can be found in Transhumanism,too.<br>
<p>
Would it be correct to say "Extropians are more critical than<br>
Transhumanists"?<br>
<p>
I'm living in Munich, Germany and am currently trying to find a few<br>
people around me who are open to Extropian ideas for discussion - since<br>
next week my vacation will be over (I'm studying<br>
computer-science/engineering and communication studies), I'll probably<br>
have very limited time for that - there's just too much interesting<br>
stuff to learn, and for the next 4 months I'll focus on University ;-)<br>
<p>
later,<br>
