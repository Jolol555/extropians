        Seconded.  When an organization such as this is first started, the<br>
thing it needs more than anything else is connections.  Open doors are far<br>
more inviting than closed ones, and both Max and Tom obviously want the<br>
door open.  However, as Tom iterated in his private posts to Berrie, the<br>
name "Excedo" is too easily associated with Extropy Institute...a<br>
flourishing organization that has been active for a decade.  Even if<br>
~Excedo's intentions for the name have been misunderstood, few can argue<br>
against the similarities in both name and intended ideals.  <br>
        The problem with these similarities have potential drawbacks for<br>
both sides.  For ~Excedo, one of the problems that could be encountered is<br>
one of having to explain to all interested parties that there is truly *no*<br>
association between Extropy and ~Excedo; additionally, if people assume<br>
(without actually knowing) that there is some association, they could have<br>
overly high expectations for ~Excedo.  Perhaps more importantly is the<br>
potential drawback for ExI.  If ~Excedo generates *any* non-extropic ideas<br>
whatsoever (and no-one knows as of yet how extropic ~Excedo's views are),<br>
it could mislead people (through assumptional association) into thinking<br>
that ~Excedo ideals are the same as Extropian ideals.  Overall, the<br>
potential confusion isn't necessary.<br>
