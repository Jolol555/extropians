The "interesting" part is the "extropians-mail-list-as-social-gathering"<br>
thing, Max.  The extropian part is the fact that gun ownership seems to be a<br>
little higher-than-average among extropians.  (Gizmo-freak libertarians,<br>
situated disproportionately in the western U.S.)<br>
<p>
BTW, I have two SKSs.  The first was also Russian, also 1952 vintage, also<br>
virgin; the second an 80s vintage Chinese gun that had seen at least some<br>
service.  Although both are extremely fine weapons, despite the conventional<br>
wisdom, the Chinese gun is more accurate because it has a smoother trigger<br>
mechanism. (I use the Chinese gun for boar hunting.) I recommend removing the<br>
trigger assembly (I'll explain how by private e-mail if you like), soaking it<br>
in gasoline (or other suitable degreaser), thoroughly brushing it out with a<br>
wire brush and then re-lubricating it with a very light machine oil.  This<br>
will take about half of the "clickiness" out of the trigger.  Also, had you<br>
bought your gun two years ago, you'd have paid half as much! Finally, be on<br>
the watch for the occasional "slam fire" double (or more) ignition; if this<br>
happens, keep the damned thing pointed down range and it'll be over before you<br>
can say "oh shit!". (I also have some must-do maintenance tips for you, Anton,<br>
if you've never owned a gas-operated semi-auto, if you'd like them.)<br>
<p>
Be careful and have fun.<br>
