At 06:40 PM 10/2/97 -0700, The Willow wrote of my remark that<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} we set out with a limited if</i><br>
<i>&gt;} Vast immunity repertoire, and the little bastards who breed in us keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;} changing their formula, so the simple passage of time might [zap us]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Considering that we only have</i><br>
<i>&gt;100,000 active genes, as far as anyone can tell, we start out with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather small immunity repertoire.  But lymphocytes -- the antigen</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific white blood cells -- actually have their genes rearranged as</i><br>
<i>&gt;they split from a stem cell, thus making them the only somatic cells</i><br>
<i>&gt;which do not have the same genome as all the other cells. [...] More time</i><br>
to evolve<br>
<i>&gt;is no inherent advantage on the pathogens side.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I was trying to avoid all the messy details.  My key point (borrowing<br>
from William R. Clark's neat little simplified book AT WAR WITHIN, Oxford<br>
UP 1995) is this: the vert immune system is menaced by `a universe of<br>
pathogens that is not only enormous to begin with but full of pathogens<br>
that can alter themselves genetically hundreds of thousands of times faster<br>
than vertebrates can' (263).  (Clark has also written a book, which I<br>
haven't seen, appositely entitled SEX AND THE ORIGINS OF DEATH - anyone<br>
read it?  Opinions?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The entire specific immune system is an excellent example of applied</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, although the term `variation' might be preferable since the<br>
`competeing' units are not put through a selection sieve and do not have<br>
descendants as such.  The genetic deck shuffling in B cells is a truly cool<br>
gadget, with heavy chain and long chain segments built of randomly combined<br>
V, D and J portions, some 300 fragments in the V pool, 12 D and 6 J,<br>
permitting a basic 20,000 different antibody chains.  But because these<br>
segments can be assembled with overlaps, the combinatoire is truly Vast.<br>
Clark again: we thus have a system `for mutating genes that allows you to<br>
create not hundred of *thousands* of new antibodies per *generation*, but<br>
hundreds of *millions*... per hour.  Every hour.  All life long' (265).<br>
<p>
Still, those little critters at the top of the food chain, chewing on us,<br>
do quite often manage to evade the human immune system.  I assume that's<br>
due to their stupendous numbers (permitting each species to try lots more<br>
moves than Deep Blue), their rapid generational turnover, and their own<br>
coat-changing.  Nesse and Williams, 1995, observe with regard to the<br>
latter: `some pathogens alter their exposed molecular structures so rapidly<br>
that the host has difficulty producing newly needed antibodies fast enough.<br>
 This is rapid change without evolution, because the same pathogen genotype<br>
codes for a variety of molecular structures' (EVOLUTION AND HEALING, 63).  <br>
<p>
But I'm open to correction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Homeobox sequences might be conserved not because they get special</i><br>
<i>&gt;repair mechanisms, but because mutants of those genes thoroughly disable</i><br>
<i>&gt;their hosts, possibly killing them in development.</i><br>
<p>
Fair enough.  But I still have this edgy feeling that some DNA volumes in<br>
the library of Babel have better proofreaders than others - that it's not<br>
just a matter of throwing out any completed copy with the title printed<br>
upside down but of intercepting the bloopers in advance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And the whole point is that much DNA is not very highly conserved [...] </i><br>
<i>&gt;That's how we evolved from prokarya.</i><br>
<p>
That's *not* the *whole* point.  It's the most obvious point when the<br>
question is the existence of diversity, but I wanted to direct attention to<br>
the less intuitive islands of stability, and raise the question of how they<br>
managed to remain stationary despite the flux that, incidentally, wears out<br>
our tissues and kills us.<br>
