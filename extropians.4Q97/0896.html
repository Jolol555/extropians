<i>&gt; Are there measurable hormonal levels or other factors which can be</i><br>

<p>
The human growth hormone system is relatively well understood. The<br>
hypothalamus sends GHRF (Growth Hormone Release-Factor) and<br>
Somatostatin (growth hormone inhibiting factor) to the anterior<br>
pituitary (there might be some other chemicals involved here too). The<br>
pituitary gland releases GH, growth hormone (somatropin) which<br>
stimulates growth of various tissues in conjunction with hormones<br>
secreted by the thyroid, the gonads and adrenal cortex. <br>
<p>
It stimulates the productions of several polypeptides called<br>
somatomedins from the liver, which are apparently responsible for most<br>
of the anabolic effects (there are known receptors for somatomedins on<br>
liver cells, fat cells and cartilage cells). <br>
<p>
GH stimulates protein synthesis and the uptake of amino acids<br>
especially in skeletal muscles, while the somatomedins appear to also<br>
act on the muscles and the cartilage at the epiphyses of long bones,<br>
thus influencing bone growth. These hormones have complex effects on<br>
the carbohydrate metabolism, and act together with glucocorticoids to<br>
cause lipolysis (i.e. the decrease of body fat).<br>
<p>
I guess that there are a lot of factors here that could lead to fast<br>
growth and a large adult size, both external factors like diet and<br>
internal factors like the amounts of hormones secreted, how strongly<br>
they affect different cells, the "development program" which<br>
determines the hormonal changes during childhood and puberty and<br>
various obscure interactions with other hormone systems. A lot of this<br>
is likely genetic, if you have (say) genes for more efficient<br>
somatomedin receptors a similar amount of hormones will make you grow<br>
more than another person with normal or less efficient receptors (the<br>
balance of hormones is dynamic, so just increasing the amount of<br>
hormones doesn't necessarily increase the effect, since there are<br>
negative feedback loops in the system).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since we were originally discussing how we could grow human body</i><br>
<i>&gt; parts to adult size in a short period, could we then just manipulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chemical relationships which naturally exist in the body to</i><br>
<i>&gt; encourage a hyper-growth state???</i><br>
<p>
As I have already pointed out, it is unlikely that we could get "hyper<br>
growth" (i.e. growth orders of magnitude faster than normal<br>
development), at least in differentiated tissue. Growing huge amounts<br>
of (say) skin cells or undifferentiated neurons, no problem, but if<br>
you want a functional kidney you need some very elaborate<br>
differentiation to occur which cannot be speeded much since it depends<br>
on the diffusion coefficiencts of various chemicals. But it seems<br>
reasonable to get faster growth by manipulating the hormone levels in<br>
cultured tissues or in people, it is just that it won't be any<br>
miracles.<br>
