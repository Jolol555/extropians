Thank you Lee Daniel Crocker for making a voice that clearly expresses the<br>
larger picture of Gates.<br>
<p>
<p>
Why would we wish death on anyone?  <br>
<p>
In reflecting on Bill Gates and his narrow vision of cryonics, perhaps we<br>
might better view this glitch in his thinking as one that is merely built<br>
upon negations of science's future due to insufficient knowledge.  I see his<br>
comment as an eye-opener.  Cryonicists need to take even stronger action to<br>
make sure that accurate and reliable information about cryonics and science<br>
are portrayed in writings, in lectures, in art and in the media.  How we<br>
present cryonics to informed audiences and non-informed audiences will<br>
reflect on the understanding and acceptance of cryonics.  Gates's comments<br>
make me want to soar even higher and faster to rev-up those who want to live<br>
long lives, those who have the technical skills to help us achieve it, and<br>
also those who need to have their sut-down-valve-on-life-extension opened wide.<br>
