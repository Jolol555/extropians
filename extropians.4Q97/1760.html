<p>
But current humans have goals that are not copasetic.  For instance, Janet<br>
Reno's and the Branch Davidians, Jeremy Rifkin and many of us, Saddam<br>
Hussein... etc. ad nauseam!:)  Is there any reason to believe all sophoctopodes<br>
would coordinate together in a way humans do not?  (This is not a trait of<br>
humans alone.  Chimps have wars too.)  Heck, there are even humans who<br>
believe humanity should cease to exist -- e.g., deep ecologists, religious<br>
fanatics.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Molluscs are different, yeah.  "In the microorganism camp", probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I think the point was that molluscs might be more closely related to us, ergo,<br>
more likely to allign with us.  If relatedness is a key, then they are.<br>
However,<br>
I doubt it is.  In fact, I bet genetic similarity is not helpful at all.<br>
Ideology and<br>
motives will most likely depend on other factors.<br>
<p>
BTW, I believe the rational thing -- what benefits their long range self-<br>
interest -- for sophoctopodes to do would be not to war against humans.<br>
The benefits of sentient diversity benefit them as well as us.<br>
