<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Awhile back I read an article in some magazine that I can't remember -</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; maybe it was a MENSA thing (eep, the M-word!), maybe Popular Science, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't know - but it was on this new concept called Surreal Numbers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Discover Magazine.  "Surreal Numbers."  Forget which issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now,  at the time, I was just learning about _imaginary_ numbers,  so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the thought that numbers could be surreal was something I liked to think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; about from time to time, but never got into - no one could teach me but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; myself.  Anyway,  it seems that some mathematics theorist was coming up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with all these crazy notions about numbers such as infinity + 1, and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; calling them surreal numbers.  Has anyone else heard of such a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is my memory playing tricks on me?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yep.  Surreal numbers are denoted by up and down arrows.  An up arrow with</i><br>
<i>&gt; a dot on top means go up omega times (omega being the set of all integers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Surreal numbers are used to distinguish from different types of</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinities.  For example, the number of integers is obviously different</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the number of real numbers, yet we call them both infinity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, the idea that the number of numbers between 0 and 1 was equal to<br>
the total number of numbers was a bit incomprehenible to me back in<br>
school. Glad to see that there is at least SOME differentiation.<br>
