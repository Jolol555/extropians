<i>&gt; From:          Harvey Newstrom &lt;harv@gate.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 &lt;clip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Extropians are discussing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Wired poll and trying to decide if we are "connected" enough. </i><br>
<p>
The only discussion I have seen that even vaguely matches that <br>
description, was protesting against the definition of the categories <br>
of connectedness in a certain study.  We have several examples of <br>
people who are obviously extremely connected, but don't meet the <br>
definition of "connected" or "super-connected" in that study.<br>
<p>
For that matter, we don't have (so far) any members who claim to be <br>
"connected" or "super-connected".  Just in case anyone wants to speak <br>
up, here are the rules:<br>
<p>
(1) either category must actually get on-line and exchange email at <br>
least three times a week (they don't say if receiving spam counts).<br>
<p>
(2) of the following four technologies: a desktop computer, a laptop <br>
computer, a pager, and a cellular phone, a connected individual must <br>
have three and a super-connected individual must have all four.<br>
<p>
That's the complete definition of those two categories.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People sometimes wonder what computers Extropians use, how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; money we make, what kind of jobs we have, what services we offer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe this could be another Extropian service on the ExI page, polls</i><br>
<i>&gt; showing extropian responses by percentage.  Maybe only paid members</i><br>
<i>&gt; could actually vote, but anybody could read the results.</i><br>
<p>
I am opposed to going to all this work to provide market research (on <br>
ourselves) services to spammers.<br>
