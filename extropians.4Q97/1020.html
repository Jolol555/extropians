In a message dated 97-11-01 03:40:49 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Iron is generally an easily<br>
 alloyed metal, probably due to the fact that it switches crystal structures<br>
 (between BCC, FCC, and HCP) easily under fairly mild conditions.  As for<br>
 amorphous crystals, I don't think metal crystals can be amorphous.  If I am<br>
 not mistaken, amorphous crystals can only occur when there is l &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Ok...that sounds good....except I don't understand it...<br>
<p>
What does BCC, FCD and HCP mean?  And what does Amorphous mean in this<br>
context...<br>
<p>
Addittionally...how would this idea of a crystalline core tie in with the<br>
concept of the  polarity of earths magnetic..."flipping' or reversing every so<br>
often...how would (could) this happen...and what (if any) visible effect would<br>
there be.?<br>
<p>
And just to throw a nother bean into the stew...how does Gold's Primeval Oil<br>
thesis tie into this?<br>
<p>
Enquiring (and non-web connected) minds want to know.<br>
