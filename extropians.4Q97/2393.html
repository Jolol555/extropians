<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I should emphasize that my point was that the absolute price of oil</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the US is lower that it "should" be.</i><br>
<p>
In that case, I must ask you the same question: cite some policies <br>
(and tell us who promoted and enforced them) and explain how they <br>
kept oil prices *lower* than they should be.<br>
<p>
Further, explain how *you* decided what oil prices *should* have <br>
been.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although Michael may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; right that the price was a little bit higher relative to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard US price these days, the fact remains that it never got</i><br>
<i>&gt; even close to the price that it would be in a completely free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market.</i><br>
<p>
I will absolutely agree with that, as *today* there is an <br>
identifiable non-free-market cause of *elevated* prices in the US.  <br>
The commonly admitted significance of this cause is, in this state, <br>
about 30 cents on each gallon of gasoline.<br>
<p>
As a first cut at the first-order, non-admitted significance of this <br>
cause as being at least 15 cents, but probably not more than 45 <br>
cents, out of the price of each gallon.  That is *in* *addition* to <br>
the admitted effects.<br>
<p>
This identifiable cause is: taxes paid directly by the oil industry, <br>
including the payroll taxes of oil-industry employees.<br>
US$500 fee for receipt of unsolicited commercial email. USC 47.5.II.227<br>
