In the Sunday June 8, 1991 issue of the Chicago Tribune on page A16<br>
(continued from A1) an<br>
article called "New Hope for the Paralyzed" by Ronald Kotulak he states:<br>
<p>
    "The first evidence that spinal chord nerves can regenerate across a<br>
big gap was reported last<br>
year by scientists at Sweden's Karolinska Institute.<br>
    "After severing spinal chords in rats, creating a gap about<br>
one-fifth of an inch long, scientists glued<br>
a bridge across the gap using nerves from the animals' chests<br>
    "A year later the rats regained some function of their rear limbs<br>
and made walking  motions<br>
Microscopic examination  revealed that some of the severed spinal chord<br>
neurons had grown over<br>
the bridge and reconnected to the nerves controlling the hind limbs.<br>
    " 'I think this paper shows not only that regeneration is possible<br>
but it also shows that the task will<br>
be easier than we ever anticipated'  [Dr.Wise] Young concluded in an<br>
editorial in the journal<br>
Science. [Dr. Wise Young  is a neuroscientist at New York University<br>
Medical Center]<br>
<p>
Can you locate the citation of the published scientific journal article<br>
that describes this<br>
experiment and its results/conclusions?  Any help would be greatly<br>
appreciated.  I already tried<br>
the CD-ROM version of Medline, an IBIS database search and a MetaCrawler<br>
search.  No luck.<br>
:-(<br>
