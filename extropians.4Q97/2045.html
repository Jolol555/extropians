The question put forward in the Subject line of this posting is not the<br>
right one to ask. Naturally it is in the beginning of discovering the<br>
philosophies that &gt;H &amp; Extropy covers that ones life will be changed.<br>
<p>
After a while when the ideas sink in, it is more like a process of<br>
refinement and personal development.<br>
<p>
Those of us who are old sci-fi buffs, and especially those who have<br>
taken part in &gt;H &amp; Extropy for the last ten years will find it rather<br>
difficult to find ANY posts on any lists that will change their lives.<br>
<p>
Luckily "rather difficult" is not the same as impossible and i have<br>
found lots of mindcandy on this list and continues to do so. My e-mail<br>
filter removes the most noisy participants on the list. (Imo)<br>
