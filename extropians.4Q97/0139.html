Okay, wrong use of tenses.  Let me rephrase:<br>
<p>
To some extent, Microsoft's current dominance derives from their past illegal<br>
and unlawful theft of intellectual property, which was is now protected by<br>
law.  Even if the concept of "intellectual property" is ethically incorrect<br>
and there exists a moral imperative towards its abolishment, current laws<br>
prevent Microsoft competitors from using Microsoft's intellectual property. <br>
Microsoft therefore had an unfair and unlawful advantage, because it had<br>
copied competitors' software while the competitors were prevented by law from<br>
copying Microsoft's.<br>
<p>
Fork on whether "intellectual property" is ethically incorrect.  If it is,<br>
then Microsoft correctly copied its competitors software, but did take<br>
advantage of the U.S. government to impose coercion on those competitors so<br>
that they (the competitors) could not copy Microsoft's software.  If<br>
copyrights and patents are ethically correct, then Microsoft comitted an<br>
ethical violation by copying software.<br>
<p>
End fork.  Microsoft is in violation of Libertarian ethics and U.S. law,<br>
although perhaps not for the same acts.<br>
