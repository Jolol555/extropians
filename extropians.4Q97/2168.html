: At the second level, the reader reads the whole word phonetically.<br>
: This is as far as almost anyone got in the ancient Mediterranean world<br>
: or medieval Europe --people read aloud and literally listened to what<br>
: they were saying.  The ability to read silently was almost unheard of;<br>
: Saint Augustine was famous for being able to read without speaking.<br>

: The third level is where most people end up now.  ...<br>

I, four years old, was reading a book aloud one day when Mom,<br>
tired of listening, said, "You could read quietly."  Wow,<br>
thought I, you're right, I can!  How much more convenient!<br>
<p>
If I could do that within two years of learning what a letter is,<br>
why was it so amazing in the ancient world?  Because letters were<br>
learned (if at all) in adulthood?  Because reading, even for the<br>
literate, was a rare activity?<br>
