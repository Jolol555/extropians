I absolutely agree.<br>
<p>
But *how* to change the way people think? <br>
<p>
To scare them? To lie to them? To tell them guns have demons in them that<br>
make you kill people when you're pissed off in traffic?<br>
<p>
Or to tell the whole truth, and get people "evolved" (bad word:<br>
"post-evolved" might be better) to a point where violent acts aren't their<br>
first resort during a bad-hair day?<br>
<p>
I favor the latter. That means getting everyone rich and calm, AND not<br>
trying to screw each other. Including not lying to each other.<br>
