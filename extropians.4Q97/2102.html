Okay, so what is the purpose of ExI?  What are these "changes" you want to<br>
make?  If members do not have to agree with your political standpoint then<br>
they cannot be political.  So what, exactly, are you talking about when you<br>
mention "changes"?  If you're not trying to make political changes then are<br>
you offering services other than communication with like minded people?  Is<br>
it a support group? a charity even?  The reason I've never joined is because<br>
I have no idea of what it's all about.<br>
