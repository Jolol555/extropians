<p>
mmm, no, because they used the same sign for /me/ as for /mu/;<br>
they ignore vowels like we ignore pitch.  They'd say a true<br>
syllabary, like kana, uses five (or three or eight) signs for /m/.<br>
<p>
Writers in Hebrew, as you may know, later developed an optional system<br>
of vowel marks called "points", which attach to the consonant letters.<br>
Analogous systems are used (but not optionally) in Ethiopic script <br>
(derived from a south Arabic script) and the large Indic family <br>
(not Semitic), not to mention Quenya.<br>

: In which case the true alphabet was actually invented by some Greek(s)<br>
: who adopted the Semitic symbols, realized that none of them coded for<br>
: vowels, fixed that, and thus accidentally created a phonemic alphabet<br>
: whereas left to their own devices they'd probably have created a syllabary.<br>
<p>
Did: Linear B is archaic Greek written in a syllabary.<br>
<p>
: Significance: English uses over a thousand different syllables, but 26<br>
: letters.  We could use a few more, but still fewer than 50.  Syllabaries<br>
: often have 50-75 symbols, meaning their language is restricted to that<br>
: many syllables.<br>
<p>
Well, not really - it's just that if you want to write a more complex<br>
syllable, you have to live with some redundancy and/or ambiguity.  I<br>
imagine that the earliest writing was mainly a mnemonic aid: the reader<br>
already knew generally what the text was about, and so could resolve<br>
ambiguities from context.<br>
<p>
The longest known Linear B text, which I find in a book which I'll cite<br>
in a moment, runs as follows.  On the left I'll put the transliteration, <br>
and on the right somebody's best guess of the intended words.<br>
Note how many consonants are omitted!<br>

"The spelling rules of Linear B allow _e-ri-ta_ [unknown name of a priestess]<br>
to r*Epr*Es*Ent *Eritha, *Eritta, *Erita, *Erintha, *Erista, *Elitha, *Elintha, <br>
or *Elista, *Etc."<br>

: Souce: Lancelot Hogben, _The Mother Tongue_.<br>
: Disclaimer: That's largely my only source; don't take this as expert<br>
: information.<br>
<p>
Hogben is pretty old, no?  Try the _Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language_<br>
or, if you want to spend the bucks (thanks Dad), a recent big book from<br>
Oxford: _The World's Writing Systems_, ed. Daniels &amp; Bright, 1996.  The<br>
above Linear B is from this book, the chapter "Aegean Scripts" by Emmett <br>
L. Bennett.<br>
<p>
Also of interest: Nakanishi, _Writing Systems of the World_ (Chas.E.Tuttle <br>
Co. 1980); where most of the examples for the Oxford book are typeset or<br>
drawn specially, Nakanishi illustrates each major script with a front page<br>
of a newspaper, as well as stamps and the like.  Has some errors in Russian<br>
phonology iirc, which is not surprising in a book translated from Japanese,<br>
but not important.<br>
