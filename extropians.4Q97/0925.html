Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined<br>
with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals<br>
quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by<br>
the improvements in health.<br>

That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is<br>
fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there<br>
are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years<br>
after massive intestinal failure. <br>

<i>&gt; Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately</i><br>
<i>&gt; high altitudes may have increase longevity.</i><br>
<p>
But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,<br>
leading to a similar oxygen saturation? <br>
