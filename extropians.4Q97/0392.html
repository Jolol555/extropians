<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;What I would call instinctive ends are reserved for unreasoning animals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;infants until they reach the mental maturity to calculate in the abstract.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Are you saying that instincts no longer exist when one reaches mental</i><br>
maturity?<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe we need to define the term, instinct, to clarify the question. As</i><br>
<i>&gt;stressed in previous posts, to define is to differentiate. So, by reference</i><br>
<i>&gt;to what and how do we differentiate instinct from non instinct? If instinct</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a natural condition, whatever the instinct is is not subject to dismissal</i><br>
<i>&gt;or alternation by personal preference. One often hears such things as "He</i><br>
<i>&gt;has good instincts for the game." Or, "He instinctively applied the brake."</i><br>
<i>&gt;These things are all developed reflexes, not instincts. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Infant animals, including the human kind, by instinct seek to gain</i><br>
<i>&gt;nourishment necessary for survival. Dogs, cats, etc. are directed by this</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinct all of their lives. I.E., survival instinct. A human individual on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other hand is volitional and at some point in the maturing transition</i><br>
<i>&gt;has the option to choose(within capacity) to survive or choose not survive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Although each individual is made up of characteristics, both common and</i><br>
<i>&gt;individualistic, including the urges you speak of, with the onset of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ability to think in the abstract and make choices, there is no instinctive</i><br>
<i>&gt;directive to determine course of action. </i><br>
<p>
The fact that we are volitional doesn't mean that we no longer have instincts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Somehow, instincts just don't quite fit into the definition of "subjective."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Granted, this is an arguable point. For sake of brevity, I didn't go into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;full explanation of complete differentiation. I don't like the premise,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"automatic values" as it sidesteps choice and subjective and you observe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What we really have in human infants and other animals are REACTIVE</i><br>
<i>&gt;entities. Since the value is attributed by mind, although instinctively, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;source puts it in the subjective realm. That it is automatic, not subject to</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice, puts it in the objective realm. What we have is not a contradiction,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but an evolving transition of one type of animal into another and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;description of each stage as pertains to valuing. </i><br>
<p>
What we have is a bridge across the is/ought gap. Like any bridge, it is<br>
based at both ends. It is both is and ought. It is both subjective and<br>
objective. It impels, but does not compel.<br>
<p>
I simply do not like the<br>
<i>&gt;term valuing in the first stage, but have no single term to represent the</i><br>
<i>&gt;actual differentiation. We also have a situation of valuing as in the case</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a dog with survival instinct, but chooses one type of food over another.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are separate terms needed to make a shortly worded differentiations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Right now I can't find them in the language system and have not tried to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create such terms since this situation is not often discussed. In any event,</i><br>
<i>&gt;considering the non explanatory generality of my statement, your objection</i><br>
<i>&gt;is well warrented. However, when we leave the transition stage and deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt;human adults, the mental action of subjective valuing is quite clear.</i><br>
<p>
Our values do not appear out of nothingness. They are rooted in instincts,<br>
and adapted by volition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;They exist apart from how we feel about them. To be sure, we can control our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;instinctive urges, but we still have them. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These urges you speak of are as you acknowledge at the command of individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;volition as to whether one does or does not act upon them. If we define</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinct as not subject to volition, as was done above, the urges in</i><br>
<i>&gt;question are not in the realm of instinct. This is further evidenced by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that certain beliefs and valutions can psychologically negate all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;survival urges. </i><br>
<p>
If, as you acknowledge, our instinctive urges exist, though we choose to not<br>
be directed by them, why would we define them as not subject to volition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;They seem more like a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*is* which our mind perceives as an *ought*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is a personal *is*. However, the perception of *ought* is rooted in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"impersonal" as it presupposes a course of action and behavior set up and</i><br>
<i>&gt;sanctioned by something other than self. In formal religion, it is called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"God." Apart from formal religion, it may be called anything, or nothing at</i><br>
<i>&gt;all - except the feeling of "ought." The core question is whether the</i><br>
<i>&gt;feeling of "ought" is based on fact or fallacy. In addition to the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"ought" is inconsistent with "is", my long term study of the situation</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaves me with the conclusion that the feeling of "ought" is ALWAYS based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;false beliefs. There is sometimes much difficulty in identifying these false</i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs because they often exist in the subconscious without conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt;awareness of their nature or their effect on thinking and values. Since very</i><br>
<i>&gt;few ever study the principles of mind to understand what they believe and</i><br>
<i>&gt;why they believe it, these subconscious directive beliefs usually go</i><br>
<i>&gt;undetected throughout a lifetime.</i><br>
<p>
Does not the mind perceive instinctive urges as personal oughts? From the<br>
concept of personal ought derived from personal is, comes individual,<br>
internally derived objective morality. Objective morality then, must be<br>
individual, not universal. And it does not come from a superior being. Since<br>
we are volitional, it is our servant, not our master.<br>
It performs an important advisory function.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And be clear what I mean here: I do not wish to test an action; the</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;desire, independent of any action to achieve it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I see it, what Mr. Crocker is saying here is that he does not contest the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that means may be tested (proven as suited or unsuited) in respect of</i><br>
<i>&gt;some end he chooses.  The challenge is to prove the end itself is a valid or</i><br>
<i>&gt;invalid *should* choice. It can't be done because there is no objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;*should*. The theory of objective ought is in direct contradiction of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective fact of individual volition. Do you notice that Mr. Crocker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;statements sets means as subject to proof or disproof? To prove Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crocker's choice of ends as right or wrong, isn't it necessary to regard Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crocker's choice of ends as means to some other end not his own? Even the</i><br>
<i>&gt;words themselves throw out an "ought" as objective. To wit. Objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality IS. To say "ought" is objective is to say objective reality IS and</i><br>
<i>&gt;IS NOT. It just won't fly.</i><br>
<p>
Instinct is both is and ought. I'd say it flies pretty well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;You responded:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should desire species survival, without which we wouldn't be having this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I see your end desire stipulated and implicitly coupled with the wish that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Mr. Crocker attribute  value to the end you name.  What is missing is why he</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;should do so other than to please you. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;To not be in conflict with what is probably his most basic instinctive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;value. To please himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If it were an "instinctive value" it would not be subject to choice, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;it? Wouldn't this mean the value already exists for Mr. Crocker and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"should" has no meaning?   As for pleasing himself, each of us seeks self</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest at all times. Aren't you really presuming to decide Mr. Crocker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice for him? Isn't this a contadiction? </i><br>
<p>
I am assuming Mr. Crocker has species survival as an important instinctive<br>
value. This may, or may not, be the case. Just as you are assuming that he<br>
has an instinctive value of self interest. Whence the value of self<br>
interest, if not instinct? Can such a value be based on whim? Is self<br>
interest, as you imply, universal? To what deity do you attribute this<br>
universality?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Where is recognition of Mr. Crocker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;choice in the matter? The reality is that Mr. Crocker does have a choice and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;to not recognize it, whether it pleases you or not, is not dealing with AS</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;IS, but denial of AS IS, which is to say, denial of the existent, Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Crocker. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;His instincts are a part of him, and yet he cannot change them through his</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;choices, only be in compliance or conflict with them. They are AS IS.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As concluded above, urges are not necessarily instincts as in infants, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;may derived from underlying beliefs. So, there never is the question or</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumstance of being in conflict with instincts since they are by nature</i><br>
<i>&gt;guaranteed. </i><br>
<p>
Goals are derived from premises. Are premises bootstrapped into existance?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;This is literally what every claim of discovered "objective value"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;does. In other words, the concept, objective value, is an illusion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;inherently anti individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Instincts are an AS IS part of the individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;See above. To recap. You acknowledge that one can choose to ignore what</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're calling instincts. Since you can do this by subjective choice,</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't this reveal that what you're calling instincts are not really</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective, nor an objective mandate?</i><br>
<p>
Does the existance of two influences necessitate that one of them does not<br>
exist?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non scientific terms</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality of a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;situation. Having expressed this desire, I remain aware that my end chosen</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;is not the end desire of most. Consequently, I will continue to deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;the real by exposing the fact that ought and should have no connection to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;objective reality except as personal preference and subjective declarations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Are not instincts part of objective reality?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, but the question is, what part, and how does this part relate to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue of values? I know of no instincts of anything that supports the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of should or ought. The belief in "ought" as consistent with objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality, but dependent only upon a subjective feeling leaves all that</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe shouting "ought" at each other without any objective, i.e,, common</i><br>
<i>&gt;frame of reference to peacefully resolve the difference. Believing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"ought" is objective is a psychologial "order" to act upon it. What this</i><br>
<i>&gt;action is and how it is manifested necessarily varies with each individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;One may retreat to a monastery to comtemplate the "spiritual" because he</i><br>
<i>&gt;feels he "ought" to follow this course to please "God." Another may feel</i><br>
<i>&gt;he\she "ought" to kill his\her children because they will be better off in</i><br>
<i>&gt;"heaven". Another may feel he "ought" to devote his life to aiding the ill.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Still another may feel he "ought" to eliminate racial impurity and promote</i><br>
<i>&gt;racial superiority because it is "God's will." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Always is the "ought" tied to something not individual, but felt to exist</i><br>
<i>&gt;and be superior to idividual. Its a short step from "God's will" to "for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;good of the country." Then there is "human rights", "values of society", and</i><br>
<i>&gt;so on expressed or implied as a superior being to which individual is</i><br>
<i>&gt;subordianted giving rise to the "ought." There are those that consciouly</i><br>
<i>&gt;reject the idea of an omni god and "God's will." Some go on to reject</i><br>
<i>&gt;"government" "society" as things of volition and will. Yet, after all this</i><br>
<i>&gt;remains the feeling of "moral ought." Why?  Where does it come from? What</i><br>
<i>&gt;end does it serve in the promotion?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whose end?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The feeling is a residual from a dominant belief in a superior being and</i><br>
<i>&gt;subordination of individual.  It has no name, no face, no conscious</i><br>
recognition.<br>
<i>&gt;It is a haunting specter that emanates from the nearly universal and</i><br>
<i>&gt;saturate philosophy of anti individual. The formal preaching and teaching,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the informal promotion of "divine abstracts", manifested not only in</i><br>
<i>&gt;words, but the entire socio\economic\political system that blankets the</i><br>
<i>&gt;earth, makes no concession to individual as the real. Look and listen. Where</i><br>
<i>&gt;do you see or hear of individual as the absolute real? If I were to tell you</i><br>
<i>&gt;that in your own mind you don't exist; not as the absolute real, not as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncaused cause so to speak, you would probably think I'm nuts, for you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely certain of your individual existence. O.K. Tell me of the source</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the "moral ought" you feel to exist? Do not tell me of your ends and</i><br>
<i>&gt;submit proof of means. This is not the issue. I wish to know of the common,</i><br>
<i>&gt;universal, not individually designated end that must exist to give objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;and definitive meaning to "ought."Can you do this without expressing or</i><br>
<i>&gt;implying a "superior being" in the background as the necessary cause of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"objective value?"</i><br>
<p>
Personal ought is derived from personal is (instinct), giving us personal<br>
objective morality, which impels, but does not compel, because we are<br>
volitional. All of this, being internal, does not rely on a concept of a<br>
superior being.<br>
