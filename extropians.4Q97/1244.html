I gave myself a gift tonight. I saw _Starship Troopers_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the trailers I had seen, I expected to hate it.</i><br>
<p>
I liked it enough to see it again tonight, giving up a chance to attend<br>
an invitational function.<br>
<p>
I think Mr. Heinlein's shade is resting easy tonight. He may even be<br>
smiling.<br>
<p>
Finally a motion picture that bears some small resemblance to a Heinlein<br>
book, all the way through, without running out of budget. Characters<br>
were conflated, many details were elided or simplified.<br>
No, it's not perfect. But it's as far above the movie version of _The<br>
Puppet Masters_ as that was above _Destination Moon_.<br>
<p>
What I especially liked was that the people who made the film added just<br>
enough simple handles that if you hated the book, you'll hate the movie<br>
too. If that's not art, it's at least craft I can respect.<br>
<p>
Joe-Mike says check it out.<br>
