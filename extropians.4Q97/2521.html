Having stood a bit more in uffish thought, I offer a slight reformulation:<br>
<p>
++<br>
<p>
MMB's CREDO RE: UGLY TECHNOLOGIES, Release 1.0 of 97.12.15<br>
<p>
1) It is an observed fact that bullies and fools frequently have use for<br>
weapons--crazy people sometimes use them too.<br>
<p>
2) It _does not therefore follow_ that decent, sane people have _no_ use<br>
for weapons--even ugly ones. This sobers me, but I've come to terms with<br>
it. I am even able to consider the following points relatively coolly:<br>
<p>
3) There is no magic in a uniform, nor a job description, that transforms a<br>
bully, a fool or a crazy person into an honest (let alone decent or sane)<br>
person. Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso and the Divine Right of Kings are<br>
fiction, and that's too bad.<br>
<p>
4) There is no magic in a weapon, nor in commonly available tool-like<br>
technologies--even ugly ones--that transforms a decent, sane person into a<br>
bully, fool, or maniac. Elric's demon-possessed sword is fiction, and thank<br>
heavens for that. <br>
<p>
5) One can imagine other technologies which _can_ perform such a<br>
transformation, and some would argue that they exist today and already are<br>
in use; were such employed, they would make any "menace of firearms"--such<br>
as that decried of late on the floor of the UN, and in US, EC, Japanese and<br>
Downunder media--pale by comparison.<br>
<p>
++<br>
<p>
Special bonus observations:  <br>
<p>
(po) From a certain Bierceian perspective, the aforementioned media are<br>
themselves such a (5) technology. <br>
<p>
(po) Guns don't kill people, _memes_ kill people.<br>
<p>
(po) Desensitization (including simulation) is a time-honored working<br>
method for (_attempting to_) lower the willingness-to-kill threshold of<br>
young testosterone-peaking males. <br>
<p>
(po) What ARE mean ghetto streets, Hollywood revenge-/action shoot-'em-ups<br>
and Duke Nukem _GOOD FOR_?<br>
