<p>
Ahh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe *you* just decided that the<br>
definition was accurate; that it is the consensus definition; the universal<br>
definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's not usually the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremes that are contentious. It's not usually the extremes where most life </i><br>
<i>&gt;situations seem to occur. </i><br>
<p>
Why are the extremes not contentious? Could it be that the vast majority<br>
makes the primethic decision, as it applies to the extremes, and the<br>
contention is in the ambiguous middle?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where we need agreement -- which means, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;we need a workable definition -- is for the middle.  </i><br>
<p>
Indeed. This is the primary purpose of social agreements, to devise a<br>
workable definition for the middle. If it weren't for the ambiguity inherent<br>
in the A/D phenomenon, we wouldn't need agreements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In order for us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;HAVE such agreement, especially for it to be potentially useful in situations</i><br>
<i>&gt;that have not yet happened, we must have a fairly UNambiguous definition.</i><br>
<p>
This is the *purpose* of such agreements. We can't just say, "This is the<br>
definition" and expect everyone else to accept that. We can't just force our<br>
definition on them. That would be an immoral aggression against them, in<br>
violation of our primethic decision and their right to consent. They can't<br>
just force their definitions on us, because that would be an immoral<br>
aggression against us, in violation of their primethic decision and our<br>
right to consent. Thus, the primethic decision establishes the right to<br>
consent, which is a necessary precondition for *any* agreements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A definition that is least clear where most cases will occur is of less </i><br>
<i>&gt;than no utility.  </i><br>
<p>
Hardly. Making the primethic decision, with agreement at the A/D extremes,<br>
means that we respect each others right to enter into agreements, i.e. right<br>
to consent. It provides the starting point for working out the ambiguities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It becomes its own additional source of contention and</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagreement.</i><br>
<p>
It is *the* source of contention and disagreement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What does this all add up to? A/D is clearly distinguishable at it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;extremes and ambiguous in the middle. All of the ambiguity must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;worked out by agreement. For this, we need the right to consent. The right to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consent comes from the primethic decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In unilaterally deciding that defense against aggression, in the human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;context, is moral, and aggression, in the human context, is immoral, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;am claiming the right to consent for myself, and reciprocoly offering the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;same right to all others, with the stipulation that I consider it moral to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defend myself against aggression.</i><br>
<p>
Let's take it a step further. Here is a list of your basic rights:<br>
<p>
1. The right to consent.<br>
<p>
2. See #1.<br>
<p>
3. See #2.<br>
<p>
4. Etc.<br>
<p>
Where do your basic rights come from? The primethic decision. <br>
<p>
All else is by agreement, made possible by the right to consent, i.e. the<br>
primethic decision.<br>
