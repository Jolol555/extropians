 I'm surprised you thought I was dissing you. I didn't mean to. For the<br>
 record, I think you've got what it takes and I was the one who told you I<br>
 wished you could have made it to Extro 3, 'cause you would have had a<br>
 blast.<br>
 <br>
 So chill, Turbo--OK? :)<br>

Awwwwwww....I'm sorry....I got a little carried away with the poetic license<br>
and all...I just saw an oppurtunity to make a point...the frankenstein remark<br>
wasn't intended to be personal...Dr. Frankenstein (as I'm sure you<br>
know)...did scary things with science that the local populance (hairy earred<br>
peasants)...didn't understand and were thus afraid of...and what people are<br>
in fear of they eventually try to destroy...<br>
<p>
I guess my attempt at humor coupled with the desire to make a point via an<br>
analogy backfired...which has happened to me before...and nodoubt will again.<br>
<p>
And I remember the invite...and wish I could have made it..<br>
<p>
Didn't intend it as personal, nor mean to offend...I wa addressing the<br>
idea...not the speaker (you)....I apologize...I'll try to be more clear in<br>
the future.<br>
