<i>&gt;    "If you move straight forward in any direction you will eventually end up</i><br>
<i>&gt; where you started." </i><br>
<i>&gt;    "This universe lasts forever and has infinite volume."</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I just wanted to put your two statements in close proximity so perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could see the foolishness of your argument. Please tell me how I</i><br>
<i>&gt; end up where I started in infinite volume. </i><br>
<p>
Allow me to intervene for Anders here please. I believe that he meant <br>
volume which is infinite in extent.<br>
<p>
And while I'm at it, I might say that while Physicists use <br>
experimentally verifiable equations to explain and solidify feelings and <br>
intuition, Mysticists like yourself use feelings and intuitions to <br>
counter science. My question is which pursuit produces reproduceable <br>
results which can be applied to the betterment of humans?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually, don't bother. Physicists</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been using all sorts of incredible equations to justify and rationalize</i><br>
<i>&gt; their feelings and mystical philosophies from the first day they were able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it would be painful for me to watch a man of your intelligence continue</i><br>
<i>&gt; in this tradition. My hope is that you will research Objectivist Epistemology</i><br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognize it as a powerful immune system for your brain and implement it</i><br>
<i>&gt; so you can go on to apply your admirable mental capacity to challenges that</i><br>
<i>&gt; will increase your happiness(and of course my selfish reasons are to benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from the products or services of a happy, rational person that will be so</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable in a free society--should we ever see a free society on earth.)</i><br>
