    Wether you like it or not, we are under the mercy of nature and the natural world.<br>
Humans may not have any predators, or kill or be killed all the time, but did you ever<br>
stop to think that perhaps this is a bad thing?  I know it sounds very absured, BUT...<br>
nature developed the way it did for a reason, and it has its system of balances.  Ever<br>
stopped to think about what kind of pisition we're really in.  We have no predators.<br>
We've learned how to farm and now have a surplus of food.  We're breaking nature's set<br>
balances, and isn't life grand?  What happens when those checks and balances aren't<br>
there to keep things under control?  Population increase.  With less death, and more<br>
food, the population increases; obvious enough.  Population increases, and demand for<br>
food and living space does too, does it not?  What happens when the worlds population<br>
gets so large that there isn't enough living space and food?  We'll have to end up<br>
destroying critical ecosystems so that we can pile ourselves into their space.  And what<br>
happens when that living space is full?  Predators, and prey are here for a reason.  Our<br>
universe is a universe of opposites. When there is too many of one or the other, things<br>
become unstable, but when there is equal amounts, peace and balance.  Light and dark,<br>
predators and prey, positive charge and negative charge, good and evil.Think about a<br>
virus for a minute.  Similar to something living, a virus' only purpose is basically to<br>
destroy life.  Why did it ever evlove/develope/come to be?  For what purpose?  Maybe a<br>
natural population control.  Ever notice usually when there's a large spread of disease<br>
in nature, it seems to come out of no where, kills of the abudence of animals, and then<br>
is gone again just like that.  Who knows perhaps in that sense guns could be a good<br>
thing, if the population ever gets out of hand, there's bound to be disagreements and<br>
discord, maybe we'll all kill eachother off and things will be all peachy again.  Same<br>
with disease.  We keep finding cures and more lethal and complex diseases arrive.  A<br>
sign maybe?<br>
    Ok I know you're thinking now that I'm way off the subject, and I am. :) Just<br>
thought it was an interesting point to touch upon.  Ever notice it's universally<br>
accepted that basically man was meant to conquer the earth, and that the earth was<br>
almost made for man's triumphs.  We don't even think about it, we just accept it.  Why<br>
live at the mercy of nature when nature can live at the mercy of us?  There are reasons<br>
why.  There are laws to life and balances.  If we don't abide by them, something's bound<br>
to happen.  We keep progressing, and searching for new technology, but to what end? And<br>
for what purpose?  We seem to want to achieve and ultimate standard of living, food for<br>
all, no pain.  But at this rate will we ever get there?  Think of all the cultures we<br>
consider primative.  There are many island cultures, very old, some culutres tens of<br>
thousands of years old.  And the thing is, they have discovered a way of life that works<br>
for them.  They are content, they take what they need, and give back.  They follow the<br>
balance.  Now if they can survive in peace with nature for that long, it's damn amazing<br>
feat.  And when we come and wipe them out with our guns, to take their land and<br>
resources for our expanding population it's actually quite sickening.  That system of<br>
living, all that knowledge, down the drain.<br>
    Heh, well as you can see I'm totally of the subject now, but I'm into this, screw<br>
guns, I have my opinions you have yours.  But now I'd like to hear your opinion on some<br>
of the things I've just stated.  It'd be interesting.  Later.<br>
