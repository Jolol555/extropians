<i>&gt; &gt; I agree. It is important for personal development to experience the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sensual side of life. We are sensual beings, and most of our mental</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well put.  You didn't mention in your message how you take care of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; side of yourself.  Vigorous exercise, music, taking time to enjoy food</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than just eating, ...?</i><br>
<p>
I train ninjutsu, which is both excellent excercise and mentally and<br>
physically useful, and also take long walks when I can (usually I<br>
refrain from taking the bus or train, and simply walk).<br>
<p>
When it comes to music, I try to mix the styles I listen to: most is<br>
classical, some is techno or synth, and some is from various cultures<br>
such as sufi or gregorian chants and japanese drumming. It takes a<br>
while to learn to enjoy new kinds of music, but it is worth it.<br>
<p>
As for food, most of the time I'm fairly conventional, but I really<br>
enjoy trying new kinds of food, and our transhumanist group here<br>
visits one national restaurant each month (I think we are planning to<br>
try Basque food this time; we have already tried the American,<br>
Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Mexican, Italian and Kurd kitchen).<br>
<p>
Another thing I do is to try to perceive things more. There are<br>
wonders everywhere if you look at the tiny details - the textures of<br>
marble, the intricate structure of plants, the patterns formed by<br>
autumn leaves or snow blowing in the wind, the scent trails of fellow<br>
humans or the nuances of sound in a coin falling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;...I play roleplaying games, lecture</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at the young scientist association or a local highschool and discuss</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with my friends. I'm almost the archetypal nerd.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IMHO, roleplaying can offer many valuable vicarious experiences (and </i><br>
<i>&gt; social/emotional interactions as well).  You can bet my characters </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't spend all their time nerding!  There are kidnapped heirs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; saved -- castles to be built -- demons to be slain!  And it has to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done in cooperation with others, and it has to be _done_, not just</i><br>
<i>&gt; argued about (I've lost characters, and entire parties, to being</i><br>
<i>&gt; ambushed, poisoned, buried, etc., because there was too much squabbling</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the next step to take -- remembering this has stood me in good</i><br>
<i>&gt; stead in real life).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, roleplaying is useful, creative and fun! Actually, transhumanist<br>
ideas are much more acceptable to roleplayers, since they are used to<br>
looking at new (possibly imaginary) ideas and trying to see how they<br>
would work. It may turn out that the roleplayers will in the long run<br>
affect our culture more than we expect.<br>
<p>
Yesterday we finished a hard science fiction game. We spent over 6<br>
hours developing a linguistic code with which to communicate with an<br>
alien race, and in the end managed to reach contact and cultural<br>
exchange. My players argued about how to tailor communications to fit<br>
the sensory structure of the aliens, trying to find common ground and<br>
the delicate diplomatic questions of allowing telepresence devices<br>
onboard. It was great fun, and in the end they succeeded in learning<br>
about the alien culture and opening up real human-alien contact (at<br>
the small price of nearly wiping out both species).<br>
<p>
Imagine getting people to seriously think about how sensory<br>
experiences shape our language and philosophy, having a lot of fun!<br>
I'm starting to think this could be used in higher education...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But I'm profoundly happy too....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now *that* is what I like to hear.  I think there are too many bright</i><br>
<i>&gt; (even brilliant) people out there who are angry, bitter, depressed, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and who may not realize at a level they can work with that if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't like feeling that way, they can change it).</i><br>
<p>
That was one realization that really changed my life and made me the<br>
one who I am today. Of course, it is one thing to realize it, and<br>
another thing to actually manage to live by it, but it is possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Balance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't mean that one should devote exactly one third of one's time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; each of these worlds, it means that one should find the right ratios</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to achieve personal satisfaction and development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would add:  and recognize what the ratios are, and not denigrate those </i><br>
<i>&gt; who have chosen different ratios, and acknowledge the value in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quadrants that one has decided to devote less personal attention to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and not let any of them get *too* close to zero, lest the (dynamic)</i><br>
<i>&gt; balance be overtipped.</i><br>
<p>
Some good heuristics there. <br>
<p>
The ratios may change over time; up until this year I did practically<br>
no physical activity voluntarily and believed that I *was* weak, slow<br>
and clumsy. Now I have stepped up my physical side quite a bit, with<br>
noticeable bodily changes and improvements on almost all<br>
aspects. Self-transformation can be very fun!<br>
