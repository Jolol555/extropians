<i>&gt; &gt; On Nightline tonight, they were discussing future technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; including uploading via neuron replacement and evolving AI.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They showed some cool video of what appeared to be evolving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; GAs in a "real" 3D environment. This was the first time I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; seen that, and unfortunately I didn't catch the person's name</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who had done it. Basically they started with a simple organism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; composed of two cubes, and let it evolve into successively</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more complex organisms based on how well they could "swim"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; through the simulated environment. The result looked very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; similiar to a sperm cell :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Very interesting!  One problem with such simulations though is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes they are "cooked" so that a particular outcome is more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitable.  There may be implicit constraints on the types of forms the</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic algorithm can evolve, and the authors will have been careful to</i><br>
<i>&gt; set things up so that a sperm-like shape would be one of the possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; outcomes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Could they take that same simulation, make the fluid thinner (like</i><br>
<i>&gt; air) and change the fitness function to evolve something that flies?</i><br>
<i>&gt; That would be a test of whether they had a good general model of evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; or just a toy.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, later on after that they showed how they changed the<br>
constraints to a "land" environment. They dropped the best<br>
swimmer (the sperm) on it and let it start wiggling. After<br>
many generations they had several good "walkers" evolved,<br>
but they mentioned that many of them were quite different<br>
than what they had expected to end up with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I couldn't help but think about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possibilities should a 3D Cyberspace ever replace the web-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would it become possible to evolve AIs by letting them grow</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and learn within such a system?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Theoretically, other "geometries" for cyberspace would not preclude the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution of AIs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been reading Dan Simmons' science fiction series Hyperion recently.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I can't really recommend it overall because much of it is terribly</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent and sad.)  He has an AI society called the TechnoCore which at</i><br>
<i>&gt; first I assumed was an outgrowth of 21st century AIs.  However later</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the series he claims that it actually evolved out of alife parasites</i><br>
<i>&gt; like our computer viruses and worms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with this idea is that it is hard to see how or why alife</i><br>
<i>&gt; would evolve intelligence.  Current viruses are about as smart as natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; viruses, probably.  And it's not clear how much it would help them to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more intelligent.  If you added today's AI technology into a virus, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; a fuzzy logic based expert system to choose a strategy for infiltrating</i><br>
<i>&gt; a new computer, it would probably not be successful.  The virus would</i><br>
<i>&gt; become so bulky that it would be hard to remain undetected.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe in the future things will change, computers becoming so big and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sloppy that smarter alife can find a niche.  Then it may be possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see a real form of alife evolution where it smartens at least in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological sense, where a bacterium can be considered quite "intelligent"</i><br>
<i>&gt; in its adaption to its environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal</i><br>
<p>
Well, I don't see how a virus could ever do anything unless they<br>
build some sort of genetic algorithm into it that lets it mutate<br>
when it reproduces, or even trade bits with other viruses.<br>
<p>
But if you had a nice Cyberspace that actually created a sort<br>
of real world then things would be interesting. You would have<br>
an environment with light, sound, gravity perhaps, and most<br>
of the other things that we have here on Earth, plus live<br>
people (avatars) interacting inside it and tons and tons of<br>
data (the whole web would presumably be incorporated inside,<br>
plus original content developed for Cyberspace). Now imagine<br>
someone releases some software that allows people to use the<br>
spare cycles on their computers to run an organism inside<br>
Cyberspace, and the organism is allowed to mate with other<br>
people's organisms using various genetic algorithms (perhaps<br>
mutate the algorithms too?), and then the best of the offspring<br>
(best for Cyberspace) is kept. So you could have thousands of<br>
these things running around, and with sufficient algorithms<br>
and time then they should become more and more complex.<br>
<p>
I haven't really thought much about this, but it just seems<br>
that a good Cyberspace would be a much better environment for<br>
this than trying to do it on the web/inet.<br>
