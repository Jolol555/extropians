Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; remarks<br>
<i>&gt;Of course, the most important</i><br>
<i>&gt;question for people to think of is how to be needed. </i><br>
Hmmm Anders, you may well go down in History for that quote ( I hope<br>
its yours :)  )Never before has such an apparently inocous and simple<br>
statement had more momentous implications.  <br>
BTW, this is only my second mail to the list , although I've followed it with<br>
increasing  interest for a while now.  So " Greetings everybody from<br>
Durban, South Africa"<br>
(Yes, the Extropians have finally crept this far South)<br>
