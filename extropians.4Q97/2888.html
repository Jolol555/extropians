I'm sorry, I thought you were debating the substance of my post.<br>
<p>
What I originally posted was:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If this is so, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling us, and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring</i><br>
<i>&gt; your own personal autonomy and freedom.   </i><br>
<p>
After your accusations of illogic, I explained myself:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the aggregate external costs are greater than the aggregate</i><br>
<i>&gt; external benefits, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling us because those costs are not included in the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; production. If guns aren't as inexpensive as the market is telling us,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then before we decide if they are practical we best figure out how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; they *do* cost us. I'm using "practical" in one of its common sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; meanings: "efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose."</i><br>
<p>
This is the extent of my argument, I have gone no further than this. <br>
<p>
Even after this explanation, you are still telling me that I am drawing<br>
a conclusion which does not follow. And you explain why:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You never dealt with any reading of Benefit, either True OR Market.</i><br>
<p>
In my original post I wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A</i><br>
<i>&gt; firearm designed for the express purpose of making killing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient has external benefits only insofar as killing something can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a benefit (rare and isolated situations which constitute a separate</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue).</i><br>
<p>
There is no reason for me to discuss benefit at all because I have only<br>
attempted to show that external costs may exist. If external costs<br>
exist, this means that they must enter our calculations. You will recall<br>
that if aggregate benefits do not outweigh the aggregate costs (I don't<br>
say they do or do not) then guns COST MORE THAN WE THINK. If this little<br>
bit of theory becomes fact, and guns cost more than we think, then that<br>
means that thanks to the existence of external costs, guns may actually<br>
be inefficiently accomplishing their stated purpose.<br>
<p>
Sure, other data is necessary, but I did say "may."<br>
<p>
You continue explaining why I was so illogical:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And</i><br>
<i>&gt; *then* some OPTIMUM came blackwinging in from hypertheticalspace (your</i><br>
<i>&gt; phrase was "most practical") ...as if such a thing could be determined or</i><br>
<i>&gt; was the measure that was being discussed.</i><br>
<p>
You don't like my superlative? Deepest apologies. But don't tell me that<br>
the practicality of firearms is not "the measure being discussed." In<br>
fact, the *ENTIRE* debate up to this point has been about whether<br>
firearms are more trouble than they are worth. We've discussed whether<br>
crime rates increase, we've traded fancy anecdotes about horrible deaths<br>
by handguns, we've traded fancy anecdotes about self-defenses, we've<br>
given numbers of extropians that have guns (as if this is will prove<br>
guns are more extropian), we've lectured and nitpicked.   <br>
<p>
As I said in another post, practicality is "efficiently accomplishing<br>
the stated purpose."  The question this debate has been trying to answer<br>
is whether we should have guns, regulate them, or let them do their<br>
thing without concern. I've attempted to show that they may cost us more<br>
than we think they do. If they cost more than we think they do THEY MAY<br>
ALSO BE INEFFICIENT FOR THEIR STATED PURPOSES. I have chosen, in my<br>
utter disregard for Michael M. Butler's sanity, to use the word<br>
"practical" to convey this concept. <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; AND you never said anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact that without any other data, if all you've determined is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnitude of your expenses is greater than the total of the checks you</i><br>
<i>&gt; registered in your checkbook, you can't tell if you're broke.</i><br>
<p>
I sure did. I said "you MAY be broke." This seems to suggest the proper<br>
measure of nomothetic causal uncertainty. Maybe I should have said<br>
"ceteris paribus" but I mistakenly assumed you might fill in the blank.<br>
Profound apologies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You might as well have said "Since orange juice might be more fairly priced</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher than $1.75 a quart, which is what they charge me down at the store,</i><br>
<i>&gt; orange juice may not be the perfect food."</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; You're totally mischaracterizing me.<br>
<p>
If orange juice costs us more than than we think, it may not be<br>
practical for us to do drink it, no matter how much we like it.<br>
  <br>
If guns cost us more than we think, it may not be practical for us to<br>
make them, no matter how amusing they are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? yourself. : Until you mentioned it, I don't recall anyone talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the "most practical" (the "perfect food").</i><br>
<p>
Again, I apologize for using a superlative. But we are talking about<br>
practicality, whether you like the word itself or not. Are guns<br>
efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't want this to devolve into a kneejerking match, but let me pose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; same question I asked earlier in a slightly different form: what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; external cost of that left-for-dead fifteen year old girl?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It is beyond my ability to assign a monetary value to a human life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Seems to me someone with that limitation would have a hard time evaluating</i><br>
<i>&gt; TrueMarketBenefit and TrueMarketCost, no?</i><br>
<p>
Please point out where in any of my posts I was trying to assign a<br>
dollar value to the two variables you invented above? <br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; For the last time, I'm trying to show that costs may exist that<br>
do not enter the cost of production. I do not care what the dollar value<br>
of these costs are. If they exist, and the age-old economic cost-benefit<br>
balance shows that costs exceed benefits, then guns cost us more than<br>
the market is telling us. If guns cost more than the market is telling<br>
us, then CETERIS PARIBUS they may be inefficient. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm left with only one possible explanation for this misunderstanding: Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; it your impression that one side of (or even _any_ of) the participants in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this specific discussion think that "orange juice is the perfect food" (to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use my analogy)? Did they SAY that anywhere, or is someone doing a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; amateur mindreading here?</i><br>
<p>
Okay, Michael. So now I am not only illogical, I am irrelevant? I have<br>
made a logical argument. And now I must prove that I'm relevant. Fine.<br>
<p>
The very beginning of the first post I made on this subject said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The force doctrine doesn't imply that *firearms* are necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserve freedom. It merely requires that an individual have the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep and bear arms. I agree that this essential point is obvious and</i><br>
<i>&gt; unassailable in light of the Second Amendment. Much of the debate going</i><br>
<i>&gt; on around here concerns whether firearms are a practical means to this</i><br>
end.<br>
<p>
If the purpose of guns is to protect your freedom and they are<br>
inefficient, why not find something else to protect your freedom that is<br>
more efficient? As Lorrey explained, the right to keep and bear arms is<br>
necessary to protect our freedoms and secure power. Great. Fine.<br>
Wonderful. But where does it say that in order to protect our freedoms<br>
and secure power we must necessarily use guns? Why not something else<br>
that might not have the external costs of firemarms?  <br>
 <br>
I've attempted to show that external costs may exist, with all of the<br>
attendant ramifications for efficiency. If I can show guns are<br>
inefficient economically speaking, then I can argue that the right to<br>
keep and bear arms should probably not include guns. If I can show that<br>
external benefits make guns even more efficient, then I can argue that<br>
more guns should be produced. Either way, every argument for or against<br>
gun control implicates practicality. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; _I_ certainly never said that. Who did? Raise your hands, please...</i><br>
<p>
I don't have the time to pull out examples of statements you have made<br>
that implicate practicality.<br>
<p>
