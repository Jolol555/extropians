Mailers are supposed to reply to "From:" unless "Reply-To:" overrides<br>
it.  Many I've seen also have a "group reply" or "replyall" function,<br>
but that sends mail to just about every address listed in the header,<br>
which can snowball.  Being able to easily select only the "To:" address<br>
is not a common ability, I think.  <br>
<p>
Setting "Reply-To:" is a service performed by the mailing list software,<br>
not by any poster manually.  It is thus beyond our power to 'delete' it,<br>
and it is highly convenient anyway.  (Except when people try to reply<br>
privately, whoops!)<br>
