<i>&gt;The concept, morality, is probably the most popular topic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;conversation in the world.  Wherever one turns, one is inundated</i><br>
<i>&gt;by talk of morally right, or moral rights, or the complement,</i><br>
<i>&gt;morally wrong, or immoral, but I don't suppose anyone claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;"immoral rights"; at least, I haven't heard of any doing so. All</i><br>
<i>&gt;in all, there are a lot of words flying about on this subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;with some rather strong emotions often attached. The problem is</i><br>
<i>&gt;this airborne dialogue on "morality" seems to stay airborne,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which puts me to wondering just what the hoopla is all about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What's all the rhetoric attached to? Why do some feel the need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;"justify" their actions? And "justify" by what?  It appears that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Extropian List has its fair share of "moralist", so maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone can help me out on this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I understand cause and effect, that all actions have</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences. I understand that consequences to my liking I call</i><br>
<i>&gt;good, and those I do not like, I call bad.  Does not every</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual do the same?  I hear "morally right" and "morally</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong", but it fits not in my thinking. I can grasp right as</i><br>
<i>&gt;proper means suited to a specific purpose. By the same token, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can grasp wrong means for a specific purpose. But purpose is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter of individual choice is it not? So, is a "moralist" simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;saying that what is suited to his purpose is called moral and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that which is not is called immoral? If not his purpose, whose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or what's? Can we have "good or bad" without purpose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are those that say that what is according to "God's will"</i><br>
<i>&gt;is moral; that which opposes is immoral. Alas, it appears that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"God's will" is a diverse thing and the differences of opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt;follow suspiciously along individual lines. One might say that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is immoral to eat a hot dog while another disagrees, but holds</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it is moral to exterminate all non believers. Thus does</i><br>
<i>&gt;"good and evil" cover a wide "moral and immoral" range" of</i><br>
<i>&gt;differences. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then there are those who consciously and verbally dismiss such</i><br>
<i>&gt;mysticism as "God's will", yet cling no less tenaciously to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;idea of morality than the most devout believers in formal</i><br>
<i>&gt;religion. When pressed for an answer to the question of reference</i><br>
<i>&gt;for claims of moral or immoral, they are at a loss to provide it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some say that which is consistent with life is moral; that which</i><br>
<i>&gt;is inconsistent with life is immoral. This leaves a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;questions unanswered. If one is talking about just bare survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there still remains the question of personal choice. Beyond this,</i><br>
<i>&gt;choices, decisions and actions  comprise an active life. To just</i><br>
<i>&gt;say that "life" is a standard not only denies personal choice,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but totally ignores the elements that make up an ongoing life. To</i><br>
<i>&gt;prepare a list of "moral or immoral" things and attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt;validate such a list is venture that many include in their daily</i><br>
<i>&gt;routine.  Thus by inference do they fall right back into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mysticism of "God's will" and a set of "oughts" for one and all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The "oughts" and "shoulds" fill the air and air seems to be their</i><br>
<i>&gt;only filler, for "ought" is recognition of "not is", and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;twain shall never in reality meet. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The issue can be illuminated by a simple observation and a brief</i><br>
<i>&gt;question or two: The terms, good and bad, have no definitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning except in the evaluation of means in respect of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular end. Suited or unsuited is the question that answers</i><br>
<i>&gt;the question, good or bad. So how does this "morality" stuff get</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the picture?  Is the particular end by individual creating,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or is it a claim of discovery existing independently of</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual creating? If the former, then all individuals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;their ends chosen are no less viable. All arguments of "morality"</i><br>
<i>&gt;are pointless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, if it is claimed the end reference purpose for</i><br>
<i>&gt;"moral" or "immoral" is discovered outside of self or</i><br>
<i>&gt;independently of any individual, whether the alleged source is</i><br>
<i>&gt;called "God", "Nature", whatever,  is immaterial. A purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt;existing independently of individual creating necessarily implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;a volitional source existing independently of individual. Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;the former. </i><br>
<p>
Let me be the first, then. I claim the former.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Although not named and often vehemently denied, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaves the latter, i.e, the concept, superior being, as the root</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "morality."  From the concept, superior being, comes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept, inferior being. This is inevitably followed by</i><br>
<i>&gt;subordination and rule. Since history books and daily newspapers</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell of the horrendous consequences, I need not elaborate here. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To be sure, the idea of the "innate evil of man" in need of</i><br>
<i>&gt;redemption and external control by "non man" is deeply embedded</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the psyche of nearly all. In denial of this belief, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard put to explain the feeling of fear at the thought of leaving</i><br>
<i>&gt;an individual to his choices and own devices. Thus do they pursue "moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;control" for the sake of "security" in a never ending self-</i><br>
<i>&gt;fulfilling prophecy of death and destruction. Do not the facts</i><br>
<i>&gt;bear out this conclusion?  An "unquestionable" sacred idea built</i><br>
<i>&gt;on illusion may be emotionally comforting, but it is often quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;deadly. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I have erred in my deliberations and calculations, please</i><br>
<i>&gt;point out the wheres and whys of the flaws and I shall be</i><br>
<i>&gt;grateful.</i><br>
<p>
As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,<br>
by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future<br>
behavior. <br>
<p>
If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be reasonably<br>
sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the<br>
circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. <br>
<p>
If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of<br>
being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a<br>
commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a<br>
unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all<br>
safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it<br>
very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.<br>
