<i>        &gt;associated profits.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Intel's P/E is less than Cisco's and about half of Microsoft's, in fact it's <br>
not much higher than the average stock, but I think Intel's future is much <br>
brighter than the average company.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I have trouble seeing the PC market growing substantially,</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Well, the vast majority of people on this planet don't have a PC of any sort. <br>
Someday they will.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I see signs that many people are buying lower cost PC's when they do        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;eventually buy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree that under $1000 PC's are becoming more popular, it's because they <br>
can do most of the thing most people want done, or they think they can, <br>
however I don't think lack of demand will be a long term problem for Intel, <br>
so when the stock sold off a few weeks ago I bought some.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't see anything sparking a drive towards P2's by the public,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;either.  Windows 98 will run fine on a Pentium with enough RAM &amp; HD.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Excel, Word, et cetera.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
In the short term I think voice recognition will be Intel's savior,  <br>
especially when it gets integrated with common software, that's gota eat up a <br>
lot of clock cycles. In the longer term the solution is virtual reality, <br>
it never seems to  have enough processing power to make people happy.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;[I don't see] Intel's market share (&gt;90% ?) growing. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I think that in the next 4 or 5 years Intel will dominate not only the <br>
hardware of PCs as it does mow but also of that of workstations, mainframes <br>
and, thanks to the Open MP standard, even super computers. RISC technology is <br>
10 years old now and it's running out of ideas, yes CISC is even older and <br>
dumber, but that's not the point, the point is IA-64. Intel's new IA- 64<br>
architecture really does seem better than anything the RISC people came up <br>
with, and even if it was not, Intel has the critical mass to make it a <br>
standard, something the smaller RISC companies could not do. RISC may be able <br>
to hang on for a while with an inferior technology, just as Intel did with <br>
x86, but they can't survive indefinitely because they don't have the huge<br>
installed base that Intel had.  <br>
<p>
HP, Compaq, Dell, IBM, Bull, NCR, Sequent, Stratus, Hitachi, and Unisys have <br>
all said they will go with IA-64. Digital says they will stand behind their<br>
Alpha chip, but they also say they will make an entire IA-64 line, so despite <br>
what they say I'm skeptical of Digital's commitment to Alpha and I think <br>
potential customers will be skeptical too. Silicon Graphics is singing the <br>
exact same song, but if their MIPS chip is so wonderful why are they making <br>
IA-64 machines, and will they really be willing to match Intel's research and <br>
development dollars to keep MIPS competitive? I doubt it.<br>
<p>
Only pathological Intel (and Microsoft) hater Sun says they will never, ever, <br>
ever, make a IA-64 machine, but they admit they're porting Solaris to IA-64. <br>
Why? Deep down even Sun knows they will have to face reality someday, they <br>
can't fight the entire world.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And now back to lurk mode,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
But not for long I hope, your first post was a very good one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Mark [Somehow lost last name]:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I can't see Intel catching up in the near future unless they build       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;some 3D capabilities into the CPU itself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's exactly what Intel plans to do with MMX2, but probably not until early <br>
1999.<br>
<p>
In the name of honesty I should tell you that I could be wrong, I've been <br>
wrong before, I thought RISC would kill Intel and like a moron sold my Intel <br>
stock 10 years ago.<br>
                 <br>
