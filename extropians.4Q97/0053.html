<i>&gt; &gt;Those who spin the right rhetoric and grease the right palms in</i><br>

Well, we wouldn't think of considering our wives to be our property, but<br>
the original Native American would. Despite the rhetoric of leftists,<br>
and the claims of shamans, it is quite a mixed bag on the Native<br>
American concept of ownership of land and other property. All recognised<br>
a minimum concept that property inhabited and hunted by a tribe belonged<br>
to the tribe as a whole, while others that did not live at such a<br>
subsistence level and were not nomadic did acknowledge more individual<br>
rights. This minimum concept as tribal land was the source of much<br>
conflict among tribes. Less nomadic natives like the Iroquois and the<br>
Algonquin did have established individual property rights that were in<br>
their code of law that was administered by their organized government.<br>
Europeans seem to look to Greece and Rome as the main source of<br>
inspiration for the US model of government, but they are either not<br>
aware of or ignoring the Iroquis Confederation that preceded the US<br>
government by several hundred years, and is strikingly similar in<br>
structure. The Articles of Confederation which preceded the US<br>
Constitution by over a decade are in fact an extremely close translation<br>
of the Iroquis Verbal Law as recorded in the late Iroquis period.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well I don't own a house, but if I did it wouldn't change my belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a lot of cases the land was, in the common definition of theft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; stolen from the American Indians.  That is precisely the gist of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think coercion is subject to as much doubt as you do.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; amongst leftists, but that's because they are so confused about it.;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
However, after all this, I still don't understand why the concept of<br>
implied threat of force as backing for rights of any kind is so<br>
abhorrent. Humans are, after all, carnivores and the top predators on<br>
this planet. It is our nature to be forceful. This is one more in a<br>
never ending chain of examples of how liberals morality diametrically<br>
opposes prosurvival behaviors which have proven their worth for millions<br>
of years.<br>
