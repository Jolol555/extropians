<i>&gt;his flexible use of "objective".  He acknowledged that there isn't some</i><br>
<i>&gt;Platonic realm of Objective Morals, or anything on the level of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumed laws of physics.  He also said that such a result is not very</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting.  Practically, most people do want to live; practically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;most people do want to live in societies; practically, most people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;live in societies do want those societies to work well; and so</i><br>
<i>&gt;observationally most people should follow certain rules in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This isn't "objective" in the sense of physics, or "objective" in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense of "Ayn Rand derived this from a tautology", but it is objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of subjective in the sense that if you want certain things which</i><br>
<i>&gt;almost everyone does in fact want then you can't behave arbitrarily in</i><br>
<i>&gt;all aspects of your life, unless you're far more powerful than them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There's nothing in the laws of physics which codes for life but</i><br>
<i>&gt;practically, chemicals got stirred around; practically, one of them was</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-replicating; observationally, life happened.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} just practical matters to take into consideration consider if you want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;} build a society that works in a certain way, I don't see why they deserve</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;} lofty  title "Objective Morality" any more than a table listing the</i><br>
amount of <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think everyone thinks objective morality is such a lofty term.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectively, if you want to live then you should look both ways when crossing</i><br>
<i>&gt;a street.  Normally we leave off the if clause because nearly everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;does want to live, or at least they don't want to die by being hit by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;random car.  And no one cares, except in esoteric philosophical</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussions like this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd like to note for the record that I used to side with Rich Artym,</i><br>
<i>&gt;arch-subjectivist, until I realized this was all much ado about nothing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rich and I were talking philosophical absolutes; Greg Burch was talking</i><br>
<i>&gt;pragmatic engineering for nearly universal goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} Yet another problem, if "Objective Morality" really is objective then there  </i><br>
<i>&gt;} should be some evidence of it in the non human world but we see none. If you </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, because morality only applies to beings which can (1) affect each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other and (2) communicate with each other.  And then the form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;morality depends on how they can affect each other.  Asteroids don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicate and sheep can't hurt wolves much.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Speaking of wolves, you're wrong.  We do see something like morality in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the non-human world, and wolves among each other are the canonical </i><br>
<i>&gt;example.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There isn't an objective morality keeping a Power from using us as</i><br>
<i>&gt;feedstock.  But if there are multiple Powers, and they hang around each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other for a while, we can predict the range of their behaviors.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective morality.</i><br>
<p>
I would only add that all human beings are at birth totally dependent, which<br>
necessitates a dominant/submissive relationship. As they mature, they become<br>
relatively independent. Among independent peers, a morality of<br>
non-aggression/non-submission (the primethic decision), is what emerges. <br>
<p>
Of course, then we become parents, and are torn between necessity and<br>
morality. :-)<br>
