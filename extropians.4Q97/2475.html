<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Geez, lighten up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, thank you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; My reaction to Anton's posting has more to do with my reasons for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; being on this list rather than the fact that he owns a gun.  I'm here</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to work with others to find the new ways in which humans will move</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; beyond their present state.  I'm looking for the new stories that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be told, and the new technologies that will take us there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; solely for the killing and maiming of other humans relates to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I will listen.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry Kathryn. Guns have been in my family for hundreds of years and not<br>
one has killed anyone. They have killed: bear, wildcat, stone sheep (no<br>
not stoned sheep, that wouldn't be sporting), numerous deer, woodchucks,<br>
rabbits, porcupines, quail, pheasant, grouse, woodcock, geese, and<br>
various ducks. As for self defense, my grandfather once had to defend<br>
himself against a wildcat attack. He had a pit in the side of his chest<br>
for the rest of his life, and a wildcat hide to show for it. Guns are<br>
primarily used as instruments to allow us to fufill our responsibilities<br>
as the top predator. You who live in cities have absolutely no idea what<br>
this statement even means. There are on average 100,000 white tail deer<br>
in the state of NH. WIthout hunters responsibly managing the size of the<br>
herd on an annual basis, the population would quickly skyrocket without<br>
any other predators. This would a) cause a huge die-off in a severe<br>
winter b) cause a skyrocketing accident rate from people hitting deer<br>
with their cars and c) attract more wolves to migrate down from Canada<br>
to the point that when the deer population plummets, in order to find<br>
food, they would be reduced to attacking people.<br>
<p>
The other two purposes: a) to defend ones life and b) to defend ones<br>
liberty, are entirely in keeping with extropian values.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; working towards, anyway?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
We are working towards maximizing human liberty and capability. A gun is<br>
a necessary instrument to defend the individual against statists and<br>
criminals.<br>
