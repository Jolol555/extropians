<i>&gt; &gt; Of course not. you fail to understand the economics of energy</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; stimulated and Carter induced oil crunch of the 70's and 80's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm no admirer of Carter.  IMHO he's the second-best President of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifetime, because he was so incompetent he couldn't get his</i><br>
<i>&gt; horrible ideas implemented -- the best was Reagan because his good</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas got in the way of Congress's horrible ideas, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; retaliation Congress didn't approve his horrible ideas either.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But let's give the, ahem, "credit" where it's due.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It was primarily NIXON that induced the oil crunch of the 70s.  (And</i><br>
<i>&gt; OPEC was more than happy to take advantage of it.)  It was pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; much over before Carter came into office.  As far as I can recall</i><br>
<i>&gt; there really was no oil crunch in the 80s.</i><br>
<p>
Prices remained above $23.00 per barrel for oil until the late 80's<br>
WHile supply may have been high, government policies kept oil prices<br>
higher than they should have been. Sure there were no gas station lines<br>
stretching around the block, but that was more a matter of cars going<br>
from 10 mpg to 25 mpg on average.<br>
