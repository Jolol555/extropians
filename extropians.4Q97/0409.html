<i>&gt; "round world".  It was a concept that you had to grasp conceptually, as well</i><br>

<i>&gt; you do you immediately say "bull" cause its so far out there.  I read that a</i><br>

<i>&gt; flaws.</i><br>

Many of us are rather unconventional people, who would not dream of<br>
putting down something that had actual potential, but we also are mostly<br>
trained well in the scientific method, so we can see holes in theories,<br>
as well as outright flaws. If something cannot be experimentally proven<br>
to work, then it isn't real, and we shouldn't waste our time with it. If<br>
you want to beleive in unproven or disproven things, thats your<br>
prerogative, but it shoulnd't be done on this list. If you want to prove<br>
that something DOES work, then get into the lab and get cracking, and<br>
come talk to us when you've got experimental proof. <br>
<p>
I'm probably the best person to be talking to you about this, as I<br>
showed up on this list 2 years ago with claims about my latest<br>
invention, which is a propulsion device. All I was going on at that<br>
point was data I had developed from a computer simulation I created<br>
based on my designs. I caught a huge ration of absolute crap from a<br>
number of people here who could point to all sorts of "gaping holes" in<br>
my theories, etc... When I was finally able to describe its function<br>
fully to people, those with engineering training acknowledged that it<br>
would produce the phenomenon that I said it would, but that it would<br>
also create opposing forces which would negate its function. So, I shut<br>
up about it, and have been working on building a prototype, which is now<br>
built, and once I get some electric motors in several weeks I can begin<br>
testing and tweaking.<br>
<p>
Of course, if my theories are proven out, I fully expect everyone to<br>
attend a party in my honor at which everyone but me will be served crow<br>
as the main course, after which everyone will try to nominate me for a<br>
nobel prize or something...<br>
<p>
While many of us talk about rather far out theories and technologies,<br>
they are all well grounded in science. There is current research being<br>
conducted and has been conducted. Based upon principles like Moore's<br>
Law, etc. we can make reasonably reliable projections fo what sort of<br>
technologies and performance we can expect to see in the future. At this<br>
point, the with the exception of some natural/traditional medical<br>
practices, the majority of theories and claims falling under the label<br>
"New Age" have already been proven to be absolute garbage through<br>
scientific testing. That many people continue to refuse to be confused<br>
by the facts, and rely on their "feelings", is not our problem nor our<br>
concern, and most of us do not want to be bothered by it. Nor are they<br>
fit subjects for discussion on this list as you will find by reading the<br>
list FAQ. Where we have been descirbed by the press, one recurring<br>
phrase is that we are "rigorously scientific" (which may be compared to<br>
most people, but we are not always compared to most scientists).<br>
