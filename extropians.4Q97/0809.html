[I'm being blocked by some Machine Mind from getting my posts on the net<br>
right now, so this will presumably arrive a little late on the list]<br>

<p>
Hey, let's not forget the original context, people!<br>
<p>
My jab at Wax was in a precisely framed context, namely his use of the<br>
phrase as a stick to beat Mitchell Porter for his imaginative posting,<br>
something that had obviously taken Mitch some minutes to think through and<br>
write when he *could have been out* (Wax implied) doing something more<br>
valuable, or more fun, or less geeky.  <br>
<p>
This is the same Mitch, as list regulars will know, who has just returned<br>
halfway around the world after several weeks of travel up and down the USA,<br>
meeting more interesting people in more diverse places than many people on<br>
this list will encounter in the next year.  *Get out more?*  Wrong target<br>
for (what I read, in context, as) a tiresome jeer.   So when I wrote `I've<br>
always regarded that as...' I meant to imply `in this rhetorical context'.<br>
<p>
Kennita's generic hint that some of us would be well advised to touch each<br>
other more often and smell the roses (mine have just come into bloom, big<br>
and yellow) instead of cowering in front of computer monitors (I've just<br>
got home from a long sunny walk by the creek) is not necessarily insulting.<br>
 It could even be a salutory reminder that there's a complex world beyond<br>
the screen.  But it does skid past the mistaken and rather silly context of<br>
the initial remark.  <br>
<p>
(Do I personally - for what such reflections are worth - *get out more*?<br>
Do I myself  have a life?  A rather more stifled life than I'd wish,<br>
certainly, more constricted than I'd like it to be.  I live alone these<br>
days, but I'm not persuaded  that reading a lot and writing books and<br>
talking with you cyberspace folks, sharing my conjectures and reading and<br>
puns, is an *alternative* to reality.  It's part of reality, perhaps a<br>
redemptive and expansive part.  I don't find many compatible people out<br>
there in the street, or even in the university when I occasionally pedal<br>
over to the campus.  But doesn't the literal narrowness of the e-channel,<br>
its asynchronous theatricality, factor into the appeal of living part of my<br>
life on-line?  Of course.   Does this mean my original reaction to Wax's<br>
cliched jibe was transparently self-defensive?   Gosh, I *never thought of<br>
that*.  [Get a life, Sigmund.])<br>
