That's what I thought you meant, but I wasn't sure.  That's obviously<br>
part of the reason, but you have to admit there's another very obvious<br>
reason: North America is sufficiently isolated (geographically) from<br>
the rest of the world that it's expensive to attack.  That's the same<br>
very simple reason that the continental US hasn't been attacked during<br>
either world war.  The same can be said of Australia.  Simple geography.<br>
<p>
As for our big, well-armed brother to the south?  There is a joke in<br>
the Canadian military.  It goes like this: "Do you know why the<br>
Canada-US border is the longest undefended border in the world?<br>
Because they don't have to, and we couldn't possibly."<br>
