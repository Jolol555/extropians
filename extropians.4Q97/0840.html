In a message dated 97-10-27 03:06:53 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Dear people,<br>
 I'm new to all this talk<br>
 and I have few queries,...<br>
 <br>
 How does one handle 100s of mails<br>
 over a space of 3 days while handling <br>
 a full time job ?<br>
 <br>
 Do you guys do your research and homework<br>
 before publishing stuff like that ?<br>
 <br>
 Does your writings contribute to the <br>
 extropian ideals, and thus creating a<br>
 better world for prospective post-humans ?<br>
 <br>
 Please feedback to me ASAP<br>
 before further disillusionments sets<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
im the one who posted it originally, my apologies, are you new and didnt read<br>
it?  I was referring to a picture i saw of the moon fit snugly inside a<br>
triangle fit snuggly inside the earth, making a perfect relationship, and so<br>
i turned my attention towards this list for my 'research and homework' after<br>
not receiving any replies from two separate astronomers i emailed (still<br>
havent actually), but it turned out to be false, pretty interesting if it<br>
were true though dont you think?  Now the attention has turned to when in the<br>
past this relationship could have existed, since the earth has been<br>
expanding.  We're actually talking about something I dont think anyone else<br>
has talked about before, I think its worthy of discussion. It would be nice<br>
to have that date archived: when WAS the moon in that specific relationship<br>
with the earth?  Maybe it doesnt mean anything if it was, you could go on<br>
forever with relationships between moons and their planets and other moons<br>
and the sun, and im sure some interesting things would come up, and perhaps<br>
they would have some significance, so its good to try and find out.  <br>
