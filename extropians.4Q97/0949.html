I'll ask my cousin this weekend up at our hunting lodge. Crystals do not<br>
need to be one element. Crystals are often formed as matrices of<br>
compounds (one example: silicon based crystals for transistor and diode<br>
components are doped with other elements with different valences to make<br>
emitters and acceptors, Gallium Arsenide is another compound that forms<br>
crystals.) When matter is under sufficient pressure, it will crystalize<br>
no matter what its content. The content and the rapidity of<br>
crystalization will, however, determine the homogeneity of the matrix,<br>
as well as the flaw density. I would imagine that there is a decent<br>
amount of other elements besides iron in the core, but iron will still<br>
be the overwhelmingly largest percentage, and that since the core has<br>
been under the same or similar pressure since the time of planetesimal<br>
formation, its present content would be similar to that at the time of<br>
its original formation, so the "crystal" core could be the most original<br>
structure on earth.<br>
