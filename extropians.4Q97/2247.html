I've just skimmed the article. His objection is not with the thermal noise<br>
(which is adressed by cooling down the device) or positional accuracy<br>
(which is not addressed as easily, for I cannot make a dynamics analysis<br>
as there is no definite manipulator structure yet) but a control problem.<br>
Too many things moving in too many direction over a surrealistic potential<br>
hypersurface while we have coarse handles attached only to a few of them. <br>

"On a length scale of more than one nanometer, the mechanical robot<br>
assembler metaphor envisioned by Drexler almost certainly will work, but<br>
within the 1 nm3 volume surrounding the reaction site there is a subtlety<br>
and complexity that is often not fully appreciated even by practicing<br>
chemists. In any chemical reaction for all but the most trivial of<br>
molecules, the detailed mechanism takes place on a potential energy<br>
surface in an N-dimensional hyperspace, where N is of the order of 10-30<br>
(three dimensions for each atom in the near vicinity of the reaction<br>
site). In order for a robot assembler to be completely universal, it would<br>
have to be able to control the detailed movement of not only the atom(s) <br>
to be added or removed, but also the detailed motion of all the atoms<br>
within a few bond lengths of the reaction site. Unless the motion of all<br>
the atoms is controlled in this reaction nanospace, there is no way of<br>
insuring that only the desired reaction product is obtained. Since the<br>
manipulator "fingers" of the robot would have to be made of atoms as well,<br>
there appears to be at least one fatal problem with the concept of a<br>
universal assembler: there simply is not enough room inside the 1 nm3<br>
reaction volume both for the atoms desired in the final structure and the<br>
atomic fingers necessary to control their movement." <br>
<p>
Merkle says it is not a problem at all, since he has computer models which<br>
prove otherwise. Intuitively, he might be right -- I do not buy the<br>
corrugatedness of the energetic landscape when it cames to rigidly held<br>
radical tools. <br>
<p>
Merkle's newest (afaik) browsable paper can be found<br>

Where I do see problems, is the aforementioned positional accuracy (+- 10<br>
pm should be plenty, but +-100 pm is imo too much), sterical hindrance of<br>
reaction sites on diamondoid terraces, high surface contaminant<br>
concentration at cryogenic UHV conditions and associated radical<br>
lifetimes, sterical hindrance at the tip tool (a hollow tip may be bist),<br>
which would make multiple tip reactions impossible, etc. etc. The possibly<br>
worst problem is the bootstrap problem. We can see Hy Brazeal from here,<br>
right behind the mist bank, but the ocean between us is studded with shark<br>
fins. <br>
<p>
It is a nightmare of seemingly trivial details, but then God is in the<br>
details as John C. uses to say. If one is unwilling to call these<br>
constraints physical laws, one can call them technical difficulties. <br>
Whatever one may call them, if they are severe enough, machine-phase<br>
autoreplicators are dead meat. Or dead diamond. Whatever.<br>
 <br>
