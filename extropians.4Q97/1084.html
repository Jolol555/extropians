<i> &gt; &gt; Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; [the usual tripe...]</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is</i><br>
<i> &gt; it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like</i><br>
<i> &gt; the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?  Why are those</i><br>
<i> &gt; who don't like Microsoft's tacics not using those same tacticts,</i><br>
<i> &gt; since they obviously work?  (And don't give me any bullshit about</i><br>
<i> &gt; how morally upstanding a company Netscape is).  Why do they always</i><br>
<i> &gt; complain simultaneouly that (a) Users must be told to band together</i><br>
<i> &gt; to stop using MS products, and (b) MS products suck?  Obviously,</i><br>
<i> &gt; one of those two must be wrong, because if the products sucked, you</i><br>
<i> &gt; wouldn't have to tell anyone not to use them.</i><br>
<p>
I have the dubious distinction of spending time on Linux based IRC<br>
Channels, where, as you can imagine, anti MS sentiment is rather<br>
Rabid. My comment to all of these people who chide me when I say that<br>
I dont have anything specifically against microsoft, is that I refuse<br>
to bash Microsoft and Bill Gates just because it's cool and hip to do<br>
so. Instead of getting indignant, just dont use their<br>
software. There's almost nothing I do during the course of my day I<br>
cant do with Linux. And the stuff that I cant, I keep a win95 box<br>
around for. (Though it's sorely underused.)<br>
<p>
Their habit of lashing out at MS reminds me of a sitcom I saw many<br>
years ago where a group ofstudents staged a sit-in at their school<br>
(To be socially conscious), but in absence of any real pressing social <br>
ills, they were protesting the replacement of real bacon bits on the<br>
cafeteria salad bar with Baco's. Dont have anything to protest? Make<br>
something up.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called</i><br>
<i> &gt; monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government</i><br>
<i> &gt; will do everything in its power to keep it in power.   And it won't</i><br>
<i> &gt; be because some clueless group of whiners staged a boycott; it will</i><br>
<i> &gt; be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will</i><br>
<i> &gt; have made a better product.  If you want to hasten that day, fine:</i><br>
<i> &gt; don't avoid MS products; just keep buying good ones.  Innovation is</i><br>
<i> &gt; what kills monopolies, and MS has never innovated in its life.</i><br>
<p>
I'll address this in two points. First, not being an Econ expert, I'll <br>
ask the honest question... Is DeBeers not a monopoly? and if so, are<br>
we worse off for it? <br>
<p>
Second, I agree. MS will be split, much like the Baby Bell's. OS,<br>
Apps, and Internet are the obvious splits. Perhaps a divestiture of<br>
mice keyboards and joysticks. The point is, however, while their<br>
so-called monopoly doesnt particularly bother me, they do practice<br>
some rather underhanded methods. THAT is what will limit MS. The DOJ<br>
and FTC, if they successfully hamper Microsoft's ability to illegally<br>
coerce companies, will make them play on a more even field. And quite<br>
frankly they cant compete on products alone.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Someone should go the idea futures exchange and make the following</i><br>
<i> &gt; proposition, so that I can buy shares:</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; "By January 1, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (or the aggregate of all</i><br>
<i> &gt; sub-entities it may have been ordered to split into) will own less</i><br>
<i> &gt; than 50% market share in its product with highest sales."</i><br>
<p>
I'd buy some shares of that. Who picks up the lost market share? A<br>
rejuvenated Novell? Borland? Corel? Their new Video Network Computer<br>
uses Linux as its OS and they own WordPerfect 8. At the risk of<br>
sounding like a blind Linux Zealot (I'm not) I do see the Free<br>
Software movement making huge strides here.<br>

Christopher A. Thompson -    I do not wish it to be misconstrued that at<br>
        ct@x4.net       -      no time was I not in total disagreement.<br>
