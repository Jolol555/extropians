<i>&gt;a very good cryoprotectant solution).</i><br>

Whatever happens, the point is we need a method which will work<br>
well enough to get us better results than current research and<br>
projections.  If things then work out, more funding and effort might<br>
be able to clean up some of these problems.  Genetic algorithmn<br>
searches, e.g., are not perfect, but they are often much better than<br>
brute human engineering or trial and error.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It might be possible that some cps flow into tissue at different rates, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which case, a cp cocktail might be made which can be administered</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the same way current ones are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One could also look at cps or additives that bind more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt;strongly to certain tissues, "opening" or "closing" them for each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other. Sounds complex but interesting (maybe something that opens the</i><br>
<i>&gt;blood brain barrier first?)</i><br>
<p>
Now we're getting somewhere!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps a multistage process might be used in which blood is removed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and cps are injected into the tissues rather than through the main</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; circulatory system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is hard to get better access than the circulatory system - it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;spacefilling fractal.</i><br>
<p>
Not exactly, but close enough.:)  My notion was more like ~pull the blood<br>
out through the circulatory system and perfuse through direct saturation."<br>
This is just one example.  Another might be to inject directly into the<br>
target organ/tissue with a flow and temperature drop rate match so<br>
that the cp works only on that organ/tissue and does not reach others<br>
before vitrification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; (Stanislaw Lem's novel _Fiasco_ has cryonic suspension units inside</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; walkers on Titan, so that if the pilots of the walker wind up in a pinch,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they can suspend themselves.  Early in the novel, there is no way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; revive people, but later on a means develops and one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; preserved persons is revived.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, it is a quite reasonable idea with emergency vitrification. A bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;like an airbag...</i><br>
<p>
Quite.  No reason we can't draw up one for fun.  Maybe someone else<br>
might actually build one.<br>
