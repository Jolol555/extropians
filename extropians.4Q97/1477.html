<i>&gt; What are the qualifications of the creators of Lojban? Computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists, logicians? If they they think that a human mind can process</i><br>
<i>&gt; "language" without nouns, etc., they are profoundly mistaken. Natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; language does not refer to languages which are not concsiously created;</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural language means a language which conforms to Universal Grammar;</i><br>
<i>&gt; this includes created languages such as Esperanto, Ido, Volapuek and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interlingua. Nat.lang. is a category opposed to logical languages such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; predicate calculus or to computer languages. Nouns, verbs, deixis,</i><br>
<i>&gt; anaphor and other such principles are the algorithms and heuristics by</i><br>
<i>&gt; which we make language. Never confuse language with thinking.</i><br>
<p>
JCB and the other Loglanists are mostly linguists, and mostly<br>
pre-Chomsky (which is a plus in my book).  "Universal Grammar" is<br>
the result of some very interesting empirical studies of human<br>
language /as it is/ (the only way it can be empirical), but I do<br>
not for a moment concede that it has anything to say about what /can<br>
be/.  The entire history of human language is a mere pittance of<br>
a few millennia, and the serious study of linguistics a tiny<br>
fraction of that.  To draw any conclusions from such scant evidence<br>
is the height of irresponsible scientific hubris. <br>
<p>
Though the primary motivation of Loglan was to test Sapir-Whorf<br>
effects (for which it still may find some use, despite the<br>
weakness of current forms of the hypothesis), there are many other<br>
practical uses and scientific uses for which it can serve well.<br>
My own advocacy of the language is based on my own study and use;<br>
I claim no credentials in the field, nor do I care what credentials<br>
anyone else may have.  I am not one who takes a such things as<br>
degrees or books sales seriously; I judge the final product, and<br>
for my money, the Lojban group has done about 10 times the valuable<br>
work in linguistics than any modern Chomsky-worshipper I know.<br>
