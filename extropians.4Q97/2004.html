We had this back when the list started.  I was one of the first people to<br>
pay for list access, including a membership in ExI to obtain a cheaper<br>
rate.  (In fact, I paid when Max made a similar pre-announcement, before<br>
they were really ready to accept applications.)<br>
<p>
As I recall, it didn't improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  I believe the<br>
intent at the time was to emphasize ExI's ownership of the list and their<br>
right to control it.  The actual effect, if I recall correctly, was to make<br>
people believe that they had purchased the right to post.  Those who were<br>
told not to post on "forbidden" topics claimed to have been swindled out of<br>
money.<br>
<p>
I don't know if paying for access is a good idea or not.  I do know that it<br>
will change people's attitudes  toward and participation in the list.  I<br>
previously paid for access, and will probably do it again.<br>
<p>
I wasn't around when the list became free again.  What was the reasoning<br>
behind that decision?  Have the motivating factors changed?  I also was not<br>
around when the PPL system of voluntary list-policing was abandoned.  What<br>
happened to the PPL experiment that governed the original list?<br>
