Hi, this is Mizuho from Japan.<br>
<p>
It is difficult for Japanese hospice to have <br>
a suspension facility for now.<br>
"Cryonics" is not so popular in Japan yet.  If a patient <br>
comes to a hospice, learns about cryonics for the first <br>
time, and applies for cryonics, the patient will likely have <br>
problems with his or her family regarding his or her <br>
property.  We therefore cannot offer cryonics to hospices.<br>
<p>
However, the purpose of a hospice is to meet patients' needs <br>
wherever possible, so if a patient has sufficient knowledge <br>
of cryonics and asks for suspension, the staff of hospic<br>
 must grant that request.  <br>
Hospices that understand their duties will cooperate.<br>
<p>
Yoko, a member of Metamorphosis Society, who does volunteer (musical <br>
performance) work at a hospice, has the same viewpoint.<br>
It takes 30 minutes by car from our office to the hospice where she <br>
performs as a volunteer.  When we can afford to have a <br>
suspension facility, we will ask the hospice to cooperate.<br>
