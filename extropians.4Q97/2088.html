Max said:<br>

<i>&gt; Instead, we could leave the Extropians list as it is, and create a new,</i><br>
<i>&gt; additional list, say ExI-Members, or Extropians-Special, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians-Insider (or whatever has the appropriate elitist ring to it :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ). That would leave this list more open, but mean we have a more filtered,</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably higher S/N list, with clear guidelines for members, so we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; still have a new members-only benefit to add to the other membership benefits.</i><br>
<p>
This list is sponsored by ExI itself, yes?  Its going to be the<br>
first place newcomers look, since they will want to see the "main"<br>
list (even though that would not be accurate).  First impressions are<br>
important.  Why not do it the other way?  Make this, the "main",<br>
unhyphenated list members only post, everyone read, and create a<br>
Extropians-Free for All list.  Make the Extropians FfA deliberately<br>
*anything goes*, nothing censored, like the Speaker's Corner in Hyde<br>
Park.  Actively encourage eccentrics to speak out as an expression<br>
of Extropian ideals without seeming to endorse them. That way we can<br>
present a more serious, controlled public face while still providing<br>
a forum for totally unfettered communication. <br>
