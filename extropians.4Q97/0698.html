The topic of attempting to grow body transplant items by using a scaffold<br>
to guide growth was raised by "den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;.  I had read<br>
about experimental work in this area but could not remember an exact<br>
reference. To find a reference (newspaper quality) I used an interesting<br>
web site that allows you to search a large multi-newspaper archive (100 US<br>
newspapers):<br>

In this archive I found a relevant Detroit News article<br>

Scientists rebuilding the body <br>

   In its infancy 20 years ago, tissue engineering was limited to growing<br>
flat sheets of cells. But, except for skin, tissues in the body aren't<br>
organized that way. The breakthrough that is driving the research now is<br>
the ability to grow living cells on a synthetic "scaffolding" that will<br>
dissolve away once the cells are firmly established.  Using this<br>
technique, Boston-area researchers have grown pretty good looking ears and<br>
heart valves. They can also custom tailor replacement cartilage for<br>
functional spinal discs or joint pads. Key to most of the strategies is<br>
the "matrix," a synthetic mini-scaffold on which the cells attach<br>
themselves and grow. Mooney and many others are using scaffolding<br>
materials based on dissolvable surgical sutures. They're man-made, but<br>
they degrade into natural materials found in the body and are easily<br>
carried away by the blood stream. By altering the mix of suture materials<br>
used in the scaffolding, they can control the rate of its break down "from<br>
weeks to years," Mooney said. <br>
<p>
end excerpt<br>
<p>
Other techniques are discussed, e.g., methods for arteries.  Consider this<br>
excerpt regarding cells in the pancreas. <br>
<p>
Begin excerpt<br>
<p>
Scientists treating diabetes have made tiny porous beads of degradable<br>
material that contain replacement "islets," the cells of the pancreas that<br>
secrete insulin. The holes in the beads are small enough for nutrients and<br>
oxygen to flow into the islet cells and for the insulin and waste products<br>
from the cells to flow out. But the holes are too small for immune system<br>
components like antibodies or white blood cells to get at the foreign<br>
islets and kill them.<br>
<p>
The islet cells, which come from pigs or cows, eventually die on their<br>
own, and the capsules dissolve, so a re-injection is needed a couple of<br>
times a year, but the system delivers insulin only as needed, the way the<br>
body's own system would.<br>
<p>
End excerpt<br>
<p>
Here it seems possible that using tissue obtained by cloning would be<br>
desirable because the threat of rejection by the immune system is<br>
nullified and the cells may last much longer.<br>
<p>
A natural idea I think is the following:<br>
<p>
Initiate a clone and then by a process of selecting subsets of cells and<br>
placing the cells in appropriate chemical micro-environments (i.e., with<br>
the proper chemical concentration gradients)  cause the cells to<br>
differentiate into needed cells. <br>
<p>
Islets cells would be a good example of needed cells for diabetics. <br>
Another example of needed cells would be spinal column nerves which are<br>
still somewhat immature and capable of growth. Some individuals who are<br>
paralyzed because of spinal column injuries have a gap between nerve<br>
endings of bundles in the spinal column.  Imagine placing these cells in<br>
the gap and setting up a chemical gradient so that the cells grow across<br>
the gap and reconnect the spinal nerves.  Proper physical rehabilitation<br>
may allow these individuals to use their full body again. <br>
