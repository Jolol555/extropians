<i>&gt; Holger Wagner &lt;Holger.Wagner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt; writes(that's me :-)):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1) Today, humans are by no means perfect. They have a certain idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what they do and what the consequences are, but it happens quite often</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that something "impredictable" happens. If you apply changes to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ecologic system, can you really predict what consequences this will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the long run - and would you take the responsibility?</i><br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; replied:<br>
<i>&gt; We cannot predict the long-term consequences of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions. Period.</i><br>
<p>
Is that a proven fact? I mean: will it NEVER be possible, even with<br>
superintelligence?<br>
<p>
Maybe short-term predictions will be sufficient as we gain more control<br>
over nature. What about simulating ecologic, economic, social etc.<br>
systems? Today, we may not have enough computing power (and probably not<br>
the right theories and algorithms, either), but wouldn't this be a very<br>
valuable field for research?<br>
I came across this when I learned about different theories and models<br>
(please correct me if those terms don't make any sense to you) for mass<br>
communication. There were simple models that were easy to understand but<br>
that could only be applied to simple problems, and there were<br>
complicated models which were hard to understand but which could explain<br>
a lot more. I believe one could think of models that don't make sense to<br>
humans because they can't deal with them in their brains - but computers<br>
can.<br>
<p>
My idea was to give the computer a program that can deal with as much<br>
data as available, start a simulation and see how similar the results in<br>
the simulation are to those in reality. That'll give you a basis to<br>
improve.<br>
<p>
Since we're probably soon (or already) gonna deal with technology that<br>
*might* mess up great parts of our environment, simulations for certain<br>
steps (including worst-case scenarios) could trouble (trouble sounds<br>
like quite a bizarre word in that context). One thing I have in mind are<br>
genetically manipulated insects, or even worse - bacteria, which<br>
accidentally (or intentionally) come into the environment. This could<br>
cause (currently) uncontrollable chain-reactions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Possible solution: I assume that most scientists are very intelligent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a scientist, I'm flattered but unfortunately this isn't very true</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in fact it is a remain of the old romatic idea that artists and</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists are set apart; in reality scientists are fairly ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; people in general).</i><br>
<p>
I guess I expressed myself pretty humbly...<br>
I didn't mean to generalize it like that.<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2) Today, humans are by no means perfect. While I trust scientists to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have at least a vague idea of what they're doing, I do not trust people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in general.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks again, but I think you should nuance your position a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; more.</i><br>
<p>
You're right - you misunderstood me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think one can trust all people (with a few exceptions) to some</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent; being a scientist doesn't per se make you more trustworthy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as being a government official doesn't per se make you less</i><br>
<i>&gt; trustworthy.</i><br>
<p>
Trusting people is an interesting subject of its own - I should have<br>
stressed the "to have at least a vague idea of what they're doing". In<br>
fact, a simple worker might know a lot better what he's doing than a<br>
scientist working on some complicated matter.<br>
The problem is when people who don't understand innovations (and the<br>
possible risks), try to gain whatever advantage from them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Solution: Educate people accordingly. (easy to say - but I don't believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it's possible until I see world-wide results).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is actually the solution to many other problems, like poverty and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the spread of some bad memes.</i><br>
<p>
I've been thinking about the "education" problem today. I believe that<br>
education is the ONLY thing I'd be willing to pay taxes for. Good<br>
education should be freely available to all human beings. I don't care<br>
if a "government" or another company takes care of that, but it has to<br>
be done much better than today!<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But what if there comes a day where we have to face an insane fool who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has the technology to wipe out all life on this planet? Someone who just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't understand or just doesn't care about the responsibility?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a real problem, since even if we solve the problems you</i><br>
<i>&gt; discuss, there may always be somebody who is deranged or clumsy enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; to mess things up. Even without sociopaths and zealots there will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; accidents and people who do dangerous things for good reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The solution is likely to empower people in general, so that it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be hard for dictators, fanatics and error to overcome</i><br>
<i>&gt; all. Unfortunately this only works if the technologies are not of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind that the first use wins (this was the cause of our major</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology debate a few months back; was nanotech inherently such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a technology, or could even deliberate nasty nanodevices be</i><br>
<i>&gt; contained?). In this case dispersal seems to be the only strategy.</i><br>
<p>
I missed that one... maybe I should look it up in the archives?<br>
