Danny, Danny, Danny.  Calm down.  We're on the same side.<br>
<p>
Once more slowly:<br>
<p>
What should I _do_?<br>
<p>
When you find out what they're trying to tell us so that we can do it or<br>
otherwise respond to it, and/or when you have the address of the<br>
"build-the-alien-engine" foundation so we can send donations or investment<br>
dollars or go work for it, please let us know.<br>
<p>
Danny, whether or not aliens built crop circles is about as interesting<br>
to me as whether the Mayans or the Incas built some particular burial<br>
mound, unless the fact dictates a particular course of action.<br>
<p>
How do I get sucked into discussions like this?  I guess it's because I<br>
think (hope?) that people will take what I'm saying to heart eventually.<br>
<p>
Would people please cease trying to prove to Danny that his ideas are<br>
wrong?  Does it matter that much to you one way or the other?<br>
<p>
<p>
Enough.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Kennita (feeling like a live vaccine, and hoping to immunize while<br>
causing as light a rash as possible)<br>
