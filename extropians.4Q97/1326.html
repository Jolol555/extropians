<i>&gt; &gt; He is specifically challenging us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to come up with a critique of tech.  What is the extropian critique</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have an incredibly simplistic view of the future: we either embrace</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology, or we die. The reason is simple: population. There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; known non-technical way to stop the population from growing, so</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, there are a great many plausable scenarios in which technlogical</i><br>
<i>&gt; change has detremental effects, but it's the only game in town. Live</i><br>
<p>
Points well made. To Steve's point, this is a good over arching<br>
statement. But it doesn't have any depth.<br>
<p>
Tech like all lead based pipes are a rather bad idea (but good for<br>
population control).<br>
<p>
Not all ideas are so clearly bad.<br>
<p>
And some ideas have some subtly. Large Nuke based reactors clustered<br>
together are a bad idea. Small passive cooled nuke reactors based in<br>
local towns and neighborhoods are a great idea.<br>
<p>
We can accept tech  -- That's the first step!<br>
<p>
The 2nd step is to find the best tech and the best approaches and to<br>
find out the ideas that seem great (like lead pipes) but aren't once you<br>
get additional knowledge (e.g., lead is a poison).<br>
