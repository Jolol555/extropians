<i>&gt;&gt; Study Suggests Brain May Affect Religious Response</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; From a Times Staff Writer</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; New Oreleans- No one knows why humanity felt its first religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stirrings, but researchers at UC San Diego reported Tuesday that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; human brain may be hard-wired to hear the voice of heaven, in what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; researchers said was the first effort to directly address the neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; basis of religious expression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In a provocative experiment with patients suffering from an unusual form</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of epilepsy, researcher determined that parts of the brain's temporal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lobe - which the scientists quickly dubbed the "God module"- may affect</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; how intensely a person responds to religious beliefs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; They emphasized that their findings do not suggest religion is simply a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; matter of brain chemistry. "These studies do not in any way negate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; validity of religious experience or God," the team cautioned.</i><br>

   IAN: I believe that the mystical experience -- the perceptual <br>
   identification with infinite being -- is a product of a neuro-<br>
   logical condition, and thus initiating that neurological con-<br>
   diton would faithfully initiate the mystical experience. <br>
<p>
   But it does not follow therefore that the mystical experience <br>
   is false; which is to say, if the experience of infinite being <br>
   is derived from neurological conditions, it does not necessarily <br>
   mean that there is not an infinite being to which we are unified, <br>
   which remains hidden under normal neurological conditions. <br>
<p>
   All states of mind resulting in various conclusions about the <br>
   nature of reality are the product of various neurological con-<br>
   ditions. If X is false simply because it's a neurological con-<br>
   dition, then all conclusions about reality, being the result <br>
   of neurological conditions, must also be false.<br>
<p>
<p>
   WHICH PERCEPTION IS MOST TRUE?<br>
<p>
   It stands to reason that some neurological conditions and the <br>
   conclusions about reality derived therefrom are more accurate <br>
   than others. How do we determine which conclusions are more <br>
   accurate? We could choose to believe whichever we like most, <br>
   but the most reasonable measure would be that X is most accurate, <br>
   or true, where X adheres most consistently with physical facts <br>
   that all or most perceptual beings can mutually experience, <br>
   even under different neurological conditions.<br>
<p>
   Most logical positivists would agree with that standard, and <br>
   most would therefore assume that it would push the mystical <br>
   experience out of contention for any degree of accuracy, much<br>
   less that of being "most accurate." I believe that that assup-<br>
   tion is, however, false and that I have proven it to be false.<br>
<p>
   The mystical experience states, as it were, that "I am all <br>
   things, all space, and all time," the experience of which is <br>
   said to be union with  God, or "yoga." How could this be true? <br>
   The relational nature of identity: A thing, A, is A only as <br>
   derived from the relation of A and not-A. The identity of <br>
   A IS this relation and this relation is not in either A or<br>
   not-A, the relation is nonlocal; therefore, ispo facto: <br>
   I am all things, all space, and all time.<br>
<p>

<p>
   The mystical experience is a cleansing of the doors of<br>
   perception, as Huxley put it. As the source of less-than-<br>
   the-full-truth -- of the perception that I am limited -- <br>
   is the brain, it follows logically that the remedy to <br>
   this illusion would also arise from the brain, and <br>
   specifically from the cessation of its normal function. <br>
<p>
<p>
   AN ANALOGY<br>
<p>
   If a radio is so loud you cannot hear anything except it, <br>
   to hear the reality beyond the radio requires modulation <br>
   of the radio. But it does not follow that the auditory <br>
   reality beyond the radio discovered after modulating the <br>
   radio comes from the radio simply because it is discovered <br>
   by modulation of the radio. So too, simply because the <br>
   "mystical reality" is discovered after modulating the <br>
   brain, it does not follow that it comes from the brain,<br>
   i.e., that it is a reality isolated to the brain.<br>
<p>
   Think of the brain as the radio: the normal neurological<br>
   traffic, or noise, is so loud it drowns out the reality<br>
   beyond it. Neurological modulation causing the mystical <br>
   experience to arise, typically prolonged mediation, I <br>
   believe, turns down the "brain noise," thereby allowing <br>
   the perception of the reality beyond the brain noise.<br>
   <br>
   No wonder that that experience is associated with the<br>
   cessation of mental dialog, or noise. It is an experience<br>
   beyond all play words, and as such is, I believe, the <br>
   real and true experience: being is eternal and free.<br>
