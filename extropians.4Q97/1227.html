Infinite? OK, but the big question is what order infinity, just how many <br>
decimal places do you need to represent all the points on that line? We know <br>
it can't be the smallest infinity, that of the integers (call it I) because <br>
we already know that I *I = I so the line would only have I points on it and <br>
Cantor proved that's not true.<br>

       <br>
<p>
The complication is not so slight BECAUSE there are only countably many such <br>
numbers. It's very easy to convert a decimal number of any base into a <br>
fraction and that means decimals can only deal with the rational numbers. <br>
Decimals can't even represent a simple irrational number like the square root <br>
of 2, much less PI, and don't even think about using them for Chaitin numbers.<br>
<p>
Using decimals will never work because if you give me 2 rational numbers, <br>
I don't care how close together they are, I can find an aleph-one (and maybe <br>
more) number of irrational numbers between them.<br>
