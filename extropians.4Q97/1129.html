I would like there to be a transhumanist discussion list which<br>
focuses on topics like:<br>
<p>
- Intelligence augmentation<br>
- Neuroscience, connectionism, brain modification<br>
- Artificial intelligence, uploading, superintelligence<br>
- Philosophy of mind<br>
- Relevant issues from computing (e.g. distributed computation,<br>
  new computational media, etc.)<br>
<p>
In other words, everything to do with minds, brains, and<br>
intelligence.<br>
<p>
I want such a list because this is such a crucial nexus of<br>
topics. The Singularity is often held to be about the rapid<br>
emergence of superhuman intelligence. The desirability of mind<br>
uploading rests upon a particular philosophy of mind. And it's<br>
in everyone's interest to know all they can about the brains<br>
they already have.<br>
<p>
One of the attractive features of the extropian and transhuman<br>
lists is the synthesis of ideas that goes on, but I suspect<br>
that the complexity of the overall discussion exceeds anyone's<br>
grasp. I would hope that this particular combination of topics<br>
is broad enough to benefit from synthesis and narrow enough<br>
to remain comprehensible as a whole.<br>
<p>
I'd love to conclude by saying, "And you can join the list<br>
by following these instructions", but I haven't been able to<br>
pull that off. I'm not even sure what the list should be <br>
called. But if anyone wants to create such a list, they can <br>
add my name straight away.<br>
