Concerning Chicago-Area Extropians, Michael Bowling<br>

"...While we wait, how about giving suggestions for<br>
rough dates.  I'll start the bidding with sometime<br>
before Jan 12th..."<br>
<p>
That would be fine for me. If we wind up meeting in<br>
the Chicago area, and people are willing to travel<br>
from neighboring states (!), I'm inclinced to make<br>
things as convenient as possible for the long<br>
distance voyagers.<br>
<p>
However, I have found with all things of this nature<br>
that its best to give people notice well before the<br>
event. By "well before", I mean like a month minimum;<br>
in general, two months is better. Since this thread<br>
began around 2 December, I don't think anyone would<br>
object if I strongly suggest that we not attempt a<br>
meeting prior to 2 January 1998. Usually, I would say<br>
that the date should be SET at least a month in<br>
advance of the event, and we haven't even set the<br>
date yet.<br>
<p>
(Perhaps we should hurry up and settle on a date<br>
then?? Maybe if three of us can agree on a date,<br>
others will consider the matter settled. How about<br>
Saturday, 10 January 1998?)<br>
<p>
Hey, are there any more Chicago &amp; Midwestern<br>
Extropians out there? Chicago? Milwaukee? Madison?<br>
Indianapolis? St. Louis? Quad Cities? Take a break<br>
from lurking and let us know!<br>
<p>
Any more suggestions concerning the timing of a<br>
possible gathering? How about the setting?<br>
Restaurant? House? Bar? All of the above? Suggestions<br>
on other matters?<br>
<p>
(I will be away on vacation from Friday, 5 December<br>
to Monday, 8 December, so I may not manage to respond<br>
to messages very quickly over the next few days,<br>
unless I can find Web access where I'm going.)<br>
