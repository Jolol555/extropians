<i>&gt; &gt;  I assume you haven't yet read Robin Hanson's essay (If Uploads Come First,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;  economy? He seems to reach the same conclusion as you. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And here's me thinking I'm original.</i><br>
<p>
Since you didn't know about the essay, you were original in your own<br>
thinking, although your conclusion was not original (or rather, partially<br>
original - the essay doesn't deal with selling copies of parts of our<br>
minds). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  However, there are a lot of other things that can be traded: virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  environments of differing complexity and uniqueness, access to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  world, knowledge and experiences. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; None of which are directly beneficial to you (unless someone agreed to copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; you in return, although knowledge and experience may be a mild form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; copying)</i><br>
<p>
Huh? Why would they not be useful to me? If I decide I'm bored with the<br>
immense fantasy VR world I inhabit and want (say) a tropical forest world<br>
instead, I would definitely have a use for a VR world. And if I want to<br>
build a private Game of Life universe in a jupiter brain, I would need<br>
physical access and the necessary skills (which does not need to be <br>
copied, I might just as well hire somebody) to do it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Now you know why I want to become an open standard for information</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  gathering and organisation... :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Better start submitting yourself to the ISO.</i><br>
<p>
Judging from the standards they come up with, no thanks. Self mutilation<br>
is not my thing. I would prefer the IETF. <br>
