If you don't know the methods, you have no way of evaluating the accuracy of<br>
their predictions save by waiting around.  That destroys the value of their<br>
predictions.  How do you know it's anything other than wishful thinking?  Or<br>
whether it's based on some silly numerology, like many apocalyptic<br>
predictions?  Even straightforward extropolation is very dubious.<br>
<p>
Moore's law isn't just an extrapolation; it also rests on the observation<br>
that photographic etching processes don't change much in expense when the<br>
resolution is increased.  Setup cost go up, but so far it's been possible to<br>
increase the chip volume to make the per chip setup cost minimal.  This<br>
theoretical basis for Moore's law increases my confidence in its reliability,<br>
and also points out 2 big things which would probably break it: substantial<br>
per chip setup costs and switching to a production basis other than<br>
photographic etching. <br>

<p>
Given that after the better part of a decade we've yet to see any nanotech<br>
mechanism, I'm not holding my breath.  Maybe we'll have a working nanogear by<br>
then - I guess that would count as a toy.<br>
