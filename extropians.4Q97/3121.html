This seems to me exactly right.  It's true that some people fear change on<br>
principle, but as you say, change is inevitable; at any rate, too many<br>
people are too invested in particular changes that benefit them for any<br>
stasist conspiracy to roll back the trajectory of technological<br>
development wholesale.  My impression is that Postrel was actually trying<br>
to repackage libertarianism for the WIRED audience, and that part of the<br>
problem is that libertarianism in its traditional (American) form is<br>
probably inadequate to the future that WIRED and extropian communities are<br>
sensing around the bend...  Postrel writes:  "What dynamists do agree on<br>
is protecting processes rather than trying to engineer outcomes."  This<br>
seems to me dangerous nonsense at best.  Even the project of maintaining a<br>
market order is engineering an outcome as much as protecting a process<br>
(especially considering the highly institutionally and legislatively<br>
mediated things that pass for "markets"  these days).  If it really is the<br>
case that extropian transhumanism aspires to be a kind of movement (as<br>
opposed to just a meeting-place for folks who seem to share certain<br>
idiosyncratic preoccupations), then I hope it hangs its hat on something<br>
with more ideological teeth than the vacuous "change is good."<br>
