<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; too much about their background and general history, methinks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The genlabs simply need better protection, like guards that hit first</i><br>

It *does* prevent the destruction of important research material and<br>
equipment, so the most urgent problem is solved.<br>

True, violence (even if it's rightfully defending one's property)<br>
might trigger more violence and give you a bad image. Unfortunately the<br>
*opposite* isn't true: if you put up no resistance whatsoever and leave<br>
your facilities wide open the activists will attack them anyway. This most<br>
recent incident only proves my point. Besides, most people already have<br>
this image (guards, dogs, barbed wire etc.) of genlabs, so there isn't<br>
really<br>
much to spoil. Most industrial facilities, department stores, warehouses<br>
etc. have high profile security anyway, and nobody really minds. So why not<br>
research facilities? In fact, if your defenses aren't really dangerous<br>
(ok, forget the guards and the dogs), and even have a funny note to them,<br>
they might actually *help to boost your image*. The squirtguns with smelly<br>
goo (that glows in the dark) could be both effective and good for P.R. Kick<br>
ass gently,and with a smile... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of the truly dangerous luddites are not the activists; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; activitsts could just as well be attacking meat trucks, abortion</i><br>
<i>&gt; clinics or racist organisations, their luddism is mostly just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; convenient reason to be an activist. The real danger comes from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "normal people", who can be much more dangerous for research and</i><br>
<i>&gt; development by the power of public opinion, voting and spending money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the people who can convince them that genetic engineering is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unnatural, evil and dangerous. No amount of guards, barbed wire and</i><br>
<i>&gt; dogs can protect againste Jeremy Rifkin and the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; biofundamentalists.</i><br>
I fully agree with you here, but it is no reason to leave the research<br>
facilities/abortion clinics undefended. Barbed wire might not stop<br>
technophobe ideology, but *words* don't stop shotguns, iron<br>
bars and molotov cocktails. The battle against ignorance and malice <br>
must be fought with means appropriate for the specific occasion. Defending<br>
yourself and/or your property isn't un-transhuman afaik.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To quote somebody who was interviewed on Swedish television</i><br>
<i>&gt; (unfortunately without the regional dialect which really made it</i><br>
<i>&gt; funny): "There should be an end to progress so people can keep their</i><br>
<i>&gt; jobs!". That view is dangerously common, and people in general fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; change despite the fact that it helps them in the long run. It is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to use this fear to strike against proponents or technologies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; change such as genetic engineering, the Internet och</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists. Think about it.</i><br>
I've thought about it a lot. I don't see anyone attacking the internet now<br>
or in the (near) future, unless it attacks us first (which is at least<br>
theoretically possible). Transhumanism might be attacked (regardless <br>
of what its proponents might say or do) when it gets "too big for comfort".<br>
Right now transhumanists are usually seen as a bunch of computer <br>
nerds with silly SF fantasies, harmless Utopians. When there will be <br>
more the government and the press and (thus) the public _might_<br>
"rediscover" them and some "incriminating evidence" will be fabricated to<br>
justify persecution. Its been done time and again...<br>
