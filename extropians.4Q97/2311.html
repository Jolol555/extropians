<p>
No I just get knida tired of hearing people making preposterous<br>
statements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The composite body of a Hypercar is not paper-mache thin, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact its monocoque construction makes it much stronger than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional car and probably your 1/2 ton pickup.</i><br>
<p>
Not bloody likely. Ever wonder why more vehicle occupants that are hit<br>
by trucks are killed than occupants of the trucks??? Law of inertia. A<br>
smaller vehicle is a)not going to have the same structural strength as a<br>
much larger utility vehicle and b) will be stopped faster than a larger<br>
vehicle, causing much more traumatic injury.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; crumple like tissue paper.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I could not stop short of the Moose, I would accelerate. (law of</i><br>
<i>&gt; inertia you know.) letting Mr Moose with his now broken legs land</i><br>
<i>&gt; behind me.</i><br>
<p>
Considering that ALL cars are now required to be designed with what are<br>
known as "crumple zones", I highly doubt that this would be the case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lets say I did stop short of this moose. I'd either try and reverse</i><br>
<i>&gt; my course, or sit there quietly and wait for him/her to pass.</i><br>
<p>
IF you see him in time. They tend to have this habit of using vehicle<br>
headlights to iluminate the road first, so they can see that they won't<br>
stub their toes or something crossing the road, so they jump out just as<br>
you reach them. Additionally, their hide is very dark with no sheen, it<br>
seems to suck light into it. ( The Canadian Stealth Program: Driving<br>
moose across the pole....)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If threatened, I'd reach for my trusty Oneida Strike Eagle, notch</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 33.5", 3316 alloy shaft, thunderhead 125 equipped arrow, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; convert Mr bad attitude into 1100lbs of steaks, chops, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; mooseburger. After all it's the law (at least in Alaska) than you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to salvage a game animal if killed (even if struck by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; vehicle). Maybe a nice new full length moosehide jacket and</i><br>
<i>&gt; moccasins as well.</i><br>
<p>
In NH, moose hunting is by lottery. They definitely don't let you take<br>
roadkill home here.<br>
