On 9/26/96, or thereabouts, someone on a literature list said<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  `imagine curling up on a sandy beach with a laptop, browsing through a</i><br>
<i>&gt;magazine'.</i><br>
<p>
and someone else commented:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;This IS perfectly imaginable, isn't it, given perfectly imaginable </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;changes in hardware and software?</i><br>
  <br>
So I speculated cautiously:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Smart paper, built by and out of nanoscale components, with megs of memory</i><br>
<i>&gt;and probably voice activated.  One sheet should do it.  Delivery date?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dunno - 10, 15 years?  Sorry for the delay.</i><br>
<p>
A little over a year later, in yesterday's *Australian* newspaper (8 Oct<br>
97, buried on p. 7 where all the important news tends to be exiled), Nick<br>
Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab was reported as announcing the arrival,<br>
within a year to 18 months, of a book format using a kind of smart paper.  <br>
<p>
It `involves embedding microscopic balls - about one-tenth of an inch in<br>
diameter [sic] - in a coating on the top of each page.  One half of each<br>
ball is... black and the other white.'<br>
<p>
I assume that these `microscopic' yet `1/10th inch' spheres are at most<br>
really 1/100th of an inch or smaller, of the order of an up-market dot<br>
matrix element.<br>
<p>
These pixels can be rotated by an adroit electric charge, impressed<br>
directly by a printer or via `a transparent grid [of] electronic circuitry<br>
overlaid on the paper'.  That paper would be indefinitely reusable.  Text<br>
downloads would arrive from the net.  Morning newspapers would be<br>
downloaded at night, and the paper recyled at the end of the day.  Book<br>
versions might `have a plug in the spine or back' allowing porting<br>
(presumably on a pay-per-access basis from the Web, or maybe from revamped<br>
bookstores).<br>
<p>
Not quite as dazzlingly futuristic as my prediction of last year, but<br>
pretty damned nifty.  And set to change the entire process of traditional<br>
bookselling in very much less than 15 years.  Yippee - I think.   (Anyone<br>
got any more details on this development?)<br>
