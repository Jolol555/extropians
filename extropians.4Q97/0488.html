<i>&gt; Since this is true, debate makes little progress. Therefore</i><br>

<i>&gt; This will generate the tools we need to develop more intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We (or our successors) can then figure out the appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; underlying theories for what are now the fuzzy sciences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are two types of political commentary that are IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate to this list. The first relates to short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; political activities that affect the short-term rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt; technical progress. For example, an attempt to ban research</i><br>
<i>&gt; on faster computers, or to outlaw strong cryptography, may</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualify. The second type depends on a belief that the nature</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our successors may depend on our current non-technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs or actions. If you feel that individualism is</i><br>
<i>&gt; important and you want our successor civilization to include</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals, you may wish to discuss how to bring this about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Note, an "individualism is good" post is IMO useless. A post</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing ways to guide the nacent cizilization toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; individualism may be useful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This post has been an attempt to explain my own thoughts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not attempting to demand any change in style by other</i><br>
<i>&gt; list participants.</i><br>
<p>
I believe that, generally speaking, postings to the list should be about<br>
extropianism and technological progress - not on the basics of<br>
economics/libertarianism.  I am only referring here to the function of<br>
the list.However, I disagree about not conversing with others (apart<br>
from the list) on the value of freedom.  I do not disagree with you,<br>
Dan, on the pending singularity. I may even agree with you and Eliezer<br>
that, once reached, the Singularity may make today's economic<br>
discussions moot.  My disagreement is on discussion of economics *prior*<br>
to reaching the Singularity.<br>
Extropianism has not had any serious enemies.  There  is currently no<br>
organized effort to avoid the S because those would-be antagonists do<br>
not believe in it and  extropian predictions (taken as a whole) are<br>
ignored, believed to be false, or belittled.  We might see anti-cloning,<br>
anti-encryption, and other single-issue prohibitions.  But an outright<br>
organized opposition to the future has not yet been erected.<br>
As our ideas become spread more and more into the mainstream, we will<br>
suddenly find people who believe extropian technological predictions and<br>
will organize against them.  If this happens only after the S then, yes,<br>
it is no use contemplating opposition at this point in time.  It is my<br>
speculative guess that the S won't be reached until the next century.<br>
It is my worry, unlike many of my fellow Extropians, that organized use<br>
of force will be used to stop or rapidly decelerated all applicable<br>
research and technologies related to Transhumanism.  Many will not mind<br>
throwing us into a dark age in order to avoid this.  I am not predicting<br>
this but I am not discounting (yet).<br>
Discussing economic, ethical, social and other philosophical aspects of<br>
Extropianism with friends, family and peers may help expand our support<br>
base.<br>
<p>
I await responses to this post... whether you think I may have a point<br>
or whether you think I'm doom-and-glooming this issue without rational<br>
basis.<br>
