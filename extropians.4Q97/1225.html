  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
  CNN has spread false information on television indicating <br>
  that I said my TWA 800 inquiry was a "sham" and a "plot."<br>
  To counter these lies, the "Goddard Chronicles" has been<br>
  reopened (<a href="http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard">http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard</a>). My work <br>
  was not a sham.  See for yourself that it was factual.<br>
  For it, I've been repeatedly slandered by the media.<br>
<p>
  To support the false claims, CNN culled statements of <br>
  mine out of context from an Internet post, reporting:<br>
<p>
     ...Goddard...said he only pursued the charges <br>
     because he "wanted to give the government a <br>
     black eye by any means that looked opportune."<br>
<p>
     Goddard says he wanted to promote libertarian <br>
     ideology by encouraging distrust of the government.<br>
<p>
  I stated in my Internet post that encouraging distrust <br>
  of the government maybe good "if it's founded," but CNN <br>
  omitted that most critical statement, leaving the false<br>
  impression that I tried to cook up anything however base-<br>
  less it might actually be just to hurt the government.<br>
  That's what the GovtMedia does to me, not me to them.<br>
<p>
  "If it's founded" means if there's basis in FACT for dis-<br>
  trust. So my statements explicitly EXCLUDED the possibility <br>
  of being defined as an admission of the promotion of fraud, <br>
  for I defined the proper spreading of distrust as that <br>
  which is founded in fact. I think there is basis in fact<br>
  for questioning the government on TWA 800 and many other <br>
  areas: <a href="http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard">http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard</a> <br>
<p>
  Hoping to get the media to stop assaulting me with mis-<br>
  information, I took down my webpage on September 11 and <br>
  had DEEP TIMES remove the Goddard Chronicles. But after <br>
  ending my war of "improper inquiry" I am hit harder than <br>
  ever by the media, perhaps in an effort to snuff me out <br>
  for good, which forces me to have the Goddard Chronicles <br>
  made available to allow people to judge for themselves.<br>
<p>
  Below is from the Internet message from which CNN culled <br>
  my statements. My big error, ipso facto, was excessively <br>
  honest self-critique. My effort was to accurately define <br>
  the sociopolitical function of conspiracy theory, when<br>
  it is proper, and what good it can do,  even as I was <br>
  discontinuing it as a means toward effecting social <br>
  change, for the media will "kill you" if you try:<br>

Ian Goddard's Internet message (10/20/97)__________________<br>
<p>
I think it was a big mistake to encourage people to <br>
believe the Navy did it. How could I know? I just <br>
wanted to give the govt a black eye by any means <br>
that looked opportune. TWA 800 was just a vehicle <br>
for my larger agenda. I think others, like Tom <br>
Shoemaker, may be in TWA 800 for TWA 800. It's <br>
not that I didn't care about the loss of life,<br>
I did/I do. To do no harm is a primary axiom.<br>
<p>
Why would I want to give govt a black eye? To pro-<br>
mote by default libertarian ideology. One way to <br>
get people to stop voting for more govt is to <br>
encourage distrust and suspicion of the govt. Well,  &lt;-------<br>
if it's founded, maybe that's a good thing. Too      &lt;-------<br>
bad people didn't distrust govt more in Germany<br>
just prior to Hitler. A healthy dose of anti-govt<br>
paranoia then might have saved millions. I don't<br>
think the idea that "anti-govt paranoia" is some<br>
kind of disease that must be eradicated is such<br>
a healthy concept.<br>
<p>
But what if I was wrong about the Navy having done <br>
it? Then ipso facto I've done a bad thing. In short,<br>
the business of finger pointing is a risky business,<br>
since your always maybe doing the wrong thing. Unless<br>
you saw the event by 100%, which if a missile flew out<br>
of the water would mean seeing also underwater, you never <br>
can know for 100% sure what happened. I don't know what <br>
happened to TWA 800 and probably never will, so I'm <br>
not going to guess. I'll leave the finger pointing<br>
to those who are more foolhardy than I.<br>
