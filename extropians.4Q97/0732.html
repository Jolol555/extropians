In an earlier post in response to the "Landlord" analogy, I<br>
accused Ian Goddard of willful evasion and intellectual dishonesty.<br>
After seeing some of the follow-ups, I now realize now that I had<br>
somehow failed to read all of the post, and perhaps misinterpreted<br>
some of what I did read.  I apologize for my hasty accusation, and<br>
if it has caused anyone to doubt Mr. Goddard's honesty, I urge<br>
them to disregard my comments on the matter.  If it has caused<br>
some to question mine, I don't blame you, and I offer no excuse<br>
for my unwarranted judgment.<br>
<p>
I have been, and hope I will continue to be, quick, vocal, and<br>
without restraint in my opinions.  I also hope that those<br>
listening understand that it is because I firmly believe that<br>
the most effective means of human communication is to encourage<br>
unfettered--even brutal--speech.  Though I do not believe that<br>
speakers have any obligation of tolerance, I do think they are<br>
obliged to be honest and to check their facts, which I failed<br>
to do in this case.<br>
<p>
I apologize to Mr. Goddard and to the rest of the readers of <br>
this list for my failure.<br>
