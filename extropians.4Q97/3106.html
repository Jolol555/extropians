<i>&gt; &gt;Yes, some kind of "responsibility Turing test" might be needed. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it could consist of several scenarios the requester is confronted</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with, and its actions are studied, especially when asked to predict or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extend the scenario. For example, the child might be asked "How will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you pay for food and rent if we make you an adult?".</i><br>
<p>
Considering all of the millions of adults who already don't have to deal<br>
with this question, I'd say that one is hardly applicable in todays<br>
world. An answer of "I plan on living off welfare" is just as acceptable<br>
as "I plan on making a killing on the stock market".<br>
<p>
I think more applicable questions would be like:<br>
<p>
What are your rights under the Constitution and what do they mean?<br>
What are your ethical standards?<br>
What do you think about another person's right to exist?<br>
What do you understand about contract theory?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I like the idea, but it would have to be modified.  This test</i><br>
<i>&gt; measures whether one should be extended a 'privilege', not whether an</i><br>
<i>&gt; entity should be extended a 'right'.  The two terms tend to get used</i><br>
<i>&gt; interchangeably when in fact they represent two different concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The conferrence of adult status through artifical means is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; privilege, not a right, although the conferrence of it may have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis in some rights, such as the right to self-determination or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to free passage.  (Normal growth into adulthood is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered a right, although some activists are pushing for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognition of exercise of reproductive functions as a right.)</i><br>
<p>
Priviledges are what big government bureaucrats call rights that<br>
individuals demand that are not explicitly stated in the Bill of RIghts,<br>
even though the 9th amendment restricts them from doing so.<br>
<p>
As found at: <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~bxi/billrigt.htm">http://www.interlog.com/~bxi/billrigt.htm</a> :<br>
<p>
				AMENDMENT IX<br>
<p>
	The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall 	not be<br>
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the 	people. <br>
<p>
THis means that the people have the right to make up any rights they<br>
feel like, so long as the Constitution does not already enumerate them,<br>
while the 10th amendment empowers the states to enact or restrict rights<br>
in their own constitutions, as approved by the people under those<br>
documents. This is why states can outlaw abortion, for example, if the<br>
people in that state so vote.<br>
<p>
NOTE: The tenth amendment, as seen below, is used by state officials to<br>
deny people rights guaranteed them under the 9th amendment, even though<br>
those states have passed no state Constitutional Amendments restricting<br>
such rights. THis is probably the biggest source of conflict in the<br>
Constitution.<br>
<p>
<p>
                                AMENDMENT X<br>
<p>
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor <br>
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States <br>
respectively, or to the people.<br>
<p>
An example of this, is the concept of a driver's license as a<br>
priviledge. Even though the Constitution guarrantees that the right to<br>
free passage cannot be infringed by the states (interstate commerce,<br>
etc.), the state's will argue that since they built the roads, that they<br>
can dictate who gets to drive on those roads. They refuse to consider<br>
that since the state roads have paved over and across everything else,<br>
it is almost impossible for a person to drive a vehicle anywhere NOT on<br>
state roads, so the state has a monopoly on roads, and therefore on free<br>
passage. refusing to grant a driver's license is refusal of right of<br>
free passage...The same applies to state regulation of aviation and<br>
water travel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Western concept of 'rights' has never been predicated on a base</i><br>
<i>&gt; of understanding of the consequences or results of having that right,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the concept includes the quality of inherentness.  In other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; an entity that has rights is born/created/built with them from</i><br>
<i>&gt; inception.  Later on, as the entity grows, develops and learns,</i><br>
<i>&gt; privileges (such as operating a vehicle, holding a job or</i><br>
<i>&gt; participation in civic structures) are conferred based on that level</i><br>
<i>&gt; of responsibility.</i><br>
<p>
Only to adherents of Natural Law doctrine. For those who go by the force<br>
doctrine, any body politic can exercise whatever rights it is willing to<br>
fight and die for. Those that it fails to express such interest in<br>
protecting typically are atropied by the encroachment of tyrannical big<br>
government bureaucrats on the whole, by corporate masters in the<br>
workplace, and by fellow citizens in the everyday.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this sounds confusing, one method of distinguishing a 'right' from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 'privilege' is to ask:  is it open-ended or concrete? Privileges</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend toward the concrete and practical;  rights tend toward the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptual and developmental.  Another method is to consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt; causal relationship:  privileges often stem from rights, but rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; never stem from privileges.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Priviledges as stated above, tend to be those rights that not enough<br>
interest can be generated in to guarrantee by Constitutional decree, or<br>
that atrophy over time. Gun ownership, privacy, and voting seem to be<br>
rights that are most noticably atrophying this decade.<br>
