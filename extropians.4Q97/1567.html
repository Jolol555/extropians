<p>
  IAN: The FACT is that the major media<br>
  will not present any of the evidence<br>
  suggestive of Navy-culpability, but<br>
  instead will only spread disinforma-<br>
  tion about that evidence and those <br>
  presenting it. The FACT is the media<br>
  will only favorably and even unquest-<br>
  ioningly present the government's line.<br>
<p>
  For a libertarian or Extropian to fail<br>
  to see this and fail to be concerned<br>
  is a tragedy. The de facto nationaliza-<br>
  tion of the major media should be a <br>
  a topic of great concern. The means <br>
  by which it occurs, I believe, is <br>
  government contracting and economic<br>
  benefits between the entities that <br>
  own major media establishments and<br>
  the government, resulting in an eager-<br>
  to-please-the-govt attitude on the <br>
  part of media establishments. The <br>
  solution to this massive problem is <br>
  to abolish govt monetary intake by 95%.<br>
<p>
  While you and others have had your <br>
  heads in the sand, FLIR (Forward Look-<br>
  ing Infrared) video has been leaked <br>
  via former CIA head Bill Colby (found <br>
  dead shortly thereafter), about which <br>
  multiple FLIR experts agree shows <br>
  automatic machine-gun fire going into<br>
  the Branch Davidian community prior<br>
  to and as the fire breaks out. This<br>
  FLIR is filed in court, in the case<br>
  against the govt for wrongful death.<br>
  There is no question of authenticity.<br>
  While the Washington Post did a very<br>
  good report on the Waco FLIR, how many<br>
  of the major media on TV have covered <br>
  this compelling evidence of FBI mass <br>
  murder? Zero. Is this not a problem?<br>
<p>
  Is a media that refuses to disclose<br>
  evidence that the FBI committed mass<br>
  murder, but instead continues to pump<br>
  out the FBI line serving the public<br>
  interest? I'd say definitely NOT! The<br>
  media serves only the govt's interest.<br>
  This is a BIG problem! This is a sign<br>
  post on the road to serfdom.<br>
<p>
  The media and you may be able to heap <br>
  lie and ad hominem on those that have<br>
  promoted the Navy-missile theory, but<br>
  lies and ad hominem are not logical<br>
  arguments, they are illogical and are<br>
  prima facie evidence of an effort to <br>
  squash freedom of inquiry.<br>
