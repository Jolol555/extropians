Hi Greg, I'm just reading the "Taoist body" by Kristofer Schipper, which<br>
analyses the social impact of taoism on Chinese society. I think you<br>
would be interested about this quote about  "Activist taoism"..<br>
<p>
"This situation (opposition between taoism and imperial cult -Remi) lead<br>
to revolt, and, at the 1st century before our era, messianic and<br>
millenarists movements inspired by taoism appear, with the hope to give<br>
birth to the reign of the Great equality (Tai Ping)  which existed<br>
before our civilization and come back after. The state fight these<br>
movements (snip) . The great revolt of the Yellow Turbans, in 182 of our<br>
era, became so important that the Han dynasty exhausted and died in<br>
trying to repress it".<br>
<p>
We can also remember The Triad society, before becoming a simple<br>
gangster organization, was also a religious organization full of taoist<br>
symbols and ritual, whose purpose was to destroy the Mandchu dynasty and<br>
let the Ming come back instead. So Taoists are quite used to political<br>
activism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With its stress on the value of nature, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditions may become the springboard for a wider awareness of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;impact of</i><br>
<i>&gt;low-tech industrialization.  Furthermore, the "magical" aspects of</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional Taoism might well also serve Asia well</i><br>
<p>
According the  historian of science Joseph Needham, most of the<br>
scientific discoveries in China were made by taoists, confuciansist<br>
being only interested in social philosophy.<br>
