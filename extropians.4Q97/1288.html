Thanks for taking the time to reply my mail.....Micheal Lorrey<br>
I'm definitely like the idea of comets divertion and its usage<br>
to terraform planets like Mars,...<br>
Once there is sufficient CO2 in Mars' atmosphere, is that<br>
the time to seed the martian soil with artificially engineered plants<br>
and does that have consequence on the atmospheric pressure <br>
and temperature again....( I thought if CO2 is converted to O2 <br>
the temperature would drop again,...the greenhouse fades.....<br>
so drop a few more comets,...?! more water and CO2 and<br>
the process continues until a saturation point where there<br>
is the right mixture ( earth-proportion ) of gases....hey hey hey <br>
...or at least of fitter extropian-minded (post)-humans to live on<br>
...i.e our future generations....<br>
Is there anyone on the list working on artificial engineered plants<br>
these range to also encompass very large trees that can be grow <br>
on comets to take us out of the solar system....ever heard of those<br>
Dysonian proposals...?<br>
Are there also other materials that are as rad as buckyballs<br>
and hows the progress on buckyball manufacturing?<br>
Anyone care to contribute <br>

<i>&gt; &gt; NASA / JPL ...? Landing a probe on a comet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this time,.. good start, how about using</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; comets as platforms out of the solar system</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or land a comet on Mars to terraform ?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, now your getting into my favorite subjects...To anyone interested</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt; terraforming Mars, I suggest you read Kim Stanley Robinson's _Red_Mars_</i><br>
<i>&gt; trilogy, which is possibly the most scientifically realistic view of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mars terraforming I've ever seen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Essentially, it is thought that there is enough CO2 in the poles and un</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rocks that if the atmosphere could be heated up a bit, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically cause a process of outgassing that would raise Mars'</i><br>
<i>&gt; atmosphere up to a level of between 300-500 millibars, almost all CO2.</i><br>
<i>&gt; THis is equivalent to atmospheric pressure in Lhasa, Tibet. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this level, greenhouse effects would raise the average equatorial</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperatures to around 50 deg F. It is not known how much water there</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; on Mars, but it is thought from current data that there is enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; fill the northern hemisphere with a 1 million sq kilometer ocean with</i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt; average depth of 100 feet or so, at the above cited atmospheric temps</i><br>
<i>&gt; and pressures. In order to make this atmosphere livable without oxygen</i><br>
<i>&gt; masks, we would need to seed the planet with engineered plantlife. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; oxygen conversion will of course reduce the greenhouse effects, thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooling the planet, unless we replace the lost CO2 with other</i><br>
greenhouse<br>
<i>&gt; gasses, like CFCs, methane, etc. It is doubtful that there was enough</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; a period of lifebuilding on mars in the past (if the current evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; supporting such life is confirmed), to provide adequate fossil fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources, so all energy will come from solar or nuclear power</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It has been proposed that if somewhere between 2-5 comets were dropped</i><br>
<i>&gt; on mars, this would provide the necessary heat, additional gasses for</i><br>
<i>&gt; accelerated pressurization, and additional greenhouse gasses to</i><br>
maintain<br>
<i>&gt; a stable atmosphere, with  a later need for production of CFCs  at a</i><br>
<i>&gt; level of between 5-10% of current terran production.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for exploration of comets, its a needed mission. As the Huyakutake</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Hale-Bopp comets showed us, there are plenty of objects out there</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are undiscovered that could show up at any moment. if we are to</i><br>
<i>&gt; come up with concrete plans to divert earth intercepting objects we</i><br>
need<br>
<i>&gt; to know exactly how  such objects are built so we know whether to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear explosives or land nuclear thrusters, etc. We also need to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same with asteroids of the near earth variety. This precautionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; program would then be the harbinger of an asteroid mining industry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for NASA and JPL, well, they do good work, but, dammit, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; substituting manned exploration with VIDEO GAMES!!! I think its</i><br>
entirely<br>
<i>&gt; BS of the highest magnitude that we are putting up with the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; "smaller, faster, cheaper, less imaginative, less risky" program. Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; again its about time people saw how incompetent big government programs</i><br>
<i>&gt; are at exploration. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BUckyballs? I think that once we get buckytubes made in sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; lengths to weave with to make Fuller forms, we can then start thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about mega scale projects. Is anyone on the list working with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tubes????</i><br>
