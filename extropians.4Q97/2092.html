 Therefore, I suggest that all those who post should be Extropy<br>
Institute (EI) members.  I do not believe that basic EI membership<br>
should have a price tag though. Another electronic community that I<br>
am a member of (the HTML Writer's Guild at <a href="http://www.hwg.org">http://www.hwg.org</a>.) has<br>
several levels of membership but basic membership is free.  In this<br>
way those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can<br>
subscribe to a print copy magazine (sort of like Web Magazine), other<br>
services, get a plaque (ala Public Television) or whatever. A live<br>
chat room for Level 2 members, for example might be set up.  An<br>
archive of the most popular threads could be available for Level 3.  A<br>
member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or online by access number) is<br>
possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list but<br>
would be paid for by the members who desire such services.  It's a<br>
thought worth serious thought. <br>

That's an interesting idea.  It would allow Max to say with almost a <br>
straight face that we have "tens of thousands of members world wide".<br>
<p>
On the other side, I recall a conversation I had with the editor of <br>
*The Journal of Practical Applications in Space* (I've forgotten her <br>
name). She claimed that she had little success getting colleges and <br>
universities to subscribe until she *increased* the rate for <br>
institutions from the standard ~30 dollars to ~150 dollars.  Seems <br>
they didn't believe it was a "serious" journal until then.  <br>
<p>
I'd also like to point out that there are really two kinds of <br>
membership organizations.  One has a popular membership like the <br>
Planetary Society or the old L-5 Society, and the membership fees <br>
are in the neighborhood of $30.  The other type is a "professional" <br>
society (though there is no real requirement that you be in the <br>
"profession") like the AIAA or the American Library Association or <br>
the World Futurist Society with fees from generally more than $100 <br>
and often several hundred (my wife pays nearly $200 for ALA <br>
membership).<br>
<p>
The blunt fact is that the Extropy Institute has been a flop as a<br>
popular membership organization.  I think there is a lot to be said<br>
for moving towards the professional society model, if for no other<br>
reason than it needs to do something  different, since what it was<br>
doing wasn't successful.  By posing more as a "serious" (I get the<br>
giggles every time I type that) think tank, policy wonk,<br>
professional society it may be more successful and I think will<br>
definately be taken more seriously by those who are not and never<br>
will be members.  Maybe Max can even revive the print Extropy and<br>
have libraries line up to pay $400/year for it!<br>

Just my .02 nanoDirksen worth.<br>
