Someone (I think it was a Supreme Court Justice, but I'm not sure...) once<br>
said "Most people think that they are thinking when they are merely<br>
rearranging their prejudices."<br>
<p>
Seems to me that both you and those you rail against qualify.<br>
<p>
Let's try for an actual dialog, instead:<br>
<p>
Erik, Is it your belief that monopolies are somehow different from The<br>
State? What if they're *the same thing*? What if most monopolies stem from<br>
a systematic violation of the Non-Aggression Principle? That would make<br>
them evil, whether they call themselves the Federation of Slobbovian<br>
States or FriendlyGigantoCorp... Wouldn't it?<br>
<p>
The Non-Aggression Principle is concisely formulated as: <br>
"that no one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force  <br>
against another human being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation."<br>
<p>
What say you?<br>
