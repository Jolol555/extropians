I am so gd sick of the libertarian argument, pro and con.  It's the same<br>
thing, and the same thing, and the same thing, over and over again.<br>
Do we ever really accomplish anything by it?  Couldn't there be another<br>
forum where it can be argued?  It sucks up so much time and energy.<br>
Here on this list, we are supposed to be able to avoid these discussions<br>
of the basics.  Yet this one issue, of whether coercion is necessary or<br>
proper, comes up again and again.  I just delete the messages, and I don't<br>
want to force my view on others, but can't we rededicate ourselves to the<br>
principle of avoiding debate on this topic?<br>
