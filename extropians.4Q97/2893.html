The problem with this cite is its partiality.  As I understand it,<br>
Freeman's standing is hardly secure.  He might well be correct - I have a<br>
lot of sympathy for his analysis - but I'd like to see an array of<br>
commentary from several sides of the controversy, not just Freeman<br>
repeating himself.  Incidentally, the noted Australian playwright David<br>
Williamson recently had some success with THE HERETIC, a stage<br>
dramatisation of the Mead-Freeman scandal (which has Freeman's imprimatur).<br>
 Williamson, formerly a sardonic but engaged chronicler of the left, has<br>
lately been adopting a different position, with plays dealing with<br>
malicious and deceitful claims of sexual harassment by a young female<br>
student against her male university teacher, and the supposed failures of<br>
`multiculturalism' and attacks on the English literature canon by evil<br>
postmodernists.<br>
