<i>&gt; &gt; Political rights, authoritiy, and power are thought to be derived from</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; to fight and die to gain such rights, authority, or power, either for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themselves, or for the group of people they represent. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Libertarians around the world tend to also be athiests, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-American Libertarians, I cannot understand any justification for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarian atheist to not support the force doctrine, and givne the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nature of Libertarian philosophy, which holds that all power and rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; derives from the individual, I cannot understand how any Libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; atheist can not support the right of the individual to keep and bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; arms. ANything other than this seems extremely hypocritical to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The force doctrine doesn't imply that *firearms* are necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserve freedom. It merely requires that an individual have the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep and bear arms. I agree that this essential point is obvious and</i><br>
<i>&gt; unassailable in light of the Second Amendment. Much of the debate going</i><br>
<i>&gt; on around here concerns whether firearms are a practical means to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; end.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Firearms are easy to make, relatively inexpensive, and the most powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; type of weapon the average person can get. In this regard, they seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the most practical choice for self-preservation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However I'm not so sure that the production costs of firearms reflect</i><br>
<i>&gt; the external costs associated with their distribution. Firearms are</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical in large part because they are so inexpensive. But are they</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificially inexpensive? Shouldn't the price of purchasing a firearm</i><br>
<i>&gt; mirror the increased risk to self, and others even if only accidental</i><br>
<i>&gt; harms are involved?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The purpose of a firearm is to throw metal at high speeds, over a</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerable distance, with accuracy. We all know that the intent of</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a stated purpose is to make killing more efficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A tool used for killing is useful only insofar as the probability of</i><br>
<i>&gt; causing death increases with its at-will use in a wide variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances. Firearms seem practical for self-preservation in large</i><br>
<i>&gt; part because they are useful by this standard. Consider that a nail-gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; has the same general purpose as a firearm (throwing metal at high</i><br>
<i>&gt; speeds) and would suffice to kill something, but its effectiveness for</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing is limited (a nail-gun has a short range, it is heavy, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires a pretty powerful compressor, it is inaccurate, etc.) In short,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is an impractical killing device.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, the point: the purchase price of a nail-gun may not reflect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; external costs of accidental harms, but it also does not reflect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; external benefits that result from its use for the purposes it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed for and the purposes it accomplishes most efficiently. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; firearm designed for the express purpose of making killing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient has external benefits only insofar as killing something can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a benefit (rare and isolated situations which constitute a separate</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, this analysis neglects to weigh a possible external benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved in throwing metal at high speeds, over considerable distances,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with accuracy. Namely, it is amusing for some people. Does this benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in the aggregate) outweigh or equal the aggregate costs of accidental</i><br>
<i>&gt; death? I would guess that it probably doesn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this is so, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling us, and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring</i><br>
<i>&gt; your own personal autonomy and freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Given that the annual number of times firearms are used in self defense<br>
here in the US is anywhere between 600,000 to 2.4 million, depending who<br>
you talk to, this comes out to a rate range of 240 to 1,000 incidents of<br>
successful self defense with a firearm per 100,000 population. Comparing<br>
this to a murder rate of around 10 per 100,000 population, and a<br>
firearms related accident (not necessarily fatal) rate of .06 per<br>
100,000 population, I think it shows pretty clearly that the benefits,<br>
not even counting the recreational benefits, far outweigh the potential<br>
costs.<br>
<p>
This could be formulated in a very easy question as an analogy: <br>
<p>
If you could take this magical pill that would increase your chances of<br>
living to 100 years of age by 24 to 100 times, would you take it??? I<br>
sure would.<br>
