A single iron crystal has been considered as an explanation for a few types<br>
of anisotropy measured in the core.<br>
<p>
While a single, huge iron crystal may sound incredible, it is actually<br>
fairly plausible.  Most substances exhibit allotropes and crystal<br>
restructuring that only occur under extremes of heat and pressure, and most<br>
of which are unstable under "normal" conditions (diamond is an example).<br>
Iron at ordinary pressures changes its crystalline structure back and forth<br>
between FCC and BCC depending on the temperature.  I would imagine that<br>
center of earth conditions could be replicated in the laboratory to verify<br>
if iron undergoes any type of interesting organizational change under those<br>
conditions.  I might add that the high temp/pressure conditions expected in<br>
the core are ideal for large metal crystal formation, as there is enough<br>
energy to lubricate the reorganization of the atoms and enough pressure to<br>
control their organization.<br>
