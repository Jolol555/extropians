<p>
...Many things, some out of lack of knowledge and information. Which why<br>
I'm on this list. Some to make other rethink their worldviews (don't know<br>
if I'm succeeding at all ;-).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;: It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents</i><br>
<i> &gt;: for solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Are any of these patents more than 17 years old?</i><br>
<p>
Very possible, but even then they've slowed any competition down<br>
considerably, bought themselves 17 more fat years (and they are fat).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Experience suggests that if an agency is empowered to override</i><br>
<i> &gt;the choices of the marketplace, it will go far beyond "solving</i><br>
<i> &gt;the problems that the market cannot solve" and extend its power</i><br>
<i> &gt;as far as it can reach. </i><br>
<p>
That's not my experience.<br>
Because why are so many European governements privatising things like<br>
railroads and telecom then? Giving away control over transport &amp;<br>
communication to 'the market'? Not the thing power-hungry 'terrocrats' (one<br>
of the strangest - and paranoid - terms I've learned on this list) would do.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I prefer the minor inconveniences of</i><br>
<i> &gt;market solutions, to the side-effects of superseding the market.</i><br>
<p>
maybe we have different ideas about what a 'minor inconvienence' is, or<br>
what effects could emerge by _not_  superseding the market every now and<br>
then (see below).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;: The idea that there is a single method/solution/answer to all problems</i><br>
<i> &gt;: is (IHMO) denying the complexity of some of those problems.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The idea that the market represents "a single solution" is denying</i><br>
<i> &gt;the very natures of market and government! The market is many methods</i><br>
<i> &gt;running in parallel; government is ONE answer imposed by force in place</i><br>
<i> &gt;of all possible others.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe I've misunderstood but AFAIKT all market mechanisms basically are<br>
driven by the desire of sufficient induvidual consumers to pay for a<br>
distinct product or service (but sorrect me if I'm wrong, I'm not an<br>
economist).<br>
<p>
The system of governement can be used _alongside_ market allocation-systems<br>
to provide soloutions to large-scale problems that no commercial company<br>
could solve (and that maybe a lot of consumers would, initially, not want<br>
to pay for)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;How much would people have been willing to pay to save Stalin in 1942?</i><br>
<i> &gt;How much did we pay to subsidize grain sales to Brezhnev?</i><br>
<i> &gt;Both interventions kept the USSR alive longer than it deserved.</i><br>
<p>
Keeping the USSR not going in '42 was not really an option, just letting<br>
the Germans have all those resources that they controlled in the Ukraine<br>
(lot's of coalmines and such) would have made things a lot tougher on the<br>
west front.<br>
<p>
I don't know about the grain, over here agriculture is heavely subsidized<br>
and I don't agree with that at all. Why subsidize producing a product that<br>
nobody wants (aparently) and that causes as lot of pollution on the side<br>
(The NOx output of the Dutch cattle is greater than that of the the Dutch<br>
traffic)?.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;(How do you spell Brezhnev in Dutch?)</i><br>
<p>
The same: Brezhnev (or maybe Breznjev), but senile dinosaur also works ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;: I don't think the zillion dollars it cost. But it was money well spent</i><br>
<i> &gt;: considering the alternative</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;For whom? America was never in any serious danger of conquest, only of</i><br>
<i> &gt;destruction - and that was brought on by its own imperial foreign policy.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but the world is larger that the US (Really!). I for one sure am glad<br>
the US-gov was guarding 'our' side of the Berlin wall because without<br>
US-aid Europe could very well have been overrun by the USSR. So thanks,<br>
remind me to buy you drinks if/when we meet ;-)<br>
<p>
And altough the foreign policy of the US this century has some nasty<br>
aspects, it's lovely compared to the things Stalin would have done if given<br>
a chance. Don't think he would have stopped his tanks once he had western<br>
Europe, Britain &amp; France made that mistake in the 30's, allowing a little<br>
annexation to satisfy a little dictator. Things quickly got out of control,<br>
and Uncle whiskers had to clean-up the mess.<br>
<p>
Of course it is a US-interest to keep as much of the world more or less<br>
capitalistic, you make products, you need customers to buy 'em.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;: and, in retrospect, maybe even a good investment with the</i><br>
<i> &gt;: technology spinn-off and the Chinese market opening up and such...</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;How many war-dead is a spinoff worth?</i><br>
<p>
If the US had not fought the Cold war (and WW-II) many more people would<br>
have died. There was no alternative, you can't coexist with the likes of<br>
Stalin and the German guy. You win the war or you get dead/annexated<br>
(almost as bad).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;What research never happened, because the money to do it</i><br>
<i> &gt;was taxed away to spend on war?</i><br>
<p>
Historically research (especially applied-technical) is always done faster,<br>
and on larger scale, with larger budgets during a war or threat of a war.<br>
The spinoff of this research pays for it almost always (Aluminium alloys,<br>
Teflon, Internet) after such a war (this doesn't make war a less terrible<br>
thing, I'd like to see the same resources going into space-exploration now<br>
as during the sixties but this seems hard to sell to the general public).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;How the Cold War is relevant to Microsoft, I'm sure I don't know.</i><br>
<p>
The Cold War is relevant in the argument that certain problems cannot be<br>
solved by consumer demand, because of their scale and complexity. This<br>
discussion is relevant to MS to the extend that I do not believe that<br>
monopolies will dissapear in a anarcho-capitalistic society (contrary to<br>
Daniel and others ;-).<br>
<p>
But maybe I still do not fully understand anarchocapitalism. In such a<br>
society, without a state of any sort, who makes and upholds law's? or is it<br>
every person for him/herself?<br>
<p>
How do you go from the present situation to such a system?<br>
<p>
Are these questions explained in a practical manner in any of the books on<br>
the Extropian Reading list? (no I haven't read them all, still busy)<br>
<p>
Thanx for the info.<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
Arjen<br>
