ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART III<br>
<p>
by Frederick Mann<br>
								10/12/97<br>
<p>
Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
This is the third in a series of articles on the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  The second article<br>
included a brief discussion of the "No-Opposition<br>
Strategy."  You can get the first two articles<br>
from &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt; or by<br>
request from &lt;<a href="mailto:f-prime-activist.com">mailto:f-prime-activist.com</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
This article will elaborate on the No-Opposition<br>
Strategy and introduce the "It's Not All-or-Nothing"<br>
principle.<br>

<p>
The No-Opposition Strategy<br>
--------------------------<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"If you can avoid it, never play on the other guy's field, by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other guy's rules, or with the other guy's ball.  He didn't design</i><br>
<i>&gt;_his_ system to give _you_ the advantage.  Remember that organisms</i><br>
<i>&gt;defending their own territory are twice as effective as an intruding</i><br>
<i>&gt;attacker." -- L. Neil Smith</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
A basic theme of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
is "building freedom" rather than "fighting<br>
for freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."<br>
I believe that if a critical mass of people<br>
were to focus on building freedom, corrupt<br>
political systems will eventually lose their<br>
power and influence.<br>
<p>
I don't know how many people would constitute<br>
such a critical mass, nor how influencial their<br>
economic power would have to be, in order for<br>
their combined economic activities to have a<br>
decisive impact on the expansion of freedom,<br>
on one hand, and the decline of the power and<br>
influence of coercive political systems, on<br>
the other hand.<br>
<p>
The fifth main principle of the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom is the No-Opposition Strategy.  When we<br>
oppose something, or try to reform it, we usually<br>
encounter opposition.  Our effort elicits an almost<br>
automatic counter-effort.  In practicing the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom, we don't attempt to change, oppose,<br>
reform, or overthrow any  political or economic systems.<br>
We simply create our own voluntary alternatives in the<br>
free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
In the second article of this series, I used the<br>
examples of Ghandi, the fall of the Berlin wall,<br>
and the collapse of the soviet empire to illustrate<br>
that the terrocrats (terrorist bureaucrats or coercive<br>
political agents) were not invincible -- "The power<br>
of terrocrats is tenuous -- largely based on illusion,<br>
flimsy, fragile, and of little substance."<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Peaceful resistance can work, but ONLY against those who aren't willing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to mass-murder the resisters.  Gandhi &amp; MLK were fortunate enough to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;up against opponents who were unwilling to do so.  Anyone who thinks the</i><br>
<i>&gt;US government would be equally unwilling is invited to consider what</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened to the Bonus Army in 1932, back when the U.S. government was</i><br>
<i>&gt;considerably less willing to use force against its citizenry than it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;six &amp; a half decades later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exagerrating the effectiveness of peaceful resistance is tantamount to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sending the gullible to their deaths.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
My examples may have created the impression that<br>
I advocate peaceful resistance.  Let me emphasize<br>
that peaceful resistance may be appropriate for<br>
certain people in certain situations, but it does<br>
not fit at all into the context of the No-Opposition<br>
Strategy.<br>
<p>
Peaceful resistance is a form of opposition, which<br>
tends to elicit counter-effort.  It involves forms<br>
of "fighting for freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."<br>
<p>
There are various styles of practicing the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom.  The most powerful is *invisibility*.<br>
You operate in such a manner that you and your economic<br>
activities are effectively invisible to terrocrats.<br>
There is no protesting terrocrat actions; no resistance<br>
to terrocrat actions; no fighting terrocrats in court.<br>
<p>
Protesting, resisting, and fighting may have a place<br>
in the Economic Means to Freedom, but have no place in<br>
the No-Opposition Strategy.  There are times to take<br>
a stand, and times to take evasive action.  There are<br>
also times to just pay the terrocrats what they demand,<br>
because that's the least evil.<br>
<p>
In practicing the Economic Means to Freedom for a quarter<br>
of a century, I've paid terrocrats around $500 in "fines,"<br>
maybe $5,000 - $10,000 for "car registration" and "driver's<br>
licences," and around $10,000 - $15,000 in various "sales<br>
taxes."<br>
<p>
No terrocrat has ever used a gun against me, or threatened<br>
to do so.  No terrocrat has ever pointed a gun at me.<br>
Their threats have always come in the form of *words*.<br>
As indicated in the first article of this series, the<br>
practitioner of the Economic Means to Freedom may face,<br>
in general, fewer risks from terrocrats than people "in<br>
the system."<br>
<p>
I've received a few threatening letters from terrocrats.<br>
In some cases I paid the "fine" demanded; in other cases<br>
I sent them a reply that resulted in them deciding that<br>
it would be more profitable for them to pursue other,<br>
easier victims or "marks."<br>
<p>
By making the above payments, I supported the terrocrats.<br>
You could argue that, to the extent I paid terrocrats, I<br>
practiced the Economic Means to Slavery.  This suggests<br>
the sixth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
<p>
<p>
It's Not All-or-Nothing<br>
-----------------------<br>
<p>
The sixth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom is<br>
that you don't have to suddenly switch from one extreme<br>
to the other.  You can shift into the free-enterprise<br>
sector in stages.  You can compartmentalize your life<br>
and affairs so your assets, earnings, and economic<br>
activities are partially in the private (or even public!)<br>
sector and partially in the free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
[The first article in this series explains the distinction<br>
between the three different economic sectors.]<br>
<p>
Freedom Technology consists of the practical knowledge,<br>
methods, and skills to live free; the street-smart<br>
know-how to outwit and run rings around terrocrats;<br>
the means to protect your earnings and assets from<br>
terrocrats and other thieves and robbers.  Freedom<br>
Technology enables you to legally, elegantly, and<br>
safely shift some or all of your economic activities<br>
into the free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
Some of the practitioners of the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom, who facilitate this shift, may become the<br>
millionaires and billionaires of the next century.<br>
Emerging free-enterprise institutions, such as those<br>
mentioned in the first article of this series, are<br>
likely to play an expanding role in the economic<br>
shift into the free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
An important characteristic of the shift into the<br>
free-enterprise sector is that as it grows, it<br>
becomes easier for new people to join the shift.<br>
The emerging financial free-enterprise institutions<br>
(see first article in series) already make it much<br>
easier now, than it was 10 years ago, to shift into<br>
the free-enterprise sector.  And as the shift grows,<br>
so do the number of free-enterprise businesses.<br>
This increases the opportunities for freedom lovers<br>
to work in or with businesses that don't kowtow to<br>
terrocrats.<br>
