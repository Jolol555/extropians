On Fri, 14 Nov 1997 20:10:49 -0600, Ryan Marsh &lt;ryanm@wl.net&gt; said to<br>
'Christopher Whipple' &lt;byteboy@simons-rock.edu&gt;:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for MS products checking for piracy, I haven't been able to prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt;any current</i><br>
<i>&gt;products do what he said but it is possible to include that kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;functionality.  I am glad that MS</i><br>
<i>&gt;would do such a thing.  Piracy is illegal is he supporting crime?</i><br>
<p>
No, I am not supporting crime.  In fact, I was speaking out against<br>
programs that copy data from my computer without permission and transmits<br>
it over the network.  I also was speaking out against programs that<br>
misrepresent themselves as a different program to try to gain unauthorized<br>
access to other computers over the network.  You mistakenly assume that if<br>
I don't trust Microsoft to do anything it wants on my computer without my<br>
knowledge or permission, that I must have something to hide from them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for serving graphics incorrectly to Navigator, let me say the Netscape</i><br>
<i>&gt;Navigator is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;most unreliable pieces of software that I have ever used.[....]</i><br>
<p>
I never mentioned Netscape Navigator.  You mistakenly assume that if I have<br>
a single negative point about Microsoft Internet Explorer, that I must be<br>
anti-Microsoft and pro-Netscape in the browser arena.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for Wintel vs. Apple[....]</i><br>
<p>
I merely objected to your claim that Macintoshes are *twice* as costly as<br>
the equivalent PC.  You mistakenly assumed that I was therefore anti-PC and<br>
pro-Mac.  I tried to clear this up by pointing out that I have more PC's<br>
and Unixes in my home lab than Macs, and that I provide major consulting<br>
for IBM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's the biggest load of bullshit that I have ever heard. His mind is</i><br>
<i>&gt;brainwashed by the Rebel</i><br>
<i>&gt;Alliance.</i><br>
[....]<br>
<i>&gt;And last but not least, MS is a great company, honest. I have worked with</i><br>
<i>&gt;their guys on several</i><br>
<i>&gt;projects and I enjoy it everytime I do. They are extremely professional,</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfectionists, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have THE BEST coders I have ever run across in my entire life.  Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt;is aggressive and smart.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do any of us remember the mistake that Bill made about denouncing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet?  Now look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;their position on it, people are scared MS will take over.  Also, take a</i><br>
<i>&gt;look at how MS used kiss</i><br>
<i>&gt;Apple's ass. Apple had the potential to become what MS is today. It's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;about make good business</i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions.</i><br>
<p>
You are the one caught up in the propoganda.  Your entire post has been<br>
responding to points I never made.  You are having a war with an imaginary<br>
opponent.  I am not engaged in this argument, nor do I intend to be.<br>
