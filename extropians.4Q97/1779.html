<p>
Along the lines of a general theory of<br>
representations, it's interesting to note the recent<br>
Hayek-L discussion of Barry Smith's "The<br>
Connectionist Mind: A Study of Hayekian Psychology",<br>
particularly the distinction between propositional<br>
(pre-defined) and non-propositional<br>
(dynamically-derived) knowledge:<br>
"The whole resultant process is then not so much a<br>
matter of 'classification' as of 'evaluation' ...<br>
making distinctions of degree as well as distinctions<br>
of kind ... The map's job, from Hayek's perspective,<br>
is to facilitate a certain sort of cognitive laziness<br>
(or what Mach called 'thought economy') ... not,<br>
however that of a passive-memory storehouse, but of<br>
an active-memory competence ... It is remarkable how<br>
little explicit (conscious) knowledge is required by<br>
the agent in order for him to be able to react in<br>
appropriate ways to changes in his circumstances ...<br>
the most essential information is passed on in the<br>
form of abbreviated signals."<br>
(See<br>
<a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/faculty/smith/articles/HAYEK.HTM">http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/faculty/smith/articles/HAYEK.HTM</a><br>
)<br>
<p>
Joel Henkel's 971111 response to this essay may be of<br>
interest for the development of effective situational<br>
awareness representations: he notes that what we want<br>
are linkages that are represented "in a mode that is<br>
free from classes, signs or symbols ... a<br>
representation in kind" that uses a connotative<br>
rather than denotative association. <br>
(See<br>
<a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9711">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9711</a>&amp;L=hayek-l&amp;O=T&amp;P=3596<br>
)<br>
He is probably describing a theory of the human mind,<br>
but we may need something similar for societies of<br>
intelligent agents on the Net.<br>
<p>
In other words, rather than try to explicitly<br>
classify and rate millions of agents or sites, it<br>
would be better to implicitly capture the relations<br>
among agents in some semi-anonymous, statistical<br>
manner, much as price signals do in the material<br>
economy.  In short, the trick is to find some<br>
self-organizing mechanisms based on ubiquitous signal<br>
exchanges rather than rely on explicit rating schemes<br>
(although such could certainly be supplementary).<br>
<p>
Another reference I recommend (for theory) is Robert<br>
Pallbo's "Mind As Evolution and Evolution As Such"<br>
(see<br>
<a href="http://lucs.fil.lu.se/Abstracts/LUCS_Studies/LUCS34.html">http://lucs.fil.lu.se/Abstracts/LUCS_Studies/LUCS34.html</a><br>
) for its generic description of knowledge<br>
acquisition systems in terms of active components vs.<br>
preservative components, and retention vs. revival<br>
mechanisms, while defining the ways that variation<br>
and selection can be applied to such systems.<br>
<p>
While I'm still doing references, Mitchell Porter<br>
wrote about James G. Miller's Living Systems Theory.<br>
There is a paper by Chen and Gaines at<br>
<a href="http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~lchen/current/ijis/">http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~lchen/current/ijis/</a><br>
called "A CyberOrganism Model for Awareness in<br>
Collaborative Communities on the Internet" that uses<br>
Miller's theory as a foundation.  They have lots of<br>
other related papers one step up at<br>

Next, Sasha wrote:<br>
&lt; Multi-agent systems and action spaces &gt;<br>
<p>
Warning: the rest of this is just<br>
off-the-top-of-my-head stuff that may or may not be<br>
addressed in 'the literature' as I haven't done much<br>
research in this area.<br>
<p>
Is there a way to publish ones 'action space', e.g.,<br>
web browsing history, in an anonymous way but such<br>
that primitive net agents could access it, whenever a<br>
relevant search or send was initiated?  These same<br>
agencies must be able to accept feedback. <br>
<p>
&lt; I would envision the future intelligence as a<br>
collection of highly specialized tools, with<br>
high-bandwidth interconnections, with<br>
"personalities", or complex problem solvers<br>
("achievers", "goal engines", "research tools",<br>
"development threads") consisting of limited<br>
contractual relations between multiple<br>
problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting<br>
entities, that can at the same time be employed in<br>
many other similar relations. So the entities may use<br>
the same "body parts" on a cooperative or<br>
time-sharing basis. &gt;<br>
<p>
To me it seems that 'personalities' are the hardest<br>
part here. Perhaps this could be partially<br>
implemented by tracking my browsing history; better<br>
yet, a diary of my email filtering (saves vs. reads<br>
vs. skips) through some sort of semi-anonymous<br>
'signaling' that would enable personality indices and<br>
pointers to be prepared.  The trick, of course, is to<br>
find a way to implement this without compromising<br>
privacy too much.<br>
<p>
Sasha again:<br>
&lt; Unfortunately, while the economy provides its<br>
agents with accurate estimates of generic values, it<br>
has little to offer to each individual agent in their<br>
attempts to figure the value of a certain product to<br>
their particular needs, or offer any other<br>
personalized or situational advice. &gt;<br>
<p>
This is because each agent's utility functions are<br>
usually known only to that agent (and then only in<br>
some amorphous, embedded analog manner).  However, if<br>
my customized search agent knows my interests<br>
(according to some standardized classification<br>
system) and can report a history of my demands to<br>
other service agents, and all demands could be<br>
aggregated by some set of interest indices, then<br>
prospect-mining entities could queue up pointers for<br>
my type of agent (e.g., wants info on memetics), when<br>
I initiate a search, such agents could immediately<br>
recommend various threads (sets of URLs) and rate<br>
them according to my responses (at the most basic,<br>
whether I follow them or not).<br>
<p>
&lt; Among the first applications of this approach I<br>
envision large automated collaborative filtering<br>
projects, link exchange programs and targeted<br>
advertising, balancing flows of information in<br>
accordance with diverse and dynamic interests of<br>
creators, consumers, providers, and sponsors of the<br>
Web content. &gt;<br>
<p>
My favorite application would be a history of a<br>
browsing session - time-stamped, each link rated by<br>
duration of review, the extent of excerpts<br>
downloaded, any subjective evaluations explictly<br>
entered, automatically stored as a thread<br>
'somewhere'.  This seems to be a logical extension of<br>
the more 'unconnected' site rating that is (was?)<br>
available, e.g., with Firefly on Yahoo!  I tried this<br>
about a year ago and obtained a few good links but<br>
found that the biggest deficiency, aside from the<br>
effort required to rate a bunch of sites to get<br>
started, was that one could only rate sites that were<br>
in the database and there was no provision to add new<br>
sites on the fly.<br>
<p>
If the entities doing the browsing had already<br>
submitted some interest profile, then the recorded<br>
browsing thread could be classified and retrieved by<br>
similar agents when they commenced a related search. <br>
But, ideally we want a way to create the interest<br>
profile without any explicit effort on the inquiring<br>
agent's part.<br>
<p>
A payment mechanism is probably essential as an<br>
implicit rating system.  Once established, this<br>
'point of sale' data, tracking knowledge acquisition,<br>
could be fed into various indices of interest and<br>
intent that would drive the development of additional<br>
sources and services.<br>
<p>
Of course, until it becomes acceptable to charge<br>
(some small amount) for such value-added search<br>
services, and there is a secure, unobtrusive<br>
crediting mechanism in place, it is doubtful that<br>
resources to maintain such a service would ever be<br>
allocated.  I DON'T want to buy somebody's service<br>
'whole-hog' but I would gladly pay (if there's some<br>
kind of easy, one-click payment procedure) a few<br>
cents here or a dollar there for value-added hints<br>
and recommendations.<br>
<p>

<p>
P.S. I love the 'What's New' page on your site.  One<br>
of my biggest complaints about so many Web page<br>
providers is that they never think to date/time-stamp<br>
their entries.  Situational awareness in<br>
collaborative searches is exponentially enhanced by<br>
the availability of such chronological logs.  For<br>
example, a quick glance at it tells me that you just<br>
added the Hayek-L list to your Mailing Lists page, so<br>
I know you're probably aware of the "Connectionist<br>
Mind" essay I mentioned in the beginning.<br>
<p>
It's probably too much too ask that everyone take<br>
such care with their web sites or publish their<br>
'itinerary' for explicit viewing; but, it would be<br>
nice if anonymous delivery agents were able to track<br>
such information and somehow route information<br>
appropriately.<br>
