<i>&gt; Just wondering a few things myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Number one, why do you carry a gun.</i><br>
<p>
I don't carry a gun.  I will not say publicly whether<br>
or not I own any, but I will say that I have never<br>
carried a gun in public, openly or concealed.  I am<br>
a rather large fellow (6'3", 220 lbs), so I feel safe<br>
in most public places unarmed.  Petty thugs generally<br>
prey on the weak.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You mentioned that private ownership of a firearms reduces</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent crime.  I don't mean to jump on your case, but do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize that there would probably be a drastic reduction in</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent crime altogether if guns or any such weapon</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't even exist.  </i><br>
<p>
Argument from false premises serves no rational purpose.<br>
Weapons /do/ exist, so quibbling about what imaginary<br>
worlds might be like without them is a waste of time.<br>
Perhaps the existence of these technologies gave more<br>
opportunity for crime to some who might not otherwise<br>
have had that choice; but even if that is true, it does<br>
logically follow that removing the technology--if that's<br>
possible--will remove the effect.  Time moves forward,<br>
not backward; we cannot un-ring the bell.  Our job is to<br>
create /new/ technologies and /new/ social systems that<br>
work in the face of /real/ conditions, not to pine for<br>
imaginary worlds we will never see.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem with our society is we've slowly become so</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmed and so desensitized over the years we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; even think twice on the matters.</i><br>
<p>
I'll think twice when the gun banners can demonstrate to<br>
me that they are capable of thinking even once.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You say the fact that it was originated to "maim and kill"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is more or less outdated.  Well what is its purpose then?</i><br>
<p>
What I said was that such rhetoric as "designed only to maim<br>
and kill humans" served to perpetuate dangerous memes that<br>
make crime-inducing laws popular.  Of course guns are desinged<br>
to kill.  They are desinged to kill those animals and people<br>
whose death is regrettably necessary to preserve our own life<br>
and freedom.  Where there exist /effective/ non-letahal means<br>
of doing that, they are of course preferred.  But I won't<br>
hide my head in the sand and pretend that non-lethal means of<br>
defense are always sufficient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You look down on those who oppose the use of personal hand guns,</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying the laws passed to protect actually end up working against</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.  Sorry but I fail to see the logic in the statement that</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who fight against weapons have more blood on THEIR hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; than those who produce and use them.  Logic.  How can someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; has never touched a weapon have more blood on their hands if what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they had been pushing for had succeded, and there were no weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; to spill any blood to begin with.  Hello, get rid of guns all</i><br>
<i>&gt; together and imagine just how much more blood won't be spilt.</i><br>
<p>
People are to be judged by the rationally expected consequences of<br>
their actions, not their motives or desires.  To fantasize about a<br>
world without certain technologies is frivolous; such a thing can<br>
never happen.  The actions that /can/ happen are to create laws.<br>
The more gun-banning laws one votes for and supports, the more people<br>
die.  This is not supposition, there are decades of hard emiprical<br>
observations--look up the numbers yourself (the Cato institue study<br>
is one of the best recent ones).  Since the rationally expected<br>
consequence of passing a gun law /in our present state of technology/<br>
is that more people will die, those who vote for such laws deserve<br>
credit for those deaths, regardless of what they feel or want.<br>
Motives don't count.  Results count.  To answer your last sentence,<br>
it is not possible to "get rid of all guns".  Period.  To argue from<br>
such an impossibility is irrational.  What you might well be able to<br>
do is /ban/ all guns; i.e., pass a law against ownership of all of<br>
them.  If you did that, gun violence would indeed skyrocket, if the<br>
past experience with such laws is any indication.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about the tragic stories of...</i><br>
<p>
Trot out all the tear-jerking anecdotes you want.   Believe<br>
that I'm an uncaring ogre if you want.  I don't care what you<br>
believe.  I care what works.  I care about hard proof, not<br>
pretty stories.  If you want a defense anecdote for each of<br>
your tragedy anecdotes, I could probably come up with it, but<br>
it would serve no purpose.  It is the actual history of /all/<br>
uses of firearms that matters, and that history is very clear<br>
that on balance, guns have saved many lives for each one lost,<br>
and the history of gun control laws is a bloody disgrace.  If<br>
it makes you feel better to stay in denial about that, fine--<br>
just stay out of the voting booth, because your ignorance in<br>
there threatens my safety as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd hope, and I hope you would too, that we could come together</i><br>
<i>&gt; and solve our differenecs through logic, and intelligence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; compromise, rather than by shear force, death, and fear. </i><br>
<p>
Hope all you want.  But hope isn't much use against a dedicated<br>
agressor.  And neither is pretending that the agressors would<br>
go away if we just stopped making their favorite tools. <br>
