I would suggest that primitive sex evolved similarly to the way it is<br>
still done in bacteria.  Yes bacteria usually are asexual but on rare<br>
occasion they exchange genetic information in a process called conjugation<br>
in which "plus" (+) and minus (-) or positve and negative strands.  The F+<br>
or male has a plasmid that codes for a projectile (called a "sex pilus",<br>
really it is) that then penetrates the F- or female bacteria and initiates<br>
conjugation with an endonuclease that nicks one strand of the double helix<br>
of the F-.  The F- strand then adds this F+ strand DNA to her genome as<br>
she synthesizes a complementary strand. No courting. No romance :-(  oh<br>
well.  It's called  Rolling Circle Replication in the Biochemistry book I<br>
learned it from (Moran et al., 1994, ISBN 0-13-814443-5).  I think that<br>
our eukaryotic cellular structure is mostly or entirely explainable as<br>
symbiotic prokaryotic-types of cells working together.  Meiosis and<br>
"crossing over" is an eloborate "rolling circle replication" in my<br>
viewpoint.  This approach to chemical, prebiotic, protobiotic evolution is<br>
known as the endosymbiant hypothesis.<br>
