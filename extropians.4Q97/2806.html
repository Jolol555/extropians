The facts disagree.  After a little web-surfing, I found the following<br>
article.  It's from an anti-gun advocate organization, so you can argue<br>
that they have an agenda --- of course they have an agenda, but this<br>
little article is "just the facts", and the references they cite look<br>
impeccable.  It's from <a href="http://www.gunfree.inter.net/csgv/bsc_int.htm">http://www.gunfree.inter.net/csgv/bsc_int.htm</a><br>

   Basic Facts...<br>
<p>
   International Comparisons<br>
   ______________________________________________________________________<br>
<p>
   The murder rate in the United States surpasses that of every other<br>
   industrialized country in the world. The murder rate in Washington,<br>
   D.C. is fifteen times greater than that in Northern Ireland, a nation<br>
   plagued by terrorism.(9) This level of handgun violence does not occur<br>
   in other developed nations.  In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22<br>
   people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the<br>
   U.S.(10)<br>
<p>
   The number of young men killed in the U.S. versus the rest of the<br>
   world also is staggering.<br>
<p>
   In 1990, the homicide rate per 100,000 population for males ages 15 -<br>
   24 was as follows:(11)<br>
<p>
        Country         Rate<br>
        United States   37.2<br>
        Italy            4.3<br>
        Germany          1.1<br>
        Canada           0.9<br>
        United Kingdom   0.6<br>
        Japan            0.5<br>

My favourite sentence is, "In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22<br>
people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the<br>
U.S."  Think about that for a second (just one second should suffice)<br>
and then tell me again how the lack of handguns doesn't affect the<br>
peacefulness of a society.<br>
