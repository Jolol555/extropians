<i>&gt; I'm not sure this is the same copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario I was considering, since the original and the copy must share</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same thoughts and cannot diverge or be disconnected.  Wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing the original create a disconnection or a divergence in</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience that would raise the same objections?</i><br>
<p>
You mean, like one's dead and the other is alive?  That does seem a bit<br>
different, doesn't it? &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
I am assuming there is no afterlife, and so there is no experience of being<br>
dead.  Therefore there is no divergence, simply that one of them stops<br>
while the other keeps going.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only complication</i><br>
<i>&gt; with killing the original is that the only witness who would object to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the procedure is silenced, and there is no longer an original reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; with which to validate the copy.</i><br>
<p>
As long as the copy was in sync up until the moment the original lost<br>
consciousness, that's good enough for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This merely makes it harder to prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are not the same, but does not make the procedure any more</i><br>
<i>&gt; functional than if the original were allowed to live.  If the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; is allowed to live, you agree that the copy and the original are not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, if they are having different experiences.  They are the same up until<br>
the moment they become different.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you kill the original, I still maintain the same position,</i><br>
<i>&gt; only now the copy is the closest thing to the original now remaining.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that you would still exist in your original body.  You are just</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiencing a real-time simulation of what the copy is experiencing. </i><br>
<p>
We're slipping into saying what "you" are here.  Do "you" exist in (only)<br>
your original body, or are "you" defined by a pattern of information<br>
processing, irrespective of its time or place?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I disconnect the real-time update in preparation to kill the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original, wouldn't the original object that it has lost contact with its</i><br>
                                        /\<br>
                                      (know?)<br>
<i>&gt; second body and is now existing only in the original body?</i><br>
<p>
You must maintain the link until the original no longer has any conscious<br>
thoughts not shared by the copy.  If you disconnect the link and the<br>
original is still conscious, then he is now different from the copy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original have the same desire and curiosity to want to go continue</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiencing life?</i><br>
<p>
Again, you shouldn't have disconnected the link.  Now if you kill him his<br>
recent memories, experiences, etc. will be lost.<br>
<p>
Here is an interesting thought experiment, proposed last year by list<br>
member Lee Corbin, who was really into all these copying paradoxes.<br>
<p>
Imagine that you can push a button and erase the last 5 minutes of<br>
your memories.  You will instantly be transformed back into the mental<br>
state that you were in five minutes ago.  Now, you can make a case that<br>
this is effectivelly the same as the situation where you had a copy made<br>
five minutes ago, it has been suspended, and you can push a button to<br>
(instantly, painlessly) kill yourself and revive the copy.  In either<br>
case the last 5 minutes of your life are lost.<br>
<p>
How do you feel about this situation?  Would you be willing to push the<br>
button, or would it feel like dying?  Pushing the button will terminate<br>
your current stream of consciousness just like killing yourself.  The<br>
difference is whether the five-minutes-ago state will resume in your<br>
own brain or an identical duplicate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It almost seems that the copy argument for extending</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifespan focusses on continuing information and services to other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people.  If they do not perceive a change, the experiment is declared a</i><br>
<i>&gt; success.  It does not focus on information and services still be</i><br>
<i>&gt; provided to the original.  All such information and service is halted. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The original ceases to function, but none of his external contacts care.</i><br>
<p>
It's really not that.  It's all analyzed from the p.o.v. of the person who<br>
walks away from the experiment.  If he remembers everything that happened<br>
to all versions of himself, then nothing has been lost.  The changes<br>
were harmless; it's no worse than if he'd had all the atoms of his brain<br>
replaced but the neural function was maintained (which happens anyway<br>
over the course of years).<br>
