<p>
It's been shown that you can assume either that the number of points on the<br>
line<br>
is aleph-one or aleph-infinity and you'll get no contradiction.  It's much<br>
like Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry.  Most people work with the<br>
assumption<br>
that the number of points on a line = aleph-one = 2^(aleph-null), just<br>
because<br>
it makes the math easier.  This is called the "Continuum Hypothesis" (or<br>
axiom).<br>
<p>
That the Continuum Hypothesis can be assumed to be either true or false<br>
without<br>
trouble seems weird.  I conceptualize it by thinking that the number of<br>
points<br>
on a line is an ill-defined thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By this do you mean that there are B integers and 2^B points on a line, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;we don't know if there's anything in between?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think there's any cardinality between aleph-null and aleph-one.  <br>
If you assume the Continuum Hypothesis then there's nothing between the<br>
integers<br>
and the line.  If you deny it, then aleph-one, aleph-two, etc.  all come in <br>
between.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, where do aleph-null, aleph-one, etc. fit into all this?  My dictionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;says that aleph-null is "the first transfinite number".  Is that what you</i><br>
call<br>
<i>&gt;A?  If so, is aleph-one what you call 2^A?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  Aleph-two is 2^(aleph-one) and so on.  There's also an "extended<br>
continuum<br>
hypothesis" which holds that the number of all possible functions is<br>
aleph-two.<br>
I believe it's also undecidable but generally used because it makes life<br>
easier.<br>
