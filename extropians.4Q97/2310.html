PV pollution is a matter of the waste products of production. It takes<br>
quite a bit of pretty nasty stuff to make a solar cell.<br>
<p>
Electric vehicles are, in total, around 45% efficient on average, while<br>
Internal Combustion vehicles are 18% efficient, on average. This is a<br>
comparison of only the engine, power source, power train, and rolling<br>
and aerodynamic friction. When Power plant efficiencies are figured in,<br>
it comes out that EVs are on average 3 times more energy efficient, and,<br>
including power plant emissions, 33% cleaner than current IC technology.<br>
(of course, this fails to measure emissions of oil refineries, hint<br>
hint)<br>
<p>
Once this is determined, one then evaluates the economic value of these<br>
benefits, and weighs them against the drawbacks, like decreased range,<br>
speed, safety, and user time wasted waiting for charging, and the higher<br>
cost to purchase a vehicle. <br>
<p>
Personally, I think that if all a driver needs a car for is to commute<br>
50 miles or less each day (as is the case with 80% of American workers),<br>
then an EV makes sense. If one hopes to use a car for any recreational<br>
purposes, however, an EV is not a good idea. An EV may be a good choice<br>
for one vehicle in a two vehicle household for weekday carpooling.<br>
