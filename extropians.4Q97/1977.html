Umm... you're a plastic neural network.  It's a plastic neural network.<br>
It has received the same inputs you do.  After 20 years, it produces the<br>
same output you do.  The only differences between the two of you are that<br>
it probably started with a different structure (but yours was not<br>
genetically fixed, and the jewel is plastic, so it can change) and that<br>
you die faster than it does.  Not resemble you?  What the hell else<br>
would it resemble?  <br>

I haven't read _Permutation City_, although I've heard he pulls<br>
something out of his ass.  _Quarantine_ was interesting, much of<br>
_Axiomatic_ was really cool, and _Distress_ is looking good so far,<br>
although the climax is still out of sight.<br>

"The really ironic issue of late has been supercomputer exports. We now<br>
have the spectacle of William Reinsch saying that export restrictions<br>
on supercomputer *hardware* are unworkable because the technology is<br>
available all around the world.<br>
<p>
This is the very same Commerce official who still says with a straight<br>
face that export controls on encryption *software* are workable and<br>
desirable."<br>
