<i>&gt; Well, if you look at that aging disease that a few rare kids have, if</i><br>

<i>&gt; do some sort of rapid development, but I would think that the product of</i><br>
<i>&gt; such things would tend to be on the short side.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that works. Progeria makes aging faster, not development<br>
(otherwise the victims would grow up into adults instead of becoming<br>
"ancient dwarves"). While development can likely be speeded somewhat,<br>
it is probably hard to do with the entire body since many of the<br>
processes have to occur together but have very different timescales;<br>
think of lengthening of muscles and lengthening of bones. But speeding<br>
up individual tissues is probably quite easy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is also an outfit in Dallas claiming to be producing hot water</i><br>
<i>&gt; heaters using the same catalytic method as Pons &amp; Fleischman, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they can't claim that it's cold fusion because the patent office has</i><br>
<i>&gt; banned the use of the phrase (nice to see in our office of</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovation, eh?). Their drawings include a reactor about the size of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a shotgun shell, filled with pellets of the electrode materials,</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced by a proprietary method.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a fraud, since even if cold fusion does work it requires<br>
deuterium or tritium to work, and the amounts in ordinary tap water<br>
are likely far too small (~0.015%) to produce any noticeable heating.<br>
