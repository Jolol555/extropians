    The only thing Teflon about this topic is that my mind won't<br>
stick to it!<br>
<p>
    At first I thought it might be me.  Nope, it is just purposely written so<br>
as not be understood.<br>
<p>
    Please, author, just state the meat of it for me without the snide<br>
flourishes!<br>
<p>
    Bates (below) brings in the LaRouchian/Catholic Church theory of useless<br>
speculation.  I saw no hint of that in the Teflon topic.  Contrary to<br>
the ignorance or deceptions of LaRouche, speculation and, yes,<br>
derivatives play a useful role in the economy.  More speculation<br>
is necessary because of the prevelance of fiat money.   The<br>
fate of the numerous brands of fiat money is controlled by political<br>
manipulation (covert) about which the holders of assets can only<br>
speculate in an attempt to protect themselves.  Take away the<br>
monetary powers of the State and speculation would decrease<br>
though it is still necessary to deal with any and all sources of<br>
uncertainty in a free economy: weather, advancing technology,<br>
disease, disasters, future changes in supply/demand, etc.  More<br>
important than hedging against surprises, speculation creates<br>
the liquidity of markets that makes it possible to raise capital in<br>
a free society.  Who would put up a significant portion of their<br>
life savings for an investment unless they could be fairly<br>
confident of cashing it in on a moment's notice when their<br>
situation changed?  Without speculators, the investor would<br>
have to wait until someone else had the opposite needs, ie.<br>
is ready to buy what 1st investor needed to sell.<br>
<p>
    The Teflon Topic seems to be about the incredible growth<br>
of the non-working class under current policies, a non-working<br>
class that far exceeds the "can't work" class.<br>
<p>
    It is my view that this situation is not an accident, but one of<br>
the primary purposes of the Elite planners.   It is now a matter<br>
of faith among the environmentalists created and subsidized<br>
by the elite that the impact of humanity on the earth must be<br>
reduced.  Would you expect them to work toward full employ-<br>
ment?  No!  They purposely keep the barriers to productive<br>
enterprise high with their excessive regulations and taxes.<br>
Any Elite that wanted full employment would not allow an<br>
employment tax (!) in our case, withholding in the range of<br>
what (?) 23-40% !  The Elite would rather that large numbers<br>
of people languish in jail or on steet corners selling crack,<br>
or sit around waiting for a government pittance on the slightest<br>
excuse than have them be functioning at a more normal<br>
producing and consuming level.  It is easy to see that by<br>
bringing another 20-40% of the people into productive<br>
activity in a  free market would drastically increase the effect<br>
of humanity upon the earth!  The only other solution would<br>
be genocide!  That too, is on the agenda!<br>
<p>
    Actually, of course, "environmentalism" is just a smoke-<br>
screen for the real motives of the elite.  The most obvious<br>
hypothesis is that their primary attention is on maintaining<br>
their dominance of society.  The relative freedom of the<br>
19th Century convinced them that they start to lose control<br>
of the game when they allow thorough-going freedom and<br>
the resulting unrestrained economic-technological growth.<br>
New Dynasties arise to challenge the old under freedom.<br>
<p>
    Wouldn't that just be too bad!<br>
<p>
PS.  The writing of ruling class boot lickers Bertrand Russell<br>
and H. G. Wells, both pre-environmentalist give a closer<br>
glimpse of ruling class motives than the current flock of<br>
Court Intellectuals.  See Russell's _Prospects for Industrial<br>
Civilization_ for the most insights into pre-environmentalist<br>
rationale for opposing progress.<br>
<p>
    Woops!  I guess Wells was the bootlicker...Russell was<br>
actually a "Lord" though not very rich by most accounts.<br>
Damn industrialists had displaced his precious landed<br>
aristocrats?<br>

<i>|&gt; Dear Defenders of The Status-Quo:</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Let me remind you again of why this subject is justly called the Teflon</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Topic.  Two or three of us might agree that available empirical data from the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; UN and the World Bank shows the United States losing ground relative to the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; actual performance of other nations and our own true potential.  But, we will</i><br>
<i>|&gt; waste our time and effort, if we cannot formulate a model that makes both the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; data, and the principles that created the data, comprehensible to the public</i><br>
<i>|&gt; and acceptable to the American establishment. Without the establishment on</i><br>
<i>|&gt; the Lord's side, nothing gets better!</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; The serious search for a "General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money"</i><br>
<i>|&gt; ended when the founders of the American Economic Association, Richard T Ely,</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Henry Carter Adams, and others, from 1885 on, were given stiff doses of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; unemployment to teach them the politically correct way to teach Economics.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;  That is, by focusing their student's attention on the business cycle and</i><br>
<i>|&gt; other short term empirical effects; while ignoring the historical profile of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; such trend indicators as the Consumer Price Index (CPI),  ignoring the role</i><br>
<i>|&gt; of fixed and variable costs in determining the price of manufactured products</i><br>
<i>|&gt; in a free market, and thereby ignoring the financial structure of the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; corporation which must be replicated in the financial structure of the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; commonwealth according to such authorities as Adam Smith 1776, Thomas Paine</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 1797, John Stuart Mill 1848, and Henry Carter Adams 1887.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|BF&gt;Can you explain a little further how these authorities wished for the</i><br>
<i>|financial strucutre of the corporation to be implemented politically.  Is</i><br>
<i>|that not corporatism (i.e. Fascism)?  John Stuart Mill, Tom Paine, and</i><br>
<i>|Adam Smith wanted this?</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; This Teflon Topic is much like the calculus, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan</i><br>
<i>|&gt; explained the unique characteristic of that topic on page 89 of FAMILY AND</i><br>
<i>|&gt; NATION, 1986.  If the whole of economics is not taught in the schools, very</i><br>
<i>|&gt; few people will be able to re-invent it when they need it to do their job.  I</i><br>
<i>|&gt; certainly could not have re-invented it, I simply had my nose rubbed in</i><br>
<i>|&gt; "whole economics," in the oral tradition, by a fortuitous sequence of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; educational and on-the-job experiences.  And I cannot sit back and keep quiet</i><br>
<i>|&gt; while functionally illiterate "Alpha Apes" propose public policies that will</i><br>
<i>|&gt; eventually put the United States at one with the late great Soviet Union.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; That 72 year old result of human design, not human action, collected 92% of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; the 1986 budget of the USSR from indirect taxes (sales, VA, excise, etc.) on</i><br>
<i>|&gt; its corporations and only 8% of the 1986 budget from direct taxes on personal</i><br>
<i>|&gt; incomes.  This tax data tidbit is from page 63 of a document entitled,</i><br>
<i>|&gt; SEVENTY YEARS OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT, 1987, Novosti Press Agency Publishing</i><br>
<i>|&gt; House, translated from the Russian by Boris Lunkov, with an introduction by</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Mikhail Gorbachev.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Without a technically valid conceptual model of society to inform his</i><br>
<i>|&gt; judgment, Gorbachev was in the same boat with the American students which</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Allan Bloom described in his 1987 book, THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;  Like Henry Carter Adams one hundred years before him, Professor Bloom</i><br>
<i>|&gt; addressed all of the symptoms of our social pathology without digging quite</i><br>
<i>|&gt; deep enough to identify the root-cause of the English Disease.  And Saul</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Bellow did not dig any deeper in the foreword.  We can forgive H. C. Adams</i><br>
<i>|&gt; for not disclosing the optimum financial structure of a corporation or a</i><br>
<i>|&gt; commonwealth, the technology was not available to him in 1887.  Should the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; public conclude then, that our intellectually gifted people are making so</i><br>
<i>|&gt; much money from writing and talking about our social pathology that they</i><br>
<i>|&gt; won't disclose the technically valid model to the public until Hell freezes</i><br>
<i>|&gt; over and the Devil has them by the neck?</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Before we set out to hang one social scientist each day, until the survivors</i><br>
<i>|&gt; confess the technically valid concept of a corporation or commonwealth, let's</i><br>
<i>|&gt; assume they are innocent until they convict themselves out of their own mouth</i><br>
<i>|&gt; by denying the model after the public understands and accepts the principles</i><br>
<i>|&gt; of the model.  The exact time of arrival of that improved condition of public</i><br>
<i>|&gt; understanding cannot be predicted.  But it must arrive eventually, if the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; process of diffusion of information among a free people has not been</i><br>
<i>|&gt; completely obliterated by New Age Thinking as described by French author</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Raymond Aron in his 1957 book, THE OPIUM OF THE INTELLECTUALS.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Those principles of the model are:</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 1, The expense of developing a productive asset (capital or human) must be</i><br>
<i>|&gt; completely invested before the asset can be brought into production.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;  Consequently, the asset cannot bootstrap itself into production and is</i><br>
<i>|&gt; dependent on an external investor.  This principle explains why Evolution</i><br>
<i>|&gt; takes so long and Creation theory still has a following.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 2, The total and continuing expense of developing all English speaking</i><br>
<i>|&gt; productive assets was assumed by the commonwealth when the Elizabethan Poor</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Law of 1601 was enacted.  Since 1601, the only topic of discussion in English</i><br>
<i>|&gt; has been:  Does it matter whether that fixed expense is charged to the family</i><br>
<i>|&gt; budget or to the public revenue?</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 3, In his 1974 book, FROM POOR LAW TO WELFARE STATE, Walter I. Trattner</i><br>
<i>|&gt; reminds us in 362 well written pages of how completely we have subsidized</i><br>
<i>|&gt; society's criminals, its poor, its insane, its deformed, its useless, and its</i><br>
<i>|&gt; elderly.  But, there is no feedback from these unfortunate elements of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; society to the overall performance of society.  They are simply a burden</i><br>
<i>|&gt; which society carries out of human kindness.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 4, It is the 132 million productive members of American society, the work</i><br>
<i>|&gt; force, together with the dependents they support, which social scientists</i><br>
<i>|&gt; must study to re-discover the optimum financial structure of a corporation or</i><br>
<i>|&gt; commonwealth.  If the unfortunate elements enumerated in # 3 above were to</i><br>
<i>|&gt; die of natural causes, or be shipped to Australia, the 132 million productive</i><br>
<i>|&gt; members of society would breath a sigh of relief and scarcely miss them.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 5, You say that 132 million variables are too many to handle with your</i><br>
<i>|&gt; limited knowledge of mathematics on your small computer.  Not so!  Any ten</i><br>
<i>|&gt; year old can handle more variables than that on a few sheets of 8.5" X 11"</i><br>
<i>|&gt; paper by plotting the variables as an Input/output "scatter diagram" with</i><br>
<i>|&gt; linear X, Y, scales and a Z, axis measuring Frequency of Occurrence" of the</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 132 million productive assets.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; 6, Granted that education of society's children is as certain as the subsidy</i><br>
<i>|&gt; of society's criminals, its poor, its insane, its deformed, its useless, and</i><br>
<i>|&gt; its elderly; there remains only the question:  Is the performance of a</i><br>
<i>|&gt; society significantly affected when a public expense similar to 5% of GNP,</i><br>
<i>|&gt; similar to the DOD budget, is imposed on households as a head tax at the rate</i><br>
<i>|&gt; of $5,000/year/dependent?</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Any ten year old who can read the numbers in the current World Bank ATLAS</i><br>
<i>|&gt; knows that the distribution of the tax burden in each country has</i><br>
<i>|&gt; significantly affected the performance of producers at the lower levels of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; income in each nation while being scarcely noticed at the higher levels of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; income.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>
<i>|&gt; This Teflon Topic really should be on your agenda, not on mine.  After all,</i><br>
<i>|&gt; I'm one of the retired elderly, living on your production, thanks to your</i><br>
<i>|&gt; human kindness, and affecting nothing at all as far as I can see.</i><br>
<i>|&gt;</i><br>

<i>|&gt; P.S. My recent e-mail mentioned another symptom, not the root-cause, of what</i><br>
<i>|&gt; ails us.  As long as our public men talk only about the symptoms, we will</i><br>
<i>|&gt; continue to sink deeper into the Status-Quo!</i><br>

<i>|&gt; The late great Soviet Union had complete government control of the issue of</i><br>
<i>|&gt; currency and credit for 72 years, a massive sales tax, practically no</i><br>
<i>|&gt; personal income taxes, and nobody learned anything from the 72 year</i><br>
<i>|&gt; experiment.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|BF&gt;Has anyone learned anything from Fascist economics?  How can a</i><br>
<i>|"corporation" be a valid model for a free society?  All talk of "English</i><br>
<i>|disease" or liberal economics aside, simply look at the strucutre of a</i><br>
<i>|corporation and understand that under such a structure there is no</i><br>
<i>|freedom or unapproved mobility.  If your economic agenda, which seems to</i><br>
<i>|be a kind of attempt to stimulate production at the cost of useless</i><br>
<i>|speculation and consumption, works, then by definition it works at the</i><br>
<i>|expense of something.  Am I wrong to suggest that, to an extent, useless</i><br>
<i>|speculation and consumption are symptoms of a free society, and that</i><br>
<i>|English disease can, if injected in the right amount, innoculate us from</i><br>
<i>|more serious plagues?  My humble opinion.</i><br>
