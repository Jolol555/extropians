Dan Clemmensen, &lt;Dan@Clemmensen.ShireNet.com&gt;, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Wait a minute. I thought that Godel proved that any sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex set of axioms (i.e., sufficient to use as a basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyday mathematics) was provably incomplete or provably inconsistent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A consistent system is one in which there is no statment which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; both provably true and provably false. A system that is complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; can prove that any statement in the system is either true or false.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's trivial to prove that this implies that there are an infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of undecidable statements in the system. Further, you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose to generate an infinite number of new consistent systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; by adding one of the undecidable statements as a new axiom. So,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you like the Continuum Hypothesis, and it is provably undecidable</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the accepted axioms of set theory, you are free to create a</i><br>
<i>&gt; new consistent system by adding the CH as an axiom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How am I supposed to go from this to Penrose's conclusion? Sounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; crazy to me.</i><br>

It would be better for someone who is more familiar with Penrose's argument<br>
to say whether I have accurately described it.  However I think the idea<br>
here is that we aren't supposed to be just playing with formal systems<br>
when we do math.  We are seeking after truth.<br>
<p>
The mathematics we create is intended to accurately represent the<br>
behavior of abstract mathematical objects which we are thinking of,<br>
such as the points and lines of plane geometry, or the integers under<br>
the rules of arithmetic.  We set up axioms which are intended to<br>
caputre all the relevant properties of these objects.  "Truth" in this<br>
context means that the axioms accurately describe the mathematical<br>
objects we have in mind.<br>
<p>
We have to go outside the axiomatic system to determine the truth of a<br>
proposed axiom.  We have to fall back on our general reasoning power,<br>
persuasive arguments, looking at the conclusions which flow from different<br>
assumptions, and seeing if they seem plausible.  It's almost more like<br>
political argument than the kind of logic we associate with mathematics.<br>
<p>
I just skimmed Penrose's book, but my impression is that he claims that<br>
mathematicians have an instinctive ability to recognize mathematical<br>
truth.  Machines, which are deterministic computer programs and therefore<br>
can be in principle be described as formal systems, are limited by Godel's<br>
theorem and are unable to recognize certain truths.  Since people are<br>
(according to Penrose) unlimited in their ability to recognize mathematical<br>
proof, this would mean that they are not formal systems and therefore no<br>
machine can do mathematics in the way a person does.  (And hence, among<br>
other things, uploading and AI are impossible.)<br>
<p>
In the case of the CH, as I quoted from Rucker's book there has not been<br>
a killer argument made either way.  It could be that our understanding of<br>
infinities is so poor that choosing the axiom one way or the other will<br>
both produce mathematics which seems OK.  The properties of the infinite<br>
objects will be different, but either one could fit into our sloppy<br>
mental model of how an infinite object should behave.  If so this would<br>
seem to contradict Penrose's premise.<br>
