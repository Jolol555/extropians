This might have already been covered in the infinities thread,  it seems<br>
I came into this mailing list a bit late.  If this tidbit has already<br>
been covered, please accept my apologies and ignore this message.<br>
<p>
Awhile back I read an article in some magazine that I can't remember -<br>
maybe it was a MENSA thing (eep, the M-word!), maybe Popular Science, I<br>
don't know - but it was on this new concept called Surreal Numbers. <br>
Now,  at the time, I was just learning about _imaginary_ numbers,  so<br>
the thought that numbers could be surreal was something I liked to think<br>
about from time to time, but never got into - no one could teach me but<br>
myself.  Anyway,  it seems that some mathematics theorist was coming up<br>
with all these crazy notions about numbers such as infinity + 1, and was<br>
calling them surreal numbers.  Has anyone else heard of such a thing or<br>
is my memory playing tricks on me?<br>
