<i>        &gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Brian D Williams thinks censorship is moral, </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Brian D Williams &lt;talon57@well.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Brian D Williams thinks no such thing, Brian D Williams is provoking         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;discussion by playing Devils advocate. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then somebody is using your name, somebody claiming to be Brian D Williams  <br>
most definitely did say:<br>
<p>
 "I tried for a number of years to interest the NRA/ILA to propose a simple  <br>
  law based on this fact. I proposed that the law ban the depiction of guns,  <br>
  or there use, on TV and in the movies."<br>
<p>
Obviously working on a project for a number of years goes way beyond Devil's <br>
advocacy, so the message must be a forgery, you really should start signing <br>
you posts with PGP to prevent this sort of thing in the future.<br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;I'll just ignore your threat.</i><br>
<p>
If you interpreted anything I said as a threat then I apologies.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;such a law has nothing to do with guns, it has to do with speech </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;and the inability of government to convince people to do what they </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;want. The only solution these gangsters can think of is to use force </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;to stop citizens from hearing the other side of the argument.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It has everything to do with gun violence, which is a learned </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behavior. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's no different than anything else, everything is a learned behavior, the <br>
only reason anybody censors anybody about anything is to get people to do <br>
what they want.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The gangsters you refer to, are in my opinion, the major television </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and cable networks which have written policys against running </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anything which might put gun ownership or use in anything except a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;negative role.  </i><br>
<p>
What's wrong with that? I wouldn't like people saying things I don't agree <br>
with on my network either. If you don't like their policy then start your own  <br>
network, it's never been  easier technically. Of course nobody will watch if <br>
you have nothing to say.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The major networks are not encrypted to the curb, much less the home, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;so your argument fails completely.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
They are not encrypted because at the present time there is no reason to do <br>
so, but you must know the categories of broadcast TV, the Internet, telephone, <br>
and cable are starting to blur. The strong trend is to treat them all the <br>
same way, as bits of information, massive censorship would accelerate the <br>
trend. The only way to stop it is to destroy all private computers and<br>
dismantle the internet. Unlikely.<br>
<p>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;As someone else already pointed out CNN has a written policy to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;this effect, as does CBS, the others you mentioned are rumored to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;as well. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I misunderstood, I thought an " anti-gun policy" was something that would <br>
change network content, that is, I thought the words meant something.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Don't believe it? try running an NRA commercial during prime time..</i><br>
<p>
Is that all you mean by an "anti-gun policy, not a law "banning the depiction  <br>
of guns"?<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;You choose to call what he did after "a perfectly honorable         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;profession" (acting), I call it hypocrisy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you're a good person and an actor and play the part of Hitler in a movie, <br>
does that make you a hypocrite?                 <br>
<p>
