The question isn't whether he's popular, but whether he's right. When<br>
people first suggested that humans were descended from apes their<br>
position wasn't very popular, and that situation seems very similar<br>
to the current antipathy to the idea of humans being pretentious<br>

Three-dimensional in your conscious mind? You mean there's a 3D<br>
strawberry inside your head? Presumably this means that noone can<br>
ever perceive an elephant or whale, since the 3D qualia wouldn't <br>
fit? And could you point to a qualia, because I'd really like to<br>
see one?<br>

A statement which, frankly, tells us absolutely nothing about <br>
anything... except your belief that you understand how your<br>
brain works. As a scientist I like to have some evidence for<br>
theories, and you aren't providing any.<br>

Yes, it's a database entry.<br>
<p>

<p>
You assert. Now can you give us some evidence?<br>
