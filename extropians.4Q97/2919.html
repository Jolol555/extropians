<i>&gt; On Nightline tonight, they were discussing future technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including uploading via neuron replacement and evolving AI.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They showed some cool video of what appeared to be evolving</i><br>
<i>&gt; GAs in a "real" 3D environment. This was the first time I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen that, and unfortunately I didn't catch the person's name</i><br>
<i>&gt; who had done it. Basically they started with a simple organism</i><br>
<i>&gt; composed of two cubes, and let it evolve into successively</i><br>
<i>&gt; more complex organisms based on how well they could "swim"</i><br>
<i>&gt; through the simulated environment. The result looked very</i><br>
<i>&gt; similiar to a sperm cell :-)</i><br>
<p>
Very interesting!  One problem with such simulations though is that<br>
sometimes they are "cooked" so that a particular outcome is more or less<br>
inevitable.  There may be implicit constraints on the types of forms the<br>
genetic algorithm can evolve, and the authors will have been careful to<br>
set things up so that a sperm-like shape would be one of the possible<br>
outcomes.<br>
<p>
Could they take that same simulation, make the fluid thinner (like<br>
air) and change the fitness function to evolve something that flies?<br>
That would be a test of whether they had a good general model of evolution<br>
or just a toy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I couldn't help but think about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities should a 3D Cyberspace ever replace the web-</i><br>
<i>&gt; would it become possible to evolve AIs by letting them grow</i><br>
<i>&gt; and learn within such a system?</i><br>
<p>
Theoretically, other "geometries" for cyberspace would not preclude the<br>
evolution of AIs.<br>
<p>
I've been reading Dan Simmons' science fiction series Hyperion recently.<br>
(I can't really recommend it overall because much of it is terribly<br>
violent and sad.)  He has an AI society called the TechnoCore which at<br>
first I assumed was an outgrowth of 21st century AIs.  However later<br>
in the series he claims that it actually evolved out of alife parasites<br>
like our computer viruses and worms.<br>
<p>
The problem with this idea is that it is hard to see how or why alife<br>
would evolve intelligence.  Current viruses are about as smart as natural<br>
viruses, probably.  And it's not clear how much it would help them to be<br>
more intelligent.  If you added today's AI technology into a virus, like<br>
a fuzzy logic based expert system to choose a strategy for infiltrating<br>
a new computer, it would probably not be successful.  The virus would<br>
become so bulky that it would be hard to remain undetected.<br>
<p>
Maybe in the future things will change, computers becoming so big and<br>
sloppy that smarter alife can find a niche.  Then it may be possible to<br>
see a real form of alife evolution where it smartens at least in the<br>
biological sense, where a bacterium can be considered quite "intelligent"<br>
in its adaption to its environment.<br>
