Oooh!  Can I just point out that while I generally loved this movie,<br>
<p>
ALL 5 PEOPLE i went to see it with, as well as all three critics<br>
<p>
I've read review it, were happy to note that they felt the message<br>
<p>
of the film was an affirmation of faith [without evidence]!<br>
<p>
<p>
Aargh!  Sagan wrote an entire book (The Demon-Haunded World), and spent<br>
<p>
much of his career warning of the dangers of this.  Skepticism and<br>
<p>
reason, as well as a profound distrust of organized religion and similar<br>
<p>
superstitions, formed such a large part of his body of work.<br>
<p>
<p>
Although Sagan had a heavy hand in the film, around 80% was filmed while he<br>
<p>
was on his deathbed, and another 10% was filmed AFTER he died.  It makes<br>
<p>
me crazy to think the film people managed to make a film espousing the<br>
<p>
REVERSE of Sagan's message, while still loudly proclaiming him imprimatur!<br>
<p>
<p>
Argh!  Ooeerg!  [teeth gnashing]<br>
<p>
<p>
The book was much more clearly pro-logic.  Joss was a much less loathable,<br>
<p>
pretty-boy character.<br>
<p>
<p>
And the book had one fascinating idea which was inexplicably (okay, the<br>
<p>
film people correctly thought it was too complicated for mainstream audiences)<br>
<p>
omitted from the film: PI contains a "secret message" from the (non-divine)<br>
<p>
alien creators of the universe.<br>
<p>
