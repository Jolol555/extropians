In a message dated 97-10-23 15:33:37 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 The federal government is the landlord of the <br>
 property known as the United States. The rules<br>
 of the landlord  must be followed or penalty<br>
 is effected.  It is not coercion so long as <br>
 you are free to leave the U.S. property if <br>
 you have a problem with the contract. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I've a problem with this...two things...<br>
<p>
One...who gave the federal government the property?  Did they buy it?  Did<br>
they steal it?  Are you saying that theft is ok and confers ownership as long<br>
as it happend yesterday?<br>
<p>
Second thing...since the theft is an accomplished fact...then it ok as long<br>
as you can leave your wordly possesions in the hands of the theif and leave?<br>
 Your money or your life?<br>
<p>
