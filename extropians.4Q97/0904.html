Congratulations, you have just rediscovered the beanstalk (aka orbital<br>
tower) and the rotovator! <br>
<p>
Start with a satelite in geosynchronous orbit; it will orbit the earth<br>
in 24 hours, which means that it will always stay over the same place<br>
(that is the definition of the geosynchonous orbit). Suppose you<br>
lowered a long string from it; it would obviously hang straight down,<br>
over the same spot of surface all the time. This is the idea of a<br>
beanstalk; you simply connect your satelite in geosynch orbit with the<br>
ground by a strong cable, and add a counterweight cable with (say) a<br>
tethered asteroid beyond ao that the whole system remains stable.  Of<br>
course, the cable needs to be rather strong, but buckytubes seems to<br>
be a real possibility.<br>
<p>
The rotovator is a cable that rotates around the earth (its center of<br>
mass is in a circular orbit) with a period of rotation that is a<br>
rational multiple of its period of orbit; if implemented properly the<br>
ends will drop down into the atmosphere almost vertically, slow down<br>
to zero local velocity for a short while, and then move out again.<br>
