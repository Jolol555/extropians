To the extent that widespread gun ownership promotes freedom, then there<br>
is a positive externality to gun ownership in the form of maintenance<br>
of a free society.  Someone who does not own a gun obtains an external<br>
benefit from their neighbors who own guns.<br>
<p>
To the extent that guns are more efficient at killing than other weapons,<br>
there is a negative externality as well.  Someone who does not own a gun<br>
is potentially at increased risk of being killed when their neighbors<br>
are well armed, should one of them have an accident or become irrational.<br>
