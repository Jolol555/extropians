<i>&gt;I thought CDs used a fairly high bandwidth, on the order of</i><br>
<i>&gt;44K bytes per second per channel? If so, your radio bandwidth must</i><br>
<i>&gt;get a lot cheaper to support this application. Also, it's supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be illegal to build gear that delivers the raw binary from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;audio CD: only the analog waveform is delivered from your player,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I thought. This is why you have that silly extra wire connecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;your CD-rom drive to your sound card to play audio CDs. All in all</i><br>
<i>&gt;you are probably better off using a DAT tape to copy the CD.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
CD audio is actually 88kbytes/channel ( 2-bytes/sample * 2 channels * 44100<br>
samples/sec = ~176kbytes/sec ) or slightly less bandwidth than a T-1 line.  <br>
<p>
However, radio broadcast standards are 32000/samples per second per<br>
channel.  Additionally, FM broadcast audio has a signal to noise ratio of<br>
no more than 60dB (usually less), or roughly equivalent to 10-bits/sample<br>
instead of the 16-bits/sample for Red Book audio.  Using non-linear<br>
encoding you could probably fit that into 8-bits/sample.  Degrading the<br>
source signal to the level just described should produce sound that is<br>
indistinguishable from quality FM broadcast, and could fit in about 30% of<br>
the bandwidth space of CD audio.  It should be noted that the frequency<br>
spectrum and resolution specified for CD audio requires a minimum of 1500<br>
ft^3 of non-reflective space for accurate sound reproduction (i.e.<br>
expensive car stereos are a waste unless you own a convertible).<br>
<p>
As for pulling raw audio off a CD, I've seen it done, but the software<br>
requires low-level access to the hardware.  If your drivers don't support<br>
it, you probably can't do it easily under most operating systems.<br>
