<i>&gt; &gt; it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have made a better product.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not to mention more capital than exists anywhere in the computer industry </i><br>
<i>&gt; except at Microsoft.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And of course "someone" will have to include full Microsoft backwards </i><br>
<i>&gt; compatability, which probably entails including the last version of </i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows with your shiny new operating system.  Oops! That means that </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft still wins, doesn't it?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I suspect that backward compatibility will be one of the<br>
major things that cripples MS, and one of the reasons Linux has failed<br>
so miserably to be the contender.  When consumers start realizing that<br>
small smart $20 products can accomplish their needs without the great<br>
edifice of MS-DOS 7.1 (aka Windows 98) or the outrageuously bloated<br>
X/Motif, or the process overhead of Unix, the limited application base<br>
of new systems will matter less and less.<br>
<p>
What will matter in the coming decades are communication standards,<br>
data organization, and latency (assuming we manage to stay ahead of<br>
the legislature fast enough to accomplish these things).<br>
<p>
WARNING, POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT:<br>
<p>
Along those lines, I'd like to point out that West Publishing<br>
has successfully purchased Congressman Coble, who has introduced<br>
HR 2652, the "Collections of Information Anti-Piracy Act".  This<br>
act basically allows West publishing to claim ownership of the<br>
text of court opinions your taxes paid to produce and West has<br>
collected.  To be clear, this is not talking about West's own<br>
annotations which they already have copyrights on, or access to<br>
their databases which they already control, but the actual text<br>
of the court opinions themselves, which we have already paid for.<br>
It in currently in committee.<br>
<p>
The bill is probably unconstitutional under Feist v. Rural, but<br>
since its language echos that of international treaties such as<br>
the WIPO charter, it's possible that it will be found valid under<br>
treaty despite the constitutional defect.<br>
