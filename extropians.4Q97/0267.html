NSPIC relates to a dimension of freedom unknown<br>
to practically all freedom lovers and freedom<br>
activists -- conservatives, libertarians,<br>
objectivists, anarchists, neo-tech owners, etc.<br>
<p>
A few days ago, John French sent me this:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"If you can avoid it, never play on the other guy's field, by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other guy's rules, or with the other guy's ball.  He didn't design</i><br>
<i>&gt;_his_ system to give _you_ the advantage.  Remember that organisms</i><br>
<i>&gt;defending their own territory are twice as effective as an intruding</i><br>
<i>&gt;attacker." -- L. Neil Smith</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The best thing each of us can do is withdraw our support and</i><br>
<i>&gt;change our whole attitude.  I think this is best accomplished</i><br>
<i>&gt;by getting a "divorce" from the system, mentally and physically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;starting by dumping mind-numbing abstractions.  You are on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;right track. -- John French</i><br>
<p>
Physically "divorcing" yourself from coercive<br>
political systems I call the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom.  That's not what this message is about.<br>
<p>
This message is about *mental* and *intellectual*<br>
"divorce" from coercive political systems.<br>
This is the field of NSPIC -- the Neuro-Semantic<br>
Political Illusion Complex.  NSPIC consists of<br>
a combination of "mind-numbing abstractions" and<br>
illusions that together keep coercive political<br>
systems in place at the most basic level.<br>
<p>
At the most fundamental level, most freedom<br>
activists actually help keep coercive political<br>
systems in place by reinforcing and spreading<br>
the basic "mind-numbing abstractions" and<br>
illusions on which the power of coercive<br>
politicians and bureaucrats depends.<br>
<p>
At the most basic level, many freedom activists,<br>
in the words of L. Neil Smith, "play on the<br>
other guy's field, by the other guy's rules,<br>
or with the other guy's ball."<br>
<p>
George Orwell penetrated just through the skin<br>
of NSPIC -- the combination of "mind-numbing<br>
abstractions" and illusions that keep political<br>
systems in place -- in his classic '1984.'<br>
<p>
Sy Leon, in 'None of the Above,' penetrated a<br>
little deeper through the skin of NSPIC.<br>
<p>
I don't know if Harry Browne, having written<br>
the Introduction to 'None of the Above,' has<br>
much of an inkling of NSPIC.  (Though, in<br>
communicating to the masses, he has to talk<br>
as if he knows nothing about NSPIC, in order<br>
to be effective.)  The NSPIC "mind-numbing<br>
abstractions" and illusions are at a deeper<br>
level than all the "government myths" exposed<br>
by Harry Browne in 'How I Found Freedom in an<br>
Unfree World.'<br>
<p>
Robert Ringer, in 'Restoring the American Dream,'<br>
in Chapter 8 -- "Keeping It All in Place" --<br>
penetrated deeply into NSPIC, but stoppped short<br>
and didn't follow through.<br>
<p>
No other freedom authors I know of seem to have<br>
even an inkling of NSPIC -- the combination of<br>
"mind-numbing abstractions" and illusions that<br>
keep political systems in place.<br>
<p>
Understanding and overcoming NSPIC will give<br>
you an empowering perspective of yourself and<br>
show you a "soft spot" or weakness of coercive<br>
political systems you most likely have never<br>
even suspected.<br>
<p>
Mastering NSPIC will provide you with vastly<br>
more powerful options for dealing with coercive<br>
politicians and bureaucrats and their systems.<br>
John French told us above to "change our whole<br>
attitude."  In mastering NSPIC, you will be<br>
amazed and delighted by how your attitude<br>
changes for the better.<br>
