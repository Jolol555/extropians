Very true. Whatever we are doing, we do not know what we do. Even worse,<br>
given process' dynamics (climatic history gleaned from palaeoice records<br>
do not forebode well) it will be too late when we have arrived at an<br>
informed consensus. In fact the argument that at our current level of<br>
technology the sustainability of progress can be assured for only a few<br>
decades (estimates vary, but you got my meaning) should be a major pro for<br>
an R&amp;D bost. Singularity imminent or not, thin-film photovoltaics and<br>
electrochemical forms of energy storage should range very high on the<br>
international agenda. Singularity may be delayed, or it may be altogether<br>
a comforting myth. We are risking too much here, imo. <br>

Yes. Whatever we should be, we should not be complacent, we bipedal<br>
primates with our rich snafu tradition. <br>
