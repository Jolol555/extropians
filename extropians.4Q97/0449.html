<i>&gt; From: Natasha V. More (fka Nancie Clark)</i><br>
[SMTP:natasha@extropic-art.com]<br>
<i>&gt; The most recent Extropy Investment Group met this past Tuesday =</i><br>
evening<br>
<p>
Natasha, just out of curiosity, could you share with us your target<br>
annual growth rates?=A0 I myself have found it fairly straightforward =<br>
to<br>
make 40% annual returns over, say, a 5 year period, as long as one is<br>
willing to ride out a few ups and downs.=A0 I'm curious as to what =<br>
other<br>
extropians see as viable investment targets and strategies.<br>
<p>
For the record, my next strategy (as yet untested - awaiting capital) =<br>
is<br>
simple:<br>
<p>
1) Pick a nascent industry with a potential for stellar growth in the<br>
next 20 years. (E.g., biotech, space exploration, nanotech).<br>
2) Identify the 10-20 market leaders.<br>
3) Research and weed out those that seem to be on the verge of =<br>
collapse,<br>
while promoting those with good strategic assets (good research<br>
staff/connections, key patents, etc..)<br>
4) Divvy up your funds among the 10 or so stocks.<br>
5) Hang on tight for a decade or two, making the minimum possible =<br>
number<br>
of stock transactions.<br>
<p>
My favorite hidden feature of this strategy is that most of your income<br>
is essentially tax-deferred.=A0 Why?=A0 Because stocks in a nascent,<br>
high-growth industry are growth stocks.=A0 Thus your return on =<br>
investment<br>
is in the form of higher stock prices.=A0 Stock price gain is taxed as<br>
capital gains rather than income.=A0 Capital gains tax is only due when<br>
you sell the stock.=A0 Thus rather than losing 30% of your earnings =<br>
each<br>
year (and having that compound over a decade), you only lose the =<br>
capital<br>
gains rate at the very end.<br>
