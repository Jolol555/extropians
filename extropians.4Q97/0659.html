Hey, Uncie Doug!<br>
<p>
I don't know if you remember me, but I'll just reintroduce myself anyway --&gt;<br>
I'm Derek Strong, fka Derek Ryan, and we met at my old home in Phoenix (the<br>
"Phoenexus," where I lived with Ralph Whelan and Tanya Jones at the time you<br>
visited).  We also hung out at Extro2 somewhat (and got kicked out of more<br>
than one room together for partying too enthusiastically).<br>
<p>
Anyway, if you don't remember me, I'm sure you remember Ralph and Tanya.<br>
I'm the hyper, charismatic, generous, wealthy, suave, intelligent, funny,<br>
short-but-nonetheless-large roommate of theirs (though I may have been<br>
living with Rhonda while you were visiting us).  I'm getting in touch just<br>
because I saw your recent post to Extropians and thought it'd be good to<br>
keep our fledgling tendrils of association alive and well.<br>
<p>
In particular, I wanted to let you know that Ralph, Tanya, I, and our two<br>
new housemates Matt Day and Kip Repscher have all moved to Silicon Valley<br>
recently.  (FINALLY!)  Here's our new info, if you care to make a note of<br>
it:<br>
<p>
833 Gary Ave.<br>
Sunnyvale, CA 94086<br>
(408) 737-8703<br>
<p>
(This address puts us just a five minute walk away from the ExClave (Dave,<br>
Geoff, and Romana's).)<br>
<p>
Email for Ralph, Tanya, and Derek, respectively:<br>
<p>
hplar@primenet.com<br>
tanya@molly.org<br>
derek@zhmort.com<br>
<p>
I don't know where you go and what your travel schedule is like this days,<br>
but I'll just go ahead and make clear again that you are always welcome to<br>
stay with us any time you're in our area, and of course everyone would love<br>
to hear from you any other time, as well.<br>
<p>
Hope you're having fun!<br>
<p>
Derek<br>
