I was thinking more along the technological and business lines. He<br>
predicted cable media, malls and superstores, etc. and if you think of<br>
how much more "progressive" the tax system is now compared to then, as<br>
well as the current moves to allow workers to choose between income or<br>
time off for overtime work, as well as universal retirement at 65 (since<br>
there was no such thing as retirement back then), its pretty prescient.<br>
I still thought his political propaganda inthe book was pathetically<br>
naive and typical of the touchy feely justification of socialistic<br>
policies that liberals are always pushing today.<br>
