I think an increase to $95.00 for ExI membership is entirely reasonable<br>
for all the reasons already<br>
posted.  I really want a strong and viable institute, an institute able<br>
to make its ideas and visions<br>
heard around the world.  I could care less if Max were able to cruise<br>
around in a Merc, as long as the<br>
ExI is fulfilling its mission.<br>
<p>
I might add when the time comes for additional fund raising, as I am<br>
sure it will.  It would be helpful to advertise<br>
a specific need or project.  Its always more motivating to know of a<br>
tangible need.  As an example, the Foresight Institute had a fund raiser<br>
for new computer targeted for a specific purpose.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
