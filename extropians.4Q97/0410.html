Sigh.  I don't even find that aesthetically pleasing.  I certainly<br>
don't find it useful.  As a matter of fact, it seems counterproductive,<br>
even destructive (insofar as moods and attitudes affect longevity and<br>
productivity).<br>
<p>
If you're going to use oversimplified formulae, how about:<br>
<p>
Love life now!<br>
<p>
or:<br>
<p>
If you don't like your past, change it.             [perspective]<br>
If you don't like your present, change it.          [attitude]<br>
If you don't like your future, change it.           [planning and execution]<br>
<p>
or:<br>
<p>
The past is what you make of it now.<br>
The present is what you make of it now.<br>
The future will be what you make of it now.<br>
<p>
That will do for now.<br>
<p>
Quibblings over the precision of these statements will be D'd --<br>
they're not meant to be precise.<br>

Hugs all 'round,<br>
