<i>&gt;instinctive from non instinctive? If differentiation is not a principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;actual definition, why is there more than one word in a language system?</i><br>
<i>&gt;To be sure, if you feel the need, you can arbitrarily call all urges</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive to support the belief, "instinctive objective values" if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;wish, but it disregards the objective differention that actually exists. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The definition I gave of the term, instinct, which excluded volition, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;consistent with the principles I explained as required for actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition. You did not challenge this criteria, but simply dismissed it out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of hand with the word, "irrelevant". You have aroused my curiousity. Do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;see any need to connect your word arrangements to objective reality? If not,</i><br>
<i>&gt;why not? If so, by what reference criteria do you presume to do so?</i><br>
<p>
Your definition, while consistent with differentiation, is not accurately<br>
descriptive of the phenomenon of instinct. In defining instinct as<br>
non-volitional reaction, you are not defining instinct; you are defining<br>
non-volitional reaction. You choose to select a definition that does not<br>
describe the actual phenomenon, because it tends to support your position.<br>
Word games.<br>
<p>
Instinct is inborn knowledge, skills, and values.<br>
<p>
We feed, protect, and nurture our offspring because we instinctively feel<br>
that the alternative would be morally wrong. That is the true nature of the<br>
phenomenon that virtually everyone but you calls instinct.<br>
