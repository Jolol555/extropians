Western Europe!?!?!?! you've got to be kidding! I've got relatives<br>
there that still have Soviet Tank tracks on their Lawn!!!!<br>
<p>
Well actually you probably consider that eastern Europe, but the<br>
western countries all still have militaries and armed citizens to<br>
some degree, perhaps you missed the recent post from one of our<br>
Dutch members?<br>
<p>
Canada? Last time I checked you still had a military, not to<br>
mention armed citizens, not to mention a rather large  and<br>
extremely well armed neighbor to the south. If you think thats got<br>
nothing to do with it, you're only kidding yourself.<br>
