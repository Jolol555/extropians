I'm sorry I don't remember the details, but the problem with long-term<br>
parenteral<br>
feeding is not nutritional deficiencies.  The problem is that dumping the<br>
foods<br>
directly into the bloodstream disturbs one of the fundamental balances - <br>
acid/base, osmotic, electrolyte; I forget which.  Long-term, either you have<br>
to<br>
starve the patient (not enough calories) or you will kill them by deranging <br>
their body chemistry.  It's not the food content, it's the intake mechanism.<br>
<p>
People can and are maintained indefinitely on elemental diets, in which all<br>
food<br>
is synthetic.  We don't know enough to maintain optimal health indefinitely,<br>
but<br>
we can manage adequate health with just the nutrients we know about.<br>
