In a message dated 97-11-19 06:16:31 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;And octopi.  Take an octopus who has never seen a glass jar.  Put a <br>
<i> &gt;lobster in a glass jar with a screw-on lid -- an ordinary mayonnaise </i><br>
<i> &gt;jar will work if it's a small enough lobster.  Toss the jar in with </i><br>
<i> &gt;the octopus.  Within about five minutes, the jar is open (not </i><br>
<i> &gt;broken, open) and so is the lobster.</i><br>
 <br>
 I've seen this on TV.  It does show that they have a lot of potential.  (I<br>
 wonder<br>
 how many humans would pass?:)  It would also be exciting to uplift them<br>
since<br>
 they are so different from us.  I imagine the ideas/experiences they/we<br>
could<br>
 share would be fantastic/near-mind-shattering to us/them.<br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Octopi also have a very advanced/evolved communication system, lighting up<br>
their skin with patterns.<br>
