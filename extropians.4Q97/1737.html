      John Clark fails to notice that he does first what he then accuses me of.<br>
  <br>
      I tell the truth, and document it, and argue critically and rationally.<br>
<p>
      John responds to good-faith writings by a 'veritable vocabulary of <br>
      denigration' -- trying to label people as 'crackpot' and so on;  and <br>
      his only purpose in doing so is an ad hominem abuse of hypotheses <br>
      and indeed _facts_ which he dislikes.  He defends orthodoxy.<br>
<p>
      I take great exception to this -- 'Extropians' is supposed to be an <br>
      intelligent 'flame-free' venue...  John Clark owes me an apology.<br>
<p>
      If I flame John, he'll *burn*...<br>

      John Clark tries to labek me dismissively as a 'crackpot': am I?<br>
<p>
      I tell John Clark (again) that I suffer partial disability from Post <br>
      Traumatic Stress Disorder, which I experience due to my defending <br>
      what John Clark _professes_ to believe in.  At times, it's no fun at <br>
      all...  Perhaps I shouldn't have bothered, eh?  "Never volunteer..."<br>
<p>
<p>
      My most recent clinical psychiatric assessment states:<br>
<p>
      [A]  That I'm a really nice person;<br>
<p>
      [B]  That I'm brilliantly intelligent;<br>
<p>
      [C]  That I'm perfectly sane; (not 'a crackpot' of any kind);<br>
<p>
      and -- worst of all --<br>
<p>
      [D]  That I suffer tremendous _situational political stress_.<br>
<p>
  <br>
      That's why I've applied for _Political Refugee status_ in Canada; <br>
      and why my application is being supported by the top level of the <br>
      Criminal Intelligence Division.  There is no better authentication.<br>

      "Cet animal est mechant -- quand on l'attaque, il se defend!"<br>
<p>
      Sure, I'm 'vicious' -- when I'm attacked, I _defend myself_.  Gosh!<br>
<p>
      The 'mind-to-firing' relays [Cordwainer Smith, remember?) can <br>
      respond with _devastating retaliatory effect_.<br>

<i>&gt; Despite Tony Hollick's attack on the memory of a very great man I honestly </i><br>
<i>&gt; wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and put him in the amusing </i><br>
<i>&gt; category, and when in the middle of a muddled description of quantum mechanics </i><br>
<i>&gt; he started to rant about flying saucers, false teeth, and electrically powered </i><br>
<i>&gt; roller skates I thought there was real hope</i><br>
<p>
      That's _right_.  I'm working to provide us-all with some _hope_.<br>
<p>
      As General Dan Graham (late Director, the Defense Intelligence <br>
      Agency) writes in my -- personally inscribed -- "High Frontier" <br>
      Project Book [1982], published under the aegis of the Heritage <br>
      Foundation: p. 95, "Economic Effects of Renewed Hope":<br>
<p>
      'With all the attention devoted in recent years to perceived <br>
      scarcities of clean air, clear water, petroleum, natural gas, <br>
      strategic materials, investment capital, and government funds, we <br>
      have barely noticed that the most critically scarce commodity of all <br>
      has been "hope."'<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  but then he said this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "I don't think much of Hawking's ideas.  Look what his mind did to his poor   </i><br>
<i>&gt;   body...  Would you want that to happen to you?" </i><br>
<p>
      [ FX: "Impending sense-of-humour failure in Quad L-14!" ]<br>
<p>
      The genre is 'black humour.'  Hawking would appreciate it, I'll bet.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Suddenly I stopped laughing and knew which category to put Mr. Hollick into.</i><br>
<p>
      F**k your 'categories.'  Who gave you the right to put other people <br>
      in your crummy little 'categories'?  If what you think you 'know' <br>
      were really so, for all that I know you could be _dead_ by now. &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      [ FX: "Show us!!!" ]<br>
<p>
      [ FX: "Watch the TV news carefully this next week..." ]<br>
<p>
<p>
      Think about it.  And please don't be so goddamn humourless next time.<br>
<p>
      OK?<br>
