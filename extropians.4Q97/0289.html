I am looking for substantiation of something I've heard that may turn out<br>
to be a "hundred monkeys" fabrication. On the other hand, if true, I think<br>
it may have a bearing on my research into history and moral philosophy.<br>
Details available after I've done more homework...<br>
<p>
The story goes that there are two cultures of killer whale, genetically<br>
indistinguishable (i.e., one species) but with no cross-breeding evident:<br>
the pelagic, ocean-roaming, husky-eating, kayak-tipping "wolf pack" variety<br>
and the Puget-Sound-local, salmon-eating, laid-back "Shamu" variety.<br>
Allegedly, they speak two *different "languages"*, too.<br>
<p>
Can anyone here tell me how controversial this notion is among ethologists<br>
and marine biologists?<br>
Is it generally accepted? Is it thoroughly discredited? Who espoused it?;<br>
who shot it full of holes?<br>
Is it just an "urban legend"? I crave facts and cites. Tomorrow I'll start<br>
digging in earnest--but tonight, I thought I'd cast my question to this<br>
eclectic bunch...<br>
