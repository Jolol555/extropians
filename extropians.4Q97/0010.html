Yes I read it ! maybe I just missed that part, I'll read it again<br>
But I was referring to the "actual" start-up, like Anders Sandberg<br>
took it. So you just "wake-up"? I thought there had to be a "pulse"<br>
from outside, something like what they do, when someone's hart<br>
has stopped ( a bit like flatliners, or so )<br>
<p>
BTW: the site were the article is  www.merkle.com<br>
<p>
Thanks again for the help !<br>

Greetings,<br>
