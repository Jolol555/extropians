                               <br>
The concept, morality, is probably the most popular topic of<br>
conversation in the world.  Wherever one turns, one is inundated<br>
by talk of morally right, or moral rights, or the complement,<br>
morally wrong, or immoral, but I don't suppose anyone claims<br>
"immoral rights"; at least, I haven't heard of any doing so. All<br>
in all, there are a lot of words flying about on this subject<br>
with some rather strong emotions often attached. The problem is<br>
this airborne dialogue on "morality" seems to stay airborne,<br>
which puts me to wondering just what the hoopla is all about.<br>
What's all the rhetoric attached to? Why do some feel the need to<br>
"justify" their actions? And "justify" by what?  It appears that<br>
the Extropian List has its fair share of "moralist", so maybe<br>
someone can help me out on this.<br>
<p>
I understand cause and effect, that all actions have<br>
consequences. I understand that consequences to my liking I call<br>
good, and those I do not like, I call bad.  Does not every<br>
individual do the same?  I hear "morally right" and "morally<br>
wrong", but it fits not in my thinking. I can grasp right as<br>
proper means suited to a specific purpose. By the same token, I<br>
can grasp wrong means for a specific purpose. But purpose is a<br>
matter of individual choice is it not? So, is a "moralist" simply<br>
saying that what is suited to his purpose is called moral and<br>
that which is not is called immoral? If not his purpose, whose?<br>
Or what's? Can we have "good or bad" without purpose?<br>
<p>
There are those that say that what is according to "God's will"<br>
is moral; that which opposes is immoral. Alas, it appears that<br>
"God's will" is a diverse thing and the differences of opinion<br>
follow suspiciously along individual lines. One might say that it<br>
is immoral to eat a hot dog while another disagrees, but holds<br>
that it is moral to exterminate all non believers. Thus does<br>
"good and evil" cover a wide "moral and immoral" range" of<br>
differences. <br>
<p>
Then there are those who consciously and verbally dismiss such<br>
mysticism as "God's will", yet cling no less tenaciously to the<br>
idea of morality than the most devout believers in formal<br>
religion. When pressed for an answer to the question of reference<br>
for claims of moral or immoral, they are at a loss to provide it.<br>
Some say that which is consistent with life is moral; that which<br>
is inconsistent with life is immoral. This leaves a lot of<br>
questions unanswered. If one is talking about just bare survival,<br>
there still remains the question of personal choice. Beyond this,<br>
choices, decisions and actions  comprise an active life. To just<br>
say that "life" is a standard not only denies personal choice,<br>
but totally ignores the elements that make up an ongoing life. To<br>
prepare a list of "moral or immoral" things and attempt to<br>
validate such a list is venture that many include in their daily<br>
routine.  Thus by inference do they fall right back into the<br>
mysticism of "God's will" and a set of "oughts" for one and all.<br>
The "oughts" and "shoulds" fill the air and air seems to be their<br>
only filler, for "ought" is recognition of "not is", and the<br>
twain shall never in reality meet. <br>
<p>
The issue can be illuminated by a simple observation and a brief<br>
question or two: The terms, good and bad, have no definitive<br>
meaning except in the evaluation of means in respect of a<br>
particular end. Suited or unsuited is the question that answers<br>
the question, good or bad. So how does this "morality" stuff get<br>
into the picture?  Is the particular end by individual creating,<br>
or is it a claim of discovery existing independently of<br>
individual creating? If the former, then all individuals and<br>
their ends chosen are no less viable. All arguments of "morality"<br>
are pointless.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if it is claimed the end reference purpose for<br>
"moral" or "immoral" is discovered outside of self or<br>
independently of any individual, whether the alleged source is<br>
called "God", "Nature", whatever,  is immaterial. A purpose<br>
existing independently of individual creating necessarily implies<br>
a volitional source existing independently of individual. Thus<br>
one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or<br>
concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim<br>
the former. Although not named and often vehemently denied, this<br>
leaves the latter, i.e, the concept, superior being, as the root<br>
of "morality."  From the concept, superior being, comes the<br>
concept, inferior being. This is inevitably followed by<br>
subordination and rule. Since history books and daily newspapers<br>
tell of the horrendous consequences, I need not elaborate here. <br>
<p>
To be sure, the idea of the "innate evil of man" in need of<br>
redemption and external control by "non man" is deeply embedded<br>
in the psyche of nearly all. In denial of this belief, they are<br>
hard put to explain the feeling of fear at the thought of leaving<br>
an individual to his choices and own devices. Thus do they pursue "moral<br>
control" for the sake of "security" in a never ending self-<br>
fulfilling prophecy of death and destruction. Do not the facts<br>
bear out this conclusion?  An "unquestionable" sacred idea built<br>
on illusion may be emotionally comforting, but it is often quite<br>
deadly. <br>
<p>
If I have erred in my deliberations and calculations, please<br>
point out the wheres and whys of the flaws and I shall be<br>
grateful.<br>
