I would qualify that with "..._some or most_ cosmologists..."<br>

<p>
OK, let's go over these -- knowing full well most of us -- including me --<br>
are not<br>
experts.:)  Doesn't this contradict your initial statement?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An open universe is just as intuitively pleasing - if only</i><br>

<i>&gt;fact have some degree of linearity.</i><br>
<p>
On that last point, yes.<br>
