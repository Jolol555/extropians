<i>&gt;</i><br>
I'm no historian, though I doubt this tale.  My guess is the rails,<br>
roads,<br>
etc. could have been privately built, but that it was easier to steal<br>
money (i.e., tax) from other people than to raise it privately and the<br>
relevant industries were politically connected.  Also, nationalism was<br>
beginning to rear its head at the time, and the idea of protecting<br>
industries had never really been dislodged.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;And if we'd let the Georgian and the German beat on each other for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;a few more years, before we intervened? We might have been rid of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;both of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Possibly, but the number of citizens killed in that war might very well</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have been larger, also you run the risk that one of 'em (say Stalin) wins</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and takes over all of Europe. Had the allies been 3 weeks later, Stalin</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;would have rolled his tanks all the way to the Dutch-German border, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;maybe the Northsea.</i><br>
<p>
Let's not get too caught up in this.  If the West, including the US<br>
govern-<br>
ment, had not given aid -- food and money -- to the Soviets during the<br>
1920s or loans to the German government during the same period, the<br>
chances of WW2 would have been lessened.  The chances of the<br>
Soviets staying in power, or of extending that power to Central Asia --<br>
after the Russian Civil War, they reconsolidated the Central Asian<br>
provinces -- would have been slim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Most law enforcement *is* at the individual level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;You have locks on your doors, no?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Wiil a lock be enough? The only way to prevent criminals to enter my house</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and loot the place (Yes, certain things I own are important to me) would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to live in a fortress or to have some kind of weapon to discourage them. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;don't much like the first option and the alternative would lead to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;personal arms race between me and anybody that I think might want to hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;me. I gues you know the argument... I see no way out of this.</i><br>
<p>
If this arms race scenario is valid, why don't countries do it all the time?  <br>
And when they do, why do they usually fail?  The Soviets, e.g., armed<br>
themselves to the teeth, and by doing so, set off a balancing reaction<br>
which basically isolated them.  They were surrounded by enemies<br>
until the end -- from Western Europe to Turkey to China.  Relevant<br>
reading here is _The Origins of Alliances_ by Steven M. Walt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'm not even going to make a long case about such a society being quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;conquered by a society that didn't abolish the cetralised state (and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;has a large, heavily equipped army).</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I think the centralized state, and not local law enforcement,<br>
is the biggest problem for an anarcho-capitalist society.  Of course, my<br>
solution is space colonization.  If we can expand away from states at<br>
the speed of technology, then they might become irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;As I remember it, groups of people long ago tried to fix this problem by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;forming clans and agreeing to not fight among themselves and spare there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;energies for any external threat. Soon thereafter they made wall around</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;their encampments and called it a city. Then someone thought that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;would be even safer if they worked together with another city (of course if</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the other city didn't agree battering rams became the tools of the argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;- I agree with you infofar that this is a far cry from perfect, political</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;solutions seldom are).</i><br>
<p>
I don't recall this happening to form any modern nation state.  The<br>
history of states seems to reduce to the history of states fighting<br>
or conquering each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think you'd want to abolish these groups and take your chances whereas</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people like Joao Pedro and me what to extend the group to every human on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the planet and take our chances won't turn on us. We're both taking risks</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(jump in here Joao, if you feel I'm misinterpreting your posts).</i><br>
<p>
If there are enough groups, then the chances of a planet-wide coalition<br>
forming to destroy you and me are even less than, say, Saddam<br>
Hussein sending troops to conquer California.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Thanx! this is most usefull, I'll try to get hold of some copies (and find</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the time to read them ;-).</i><br>
<p>
I would add Murray Rothbard's _For a New Liberty_ to the list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I just don't see that states in general (altough most of them are rotten to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;various extends) are so destructive compared to the expected performance of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;alternatives. But maybe we speak from different perspectives and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experiences.</i><br>
<p>
Was it two anarchocapitalist protection agencies which invaded Poland<br>
in 1939?  Was it a group of libertarians who oppressed Ireland for<br>
centuries?  And which private group tried to exterminate the Armenians<br>
less than a hundred years ago?  (These are just a few examples, and<br>
they aren't even the worst.  Even the best of states is pretty bad.<br>
just do't pay your taxes, flaunt it, and find out.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Problem remains how you can garuantee in any way that these institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;don't become the instruments of dictators or some such (without any form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;democratic control).</i><br>
<p>
Democracy is dictatorship of the majority.<br>
<p>
Live life!<br>
