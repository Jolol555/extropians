<i>&gt; &gt; Date: Sun, 21 Dec 1997 00:57:20 -0500</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; From: "L. Neil Smith" &lt;lneil@ezlink.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Subject: Please Pass It On ...</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;     People accuse me of being a single-issue writer, a single-issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thinker, and a single-issue voter, but it isn't true.  What I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chosen, in a world where there's never enough time and energy, is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; focus on the one political issue which most clearly and unmistakably</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; demonstrates what any politician -- or political philosophy -- is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; made of, right down to the creamy liquid center.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [....]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Makes voting simpler, doesn't it?  You don't have to study every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; issue -- health care, international trade -- all you have to do is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; use this X-ray machine, this Vulcan mind-meld, to get beyond their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; empty words and find out how politicians really feel.  About you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And that, of course, is why they hate it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ignoring the argument about guns, I find this attitude frightening and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultish.  Ignore all fact, don't do any research, just make all your</i><br>
<i>&gt; decisions based on a single binary question.  At lease religious</i><br>
<i>&gt; fanatics have to interpret their beliefs.  This sort of commandment</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires no thought at all.</i><br>
<p>
What, because it doesn't allow the voter to be hypnotized by meaningless<br>
BS? It really doesn't matter what issue you think of. Ask them what they<br>
think about pot legalization, or the right to take vitamins, or the<br>
right to expose oneself to all of the nastiest pornography one can find<br>
on the internet. The reason he uses this is because a) since the 2nd<br>
amendment IS a part of the constitution, and a well defined part at<br>
that, if the elected representative has already sworn to defend and<br>
protect the Constitution in his previous inauguration, then he either a)<br>
is lying to you when he/she says they are against guns, or b) made a<br>
fraudulent statement when they swore their oath of office. If he or she<br>
is a newbie, and signs a pledge to oppose the 2nd amendment, then they<br>
could be sued for making a false oath when they are sworn in. This is<br>
actually rather briliant, and I am surprised that this issue has not<br>
been raised in court to fight the election of anti-gun representatives.<br>
