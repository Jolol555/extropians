<i>&gt;Anders Sandberg gives a calculation of the thermodynamic efficiency of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;dyson shell in his (draft) Jupiter Brain paper, and concludes that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;smaller dyson shell is more efficient than a larger one. But I think his</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasoning is slightly flawed. I'll show that the reverse is true, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;dyson shells may have a much lower temperature than previously thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;(see for example</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dysonFAQ.html#LOOK">http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dysonFAQ.html#LOOK</a>) which may</i><br>
<i>&gt;explain why they have not yet been observed. Previous temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt;estimates assume that the energy captured by dyson shells is also used up</i><br>
<i>&gt;(dissippated) by them. </i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However it</i><br>
<i>&gt;turns out that the effect of the cosmic background radiation is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;noticeable until we get to a radius of about 100 AUs. Ignoring the cosmic</i><br>
<i>&gt;background radiation gives us Tl~=(S/(4*pi*r^2*sigma*Th))^(1/3). At 1 AU</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is 161 K with efficiency of 97%, and at 10 AUs this is 35 K with</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiency of 99.4%. At 100 AUs, and taking into account cosmic background</i><br>
<i>&gt;radiation, Tl is 7.6 K with efficiency of 99.87%.</i><br>
<p>
My (educated) guess is that a Dyson sphere would show up as a very strange<br>
looking object in the sky surveys such as IRAS, COBE, DIRBE (Diffuse<br>
Infrared Background Explorer) satellite datasets. It would be especially<br>
strange signal in the infrared: if one knew the object's distance very <br>
well based on visual magnitude, but then found that its IR flux gave a <br>
whopping signal compared to what you would expect.<br>
<p>
The new temperatures that you gave, based on thermodynamic efficiencies,<br>
are actually terrestrial dust temperatures. Those are the sort of <br>
temperatures you would find for dust around infrared excess stars.<br>
(I have a little bit of text about infrared excess stars at<br>
<a href="http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html">http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html</a>)<br>
<p>
For example, the four brightest infrared excess stars are <br>
alpha Lyr, alpha PsA, beta Pic, and eps Eri. Those four have <br>
dust temperatures (micron-sized dust around the star) of 85K, 60K, 110K, and <br>
50K, respectively.<br>
<p>
So I don't think that something like this would be invisible to<br>
our current instrumentation.<br>
<p>
However, I hope that someone is working with some of the better<br>
datasets to look further for Dyson spheres. For example, the<br>
Hipparcos data is publically available now, so one can use that<br>
for finding positions of stars much more accurately than known before.<br>
And the ISO, IRTS and other infrared observatories should give one better<br>
infrared fluxes than the early-80s IRAS data.  People who are looking<br>
for planets (there is a mission under study now called the "Terrestrial<br>
Planet Finder"), are already considering many of these issues,<br>
that is, how to detect signatures of cool dusty material and other unsual<br>
things around a star.<br>
