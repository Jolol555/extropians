<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Well, if we were to erroneously assume that the moon is the same size it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  always was, and that the earth has expanded due to accumulated</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meteoroidal material, then we would need to have accumulated material to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be 750 miles deep over the entire surface. This comes out to an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  accumulation rate on average of one tenth of an ince every decade. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt;  total new soil generation on earth averages  one inch per 30,000 years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  coming from all sources, including erosion of existing rock, I find this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  figure highly specious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Since we know that the moon has accumulated material at a far faster</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rate than the earth, due to its higher angular velocity allowing it to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sweep through more space than the earth while taking advantage of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  earth's greater gravity well as an attractor of material, we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  conclude that the only time in earth's history that the moon may fit</i><br>
<i>&gt;  into a tetrahedron large enough to fit inside the earth, is sometime far</i><br>
<i>&gt;  into the future, so long as the sun doesn't go nova first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No not at all, the earth has been expanding due to matter from the inner core</i><br>
<i>&gt; being moved into the mantle, (the inner core is 3 times as dense as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mantle)...(well im not sure if its the inner or outer core, or a process of</i><br>
<i>&gt; both) which happens at a far faster rate than soil deposits on the earth or</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon.  Im referring to the study (sorry no references, Ill ask some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; and try and find out) that concludes that if you fit the continents back</i><br>
<i>&gt; together again into the original land mass, the only way they'll fit properly</i><br>
<i>&gt; is if the earth was 80% of the size that it is now.  And since the moon</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesnt have a hot mantle (well, im not sure if it did back then though, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesnt seem like it) it would have been approximately the same size (maybe a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mile smaller due to the meteoric impacts you were talking about).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; danny</i><br>

Danny, Danny, Danny, think first. The earth is cooler now than it was<br>
billions of years ago, right? Its no longer molten all the way through?<br>
So due to contraction of cooling it should be smaller, right? NOT<br>
bigger. I also thought I had explained to you that the fact that the<br>
existing contintents being only so much area means absolutely nothing<br>
with regards to the size of the earth, as well as that there is no way<br>
the earth could expand due to material from the core moving out.<br>
Material flows in and out all the time, and the density is merely due to<br>
the gravitationally induced pressure of the weight of all the mass in<br>
the outer layers pushing in. By your logic, the earth should be smaller<br>
since the outer layers have been pushing against the core for billions<br>
of years, so they must have compacted it down more. (Y'know, like why<br>
your cereal settles down in the box over time).<br>
