EvMick asks<br>
: But would someone mind expanding upon the "Nolan" Chart as mentioned earlier?<br>
: It sounds vaugely familar to something I heard years earlier...."The<br>
: Pournelle Political Matrix" in which the dicothomy "Right / Left" is<br>
: expanded into more precise..and two dimensional  definition...<br>
<p>
Pournelle's chart is more theoretical: its axes are statism and<br>
belief in the possibility of accurate social engineering.  (Which<br>
are not the same thing!)<br>
<p>
The Nolan Chart is more pragmatic: its axes are "Personal Freedom"<br>
(sex, drugs, the draft) and "Economic Freedom" (minimum wage, taxes,<br>
licensing).  Used with the "World's Shortest Political Quiz", which<br>
some have criticized for its quick'n'dirty selection of questions<br>
which may tend to overestimate the number of libertarians.<br>
<p>
(Dave Nolan is a founder of the LP.)<br>
<p>
I once met someone who objected to the Nolan Chart because it's square<br>
and a hexagon is a more natural shape!<br>
