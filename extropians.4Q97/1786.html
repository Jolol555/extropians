<i>&gt;I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail &amp; I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hello!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time</i><br>
accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my<br>
account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same<br>
e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject</i><br>
line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going<br>
to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand,<br>
there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly<br>
mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine<br>
a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading<br>
the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my</i><br>
P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up<br>
an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am<br>
stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial</i><br>
downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40%<br>
down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared</i><br>
to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your<br>
money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to<br>
be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an<br>
envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your<br>
way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy<br>
it is.  If I can do this, so can you!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                       GO FOR IT NOW!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                       Karen Liddell</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.</i><br>
<i>&gt;PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may</i><br>
ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to<br>
generate large amounts of cash.  This program is showing fantastic appeal<br>
with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional<br>
income.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require</i><br>
you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you<br>
never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the</i><br>
easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true!<br>
When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program<br>
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thousands of people have used this program to:</i><br>

<i>&gt;    -  Pay off debts</i><br>
<i>&gt;    -  Buy homes, cars, etc.,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    -  Even retire!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is your chance, so don't pass it up!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY</i><br>
<i>&gt;ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Basically, this is what we do:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing</i><br>
to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our<br>
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state<br>
in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your<br>
computer).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The products in this program are a series of four business and financial</i><br>
reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will<br>
include:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  * $5.00 cash</i><br>
<i>&gt;  * The name and number of the report they are ordering</i><br>
<i>&gt;  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!</i><br>
The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing<br>
business anywhere!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND</i><br>
<i>&gt;BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is what you MUST do:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you</i><br>
don't order them).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE</i><br>
<i>&gt;        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR</i><br>
<i>&gt;        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person</i><br>
<i>&gt;        whose name appears on the list next to the report.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;        can save them on your computer and resell them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will</i><br>
<i>&gt;        be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people</i><br>
<i>&gt;        who will order them from you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed</i><br>
<i>&gt;     next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way</i><br>
<i>&gt;     other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you</i><br>
<i>&gt;     will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you</i><br>
<i>&gt;     understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;     work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and if you alter it, it will not work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the one that was there down to REPORT #2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         REPORT #3.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         REPORT #4.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction</i><br>
<i>&gt;     portion of this letter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another</i><br>
<i>&gt;     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you</i><br>
<i>&gt;     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send</i><br>
<i>&gt;     out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because</i><br>
<i>&gt;     they can't advertise until they receive the report!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$</i><br>
<i>&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
-----------------------<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume</i><br>
your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a<br>
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also<br>
assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline<br>
members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1st level--your 10 members with</i><br>
$5...........................................$50<br>
<i>&gt;2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500</i><br>
<i>&gt;3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                                   THIS</i><br>
       -----------&gt;$55,550<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit</i><br>
10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people<br>
to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can</i><br>
afford $20). You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is<br>
FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing<br>
and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on<br>
trade!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;About 50,000 new people get online every month!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the directions accurately.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the orders start coming in because:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested</i><br>
<i>&gt;    product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections</i><br>
<i>&gt;    255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;    exchanged for money received."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,</i><br>
continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should<br>
receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue<br>
advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for<br>
REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and<br>
the cash will continue to roll in!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of</i><br>
a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which<br>
report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income,<br>
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is<br>
no limit to the income you will generate from this business!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business</i><br>
name,                  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local<br>
office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help<br>
and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free<br>
help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially</i><br>
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't<br>
work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it<br>
works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with<br>
little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program<br>
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.<br>

<i>&gt;     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a</i><br>
cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.<br>
When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail."<br>
I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<br>
percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my<br>
supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of<br>
her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing<br>
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received<br>
over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5<br>
bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it<br>
wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I<br>
did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race"<br>
and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any</i><br>
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked<br>
with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely<br>
is! IT WORKS!!!<br>

<i>&gt;    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is</i><br>
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of<br>
money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this<br>
out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal<br>
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the<br>
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.<br>

<i>&gt;    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my</i><br>
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that<br>
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I<br>
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I<br>
surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!<br>
For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at<br>
the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life<br>
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in<br>
the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a<br>
faster return.<br>

<i>&gt;    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered</i><br>
if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact<br>
to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another<br>
program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made<br>
more than $41,000 on the first try!!<br>

<i>&gt;     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our</i><br>
jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our<br>
money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do<br>
it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden<br>
opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!<br>
