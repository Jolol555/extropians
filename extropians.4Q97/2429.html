Oh hell,. and dadgummit too.<br>
<p>
I have to drive all the way up to Flagstaff tomorrow just to get my little <br>
Lee Enfield rifle back  It's chambered for the Winchester .308 <br>
cartridge, of which I'm sorta fond, and you really don't want to screw <br>
around with the otherwise nice day of an emotional guy like me.  <br>
<p>
(I wore out the firing pin, and it was still under warranty.  I had done <br>
the logical thing and shot it a lot.  Broke the firing pin the first day, <br>
dadgummit.)<br>
<p>
It wasn't the piss-poor third-world  ammunition that did us in.  It was <br>
the friggin' firin' pin on the Enfield itself!  My son and I just wore the <br>
sucker out with a typical morning's shooting practice.  God help the<br>
Indian Army.<br>
<p>
Well, the sportin' goods store now claims ithe rifle is fixed. They sent <br>
my rifle back to the factory.  (Sure.  Would that be the factory in Essex <br>
or the other one in Bangla Desh.  Cowards!))    I don't believe it for a <br>
minute.  But we will see.  Those damned little SKS rifles have a <br>
little 39 mm  short round, don't they?  I hear they load a lot faster than<br>
a <br>
sniper's rifle.  You just never know where the lead is gonna land.<br>
<p>
See you in the forest, maybe.<br>
