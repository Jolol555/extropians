<i>&gt; &gt;I have an incredibly simplistic view of the future: we either embrace</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;technology, or we die.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So far, that is incredibly simplistic, I must admit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The AA Prayer is my paradigm for any debate on tech:</i><br>
<i>&gt;    God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    courage to change the things I can,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    and wisdom to know the difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You've summarized the first line of the prayer, which is something,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not joking: these basics need to be said, and sorted out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please don't take my teasing style as unappreciative of the time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought you're putting into this.  More than I am at the moment--I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; just regurgitating things I've thought before.  Scoping out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation--what we can and cannot affect about tech evolution--in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cold-blooded way is exactly to the point.  It's the third line of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prayer.</i><br>
<p>
I enjoyed your response, and I particularly liked the style. However,<br>
my little tirade is hardly a reasoned argument. It was an instant<br>
hip-shot response, typed as fast as I could type. I was hoping to<br>
stimulate just the kind of message you wrote.<br>
<p>
It appears that our biggest point of disagreement is really a matter<br>
of time scales. I really don't think that ideas about ethics,<br>
government,<br>
etc. percolate as fast as technology changes. I understand your point<br>
that birthrate goes down when women can get even a small amount of<br>
education on birth control and family size economics, even in very<br>
poor countries, but the people that control the money for such<br>
educational efforts have a different agenda. You first have to change<br>
their aganda, and that takes time. My argument is not really that I<br>
think technical advance is good, but rather that IMO the the most<br>
likely consequences of technical advance are less bad than the<br>
most likely consequences of a failure to advance.<br>
