<p>
There is no such proof on that page.  What I do find is:<br>
<p>
"CH is the statement 2^aleph-null = aleph-one."<br>
<p>
"...look first at a number of different sets that have the cardinality<br>
2^aleph-null: the power set of omega,... the unit interval..."<br>
<p>
Clearly he is not proving that Pw (the power set of omega) has the<br>
cardinality of aleph-one.  He states that Pw has the same cardinality as<br>
2^aleph-null, and he says that the CH says that 2^aleph-null = aleph-one.<br>
So if he were proving what you say, he would be claiming to prove the CH,<br>
which he says is impossible.<br>
<p>
Note too that he clearly says that the cardinality of 2^aleph-null,<br>
Pw, and the unit line are the same.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry to be dragging this issue out so much, but I'm baffled that<br>
you could be reading the same book that I am and reach such different<br>
conclusions.<br>
<p>
In addition to the other URLs I gave, you might check the sci.math FAQ,<br>
which discusses CH.  One location is:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/node38.html">http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/node38.html</a><br>
<p>
This (which apparently was written by David Chalmers) leans towards the<br>
view that CH is false, that the cardinality of Pw and C is much greater<br>
than aleph-one or -two.  (Some people think you'd have to go through an<br>
infinite number of alephs before you get to it, possibly an uncountably<br>
infinite number of them!)  This FAQ also talks about the controversy<br>
over whether CH can even be said to have a truth value at all.  There are<br>
many schools of thought about this issue among mathematicians, which IMO<br>
is another aspect of mathematical research which doesn't fit that well<br>
into what I understand of Penrose's model.<br>
<p>
There is also a Continuum Hypothesis FAQ at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ii.com/math/ch/faq/">http://www.ii.com/math/ch/faq/</a><br>
<p>
This opens:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The continuum hypothesis was proposed by Georg Cantor in 1877</i><br>
<i>&gt; after he showed that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one</i><br>
<i>&gt; correspondence with the natural numbers. Cantor hypothesized that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of real numbers is the next level of infinity above the number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural numbers. He used the Hebrew letter aleph to name the different</i><br>
<i>&gt; levels of infinity: aleph_0 is the number of (or cardinality of) the</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural numbers or any countably infinite set, and the next levels of</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinity are aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, etc. Since the reals form the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quintessential continuum, Cantor named the cardinality of the reals c,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for continuum. Cantor's original formulation of the continuum hypothesis,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or CH, can be stated as either:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.card(R)=aleph_1 </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.c=aleph_1 </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; where `card(R)' means `the cardinality of the reals.' An amazing fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Cantor also proved is that the cardinality of the set of all subsets</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the natural numbers -- the power set of N or P(N) -- is equal to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cardinality of the reals.</i><br>
