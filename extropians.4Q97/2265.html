<i>&gt;THE BEST - AND WORST - WAYS TO FORECAST FUTURE ENERGY AVAILABILITY</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The best way to forecast price trends is to study past price trends, if data are </i><br>
<i>&gt;available and if there is no reason to believe that the future will be sharply different </i><br>
<i>&gt;from the past. (The reasoning that supports this point of view is set forth at length in </i><br>
<i>&gt;chapter 2.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;   For energy there are plenty of past price data available, as we have seen in figures </i><br>
<i>&gt;11-2, 11-3, and 11-4.  And there is no convincing reason to believe that the future will </i><br>
<i>&gt;break completely from the past. Therefore, extrapolation of the trends in those figures </i><br>
<i>&gt;is the most reasonable method of forecasting the future of energy supplies and costs, on </i><br>
<i>&gt;the assumption that price has been close to cost in the past and will continue to be so </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the future. This method of economic forecasting envisions progressively lower energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;costs and less scarcity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Geologists and engineers, however, rely on technical rather than price-trend data in </i><br>
<i>&gt;their forecasts of energy supplies. Because their forecasts have had so much influence on </i><br>
<i>&gt;public affairs, we must analyze their methods and meanings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   We must first dispose of the preposterous but commonly accepted notion that the energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;situation can be predicted with the aid of "known reserves".  This notion is an example </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the use of misleading numbers simply because they are the only numbers available. We </i><br>
<i>&gt;briefly considered the uselessness of this concept of "reserves" in chapter 2 with </i><br>
<i>&gt;respect to mineral resources. Now let us discuss it with respect to oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "Known reserves" means the total amount of oil in areas that have been prospected </i><br>
<i>&gt;thoroughly, quantities that geologists are quite sure of.  Individuals, firms, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;governments create known reserves by searching for promising drilling areas long in </i><br>
<i>&gt;advance of the moment when wells might be drilled - far enough ahead to allow preparation </i><br>
<i>&gt;time, but not so far ahead that the investment in prospecting costs will not obtain a </i><br>
<i>&gt;satisfactory return. The key idea here is that it costs money to produce information </i><br>
<i>&gt;about known reserves. The quantity of known reserves at any moment tells us more about </i><br>
<i>&gt;the expected profitability of oil wells than it does about the amount of oil in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ground. And the higher the cost of exploration, the lower will be the known reserves that </i><br>
<i>&gt;it pays to create. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   "Known reserves" are much like the food we put into our cupboards at home.  We stock </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough groceries for a few weeks or days - not so much that we will be carrying a heavy </i><br>
<i>&gt;unneeded inventory that bulges the cupboard and ties up an unnecessary amount of money in </i><br>
<i>&gt;groceries, and not so little that we may run out if an unexpected event - a guest or a </i><br>
<i>&gt;blizzard - should descend upon us. The amount of food in our cupboards tells little or </i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing about the scarcity of food in our communities, because as a rule it does not </i><br>
<i>&gt;reveal how much food is available in the retail stores. Similarly, the oil in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;"cupboard" - the quantity of known reserves - tells us nothing about the quantities of </i><br>
<i>&gt;oil that can be obtained in the long run at various extraction costs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   This explains why the quantity of known reserves, as if by a miracle of coincidence, </i><br>
<i>&gt;stays just a step ahead of demand, as seen in figure 11-5. An elderly man commented to me </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the 1970s that, according to the news stories about known reserves, "we've been just </i><br>
<i>&gt;about to run out of oil ever since I've been a boy." Yet most discussions of the oil and </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy situation - among laymen and also among the most respected journalists - still </i><br>
<i>&gt;focus on known reserves. Figure 11-6, taken from Newsweek, is typical. The graph </i><br>
<i>&gt;apparently shows that the world's proven reserves have been declining, leading to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;rhetorical threat above the picture "End of the oil? ... How much is left to find?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;                       Figures 11-5 and 11-6</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Even more misleading is a graph of proven reserves in the U.S. alone, as in figure 11-</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. As the U.S. turns to imports because they are cheaper than the home product, its </i><br>
<i>&gt;proven reserves inevitably will fall. If one were to draw a graph of U.S. proven reserves </i><br>
<i>&gt;of aluminum or gold, they also would appear tiny. So what?</i><br>
<i>&gt;                           Figure 11-7</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A more "sophisticated" - and even more misleading - approach is to project present </i><br>
<i>&gt;growth in demand, assuming the price will remain constant, and then compare that </i><br>
<i>&gt;projection to known reserves, thereby indicating that demand will apparently outstrip </i><br>
<i>&gt;supply very soon.  This approach may be seen in figure 11-8. Even assuming that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;growth in demand at present prices is reasonably estimated - and this would be difficult </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do well - all that such a calculation would show is that price must rise in order to </i><br>
<i>&gt;lower the demand and raise the supply until demand and supply meet. This basic economic </i><br>
<i>&gt;way of looking at supply and demand is totally missing from figure 11-8.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                           Figure 11-8</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Equally misleading is the assumption underlying figure 11-8 that there will be no </i><br>
<i>&gt;developments in oil production or in other energy sources that will make future energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;costs lower than they would be with the present state of technological knowledge. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;BETTER TECHNICAL FORECASTING METHODS</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If one insists on making a technical forecast of the energy supply - even though such </i><br>
<i>&gt;a forecast is likely to be inferior to extrapolations of past economic trends - how </i><br>
<i>&gt;should it best be done?  That is, how might one make a sound material-technical forecast </i><br>
<i>&gt;for oil and energy in the near term - say over the next ten or twenty years?  (See </i><br>
<i>&gt;chapter 2 for a general discussion of material-technical forecasts of resource supply.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;   During the next decade or two, increases in income and population in the U.S. and in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the world may be assumed to be known.  Therefore, they can be taken into account as data </i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than treated as imponderables. In addition, forecasts of the production of energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the near-term future utilize two other kinds of information: (1) engineering estimates </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the cost of extracting fuel from such currently unexploited sources as shale oil and </i><br>
<i>&gt;windpower with available technology, based on calculations of the engineering inputs </i><br>
<i>&gt;required for each type of energy source, and (2) economic estimates of how many </i><br>
<i>&gt;conventional new oil wells and coal mines and nuclear reactors will be developed at </i><br>
<i>&gt;various prices higher and lower than the present energy prices, based on past data about </i><br>
<i>&gt;the extent to which energy-producing firms respond to changes in market prices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Engineering estimates must play the dominant role in forecasts of the place of nuclear </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy, shale oil, solar power, windpower, and other energy sources for which there are </i><br>
<i>&gt;considerable uncertainties about technical processes and costs due to a lack of </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience with these sources. But where an energy source is currently being employed </i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently to produce a large body of data about the process of extraction and about </i><br>
<i>&gt;producer behavior, as is true of the fossil fuels, empirical economic estimates of supply </i><br>
<i>&gt;response to price changes should have the dominant role. The best overall energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;forecast, therefore, would be a blend of both the economic and engineering approaches.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   There is great variety, however, in the estimates of engineers and scientists about </i><br>
<i>&gt;the future costs of developing such energy sources as shale oil and nuclear power. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Technologists also differ greatly in their guesses about the dangers to life from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;various processes.  And economists differ considerably in their estimates of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;responsiveness of the energy industry to various price levels.  For example, in 1977 the </i><br>
<i>&gt;supply of natural gas became a very contentious political issue.  These were some of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;resulting supply estimates: 1)  The predecessor agency of the Department of Energy  made </i><br>
<i>&gt;three production estimates within three months, varying by a factor of three! President </i><br>
<i>&gt;Jimmy Carter offered an even lower estimate than the lowest of those three, that there </i><br>
<i>&gt;was only "10 years supply ... at 1974 technology and 1974 prices". (2) The American Gas </i><br>
<i>&gt;Association said that there is enough gas "to last between 1,000 and 2,500 years at </i><br>
<i>&gt;current consumption."  And the newspaper story continued that "Experts in ERDA [Energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;Research and Development Administration] have been trying to tell the White House [this] </i><br>
<i>&gt;too". The difference between this and the estimate in (1) above boggles the mind - 10 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years' supply versus a 1,000-2,500 years' supply!  (3) A later "official" estimate, made </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the midst of the congressional debate on energy in the same year 1977, by Dr. Vincent </i><br>
<i>&gt;E. McKelvey, who was then director of the U.S. Geological Survey, was that "as much as </i><br>
<i>&gt;... 3,000 to 4,000 times the amount of natural gas the United States will consume this </i><br>
<i>&gt;year may be sealed in the geo-pressured zones underlying the Gulf Coast region". But this </i><br>
<i>&gt;estimate ran contrary to what the Carter White House was saying, and within two months </i><br>
<i>&gt;McKelvey was fired from his job as director - after six years as director and thirty-</i><br>
<i>&gt;seven years at the Geological Survey, and after being nominated for the director's job by </i><br>
<i>&gt;the National Academy of Sciences. As the Wall Street Journal put it, "Dr. McKelvey did </i><br>
<i>&gt;not know enough to keep his mouth shut!"  Such enormous variation can arise simply as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;result of political fiddling with the figures. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   A more recent sober estimate by the "International Gas Union Committee on World Gas </i><br>
<i>&gt;Supply and Demand estimates that even by the year 2000, the static lifetime of world gas </i><br>
<i>&gt;reserves will be 112 years."  - and that does not include future discoveries of gas, of </i><br>
<i>&gt;course. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   With respect to still-undeveloped sources such as shale oil and artificial gas, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;variation in estimates is greater yet. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Why do estimates of supply response to price changes differ so widely?  There are a </i><br>
<i>&gt;host of reasons, including (a) vested interests - for example, the oil companies have a </i><br>
<i>&gt;stake in lowgas prices paid to gas suppliers so that fewer gas wells will be drilled and </i><br>
<i>&gt;more oil will be sold, and hence they want lower estimates of the responsiveness of </i><br>
<i>&gt;natural gas supplies to changes in price; in contrast, gas companies have a stake in </i><br>
<i>&gt;higher (unregulated) prices, and hence want higher estimates of gas supply </i><br>
<i>&gt;responsiveness; (b) basic beliefs about the "finiteness" of potential supplies and about </i><br>
<i>&gt;the likelihood of the human imagination to respond to needs with new developments; (c) </i><br>
<i>&gt;differences in the scientific imaginations of the engineers and geologists making the </i><br>
<i>&gt;estimates; and (d) professional differences among engineers and among economists due to </i><br>
<i>&gt;differences in technical approaches.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Every month, it seems, we read of new ways to get more energy.  Item:  Three-</i><br>
<i>&gt;dimensional seismic exploration methods have produced large new oil discoveries at very </i><br>
<i>&gt;low cost.  In Nigeria and Oman, Shell "has found new oil reserves at costs of less than </i><br>
<i>&gt;10 cents a barrel."   Item: Lumps of methane hydrate on the ocean floor could constitute </i><br>
<i>&gt;"a potential fuel reserve that may dwarf all the fossil fuel deposits on land combined."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                               ***</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   In my view, the data and theory continue to support a forecast made years ago by </i><br>
<i>&gt;Herman Kahn and associates. "Energy costs as a whole are very likely to continue the </i><br>
<i>&gt;historical downward trend indefinitely...Except for temporary fluctuations caused by bad </i><br>
<i>&gt;luck or poor management, the world need not worry about energy shortages or costs in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;future".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  WHAT ABOUT THE VERY LONG RUN?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Chapter 3 alluded to the increase in efficiency in energy use over the decades and </i><br>
<i>&gt;centuries.  An analysis by William Baumol mentioned there shows that such increases in </i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiency have huge effects.   The key idea is that an improvement in productivity not </i><br>
<i>&gt;only reduces resource use in the present but, even more important, also increases the </i><br>
<i>&gt;future services of the entire stock of unused resources.  This alone could mean that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;future supply will never run out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   This process may be seen in figure 11-9, where the amount of coal required to move a </i><br>
<i>&gt;ton of freight by sea fell to about a tenth of its 1830 value by 1890.  That is a greater </i><br>
<i>&gt;proportion of increase in efficiency than was the increase in population over those </i><br>
<i>&gt;years.  The transition to oil represented an increase in economic efficiency (or it would </i><br>
<i>&gt;not have taken place).  And there is no reason why that process should not continue </i><br>
<i>&gt;indefinitely, with ship surfaces getting smoother, and so on.  Of course nuclear power </i><br>
<i>&gt;can replace coal and oil entirely, which constitutes an increase in efficiency so great </i><br>
<i>&gt;that it is beyond my powers to portray the entire process on a single graph based on </i><br>
<i>&gt;physical units.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                Fig 11-9 from Lebergott, p. 419</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Much the same occurs with electricity in figure 11-9.  A generator converts the heat </i><br>
<i>&gt;from fuels or the power of falling water into electrical energy.  One cannot extract more </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy from a generator than one puts in, but in addition to increasing efficiency in </i><br>
<i>&gt;generation, there is increasing efficiency in end-use products such as refrigeration, </i><br>
<i>&gt;heaters, and appliances. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The process is even more extraordinary with respect to the input of human energy (no </i><br>
<i>&gt;matter how human energy is measured).  A handful of humans can now move hundreds of </i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands of tons of freight across an ocean in a single ship, many fewer people per ton </i><br>
<i>&gt;than in centuries past.  And measured in ton-miles per day, the increase in efficiency is </i><br>
<i>&gt;even greater. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    THE NON-FINITENESS OF OIL                   </i><br>
<i>&gt;   You may wonder whether "non-renewable" energy resources such as oil, coal, and natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;gas differ from the recyclable minerals in such a fashion that the non-finite arguments </i><br>
<i>&gt;in earlier chapters do not apply.  Eventually we'll burn all the coal and oil that </i><br>
<i>&gt;powered these impressive advances, you may be thinking.  But our energy supply also is </i><br>
<i>&gt;non-finite, including oil as an important example. That was not a misprint. In chapter 3 </i><br>
<i>&gt;I showed that it is necessary to say how one would count the amount of a resource if one </i><br>
<i>&gt;is to meaningfully say that the resource is finite.  Therefore, let's consider the </i><br>
<i>&gt;following sequence of difficulties with respect to counting the amount of oil.  As with </i><br>
<i>&gt;other resources, careful thinking leads to the conclusion that the potential amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt;oil - and even more, the amount of the services that we now get from oil - is not finite.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (1) The oil potential of a particular well may be measured, and hence it is limited </i><br>
<i>&gt;(though it is interesting and relevant that as we develop new ways of extracting hard-to-</i><br>
<i>&gt;get oil, the economic capacity of a well increases). But the number of wells that will </i><br>
<i>&gt;eventually produce oil, and in what quantities, is not known or measurable at present and </i><br>
<i>&gt;probably never will be, and hence is not meaningfully finite. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (2) Even if we unrealistically assume that the number of potential wells in the earth </i><br>
<i>&gt;might be surveyed completely and that we could arrive at a reasonable estimate of the oil </i><br>
<i>&gt;that might be obtained with present technology (or even with technology that will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;developed in the next 100 years), we still would have to reckon the future possibilities </i><br>
<i>&gt;of shale oil and tar sands - a difficult task. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (3) But let us assume that we could reckon the oil potential of shale and tar sands. </i><br>
<i>&gt;We would then have to reckon the conversion of coal to oil. That, too, might be done, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;the measurement is becoming increasingly loose, and hence less "finite" and "limited." </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (4) Then there is the oil that we might produce, not from fossils, but from new crops </i><br>
<i>&gt;- palm oil, soybean oil, and so on. Clearly, there is no meaningful limit to this source </i><br>
<i>&gt;except the sun's energy (land and water are not limits - see chapters 6 and 10).  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;notion of finiteness is making ever less sense as we proceed. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (5) If we allow for the substitution of nuclear and solar power for oil - and this </i><br>
<i>&gt;makes sense because what we really want are the services of oil and not oil itself - the </i><br>
<i>&gt;notion of a limit is even less meaningful. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   (6) Of course the sun may eventually run down. But even if our sun were not as vast as </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is, there may well be other suns elsewhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The joke at the head of chapter 3 makes the point that whether there is an "ultimate" </i><br>
<i>&gt;end to all this - that is, whether the energy supply really is "finite" after the sun and </i><br>
<i>&gt;all the other planets have been exhausted - is a question so hypothetical that it should </i><br>
<i>&gt;be compared with other metaphysical entertainments such as calculating the number of </i><br>
<i>&gt;angels that can dance on the head of a pin. As long as we continue to draw energy from </i><br>
<i>&gt;the sun, any conclusion about whether energy is "ultimately finite" or not has no bearing </i><br>
<i>&gt;upon present policy decisions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   About energy from the sun: The assertion that our resources are ultimately finite </i><br>
<i>&gt;seems most relevant to energy but yet is actually more misleading with respect to energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;than with respect to other resources. When people say that mineral resources are "finite" </i><br>
<i>&gt;they are invariably referring to the earth as a bounded system - the "spaceship earth" to </i><br>
<i>&gt;which we are apparently confined just as astronauts are confined to their spaceship. But </i><br>
<i>&gt;the main source of our energy even now is the sun, no matter how you think of the matter. </i><br>
<i>&gt;This goes far beyond the fact that the sun was the prior source of the energy locked into </i><br>
<i>&gt;the oil and coal we use. The sun is also the source of the energy in the food we eat, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the trees that we use for many purposes. In coming years, solar energy may be used to </i><br>
<i>&gt;heat homes and water in many parts of the world. (As of 1965, much of Israel's hot water </i><br>
<i>&gt;had been heated by solar devices for years, even when the price of oil was much lower </i><br>
<i>&gt;than it is now, although I remember that the showers you got with this water were at best </i><br>
<i>&gt;lukewarm unless you used a backup electrical system to boost the temperature.) If the </i><br>
<i>&gt;prices of conventional energy supplies were to rise considerably higher than they now </i><br>
<i>&gt;are, solar energy could be called on for much more of our needs, though this price rise </i><br>
<i>&gt;seems unlikely given present technology. And even if the earth were sometime to run out </i><br>
<i>&gt;of sources of energy for nuclear processes - a prospect so distant that it is a waste of </i><br>
<i>&gt;time to talk about it - there are energy sources on other planets. Hence the notion that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the supply of energy is finite because the earth's fossil fuels or even its nuclear fuels </i><br>
<i>&gt;are limited is sheer nonsense. And this discussion has omitted consideration of any </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy sources still to be discovered. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                           CONCLUSIONS</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Energy differs from other resources because it is "used up," and cannot be recycled.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Energy apparently trends toward exhaustion.  It seems impossible to keep using energy and </i><br>
<i>&gt;still never begin to run out - that is, never reach a point of increasing scarcity.  But </i><br>
<i>&gt;the long-run trends in energy prices, together with the explanatory theory of induced </i><br>
<i>&gt;innovation, promise continually decreasing scarcity and cost - just the opposite of </i><br>
<i>&gt;popular opinion. At worst, the cost ceiling provided by nuclear power guarantees that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;cost of electrical power cannot rise far above present energy costs, political obstacles </i><br>
<i>&gt;aside.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The historical facts entirely contradict the commonsensical Malthusian theory that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;more we use, the less there is left to use and hence the greater the scarcity.  Through </i><br>
<i>&gt;the centuries, the prices of energy -- coal, oil, and electricity --  have been </i><br>
<i>&gt;decreasing rather than increasing, relative to the cost of labor and even relative to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;price of consumer goods, just as with all other natural resources.  And nuclear energy, </i><br>
<i>&gt;which at present costs much the same as coal and oil,  guarantees an inexhaustible supply </i><br>
<i>&gt;of energy at declining cost as technology improves.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   In economic terms, this means that energy has been getting more available, rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt;more scarce, as far back as we have data.  This implies that the rate at which our stocks </i><br>
<i>&gt;of resources increase, or the increasing efficiency of use over time, or a combination of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the two forces, have overmatched the exhaustion of resources. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Another way to look at the matter:  energy has become less and less important as </i><br>
<i>&gt;measured by its share of GNP.  This is the same story as revealed by all other natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;resources. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The reason that the prices of energy and other natural resources decline even as we </i><br>
<i>&gt;use more is the advance of technology.  Nevertheless, just as with land and copper, there </i><br>
<i>&gt;are other forces at play which make it possible for us to have increasing amounts of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;services we need even as we boost the demands we make upon the supplies of those </i><br>
<i>&gt;resources. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   One saving grace is improved techniques of use.  Consider the steam engine, which when </i><br>
<i>&gt;first invented operated at 1 percent efficiency.  Engines nowadays operate perhaps thirty </i><br>
<i>&gt;times more efficiently.  That is, they use a thirtieth as much energy for the same </i><br>
<i>&gt;result.  The invention of the microwave oven immediately meant that only 10 percent as </i><br>
<i>&gt;much energy was necessary to cook a meal as before.  When someone finds a way to increase </i><br>
<i>&gt;the efficiency of using a resource, the discovery not only increases the efficiency of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the energy we use this year, but it also increases the effective stocks resources that </i><br>
<i>&gt;are known or are as yet undiscovered.  And this process could continue a long time, </i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps indefinitely. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Also important are increases in energy supply.  We learn how to dig deeper, pump </i><br>
<i>&gt;faster.  And we invent new sources of energy -- aside from coal, shale, oil, tar sands, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and the like.  We can also "grow" oil substitutes as long as there is sunlight to raise </i><br>
<i>&gt;plants.  (See chapter 6 on hydroponic farming using fresh water.  And production of oil-</i><br>
<i>&gt;seed crops that grow with salt water, which allows agriculture with irrigation of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;desert, is now entering commercial development in Saudi Arabia.  Also, nuclear fission </i><br>
<i>&gt;power will be available at constant or declining costs practically forever. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   After our sun runs out of energy, there may be nuclear fusion, or some other suns to </i><br>
<i>&gt;take care of our needs.  We've got seven billion years to discover solutions to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;theoretical problems that we have only been able to cook up in the past few centuries of </i><br>
<i>&gt;progress in physics.  It's reasonable to expect the supply of energy to continue becoming </i><br>
<i>&gt;more available, forever.  </i><br>

<i>&gt;the fourth paragraph.</i><br>
