<i>&gt; Eliezer: Hmmm, Godel, Escher, Bach *is* a superb book. I worked through</i><br>
<i>&gt; that back when I was 18. However, as an overview of AI and cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; science, I think that Hofstadter and Dennett's The Mind's I might be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; accessible. (Or maybe I'll just include both, though this is supposed to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a select rather than comprehensive list.) Comments?</i><br>
<p>
GEB is a hard book to classify. It is cognitive science and AI, but<br>
also philosophy, art and entertainment. In the Aleph handbook we classified<br>
it as Multidsciplinary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For those who suggested more Egan books, I'll be happy to include more by</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of my favorite SF writers. I'm not so keen on Permutation City, though</i><br>
<i>&gt; may include it. I will definitely include his brilliant collection Axiomatic.</i><br>
<p>
Permutation City isn't a good novel in the reading sense, but it is *the*<br>
book about uploading. As for extropian ideas, Distress is better and<br>
(of course) Axiomatic. Maybe Axiomatic should be in the canon and the<br>
other in the apocrypha. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anders: Tech Heaven may be a good cryonics story. Has anyone read Blake's</i><br>
<i>&gt; book (i.e. Gregory Benford) whose title I cannot remember. I'd like to</i><br>
<i>&gt; include *one* cryonics-related novel. I haven't read The Bohr Maker but</i><br>
<i>&gt; will try to. I didn't much like Deception Well and don't see why it fits</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly well into this reading list. Out of Control is a good addition.</i><br>
<p>
Well, you are probably right about DW. The Bohr Maker is so extropian<br>
it screams - the villains are ecofascists and biofundamentalists, the<br>
heros nano- and gene hackers from an interplanetary corporation-society. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Has anyone read Robert Forward's Indistinguisable from Magic? (I believe it</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to be known as Future Magic.) I think it may be a good overview of how</i><br>
<i>&gt; far science and technology can be pushed. Perhaps I'll get to read it on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the plane this week.</i><br>
<p>
Forward's writing has never impressed me, it suffers from the info-dump<br>
syndrome ("As you already know, the hyperdrive works by sending pellets<br>
of negative matter into a strong toroidal electric field..."), but<br>
the non-fiction is an accessible introduction to megascale engineering<br>
and other stuff. <br>
<p>
Another book that should be canon if it isn't already is Bernal's<br>
_The World, the Flesh, the Devil_. It may need some annotations (it is<br>
after all many decades old and written by a leftist), but it has <br>
influenced transhumanist thinking very much. <br>
