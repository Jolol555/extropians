It may not be Official Science, but reading Dr Miller was personally<br>
very edifying as my family was very dysfunctional in many of the ways<br>
she describes, and please consider reading it ("For Your Own Good") at<br>
least for entertainment's sake. BTW, it has the only explanation I have<br>
ever seen which makes any kind of sense concerning the Nazis.<br>

Definitely talk to the Shaman first. Freudians are full of it. And if<br>
you need a Shaman, I happen to be one. A Shaman whose basic POV is<br>
Scientific Materialism.<br>
