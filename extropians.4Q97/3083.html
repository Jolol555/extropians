Criticize me if I'm missing a key element here, but the 'solution' seems<br>
inherent in the problem.  They're immortal.  They don't need to study<br>
history so much, because they're the ones who lived it.  I think this<br>
continuity of memory, presumably with high fidelity of public and one's<br>
own private recrods, could well offset the loss of other people's<br>
private information.  I think private decision information is much less<br>
important than people not knowing public information.<br>

I tried to wash its scaly head, but all it did was cry,<br>
