Subject: NY Times Lies Re: Goddard<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The New York Times editorial "Conspiracies, Real=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Imagined"  (11/14/97)  falsely states that:=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Mr. Goddard now says he INVENTED the tale [the=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Navy-Missile theory] to give the Government a=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;'black eye.'"  (emphasis added)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was contacted by Matthew Wald with the New York=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Times the day the CNN story hit, over a week before=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;that NY Times editorial. I explained to Mr. Wald=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I never admitted to perpetrating a sham or a=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;hoax, that I have only presented eyewitness accounts=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;and press reports pertaining to military activity=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;on July 17, 1996. I "invented" NOTHING. I was even=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;a relative late comer to the USN-TWA theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I also sent him all the messages I have sent here.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;But nevertheless, the New York Times ignores what=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;I actually say and instead they say that I said I=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;invented the whole thing. Clearly, they chose to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;publish the false over the true. Why???!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a naked farce, a deliberate attempt to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;destroy the truth, the Navy-missile theory, and=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;me to boot. Why would they do this? Other reports=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim I wrote the so-called "anonymous Internet=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;document," which was written by former 747 pilot=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Richard Russell. The unrelenting year-long sweep=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;of disinformation throughout the media points to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;only one logical answer to that question: there=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a massive media-wide cover-up underway.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have spoken with reporters who tell me they can-</i><br>
<i>&gt;not cover witnesses accounts. When I ask why, no=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer is given. All the major network programs,=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;even fringe programs like HARD COPY, refuse to show=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;the radar tapes, except a 2 second flash by Prime=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Time Live that prevented any meaningful perception=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their content. Richard Russell, who had extra=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;copies he forgot to give the FBI when they took=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;the masters, has tried and tried to get media to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;show the tape, with no luck. It's authenticity is=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;not in question. The FBI has conceded authenticity.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a fact that Russell has inside contacts. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;FBI has been interrogating his friends in an=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;effort to track down that contact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The evidence is clear that there is a clamp down=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;on all evidence pointing to Navy culpability and=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is an agenda to destroy those pushing the=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;case, particularly yours truly. It's all right=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;there for anyone to see. It seems clear that it's=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;a national security issue, and that under such,=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's Marshall Law regarding the issue of TWA 800.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pointing in this direction is the fact that on=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;the very same day (03/11/97) the FBI learned that=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Russell had the radar tapes, showing a possible=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Navy missile, and went to get the tapes, President=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clinton signed Executive Order 13039, which excludes=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Naval Special Warfare Development Group from=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;federal whistle-blower protections for reasons of=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;"national security." The SpecWarDevGru is involved=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the littoral (coastal) Cruise Missile Defense=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;program which seems to be what was happening off=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Long Island during the "Global Yankee '96" military=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;exercises taking place off L.I. on July 17, 1996.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;E.O. 13039 went into effect one day before the Paris=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Match article came out showing photos of the radar=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;tapes. I believe they fear any favorable media=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;coverage such as the Match article, because this=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;creates an atmosphere that could encourage "loose=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;lips." It could make the suppressed feel it was safe=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;to come out, that someone will listen. It seems that=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;the master planners panicked when they realized the=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;radar data was out and rushed to exempt the key Navy=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;R&amp;D group from whistle-blower protections.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Allowing a fair degree of obvious media oppression=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be determined as necessary to signal those that</i><br>
<i>&gt;might speak up, that your dead meat if you do...</i><br>
<i>&gt;look how we cooked Goddard's ass. If a Navy person</i><br>
<i>&gt;came forward, they'd say he was perpetrating a hoax</i><br>
<i>&gt;for money, for fame, to get back at his superiors...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is one of the most massive cover-ups in history.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyone who takes the time to read a few of my short=20</i><br>
