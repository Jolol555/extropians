Yes, that's their claim, by breathing the air on any land mass on the Earth's <br>
surface you have in effect signed away your rights and  "voluntarily" given <br>
some government the power of life and death over you. It matters not at all <br>
if you or I think this reasoning makes the slightest sense or not because<br>
they have the power to enforce it regardless.  <br>

                       <br>
Why? Nobody on this list is foolish enough to be talking about a world where  <br>
everybody can do anything they want to, if you want to bash in my head with a <br>
baseball bat and I'd rather you didn't then we can't both have our way. <br>
What many of us are talking about is a world without government and the <br>
reasons this would encourage libertarianism. All police would be private <br>
police who work for various private protection agencies, and people don't<br>
like to PAY to restrain the private behavior of others in most areas, child <br>
abuse and perhaps a few others excepted. If you try to enforce your private <br>
law that most people hate and find intrusive then it's going to be very <br>
expensive for you, however if everybody except me thinks it's important to <br>
ware a funny hat every Tuesday and are willing to pay big bucks to enforce it <br>
then I'm just going to have to ware a funny hat on Tuesday. Everybody  can't <br>
have total control over what laws they want to live by, but we can have a lot <br>
more control than we have now.<br>
                        <br>

<i>        &gt;2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Of course, this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
This is how I think government will die, unless the singularity happens first <br>
and changes the world so radically that it renders these matters moot. <br>
Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide <br>
communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will <br>
make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes. My confidence comes from the <br>
power of exponential growth. In general, if I increase the complexity of my <br>
encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice  as long to encrypt it, I have <br>
made it not twice, but billions of times more difficult for an attacker to <br>
break it. The government has access to more  powerful computers than I do,<br>
but not that much more powerful. There is just  no getting around it, recent <br>
developments in mathematics and communication have tipped the balance away <br>
from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  For the first time in <br>
human history 2 people on opposite sides of the world will soon be able to <br>
make enforceable contracts without anybody else knowing about it, and even <br>
they might not know or need to know the physical location of the other.<br>
<p>
Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves <br>
in this brave new world, but making rules is easy,  enforcing them is not. <br>
Short of dismantling the internet and confiscating all home computers it's <br>
impossible to dictate what form of  encryption or digital cash you must use <br>
in your home. When people are given a choice between one form of cash that <br>
government likes and you pay tax on and another that you don't it won't take <br>
them long to make a decision.<br>
<p>
Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't find the <br>
money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would not work as <br>
people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of course) that <br>
suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be extracted, like<br>
property taxes and building permits, would have to be increased to astronomic <br>
levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a tax revolt would follow. <br>
Without money government will grind to a halt. <br>
                        <br>

<i>        &gt;America is theoretically a democracy</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Actually it's a republic, but I'm picking nits,  and I can't quite decide <br>
which of the two is more repulsive.                 <br>
