"Monkeys are given head transplants <br>
<p>
<p>
by Lois Rogers <br>
Medical Correspondent <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
SURGEONS have transplanted monkeys' heads on to fresh bodies,<br>
paving the way for a new era in human transplant technology. <br>
By maintaining the brain stem,  which deals with reflexes such as <br>
breathing, heart function and digestion, the research team has been<br>
able to keep the new brain supplied with fresh, oxygenated blood. <br>
<p>
A series of experiments involving up to 30 animals has allowed<br>
surgeons to perfect a technique of minimising loss of blood supply<br>
to the heads during severance operations. <br>
<p>
The researchers also believe there was little disturbance to the <br>
monkeys' higher brain functions as a result of the procedure. <br>
<p>
The animals were able to maintain the cycle of waking and sleeping. <br>
They were capable of visually tracking laboratory staff and could<br>
react to voices and noises. <br>
<p>
Their facial nerves were still operational and they could eat and<br>
drink normally. When a member of the team put a finger into an<br>
experimental animal's mouth when it seemed irritable, he was<br>
bitten. "....<br>
<p>
"The latest developments in the 20-year project, including the<br>
vital step of achieving respiration in the transplanted heads, have<br>
been reported in an American scientific journal by Robert White,<br>
professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University in<br>
Cleveland, Ohio. <br>
<p>
White believes the technology will benefit people facing<br>
multi-organ transplants because of serious injury to their bodies;<br>
sufferers of degenerative diseases, and ultimately those who want<br>
a new lease on life by transferring an old head onto a younger<br>
body.".... <br>
<p>
<p>
"I have devised the operation that would need to be done in<br>
humans," said White. "I have been to autopsy rooms and dissecting<br>
rooms and examined the sort of incisions which would have to be<br>
made, and at what level, and how the various vessels would need to<br>
be reconnected. <br>
<p>
"We are talking about an operation that could be done on humans.<br>
Whether it should be done is another question." <br>
<p>
So far the bodies pumping blood through the transplanted brains<br>
have  remained completely paralysed because researchers have been<br>
unable to reconnect the nerve fibres from the spinal cord in the<br>
body to the brain. <br>
<p>
The brains can think and are conscious, but cannot communicate with<br>
the limbs. "I have no doubt this treatment will be available in the<br>
public arena within the next 25 to 30 years," White said. "There<br>
will be a lot of ethical and moral arguments, but I think they are<br>
inappropriate.  What we are trying to do here is to prolong life.<br>
The human spirit or soul is within the physical structure of the<br>
brain. I don't think it's in your left arm or anywhere else." <br>
<p>
However, he admitted the definition of brain death would have to be<br>
altered to allow bodies, possibly those in a persistent vegetative <br>
state in which there was still some brain stem activity, to be used<br>
as donors." ....<br>
<p>
"Peter Hamlyn, a leading neurosurgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital<br>
in London, who helped set up the British Brain and Spine<br>
Foundation, said the work was cruel and irrelevant. "...<br>
[comment: and penning animals for life in order to slaughter them<br>
is not, I suppose?]...<br>
<p>
"Your head might as well be in a jar as attached to another body.<br>
The fact that it is tied to a body acting simply as a pump would<br>
just be an inconvenience because you would have to drag the body<br>
around. [comment: he completely ignores the fact that successfully<br>
reattaching the spinal column may well be only a matter of time and<br>
technique]<br>
<p>
"There might be a few cranks who would want it done, but for normal<br>
people the whole point of having a brain is that it interacts with<br>
the body," he said. <br>
<p>
Other ethicists and theologians are worried that the technology<br>
could be exploited for cosmetic life extension. [ comment:<br>
"cosmetic life extension"? Sounds like an oxymoron to me]<br>
<p>
"It is indicative of the disastrous route that Western medicine is <br>
taking," said Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical <br>
Ethics. "Is any individual so important to society that we should <br>
tolerate attempts to lengthen their existence in a way which most<br>
people would find abhorrent?" <br>
<p>
David Jenkins, the former Bishop of Durham, said he was concerned<br>
by the social trend represented by head transplant research. "I do<br>
get more and more alarmed that people refuse to see limits. To try<br>
to put a head on a different body would be totally destructive of<br>
the personality. I would sooner be totally dead than half and<br>
half."<br>
