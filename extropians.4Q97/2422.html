I am going to cordially withdraw from this debate, because I can't<br>
answer that question because I don't know.  The problem is this:<br>
things like politics, social practice, and economics, are far<br>
too complicated to analyze in detail with the current state of<br>
human knowledge.  Every few years, I get into a conversation like<br>
this and get convinced about one thing or another.  Later, some<br>
party pooper like you :-) comes along and shakes my faith in my<br>
previous conclusion.  This *always* happens to me in these types<br>
of conversations, no matter how many times I have them.  The only<br>
conclusion I can draw is that either I'm just not smart enough to<br>
figure these things out, or that *nobody* is smart enough to see<br>
all the sides to figure these things out conclusively.<br>
<p>
I like to pretend I'm a scientist on most days.  That means I like<br>
to see facts and figures before I make a decision.  The problem, as<br>
we've demonstrated above, is that there isn't even agreement on what<br>
constitutes a salient fact, or what things we should count when we're<br>
building numbers to argue with.  I quote numbers, then you contest them.<br>
I can go and try to quote more numbers and facts, but we'll probably<br>
disagree on what facts are relevant and what constitutes a valid cost<br>
when pricing a barrel of oil.  I really should learn to stay out of<br>
these conversations.  At least I'm getting better at withdrawing sooner.<br>
<p>
Understanding Quantum Teleportation is far, far easier in comparison.<br>
I think I'll stick to that thread, and go back to being a lurker on<br>
this one.<br>
