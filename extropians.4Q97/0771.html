Suppose an advanced civilization wants to capture and store as much of the<br>
Sun's energy output as possible (as say antimatter), without disturbing<br>
its stellar processes, how would they do it? Most likely by building a<br>
sphere around the Sun and taking advantage of the temperature difference<br>
between sunlight and its external radiators to operate a giant heat<br>
engine. The efficiency of this heat engine determines the percentage of<br>
the solar energy output that can be captured and the temperature of the<br>
shell itself. I will assume that the heat engine is as efficient as<br>
possible given only thermodynamic constraints.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg gives a calculation of the thermodynamic efficiency of the<br>
dyson shell in his (draft) Jupiter Brain paper, and concludes that a<br>
smaller dyson shell is more efficient than a larger one. But I think his<br>
reasoning is slightly flawed. I'll show that the reverse is true, and that<br>
dyson shells may have a much lower temperature than previously thought<br>
(see for example<br>
<a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dysonFAQ.html#LOOK">http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dysonFAQ.html#LOOK</a>) which may<br>
explain why they have not yet been observed. Previous temperature<br>
estimates assume that the energy captured by dyson shells is also used up<br>
(dissippated) by them. However it seems more reasonable to assume that<br>
dyson shells only serve as energy collectors, and that the energy stored<br>
by them is eventually used elsewhere. For example really large computers<br>
may be set in interstellar space for more efficient cooling, physical<br>
security, and access to multiple energy sources.<br>
<p>
A heat engine works between two heat reservoirs with a temperature<br>
difference. A dyson shell works between the Sun which has a surface<br>
temperature of 5800 K and the temperature of its external radiators which<br>
is initially at 3 K, the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. <br>
However, even with a temperature difference as large as this it cannot be<br>
100% efficient and therefore must radiate away waste heat. However its<br>
ability to radiate waste heat is limited by its external surface area and<br>
soon its radiators grow hotter as the waste heat builds up. This has two<br>
effects. First it allows the radiators to eliminate heat more quickly, and<br>
second it makes the dyson shell less efficient because the temperature<br>
difference is smaller, thereby causing it to producing more waste heat. <br>
Fortunately the first effect dominates so the external temperature<br>
eventually reaches an equilibrium. The temperature at this equilibrium can<br>
be found by applying Carnot's Theorem and Stefan-Boltzmann's Law. <br>
<p>
Carnot's theorem says an ideal heat engine working between temperatures of<br>
Th and Tl has an efficiency of (Th-Tl)/Th. Here Th is the temperature of<br>
the Sun, and Tl is the temperature of the dyson sphere's external<br>
radiators. It follows that the dyson sphere must radiate away Tl/Th of the<br>
Sun's energy output (S) as waste heat. The amount of waste heat that can<br>
be radiated away by a blackbody sphere of radius r and temperature Tl is<br>
derived from Stefan-Boltzmann's Law as 4*pi*r^2*sigma*(Tl^4-Tb^4) where Tb<br>
is cosmic background temperature and sigma is Stefan-Boltzman's constant.<br>
So to find the equilibrium temperature we set that equal to S*Tl/Th and<br>
solve for Tl.<br>
<p>
Doing this in Mathematica produces a complex looking solution to the<br>
quartic equation, which I will not bother to reproduce here. However it<br>
turns out that the effect of the cosmic background radiation is not<br>
noticeable until we get to a radius of about 100 AUs. Ignoring the cosmic<br>
background radiation gives us Tl~=(S/(4*pi*r^2*sigma*Th))^(1/3). At 1 AU<br>
this is 161 K with efficiency of 97%, and at 10 AUs this is 35 K with<br>
efficiency of 99.4%. At 100 AUs, and taking into account cosmic background<br>
radiation, Tl is 7.6 K with efficiency of 99.87%.<br>
