Hmm.  How very... perceptive.<br>
<p>
`The Torus is alert; its blue light softens, and the tug of gravity fades:<br>
they float, enraptured and in love, and the cyborg Darkstar enters their<br>
joy without warning, terrible and ineluctable, to bear Sriyanie away. [...]<br>

`He has the guise of a huge chinchilla cat, his eyes pale chrysoprase slit<br>
by vertical dark emptiness, stiff grey hair along the spine, tail thick and<br>
white, aloft, white as the dense, beautiful fur of his body.  His voice<br>
wheezes and rasps: "Come, pretty one; come, child," and his tongue is<br>
rose-pink and minutely scaled.  [...]<br>
<p>
`After a time she says: "You are inhuman.  You are inhuman."<br>
<p>
`Four Nest adults stand at a respectful distance.  In their faces is<br>
excitement and expectation.  The cat lifts its green-golden eyes to her,<br>
and says: "We are transhuman, child.  We are entelechies.  Come, now, and<br>
greet your companions.  Your life has begun." '  (`Growing up', *Galileo*,<br>
