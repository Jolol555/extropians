<i>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of them?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; am curious to find out why I am not thinking the way other people are. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is something to think about.  If this copying and killing of one </i><br>
<i>&gt; copy could be done, I think that the copy slated for death would </i><br>
<i>&gt; quickly see your point. :)  *Before* the copying was done, the person </i><br>
<i>&gt; to be copied can anticipate being both copies, and so it seems </i><br>
<i>&gt; pointless to worry about which one dies.  Since there is only one of </i><br>
<i>&gt; said person now, and since after the copying, there will still be one </i><br>
<i>&gt; left, it seems that (s)he has lost nothing.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, there is a good fictional representation of this atitude in </i><br>
<i>&gt; _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan.  The main character keeps trying to </i><br>
<i>&gt; perform experiments on uploads of himself, and can't understand why </i><br>
<i>&gt; the uploads won't cooperate, even though HE has every intention of </i><br>
<i>&gt; doing so.  </i><br>
<p>
If I would not get destroyed by jumping into volcano and pain period<br>
would be short, I would do it now. So I'm not assuming anything<br>
original would not do if he could survive it.<br>
<p>
Why I'm thinking that I wouldn't be destroyed?<br>
Two scenarios:<br>
<p>
1) I'm tapping original in the head and saying: "I'm continuing living <br>
here. So I'm not really dying when I jump into volcano."<br>
<p>
2) Before jumping I would make backup of myself. After jumping I<br>
would be restored. Restored copy would then study 'brain tapes' of<br>
destroyed copy and try to understand how it feels to 'die'.<br>
<p>
3) Actually case 1 is almost same as 2 expect that restore is made<br>
before jump ;-)<br>
<p>
Maybe there wouldn't be any new information but at least I could say<br>
that I have died ;-)<br>
