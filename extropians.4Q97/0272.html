Unless we find a replacement for field effect transistors Moore's law will <br>
eventually come to an end, although IBM's recent technique of using copper <br>
instead of aluminum in a IC probably gave us an additional 5 or 10 years <br>
breathing room. Power dissipation in a FET can be a real problem, as is <br>
trying to interconnect billions of different transistors, even worse, when<br>
the FET channel becomes very short quantum effects start to seriously degrade <br>
performance. We can't change the laws of physics so we need a way to turn <br>
Quantum Mechanics from an enemy to a friend.<br>
<p>
Back in 1991 Craig Lent proposed we abandon transistors and capacitors, stop <br>
using voltages to encode information and start using individual electrons in <br>
a Quantum Cellular Automation (QCA). His idea was to have each cell of the <br>
automation be made of 4 quantum dots arranged in a square and have each cell<br>
contain 2 extra electrons. The electrons repel each other so they will always <br>
try to get into quantum dots as far apart as possible, that is the dots at <br>
the diagonal of the square. There are only 2 stable states such a cell can <br>
be in:<br>

<i> |             |                                            |             |</i><br>
<i> |0___________X|                                            |X___________0|</i><br>

There is no direct connection between the 4 quantum dots but the 2 extra <br>
electrons can move from dot to dot in a cell by quantum tunneling. <br>
The electrons can't tunnel to other cells in the automation (a small increase <br>
in distance means a huge decrease in the probability of successfully <br>
tunneling) but the electrons in each cell can still feel how the charge is <br>
distributed in a neighboring cell and will always stay as far apart as <br>
possible. For example if you have a long row of such cells and you change the <br>
first one to state 0 then that will change the second cell to state 0 and <br>
that will change the third cell to state 0 and so on all the way down the <br>
line. A signal sent in this way uses no current so almost no heat is <br>
generated.<br>
<p>
Because a cellular automation interacts with adjacent cells you could <br>
intertwine several such "wires" to process information. Lent also designed <br>
but did not build a quantum cellular automation adder.<br>
<p>
Six years ago not many were very impressed with Lent's idea because they felt <br>
the dots could never be made accurately enough and the slightest imperfection <br>
would let the 2 electrons leak away in about a nanosecond. In the August 15 <br>
1997 issue of Science Lent and his associates report they have actually build<br>
one cell of the automation. The cell operated just as Lent said it would, <br>
it can be in only 2 states and can stay in one state for many minutes and the <br>
electrons do not leak out.<br>
<p>
The quantum dots in this prototype are huge, 8 microns across, so he had to <br>
keep it at cryogenic temperatures, but Lent says in the article "QCA <br>
architecture is scaleable to molecular levels and performance actually <br>
improves as the size of the device is decreased. [...] a molecular sized QCA <br>
would function at room temperature." Unlike transistors, the smaller these <br>
things get the better they work<br>
<p>
In an editorial in the same issue of Science Terry Fountain of University <br>
College London call this new work "A new and promising possibility to shrink <br>
computer architecture [...] by factors as much as 50,000 compared to the <br>
smallest feasible transistor. [...] the remaining hurdles though daunting are<br>
largely technical".                                 <br>
