LS,<br>
<p>
Remember this issue? ;-)<br>
We have received quite a list of names to choose from, thanks go too all<br>
for taking the effort to write us. Traffic has slacked off somewhat the<br>
last few days and we have begun our selection proces.<br>
<p>
But:<br>
<p>
You can stil send us you ideas!<br>
They remain as welcome as ever, no matter how noisy they may be!<br>
<p>
// engage_commercial_mode //<br>
<p>
 I would like to take this opportunity to remind eveyone of the <br>
 great opportunies that await the lucky winner:<br>
 - A $100 fully digital, untracable, Amazon gift certificate<br>
 - Immortalisation on our Website (of your name and URL-of-choice)<br>
 - Our eternal grattitude<br>
 - Enhanced respect by fellow Transhumans &amp; Extropains worldwide<br>
 - General improved career opportunities<br>
 - Possibly a better sex-life<br>
 - And much more...!<br>
<p>
// disengage_commercial_mode //<br>
<p>
<p>
Any idea received before saturday (we'll stretch it to LA-time ;-) will be<br>
considered by the not-so-independent-or-impartial Jury.<br>
<p>
So give it your best shot! We can all use a hundred bucks right?<br>
<p>
<p>
On behalf of Excedo, the Dutch Transhumanist Society,<br>
Warm Regards,<br>
Arjen<br>
