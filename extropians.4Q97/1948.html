No.  This is not what I meant, though this too is possible.  The dissipative<br>
structure analogy still means that total order plus total entropy is a fixed<br>
sum.  Eventually, too, the system would run down.<br>
<p>
In the model I am using, one would not need a dump for excess entropy.<br>
Instead, the expanding space itself increases both the order the entropy.<br>
The model is called the expanding phase space idealization.  Layzer, to<br>
my knowledge, is the originator of this idea.<br>
<p>
To picture what I am talking about imagine a bunch of molecules in a<br>
box.  Let's say that at first they are all in one part of the box.  After a<br>
certain amount of time, ceterus paribus, they will be spread out -- in<br>
the sense one would be likely to find them anywhere within the box.<br>
This would be an equilibrium state -- or more, accurately, collection of<br>
states.  Now imagine that the box can expand faster than the<br>
molecules move.  The molecules will never be able to fill the whole<br>
box, in the sense of the first example.  One will always be able to<br>
give a rough estimate of where they are.<br>
<p>
Now if the universe as a whole behaved like that...<br>
