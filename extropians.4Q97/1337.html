Dear extropians and other transhuman cryonicists:<br>
<p>
This year the CryoFeast will be Co-Hosted by Alcor members in a number of<br>
locations throughout the US and across the world! <br>
<p>
The Alcor CryoFeast is a yearly party held the first weekend of December  to<br>
celebrate and toast our future and our indefinite lifespans. Others may be a<br>
little behind the times in giving thanks for the harvest;  we cryonicsts are<br>
giving thanks for the technologies that may help us to achieve indefinite<br>
lifespans.  <br>
<p>
During the 1980's and early 1990's the CryoFeast was held in Los Angeles.<br>
Timothy Leary was the host for many of these parties.  Last year, Ailing<br>
(Niki) Freemand and Tim Freeman graciously hosted the CryoFeast in the Bay area.<br>
<p>
If you are an Alcor member and would like to Co-Host a CryoFeast in your<br>
vicinity on December 6th (flexible), please contact me soonest.  We welcome<br>
everyone to participate, and even if there are just a few members in your<br>
area, or just yourself,  be a co-host anyway!<br>
<p>
Thank you!<br>
<p>
