Thanks !!<br>

I think this shows, why we need a guide or if you like a central<br>
point of information. I didn't know this stuff. And to be honest,<br>
I don't know a lot of the other stuff I wrote down, too.<br>
But I want to learn it, and I think I'm not the only one.<br>
<p>
I'm trying to contribute in building a main source for Transhumanism,<br>
nothing more and nothing less.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm to "light" for this job.<br>
( please let me know !!!!!! .......... )<br>
<p>
But at the other hand, if I understand it as newbie, I guess it can<br>
guide a lot of new people trough the learning process.........<br>
<p>
This is exactly why I want to work with numbers in front of the text.<br>
It will make it easier for people to add their opinion or additional<br>
information.<br>
<p>
My wish is to have an easy, optimistic and entertaining story that takes<br>
one<br>
by the hand and shows him all the differn't idea's, aspects, science<br>
regarding this life/universe/history/future/etc.......<br>
.....and the role of Extropy and &gt;H in all this.<br>
<p>
If your new to a lot of these "things", it's hard to find a good point<br>
to start. One that brings some structure into this scientific chaos of<br>
options and theory's :-)<br>
<p>
I firmly believe that if "we" want to spread this Transhuman way<br>
of thinking, we should try to educate as much people as possible.<br>
This can't be done by sending every one that takes a look at the list<br>
a mail with "read this book first.....", "..as XXX explained in his XXX<br>
work"<br>
Etc.......... <br>
It's all very true, but not appealling to one who is trying to get a hold<br>
on the main issue of whats going on here.<br>
<p>
The power of the bible is that it gives a complete story ! Ok, I disagree<br>
on  almost everything. But that's not the point. You want something<br>
that sets you on the road. After, you've read the introduction, you<br>
follow the suggestions one gives you.<br>
<p>
But since "we" are dogma-free, it won't be a fixed bible. Instead it will<br>
be a dynamic text, that changes every "year ?" I think the internet is<br>
the best way to distribute it on. Because you can click directly away<br>
from the topic you read onto the page with the other opinion.<br>
<p>
I hope I explained better, what I'm looking for,<br>
I also hope there are a lot of you out there with "scientific-knowledge"<br>
who will take time and effort to translate the hard stuff into<br>
a reasonably easy to understand introduction.<br>
I mean, isn't it possible that we find some general story in all this<br>
that we all can relate to in some way?<br>
We are all on this list ! that's something.............now the only thing<br>
"we" have to do is write it down in a story that can be read by<br>
joe-sixpack :-)<br>
<p>
Again, if some of you feel, I'm not the right one for the job, let me<br>
know. I accept it without a problem. I know very well I'm not even <br>
halfway there...............<br>
<p>
:-)   Have a nice weekend all !<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
