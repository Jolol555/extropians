I agree with you completely, however there are newcomers to this list,<br>
notably from countries less advanced along the siungularity curve as<br>
ours, that still don't understand or agree as to what point we are<br>
starting from. WHile one would think that the death of the Soviet Union,<br>
the end of Socialism in China and most other control economies, as well<br>
as the end of the welfare state in many western nations, would be enough<br>
of an indicator to prove the point that "free enterprise is the superior<br>
economic system", there still seem to be plenty of people on this list<br>
who refuse to learn from history, and refuse to acknowledge the truth of<br>
today's global economy. <br>
<p>
Before we can discuss where we are going, any discussion group needs to<br>
agree on where we are now.<br>
