<i>&gt;&gt; [Bill Gates's less-than-enthusiastic comment on cryonics]</i><br>

<i>&gt; Good riddance.  Hopefully Microsoft will follow suit!  No more bulky,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unstable software.</i><br>

How nice of you to wish death upon the one man who has done more<br>
for humanity than any other in history.  And I'm not just saying that<br>
because he fed me for a year.<br>
<p>
Absent actual physical coercion, absolutely anything one does to<br>
cajole as many people as possible to give you money--voluntarily--<br>
is, by definition, providing a benefit to them.  Except to the small<br>
extent of MS's government contracts (a /very/ small part of its<br>
business) which are not paid for voluntarily, every penny of the<br>
world's richest man's fortune came from people who /chose/ to give<br>
it because they derived benefit from his products.  Regardless of<br>
how grudgingly they may have felt about being locked in, or how much<br>
they lied to themselves about wanting reliable software (no one<br>
really wants reliable software, they just think they do), the fact<br>
is that they signed the checks.<br>
<p>
Despite the fact that Microsoft never really invented anything novel,<br>
ignores standards, bullies its competitors, and does lots of other<br>
things people might not like, the world would be a much darker and<br>
poorer place without heroes like Gates, who do the Right Thing for<br>
whatever reasons.  Motives don't count--results do, and Bill Gates<br>
gets results.<br>
<p>
When I awake from my suspension, I'd much rather see a world with<br>
Bill Gates than some worthless whiner like Marc Andreesen.<br>
