Pardon me, but why do you feel obligated to attach the entire content of<br>
the message you are responding to, instead of trimming out the irrelevant<br>
parts? Trimming the irrelevant parts out is generally considered good<br>
etiquette.<br>

The above is a smiley.  It indicates I am trying to be friendly, not trying<br>
to be abusive.<br>

A web search on either of the words would probably turn up a definition.<br>
They are pretty well known by most of the regulars on this list, and, I<br>
daresay, by a great many people on the 'net. I believe they're both present<br>
in the "JARGON" file, which is stored on many sites all over the world.<br>
Many people try to do a web search before asking a question like the ones<br>
you asked. It can save time for all concerned.<br>

TANSTAAFL is an acronym for "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free<br>
Lunch"--first (to my knowledge) used in Robert A. Heinlein's novel _The<br>
Moon Is A Harsh Mistress_. It communicates the sentiment that you usually<br>
get what you pay for, and that things that are labeled "free" usually have<br>
some hidden cost.<br>
<p>
I seem to recall that "fnord" comes from Wilson and Shea's _Illuminatus!_<br>
trilogy. In the novel(s), it refers to (or _is_, depending on your<br>
interpretation) a symbol/signal embedded in communications which is located<br>
directly adjacent to something that is intended to be forced out of your<br>
consciousness. For instance, the phrase "Bang, you're dead! fnord" would<br>
leave the unwitting reader feeling only puzzled and uneasy, without being<br>
able to recall what was just read.<br>
