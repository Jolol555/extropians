<i>&gt; I should point out that I am deeply opposed to taxation in any form.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, my opposition is on moral grounds--that being that taxation is</i><br>
<i>&gt; robbery. I think that using "legal theories" as a basis for not filing</i><br>
<i>&gt; returns and or not paying taxes serves only to affirm that authoritarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; law has a place in civilized society and that taxation is A-OK (they just</i><br>
<i>&gt; need an explicit law for it).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Note that, in his advertisement above, Irwin Schiff is offering</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;$50,000.00 to charity, if the "honorable gentlemen" addressed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are able to cite any "specific laws making Americans 'liable'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the cases on the website concerns a lawsuit by an attorney against</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schiff for breach of contract (failing to pay the reward). Schiff won the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case and the appeal. However, strangely, Schiff's defense was not that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; attorney did not provide proof that taxation was lawful and that average</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens are required to file and pay. Schiff's defense was that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptance of the offer was not timely (the attorney contacted Schiff after</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing a rebroadcast of the original program where the offer was made).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While it's true that you have a good chance of not getting caught if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't file, I think that has a lot more to do with the inefficiency of the</i><br>

I have read Schiff's books, and other arguments that the income tax is<br>
"voluntary"; that your income tax form can be used in court against you<br>
so therefore to prosecute someone for failure to file would violate the<br>
5th amendment; that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified, etc. <br>
<p>
There is competent scholarship to support the contention that the 16th<br>
Amendment to the US Constitution was never properly ratified by the<br>
required number of states, and the other arguments all have<br>
merit...unfortunately, that is irrelevant.<br>
<p>
As I understand it, there is a legal maxim that "specificities in<br>
evidence supersede generalities in evidence."  We all are supposed to<br>
have some general protections and rights under the constitution, such as<br>
freedom of speech.  However, if I am hired by a client and sign an<br>
agreement not to reveal his confidential information, I cannot later<br>
publish it and claim my 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech.  My<br>
general right to freedom of speech was superseded by my specific<br>
contractual agreement not to publish this information.<br>
<p>
When you open a bank account, you usually sign an agreement which<br>
includes some seemingly innocuous clause that you will abide by the<br>
rules of the bank.  If you read all the fine print you will find that<br>
you agreed to abide by all of the administrative rulings of the<br>
Secretary of the Treasury.<br>
<p>
When new Federal Judges are confirmed they are told how to manage "Tax<br>
Protester" trials -- violations of Title 26.  Federal Judges have been<br>
instructed that the Supreme Court ruled in 1896  (Davis vs. Elmira<br>
Savings, 161 U.S. 275), that banks are instrumentalities of the<br>
Congress.  In other words, the interstate system of banks is the private<br>
property of the state.  So as an operation of law, anyone who has a<br>
depository relationship, or a credit relationship, with a bank, such as<br>
checking, savings, charge cards, loans, mortgages, etc., are<br>
experiencing profit and gain created by the state.<br>
<p>
During Willful Failure to File trials the IRS surveys the local banks in<br>
the vicinity of the tax protester, and obtains copies of his signature<br>
card.  During the prosecution the Federal Judge is sitting up there on<br>
the bench with that agreement with the state in front of him while the<br>
tax protester cites his Constitutional rights. <br>
<p>
The judge will ignore all Constitutionally related arguments.  He is<br>
operating on the penal clause to a civil contract.  And since there is<br>
an agreement to be bound by Title 26, what difference does it make<br>
whether or not Title 26 was ever enacted by the Congress?  A contract<br>
does not have to be enacted by Congress in order to make it enforceable.<br>
<p>
I recommend "Invisible Contracts" by George Mercier (I found it on a BBS<br>
years ago), which goes into these adhesion contracts in detail.<br>
<p>
In the words of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: "Equity is<br>
brutal, but we are merely enforcing agreements."  Another legal maxim is<br>
that "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice."  Until we have<br>
separation of banking and state, we will not have the choice to avoid<br>
this "invisible contract"; we will not have justice.<br>
