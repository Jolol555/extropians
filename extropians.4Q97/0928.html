<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks for everyone who's contributed to my understanding.  I've still got</i><br>
a few devil's<br>
<i>&gt;advocate caveats I'm happy to be talked out of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. I agree that the still-burgeoning, information-based economy is</i><br>
fostering the profitability<br>
<i>&gt;of libertarian-style models.  But I suspect that (a) the cost/benefit ratio</i><br>
of dominating<br>
<i>&gt;others will always be more attractive than self-suffiency to a minority of</i><br>
persons willing to<br>
<i>&gt;use coercion, (b) most people will succumb to governance over self-rule (if</i><br>
handled correctly),<br>
<i>&gt; and (c) the greater the % of population willing to be governed, the more</i><br>
difficult it is for<br>
<i>&gt;those who do not wish to be governed to retain autonomy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore, I submit that although libertarianism will advance to a degree,</i><br>
it will never fully<br>
<i>&gt;replace current systems of government.</i><br>
<p>
No system of government is tyranny for those who consent to it, and no<br>
system of government is virtuous for those who do not consent. A truly<br>
libertarian society would allow communities of every sort, so long as<br>
participation is voluntary, and those communities are non-aggressive wrt<br>
other communities. The trick is to somehow devise consensual communities<br>
that are philosophical rather then geographical, wherein you and your<br>
neighbor could subscribe to different governments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. Hypothetically, if coercive government did disappear completely,</i><br>
wouldn't power-mongers just<br>
<i>&gt;switch their mechanism from coercion to persuasion?  John Clark noted that</i><br>
Germans probably<br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't have attempted genocide against the Jews en masse without the Nazi</i><br>
military machine.<br>
<i>&gt;But would a Nazi propoganda machine have been equally effective?  It's my</i><br>
understanding<br>
<i>&gt;that a large percentage of the American population believe that welfare</i><br>
recipients are<br>
<i>&gt;responsible for much of the country's ills, but have no idea that USA</i><br>
spends 150 billion/year<br>
<i>&gt;on corporate welfare.  Isn't that governance by persuasion rather than</i><br>
coercion?  And although<br>
<i>&gt;I'd like to believe that the only factor influencing the market value of my</i><br>
work is the work<br>
<i>&gt;itself, I'm fully aware that public perception of my race, gender, sexual</i><br>
preference, education,<br>
<i>&gt;etc., are extremely influential.  If any body can control the factors that</i><br>
set the prices for<br>
<i>&gt;my work, does it really matter that they use persuasion rather than</i><br>
coercion?  Is it only <br>
<i>&gt;an ethical victory, or is there something I'm not seeing?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What's the libertarian position on this?  That population control through</i><br>
media, while sometimes<br>
<i>&gt;unfortunate, is not unethical?</i><br>
<p>
Persuasion has no value except as prelude to action. If coercive action is<br>
excluded, there can be no problem.<br>
<p>
If, by corporate welfare, you mean tax cuts, you are confusing *giving* with<br>
*not taking*. If I take two dollars from you and "give" one back, I am not<br>
giving you anything.<br>
<p>
In a free and competitive market, the value of anything, including your<br>
labor, is more than the seller thinks it is worth, and less than the buyer<br>
thinks it is worth.<br>
