<i>&gt; Brian D Williams thinks censorship is moral, I think it's an obscenity.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't prove It's wrong, I can't prove murder is wrong either and don't feel </i><br>
<i>&gt; I need to, I would put both in the same category. There is no disputing </i><br>
<i>&gt; matters of taste however so I will try to concentrate on practical </i><br>
<i>&gt; considerations. </i><br>
<p>
      I think censorship is wrong, and I can prove it.  The common <br>
      regulating principle in both science _and_ morality is _truth_. <br>
      Obstructing intelligence and knowledge is wrong, and to censor for <br>
      _anything_ you have to censor _everyone_ for _everything_.  This is <br>
      why the 'kiddie-porn' hoo-ha is such a snare and a delusion.  Nearly <br>
      all the 'kiddie-porn' is produced by or with the cognizance of the <br>
      governments (and their criminal accomplices in 'organized crime', <br>
      which is 'organized' by the government -- no-one else can let them <br>
      get away with it) who then seek to 'censor' it.<br>
<p>
      In the USA, up to 90% of hardcore 'kiddie-porn' is FBI entrapment <br>
      stuff -- 'dangles.' But the great 'kiddie-porn' scare is an <br>
      indispensible pretext for getting the Federales into your mailbox <br>
      _in the first place_, where they can then go on fishing expeditions <br>
      for other things altogether.  Intrusive surveillance and Social <br>
      Control is the name of the game.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Odd, how the uptight "Moral Majority" crowd seem completely <br>
      unconcerned by 350 000 children dying hideously each day in the <br>
      world, of entirely preventable disease and malnutrition.  Photos of <br>
      children starving to death are commonplace, unremarked.  This <br>
      indifference is far more obscene than (say) Maxfield Parrish <br>
      paintings could ever be, or stills of (say) Brooke Shields in <br>
      'Pretty Baby' or 'Blue Lagoon'; or (say) Jodie Foster in 'Taxi <br>
      Driver' or 'The Little Girl Down The Lane.'<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you believe that if your children see a picture of 2 people fucking or  </i><br>
<i>&gt; even seeing the word "fuck" will ruin them for life then it's your </i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility to stop them from seeing it, not mine. Personally I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; think the matter is important so I won't lift a finger to help you, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; they're your kids so I won't try to stop you either, however if you use that </i><br>
<i>&gt; tired old excuse to limit my freedom I will fight you with everything I have, </i><br>
<i>&gt; including violence if I think I could get away with it.   </i><br>
 <br>
      Again, notice the assymmetry:  by 15, the average American kid will <br>
      have seen around 15 000 real or staged slayings.  Yet (some) people <br>
      can get all uptight about kids seeing lovemaking.  Bizarre!  If the <br>
      kids are incapable of arousal, it means little or nothing to them. <br>
      If they are so capable, what's all the fuss about?  Taboos tell us a <br>
      lot about the psychosexual hang-ups of _adults_.  Kids can enjoy <br>
      erotic experiences quite innocently.  Like Adam and Eve in the <br>
      Garden, before the Fall.  It was the Bad Guy who made them ashamed <br>
      of their natural nakedness, not God...  &gt;:-}<br>
 <br>
      And they're not 'his kids.'  On Lockean self-ownership grounds, the <br>
      kids' lives belong to the kids.  At best, the parents are trustees <br>
      and protectors and guardians.  Defending people against objective <br>
      knowledge of matters of biological necessity and good clean fun <br>
      (i.e. reproduction) seems quite utterly daft.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The man is not a war hero, the man is an actor and that's a perfectly </i><br>
<i>&gt; honorable profession. He showed intelligence in getting out of the Vietnam </i><br>
<i>&gt; war, more intelligence than most. When it's a question of survival, when a </i><br>
<i>&gt; bunch of goons want your labor and try to enslave you so you can perform a </i><br>
<i>&gt; very dangerous, unpleasant, and pointless job for them 12 thousand miles away, </i><br>
<i>&gt; you do what you have to do to remain free. I wouldn't have held it against him </i><br>
<i>&gt; if he shot off his big toe to prevent it, or bribed someone, or pretended to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be insane, or showed up at the recruiting office in a strapless evening gown.</i><br>
       <br>
      Amen to that.  I'd have killed to avoid conscription (I grew up <br>
      under its shadow).  Whereas I might have volunteered for combat jets <br>
      or some Special Forces work...<br>
 <br>
      Stripped of all the nonsense, a soldier's job is to kill.  The work <br>
      is unpleasant; it can be dangerous.  But there are worse fates.  I'd <br>
      have volunteered to fight for _his_ strategy with John Paul Vann in <br>
      Vietnam.  Read Neil Sheehan's magnificent biography, "A Bright <br>
      Shining Lie."  An intensely moving and unmissable history.<br>
