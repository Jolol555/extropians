<p>
I would not say that Canada, nor Western Europe, are explicitly free,<br>
i.e. that they do not have Bills of Rights written that are part of the<br>
Constitution of the nation. That so much speech, arms bearing, etc is<br>
limited in many of these nations "for the common good" indicates that<br>
the governments of these nations do not beleive that authority is<br>
delegated to governments by the people, or that while they may beleive<br>
this, they are able to use staged or exaggerated events (its not what<br>
happens, but what the news say happens) to aid in propaganda efforts<br>
that convince the people that they need to give up this or that<br>
increment of freedom.<br>
<p>
Considering the extremes of repression, holocaust, governmental<br>
instability, and outright warfare throughout history in this region, and<br>
even in this century alone, I think that Western Europe is a completely<br>
pathetic example of unarmed countries where freedom and peaceful<br>
coexistence is concerned.<br>
