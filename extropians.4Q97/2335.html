Concerning Midwest Extropians, there are now four<br>
people who have said they will probably be able to<br>
make it to a gathering somewhere in Chicagoland on<br>
January 10. Great! Any more??<br>
<p>
Once again, I'm going to be unable to utilize e-mail<br>
for a few days after today. Meanwhile, does anyone<br>
care to make a suggestion as to where?<br>
<p>
January 10 will be here soon, so I think it's best<br>
that we attempt to further solidify the plans.<br>
However, if you guys just want to meet and figure<br>
things out then, that's okay with me.<br>
<p>
Just to throw out ideas, how about somewhere we can<br>
play darts? Or something more elaborate like<br>
rock-climbing? (I recently had my first rock-climbing<br>
experience and loved it.) Karaoke? (Just kidding.) <br>
<p>
Hey, you other Chicagoans, help me out here. What's a<br>
good place?<br>
<p>
For anyone who might be using public transportation<br>
(bus, train), I offer to meet them at the<br>
station/terminal. That said, we don't neccessarily<br>
need to meet near any station/terminal.<br>
