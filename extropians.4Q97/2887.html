So, what is violence, and how can humans decrease the total amount of it<br>
in the world?<br>
<p>
Anders suggests that violence comes from our deeply (biologically)<br>
ingrained aggressive drives.  I agree with this.  However, most<br>
aggressive acts are not violent acts.  Aggression has more to do with<br>
being determined to get one's way in the world than with harming or<br>
destroying other sentient systems.  Although, humans who believe that<br>
others must be hurt or killed to get their way will express their<br>
aggression through violence.  Other humans aggressively pursue their<br>
studies, their carreers, their breakthrough inventions, their scientific<br>
discoveries,  their hobbies, their love lives.  <br>
<p>
So, as I see it, the problem is not aggression itself, which can be used<br>
for extropic or entropic purposes, depending on the goals and beliefs of<br>
the user of aggression.  The problem is when people believe that harming<br>
or destroying others is an appropriate and effective way of accomplishing<br>
what they want in the world.<br>
<p>
Most of our behaviors and beliefs are learned after we are born (although<br>
our fundamental drives, like our sex drives and our nourishment drives<br>
were learned through the long process of genetic evolution).  We all have<br>
conditions that we want in our lives, such as having sufficient food,<br>
being socially accepted, emotionally bonding with others, etc.  These<br>
fundamental desires are part of our evolutionary heritage, selected for<br>
because humans and pre-humans with those fundamental desires tended to<br>
have more success in surviving and reproducing than those who had those<br>
desires to a lesser extent.<br>
<p>
We have these fundamental desires and drives from the time we are born,<br>
and as we mature, we experiment with different ways of fulfilling these<br>
desires.  We cry, we get fed, or our diaper gets changed.  We reach out<br>
our hand and pick up the block we wanted, but then drop it because we<br>
didn't grip it hard enough.  We do many things which don't get us what we<br>
want, and some things that do.  And over time, our mind fine-tunes itself<br>
to our environments, and we learn many excellent strategies for getting<br>
what we want from the world.<br>
<p>
Now, the problem is that many people learn, mostly through observation of<br>
others, that violence and threats of violence are somewhat effective ways<br>
of getting others to do what they want them to.  This strategy works, to<br>
some extent, so it is reinforced.  It also tends to cause the adrenal<br>
glands to secrete adrenelin, which can be quite pleasant, so the behavior<br>
is reinforced further.  However, the violence strategy is flawed in some<br>
major ways.  The most obvious flaw is that it places the attacker in<br>
significant danger to their own life and well-being, which conflicts with<br>
their own internal drive for safety.  It also tends to encourage others<br>
to avoid them, thus conflicting with their drive for social acceptance. <br>
The violence strategy also makes it difficult for the user to bond<br>
emotionally with others since they tend to use violence most frequently<br>
against those they live with or are around most often.<br>
<p>
There's no denying that violence or the threat of violence can be an<br>
effective strategy for getting what one wants sometimes.  That's the main<br>
reason people use it.  However, in the long-run, whatever benefits were<br>
gained from violence tend to be lost, with quite a bit more lost besides.<br>
 Violence gives many short-term benefits, much like crack cocaine, but<br>
its long-term results can be quite devastating to the user, much like<br>
crack cocaine.<br>
<p>
I believe violence is a learned behavior and the idea that violence is a<br>
good solution is a common and powerful meme.  What we need are some very<br>
good counter-memes.  People need to realize that violence is not a good<br>
long-term solution.  And they need to teach their children that, and to<br>
teach them much more effective ways of getting what they want, so that<br>
violence will seem like a ridiculous alternative.<br>
<p>
Since so many people are violent, how do the rest of us effectively<br>
protect ourselves from them?  I think that part of the basic training of<br>
humans, along with communication skills, problem solving skills and other<br>
such basic skills should include highly effective self-defence skills and<br>
strategies.  People should be trained to use their bodies effectively in<br>
situations which require close, unarmed combat, and they should be<br>
trained to effectively use weapons of all sorts, especially how to use<br>
ordinary objects as weapons.  With everyone well-trained, violence would<br>
no longer be a good solution, even in the short-term, since there would<br>
be few potential victims, and the risk of trying violence would be very<br>
great, especially since any bystanders would be quite capable of<br>
apprehending you.<br>
<p>
A highly trained populace is probably the most effective way of stopping<br>
violence.<br>
<p>
So, how do we achieve that?<br>
