Counterfactual conditional statements are the basis of the logic of<br>

As I said, I'm not familiar with the source of the statement and<br>
expressions. Can the apparent contradiction be reconciled?  Maybe. Maybe<br>
not. My bet is still on maybe not. When I see "counterfactual", I see<br>
definitively, "opposed to fact." That which is opposed to fact is false.<br>
When I connect false to "processes", I arrive at false processes. When I<br>
note that false means non existing, I arrive at no processes even as the<br>
"counterfactual processes" are declared to be processes. Very strange word<br>
games and highly suspect.<br>

If this is a challenge, bring it on. You might wish to start with "The<br>
Anatomy Of Language" and The Principle Of Epistemology. If you can refute<br>
these, I will much appreciate it. If you can't, you're in for a long day.<br>
