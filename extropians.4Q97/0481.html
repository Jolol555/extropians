I believe this book is available (in entirety) on the 'Net.<br>

"The Mind's I" is philosophy of consciousness, which is intriguing - at l=<br>

when D&amp;H do it - but not core Extropy.  "G=F6del, Escher, Bach" is philos=<br>

pillar of Extropy as space travel, Libertarianism, or cognitive science.<br>

 emotional, or even metabolic, consequences.  And his heart kept beating =<br>

I fell in love with his description of uploading.  No gosh-wow, but well =<br>
and<br>
truly _*ALIEN*_.  Not to mention that he writes hard science fiction abou=<br>

speculation on the True Nature of Reality.  I'd have said that was imposs=<br>

"Quarantine" also gets high marks, but as a technical study of why you ca=<br>

I wasn't impressed.  The fiction was amateurish.  I don't recall much of =<br>
the<br>
science, but I don't recall it was impressive.  Perhaps I'm just jaded - =<br>

then, so are you.  You should really try all of these out on null-X<br>
