<i>&gt; What if some advanced civilization replaced one of your neurons with</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificial one that behaved from the viewpoint of other brain like</i><br>
<i>&gt; original. What if they replaced all neurons one by one with</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificial one. Would your consciousness change? Would your</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomenon change?</i><br>
<p>
	Yes.  I think this kind of substitution is a fallacy which<br>
would not work as many think it would.<br>
<p>
	When I am picking strawberries in a strawberry patch, the<br>
neurons in my brain produce a phenomenal green field of leaves filled<br>
with phenomenal red spots in my consciousness.  The phenomenal<br>
difference between the red and green representations are what enable<br>
me to know where the strawberries are so I can pick them.  If you<br>
replace the part of the visual cortex that would otherwise be<br>
producing the phenomenal red of a particular strawberry in the patch,<br>
it must also produce this same fundamental red experience that is<br>
integrated into our consciousness, or our consciousness would not be<br>
aware of the red strawberry and we would not be able know to pick it.<br>
<p>
	If you simulated the entire process abstractly, you could<br>
reproduce the behavior, but the subjective experience would not be<br>
there.  Once you replace the real phenomenal red with abstractly<br>
represented red, the subjective experience is gone.  You would<br>
recognize this as soon as the first part of the visual cortex switched<br>
to be abstract since it would then be a blind spot in your conscious<br>
visual awareness.<br>
<p>
	Sure, you could bypass the consciousness by enabling the<br>
abstract representations to cause the hand to move to pick the<br>
strawberry, but long before we get to this level we will clearly see<br>
what qualia are and how critical they are to behavior, intelligence<br>
and conscious knowlege.<br>
