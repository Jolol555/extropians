As soon as Max's comment came across my screen, I remarked to my roomate<br>
that while public response to this announcement was extremely<br>
predictable, I was willing to bet money that people would express utter<br>
suprise when the "backlash" occurred.<br>
<p>
As Curt says, this response is indeed nearly universal and very<br>
predictable. I rather am dismayed that people who attempt to predict and<br>
plan the future are not able to predict such an obvious reaction.<br>
<p>
Besides human-nature, Basic Economics dictates that a price increase is<br>
concurrent with a demand decrease.  By free-market standards, the<br>
increase in the cost of receiving the list will decrease its<br>
membership.  If decreasing membership is not the goal of the price<br>
increase, than it may not meet the expected goal.  Obviously, Max's<br>
original claim that the price increase would reduce noise or spam was<br>
met was skepticism.  Max's later explanation that it was really a<br>
revenue-enhancing move for ExI seems more likely, but the Public<br>
Relations or "Advertising" could have been handled more smoothly.<br>
<p>
Obviously, any price increase would mean more money for ExI than<br>
nothing.  How much of a price increase would bring the most revenue is a<br>
matter for debate.  The higher the price, the less members you get.  The<br>
lower the price, the more members you get.  This is basic free-market<br>
economics.<br>
<p>
One idea that I have not seen expressed is the implicit choice that many<br>
readers on this list have made.  They choose to read the list, but they<br>
have chosen not to join ExI.  By linking the two choices, Max is forcing<br>
people to choose whether their reasons for reading this list outweigh<br>
their reasons for not having previously joined ExI.  If this is indeed a<br>
revenue-enhancing move, I hope Max and ExI have done some market studies<br>
to support their belief that this move will have the intended result.<br>
