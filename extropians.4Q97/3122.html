Well, certainly.  My point is that it isn't only statists who talk about<br>
this kind of engineering, and also that I hope to see extropians talking<br>
more like such engineers than like Postrel does (though I fear we often do<br>
sound a bit like Postrel).  What I'm talking about here is *mimetic*<br>
engineering. You know, *rhetoric*.   Not State injunctions or anything<br>
like that.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I think you have this wrong, Statis refers to a centralized</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
This may be.  But change as such is an empty sign.  If extropians aren't<br>
*more* than just dynamists then they aren't defined as anything at all.<br>
There's more to extropian transhumanism than "Change Is Good."  There's<br>
even more to extropianism (I hope) than "God is dead," "Smash the State,"<br>
"Self Reliance," and "TANSTAAFL," but at least that's getting closer.<br>

Re-reading did nothing to allay my irritation.  Maybe because I read<br>
between the lines?<br>
