<i>&gt;&gt; Things evolve for a purpose.  If you look at any living thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you can clearly see that.  Perhaps they did come to be just to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; replicate, but I think the idea that they came about as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; natural means of controling population is just as feasable.</i><br>
<p>
No, it's not feasible at all, because "purpose" and "means"<br>
requires the existence of a volitional being to have a purpose<br>
and to choose means.  To assume that evolution has a purpose<br>
is a contradiction in terms: it is theism.  Evolution, when<br>
understood correctly as simply an inevitable mathematical<br>
consequence of certain initial conditions, explains precisely<br>
how their can be such wonderfully conplex things as people<br>
and viruses which /appear/ to be designed for a purpose<br>
without requiring the existence of a designer or purposes.<br>
<p>
It's really not that difficult a concept once you put your<br>
mind to it.  Dawkins is, of course, one of the best explainers,<br>
but it really was Darwin who made the important conceptual<br>
leap that made it possible once and for all to get rid of the<br>
silly ideas of "God" and "nature" that kept us in the dark.<br>
