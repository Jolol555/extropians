Being ignored doesn't discourage some people.  Paying money may<br>
discourage some, encourage/self-justify others.  Filtering, however,<br>
does work.  Really.  My life is much nicer with 24 people sent to<br>
/dev/null.  14 people receive my much tighter list of selected<br>
messages.  Filtering people based on whether they pay money is a crude<br>
filter; it tells me something about their committment, possibly, but<br>
nothing about their quality.  It may be a good tool for some face to<br>
face clubs with no alternative.  Here, however, I can filter people<br>
directly based upon my perception of their quality.  Much more subtle.<br>
