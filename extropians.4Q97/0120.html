<i>&gt; } &gt; How nice of you to wish death upon the one man who has done more</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt; for humanity than any other in history.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Newton and Darwin did rather more, among others.  James Watt?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Adam Smith?  Tom Paine?  The inventor of the alphabet, if there was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; single one?  </i><br>
<p>
Some of those are candidates: I might take Darwin, in particular.  Let me<br>
rephrase my statement to "...has done more for the people /of his time/<br>
than anyone in history."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } &gt; absolutely anything one does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt; cajole as many people as possible to give you money--voluntarily--</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt; is, by definition, providing a benefit to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; } What benefit are con artists to their victims?  </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps your dictionary doesn't include "voluntarily"?  I said<br>
cajole, not defraud.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } &gt; When I awake from my suspension, I'd much rather see a world with</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt; Bill Gates than some worthless whiner like Marc Andreesen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; } Pardon my ignorance... who's Marc Andreesen?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Backer of Netscape.  I'm not sure why he's a whiner; he may have asked</i><br>
<i>&gt; for an antitrust judgement against Microsoft.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the founder of Netscape.  I call him a whiner because the moment<br>
he found Microsoft making money doing exactly the same thing he did--<br>
breaking the standard to lock people in--instead of fighting it out<br>
in the free market like a man, he ran running to daddy government to<br>
make the bully go away, and he continues to fight his battle in the<br>
courts instead of the free market.  Netscape is also a much more<br>
blatant liar about their support of open standards than MS is.<br>
