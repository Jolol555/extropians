In a message dated 97-10-26 19:08:42 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;What's a linear motor?<br>

 It's short for `lint-in-your-ear motile oratory'.  Ancient Atlantean<br>
 wizards used this method to fly into orbit after the earth had expanded too<br>
 much and destroyed their homeland.  The method is now known only to a few,<br>
 but appears to have involved an occult practice of meditation in which the<br>
 side of the head was lowered until the ear rested on the navel.  Lint was<br>
 then drawn into the cavities of the ear by specially trained earwigs, and<br>
 the coded messages buried in the DNA strands of the lint were chanted until<br>
 the adept rose into the heavens.<br>

Umm, ok, I take it you're making fun of me, trying to anyway, dumb example,<br>
because I dont know about the atlanteans and the earth expansion thing is<br>
science fact.  I had this argument with yall once, and then another time<br>
someone said I refused to look at concrete evidence, well, you cant get more<br>
obvious than fitting together pieces like a puzzle!  Im referring to how the<br>
only way for our continents to fit into the original land mass is for the<br>
earth to be 80% of the size it is today (im talking perfectly, otherwise<br>
there are spaces that get larger the further you go towards the poles, only<br>
to be relieved if you REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH), I mean, HELLO?????<br>
 There it is in front of your eyes!<br>
<p>
now i have no idea what a linear motor is, and although im interested, you<br>
dont have to tell me what it is if you dont want to, although I would<br>
appreciate it if someone did.<br>
