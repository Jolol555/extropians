Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;any radical fem, for reasons having nothing to do with family, their</i><br>
<i>&gt;main arguments for opposing PK read to me like the same sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;doublespeak we are seeing here in the "property is theft" thread.</i><br>
<p>
I missed that thread, but as I understand it the main reason for <br>
feminist opposition to PK is the overt statements of the leadership <br>
regarding the status of women in the family--mainly that the men <br>
should take back control (not ask, take).  On the other hand, as <br>
noted by several prominent feminists this week, if a membership in PK <br>
results in the man being more attentive and caring and responsible to <br>
his family, then that improves the situation of women, men and their <br>
children, and it's difficult to argue with that.<br>
