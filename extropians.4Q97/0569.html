In order to think about the notion of "objective morality",<br>
I've ended up fixing upon two concepts, value-set and<br>
value-system.  I define the "value-set" and "value-system" of <br>
an entity as follows:<br>
<p>
The value-set is the set of things that "feel good" to the<br>
entity. To be more precise: imagine a list pairing off<br>
various experiences with their qualitative feel: painful,<br>
pleasurable, etc. Just which qualitative feels should be<br>
regarded as assignments of value is an interesting question. <br>
Maybe "pleasure" and "pain" between them cover everything, <br>
maybe not. I do think there are some "qualitative feels" which<br>
aren't assignments of values - for example, perceptions of color.<br>
Even if you fear blue, perceiving something as blue is not<br>
an assignment of value - fearing the thing because it's blue is.<br>
<p>
The value-system is the set of all those principles for *acting*<br>
(or all those dispositions to act, in the case of an unconscious<br>
value-system), which will help determine whether the entity<br>
has "good" or "bad" experiences. For example, "Act so as to feel <br>
good". Another interesting question: does any entity ever make<br>
a choice that's not a product of its value-system? Or is there<br>
a logical identity between "choice" and "act determined by a<br>
value-system"?<br>
<p>
What does it mean for something to "have value"? The only<br>
answers I can think of are (i) it appears in a value-set<br>
(as defined above), or (ii) it plays some role in a value-system <br>
(for example, helps bring about situations in the value-set).<br>
So if "being good" is a form of "having value", I don't see<br>
any way to give it meaning except by referring to *some*<br>
entity's experiences or preferences. In particular, I<br>
don't see how one can judge one value-system to be better<br>
than another, unless one has a value-system to judge by.<br>
As far as I can see, this is completely non-paradoxical,<br>
but it does imply that there are no facts of the form<br>
"Morality A is better than morality B", only facts of the<br>
form "Morality A is better than morality B, according to<br>
morality C".<br>
