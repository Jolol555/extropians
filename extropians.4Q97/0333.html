We're back to the question: is this a clubhouse or an outreach group?<br>
<p>
If it is a clubhouse, you can never guarantee that someone won't try to<br>
argue with that loud oafish drunk who crashed the party--unless you *EJECT*<br>
the loud boor. Somebody has to function in the capacity of bouncer, or you<br>
takes what you gets.<br>
<p>
If it is an outreach group, people are supposed to help the clueless.<br>
<p>
I too want the s/n level to increase. But wishing it won't make it so. If<br>
it is the intention of the kind folks who keep this list going that anyone<br>
may join, no one will be expelled for violating the ground rules, etc.,<br>
then you get whatever/whoever shows up.<br>
<p>
I admit to following up posts I probably shouldn't--but my purpose is to<br>
hone skills and vent, not necessarily in that order. :) <br>
<p>
I see no general solution. Some places have a PLEDGE (BIX, at least in some<br>
conferences)--it's a pre-emptive *PLONK* for talked-to-death topics--but it<br>
still failed of automatic function--people were always reminding each other<br>
about the PLEDGE. Might be worth a try.<br>
<p>
I don't see any movement toward a tokens system, or tougher standards. I<br>
don't see a solution that doesn't have potential negative consequences--a<br>
Secret Masters of Extropy list would have to be secret, or it would run<br>
some risk of being labeled exclusionary. Which it would be. But that's the<br>
point--if "exclusionary" is a swear word, we're doomed.<br>
<p>
I think we4 need a real answer from every participant and lurker on this list:<br>
<p>
Clubhouse? Press 1 on your touchtone phone now...<br>
<p>
EI members only? Subscription? What?<br>
