Nick: Thanks for retracting the point about the relation between<br>
Extropianism and detailed political views.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Extropianism is defined by the Extropian Principles. Those principles do</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; specifics of anarcho-capitalism, as defining ideas. The Principles convey</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; certain shared attitudes and values that make one an extropian, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; specific beliefs about the best organization of political or economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; institutions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not even the belief that something broadly like libertarianism is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;good thing? There has been some debate on whether this list is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate forum for discussing "basics", and I got the impression </i><br>
<i>&gt;that this in practice ment arguing about the merits of </i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarianism. I think several people scolded Erik Moeller about </i><br>
<i>&gt;that about half a year ago, though I didn't follow the thread very </i><br>
<i>&gt;closely.</i><br>
<p>
No, not even the belief that libertarianism is a good thing. Libertarianism<br>
is quite strictly defined (even though there are different ways of defining<br>
it). I don't think it would be accurate to call any view that allows *any*<br>
taxation to be libertarian. Any form of taxation seems to violate<br>
libertarian principles. Even minimal statists (like Rand) try to find<br>
non-coercive (by the libertarian standard) methods of financing their<br>
minimal state -- user fees directly for services, lotteries, etc. The<br>
Extropian Principles affirm a valuing of spontaneous order and<br>
self-ownership. While, again, most of us might call ourselves libertarian,<br>
it seems to me perfectly possible for someone to affirm those principles<br>
yet not count as a libertarian.<br>
<p>
Here's a possible extropian who is not a libertarian: This person affirms<br>
all the principles. She thinks free markets are, overall, the finest<br>
mechanism for coordinating activity and that government coercion is<br>
generally a bad thing. She opposes government ownership of business and<br>
favors practically no regulation other than the enforcement of private<br>
property rights. (Libertarian prefer not to describe this as "regulation".)<br>
But she believes education vital to extropian goals and does not believe<br>
that it will be adequately provided if left entirely to voluntary action.<br>
She sees state schools as a disaster and so opposes government-run schools,<br>
but favors taxation to fund education vouchers to be used at private<br>
competitive institutions. After carefully examining the evidence, she<br>
regards global warming and ozone depletion as real threats. While in almost<br>
all cases she thinks pollution and resource problems are best handled by<br>
careful definition and enforcement of private property rights, she thinks<br>
that approach will not work in these cases and so favors international,<br>
governmental action.<br>
<p>
Such a person, who can strongly favor spontaneous order and self-ownership<br>
but who allows some role for government beyond that of the strict<br>
libertarian view, can be an Extropian. The Extropian Principles suggest<br>
certain attitudes and values that we affirm, not specific political<br>
implementations. <br>
<p>
As for Eric, he went much further than suggesting that a totally "pure"<br>
market economy might not work well. He was heavily statist in a way that<br>
seems to me to go well beyond possible compatibility with extropian<br>
attitudes. He clearly opposed spontaneous order and self-ownership in so<br>
many ways that he definitely was "debating the basic." The basics are<br>
Spontaneous Order and Self-Ownership, not libertarianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Certainly, you cannot uphold Spontaneous Order while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wanting an all-powerful state that directs all activity centrally</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As a clarification: Could a person who held the following belief be </i><br>
<i>&gt;an extropian: "The likely only way to avoid a nanotechnological </i><br>
<i>&gt;disaster ending life on earth is if there is a world-wide </i><br>
<i>&gt;dictatorship, where the dictator coerces people into following his </i><br>
<i>&gt;will. So I believe in dictatorship and coercion"?</i><br>
<p>
While the Principles do not specify specific political implementations,<br>
there will certainly be political systems that clearly conflict with the<br>
attitudes and values expressed by the Principles. We cannot draw a sharp<br>
line to separate those polities incompatible with the Principles from those<br>
that are compatible. Obviously there is a fuzzy region, not a sharp<br>
boundary. A Stalinist system, or a system of strong state control of many<br>
aspects of life would clearly conflict with the two SO principles.<br>
<p>
Your specific example above is set up so as to be more tricky. (Nick, I can<br>
tell you're a philosopher from the way you set this up!( It's like asking a<br>
peaceable person whether they would kill someone in a lifeboat situation.<br>
You're specified that a worldwide dictatorship is probably the only way to<br>
avoid a catastrophe. *How* likely does this have to be? IF someone really<br>
held this belief, then if survival is the primary value, and if they<br>
thought dictatorship would not forever end their extropian goals, I suppose<br>
they could support that system temporarily while seeking a better solution.<br>
However, I doubt that any of us believe dictatorship is the only way, or<br>
the best way, or even a workable way of avoiding such a danger. Under<br>
anything remotely like normal assumptions, no, an Extropian could not<br>
advocate dictatorship and still reasonably call themselves extropian.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyhow, I now think the following is an accurate statement of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the difference between transhumanism and extropianism (though perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt;not one that is very useful for newbies):</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropianism is transhumanism plus the claim that the Extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;Principles (by Max More) are right. Thus you can't be an extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;without being a transhumanist, but you may be a transhumanist without </i><br>
<i>&gt;being an extropian.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds pretty good. One caveat: I wouldn't put it in the form that<br>
"the Extropian Principles are *right*. That suggests a view of values as<br>
objective. That is obviously a highly controversial matter. (Note to<br>
Delmar: I haven't forgotten to respond to your long post. It's on my list!)<br>
I'd rather say that Extropianism is transhumanism in the specific form of<br>
an affirmation of the Extropian Principles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are people who could be called</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;transhumanists who apparently do not value critical thinking, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;who look to scientifically implausible methods for overcoming human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;limits. As our ideas spread, I expect to see religious versions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;transhumanism -- Christian Transhumanism, Islamic Transhumanism, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(not too far from their current beliefs) Mormon Transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I disagree. As you wrote yourself in the Extropian Principles 2.6:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"transhumanism values reason and humanity and sees no grounds for</i><br>
<i>&gt;belief in unknowable, supernatural forces externally controlling our</i><br>
<i>&gt;destiny"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore I don't think that christians, muslims or mormons could be </i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanists. I think we should rule that out in our definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the term "transhumanism"</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a really important issue for the propagation of<br>
transhumanism. I think you may be right about standard Christians, Muslims,<br>
and Mormons. After all, Muslims believe fundamentally in submission to<br>
Allah. That and typical Christian beliefs in an active God whose plan for<br>
us must be followed clearly does conflict with transhumanism. Your citation<br>
of my passage suggests that.<br>
<p>
However, I do not think we should rule out everything called "religion" as<br>
being compatible with transhumanism. "Religion" carries multiple meanings.<br>
If we take it merely to involve a belief in a god who created and designed<br>
the world -- as the deists believed (as distinguished from theists who<br>
believe in an active god who expects worship and who defines morality),<br>
then I don't see this as incompatible with transhumanism. Though I see no<br>
reason to believe it, it *could be* that our universe was designed by a<br>
being in some kind of "higher" reality. Moravec suggests that our universe<br>
could be a simulation in the higher-dimensional computer of a superbeing.<br>
While I don't grant such an idea any credence, I can't rule it out. If a<br>
transhumanist believed such a thing (more strongly than the evidence<br>
suggests) I would think them uncritical. But I wouldn't see such a belief<br>
as incompatible with transhumanism so long as the person didn't look to<br>
this being for guidance or purpose.<br>
<p>
"Religion" also (and I think more essentially) involves a *way* of<br>
believing. Religion involves faith -- a belief in things in the absence of<br>
or contrary to the evidence. In that sense, religious thinking clearly<br>
cannot be reconciled with the rationalist approach of transhumanism.<br>
<p>
The question is: Can any actual religions be held compatibly with<br>
transhumanism? I retract my previous suggestion: Standard Christianity and<br>
Islam cannot be compatible. (Though, and this is important, one can be<br>
mostly transhumanist and extropian and Christian. David Ross seems to be an<br>
example of this. I find his combination of beliefs thoroughly odd and<br>
mysterious but he seems quite happy believing in the divinity of Jesus<br>
along with uploading, physical immortality, and the importance of reason.)<br>
Hinduism, in some of its variations, might be compatible with<br>
transhumanism. I'd be interested in what others think of this. Are there<br>
other practices counted as religious that might not conflict with<br>
transhumanism?<br>
<p>
Consider also that there have been religious humanists, such as Pico Della<br>
Mirandola. He clearly held many tenets and attitudes that we call humanist,<br>
yet he believed and praised a creator. He saw that creator as having given<br>
us a unique nature such that we could choose whether to become more<br>
animal-like or to evolve higher. His views did not support any passive view<br>
of life. If you grant that there can be religious humanists (even if you<br>
don't count them as totally "pure" humanists) perhaps there can be<br>
religious transhumanists (though you may not count as pure as secular<br>
transhumanists).<br>
<p>
So, I think that religious faith is incompatible with transhumanism, but I<br>
would not feel confident declaring that all specific religious beliefs are<br>
incompatible.<br>
