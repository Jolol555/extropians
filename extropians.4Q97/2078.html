Is this an average? Or is it true in almost all economies? Does the share<br>
get split evenly right from the start, or does it go more to one factor at<br>
first?<br>

<p>
I'm surprised and not convinced without seeing the data. Even if true,<br>
clearly there are cases of convergence. Have factors been identified which<br>
mark the few cases of convergence from the majority of cases of continuing<br>
divergence? (I suspect I know what some of those factors are, but I'm<br>
interested in what the literature says.)<br>

<p>
As someone else asked, how could controlling birth rates boost growth?<br>
Surely the opposite? More births means more growth in the long run at<br>
least, as there are more people producing, and more specialization, and<br>
bigger domestic markets.<br>
<p>
Thanks for the tidbits of info, Robin. If you have time to answer these<br>
questions, I'd like to see what you say.<br>
