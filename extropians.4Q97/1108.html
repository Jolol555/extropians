Actually, just the other day, The Learning Channel had a program on<br>
entitled "Unnatural Science" which discussed Dr. White's research in<br>
addition to other controversial topics such as cloning and germ-line gene<br>
therapy.  They had video of the transplanted monkey head, I believe the<br>
monkey survived for a month (not sure about the amount of time but it was<br>
significant) although it couldn't move it's new body.<br>
<p>
Dr. White was forced to stop his research in this area due to death<br>
threats by animal rights activists and a lack of funding.  He is<br>
considering resuming his research on "total body transplants," as he<br>
prefers to call it, at a Ukrainian neurosurgery facility.  You can read a<br>
brief article that contains most of the same information at:<br>

<p>
A quick search of medline turned up the following articles, which someone<br>
with an interest and access to a medical library might be able to look up<br>
(and summarize for the list - please!)<br>
<p>
"Selective hypothermic perfusion of canine brain." White RJ, Takaoka Y;<br>
Neurosurgery 1996 Dec; 39(6):1271<br>
<p>
"The isolation and transplantation of the brain. An historical perspective<br>
emphasizing the surgical solutions to the design of these classical<br>
models." White RJ, et al.; Neurol Res 1996 Jun; 18(3):194-203<br>
<p>
"Postulates for brain transplantation. [Editorial]" White RJ; Surg Neurol<br>
1991 Feb; 35(2):164<br>
<p>
"Brain transplantation." White RJ; Surg Neurol 1985 Apr; 23(4):449<br>
<p>
"Primate cephalic transplantation: neurogenic separation, vascular<br>
association." White RJ, et al; Transplant Proc 1971 Mar; 3(1):602-604 <br>
<p>
There were some additional articles that looked interesting, but these<br>
seem to be the most relevant.  The first article, I assume, is regarding<br>
the short-term cooling of the brain during surgery, but I wonder if it<br>
would be at all applicable to cryonic research?  I believe the final<br>
article is the one in which Dr. White reports the full body <br>
transplantation.<br>
