You might consider a discounted subscription for those who will not be<br>
able to take advantage of any of the other benefits due to location etc.<br>
and who do not want another paper publication - in other words a<br>
listmember-only rate (perhaps "associate" vs. "full" membership ala ACM or<br>
IEEE but less costly and no magazine :-)<br>
<p>
Splitting the list up would be more confusing for reasons already given<br>
(dual posts, cross posts etc).  <br>
