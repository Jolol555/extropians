The most recent Extropy Investment Group met this past Tuesday evening to<br>
discuss investment strategies and favorite money market picks.  Several<br>
attended came with pertinent information about their own investments<br>
experiences.  We did discuss new technologies and investing in same.  My<br>
contribution was a list of ten "Mighty Great Mutual Fund Picks" with the<br>
objectives, NAV, and percentage gain for 1 and 3 months, and also 1, 3 and 5<br>
year gains. Others brought suggested reading, personal strategies, and goals.   <br>
<p>
Feedback for the meeting was good. Many felt the learned a lot.  Because<br>
some people had been investing for years and quite successful at it, and<br>
having the money to invest (a necessity), some had no investments yet, and<br>
were just starting out.  One thing that we all agreed on was that we have to<br>
start putting money aside, now.  I'd like to suggest to the list that it<br>
might be really a good idea for extropians in local areas to form their own<br>
EIG meetings and perhaps we could pool information.  <br>
<p>
Its a positive way to advance our money-making intelligence and learn about<br>
investing in the technologies and companies that are aligned with our way of<br>
thinking.<br>
