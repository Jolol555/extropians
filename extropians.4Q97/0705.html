<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;You need to get out more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Curious.  I've always regarded that as the mating cry of the braindead.</i><br>

Lee Crocker responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Thanks.  That phrase has always disturbed me too, but I could never</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite put my finger on why.  Now it's clear: it is used by those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;regard social interaction more highly than private intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;pursuits; perhaps because they lack confidence in their own abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt;and seek approval.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; Go ahead, insult me.  I can take it.<br>
<p>
Onward.<br>
<p>
I beg to differ -- your thesis is anything but "clear".  When I say it, I mean<br>
that the person I'm saying it to has lost sight of the importance of balance<br>
in life.  Introspection alone cannot reveal reality -- you have to go look at<br>
it.  And while reading and writing are valuable, people wrote the books and<br>
people read them, and words on paper cannot convey the richness of human<br>
experience and interaction.<br>
<p>
Also, by "getting out" I may mean just to go take a walk on the beach; breathe<br>
some fresh air; get some exercise; look at some flowers or rainbows or art or<br>
architecture; or (gasp) touch somebody -- you're still a human, as much as<br>
you may dislike that, and touch is good for humans.<br>
<p>
Lee, do you think I write this stuff so you'll approve?  You need to get<br>
out more.<br>
<p>
