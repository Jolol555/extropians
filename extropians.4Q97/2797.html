<i>&gt; &gt; that Western Europe had a substantially different face when he was alive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's yours?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Canada?  Well, I live here in fact.  Last month, a bunch of 13 year old</i><br>
<i>&gt; girls broke another girl's legs with baseball bats (please note:</i><br>
<i>&gt; baseball bats are sporting equipment, not weapons?) then threw her into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lake to drown in the small, peaceful town of Victoria, British Columbia.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My point?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a) Anything can be a weapon, you can't get rid of</i><br>
<i>&gt; them, so there's no point in saying "it's too soon to say."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; b) Canada is not the peaceful little place you think it is, and the peace</i><br>
<i>&gt; you do see is definitely not the result of a lack of guns.  The only way</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can stop people from hurting each other is if you put everyone in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own padded cell.  Guns just make the process less painful for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; victim. (would you rather be shot in the head or stabbed to death?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Conclusion:  There will always be weapons(even if it's just a big rock</i><br>
<i>&gt; off the ground, or your fist), ergo the only way to stay free</i><br>
<i>&gt; is to arm yourself against those who would oppress you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Having spent fair amount of time traveling through Canada, and knowing a<br>
few Canadians extremely well, including a few former girlfreinds, I<br>
would say that the main reason Canada is so peaceful is, and you are<br>
going to call me racist or something for this, is because it is,<br>
compared to the US, so ethnically homogenous. Minorities are extreme<br>
minorities in Canada, for the most part, and have been that way for so<br>
long that Canadians have never felt threatened or needed to feel<br>
xenophobic, except possibly toward native Canadians, or between the<br>
French and English speaking populations. This is changing, though, as<br>
evidenced by the increases in the asian and islamic populations and<br>
concurrent rises in crime in the areas where these minorities are<br>
concentrated.<br>
<p>
ANother big factor I can't identify in words, but it is definitely<br>
related to the Canadian psyche and is possibly the same reason why<br>
during the American Revolution, the Canadians did not join in the<br>
revolt.<br>
