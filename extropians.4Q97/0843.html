Even if Ambrose is an MI6 asset he seems to be just<br>
what is needed!   But contrary to his nonsense about<br>
the "little people" defending liberty conflict at the top<br>
is all that stands between where we are and total tyranny.<br>

AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD -- 10/26/97<br>
===================================<br>
Abbreviated Transcript of C-Span Interview<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Portions of remarks made  by  London Telegraph newspaper reporter<br>
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (AEP) during  an  appearance  on  C-Span,<br>
October  26, 1997, appear below.  By way of introduction, here is<br>
a partial review  by  Conspiracy  Nation of Mr. Evans-Pritchard's<br>
new  book,  *The  Secret   Life   of   Bill   Clinton*.    (ISBN:<br>
0-89526-408-0)<br>
<p>
Let's  get  two  things  straight:   (1)  the  London   Telegraph<br>
newspaper  is  *not*  a "tabloid"; it is a *broadsheet*.  It does<br>
not feature pretty girls in bikinis  on page 3; it is a respected<br>
British newspaper having a circulation of about 1 million readers<br>
per day.  During the years immediately before World War  II,  the<br>
Telegraph   sided   *with*   Winston   Churchill   and  *against*<br>
"appeasement" of Nazi Germany  on  the march.  (The London Times,<br>
however, sided with the Neville Chamberlain "appeasement"  policy<br>
which,  we  know,  was  a  big  mistake.)   The  London Telegraph<br>
newspaper has been around  since  1855,  and anyone who regularly<br>
visits their  web  site  knows  they  consistently  do  excellent<br>
reporting  on a wide variety of issues.  (2) Just because Ambrose<br>
Evans-Pritchard is British does  *not*  mean he is therefore with<br>
MI-6.<br>
<p>
Reacting to Evans-Pritchard's book,  *The  Secret  Life  of  Bill<br>
Clinton:   The  Unreported  Stories*,  one  Internet  commentator<br>
called the London journalist a modern Alexis DeTocqueville.  This<br>
is  an  apt  description:   Evans-Pritchard,  visiting  our land,<br>
travelling through it, and jotting down his observations, gives a<br>
keen outsider's sketch of  the  United  States,  as it is, in the<br>
mid-to-late 1990s.  Do not be misled by the title  of  the  book.<br>
*The Secret Life of Bill Clinton* is not about "Clinton bashing,"<br>
*per  se*, but portrays the larger situation of an elite class --<br>
Democrats and Republicans --  full  of decadence, corruption, and<br>
snobbery, and stubbornly resisted by the  common  people  of  the<br>
United  States.  The heroes of AEP's book are the ordinary people<br>
who, against all  odds,  have  successfully "monkey-wrenched" the<br>
plans  of  their  "betters"  to "manage" the country.  Yes, there<br>
have been defeats.   But  AEP's  larger  point  is  that, even in<br>
defeat, there has been a wide-ranging RESISTANCE which  has  most<br>
definitely  slowed the enemy's advance.  And there have been many<br>
victories in some of the  minor  skirmishes, too, detailed in Mr.<br>
Evans-Pritchard's book.<br>
<p>
The one critique I have of the book is in  its  coverage  of  the<br>
Oklahoma  City  bombing(s)  case.   It carefully demonstrates the<br>
ineptness  and  even  cover-up  occurring  in  the  so-called FBI<br>
"investigation," but the author does not come to grips  with  one<br>
aspect  of  the  case:   the  fact that explosives must have been<br>
placed directly *on*  the  support  pillars  of the doomed Murrah<br>
Building.  (We know this from expert analysis done  by  Brigadier<br>
General (retired) Benton Partin.)  Since charges were placed *on*<br>
the  support  pillars, the next question (not noticed by AEP) is,<br>
"How did  the  'rogue  terrorists'  involved  gain  access to the<br>
building?"  Unfortunately, Mr. Evans-Pritchard misses that in his<br>
otherwise good analysis.<br>
<p>
The  book, as is to be expected (since it is written by an author<br>
who has achieved cult status  amongst researchers into the hidden<br>
ways of the U.S. government), breaks a lot of  new  ground.   The<br>
book  gets  the  "gears  turning"  in  one's  mind.   Aspects  of<br>
revelations   Evans-Pritchard  has  surfaced  may,  circumstances<br>
permitting, be touched on in  future issues of Conspiracy Nation.<br>
But this underground news  outlet  can  not  possibly  cover  the<br>
entire  eruption of previously-suppressed information provided by<br>
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.  People  routinely ask, "Gee, Conspiracy<br>
Nation, but what can *I* do?"  What can you do?   Buy  this  book<br>
and keep it on the best-seller lists.<br>
<p>
Transcript<br>
----------<br>
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard interviewed on C-Span, 10/26/97<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: Why is Oklahoma City such a focal point of the book?<br>
<p>
AEP:   Well,  I  think something that hasn't been reported to the<br>
American people is, many of  the  families have filed a number of<br>
lawsuits against the federal government, alleging that  [the  OKC<br>
bombing(s)] was a sting operation or, at the very least, that the<br>
government  was  negligent  --  had  some responsibility for what<br>
happened, perhaps had  a  degree  of  prior  knowledge.  It was a<br>
broader conspiracy, and they haven't been told the full truth.<br>
   The families [of the victims], many of them, are  very  angry.<br>
One  family  in  particular,  Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost 2<br>
grandchildren in the daycare  center, conducted their own private<br>
investigation for 2 years.  And they  feel  that  the  government<br>
covered  up the true story; that it was a broader conspiracy, and<br>
that it was  probably  a  sting  operation that went disastrously<br>
wrong, and they've not come clean about it.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  Mr. Evans-Pritchard is a reporter, based in London.   He<br>
spent some time here in Washington.<br>
<p>
AEP:  I did four-and-a-half years as the Washington correspondent<br>
for  the London Sunday Telegraph.  And I've now returned, and I'm<br>
writing about European affairs for the Daily Telegraph in London.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  Last  Monday,  syndicated  columnist  Robert Novak wrote<br>
this piece, "A Sting Operation Gone Awry."  And  he  talks  about<br>
Andreas  Strassmeier,  "a  former  West  German  army  lieutenant<br>
illegally in the U.S."  Who is he, and why is he important to the<br>
bombing?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Tim McVeigh telephoned him 2 days before the bombing, after<br>
he  had  called the Ryder Truck rental agency.  And that's how he<br>
got drawn into the  whole  question  of  the bombing in the first<br>
place.  [Strassmeier] spent 8 years in the German army.   And  he<br>
told  me  he'd  had  intelligence  training  and  he'd  done some<br>
intelligence work in the German army.   And he came here with the<br>
intention of working undercover for the U.S. Justice  Department.<br>
And  he  admitted  that to me.  So it's quite significant that he<br>
should figure as  a  character  in  the  extended McVeigh circle.<br>
He's also been named by an undercover informant of the ATF, Carol<br>
Howe, as somebody who's stirring up  race  war  and  a  terrorist<br>
campaign against the U.S. government.  Now with his background, I<br>
find  it  very  hard  to  believe  that  he's  a genuine neo-Nazi<br>
terrorist (which is how he presented himself.)  I suspect that he<br>
was here on some kind  of  undercover mission; whether it was for<br>
the German government, or the United States government, or  both,<br>
I  don't  know.   My own conjecture (I can't prove it) is that he<br>
was a joint asset, penetrating the neo-Nazi far right.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  You devote a fair amount of your time to a  lot  of  the<br>
conspiracy theories we hear, on this network, and read about from<br>
time  to time in different publications.  Vincent Foster:  Was it<br>
suicide, or was it murder?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Well, I don't answer that question.  What I say is, Kenneth<br>
Starr's investigator, the prosecutor  he appointed to re-open the<br>
case, came to a different conclusion.   He  told  Kenneth  Starr,<br>
after  a  4-months  investigation,  there was serious evidence of<br>
foul play.  His name is Miquel  Rodriguez.  He went to Starr.  He<br>
told Starr what he'd uncovered during his investigation using the<br>
grand jury.  And Ken Starr looked the other way!  He didn't  want<br>
to  hear  it!   He  didn't  want  to  deal with it.  So Rodriguez<br>
resigned and went back to California.   And that is the only time<br>
that it's ever been seriously investigated.  After that,  it  was<br>
all damage control.<br>
   So  I  don't  feel that Ken Starr has the authority to deliver<br>
the report that he's delivered.  I  don't think he answers any of<br>
the questions; it's just a re-hash of the Fiske report, which was<br>
incredibly weak.  And  he  selectively  uses witness testimony to<br>
support his case.  And the  people  who  are  familiar  with  the<br>
archive  of  documents  in  this  case  are amazed that he's just<br>
ignored a colossal amount of evidence.  And he's ignored what the<br>
crime scene witnesses said.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  So what is your  conclusion about the Clinton presidency<br>
so far?<br>
<p>
AEP:  In terms of the  scandals,  or  in  terms  of  its  general<br>
performance?<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: Well, in terms of this book.<br>
<p>
AEP:   My  conclusion is that he's a very, very corrupt man.  And<br>
it's partly  a  generational  thing.   I  think  that the current<br>
generation in power (not just in America, but in most  industrial<br>
countries)  has  lost  its  honor code.  It's lost its integrity.<br>
Bill Clinton is the emblem of that.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  You write that, "If President Clinton eludes justice, at<br>
least it can  be  said  that  his  destructive influence has been<br>
checked." Checked by whom?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Well, the good side of this book (it's not all negative) is<br>
that the ordinary people of America have held  the  line:   we've<br>
seen  it  with  the families in Oklahoma; we've seen it, in other<br>
people, throughout the  book,  who  are  *resisting* the abuse of<br>
power, in their little  corner.   Not  always  successfully,  but<br>
they're  impeding  what I consider to be a decadent and dishonest<br>
leadership class from  dragging  this  country  down in terms of,<br>
into a Banana Republic.  The ordinary people are the ones who are<br>
going to save America and not allow it to go the way  that  other<br>
countries  have  gone  when  its democracy has been threatened by<br>
internal decadence.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  Briefly, *why* did  you  write  this  book, and who were<br>
your sources?<br>
<p>
AEP:  There are very few un-named sources in the book; almost all<br>
of it has got named sources.  So people can make a judgement  for<br>
themselves, on how they want to evaluate it.<br>
   I  first  got dragged into this morass when I started going to<br>
Arkansas and talking  to  ordinary  people  there.  And it became<br>
quite clear to me that a lot of very bad things  had  been  going<br>
on  for  the  last  10  or  15  years.   It had become a haven of<br>
narcotics trafficking.  And the more  I looked into it, it seemed<br>
to me the  political  machine  in  Arkansas  was  involved.   And<br>
there'd  been  a  lot  of mis-use of the criminal justice system:<br>
people had been  intimidated,  people  had  died.   And I started<br>
looking into these issues and I...  Well, there was no going back<br>
after that. I got drawn right into the middle of it.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  Explain this picture [on book cover]:  why was it taken,<br>
and why is it on the cover?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Well, I can't answer that, because I've only just  seen  it<br>
myself.   I  came over from London on Thursday night.  I've never<br>
seen the book before.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  The picture,  of  course,  of  First Lady Hillary Rodham<br>
Clinton whispering into the ear of President Clinton.   Was  that<br>
taken at the White House?<br>
<p>
AEP: I must find out. It's terribly negligent of me not to know.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:   You,  in a number of instances, use the term, "abuse of<br>
power." Who has the power? And who's abusing it?<br>
<p>
AEP:  It's about...  It's more than just Clinton.  It's about the<br>
whole power structure in the United States.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: But who, specifically?<br>
<p>
AEP:  The Justice Department.  The FBI.  The political class as a<br>
whole.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: So who's calling the shots?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Very good  question.   It  appears  that [these things are]<br>
orchestrated  by   the   highest   levels   of   the   FBI,   FBI<br>
Counter-Terrorism in Washington.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  Did anyone in the Clinton White House, either current or<br>
former, co-operate with you on this book?<br>
<p>
AEP:   [Slight chuckle] They stopped co-operating with me quite a<br>
long time ago.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: Why?<br>
<p>
AEP: I think they found that they couldn't really "spin" me.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN:  You're now back  in  London.   Did  that have any direct<br>
relation on this book?<br>
<p>
AEP:  If I was an American journalist (and I'm pretty critical of<br>
the American press)...  But I can see all  the  constraints  that<br>
they're  working  under.   It's  quite difficult to challenge the<br>
entire power structure.  (Which is  what  I've done in this book.<br>
It's  not  just  attacking  Clinton;  I'm  pretty  tough  on  the<br>
Republicans as well.)  You kind of "burn your  bridges"  and  you<br>
lose your friends.  It's very difficult for a journalist to write<br>
that type of book about their own country; they can't continue to<br>
operate  and function, as a journalist.  If I did this in London,<br>
about the British power structure,  I really couldn't continue to<br>
work there. So, leaving [America] sort of made it easier.<br>
<p>
C-SPAN: How does all of this connect to the President?<br>
<p>
AEP:  Well, he's...  All these things  have  happened  under  his<br>
watch.  Waco happened under his watch; it's the worst... it's the<br>
Wounded Knee of the 20th century.  It's the worst abuse of power,<br>
in  terms of number of people killed as a result of an act by the<br>
government.  And he never  dealt  with  it!  He, instead of heads<br>
rolling and people being brought to  account,  he  went  out  and<br>
tried the victims.<br>
   And  so  that  set  in motion the militia movement.  It set in<br>
motion, to some degree,  the  domestic  terrorism that the United<br>
States now suffers from (including the Oklahoma  bombing.)   This<br>
happened under his watch!  (Although there are deeper forces that<br>
have  been  at  work  for  many,  many years, that contributed to<br>
this.)  I'm not sure it  would  have happened if Paul Tsongas had<br>
been elected president.<br>
