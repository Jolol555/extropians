<i>&gt; How is recognizing actor-action assumptions different</i><br>
<i>&gt; from recognizing nouns and verbs?</i><br>
<p>
Not at all; that's rather my point.  All languages I know<br>
about (admittedly few) have such assumptions, and contrary<br>
to your assertion, Lojban does not, though I have been<br>
unsuccessful so far in showing that.<br>
<p>
Ironically, you make a very good argument for UG, but not<br>
by the content of your text; by the very fact that such<br>
an intelligent mind still maps the Lojban concepts of<br>
sumti and bridi onto the traditional actor/action form<br>
of most languages--when no such mapping is necessary or<br>
implied by the language in any way--demonstrates how<br>
wired-in that structure is.  It may well be that I and<br>
other Lojban speakers also internally make that mapping<br>
when we produce sentences; but that is a function of how<br>
our brains are wired, not something that actually exists<br>
in the language itself.  In my more lucid moments, I can<br>
see the difference, and I can construct bridi without<br>
consciously mapping them to actions.  Maybe I'm just<br>
fooling myself and my mind is doing it subconsciously.<br>
<p>
Lojban sumti are pretty damned noun-like, and if pressed I<br>
would have to admit that I really don't see a difference.<br>
But bridi (predicates) /are not/ verbs; they do not have<br>
anything at all in their nature that implies action, actors,<br>
location in time, or any of the other trappings of verbness<br>
from other languages.  If it were only the case that Lojban<br>
was simpler at using words in multiple roles but still had<br>
the same roles, you're right that that would be a minor<br>
tweak, hardly worthy of study.  But that's not the case.<br>
Lojban bridi really are different.<br>
<p>
Your examples of languages without an explicitly spoken<br>
copula are interesting, but in those languages the copula<br>
is exceptional in that regard.  Many other verbs--even<br>
those that express very non-verb-like things like spatial<br>
relationships, properties, associations, etc., are still<br>
expressed in a verb-like way (or else escape doing so by<br>
using the copula): "I belong to this group" (as if that<br>
were an action I'm taking, not a state of existence),<br>
"This document supercedes that one" (as if the documents<br>
were actor and acted upon), "I married Jane" (not referring<br>
to the ceremony but the state), "Stones surround the fire"<br>
(as if it were their choice). <br>
<p>
The verbness of some of these constructs is more apparent in<br>
some languages than others (for example, in German or Russian<br>
the nouns would be declined to label which thing the "actor"<br>
in these sentences), but the languages involved have<br>
structures designed for prototypical actor/action type verbs,<br>
and that accommodate other ideas into that form.  Even when a<br>
pseudo-verb like the copula is omitted, the language still<br>
identifies who's doing the is-ing and who is is-ed (though<br>
they may "mark" this with nothing more than word order.<br>
Lojban regrettably has to put sumti [predicate-arguments]<br>
into some order simply to serialize them, so there will be<br>
some hidden implications of word order.  Theoretically, a<br>
non-serial representation of Lojban without the problem<br>
would be possible).<br>
<p>
So while I agree that verbness may very well be built into<br>
the way our brains work, I'm not ready to give up on a better<br>
idea just yet, because I /can/ see the difference, and I<br>
think humans (if not me, then maybe my children or a later<br>
enhanced me) will be able to use this structure as easily as<br>
I use verbs.  I'm not yet convinced that this isn't possible,<br>
and I think it's important because language is by far the<br>
single most important technology we have, and optimizing it<br>
is likely to produce great benefit.<br>
