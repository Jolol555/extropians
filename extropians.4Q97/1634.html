<p>
I was reading _Invertabrates_ by Brusca and Brusca, a very large and<br>
good book which has a small but informative section on cephalopods,<br>
last night.  It seems all cephalopods are carnivores.  This should not<br>
be viewed as a problem, since so are many human pets (dogs, cats)<br>
and one variant of humanity (Eskimoes).<br>
<p>
The octopus has the largest brain of all the cephalopods and from the<br>
diagrams and text (they did not give any numbers), its brain appears<br>
much larger than a squid's.  The squid's brain does not even come<br>
close -- more like comparing a human's brain to that of a mouse.  This<br>
is probably because of the phylogenetic relationship being very distant.<br>
 <br>
(Brusca and Brusca are big on phylogenetic classifications -- one<br>
reason I bought the book.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Octopi apparently need to keep their brains segmented so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they can squeeze through tight spots.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know.  The octupus brain is really not segmented in any insect<br>
like sense.  It is pretty concentrated, though split into a few lobes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think that this is probably the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;major stumbling block to their natural evolution toward greater</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;intelligence. While their coral habitat enabled them to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;excellent spatial problem solving skills, their need to squeeze through</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;spaces is an environmental limitation on further brain integration.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure.  I think that the separation between lobes is not the<br>
result of this, but is merely an historical artifact.  The octopus brain<br>
is basically the mollusc brain that has become more centralized.<br>
There is no reason, for now, to think that this process of<br>
centralization is NOT ongoing -- i.e., that given enough time, the<br>
octopus' descendants will have a more integrated brain.<br>
<p>
At least, this fits well with my understanding of evolution, viz. as <br>
basically a process which is very dependent on initial conditions<br>
and, ergo, very conservative in this respect.  If this is so, it may <br>
only be necessary for us to tweak the parameters a bit to<br>
cascade the octopus brain into something much more powerful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Anyone developing greater intelligence in octopi would need to teach</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;them tool using strategies for fishing to overcome the expected mobility</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reduction a larger more integrated brain would entail. Possibly weaving</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;nets with seaweed. squeezing a big brain through a small space would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;probably cause as much brain damage as a heavy weight boxing </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;match.</i><br>
<p>
I would expect sentient octopi to switch behaviors to more efficient<br>
ones.  However, I am not sure if a larger brain or merely a more <br>
integrated one would adversely affect their mobility.  In other words, <br>
I question Lorrey's hypothesis that a larger or more connected<br>
brain would suffer damage in the usual contortions current octopi<br>
do.<br>
<p>
Even so, if he is correct, I would expect that whoever does the<br>
uplifting should try to be certain that the results (sentient octopi)<br>
can survive outside the lab.<br>
<p>
A more daunting problem is that octopi do not seem to care for<br>
their young in the way that other proposed candidates  -- e.g.,<br>
chimps or dolphins -- for uplifting do.  The problem of each new<br>
octopi, if this seemingly nonsocial lifestyle is maintained after<br>
uplifting, having to learn everything on its own would make for<br>
some limits on their potential.<br>
<p>
However, perhaps some form of  socialization is possible, even if<br>
only in adult life.  How might this come about?  Is it really<br>
necessary?  If the goal here is only to do experiments so that<br>
humans can be better augmented, this is not a pressing concern.<br>
If the goal is to create sentient octopi who can grow even further<br>
and mingle with human and posthuman culture, then it might be<br>
viewed as very pressing.<br>
<p>
I say we just start doing it, and tackle each problem as it<br>
becomes a limit to further advances.  Thus, the first order of<br>
the day is to learn more about octopi and start enlarging or<br>
intergrating their brains.  Worry about the rest later.<br>
