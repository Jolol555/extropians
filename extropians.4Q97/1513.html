: Because why are so many European governements privatising things like<br>

<p>
Perhaps I exaggerated a bit; but why did they take control over transport<br>
in the first place?<br>

: Of course it is a US-interest to keep as much of the world more or less<br>
: capitalistic, you make products, you need customers to buy 'em.<br>
<p>
It's more the reverse, in my view: we like to buy stuff, so we need<br>
producers to sell to us (in exchange for our products).  Trade policy<br>
that emphasizes exports is foolish: you can't eat exports.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: If the US had not fought the Cold war (and WW-II) many more people would<br>
: have died. There was no alternative, you can't coexist with the likes of<br>
: Stalin and the German guy. You win the war or you get dead/annexated<br>
: (almost as bad).<br>
<p>
And if we'd let the Georgian and the German beat on each other for<br>
a few more years, before we intervened?  We might have been rid of<br>
both of them.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: But maybe I still do not fully understand anarchocapitalism. In such<br>
: a society, without a state of any sort, who makes and upholds laws?<br>
: or is it every person for him/herself?<br>
<p>
Most law enforcement *is* at the individual level.<br>
You have locks on your doors, no?<br>
<p>
Theoretical sketches: David Friedman, _The Machinery of Freedom_.<br>
Practical examples: Bruce Benson, _The Enterprise of Law_.<br>
Fictional hints: Neil Smith, _Converse and Conflict_;<br>
	Neal Stephenson, _The Diamond Age_.<br>
<p>
: How do you go from the present situation to such a system?<br>
<p>
That's the hard part!  The important thing is to prepare the culture,<br>
to teach people that obedience to the State is not the same thing as<br>
justice; that the State is not something divine and eternal, but a<br>
creation of imperfect men, which ought to be discarded - not merely<br>
reformed - when it proves destructive to the purposes for which it is<br>
generally held to exist.  When enough people understand that, we can<br>
build parallel institutions, to be ready when the State is weakest.<br>
<p>
Most "revolutions" simply take the apparatus of the pre-existing State<br>
and give it new commands - not only because the apparatus is convenient<br>
to the conquerors, but also because most people can't imagine living<br>
without their favorite state office (and there's already a supply of<br>
bureaucrats who know how to run that office!).<br>
<p>
My dream is to build free institutions *beside* the State, in no way<br>
dependent on it, so that if the State should crumble we'll be no more<br>
disturbed than if some big corporation - AT&amp;T, let's say - goes out<br>
of business.  (I don't mean to imply *no* disturbance.  If AT&amp;T crashes<br>
millions of people will be inconvenienced for a few weeks, but there<br>
are other wires.)<br>
<p>
: Are these questions explained in a practical manner in any of the books<br>
: on the Extropian Reading list? (no I haven't read them all, still busy)<br>
<p>
(has anybody read them all??)<br>
