<i>&gt; At the source threw in the particle you wanted to transfer, measured</i><br>

<i>&gt; then coerced the other particle and photon into the appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; state.</i><br>
<p>
	That's not what I read from the descriptions.  From what I<br>
understand you do have to transport the two "entangled" photons to the<br>
source and destination.  But once the source photon interacts with the<br>
photon being copied the orientation information is spontaneously<br>
transmitted(?) to the other "entangled" photon regardless of it's<br>
distance.  The way you put it it sounds like you have to communicate<br>
the orientation information to the destination photon and then set<br>
that destination photon orientation based on this communicated state<br>
information which would be meaningless.<br>
<p>
	From what I read in the description in the article you could<br>
preload a pipeline of "entangled" photons going to the source and<br>
destination of distant communication points.  Then once the entangled<br>
photons started arriving at the source and destination, you could then<br>
communicate by setting the orientation of the entangled photons at one<br>
location and have the corresponding twin photon on the other side of<br>
the galaxy spontaneously reveal the info about the particular state of<br>
the source photon which could be galaxy away.  i.e. faster than light<br>
communication.  Sure you have to preload the pipelines, but once this<br>
is done why is this not faster than light communication?<br>
<p>
	Could it be that the orientation cannot be set at either<br>
distant location, but wrather that it's state can be observed or<br>
"collapsed", and that the particular random collapsing would<br>
correspond to the entangled photon a galaxy away?  This might make<br>
more sense, and would definitely not be communication.  But, if this<br>
is the way it behaves what's the big deal?  This sounds like nothing<br>
but quite basic Newtonian stuff to me.<br>
<p>
	And how would any of this phenomenon be used in some kind of<br>
"quantum computer"?<br>
