<i>&gt; &gt; How nice of you to wish death upon the one man who has done more</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wow! (I think that's already been said ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I never really thought of any one person doing more for humanity than any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other in history.  Bill Gates is an interesting choice.  If I had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose, I would say the most important man in history would be someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; spread the most infectious pro-science, pro-free market,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pro-individualist memes. (any ideas?)  Although he is a good model of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern capitalist (exluding government deals), I wouldn't say there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; too many people out there who have been profoundly influences by his</i><br>
<i>&gt; memes.  Maybe I'm wrong?</i><br>
<p>
Whether you love him or hate him, that act or feeling indicates that you<br>
have been profoundly affected by him. Only those who have never seen a<br>
computer in their lives haven't been directly affected by him. Even they<br>
still have been affected by him indirectly by the changes in the people<br>
they deal with who have been directly affected by him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Absent actual physical coercion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is a hypnotic or subliminal advertisement "physical coercion"?</i><br>
<p>
I personally think so, while others here do not. it could be said that<br>
your volunteering to expose yourself to subliminal coercion by using<br>
media sources that employ them is your own waiver of caveat emptor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; absolutely anything one does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cajole as many people as possible to give you money--voluntarily--</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is, by definition, providing a benefit to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What benefit are con artists to their victims?</i><br>
<p>
A victim of a con artist is merely a student getting an informal,<br>
involuntary, education that they obviously need very badly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see what you are trying to say, but I think you have made too general a</i><br>
<i>&gt; statement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe you could make a more specific economic statement like : "Humanity</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaps the greatest benefits when the market is consistently cleared</i><br>
<i>&gt; (supply=demand) and productive output per capita is maximized."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Except to the small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extent of MS's government contracts (a /very/ small part of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business) which are not paid for voluntarily, every penny of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world's richest man's fortune came from people who /chose/ to give</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it because they derived benefit from his products.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can't argue with that.  I don't really wish death to Microsoft, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy competition.  Maybe Linux will go public? (or has it already?)  Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, if I really want competition that badly, I'll have to start</i><br>
<i>&gt; writing that new OS right now...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Regardless of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; how grudgingly they may have felt about being locked in, or how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they lied to themselves about wanting reliable software (no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; really wants reliable software, they just think they do), the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is that they signed the checks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be an example of positive feedback: the more people have Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt; software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)</i><br>
<p>
I can. If a company, like Corel, would sell competetive software that<br>
wasn't even more bug infested than Microsoft applications. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Despite the fact that Microsoft never really invented anything novel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ignores standards, bullies its competitors, and does lots of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things people might not like, the world would be a much darker and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; poorer place without heroes like Gates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But not necessarily Gates.  If Gates didn't do it, someone else probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have.  The question is: would they have done a better job?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who do the Right Thing for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whatever reasons.  Motives don't count--results do, and Bill Gates</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gets results.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; When I awake from my suspension, I'd much rather see a world with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Bill Gates than some worthless whiner like Marc Andreesen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Pardon my ignorance... who's Marc Andreesen?</i><br>
<p>
Head of Netscape.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (maybe this is a good example of who has had the better memes?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; geoff.</i><br>
