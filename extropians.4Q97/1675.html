  IAN: While I think there a deeper issues<br>
  here then TWA 800, such as logical analysis<br>
  and questioning of authoritian-truth decrees,<br>
  I agree that this is getting too much. I felt<br>
  the need to post some explanations for the <br>
  recent CNN flap, and I feel, swept up by <br>
  the "energy" of it I posted too much. <br>
<p>
  But I did not initiate debate on the topic.<br>
<p>
  I have made my case available at my webpage<br>
  I encourage people to read it there, not <br>
  compel me to make the case here by ad<br>
  hominem attacks on my person. <br>
<p>
  For those who want to challenge my claims,<br>
  study the case and publish a rebuttal in<br>
  an appropriate forum.<br>
<p>
  All I can say is if you base your opinion<br>
  on what you now hear in the news, your<br>
  selling yourself short. I believe it wise<br>
  to always second guess the authorities,<br>
  and speak out when their words don't <br>
  match the facts. That's what I've done.<br>
  Unfortunately, considering the extent<br>
  of attacks on me, I wish I had not.<br>
<p>
  It would be nice if people would examine<br>
  the facts,  the message and not always<br>
  examine and attack the messenger, but <br>
  alas, that seems to be the rule.<br>
<p>
