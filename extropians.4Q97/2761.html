<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I absolutely agree.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But *how* to change the way people think?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A dream: take over all the media and any educational institution and</i><br>
<i>&gt; flood "society" with good information that makes them more critical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; More realistic: talk to as many people as you can. Doing that you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) make a few (very few) actually change the way the think</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) get better in achieving 1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) make up your own mind about the things you talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt; another possibility is writing articles, books, etc. (or creating</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer games) that contain certain messages. Let the critical</i><br>
<i>&gt; characters win, while the others fail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been thinking about this a lot (unfortunately, I didn't get to read</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot about it, yet). I believe that there are different "levels" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reach people:</i><br>
<i>&gt; With some people, you can actually start a "philosophic" discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, some people - even if they understand the concept - won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; change because they think that philosophy has nothing to do with real</i><br>
<i>&gt; life. Others simply aren't interested in that kind of conversation, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; either you tell them stories with a message (I recently found out that</i><br>
<i>&gt; most communication among friends is about their experiences, things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; happened to them recently - simply stress the "extropic aspects" in such</i><br>
<i>&gt; conversation), or you "live as a good example". It makes a great</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference, whether you tell people something, or if people ask you, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are successful and happy and such a nice person ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, with these steps, you only reach a few people - but that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; way better than reaching no one at all. If we are lucky, some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have the idea of also spreading "good memes" which may result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; snowball effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; To scare them? To lie to them? To tell them guns have demons in them</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make you kill people when you're pissed off in traffic?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what (so-called) governments have been trying for millenia. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; does work for some people, but I rather live among critical people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; know why they're doing what (fear and misinformation are pretty unstable</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or to tell the whole truth, and get people "evolved" (bad word:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "post-evolved" might be better) to a point where violent acts aren't</i><br>
their<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; first resort during a bad-hair day?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I favor the latter. That means getting everyone rich and calm, AND not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trying to screw each other. Including not lying to each other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So far, I see the major problem in the addiction of some people to</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintain power, while others prefer being ruled to being</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-responsible. Those "power-addicts" would do anything just to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; their power (including the use of violence), while some of those who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; ruled maybe develop aggression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, those in power ("governments", media, enterprises) usually</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't try to get across messages who may result in self-responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who are critical about everything because that would destroy any</i><br>
<i>&gt; centralized power. The only thing I believe I can do about this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; become rich and powerful myself and "do a part of the job" (and I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; never expect anybody else to do anything about it - if someone does, I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciate it).</i><br>
