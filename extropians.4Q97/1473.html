It would appear from cumulative evidence provided by the USDOE, the =<br>
USDOT and various Asian and European University and industrial research =<br>
centers that possibly Michael might be in error.<br>

Apparently, most new fuel cell technologies use hydrocarbon fuels =<br>
somewhat more efficiently than internal combustion engines and polute =<br>
substantially less or not at all. It would also appear that as the =<br>
technologies develop, the probable efficiency of hydrogen activated fuel =<br>
cell systems will increase substantially.  Methods are also currently =<br>
being perfected to store hydrogen fuels simply and efficiently as well.<br>
<p>
The effects of this technology -- and other alternative fuel and energy =<br>
producing technologies -- are beginning to move along far faster than =<br>
was expected several years ago. I suspect, however, that the political =<br>
constraints that might be imposed by existing vested interests in the =<br>
petroleum industry might have some temporary effects on the implimenting =<br>
of these technologies.=20<br>
<p>
Particularly, our policies towards oil producing nations in the middle =<br>
east will have to be completely re-evaluated during the next ten years. =<br>
The general economic and industrial implications must also be =<br>
re-considered. From the standpoint of social and political policymaking, =<br>
I suspect that there will be substantial changes in our multinational =<br>
