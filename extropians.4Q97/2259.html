<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Please state _one_ scientist whose work has been under the same scrutiny </i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; peer-review as IPCC publications that dares to stake his reputation on </i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; theorie that the CO2-increase of the last 200 years is preventing another</i><br>
<i>&gt; ice-age.</i><br>
<p>
	I think the point is that there are many theories that come into fashion, <br>
and decompose with time.  They usually say we need to use big government to <br>
force everybody to do this or stop doing that.  A couple of decades ago, <br>
the fashion was overpopulation.  People (still touted as experts) would <br>
claim mass starvation, disease and a lack of fresh water were just around <br>
the corner.  Once again, we have people saying that, in spite of the lack <br>
of evidence, we need governments to limit freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And the fact that this argument is never heard in discussions at policy</i><br>
<i>&gt; level might be an indication that it is not taken seriously by the broad</i><br>
<i>&gt; community of scientists (even PR-people of big oil companies _never_ use</i><br>
<i>&gt; this argument!).</i><br>
<p>
	I don't see how the purposes of "the big oil companies" (why does <br>
big=bad?) would be served by stating that burning oil changes the climate. <br>
 Seems like a mighty silly thing to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, there's no certainty yet. I do not think we can afford to wait for</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute, 100% certainty.</i><br>
<p>
	Of course not.  That's a very important part of these things.  Time to <br>
limit freedom now, before we can find out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Current extinction rate is anywhere from 10 to 40 species per</i><br>
<i>&gt; _day_.</i><br>
	<br>
	Where did you obtain this info?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Exacly, if the current trend does not change we'll have burned 300 </i><br>
million<br>
<i>&gt; years of solar energy in about three centuries. It's been a nice </i><br>
kickstart<br>
<i>&gt; for out technical civilisation but we have to find better alternatives </i><br>
pronto.<br>
<p>
	And we will.  If 90% of our oil reserves were to be suddenly gone, I <br>
suspect we would rapidly make adjustments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, better to use them for plastics and composite materials.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So how are electric cars doing? I understand Ford has a model that is </i><br>
ready<br>
<i>&gt; to be _used_.</i><br>
<p>
	I've always wondered if people that favored electric cars so much realize <br>
how toxic batteries are, and that the electric plant burns coal to generate <br>
the electricity to power them.<br>
<p>
	Being in tune with the auto industry (here in Detroit, it's tough to avoid <br>
it), Ford has a car.  It carries a boatload of batteries (toxic waste).  It <br>
hits a top speed of 10 miles an hour, and needs to be recharged every 30 <br>
minutes.  Or something, I must admit I cannot recall the exact details. <br>
 Generally speaking, it couldn't replace the average gas-guzzling, <br>
smoke-belching, rust-bucket of doom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Live as though you will die tomorrow.</i><br>
<p>
	This would almost contradict your concerns :).<br>
