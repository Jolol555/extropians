<i>        &gt;objective morality wouldn't be a force pervading the Universe for        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Good, just an objective method of labeling events "good" or "evil". </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Then even if you succeeded in your task all you would have done is provide <br>
an objective definition for the words "good" and "evil", but no reason why <br>
you should do good and avoid evil and thus no reason to favor one definition <br>
over another. Dreaming up objective definitions is no great trick, that's why <br>
I said "an" objective definition not "the" objective definition. For example, <br>
"good is white and bad is black", that's about as objective as you can get <br>
but because, as you say, "white" is not a force pervading the Universe there <br>
is no urgency in only doing white (or good) things in my daily life. <br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;Does the existence of "objective cardinality" cause there to be more         </i><br>
<i>       &gt;of things?</i><br>
<p>
               <br>
Yes. You're talking about "things" so I must assume you're talking about <br>
finite numbers because there is no proof there is an infinite number of any <br>
thing. If two finite sets could be put into a one to one correspondence and <br>
yet one set have more members than another then logic would not work in this <br>
alternate universe and the phrase "more of things" becomes gibberish.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you went to an alternate Universe where numbers did not exist,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;how would things be the slightest bit different?</i><br>
<p>
               <br>
But I couldn't go there because then there would have to be at least 2  <br>
universes and 2 does not exist, the only thing that does is the null set.<br>
               <br>
<p>
      +&gt;&gt;Alternate conversation:      <br>
      +&gt;&gt;Obviously "Objective Reality" isn't being defined as what causes the      <br>
      +&gt;&gt;neural events that I experience as belief, but in some different way. <br>
               <br>
  +&gt; Obviously, and for that very reason it's equally obvious to me that   <br>
  +&gt; whatever "Objective Reality" is defined to be it should have no interest   <br>
  +&gt; to you.<br>
               <br>
<p>
Quite correct, if you were to define "Objective Reality" in such a way that <br>
the neural events in my brain were not part of it then I would have no <br>
interest in "Objective Reality".<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just because you can't think of something [Objective Morality]         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;doesn't mean it isn't there.  </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
That's certainly true, but in the case of objective morality I don't even <br>
want to try to look for it because I can't see any puzzle it could solve if I <br>
found it. Again, that doesn't prove such puzzles are nonexistent but there <br>
are plenty of very difficult problems that I already know for a fact to exist  <br>
and life is short.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;My ethical imperatives are all interim solutions and are presented         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;as such.  Wouldn't the Universe be a much nicer place if everyone         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;else did the same?</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Your ideas about what is ethical and what is not are similar to my own  <br>
(except for your belief that a crack neighborhood is as bad as the Holocaust),  <br>
and yes, I think that if most people behaved as we do then the Universe would <br>
be a much nicer place, but other people have a different opinions and may not <br>
even want to live in a nicer place.                <br>
