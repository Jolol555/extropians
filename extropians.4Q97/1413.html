Whoa.  You want the program to be HELD IN MEMORY?  What happens if it<br>
gets swapped to disk?  Do you think silicon transistors are better at<br>
retaining identity than the magnetic disk surface?<br>
<p>
Suppose you were running as a program, on a time sharing system, and<br>
you're cool about it.  "No problem," you say, "since I'm being held<br>
in memory between run slices."  "Hate to tell you this," I say, "but<br>
actually this OS swaps you to disk between runs.  You've been swapped<br>
in and out a dozen times during the last three seconds."  What do<br>
you say?  How do you react?  Do you believe that you've been constantly<br>
dying?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and starting </i><br>
<i>&gt; *another* program while stopping the first permanently.  We often </i><br>
<i>&gt; think of two copies of a program as being 'the same' when in fact </i><br>
<i>&gt; they have features that differ (location, frex).</i><br>
<p>
Now suppose you're running on a network.  "No problem," you say, "since<br>
I'm 'the same' program each time because I have the same location."<br>
"Hate to tell you this," I say, "but that network is shared with a few<br>
hundred other programs, and the set of processors you're running on<br>
is constantly changing.  Sometimes you're using these processors here,<br>
sometimes those over there, sometimes it even pulls in some units from a<br>
loaner system at the local data bank.  Your location has shifted 100<br>
times since we've been talking."  What do you say?  How do you react?<br>
Do you consider that you've been constantly dying with each shift in<br>
location?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would say that such a person has participated only once. :)  The </i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that he has memories which are taken from previous people </i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't mean that he *is* those people.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes, one of the ground rules is that we're avoiding saying that<br>
A *is* B.  All I meant was that he has memories of having gone through<br>
this experience multiple times.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Assuming that someone who may exist in the future will think that </i><br>
<i>&gt; they are me doesn't really help me accept the idea that *I* should be </i><br>
<i>&gt; killed after the copy is made. </i><br>
<p>
Suppose you knew someone who was afraid to fall asleep, because he was<br>
convinced that every time he fell asleep he died, and a new version of<br>
him awoke in the morning - someone who had all the same memories, but<br>
a new person nonetheless.  How would you try to persuade him that he was<br>
mistaken?<br>
