Okay, I think I'm getting this Libertarian stuff.  "Violence ethical only when used to defend<br>
<p>
personal liberties" - check.  "Digital cash and other new technologies make it difficult for<br>
<p>
traditional governments to control the currency of power" - check.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks for everyone who's contributed to my understanding.  I've still got a few devil's<br>
<p>
advocate caveats I'm happy to be talked out of:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. I agree that the still-burgeoning, information-based economy is fostering the profitability<br>
<p>
of libertarian-style models.  But I suspect that (a) the cost/benefit ratio of dominating<br>
<p>
others will always be more attractive than self-suffiency to a minority of persons willing to<br>
<p>
use coercion, (b) most people will succumb to governance over self-rule (if handled correctly),<br>
<p>
 and (c) the greater the % of population willing to be governed, the more difficult it is for<br>
<p>
those who do not wish to be governed to retain autonomy.<br>
<p>
<p>
Therefore, I submit that although libertarianism will advance to a degree, it will never fully<br>
<p>
replace current systems of government.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. Hypothetically, if coercive government did disappear completely, wouldn't power-mongers just<br>
<p>
switch their mechanism from coercion to persuasion?  John Clark noted that Germans probably<br>
<p>
wouldn't have attempted genocide against the Jews en masse without the Nazi military machine.<br>
<p>
But would a Nazi propoganda machine have been equally effective?  It's my understanding<br>
<p>
that a large percentage of the American population believe that welfare recipients are<br>
<p>
responsible for much of the country's ills, but have no idea that USA spends 150 billion/year<br>
<p>
on corporate welfare.  Isn't that governance by persuasion rather than coercion?  And although<br>
<p>
I'd like to believe that the only factor influencing the market value of my work is the work<br>
<p>
itself, I'm fully aware that public perception of my race, gender, sexual preference, education,<br>
<p>
etc., are extremely influential.  If any body can control the factors that set the prices for<br>
<p>
my work, does it really matter that they use persuasion rather than coercion?  Is it only <br>
<p>
an ethical victory, or is there something I'm not seeing?<br>
<p>
<p>
What's the libertarian position on this?  That population control through media, while sometimes<br>
<p>
unfortunate, is not unethical?<br>
<p>
<p>
-k.<br>
