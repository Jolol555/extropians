<p>
You can't, not then, only when records are compared is the change obvious. <br>
There is absolutely no doubt that it is possible to change things far away <br>
much faster than light, with infinite speed in fact. This is not just theory, <br>
it has been proven experimentally, but unfortunately that's not enough to <br>
sent a message. A message must not only make a change but also provide a <br>
standard the change can be measured against, otherwise the message will look <br>
random. Let me give a specific example.<br>
 <br>
Some physical processes produce 2 photons that have the same polarization but  <br>
move in opposite directions. A billion years before I was born somebody in  <br>
the Virgo Cluster started making pairs of photons that have identical but  <br>
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion   <br>
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in   <br>
the opposite direction from the earth also a billion light years away.   <br>
<p>
A billion years later on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  <br>
record its position, observe if the photon made it through the polarizer or <br>
not and record that too, the exact time also. Now I spin the polarizer again  <br>
and do the same thing for the next photon and then for the next several <br>
thousand photons.  I know that at the same time I'm doing this a friend of <br>
mine in the Coma  Cluster is performing the exact same experiment on his <br>
stream of photons and I decide to  visit him. I get in a space ship with my<br>
records and blast off for the Coma Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.<br>
<p>
After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my   <br>
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the    <br>
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising <br>
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding.  <br>
The square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon  <br>
pair is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my <br>
friend's detector.<br>
<p>
I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was   <br>
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. But this effect <br>
can not be used for faster than light communication because before I arrived <br>
with my records the results of my friend's experiment looked random to him, <br>
half the time a photon made it through his detector and half the time it did <br>
not. It's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can  <br>
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that <br>
turning my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons <br>
far away. In a way you could say that I did send him a message faster than <br>
light, but it was encrypted and can only be read when I send him the key at<br>
light speed or less.<br>
<p>
Actually cryptography is one area where this effect does have a practical <br>
value, you can use it to make a communication link that is as secure as the <br>
laws of physics, it's already been done. I wrote about Quantum Cryptography <br>
in a post about a year ago, if anybody's interested I'll dig it out.<br>
