Just speaking very generally, it seems that in many of your<br>
interests, you would be assisted by a general theory of<br>
"complex functionally-defined systems". (So would I!)<br>
Perhaps the first step in making such a theory would be<br>
to identify all the possible elementary functions, and <br>
"rules of combination" - ie ways in which elementary functional<br>
systems can be combined to make more complex ones.<br>
<p>
The theory of computation offers some precedent for this<br>
sort of theory, but it ignores functions which have some<br>
physical component (e.g. "energy production"). I also think<br>
that existing computational theory doesn't really address<br>
the semantic level very much. Someone called James Miller<br>
wrote a book, _Living systems_, advancing a "general<br>
theory of living systems" which claims that each living<br>
system must contain 19 (!) types of subsystems at least,<br>
or at least must have access to such subsystems (which <br>
might be located in another organism, or externally).<br>
I have a list of Miller's subsystem types at<br>
<a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/systems.html">http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/systems.html</a>. I don't<br>
recall anything in Miller's book which said that these<br>
are *all* the types of functional systems there can be.<br>
<p>
Identifying *all* the possibilities for elementary<br>
functional systems I think requires some metaphysical<br>
assumptions, about what sorts of relationships are<br>
possible. Maybe one could find prototypes for such<br>
arguments somewhere in the philosophical literature;<br>
I think Kant claimed that his enumeration of judgment-types<br>
(in _Critique of Pure Reason_) was necessarily complete <br>
(although I never found the actual argument demonstrating <br>
this).<br>
