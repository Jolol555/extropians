As you might expect, I would characterize the ultimate transhuman<br>
very differently:  someone too engrossed in the joy and challenge of<br>
becoming something new to be disturbed by others' opinions of what<br>
ey is now.  Such a transhuman, trapped and tortured, would be unlikely<br>
to find any offer made by such torturers the least bit tempting <br>
compared to eir vision of the future, and would find the concept of<br>
sacrifice void, or laughable, and in any case too insignificant to <br>
acknowledge, much less to refuse (my "ultimate transhuman" is much<br>
more into Yes than No).<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
