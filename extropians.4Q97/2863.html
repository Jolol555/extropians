A few thoughts for your comments.<br>
<p>
On the market, different agents bet that their own knowledge of the situation<br>
is better than their competitors'; the resulting price is a weighed average of the<br>
bids.  An efficient/rational system, by definition, is one that uses all its <br>
knowledge in an optimal way.  In this case, the optimal projection of the price<br>
would probably arise if all traders assembled and put their fragments of<br>
knowledge together (otherwise any dispute could be replaced by gambling).<br>
So the market cannot be rational?  Or maybe it can be fixed by the traders <br>
betting on some particular aspects of the market - the ones they actually<br>
claim to understand.  For example, instead of having meteorologists and trade<br>
analysts bet against each other based on their partial knowledge of the situation,<br>
meteorologists could put forward statements like "I bet that the floods will not<br>
destroy more than 5% of the crops this year", while the trade analysts will say<br>
something like "I bet that if the floods do not happen at all, the government will<br>
stockpile 10 million tons of the product".  Then, everybody would put their bets<br>
on what they know, without the risk of losing money from the reasons beyond<br>
their competence, and the resulting prediction would not only be more balanced,<br>
but will include a model of the expected market behavior.<br>
<p>
I wonder if something like this has been tried or researched.<br>
