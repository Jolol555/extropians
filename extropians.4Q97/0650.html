But still a monotonically rising function, does not go to infinity<br>
within a finite interval....Try a tangent instead...<br>

(sigh) Please read Nanosystems by Drexler. Please...<br>

<i>&gt; Im with you, but unknowable future beings are whats going to create our</i><br>
<i>&gt; future, so we are really limited if we dont make some predictions, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; extrapolations.  I think you would be interested in Terrence McKenna's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Timewave Theory, where he has a map of time and explains that all of history</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an ingression of exponential novelty towards a point, and that point has</i><br>
<i>&gt; repercussions back in time.  His proposed end date: dec 21, 2012.  That is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same end date as the Mayan calendar, and he says that he came to the end</i><br>
<i>&gt; date without the knowledge of the mayan end date, that must have been a shock</i><br>
<i>&gt; for hime to discover that Mayan information.  The Mayans were great</i><br>
<i>&gt; astromer/astrologers, who knew that the earth was round long before anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; else did, and lots of other stuff. Check out TM's homepage on the web:</i><br>
<i>&gt; deoxy.org/mckenna.htm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I happen to know the person who actually wrote the Timewave Zero<br>
software. The basis of this software came from interviewing Terence<br>
McKenna, who had a visionary set of experiences in the Amazon regarding<br>
hexagrams in the I Ching. It coincidentally fits with Arguelles' visions<br>
of the Mayan Calendar, but there is no direct connection. And! NOT<br>
EXTROPIAN THINKING! definitely not! I looked up the "Harmonic<br>
Convergence" (in 1987 if any of you remember). TW Zero came up with<br>
nothing, null, nil of interest for that day.<br>
<p>
Anyway, TWZero is an example of true psychoceramics and has no<br>
scientific basis at all...<br>

<i>&gt; All of matter is composed of one electron moving back and forth in time from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the beginning of time (big bang) to the end of time (2012 zero date). but im</i><br>
<i>&gt; not sure how he takes into account the positrons, perhaps they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; electrons moving back in time, or rather THE electron. I wonder what</i><br>
<i>&gt; determines where in the universe the electron manifests itself after each</i><br>
<i>&gt; round it makes.  Any thoughts? Also, are electrons the same as the subatomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; elements of neutrons and protons? If not, what are the similarities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences?</i><br>
<p>
Richard Feynman came up with it first, and uses the idea well, in what<br>
are known as "Feynman Diagrams". More reading to do....<br>
