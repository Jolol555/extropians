Just can't get away from that yin-yang, eh?  You're quite right,<br>
of course.  My friend Dale Carrico was also quick to point this<br>
out to me.  My experience has been (and I hope I don't offend anyone<br>
by saying this) that scientist-types tend to be more suspicious of<br>
expectation and its potential to foil perception (e.g., interpretation<br>
of the implications of an empirical experiment), whereas humanist-types<br>
tend to be more permissive of developing new expectations and<br>
allowing them to guide one's perceptions (e.g., a reinterpretation<br>
of an important work of literature).<br>
<p>
One of the things I like about the phrase "expectation foils<br>
perception" is that having this expectation about things for a<br>
while eventually enables one to see that expectation also enables<br>
perception.  And after rounding this particular epistemological<br>
loop enough times, some find it easier to deploy their filters<br>
deliberately, rather than themselves being deployed by their<br>
built-in filter-reflexes.<br>
