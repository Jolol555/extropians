When you say 'appeared to hit ground', did you actually see it hit, or did<br>
it go behind a hill?  <br>
<p>
I haven't heard anything about this event, but from your description, what<br>
you saw was an object weighing at least tens of kilograms falling from<br>
space.  Such objects are usually satellites or other space junk, but<br>
occaisionally natural meteorites.  It was unlikely to be a piece of Mir,<br>
since Mir is in a high orbit and is fairly disciplined about sending its<br>
junk back to Earth on spacecraft, rather than simply throwing it away.<br>
Most satellites are of sufficiently flimsy construction that they burn up<br>
before hitting the ground.  Re-entry would burn off at least an inch or two<br>
of solid steel, and few spacecraft parts are so hefty.  When Skylab<br>
re-entered, the only part that survived was a radiation-proof safe they<br>
kept their film in.  In particular, fuel cells are not dense enough to<br>
survive, AFAIK.  On the other hand, it probably was a Soviet or Russian<br>
object.  They sent up a lot more stuff than the rest of the world put<br>
together, and they weren't as fastidious as other countries about not<br>
letting things fall out of orbit.<br>
<p>
They're dropping things on your head because the odds of actually hitting<br>
anyone are pretty slim, and even if they hit someone, the chance of being<br>
held legally responsible is small, and even then, the cost of losing a<br>
wrongful death suit are far less than the cost of launching the payload in<br>
the first place.  <br>
