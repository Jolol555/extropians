There is an interesting serialized essay, "Volitional Synapses" by <br>
Stephen Boydstun in volume 2 issues 1, 2 and 4 of _Objectivity_ that <br>
covers some of these notions.  See<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/">http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/</a><br>
<p>
for details.<br>

I tend to agree with Damien (love that name!:).  I would also say, even<br>
without the neuroscience perspective, it is possible to integrate the<br>
inner (phenomenological) and outer (causal) views of mind.  The<br>
probably has been that philosophies of mind usually approach these<br>
either by dualism or monism.  Either they radically separate the two<br>
realms -- as if they are metaphysically distinct -- or they completely<br>
reduce one to an epiphenomenon of the other (e.g., Berkeley's<br>
idealism or Marxist materialism).  But I'd rather not go into a lot of<br>
detail on this.  My desire is to achieve technotranscendence (then<br>
take it for granted:) -- not endlessly discuss it.:)<br>
