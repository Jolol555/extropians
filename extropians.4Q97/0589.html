Greetings!<br>
<p>
Once upon a time, oh say back in 92, 93, I participated occasionally on<br>
this list. Many of the "old-timers" know me as I have attended west<br>
coast extropian parties, extro 2, participated in a cryonic suspension<br>
and promoted one particular extropian meme - wearable computers.<br>
<p>
Now, I find myself in the Boston area, after attending the International<br>
Symposium on Wearable Computing held at MIT over the last three days.<br>
Yesterday, during the questions part of  a session moderated by Marvin<br>
Minsky, with a panel of science fiction authors (Gregory Benford, Vernor<br>
Vinge, and Frederick Pohl!), I thought I heard the melifluous tones of<br>
Sasha asking a typically intelligent Sashaesque question. I couldn't see<br>
him to well from where I was seated, but later on at the wearable<br>
computer fashion show, I bumped into him, sure enough.<br>
<p>
Now, I know it is very late notice, but I am staying in the Boston area<br>
till sometime Saturday evening, and would like to get together with any<br>
extro types I can, pretty much any time, anywhere, between now and my<br>
departure. I had to conserve financial resources and relocate from the<br>
Cambridge Marriot. I am staying at the Boston Motel in Weymouth<br>
617.337.5200, rm. 42. I'll be up late tonight, though probably on the<br>
net, but you can feel free to attempt to call me up to 2am. Or email me.<br>
I have with me some interesting artifacts from the history of wearable<br>
computing as well as my current rig, and I'm incredibly fun to be with,<br>
unless I'm wrong about that.<br>
<p>
In other news, if you would like to see some pictures from the wearable<br>
computer conference, you can find them at my website.<br>
<p>
It was great fun meeting and speaking with Vernor Vinge, Gregory Benford<br>
and Thomas Bass (author of Eudaemonic Pie and reporter for Wired). I had<br>
hoped to get Vinge's autograph on True Names, but alas I didn't get the<br>
chance. But Marvin Minsky had written the afterword to the first<br>
edition, so I got his autograph, and more importantly, some of his DNA.<br>
I doubt my protocol was very good; I had him rub his finger on his head<br>
and place it on a piece of sticky velcro which I then stuck to the<br>
inside back cover of the book. I didn't have any Benford books, but I<br>
got his DNA and sig on the back of True Names as well. This was a first<br>
for each of these guys. I also have Eric Raymonds's DNA (hopefully) on a<br>
signed copy of The Hacker's Dictionary. BTW, Benford will be<br>
re-releasing Chiller (an excellent cryo-thriller) under his own name<br>
shortly.<br>
<p>
That's all for now.<br>
<p>
