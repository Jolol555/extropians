I'm not too sure about a closed universe being finite - or to be more<br>
specific existing in a finite space.  From my understanding, a way<br>
around the problem of there being boundaries to the closed universe is<br>
to say that "in a closed universe, space is infinite, but the matter<br>
within it only expands to a finite point".<br>
<p>
It makes a great deal of difference to cosmological models in my<br>
experience of them, but only on the grand scale of things, not re. local<br>
events.<br>
<p>
Not that this is the point of this thread :)<br>
