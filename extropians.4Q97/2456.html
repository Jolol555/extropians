Kathryn Aegis:<br>

<i>&gt; Not a parallel example, and not even quoted accurately.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Matthew 26:6:  a woman applies expensive oil onto Jesus's head during the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'last supper' and is criticized by the disciples, who say it should </i><br>
<i>&gt; have been sold for a great sum to buy food for the poor.  Jesus' reponse </i><br>
<i>&gt; is to the effect that a gift should be accepted graciously.</i><br>

It speaks more strongly to taking the "cause" so seriously that you lose all <br>
perspective. Everything must be for the cause, and far be it for simple human <br>
enjoyment to count for any such. That may not be what you intended, but that's <br>
how your post came across. As did Max's. I have this funny feeling that if<br>
it were something you "approved" of the reaction would have been much <br>
different. Neither post said outright "I disapprove". They rather tried a<br>
sidelong approach of questioning germaneness. Compared to some of the other <br>
posts on this list of late it had more to do with capitalism and the freedom<br>
to do what you want in the face of criticism. That's pretty libertarian<br>
in spirit, and it was interesting to see the reactions to it.<br>
As to the accuracy of the quote, my apologies. I was remembering it from long <br>
ago. I think, however that the insistence on accuracy has more to do with <br>
trying to discredit the poster rather than refuting the point made.<br>
I sense a lot of anger in your posts on this subject. I could largely care less<br>
about the gun debate, and was more reacting to Anton finding something he <br>
enjoyed and seeing someone trying to throw cold water on that enjoyment. <br>
Geez, lighten up.<br>
