<i>&gt; My problem with political theory and economic theory is</i><br>
<i>&gt; general, not directed toward any particular brand.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My problem is that these fields do not appear to be based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on any agreed-upon set of fundamental facts. They differ</i><br>
<i>&gt; from disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; geology, which each have an agreed-upon basis. Economics</i><br>
<i>&gt; and politics are in the same category of fuzzy science</i><br>
<i>&gt; with psychology and sociology.</i><br>
<p>
Well, of course it is!  That's precisely the reason it<br>
requires /more/ thought and discussion.  Natural philosophy<br>
(aka Physics) was once that way too, until Bacon and Newton<br>
and Galileo showed us better ways to think about it and<br>
test it.  But the other fileds of philosophy on the edge<br>
that don't yet have a solid method are that much more in need<br>
of critical thought, so we can develop those methods.  We<br>
must not shy away from the job merely because it is difficult;<br>
we must embrace it for precisely that reason.<br>
<p>
There are a few exact mathematical methods used in Economics<br>
and Politics; microeconomics, game theory, public choice theory,<br>
etc.  It is also true that there is a lot of Economics and<br>
Politics outside of those exact mathematical models.  But if we<br>
shied away from tackling the hard questions that don't yet have<br>
a scientific method, we never would have discovered science.<br>
And besides, who is to say that "agreed-upon" methods are any<br>
good in the first place?  Truth is not a matter of consensus.<br>
