<p>
Why wouldn't a posthuman be a saint ?<br>
<p>
I think (or maybe I hope it to much) that while the<br>
intellect is growing. the respect for every "life-form"<br>
is growing too. Would a posthuman really bother about<br>
trivial things as good and evil. Wouldn't he be more interested<br>
in just BE......Will he still strife for more matter/energy and<br>
get to it at all cost. I know I asked something similar already<br>
in this list. But I find it hard to grasp, that we will never become <br>
mature enough to deal with these instincts.<br>
What's the point........<br>
<p>
I hope there will be a time were the posthumans are so wise,<br>
they will say: why bother, let them have their playground.<br>
But since (hopefully) everybody is posthuman they will accept<br>
this limit, because there is no alternative. as is with life and<br>
dead. Dead is no alternative for anything, since your not<br>
aware of it anymore. If posthumans can foresee the dangers of<br>
wanting ever more mass/energy. They know they will destroy<br>
them selves. <br>
<p>
What did I miss......... ?<br>
<p>
Best regards,<br>
