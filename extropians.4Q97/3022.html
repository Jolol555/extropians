<p>
An American citizen may renounce his citizenship and remain in American<br>
territory.Much to the chagrin of the current pro-statehood Governor of Puerto<br>
Rico, some Puerto Ricans have officially renounced their American<br>
citizenship. Mr. Juan Mari-Bras, an attorney and veteran advocate of Puerto<br>
Rican independence, succeed in obtaining an Acknowledgment of Renounced<br>
Citizenship from the American Department of State plus a decision from the<br>
Puerto Rican Supreme Court decision granting him voting rights in island<br>
elections, despite the fact that the independentist leader is currently<br>
"stateless" (lacking the only official citizenship available to Puerto<br>
Ricans) in his own land. Since citizenship is a function of sovereignty, and<br>
Puerto Rico is not a sovereign polity, Mr. Mari-Bras's claim to "Puerto Rican<br>
citizenship" are more of an aspiration than a legal reality.<br>
<p>
The Jones Act of 1917 imposed/granted American citizenship to Puerto Ricans<br>
(just in time for World War I) and allowed Puerto Ricans of legal age who<br>
wished to reject such citizenship to do so at the time and remain "Puerto<br>
Rican citizens", a legal construct established in the 1898-1899 Treaty of<br>
Paris between Spain and the United States and confirmed in the Foraker Act of<br>
1900. Again, since Puerto Rico hasn't been a sovereign country since<br>
Spaniards settled and "pacified" the island in the early 1500's (with the<br>
exception of a brief autonomous regime in the first five months prior to the<br>
1898 American invasion), such citizenship is legally bogus.<br>
<p>
The funniest part is that, short of keeping a list of Renegades, there's no<br>
way an uninformed U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services agent would be<br>
able to keep Puerto Ricans "citizens" from re-entering American territory at<br>
any time, since all they need to produce is a birth certificate and voila!<br>
unarguable instant rights to re-enter the country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is statelessness merely a lack of any citizenship?  Or is it an officially</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognized status?</i><br>
<p>
Given the above cases, I'd say that statelessness might indeed be an<br>
officially recognized status within the United States.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are there (m)any legal or tax consequences of becoming stateless?</i><br>
<p>
The United States Internal Revenue Service (the dread IRS) will collect taxes<br>
even on Americans abroad and on any persons or legal entities generating<br>
income within this country, regardless of their immigration or naturalization<br>
status.<br>
<p>
I've heard that the IRS is the only tax collection agency in the world to<br>
pursue such a relentless policy.<br>
<p>
I trust this information is helpful.<br>
