Earlier this year I  read a very peculiar book by one David Morehouse, a<br>
former spookish `remote viewer', and concluded it was almost complete<br>
horseshit.  I hadn't then read Jim Schnabel's new book on remote viewing<br>
for purposes of calibration.  A copy recently came my way, courtesy of a US<br>
anomalies research journal which asked me for a review.  In the event (as<br>
you will see), my notice was insufficiently cool and scholarly, so the<br>
journal was obliged to decline it.  I thought I'd inflict it on you lot,<br>
since questions relating to mysticism and exotic science (or `science')<br>
crop up from time to time.  My own book on parapsychology research, and<br>
possible applications if psi turns out to be real, is THE LOTTO EFFECT:<br>
TOWARDS A TECHNOLOGY OF THE PARANORMAL (Melbourne, Australia: Hudson, 1992,<br>
ISBN: 0 949873 41 1). Herewith:<br>

For more than two decades, the US government ran several research programs<br>
into the military use of paranormal powers, or anomalous cognition.  This<br>
is not fiction, not *Dark Skies* or *The X–Files*.  The sponsors' chief<br>
goal was to implement `remote viewing' for intelligence gathering: use<br>
trained psychic skills to access places, events or persons distant in time<br>
and space.  Now they've stopped.  The money has dried up.  Or so they say.<br>
Other opinions abound.<br>
<p>
Professor Jessica Utts, a statistician at the University of California,<br>
Davis, and Professor Ray Hyman, a psychologist at the University of Oregon,<br>
were contracted several years ago by American Institutes for Research (AIR)<br>
to evaluate the program.  Under Pentagon pressure, the 23–year program was<br>
terminated late in 1995 (Schnabel, p. 386–7).  One might suppose that the<br>
evaluators had examined the best results from the various wings of the long<br>
project and found them wanting.  Not so, or not quite.  Curiously, Utts's<br>
report had concluded: `It is clear to this author that anomalous cognition<br>
is possible and has been demonstrated. This conclusion is not based on<br>
belief, but rather on commonly accepted scientific criteria.'  <br>
<p>
Hyman, a well–known sceptic, predictably disagreed, but admitted: `I tend<br>
to agree with Professor Utts that real effects are occurring in these<br>
experiments'.  Irritatingly, the assessors were not given the `operational'<br>
remote viewing material, just laboratory results from government–sponsored<br>
research done from the early 1970s at Stanford Research Institute and from<br>
1989 to 1994 at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).<br>
Most of the real material, according to Utts, is still classified (personal<br>
communication). <br>
<p>
Is the Truth, as Agent Mulder hopes, really Out There?  The subtitle of Jim<br>
Schnabel's thorough if journalistic account calls it `The Secret<br>
History...'  A little earlier, a very strange book by retired major David<br>
Morehouse, PhD, was subtitled `The True Story...'  Morehouse's remote<br>
viewing stint was with a Fort Meade, Maryland, army unit   although he<br>
suggests that the CIA's once–secret STAR GATE later assimilated the Army's<br>
SUN STREAK, meanwhile running their own parallel project.  Ingo Swann,<br>
arguably the *eminence grise* of the defunct official RV programs, is<br>
releasing chapters of his own history on the World Wide Web (after it was<br>
declined by America's `top five mainstream publishers' due, incredibly, to<br>
a perceived lack of public interest in the paranormal).  It provides a<br>
quirky if unfinished triangulation on the two books under review:<br>
<p>
`If nothing else,' Swann writes, `the American intelligence community is<br>
VERY mainstream.  The odds of a "psychic" (as I unfortunately was to be<br>
dubbed) of even entering into the realms of mainstream structured<br>
international espionage, much less surviving for some eighteen YEARS within<br>
the abundant machinations – well, such odds were nonexistent as of 1971'<br>
(chapter three, his uppercase).  Weirdly written in a voice that yokes *La<br>
Cage Aux Folles* to stilted  bureaucratese – the Vietnam War, he remarks,<br>
led to `the wide spread realization that the rationale for that war was<br>
nutso whacko' – this jumbled blend of immodest autobiography and strange<br>
history is unabashedly titled *Remote Viewing – The Real Story*.<br>
<p>
How `real’ and `true’ we should deem versions of that `secret ‘story is<br>
perhaps up to each reader, and opinions will vary considerably.  Schnabel's<br>
account seems to me believable.  Perhaps it's because he stands carefully<br>
back from the fray, despite having learned successfully How–2–RV from both<br>
Swann and former Fort Meade officer Ed Dames.  As with his previous<br>
splendid books *Round in Circles* (on the cereal–circle hoaxes, and lunatic<br>
mythologies that grew up around them) and *Dark White* (an hilarious,<br>
definitive study of UFO `abductions'), he allows the deluded, hallucinated,<br>
crackpated, prankish and felonious to reveal themselves, while playing fair<br>
with genuine intimations of mystery.  If Morehouse were to be believed, by<br>
contrast, it is a matter of plain (if, perhaps, still–classified) record<br>
that Defense Intelligence Agency personnel performed psychic overhead<br>
flights of the Gulf War, spoke to the dead, surveyed UFOs buzzing crop<br>
circles and under the sands of Mars, and locked on to the hidden Ark of the<br>
Covenant.  Just as well the major was out–of–body in that last-mentioned<br>
sacred place, for otherwise he'd have `perish[ed] instantly... vaporized'<br>
(Morehouse, 132).  <br>
<p>
Desert Storm's oil–well fires, it turns out, were a cover–up for US<br>
chemical weapons tests on its own soldiers.  Dave, out of body, saw the<br>
open canisters (169).  That's why the Army hounded him into court (and let<br>
him go, after he ended in the Walter Reed psychiatric ward, with an `other<br>
than honorable' discharge).  Earlier, they'd tried to kill him and his<br>
family.  Or maybe not.  As Morehouse admits, his book is heavily<br>
fictionalised, appropriating the experiences of others (some of them given<br>
proper or at least different attribution in Schnable).  It's under lavish<br>
contract for the movies, perhaps to star Stallone.<br>
<p>
So did the US program really develop effective methods for getting `into<br>
the ether' (lovely dumb 19th century term!), whizzing back and forth in<br>
space and time, contacting those toiling in the afterlife, angels,<br>
extraterrestrials in UFOs and on distant worlds?  If even the least of<br>
Morehouse's assertions were correct – and Schnabel corroborates the least<br>
lurid of them – if his unit's methodology for psychic espionage actually<br>
did work (bolstered by data from regular spies), it's hard to see why<br>
university parapsychologists at Edinburgh and Princeton and elsewhere are<br>
still fiddling about with their penny ante lab experiments.<br>
<p>
Schnabel's 1995 British Channel Four special `The Real X–Files: America's<br>
Psychic Spies', lightly mapped his book's territory in a bizarre *Twin<br>
Peaks*–meets–*American Gothic* style.  Despite these gestures of postmodern<br>
mockery, he claimed to have learned effective remote–viewing from Swann.<br>
And while he is cautious and very fleeting in his book on the topic of<br>
Morehouse's alleged exploits, Schnabel gave free vent to his distaste in an<br>
article recently posted widely on the Internet:<br>
<p>
`To me, his story is not just about the depths to which one human can sink.<br>
 (Morehouse is, in the end, perhaps only a sleazier, crazier version of the<br>
old Sgt. Bilko character.)  Somehow his story also reflects the current<br>
state of things in America, a country that seems to be going insane...<br>
What else to call a people who feed hungrily, via *The X–Files* and other<br>
forms of that hugely popular genre, on paranoid conspiracy fantasies<br>
otherwise found only on psychiatric wards?'<br>
<p>
It's intriguing to compare Morehouse's own account of his life (tragically<br>
misused by evil manipulators, but saved from suicidal depression by eternal<br>
love for his angelic wife   plus some actual kitschy angels   and his<br>
patriotism and decency), and Schnabel's relentless savaging in that<br>
article, excluded mysteriously from his book: Morehouse the scummy<br>
womaniser, the guy with `a small home improvement business, House Tech,<br>
that he ran on the side.'<br>
<p>
Can this be the same Morehouse who rails against the shocking state of<br>
morale and morals in the spook bizz (the other sort of spooks, you<br>
understand)?  `And some of their private lives!  A few staff members hardly<br>
bothered to conceal extramarital affairs...  It was a real Peyton Place,<br>
and I hated it...  Let me top my description off with the colonel who sold<br>
Afghani rugs out of the trunk of his car in the parking lot' (Morehouse, 157).<br>
<p>
The major's alleged sexual improprieties, even his goldbricking while on<br>
the payroll of the Defense Intelligence Agency, are finally irrelevant.  We<br>
all have our little quirks.  It's notable, though, that none of this<br>
material is touched in his book, either, not even to rebut it.  The jacket<br>
mentions his PhD (in Education Administration, I learned).  `My doctorate<br>
is from LeSalle University in Mandeville, LA.,' he told me by email.  He<br>
meant La Salle.  In a rather odd disclaimer, he added: `I did not simply<br>
buy my degree – believe it or not, I had to work for it' (personal email<br>
communication).  <br>
<p>
It'd be easiest, obviously, to discount Morehouse as a former, or feigned,<br>
psychotic with schmaltzy style and delusions of grandeur.  But we are meant<br>
to accept that this kind of operative provided the psychic material that<br>
the CIA and DIA and other dark powers once found impressive.  It stinks of<br>
a disinformation package to me, rich in odours attractive to New Age<br>
nostrils and *X–Files* fans and just as certain to wrinkle the snooty noses<br>
of sceptics.  Schnabel's *Remote Viewers* is a fine counter to Morehouse's<br>
vulgar concoctions.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, former military remote viewers such as Lyn Buchanan, Ed Dames<br>
and Joe McMoneagle, some selling ambitious coaching and psi–for–hire<br>
programs, are represented on the Net – Dames by Psi–Tech, Buchanan by<br>
P&gt;S&gt;I&gt;.  The latest excited news from Buchanan's site is that, perhaps due<br>
to the benign influence of morphic resonance, remote viewing skills can<br>
currently be learned with astonishing rapidity.  In just a few concentrated<br>
days or weeks, for a hefty fee, students can master powers over time and<br>
space that used to take months under Swann's structured protocol (*CRV:<br>
Recent Developments in Remote Viewing training*, on the P&gt;S&gt;I&gt; website).<br>
<p>
Swann's way was a sequence of neologised Stages: One, minimal sketched<br>
`ideograms'; Two, basic sense perceptions and emotional impacts,<br>
progressing through `dimensionals' to Three, large autonomous sketches;<br>
Four, listing of `tangible' and `intangible' quantities; Five, prompting<br>
for detail from specific target objects; Six, building a solid model in<br>
clay, like the UFO–obsessed seers in *Close Encounters* or perhaps, to be<br>
fair, like an architect externalising her blueprint; Seven, uttering<br>
free–floating phonemes in order to elicit meaningful cues and clues; and so<br>
on (Schnabel, 242–252).<br>
<p>
By his own account (although one might ponder as to its exact truth), Swann<br>
is a prodigy who had read the entire 30 volume *Encyclopaedia Britannica*<br>
before he entered kindergarten, and flow–charted the *Tao–te Ching* when he<br>
was seven (*Real Story*).  No less polymathic was the scientific mind<br>
behind Stanford Research Institute's psi program, Dr Hal Puthoff, who in<br>
1985 would walk away from SRI to research a fabulous alternative paradigm<br>
in deep physics, `zero–point' or `vacuum' energy (Schnabel 323), a quantum<br>
alternative to general relativity.  Did Puthoff use his disintegrating RV<br>
team's somewhat unreliable powers of precognition to select this risky<br>
venture?  Schnabel does not say, and neither does Puthoff.  It is<br>
intriguing, though, that Puthoff did employ `associational remote viewing'<br>
– a method of coding future market movements to binary targets, and earned<br>
$25,000 in a month for a community school (322).  <br>
<p>
Of course, one's lingering doubt as to the true efficacy of the RV method<br>
might fix itself to this kind of success story.  If Puthoff and his team of<br>
charitable RVers could precognise the stockmarket, and if, in a famous<br>
earlier debacle, silver futures had been traded with some success (265,<br>
322), why, then, are we still arguing over the merits of the method?  <br>
<p>
Schnabel lists numerous eye-openers, some familiar from Russel Targ and Hal<br>
Puthoff's *Mind-Reach* (1977), others fresh.  What must CIA anaysts have<br>
made of the detailed drawings Pat Price provided SRI of a secret Soviet R&amp;D<br>
target south of Semipalatinsk?  Here is the unusual, rail-tracked,<br>
eight-wheeled crane, the metal spheres being welded together, confirmed<br>
later by spy satellites.<br>
<p>
If government drug busters and armed forces and CIA and DIA and NSA and who<br>
knows what covert agencies attained some measure of astonishing accuracy in<br>
RV tasks – as Schnabel and Morehouse and McMoneagle and Swann and Buchanan<br>
assure us that they did – why were these programs allowed to whimper away?<br>
Why were they closed down as their early champions fell from grace or<br>
retired – men so well–placed as General Bert Stubblebine, chief of the<br>
Army's Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), General Ed Thompson,<br>
Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, and Jack Vorona, head of<br>
the DIA's Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate?  Is it enough<br>
to blame the resistance of stolid scientific paradigms, the contamination<br>
of lunatic cultisms, or the ebb and flow of social currents like the<br>
complex blend that saw nuclear power lauded one decade and despised the next?<br>
<p>
In any event, at least one former member of the remote viewing unit, an<br>
INSCOM officer, has vouched for Schnabel's account: `It appears to be very<br>
accurate....  While I do think Joe McMoneagle wrote a good RV book [*Mind<br>
Trek*, 1993], he was restricted in what he could say at that time.<br>
Schnable has certainly done his homework.'   But can such allegedly<br>
classified details truly be reliable?  I asked Lyn Buchanan, and he kindly<br>
provided this comment:<br>
<p>
` Jim Schnabel's book is probably the only one available to the public<br>
which sticks closely to the truth and real history of the unit.  There is a<br>
lot which is totally in error - in spite of the fact that it was<br>
information he should have had an easy time uncovering, and a lot which is<br>
surprisingly<br>
correct, in spite of being information he shouldn't have been able to get.<br>
It seems that he got many of the easy facts wrong, and really aced the<br>
stuff that should have been highly classified.  At any rate, it still<br>
sticks most closely to the truth and real history.  In summary, it isn't a<br>
totally accurate account, but it's the best available at the moment.<br>
Anyone wanting to know about the unit would be best to start here’<br>
(personal communication, 4 November, 1997).<br>
<p>
Clearly the same cannot be said of Morehouse's souffle.  In any event, to<br>
me, as an open–minded sceptical outsider agog at the reported accuracy of<br>
the best cases Schnable cites, the obvious gnawing question remains.  If<br>
this methodology works perhaps 50 percent of the time, especially when<br>
bolstered by signal–enhancing measures such as redundancy (tasking several<br>
viewers without their knowledge at the same target), how could such power<br>
be left to slip away?  <br>
<p>
`Even if a remote viewing of a specific target proved to have been accurate<br>
and useful,' Schnabel concludes, `its user, afraid of the giggle factor,<br>
could almost never acknowledge the fact' (338).  Prejudice and paradigms,<br>
the usual suspects.  I can't buy it.  If D. D. Home returned and flew<br>
through the air in front of video cameras, wired to the eyeballs with slick<br>
neuroscience electronics, I suspect he'd be whisked away promptly to a<br>
military lab, giggle factor or not.  <br>
<p>
If Mel Riley and Tom Nance and the rest really did pluck data from the<br>
vasty deep, how could any paradigm resist?  I disbelieve in iridology and<br>
homeopathy in part because my instinct tells me that if these laughable<br>
ideas endured the sieve of scientific testing, they would be by now the<br>
proprietory lines of Swiss billionaires.  Same with remote viewing.  I'm<br>
not so much dismayed by the coarse hallucinated mythos its shamanic<br>
practitioners seem to generate as they `bounce off the walls' (Schnabel<br>
73ff) – the pregnant Martian females under the New Mexico desert (377), the<br>
visions of the Ark of the Covernant – as flummoxed by their failure to have<br>
bought out Bill Gates by now.  Like Agent Mulder, I'd be quite happy to<br>
believe, but the state of the world hints it isn't so. <br>
<p>
But Schnabel's charming history makes it very tempting to relax my guard.<br>
