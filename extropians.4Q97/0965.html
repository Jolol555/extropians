Very good. Let's see, that means we have Aleph (transhumanism in <br>
Sweden), Excedo (tranhumanism in the Netherlands), Bostropians <br>
(Boston region extropians) and the Extropy Institute (extropianism <br>
world-wide). Have I missed out something?<br>
<p>
This Sunday I am scheduled to meet up with David Pearce to make <br>
plans for a transhumanist association in Britain.<br>

<i>&gt; what the main difference is between Extropy and Transhumanism ?</i><br>
<p>
Roughly speaking, the difference is that extropianism includes the <br>
political doctrine that something like anarcho-capitalism is a good <br>
thing. Thus every extropian is a transhumanist, but not every <br>
transhumanist is an extropian.<br>
