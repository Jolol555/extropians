<i>&gt; It seems inconsistent that you would object to Big Brother controlling</i><br>

<i>&gt; family role model.  Do you really want someone else to define how a</i><br>
<i>&gt; family should live and then force that definition on you and your</i><br>
<i>&gt; family?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What if they decide that your gun ownership makes you too dangerous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduce?  What if they consider having guns around your kids to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; child abuse?  What if they decide that a gun owner is not a "positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; male role model".  I can easily see fanatics making all these decisions</i><br>
<i>&gt; in an attempt to reduce violence by following your very own rules stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; above.</i><br>

Its obvious I did not go far enough so that even the most dense<br>
subscriber could see satire when they saw it.<br>
