<i>&gt; &gt; I still see a difference between stopping and starting the *same* </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; program (which is held in memory until restart),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whoa.  You want the program to be HELD IN MEMORY?  What happens if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets swapped to disk?  Do you think silicon transistors are better at</i><br>
<i>&gt; retaining identity than the magnetic disk surface?</i><br>
<p>
Of course not.  The problem (for me) is the question of whether the <br>
pattern which is me (we agree there) is changed significantly during <br>
the process, EVEN IF only temporarily.  An identical pattern will end <br>
up being started again in a few minutes, but THIS one will be copied <br>
onto disk and then destroyed.  The difference is that the one held in <br>
memory is EXACTLY the same when restarted, while one that's been <br>
copied to disk is an identical simulacrum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose you were running as a program, on a time sharing system, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're cool about it.  "No problem," you say, "since I'm being held</i><br>
<i>&gt; in memory between run slices."  "Hate to tell you this," I say, "but</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually this OS swaps you to disk between runs.  You've been swapped</i><br>
<i>&gt; in and out a dozen times during the last three seconds."  What do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you say?  How do you react?  Do you believe that you've been constantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; dying?</i><br>
<p>
Several people will have died, but none of them is me.  I may even <br>
fail to be very mournful of those people, but I will certainly take <br>
steps (if possible) to put a stop to MY impending death.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; and starting </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *another* program while stopping the first permanently.  We often </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think of two copies of a program as being 'the same' when in fact </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they have features that differ (location, frex).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now suppose you're running on a network.  "No problem," you say, "since</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm 'the same' program each time because I have the same location."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Hate to tell you this," I say, "but that network is shared with a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundred other programs, and the set of processors you're running on</i><br>
<i>&gt; is constantly changing.  Sometimes you're using these processors here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes those over there, sometimes it even pulls in some units from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; loaner system at the local data bank.  Your location has shifted 100</i><br>
<i>&gt; times since we've been talking."  What do you say?  How do you react?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you consider that you've been constantly dying with each shift in</i><br>
<i>&gt; location?</i><br>
<p>
Same as above.  A person might be able to cope with this (certainly <br>
some of you would have no problem with it), but I think the only way <br>
that I could deal with it would be to give up caring about my <br>
personal survival altogether.  That is, by making the same shift in <br>
priorities that almost everyone eventually does, caring more about <br>
the continuing existance of their children, their works of art, or <br>
ideas, than about identity survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would say that such a person has participated only once. :)  The </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fact that he has memories which are taken from previous people </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't mean that he *is* those people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, yes, one of the ground rules is that we're avoiding saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt; A *is* B.  All I meant was that he has memories of having gone through</i><br>
<i>&gt; this experience multiple times.</i><br>
<p>
Let me make myself more clear. Assume for a moment that we become <br>
able to transfer memories from person to person, but not whole <br>
personalities (yet).  Say someone, is implanted with the memories of <br>
ten or twelve skydivers who were all killed when their chutes failed <br>
to open.  Should he assume, then, that he is immune to sudden high- <br>
speed contact with the ground?  It matters very much whether we <br>
assume he is or is not the same person as the ones who fell.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Assuming that someone who may exist in the future will think that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they are me doesn't really help me accept the idea that *I* should be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; killed after the copy is made. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose you knew someone who was afraid to fall asleep, because he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced that every time he fell asleep he died, and a new version of</i><br>
<i>&gt; him awoke in the morning - someone who had all the same memories, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; a new person nonetheless.  How would you try to persuade him that he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; mistaken?</i><br>
<p>
I do know someone (or used to) like that.  Me.  When I first was <br>
convinced that the pattern of my brain was me, this bothered me quite <br>
a bit.  How large a change is necessary to produce a new person?  I <br>
have never found an answer to that, and finally lack of sleep led me <br>
to put it out of my mind. :)  <br>
