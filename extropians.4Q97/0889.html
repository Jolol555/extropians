&lt;excerpt&gt;Oooh!  Can I just point out that while I generally loved this<br>
movie,<br>
<p>
ALL 5 PEOPLE i went to see it with, as well as all three critics<br>
<p>
I've read review it, were happy to note that they felt the message<br>
<p>
of the film was an affirmation of faith [without evidence]!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I'd like to add my two cents..<br>
<p>
<p>
I'll just cut to the point, this movie was a smart way to introduce a<br>
somewhat sophisticated topic to middle america bible-belt types, as<br>
well as those too closed minded and programmed by a synical,<br>
controlling media machine. I can only hope in the not-to-distant-future<br>
someone writes a well written and SERIOUS film which deals with<br>
ubiquitous life in the universe. I've had enough ET's and Alfs.. lets<br>
see a first colony to Mars movie.<br>
