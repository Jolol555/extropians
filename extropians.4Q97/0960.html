Nobody can do that. Technologies, the ecological system etc. are highly<br>
nonlinear, and is is usually impossible to make accurate predictions over<br>
a long period ("sensitive dependence on initial conditions ..."). Kelly<br>
in "Out Of Control" suggests that the only way to learn something about<br>
such systems is to let them evolve, i.e., TIME is an important parameter, <br>
and there may be no shortcuts to a later state of the system. As for the<br>
consequences, Lem says in SUMMA TECHNOLOGIAE: "The only way to deal with<br>
a technology is another technology." (I'm currently re-reading it since <br>
it seems to contain some ideas which are valuable to extropianism; I've<br>
tried my best to translate the first chapter into English, since there<br>
doesn't seem to be an English edition, see<br>
<a href="http://itp1.physik.tu-berlin.de/~prengel/Lem/summa.html">http://itp1.physik.tu-berlin.de/~prengel/Lem/summa.html</a>).<br>

<p>

<i>&gt; improve the chance of not doing anything that has extremely bad results</i><br>

<p>
Come on. Do you really believe that nuclear technology (and weapons)<br>
wouldn't exist today if Einstein had decided not to publish "his" <br>
famous "E=mc^2"? At a certain point, discoveries simply are on the <br>
agenda, and it's a matter of chance WHO will be the lucky(?) one to <br>
make them, but they will be made sooner or later.<br>
