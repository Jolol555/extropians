Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.<br>
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending<br>
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for<br>
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying<br>
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.<br>
<p>
If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or<br>
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not<br>
buy from you.<br>
<p>
If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, <br>
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list <br>
just empty.<br>
<p>
	----------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received<br>
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.<br>
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,<br>
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and<br>
ask him/her to investigate this matter.<br>
<p>
Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to<br>
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.<br>
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is<br>
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be<br>
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way<br>
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the<br>
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If<br>
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when<br>
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope<br>
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was<br>
using your sendmail at this moment of time.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
