This is, of course, nonsense; the Nazis could have done just about as<br>
well with crossbows and swords if guns didn't exist. I'm also under the<br>
impression that most of those murdered in Rwanda were killed with machetes<br>
or blunt objects, and the Old Testament records plenty of examples of<br>
peoples wiped out with similar weapons.<br>

There is nothing wrong with guns, end of story. There are some things<br>
wrong with the way people use objects to maim and murder. An old <br>
acquaintance once claimed that he'd worked out twenty-three ways to <br>
kill someone with a teapot; does that mean there's something wrong <br>
with teapots? Or with murderers?<br>
