I'd have to say that your assumptions about this technology are as<br>
insightful as the automotive industry's opinion about combustion based<br>
propulsion. What we know about genetics could fill a thimble.<br>
<p>
Someday, these conversations will be compared to debates about the how flat<br>
the earth is. (-;<br>

<i>&gt;picture of healthy and muscular bodies growing suspended in fluid, ready</i><br>
<i>&gt;for cropping and transplantation, is entirely unhooked from everything we</i><br>
<i>&gt;know about mammalian developmental processes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, the real kicker in the headless frog embryo story is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;informed suggestion that we are nearing the point where functioning organs</i><br>

<i>&gt;them.  I don't see why this should be done drastically faster in vitro than</i><br>
<i>&gt;a body does it in vivo, but maybe there are ways to tweak the cycle if a</i><br>
<i>&gt;complete body isn't needed.  Other mammals grow big and strong far faster</i><br>

<i>&gt;preparations.</i><br>
