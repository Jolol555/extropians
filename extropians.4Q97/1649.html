I agree, those attachments are irritating, so exasperating in fact that <br>
lately I've been erasing Mr. Genen's posts before reading them. Equally <br>
obtuse, and this is not aimed only at Mr. Genen, are those in the habit of <br>
including 3 pages of unattributed quotes and quotes of quotes and quotes of <br>
quotes of quotes, and then adding only one small original line of their own <br>
at the end.  This sets off my delete finger real quick. The recursive hell of <br>
it all is that then some fellow decides to comment on that one rare line but <br>
for some mysterious reason doesn't include just that part but insists on <br>
quoting the entire chaotic mishmash of a post and the iteration continues and <br>
grows like a cancer. Sometimes technology can make things too easy, if all <br>
quotations had to be typed in manually I have a hunch their  use would drop <br>
rather dramatically.<br>

PS: My complaints are probably pointless because I doubt I'll change     <br>
    anybody's behavior, so feel free to rebut by calling this post as    <br>
    big a waste of bandwidth as those I grumble about, but please, don't <br>
    include every line of it when you do.<br>
