I agree.  I tried to argue the point but failed to persuade.<br>
<p>
BTW, an uplifting classic long predating David Brin is Olaf Stapeldon's<br>
_Sirius_.<br>
It is not good writing, but he takes the ideas very far.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your</i><br>

<i>&gt;in many ways than intelligent animals; you other two arguments are</i><br>

<i>&gt;of labor.</i><br>
<p>
One needn't uplift to the point of giving rights.  That is another issue<br>
altogether.<br>
However, my point was I think an intelligent guard dog might be able to carry<br>
out many other functions too.  It might be able to operate cameras and other<br>
surveillance equipment and summon (bark, set off alarms, talk?) humans, etc.<br>
through use of judgment rather than merely out of habit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then there is the technical aspect of uplifting: how do we do it? I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been thinking about the cruicial role of language in</i><br>
<i>&gt;bootstrapping intelligence; maybe the addition of a more advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt;language system to an uplift species would be a good start?</i><br>
<p>
It mgiht be, though my first step would be anything to increase brain power in<br>
a meaningful way -- whether than be increasing speed or firing, changes in<br>
connections or adding more neurons/connections.  Of course, this is just a<br>
guess.  Intelligence might have little to do with these things -- which I<br>
seriously<br>
doubt; I think brain structure/operation has almost everything to do with it:)<br>
-- but if we start experimenting, we'll soon find out.  How can this be done?<br>
Surgery is one route, though I'd be more into breeding and controlling<br>
development hormonally and genetically.  Increasing the amount of effort<br>
and time to growing a larger brain in, say, octopi, might be a good start.<br>
Cheap too?<br>
<p>
I also believe intelligence to be best measured by problem solving abilities.<br>
Language would be a good way but not the only way to implement this<br>
measurement.  (There are nonlinguistic tests we can do to test uplifted<br>
organisms, such as some which are already done with mice.:)<br>
<p>
Play God!<br>
