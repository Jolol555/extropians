I'm not much of an investor, but my sense is that this correction will<br>
go on for many months.  The market has been quite high by historical<br>
standards.  The high valuation can really only be sustained by a bullish<br>
investor psychology, where people are buying in expectation of rapid<br>
price increases rather than for future value.  Even though the proximate<br>
cause of the drop is Asian financial instability, the real reason is<br>
this change in psychology.  Everyone's been nervously waiting for the<br>
market to peak, and when they see it, they want to get out.<br>
<p>
This price shock will probably change the average motivation from greed<br>
to fear.  If the market doesn't bounce back fairly quickly, investors<br>
will realize that it is no longer a sure thing, and they will want to<br>
protect the profits they have made so far.  They will do so by selling,<br>
which will further drive down prices.<br>
<p>
One interesting difference from the 1987 crash is the use of trading<br>
halts.  This was a controversial measure put into place after that crash.<br>
The idea is that the crash is motivated by irrational panic, and that by<br>
halting trading for a while, reason will return.  It's an unusual theory<br>
because it is based on the assumption that investors are irrational,<br>
which is contrary to the assumptions generally used in analyzing markets.<br>
<p>
A lot of people opposed these holds because they depart from the idea of<br>
a free and efficient market, and they seem like attempts to legislate<br>
away the natural process of fluctuating prices.  But in the aftermath of<br>
the 87 crash people felt like they had to do something.<br>
<p>
Today, the market fell about 200 points, and so they put in a 30<br>
minute hold.  As soon as the hold was lifted it fell even faster.<br>
People said it almost seemed like the hold just gave people time to get<br>
more sell orders in.  Finally, the market was shut down 45 minutes early.<br>
Otherwise the drop, a record in terms of points lost in one day, would<br>
have been even worse.<br>
<p>
It could be that these holds and shutdowns may make the psychological<br>
factors even worse.  If the market is falling, at least you can assume<br>
that at any given moment the valuation approximately reflects people's<br>
views.  Actually, of course, during a rapid drop like today the market<br>
may lag behind, but generally at the end of the day you can expect that<br>
the next day could see some improvement.  But when you know that the only<br>
reason the market didn't fall more was because of an artificial hold,<br>
you can be practically certain that this will generate more pent-up<br>
selling pressure.  The holds end up increasing fear and uncertainty<br>
because you no longer can assume that the market is clearing and<br>
reflecting people's opinions.<br>
<p>
I don't think now is a good time to buy.  Although recent drops have<br>
been followed by quick recoveries, I don't think that will be the case<br>
this time.  It should be possible to get a much better deal in a few<br>
months, although by then the psychology will have turned so that no one<br>
will be very excited in stocks at that time (which is itself a time to<br>
start buying).<br>
