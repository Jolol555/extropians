<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps Brin's and my discomfort with cypherpunks is only that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but I think it is more: as I said, in my experience, those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attach great value to preventing the spread of information about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themselves I find strange.  It is not a reasoned judgment, only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an emotional reaction, but it is a prejudice that serves me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've thought a little bit about this (because at first I found it a </i><br>
<i>&gt; really weird statement). I myself always was very 'open' with </i><br>
<i>&gt; information about me, not really paying attention on who might read my </i><br>
<i>&gt; eMail, for an instance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, it turned out that the wrong people DID read SOME of my </i><br>
<i>&gt; private mail, and got a completely wrong impression. Now I have to say </i><br>
<i>&gt; that anybody who writes anything not adressed to a public (like in </i><br>
<i>&gt; mailing-lists) unencrypted is simply naive. The problem is not that much </i><br>
<i>&gt; revealing something about your personality, but people who only get parts </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the information and misunderstand it - without you having control over </i><br>
<i>&gt; that. The greatest 'threat' I see is simply being quoted out of context </i><br>
<i>&gt; by people with prejudices - and not even getting the opportunity of </i><br>
<i>&gt; straightening such things out.</i><br>
<p>
Everyone's impression of me is wrong anyway, and always will be.<br>
They make bad judgments even in the face of plain English in<br>
context, so of course they'll do even worse faced with forgeries<br>
or out of context quotes or misattributed statements.  That's life.<br>
The question then becomes "Why do you allow yourself to be bothered<br>
by other people's mistaken impressions?"<br>
<p>
And the set of "people with prejudices" is mathematically equal to<br>
the set of "people".  Prejudice is a universal, useful cognitive<br>
function; it is often mistaken, but that's the tradeoff--speed for<br>
accuracy.  Everyone makes those decisions as needed.<br>
<p>
I do try to correct impressions when I can, but if someone is<br>
content to think I'm an idiot or a jerk based on eir impressions,<br>
and doesn't want to hear me argue otherwise, that's eir right,<br>
and I just have to live with it.<br>
