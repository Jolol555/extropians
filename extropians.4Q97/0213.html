I think we have one already.  Do a bunch of things; see what happens;<br>
pick the thing that worked best; repeat.  It works for creating<br>
lifeforms, building immune systems, running anthills, and Hofstadter's<br>
creative thinking programs.  It explains a lot about how my mind works,<br>
I feel.  I've called intelligence "evolution uploaded" before, and I'll<br>
stand by that.  <br>
<p>
The tricks, of course, are in the representation of ideas and the<br>
selection process.  I'm not sure if those are part of the universal<br>
algorithm or part of the hardware.  If you call them hardware, though,<br>
then we do know the algorithm to produce superintelligence, because the<br>
algorithm of evolution will have produced us, our brains, and the ideas<br>
which designed the superintelligence.  You just need to run the program<br>
long enough on enough hardware with enough interaction with the external<br>
world.<br>
<p>
A dog won't discover to general relativity because its hardware is<br>
constrained.  Unlike Hal, I think a normal, or at least not very far<br>
above average, human might.  But I'm optimistic about human genetic<br>
potential and pessimistic about our education system.  I learned calculus<br>
in 8th grade; "gifted" 8th graders are lucky to take algebra.  Learning<br>
calculus then was fairly logical after learning algebra in 5th grade.<br>
How?  My parents fought for it.  Did anyone else get the chance to take<br>
algebra in 5th grade?  Nooo...<br>

Jeane L. Dixon, world renowned psychic, died Saturday (1/25) at age 79.<br>
There was almost universal sadness and lament throughout the world of<br>
celebrity psychics.  Contacted at her home, Dionne Warwick's spokeswoman<br>
said that "[Miss] Warwick is beside herself -- none of us expected this<br>
to happen."<br>
