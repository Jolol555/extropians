I'm afraid you're already a victim :) <br>
<p>
Here's something out of SKEPTIC vol.2 no.5 ... from an article titled "The Power<br>
 of the Meme Meme" by Susan Blackmore:<br>
<p>
        "Internet viruses are a relatively new arrival.  Last week I received a <br>
very kind warning from someone I've never met. 'Do not download any message <br>
entitled PENPAL GREETINGS' it said-- and went on to warn me that if I read this <br>
terrible message I would have let in a Trojan Horse virus that would destroy <br>
everything on my hard drive and then send itself on to every e-mail address in <br>
my mail box.  To protect all my friends, and the world-wide computer network, <br>
I had to act fast and send the warning on to them. <br>
        "Have you spotted the trick? The virus described does not make sense; in<br>
fact, it does not exist.  The real virus is the warning.  This is a clever <br>
little meme-complex that uses both threats and appeals to altruism to get you--<br>
the silly, caring victim-- to pass it on." <br>
