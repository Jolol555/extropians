I don't want to post a "me too" one, but this is the one I like best.<br>
For me this is what it's all about.<br>
<p>
I'm realistic: we build our own structure as you all heard by now,<br>
but this also costs money. I'm not complaining, it's my free choice.<br>
So I know very well what the dilemma of Max is. You want more people<br>
but you also need money. Charge them to high and they go, charge<br>
them to low and your own structure fails to exist.<br>
<p>
So, for me, It's not the price that bothers me. I will make my own<br>
decision if I think I have value for money.<br>
(although it's a bit "stupid" to pay one organization while you can<br>
use all the money for your own, since they both serve the "same"<br>
purpose)<br>
<p>
What bothers me is the<br>
fact that after all the hard work of Extropy, I'm not far off by saying<br>
that the Transhuman-meme isn't firmly known around the world.<br>
I (we) would like to focus on this meme-spreding thing first.<br>
More people = more idea's = more commitment = more donations<br>
= a stronger well known structure.<br>
Transhumansim is he very first "thing" in the world I'm more then <br>
willing to invest a lot off time and money in with whole my hart.<br>
After reading a lot<br>
on the site off Henry Kluytmans and Anders Sandberg.<br>
(they both try to educate people) I was hooked, I saw the light :-)<br>
I also thought (think) that seeing everything that was (is) going on<br>
here; all Transhumanists are honestly working/hoping for a better<br>
world with as much people on board as possible.<br>
So in my/our own humble way I/we will work <br>
(with all who would like to help)<br>
towards a well known Transhuman organization (in the Netherlands)<br>
<p>
I noticed the frustration about the Noise. Since I'm a newbie<br>
myself I take this partly personal. But I also noticed that<br>
sometimes one off my posts started some "high"-level off<br>
discussion on which (due to lack off scientific knowledge)<br>
I had to drop out. But let me tell you again: I learn and enjoy.<br>
But also, aren't this the sparks you need now and then, if<br>
you are highly educated and seen it all ?<br>
<p>
Anyway: I will see what Max decides, it's "his" organization<br>
and I'm thankful to him that I could be part off this list.<br>
But Max, I hope you agree with me that if you want to attract<br>
new people in large amounts you have to make sure that the<br>
hurdle they have to take is as low as possible.<br>
<p>
Best regards,<br>
<p>
