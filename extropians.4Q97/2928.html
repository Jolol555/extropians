And all along we thought you were talking about consumer side<br>
externalities. Please be clear. As for producer side externalities,<br>
beyond tort expenses that are a function of how ridiculously tortious a<br>
given jurisdiction, combined with device safety factors, there would be<br>
little in the way of external costs, unless you want to go into<br>
externalized energy production costs, mining costs, etc. which,  in the<br>
end ARE paid for by somebody, which eventually comes around to effect<br>
the market cost/value of a gun. Given that a gun bearing populace seems<br>
to effect a lower tax rate (comparing the datapoints of Europe, the US<br>
in general, and New Hampshire (the main production point of Sturm, Ruger<br>
&amp; Co., the only significant firearms manufacturer left with production<br>
facilities in the US)), gun production seems to have a synergistic<br>
effect on maintaining low labor and tax costs, a high quality of life<br>
and low cost of living for employees, and given decades of annual<br>
profits and rising stock prices, a positive return on investment.<br>
