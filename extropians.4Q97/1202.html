<p>
I'm no economist, but here is one way that war could seem to help.<br>
<p>
In an economy, there needs to be a balance between consumption and<br>
production.  A certain level of production can support a certain standard<br>
of living.<br>
<p>
In practice, it seems that often these factors are slightly mismatched,<br>
and lead to oscillations in consumption/production levels.  Consumption<br>
is a little too high (unsupportable standard of living), and then there<br>
is a recession and consumption is a little too low (too much forced<br>
saving).  This is a vastly oversimplified picture of the traditional<br>
business cycle.<br>
<p>
In a war, there is more forced saving.  People are called upon to<br>
sacrifice.  There may be propaganda or nationalistic sentiment which<br>
furthers these feelings.  People forego consumption which they would<br>
normally enjoy.  The excess is taxed away or donated to the war effort.<br>
<p>
This forced saving fuels gains in production which carry on even<br>
after the war is over.  The result is rapid post-war growth.<br>
<p>
Even though the growth is obvious, it is not necessarily worth the cost.<br>
During the war years, people are forced to make sacrifices which they<br>
would not have been willing to do voluntarily if there had been no war<br>
- rationing, taxation, possibly even forced labor.  Afterwards they<br>
enjoy the benefits of the savings.  But if the benefits were worth the<br>
sacrifice, they would have saved voluntarily in order to achieve future<br>
benefits.  Since they did not do so, presumably the payoff at the end<br>
is not worth the years of sacrifice.<br>
