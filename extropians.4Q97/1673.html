         <br>
      From "The Dictionary of Symbols: by J.E. Cirlot; RKP [1971]:<br>
<p>
ALCHEMIC: ... Sublimation, the sixth stage, symbolized the suffering <br>
resulting from the mystic detachment from the world, and the dedication to <br>
spiritual striving.  In emblematic designs, this stage is depicted by a <br>
wingless creature borne away by a winged being; or sometimes by the  <br>
Prometheus myth.<br>
<p>
<p>
FIRE:  Paracelsus demonstrated the parallel between fire and life, pointing <br>
out that both must feed upon other lives to keep alive.  To steal fire <br>
like Prometheus, or to give oneself up to fire, like Empedocles, are two <br>
concepts which point to the basic dualism of the human predicament.  The <br>
middle way lies in the comforthable solution of simply making material use <br>
of the benefits of fire.  But fire is  ultra-life.  It embraces both good <br>
(vital heat) and bad (destruction and conflagration).  It implies the <br>
desire to annihilate time and to bring all things to their end.  Fire is <br>
the archetypical image of phenomena in themselves.  To pass through fire <br>
is symbolic of transcending the human condition, in 'Myths, Dreams and <br>
Mysteries' (London, 1960).<br>
<p>
<p>
ZODIACAL: Piobb has linked the Trials of Hercules with the Zodiac ... The <br>
eagle is linked with Prometheus to Aquarius.<br>
<p>
<p>
RING: Like every closed circle, the Ring is a symbol of continuity and <br>
wholeness.  Thus, it is told that when Jupiter allowed Hercules to rescue <br>
Prometheus, it was on condition that the latter should wear an iron ring, <br>
set with a piece of rock from the Caucasus, as a symbol of submission to <br>
his punishment ... T the same time, the light radiated by the ring of <br>
flames symbolizes eternal wisdom and transendental illumination.<br>
<p>
<p>
VULCAN: Vulcan, as a symbol, is related to the smith who has his forge in <br>
the mountain-cave, and hence to the demiurge.  Indeed, the Ancients <br>
explained volvanoes by reference to underground forges and spernatural <br>
smiths...  Diel siggests that Vulcan, Icarus and Prometheus are symbolic <br>
of the intellect -- understood almost in its techical and 'merely human' <br>
sense -- in open rebellion against the spirit.<br>
<p>
<p>
MYTHOLOGY: "In the person of Prometheus in the 'Works and Days', if <br>
anywhere in Greek mythology, appears a figure beloved by anthropologists <br>
and others, the 'culture hero' wo, at the dawn of time won for man certain <br>
essential advantages of his civilized existence.  The Tiatan Prometheus <br>
angered Zeus with men by cheating him of his portion of animal-meat when <br>
sacrifice was instituted.  This provides the validating charter for the <br>
Greek sacrificial ritual, in which the bones and fat were offered to the <br>
Gods and the meat was kept for human consumption.  In retaliation, Zeus <br>
took fire from men.  Prometheus stole it back again.  <br>
<p>
<p>
      Zeus took his revenge by instructing Hephaistos, Craftsman of the <br>
Olympians, to fashion woman from clay.  Athena [Tony bows respectfully...] <br>
decked her out with fine clothes and flowers, but she was given a <br>
deceitful nature ...  These stories account for fire, sacrifice, human <br>
toil and sickness by providing an imaginatively and emotionally satisfying <br>
explanation for them, based upon the known world-order.  Explanation <br>
alleviates the hardship by making it comprehensible.  The story of woman <br>
as both a delight and a curse even hints at the kind of 'mediation of <br>
opposites' which, it it has been argued, is the universal function of <br>
mythopoeic activity.  Again, the stories are old -- much older than <br>
Hesiod."  -- J.P. Kane.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
PRACTICAL GREEK MAGIC: "The Titan Iapetus had four sons: Menoetius; Atlas; <br>
Prometheus; and Epimentheus...  Prometheus, whose main weapon seems to <br>
have been cunning, had a different fate, and played an important role in <br>
the legendary history an origins of humanity.; during the revolt of the <br>
Titans he kept a prudent neutrality and was actually admitted into the <br>
circle of the Immortals, but he entertained a silent grudge against the <br>
destryers of his race and constantly favoured men against the Gods.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Robert Graves postulates that tht Talmudic archangel Michael was the <br>
counterpart of Prometheus, no doubt on account of the similarity between <br>
the story of Prometheus' involvent in clay and water being used to fashion <br>
the first men in the likeness of gods into whome Athene breathed life; and <br>
the story of Jehovah acting in a similar fashion to create Adam and Eve.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The occult significance of the Promethean story is obvious;  it <br>
concerns the ever recurring theme of a group of people who possessed <br>
advanced knowledge of both science and magic which they gave to a race who <br>
were not spiritually or somatically evolved enough to make good use of it. <br>
 The Tree of Knowledge inevitably carries its sacrificed saviour, <br>
Prometheus joining the ranks of those wisdom gods who suffered for the <br>
redemption of mankind but also gained knowledge and furthered their own <br>
spiritual evolution as a result." -- Murry Hope [1985].<br>
