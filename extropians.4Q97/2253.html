I agree.  It's very interesting, I had not heard of this measurement<br>
before.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;or that the temperature hasn't risen in the past (though it's odd that </i><br>

<p>
It certainly does not!  0.04 degrees "per decade" measured over a lousy<br>
2 decades???  That's statistical fluctuation if I ever saw it.  It is<br>
*very* good that we are starting to measure temperature fluctuations<br>
rather than use computer-aided guessing, but at this point there is<br>
nowhere *near* enough evidence to make any sort of long-term predictions<br>
whatsoever.<br>
