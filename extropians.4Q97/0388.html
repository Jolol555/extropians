There appears to be an engineering problem with the design, namely the size.<br>
<p>
In an ideal rigid floating body, the net buoyancy of the object is uniform<br>
across the entirety of the bottom of the object.  In reality this is never<br>
the case.  The problem is that these variations in buoyancy generate<br>
stressful forces on the ship that grow geometrically as the length grows<br>
arithmetically.  At some point the stresses will tear the ship apart.<br>
<p>
Very large ships, such as supertankers ( which are much smaller than the<br>
"Freedom Ship" ), are very fragile and have to be loaded in a manner that<br>
distributes the mass evenly throughout the ship.  A momentary increase in<br>
mass in one part of the ship can cause the ship to rip itself in half.<br>
Sailing through rough seas with a less than optimally balanced load will do<br>
the same thing.<br>
<p>
According to the resume on the site, the guy who designed the "Freedom<br>
Ship" did not have the design of very large water-craft in his engineering<br>
expertise.  <br>
<p>
FTR, I am no expert on this type of engineering either, but I've had<br>
lengthy discussions in the past on this topic with a guy who is an expert,<br>
both as an engineer ( wrote design software for this type of thing ), and<br>
as a former supertanker captain.<br>
<p>
A more feasible design would be to either have a bunch of smaller floating<br>
objects connected non-rigidly, or to make the structure stacked *a lot*<br>
shorter (minimize vertical pressure) so that the superstructure will be<br>
capable of withstanding the buoyant forces.  A structure that is both long<br>
*and* tall simply won't work.  Either way, it will be a serious compromise<br>
to his "ideal" design.<br>
