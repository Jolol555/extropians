<i>	&gt;Exactly, and that's why I specified "the" objective definition         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;rather than "an" objective definition. There are many objective         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;definitions of reality, but only one of them is right. </i><br>
			   <br>
<p>
So, on the basis of your objective definition you're able to put labels on <br>
all events, a tag consisting of the squiggles "good" or "evil" and presumably <br>
a number indicating the magnitude of each, but how could I find a direction <br>
to this axis?  Why should I do good and avoid evil rather than the reverse? <br>
Or for that matter, why not do things on a line perpendicular to your axis, <br>
or a line that intersects it by 32.587 degrees?  You were speaking of complex  <br>
numbers, perhaps we need them to specify an event in moral space, next time  <br>
my dog eats my newspaper perhaps I should scold him by saying <br>
"you're a 17 + 28i dog".<br>
<p>
I say this because in your Oct 7 post you as much as admitted that your <br>
choice of a moral axes would always be arbitrary, you said:<br>
<p>
 "objective morality wouldn't be a force pervading the Universe for Good,   <br>
  just an objective method of labeling events "good" or "evil"."  <br>
			   <br>
<p>
<i>	 &gt;You're saying that the existence of numbers causes there to be more         </i><br>
<i>	 &gt;objects?  Objective cardinality is a force pervading the Universe         </i><br>
<i>	 &gt;which causes all numbers to increase?</i><br>
			   <br>
<p>
I said nothing about anything causing anything and I said nothing about <br>
numbers increasing. I did say that if there was a hypothetical universe in <br>
which the idea of number did not exist because it was somehow contradictory, <br>
then saying there were many things in that universe would be gibberish. <br>
I also remind you that you're the one who proposed such a example not me, <br>
so don't blame me if it's bizarre.<br>
			   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Nice bait-and-switch, but you should know better than to try changing        </i><br>
<i>	&gt;definitions on me. Just because "Objective Reality" isn't defined as         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;what you believe, doesn't mean that what you believe isn't a *part*,         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;a *subset* of Objective Reality. </i><br>
			   <br>
<p>
Fine, but that's not what you said, you talked about objective reality being  <br>
defined in such a way that it was not the cause of the neural events in my  <br>
brain, and I said that in that case what you call "objective reality" did not  <br>
interest me.<br>
			   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;So I repeat:  If I define Objective Reality so that your neurons         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;don't define OR but are merely part of it, </i><br>
			   <br>
<p>
OK but that's no repeat, that's the first time you said it.<br>
			   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;does this mean OR has no interest to you?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, then it interests me because objective reality can change me and I can <br>
change it. Neither is true of "objective morality" and that's why it has  <br>
nothing to do with me. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;If I say that your goals don't define External morality but are         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;merely a part of it, does this mean EM has no interest to you?</i><br>
			   <br>
<p>
Yes, it still does not interest me. All you have said in the above is that <br>
sometimes I do good things and sometimes I don't and there are some good <br>
things as well as bad I never do. I'm sure that if you worked at it you could  <br>
dream up a definition of morality that fit the above specifications, but <br>
that's not nearly good enough. I want to know what's different about that <br>
definition rather than the infinite number of other possible ones, I want to  <br>
know why I should follow its dictates and not others.  <br>
<p>
Because only one objective morality is true.<br>
What do you mean by true?<br>
Only one you should follow.<br>
Why should I follow only one?<br>
Because only one is true. <br>
Why should I do what's true? <br>
Because it's good.<br>
Why should I do what's good?<br>
Because it's moral. <br>
Why should I do what's moral?<br>
Because it's true.<br>
