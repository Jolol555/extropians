I guess this is where our opinions diverge.  I don't want to consider the<br>
point of view of the person who walks away from the experiment.  I want to<br>
consider the point of view of the person who walks into the experiment.<br>
That's the only "me" that exists right now.  That's the "me" that I want to<br>
preserve.  I think that we are each contemplating different questions and<br>
may not be disagreeing on the exact same points.<br>
<p>
Question One, which I think is my concern:<br>
- Is the original body still "me"?<br>
- Does it stop being "me" for any reason?<br>
- What is the criteria for it to stop being "me"?<br>
- How does the copying operation meet these criteria?<br>
<p>
Question Two, which I think is your concern:<br>
- Is the new body "me"?<br>
- Does it start being "me" for any reason?<br>
- What is the criteria for it to start being "me"?<br>
- How does the copying operation meet these criteria?<br>
<p>
I am more concerned with the answer to the first question.  If the original<br>
person is still "me", then I don't want "me" killed.  I see no mechanism<br>
for its point-of-view of being "me" to be transferred to the new body.<br>
Piping the new body's perception back to the original to make me<br>
"experience" moving to the new body is backwards.  It takes independent<br>
experience from the new body and then later plays it back in the original.<br>
This implies that the new body is having experience independent from the<br>
original, that the new body's experiences are not enjoyed by the original,<br>
and that the original's experience must be suppressed and overridden.<br>
Implanting my memories to the new body makes it "remember" being "me", but<br>
it never really experienced the things that it "remembers."  We just as<br>
well could program it to remember UFO abductions and Satanic Ritual Abuse<br>
that never occurred.  If I could perceive my point-of-view through the new<br>
body, and have that point-of-view continue after the two are disconnected,<br>
then I would feel transferred.  If after the disconnection occurs, I<br>
suddenly find myself still in my original body, I would think the transfer<br>
had not occurred.  Until the original body stops perceiving itself as "me"<br>
from its point-of-view, I would still consider it to be "me".  Killing it<br>
to stop this perception is not an acceptable answer, because this death is<br>
the exact thing that I am trying to avoid with the copy.<br>
