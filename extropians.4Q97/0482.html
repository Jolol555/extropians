<i>&gt;</i><br>
I like your term "rational values."<br>
<p>
I think people need to do more than dump religious<br>
beliefs in order to arrive at rational values; they<br>
also need to dump certain political beliefs and<br>
illusions, such as Harry Browne's "government myths"<br>
('How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World') and your<br>
'Deep Anarchy' &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
People who dump religious beliefs won't kill "for God,"<br>
but while they retain certain political beliefs and<br>
illusions, they'll continue killing "for Country."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[Another way to put this, fanciful but helpful: If there really were</i><br>
<i>&gt;vampires, and there survival really did depend on drinking the blood of</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans (in such a way that it killed them and there were no alternatives</i><br>
<i>&gt;like blood banks) then it would be *right* for vampires to attack humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It would also be *right* for humans to defend themselves. Differences in</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature produce different behaviors that are good for the beings that do</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. Given that humans have essentially the same nature, such moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;divergence is unlikely. If our AI's emerge as radically different from us</i><br>
<i>&gt;in terms of basic motivations, then some of their rational morality may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite different from ours.]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The nature of an "is" implies certain "oughts" for<br>
that "is."  Abraham Maslow argued this quite well<br>
in 'The Farther Reaches of Human Nature.'  Seeking<br>
survival is part of the nature of certain entities.<br>
No special decision to survive is necessarily required<br>
for rational values to be derived.<br>
<p>
Entities of a common nature will also have certain<br>
rational values in common.  And, as you've argued,<br>
certain differences between entities will result in<br>
differences among some of their rational values.<br>
<p>
Harry Browne ('How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World')<br>
also advocates that all individuals need to consciously<br>
and deliberately derive their personal values.<br>
<p>
There is an important reason why people can argue<br>
endlessly about certain subjects, particularly if<br>
high-level abstractions like "morality" are involved.<br>
Most people naively believe that "words have meanings."<br>
It's more appropriate to think in terms of "people have<br>
meanings for words."<br>
<p>
In a similar way that we have commonalities and differences<br>
regarding rational values, we also have commonalities and<br>
differences in our meanings for words.<br>
<p>
The lower the level of abstraction of a word (i.e., the<br>
closer it is to physical reality), the greater are the<br>
commonalities in our meanings and the smaller our differences.<br>
<p>
The higher the level of abstraction of a word (i.e., the<br>
further it is from physical reality), the smaller are the<br>
commonalities in our meanings and the greater our differences.<br>
<p>
In the physical sciences, most terms are low-level abstractions,<br>
so there's widespread agreement on what we mean by them and<br>
how we use them.<br>
<p>
In the "humanities," by contrast, many terms like "morality"<br>
are high-level abstractions, so there's widespread disagreement<br>
on what we mean by them.  Furthermore, attempted "definitions"<br>
of high-level abstractions seldom resolve the disagreements.<br>
