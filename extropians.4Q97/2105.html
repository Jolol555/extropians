Max More suggests:<br>
<i>&gt;Instead, we could leave the Extropians list as it is, and create a new,</i><br>
<i>&gt;additional list, say ExI-Members, or Extropians-Special, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropians-Insider</i><br>
<p>
This sounds like a much better suggestion to me.<br>
<p>
Here is a parable from railroad regulation.  Once upon a time railroads<br>
were regulated in part to force railroads to subsidize passenger traffic.<br>
When the trucking industry started to cut into railroad freight business,<br>
the regulators wouldn't let railroads cut their frieght prices, for fear<br>
they wouldn't have money to subsidize rail passengers.  Eventually there<br>
was little rail traffic left, but the regulators insisted on passenger<br>
subsidies still.  So the railroads went out of business.  Now the <br>
government directly subsidizes Amtrack passenger rail.<br>
<p>
There is a demand for this list, and so in principle there is an opportunity<br>
to "tax" list members to pay for "good things" done by ExI.  But it is not<br>
that hard to create competing mailing lists, so I don't think the tax <br>
could be very high.  Requiring ExI membership at $95/yr seems far too high.<br>
