<i>&gt; octopus which is native to the _Northeast_ Pacific.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am more inclined toward the brown octopus, which is found on both American</i><br>
<i>&gt; coasts, is much smaller, more studied and more common.</i><br>
<p>
 Okay, other people have nailed me on this one. Yes, I was assuming that the giant<br>
octopus was the only one worth considering, since trying to uplift a smaller one<br>
might turn out to be like trying to uplift a capuchin monkey. The carrying capacity<br>
of the larger frame seems better to me. The expense issue is about the same for<br>
cetaceans and primates: the bigger they are, the more they eat.<br>
<p>
I am aware that octopi (generic) are found lots of places. Sorry if my hurried<br>
assumptions made it seem as if I didn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But right now, the most dangerous</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals for you and me are humans.  I am more likely to be killed or injured</i><br>
<i>&gt; by a human, either intentionally or otherwise, then I am by any mollusc or</i><br>
<i>&gt; other organism, save microrganisms.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think you are taking the point I'm tryiing to make, which is that molluscs<br>
are very nearly as different from us, evolutionarily, as insects. This almost puts<br>
them in the microorganism camp {in the old joke about Tonto and the Lone Ranger, it<br>
wasn't the Lone Ranger who said, "What you mean, 'we'?").<br>
<p>
The points you make above are true but irrelevant--it is _you-all_ who are talking<br>
about making some other species of critter an *additional* potential threat. Please<br>
note that such potential is not something I invent; the potential is a consequence<br>
of the increased capabilities you-all propose to add.<br>
<p>
I think uplift is a fine thing to do once we aren't tethered to this particular<br>
ball of rock.<br>
<p>
I agree with you when you mention (in a portion of post I've elided for bandwidth's<br>
sake) that mammals are risky too. Someone mentioned wolverines--yeah, right.<br>
<p>
If they occupy the same niches as humans, they'll compete with us for the same<br>
resources but be at least easy to find. If they occupy very different niches,<br>
they'll hit resources we only dimly understand or have a handle on, and they'll be<br>
harder to neutralize if we ever war.<br>
<p>
Not when, but _if_.<br>
<p>
I am taking the "con" side in this argument because it's one I feel needs taking<br>
up--suppose "we" succeed in uplifting one or more species, but "we" screw up and<br>
the culture falls back to a stabler plateau for a while? One, say, at around the<br>
just-able-to-build-an-Aqualung level?<br>
<p>
It's customary for Europeans to regard Yanks as naive and not-worldly. :) :)<br>
This is not disasturbation, it's a question of prudence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Call me a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;chauvinist if you want to. I used to joke about what I thought would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;constitute a _real_ "crime against humanity"--giving house cats (F.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;domesticus) hands. I think uplifting octopi might be almost as bad.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think intelligence plus nonhuman form equals enemy of humanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, what will posthumans be?</i><br>
<p>
That remains to be seen, doesn't it? You talk as if there will be a standard-issue<br>
posthuman. "Expectation foils perception." We might _all_ be wrong. A very dear<br>
acquaintance of mine wanted to eat the universe until I convinced him some of us<br>
would make it harder for him. Others might take more convincing. I think the means<br>
of convincing are likely to be traditional.<br>
