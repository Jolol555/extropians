<i>&gt; &gt; ... Nouns, verbs, deixis,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anaphor and other such principles are the algorithms and heuristics by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which we make language. Never confuse language with thinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; JCB and the other Loglanists are mostly linguists, and mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt; pre-Chomsky (which is a plus in my book). "Universal Grammar" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the result of some very interesting empirical studies of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; language /as it is/ (the only way it can be empirical), but I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not for a moment concede that it has anything to say about what /can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be/.  </i><br>
<p>
Universal grammar is not the abstraction of the grammars of all known<br>
human languages; it is the theorized "operating system" that is<br>
_language_.  If the software (Lojban, Anasazi, Sumerian) doesn't conform<br>
to the needs of the OS, it won't run.  Do the current UG theories, <br>
government-binding and optimality, fully explain all details of syntax?<br>
No.  Are linguists all agreed in their use of the UG paradigm?  No.<br>
Linguistics is a young science and not yet in a period of "normal<br>
science."  This does not mean that the fundamental fact that Chomsky<br>
recognized is invalid, namely, human minds are built for language, build<br>
it in childhood using the terribly poor, incomplete examples around them,<br>
and invariably build it along identical lines.  This has earned him the<br>
eternal wrath of cultural relativists who want human nature to be<br>
alterable; of course, we want our nature to be alterable, too, but<br>
transhumanists recognize we need to change the hardware to do so.<br>
<p>
The acid test for Lojban would be, can children learn it and not creolize<br>
it?  If children are exposed to Lojban as a first language and what they<br>
create based on the evidence available to them is basically the same, it<br>
conforms to UG.  If they alter it radically or minutely, then the<br>
Lojbanists have made some fundamental mistakes about how to create a<br>
language usable by humans which makes logical relationships explicit.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The entire history of human language is a mere pittance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few millennia, and the serious study of linguistics a tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; fraction of that.  To draw any conclusions from such scant evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the height of irresponsible scientific hubris. </i><br>
<p>
A few millenia?  Most linguists and informed archaeologists reckon that<br>
language in its current form has existed for 60,000 to 200,000 years and<br>
language of less complicated structure (analogous to the stages children<br>
go through while acquiring language --vague words, more focused words,<br>
two-word sentences, telegraphic sentences) has existed since Homo erectus,<br>
1.5 million years ago.<br>
<p>
Age of a science is not a requisite for the accuracy of its theories.<br>
Yes, linguistics is a young science.  Our universe has existed for more<br>
than 15 billion years; is it irresponsible or hubristic to draw<br>
conclusions about the way it behaves because physics has existed for a<br>
tiny fraction of that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My own advocacy of the language is based on my own study and use;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I claim no credentials in the field, nor do I care what credentials</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else may have. </i><br>
<p>
That's certainly your right.  Such credentials are not given for towing<br>
the party line or sucking up any more (or any less) than in any other<br>
academic field.  Linguists as a population deserve to be listened to not<br>
because they have impressive degrees but because they've spent millions of<br>
hours paying attention to language in ways that others haven't; the same<br>
goes for physicists, oceanographers and computer scientists.<br>
<p>
 I am not one who takes a such things as<br>
<i>&gt; degrees or books sales seriously; I judge the final product, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; for my money, the Lojban group has done about 10 times the valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; work in linguistics than any modern Chomsky-worshipper I know.</i><br>
<p>
Why do you have such animosity for Chomsky or researchers working in his<br>
wake?  What, exactly, have Lojbanists actually done?  Made a (possibly)<br>
natural language that computers can parse better than English or Finnish?<br>
That says more about the limitations of contemporary computers compared<br>
to the parsing (and, more importantly, interpretation) ability of any<br>
human being. Lojban aims to minimize ambiguity.  Check.  English contains<br>
sentences like "Time flies like an arrow," which can be parsed any of a<br>
number of ways by a computer.  Check.  <br>
<p>
However if, in speech and not writing, I say to you "Hey, time flies like<br>
an arrow," I sincerely doubt you'll take it as "'time-flies' enjoy a<br>
particular arrow" or any other bizarre sense.  Why?  Because intonation<br>
plays a very important role in communicating meaning --I will stress the<br>
words differently depending on whether "time" and "flies" are a noun and a<br>
verb, a compound noun, etc.  Intonation and other prosodic features have<br>
generally been ignored in computational linguistics because such features<br>
are not as easy to quantify as word-as-symbol or phoneme-as-component.<br>
<p>
Phonology is a tricky area; we hear phonological distinctions that aren't<br>
there in the accoustics.  Until we can get a computer to make the same<br>
context-sensitive distinctions and interpretations that any neurologically<br>
and anatomically normal 5-year-old can, we don't know enough about speech<br>
perception and production to try and alter the basics of language.<br>
