Wow.<br>
<p>
Went home today after two weeks working abroad (fun but long hours),<br>
running all day, no time for E-mail. No Sat-phone on the plane, how<br>
primitive...<br>
More waiting... Patience is not my strong point I guess ;-)<br>
<p>
But o joy of joys!, I got home and downloaded my mail.<br>
Fantastic, that's the only word I have for it.<br>
<p>
I've been sorting out all the posts from the list and E-mails sent to me<br>
privately (_lot's_ of those!) containing ideas for a new name. Everybody<br>
who sent something is eligeble for the $100 Amazon certificate (digital,<br>
untraceble and tax-free).<br>
<p>
There is no doubt in my mind that a suitable solution will be found.<br>
Already I've seen some real beauties!<br>
<p>
A short reply to some posts (can't ignore her - or the name):<br>

Well... That could be considered a Greek reference and we do our best to be<br>
cooperative. But:  there definitely are limits!!!!         ;-)<br>
If you are looking for a shock-effect, forget it. We people don't shock on<br>
these issues (as long as it's voluntary). Kirsten, please don't take this<br>
badly but I honestly fear you won't win with this entry ;-) Feel free to<br>
give it another try though.<br>

<p>
Maybe we should clearly state the nature and extent of the relationship<br>
between ExI and the Dutch Transhumanist Society( whatever it will be<br>
called) on our websites and update it as we progress. Just say were it's<br>
at, it can only add to our respectability if we show that we're grown-up<br>
enough to teamwork very well in spite of some differences.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I do find it puzzling and frustrating that a group that explicitly (a) does</i><br>
<i> &gt;not want to be part of Extropy Institute, and (b) does not consider itself</i><br>
<i> &gt;Extropian, nevertheless would choose a name (and an arrow emblem) that will</i><br>
<i> &gt;suggest Extropianism to many people. It seems clear to me that a more</i><br>
<i> &gt;distinctive name would serve both organizations better.</i><br>
<p>
So if we choose a non-Ex name, will the arrow be OK? Mabe it can become the<br>
universal symbol of all Transhumanists? I mean, Extropians are<br>
Transhumanists aren't they? It should be noted that Henri came up with the<br>
Logo (like the name) before he was on this list and knew much of ExI. I<br>
guess this just show it's a universally good idea.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I've happy to see the constructive approach being taken by Berrie and</i><br>
<i> &gt;Arjen. I'm impressed by the offer of a reward for coming up with an</i><br>
<i> &gt;acceptable alternative name. (I do like Daedalus. Or: The Prometheus</i><br>
<i> &gt;Transhuman Society...) That's the spirit. That's such a capitalistic</i><br>
<i> &gt;approach that maybe you guys should reconsider whether or not you are</i><br>
<i> &gt;Extropian. :-) </i><br>
<p>
AS I said before, this list might make a libertarian out of me someday ;-)<br>
I have actually been retinking much of my political ideas, I might still be<br>
a  leftie but thanks to people like Anton (and Lee Daniel) I can at least<br>
understand &amp; respect your arguments.<br>
<p>
And of course: Emergency's and hard ca$h always brings out the best in people.<br>
 (Hey, my name is Arjen, not stupid ;-)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;The name issue aside, I'm thrilled to see organizational activity starting</i><br>
<i> &gt;up in Europe.</i><br>
 //snip //<br>
<i> &gt;In recognition of that, the</i><br>
<i> &gt;forthcoming issue of the ExI members' newsletter, Exponent, carries a</i><br>
<i> &gt;feature on European Extropians.</i><br>
<p>
Max, could you contact me about how we might obtain a copy? (hard or soft).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Finally, Arjen, I was not claiming that Extropianism is well known in</i><br>
<i> &gt;Europe. Of course it is not. However, saying that probably not even a</i><br>
<i> &gt;hundred have heard of it was so far off the mark,</i><br>
<p>
Yes, problably it was in retrospect, we meant no offence. Since we agree<br>
that a lot of work remains to be done we'll concentrate on that (more fun<br>
too!).<br>
<p>
 Let's just be careful<br>
<i> &gt;to help put a spring in each others' step, not step on each others' toes!</i><br>
<p>
We're with you! Looking forward to further cooperation.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Onward!</i><br>
<p>
Contact, Ignition &amp; Launch!<br>
<p>
Arjen<br>
<p>
P.S. to everybody who mailed me personally: Thankyou for your ideas and<br>
opinions<br>
When I've caught up with my sleep-shortage I will reply to y'all personally.<br>
