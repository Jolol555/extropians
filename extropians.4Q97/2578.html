I'd add one other point to what Twirlip wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; more blood won't be spilt.  There is no valid purpose today to own or use a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gun, unless you are an enforcer of the law, and it is absolutely dire that</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And we can all trust all of the enforcers of the law!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Do you think that gangs would be as previlent today if</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the members went around armed with wooden sticks?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Feudalism."</i><br>
<p>
These two are interrelated. Some of the laws around the world still in<br>
effect are to my mind extremely uncivilized and relics of feudal thinking.<br>
<p>
Are all laws created equal? If a law were enacted tomorrow, not necessarily<br>
here in the Good Ol' US of A, that turned all left-handed people into<br>
slaves, would it be all right, because it was the law?<br>
<p>
How about the place where chewing gum on the rapid transit system is a<br>
capital offense? I swear I am not making this up. This is the genuine<br>
current state of affairs there.<br>
<p>
If you got instantly teleported into a train car there, and got caught with<br>
chewing gum that happened to be in your pocket, are you honestly going to<br>
tell me that it would be _right_ and _fair_ and _just_ that you be put to<br>
death by enforcers of that law?<br>
<p>
So the question becomes:<br>
<p>
And we can all trust all of the enforcers of *ALL* the laws? No matter what?<br>
