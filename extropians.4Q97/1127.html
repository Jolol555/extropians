I've always felt with the Cypherpunks that while they are on the<br>
fringe, they are pulling us in the right direction. Sometimes you have <br>
to go to far in one direction to bring the rest with you, even if<br>
halfway.<br>
<p>
I seem to remember an article in Wired Mag about the Extropians, and<br>
the disdainful letters in the letters column the next month. The<br>
general feeling was "It's a shame the extropians couldnt use their<br>
powers for good and not spend their time with their heads in the<br>
clouds." and painted Max and crew as juvenile daydreamers, not unlike<br>
your juvenile paranoids in the Cypherpunks.<br>
