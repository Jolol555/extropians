Some comments and personal experience with being stateless:<br>
<p>
As everybody gets born in a place for which some territorial power structure<br>
has a claim, each person becomes a citizen of something; the following option<br>
is to denounce it, and then you can be treated as an ex-citizen, unless that<br>
entity has dissolved.  I was stripped of my Soviet citizenship in 1989 as a<br>
person who was trying to leave the country.  I didn't want to do it - it was my<br>
country, even though it was occupied by the bad guys, bad laws, and stupidly<br>
configured territory.  Still, there were things and people I loved there, I definitely<br>
did more to create value there than those who took my rights away - but that's<br>
the rule.  Anyway, this is personal and not really relevant.  <br>
So I am now an ex-citizen of an ex-regime of an ex-country.<br>
In U.S. I have refugee status turned into permanent residence (and the right to<br>
obtain the citizenship which I do not hurry to execute).<br>
I can work here, own property, travel around.  I can't vote.<br>
Have to pay taxes, don't have to do the jury duty, or army service.<br>
Travel to Canada takes only a driving licence, it's easy.<br>
For travel to Europe, I need to apply for "refugee travel permit" - it probably<br>
would be some other kind of permit for somebody who is not a refugee.<br>
<p>
I think real problems may arise when you or the country you are currently<br>
in, would get into some kind of trouble, as there is no authority that is<br>
interested in protecting your interests.<br>
<p>
All non-country-based citizenships I know of issue play-papers, nobody<br>
really recognizes them.  Maybe  there are better ones.  I haven't really<br>
researched it; would be grateful for some useful information.<br>
<p>
A good thing about being stateless maybe that since there are very few such<br>
people, the governments may not have put a lot of effort into regulating their<br>
lives and figuring out how to take away their money.<br>
<p>
It may be useful to start a community of stateless persons - a global "phyle"<br>
that would protect your interests and supply you with some information - in<br>
exchange for financial or other contributions.  What would be a good name for it?<br>
Anybody knows the etymology of the word "citizen" ?<br>
