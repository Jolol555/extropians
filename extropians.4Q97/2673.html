    Yes you're right when you say that it is the person, not the gun.  But we<br>
know that not everyone is responsible.  In fact many aren't.  And when<br>
responsible gun owners promote the ownership and production of guns, you know<br>
well that just as many will fall into the hands of someone unresponsible.  But<br>
yes the best thing to do would be to change how people think, not what people<br>
do with guns.  I think if we could change the way people think, there would be<br>
a lot less reasons for guns to be produced anyways.<br>
