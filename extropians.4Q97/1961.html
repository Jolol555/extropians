<p>
Futurologists (or any forecasters in the social or natural sciences) will tell you<br>
that prediction/forecasting beyond 20 years is folly.  I think this is sort of<br>
like the extropian idea of the Singularity. Brilliant people like Stephen Hawking<br>
does talk about "Baby Universes" that could be pinched off from our own (possibly<br>
from wormholes) and the possibility of traveling to a prior point in time within<br>
this universe is also plausible.  These notions are more likely to me than saving<br>
a part of the current cosmos we live in per se. Sincerely, Bill<br>
