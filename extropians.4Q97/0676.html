THe thing is, that, despite people's concepts of the "Singularity" being<br>
a place or goal set and fixed, to anyone familiar with the concept, they<br>
know that a singularity is always unreachable. When you think you got<br>
there, it went and moved on you. It's the penultimate end of the<br>
rainbow. The more capable, the more transhuman you becom, your own<br>
conception of what the "Singularity" will be like moves that much<br>
farther ahead. Of course, there will tend to be a contraction over time<br>
as to the foreseeable event horizion, but nobody will ever reach their<br>
own "singularity", except for death. Death is the end of the line, so<br>
once you die, then you are there. Possibly with the exception of those<br>
whose sigularity is the now, that they can imagine nothing beyond what<br>
they are now. Those people are already walking dead... SO, if your<br>
phrase is meaninless, then its the right one for the job.<br>
