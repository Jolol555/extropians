That pretty much sums up how we're talking past each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok, how about Specialized lists??? Just so you don't have to admit your</i><br>

<p>
Pot and kettle, friend.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I joined the list after it went public as well, but was a member of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhuman list long before that, and was waiting for a while for</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians to open up.</i><br>
<p>
And I predicated my joining on it being closed, and was disturbed when I<br>
discovered it wasn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You don't see network television as elitist media? EXCUSE ME??? REALITY</i><br>

I said "no more than". As a mathematics-competent person, you shuold be<br>
able to re-read what I said and see that I might have meant (and did<br>
intend) an inequality, less-than-or-equal. It is you who turned that into<br>
an equals sign.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't see this as isolationist. Nor any more elitist than a gas station.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; TANSTAAFL. My attention is worth something, AND SO IS YOURS. Get it? :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the current market rate. No, not your personal rate, the MARKET</i><br>
<i>&gt; RATE. </i><br>
<p>
Beside the point, since Max has stated he does not want to make money per<br>
se from the list.<br>
<p>
Seeing the utter lack of successful pay subscription services on<br>
<i>&gt; the net, the value of your attention, on a statistical basis, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; effectively nil.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps, but I don't use my attention statistically, nor in the Joe&amp;Marge<br>
Sixpack pursuits of watching the Simpsons or X-files or Home Improvement<br>
or football.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Allow me to render a free translation: We should be perfect people, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then any system would work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ad hominem et al....</i><br>
<p>
I don't see an ad hominem here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;THose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;who are too stubbornly newbie for it to have any effect on usually dig</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;themselves deep enough for some real fun once they get into rude enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't want to play that game so much any more.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the star of Starship Stroopers says: A Citizen is a person who makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; the survival of the human race a matter of their personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. And this list could help more if it were higher signal. QED.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Au contraire. The tragedy of the commons is being enacted out all around us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your motives speak for themselves. You are a) Trying to figure out a way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to limit the level of participation in the list in a manner that</i><br>
<i>&gt; hopefully increases the average intelligence of the list content. b) You</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose to do this by charging people for posting priviledges, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; tantamount to a tariff on the free exchange of ideas. Your error is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you wrongly assume that there aren't people who don't mind spending</i><br>
<i>&gt; money for the right to be complete idiots.</i><br>
<p>
I didn't assume that. You assume I assume that: that the pricetag will<br>
suffice. It won't. But it *will* prevent an inordinate number of bad<br>
examples from giving newbies bad lessons. I'll filter too, if I have to. I<br>
want to try the experiment. You are convinced it won't work.<br>
<p>
We don't have a lot more to say to each other on this topic, I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; free. If Max wants to make money on the list, I suggest he use his free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market rights and start using advertising as an income source.</i><br>
<p>
But he doesn't, so that's that. :) :)<br>
<p>
Cordially,<br>
