Overall, I agree with the original poster that this is an interesting<br>
and likely very useful technology, which will have large<br>
implications. But I don't think his paranoia about the FDA and Big<br>
Business hiding it is warranted, and while I think it may be good for<br>
many developing countries it will not likely remove the pharmaceutical<br>
gigants.<br>

<i>&gt;The new methods have the power to trash the entire pharmaceutical</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry and put control in the hands of the "little guy".</i><br>
<p>
How? While this method seems to avoid many of the current problems<br>
with vaccines and may be much cheaper, I seriously don't think the<br>
pharmaceutical industry will be much changed by it (se<br>
below). Besides, vaccines are just a minor part of the industry - what<br>
would really trash it would be remedies against common ailments<br>
anybody could cook, with no ability to patent them).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Theoretically, it could be applied</i><br>
<i>&gt;to every situation where a protein is needed. Injection of a gene into</i><br>
<i>&gt;muscle tissue could not only lead to antigen production but also make</i><br>
<i>&gt;the host tissue produce a naturally occurring hormone such as human</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth hormone.</i><br>
<p>
You are mixing it up with gene therapy. DNA based immunization is<br>
based on that a few cells will produce antigens, which stimulates the<br>
immune system to seek out the real virus. For gene therapy you need<br>
much larger amounts than that. Scaling up the effect is highly<br>
nontrivial, as the gene therapy people are realizing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eventually, there may be small PC-size</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines that at the cost of a desktop computer can function as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;complete pharmaceutical production facility. They can be connected to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Net and able to churn out any kind of nucleic acid /</i><br>
<i>&gt;pharmaceutical at almost zero cost. Needless to say, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;decentralization threatens the power of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pharmaceutical giants and their multibillion-dollar protein</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry.</i><br>
<p>
No. Guess who will sell the machines? The software? Who will own the<br>
patents of the genes you download? (would you seriously want to<br>
download a shareware gene?). <br>
<p>
In the long run I agree with you, the huge pharmaceutical companies<br>
will disappear. But they will become software gigants instead, doing<br>
the research and development for the software you run in your own<br>
medi-PC. It may be pay-for-use: you are debited for the plasmids you<br>
order it to produce (or other pharmaceuticals; Greg Egan had a<br>
believable such device in his book _Distress_).<br>
<p>
According to the FAQ (<a href="http://www.genweb.com/Dnavax/faq.html">http://www.genweb.com/Dnavax/faq.html</a>) there is<br>
also a patent for the process:<br>
<p>
	Who owns the patents to DNA vaccination?<br>
      <br>
	This question began to be answered on December 2nd, 1996 when<br>
	it was announced that Vical, Inc. had been awarded a United<br>
	States patent covering the use of a "DNA sequence... free from<br>
	association with transfection-facilitating proteins, viral<br>
	particles, liposomal formulations, charged lipids and calcium<br>
	phosphate precipitating agents"<br>
<p>
(Although there may be prior art.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is vastly cheaper than the conventional method that</i><br>
<i>&gt;relies on proteins. Nucleic acids don’t have to be refrigerated and</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be stored without solution.</i><br>
<p>
Is this true? I seem to recall that while they are fairly stable, they<br>
tend to break up anyway.<br>
<p>
What worries me a bit is the safety of this procedure. How well has it<br>
been studied?<br>
