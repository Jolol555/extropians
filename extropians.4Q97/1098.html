<i>&gt; "The latest developments in the 20-year project, including the vital</i><br>
<i>&gt; step of achieving respiration in the transplanted heads, have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; reported in an American scientific journal by Robert White, professor</i><br>
<i>&gt; of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have not been able to find it in Medline, though. Anybody else who</i><br>
<i>&gt; can dig up the original reference? Somehow I think the Times may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; exaggerating things.</i><br>

Not the a reference to recent work, but a review of his earlier work:<br>

Neurol Res 1996 Jun;18(3):194-203 <br>
<p>
The isolation and transplantation of the brain. An<br>
historical perspective emphasizing the surgical solutions to<br>
the design of these classical models.<br>

<p>
Following an historical review of earlier attempts to develop<br>
separated head and brain preparations and their contributions to<br>
modern-day understanding of the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of<br>
the central nervous system, the experiments that eventually led to the<br>
first successful total isolation of the mammalian brain are presented.<br>
The operative strategies emphasizing the anatomical and physiological<br>
problems requiring solution that resulted in vascular and neurogenic<br>
separation from the parent body and cephalon are described. The<br>
innovative engineering concepts that were utilized in the design of<br>
miniaturized equipment to maintain the isolated brain in a living<br>
state under conditions of cross circulation, extracorporeal artificial<br>
perfusion and transplantation are elaborated. Investigations employing<br>
isolated brain and cephalic preparation documenting tissue substrate<br>
requirements, metabolic and rheological conditions prevailing at<br>
various low temperatures and the immunologically privileged state of<br>
the separated organ are briefly presented. The unique opportunities<br>
these isolated brain models offer for study are emphasized as well as<br>
the complexity of their surgical preparation, which, to date, has<br>
limited their universal applications. <br>
