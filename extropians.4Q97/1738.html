<p>
I've not seen any studies done on giant octopodes that make them appear more<br>
likely candidates.  To make an analogy, the dolphin appears more intelligent<br>
than<br>
the blue whale.  So, larger might not mean better.  Humans are also smaller than<br>
a lot of other land mammals, from elephants on down, yet our intelligence seems<br>
-- anybody want to argue otherwise?:) -- much more than theirs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; But right now, the most dangerous</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

molluscs<br>

almost puts<br>
<i>&gt;them in the microorganism camp {in the old joke about Tonto and the Lone</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ranger, it wasn't the Lone Ranger who said, "What you mean, 'we'?").</i><br>
<p>
Do you assume that uplifted octopodes would see humans as a threat?  I think<br>
there is more reason to assume otherwise.  (I admit, I would not try to uplift<br>
insects.:)  We live in different environments and our ecologies are a bit<br>
different<br>
too.  (Admittedly, humans do eat octopodes and many of the things that<br>
octopodes prey on, but octopodes do not raid human farms or livestock --<br>
for now.:)<br>
<p>
It seems like a kind of speciescentrism -- akin to racism.  If Black learn<br>
to read<br>
and write...  If octopodes...  See the similarity?<br>
<p>
If this fear is valid, why not wipe out any species that might threaten us now?<br>
Why not exterminate dolphins and nonhuman primates?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The points you make above are true but irrelevant--it is _you-all_ who are</i><br>
talking<br>
<i>&gt;about making some other species of critter an *additional* potential</i><br>
threat. Please<br>
<i>&gt;note that such potential is not something I invent; the potential is a</i><br>
consequence<br>
<i>&gt;of the increased capabilities you-all propose to add.</i><br>
<p>
The assumption here is that smarter octopodes would not change in any other<br>
relevant way.  Yet humans today do not live like our ancestors.  We do not<br>
scavange after lion kills, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If they occupy the same niches as humans, they'll compete with us for the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources but be at least easy to find. If they occupy very different niches,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they'll hit resources we only dimly understand or have a handle on, and</i><br>
they'll be<br>
<i>&gt;harder to neutralize if we ever war.</i><br>
<p>
That is far fetched.  If there is war, what makes you think that all<br>
octopodes would<br>
be antihuman?  What makes you think there would be a sort of species wide<br>
consensus?  Aside from that, we humans do now possess an understanding of<br>
octopodes' needs and limits, greater than theirs of ours.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not when, but _if_.</i><br>
<p>
A big if.  It might be humanity that teaches octopodes war NOT vice versa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am taking the "con" side in this argument because it's one I feel needs</i><br>
taking<br>
<i>&gt;up--suppose "we" succeed in uplifting one or more species, but "we" screw</i><br>
up and<br>
<i>&gt;the culture falls back to a stabler plateau for a while? One, say, at</i><br>
around the<br>
<i>&gt;just-able-to-build-an-Aqualung level?</i><br>
<p>
What if we don't uplift and the culture falls back?  That would be a<br>
disaster too.<br>
I'd hate to live in the Dark Ages... the pre1997s.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I don't think intelligence plus nonhuman form equals enemy of humanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If so, what will posthumans be?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That remains to be seen, doesn't it? You talk as if there will be a</i><br>
standard-issue<br>
<i>&gt;posthuman. "Expectation foils perception." We might _all_ be wrong. A very dear</i><br>
<i>&gt;acquaintance of mine wanted to eat the universe until I convinced him some</i><br>
of us<br>
<i>&gt;would make it harder for him. Others might take more convincing. I think</i><br>
the means<br>
<i>&gt;of convincing are likely to be traditional.</i><br>
<p>
The problem here is What if we don't do it?  That has consequences too.  Also,<br>
the cat is out of the bag.  If someone wants to do it, it will be done.  I<br>
think it is<br>
only an engineering problem.  If anything of your worst case scenarios are true,<br>
then it might be better to have many uplifted species than one.  Balance of<br>
power!<br>
