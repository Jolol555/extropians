I find that I am somewhat confused by the use of the term "Singularity" by<br>
members of this list.<br>
<p>
I've read Vernor Vinges essay by that same name..it's been some time<br>
ago...and it's a little vauge...and I have no current web acces...so I may be<br>
mistaken...but I remember nothing regarding the web turning intelligent, all<br>
humanity being subsumed into one vast Hive mind, or even "Powers"...(which is<br>
a Vingean Literary invention...true...but purely SF...right?)<br>
<p>
I have little math...it doesn't stick...I've learned Calculus several<br>
times...and forget it almost immediately...but from what I understand the<br>
word "Singularity" is a mathematical term...<br>
<p>
Astronomers use it in the mathematical sense when referring to a "Black<br>
Hole"..<br>
<p>
My understanding is that it means  that up to a point things may be<br>
calculated mathematically...the point beyond which they may NOT be<br>
calculated...where the numbers turn weird...where predictions are<br>
impossible...is the singularity...<br>
<p>
Extrapolating current trends leads us to beleive we are approaching a<br>
(mathematically defined) singularity...but since it IS a singularity we can<br>
know nothing about what is beyond it...<br>
<p>
This does not preclude the possibility that it has happened in the<br>
past...perhaps many times...for example I reference Toffler's book "The Third<br>
Wave"...would not each of his "waves" qualify as a singularity?<br>
<p>
I welcome explanations from those more wise than I.<br>
