<p>
The problem is that you cannot just eliminate the reptilian brain - it<br>
is essential to our functioning on a very deep level (motivation,<br>
attention, basic awareness, body control, wakefulness etc). We should<br>
instead strive to refine it into something more survivable.<br>
<p>
The common view of the brain/mind as advanced systems built on top of<br>
more primitive systems, overriding their functions with "civilization"<br>
is largely wrong. What we neuroscientists are arriving at is almost<br>
the reverse: the "primitive" systems are really the core of our being,<br>
our basic and most important functions, and the other systems just add<br>
new capabilities. So what we should do is to add more<br>
layers/capabilities of course (like a broad computer/brain interface,<br>
making it possible to "plug in" software), and to find ways of<br>
refining the core structures so that they no longer hinder us from our<br>
goals. This is extremely hard and dangerous, but somebody has to do<br>
it.<br>
<p>
In an uploaded form this would be significantly easier than in a<br>
biological form, since we can always undo changes, make backups and<br>
run parallel copies of ourselves.<br>
