<i>&gt;&gt; THE PRIMARY QUESTION of logical inquiry </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Must be "what is identity?" </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, that's THE SECONDARY QUESTION. </i><br>
<i>&gt;THE PRIMARY QUESTION must be "Hey, is this thing on?"</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: And if A is on, for example where A <br>
 is a lightbulb, then we have at the same <br>
 time defined some area that is not on.<br>
<p>
 Notice, for example, that when a light <br>
 is on, or luminous, the area around it <br>
 is not luminous... cool... or cool &amp; hot.<br>
<p>
 Were it not for that not-Luminosity there<br>
 would be no Luminosity,  therefore not-L<br>
 is a necessary feature of L. If L is all<br>
 those things necessary for its existence,<br>
 all those things apart from which L cannot<br>
 exist, then L = not-L.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Until we answer </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; That question, all other inquiry is illogical. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...and therefore naughty.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Extremely naughty, horrible, <br>
 even sinful... "people who want <br>
 you to think that should live <br>
 in a zoo," and stuff like that.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; A thing, a state of difference, A, is an identity. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, yes, obviously that. I mean, if we can't agree that A is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity, a state of difference, a thing, then what can we agree on? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing, I'd say. (Oops! I'm jumping ahead!)</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Or for that matter, maybe everything.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Every identity is derived from relation. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You are your own grandfather.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: My grandfather had many<br>
 features... I'm one of them.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; There is no identity that is not derived from relation. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; There can be no identity that is not derived from relation. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Except for "Manos" (The Hands of Fate). Manos has no derivation. Manos</i><br>
<i>&gt;just is. </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Everything just is,<br>
 ergo: Manos = everything.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Therefore "relation" cannot be separated from "identity," </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not without the Jaws of Life, anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And therefore, as relation contains both A and not-A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...and not-both-A...</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: I.e., nothing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; What a thing is said not to be cannot truthfully </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Be separated from what it is said to be. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(See Jaws of Life comment above.)</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: I did, but it was about as <br>
 explanitory as this reference to it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The assumed separation of A and not-A is therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A fallacy. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...and even more naughty than illogical inquiry.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: It is indeed an atrocity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If A is not separate from not-A, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Then A is not-A: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A = not-A </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or, more elegantly:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A !=&lt;&gt;= !A + some_other_stuff</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: (A + not-A) includes "some_other_stuff"<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If there is nothing A is not, A is everything.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Including pasties. Maybe even especially pasties. (Woo hoo!)</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: No... especially everything.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If A is everything, A is no thing, A is nothing, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And thus everything is nothing... Logical Zen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But what is nothing? Something? A nice snack? (Yes, thank you. A donut</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you have one.) </i><br>
<p>
 IAN: What is something? Hay, that was <br>
 the original question... wasn't it?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; So the answer to the primary question as to the nature </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Of identity is that identity is nothing, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, the answer to the real primary question (see comments above) is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Yes, it is." Not that your question/answer isn't also profound.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: That's not an answer, but it <br>
 sure saves time, and other stuff.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; identity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; False where it assumes separation, and that is true. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Truth is that separation assumes, where it is false, identity is. Just ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yoda. </i><br>
<i>&gt;(See <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3109/newgammar.html">http://www.theonion.com/onion3109/newgammar.html</a> for more profundity.)</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Christians assume there's this<br>
 God that is a some real big dude.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Identity is not identity, different is same.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any 10 year old could tell you this. But I'm glad you said it, anyway, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;the elderly on the list might also benefit, and grow thereby.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Well, I guess I had that <br>
 feeling that you needed some <br>
 growth... glad I could help.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Separation does not exist. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unless you really, really believe in it with all your heart.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Err, not even then. Same <br>
 goes for Santa Clause... sorry.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; No thing is apart from the whole. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now you're getting personal!</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: You are unified with <br>
 the whole, but hay, so is <br>
 everyone. It's so common.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Every thing is the whole. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And now you're being rude!</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: Down right.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Everything is whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh. Well, that's not so bad, I guess. If you'd ended all of that with</i><br>
<i>&gt;everything being torn asunder and strewn about, we'd have quite a logical</i><br>
<i>&gt;mess to clean up. Your tidiness and manners are greatly appreciated.</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: I thought I was rude... Oh <br>
 I see, rude is not-rude... cool.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. Sorry for the "Me, too." post. I'll try to have more to add next</i><br>
<i>&gt;time!</i><br>
<p>
 IAN: I can't imagine how you could <br>
 add more to what you have already.<br>
