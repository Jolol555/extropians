This information claims to be from the RISKS digest, which is a <br>
reputable moderated digest, but I haven't checked to see whether<br>
the attribution is legit.  I decided to send it on to y'all<br>
anyway since the list volume has been so low lately.<br>
<p>
(BTW: While we're feuding with the InterNIC, send your posts to<br>
extropians@extropy.com and NOT to extropians@extropy.org, even<br>
though the latter is the preferred long-term address.  I hope that<br>
the problems with InterNIC are just a temporary "sickness", but<br>
the InterNIC is not exactly a competitive consumer-friendly business.)<br>

 Subject: Risks of installing Internet Explorer 4.0
 
 I just downloaded and installed Microsoft Internet Exploder 4.0 onto my PC
running Windows 95 at home.  Among the optional features that come with
this release are a few tidbits that were included with Plus!, the
mostly-useless set of bells and whistles that was packaged separately from
Windows 95.
<p>
 Two of these features are opaque window manipulation (when you move or
resize a window, the entire window moves in real time, rather than a
rubberband representation being tweaked) and anti-aliasing of large fonts.
The anti-aliasing feature is quite useful; it makes fonts in large point
sizes noticeably less pixelated.  However, in this feature lies a small,
and somewhat malicious, piece of code.
<p>
  This snippet of code apparently checks to see whether it is being asked
to render a font by the Netscape Navigator browser (or, indeed, any
component of the Communicator 4.x suite).  If it is, it gives back a plain
old jagged-edged font; otherwise, in every instance I have been able to
check, it gives back an anti-aliased font.
<p>
  This appears to be a clear instance of discriminatory coding on the part
of Microsoft, and is intended, one presumes, to make Navigator look
somewhat cruddy in comparison with MSIE (not to mention all of the other
software on a system).  It begs a troubling question: what other features
were included in MSIE 4.0 that were intended to, in some sense, impede the
software of Microsoft's competitors?
