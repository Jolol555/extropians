I thank Mike Butler for his sane and balanced post (Sunday).<br>
<p>
: Anton is "guilty" of proclaiming his acquisition of old<br>
: tech, and in that sense it is no more relevant than, say,<br>
: my announcing that I bought a new "beater" $1000 car.<br>
<p>
Mea culpa.  Worse was my taste in language: describing myself as <br>
"gun loon" and "threat to public order" was appropriate for the <br>
other recipients, but not for this list.<br>
<p>
My interest in guns has several roots.  First, the future: I bet<br>
even money that the USA will either break up or go fascist within<br>
15 years, and learning to shoot is one way to make myself more<br>
ready.  Abolition of violence would be nice but ain't gonna happen<br>
by then.  Second, the present: I want to be able to do more than<br>
call 911 if necessary.  (A few months ago I picked up my pistol<br>
on hearing a predawn cry for help.  The incident proved to be<br>
minor, but what if?)  Third but not least, I enjoy the technology<br>
of guns, and the simple pleasure of learning to hit a target.<br>
<p>
Each of these three purposes, I contend, is extropian in spirit,<br>
though none requires future technology - any more than calorie<br>
restriction or aikido!<br>
<p>
Two years ago when I brought home my first gun, my then rentmate<br>
(who owns five) said, "Congratulations. May you never need it."<br>
