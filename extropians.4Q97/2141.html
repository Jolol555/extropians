Before this list gets moderated, I thought I'd toss some thoughts out to<br>
the list.  I've been lurking for about a month and expect to return to<br>
lurk mode quickly, so don't bother killfiling me. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Re: Steve Sickle's Hyde Park plan.</i><br>
<p>
This seems to be the most reasonable alternative to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Re: James Rogers' stock recommendations.</i><br>
<p>
Cisco &amp; Intel dominate their markets.  In order to grow their revenues to<br>
match the expectations shown by their current P/E ratios, they will have<br>
to grow the market itself substantially, as well as fight off competitors<br>
who would love to grab market share, and the associated profits.<br>
<p>
I have trouble seeing the PC market growing substantially, or Intel's<br>
market share (&gt;90% ?) growing.  In fact, I see signs that many people are<br>
buying lower cost PC's when they do eventually buy.  I don't see anything<br>
sparking a drive towards P2's by the public, either.  Windows 98 will run<br>
fine on a Pentium with enough RAM &amp; HD.  Excel, Word, et cetera.  Quake II<br>
will be helped more by a Voodoo graphics card than a new processor.  The<br>
internet, Netscape on a 56K modem certainly doesn't require more than a<br>
Pentium, even including all the current Java mini-apps.<br>
<p>
As for Cisco.  Well, I work for Newbridge, so I'm biased.  Obviously, I<br>
think this market will grow substantially.  But, will Cisco continue to<br>
dominate so completely?  They don't have the advantage that Intel does in<br>
that competitors (like Newbridge) don't have to clone Cisco products, just<br>
interwork with them.<br>
<p>
I'm new to the stock market -- 6 months ago I was a farmboy going to<br>
school, now I'm an engineer in a market short of engineers.  I certainly<br>
timed my graduation right.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Re: books.</i><br>
<p>
Because of this list, I just finished reading Rucker's Infinity &amp; the<br>
Mind, and Drexler's Nanosystems.  So keep referring to books so I know<br>
what to pick up!  (That recent conversation concerning updating the<br>
Extropian recommended book list was great).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Re: politics.</i><br>
<p>
This list finished converting me to Libertarianism.  I was close before, I<br>
just needed the push.  If you're familiar with Canadian politics, I kept<br>
flipping back and forth between the socialist New Democrats and the<br>
extreme right wing Reform Party, and found myself very confused.  Now I've<br>
found a home.  :)  I joined the Freedom Party in Ontario here, but haven't<br>
received anything from them yet.<br>
<p>
Partly, it's a reaction, because I now live in perhaps one of the most<br>
over-governed regions in the world -- Ottawa, Canada.  The suburb I work<br>
in, Kanata, is much worse.<br>
<p>
So, are there any extropians here in Ottawa, or a surrounding area, like<br>
Montreal? I'd be interested in meeting with anybody.  Unfortunately, I<br>
don't speak French, although I can stumble along in Japanese...<br>
<p>
And now back to lurk mode,<br>
Bryan<br>
