<i>&gt;That having been said, after relatively scant experience with it (a</i><br>
<i>&gt;handful of books over the past few months) I see the outlines of theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or minimally of a set of extensions to the generally conceived</i><br>
<i>&gt;folk-psychological theory.</i><br>
<p>
A theory is usually implied in any of this stuff.  Making it explicit<br>
is the first step toward refining it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd characterize the key insights of NLP thus:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1)  One's identity and emotional landscape are malleable.  Indeed, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are constantly changing in response to our internal dialog, subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience, interpretation of that experience, the social mirror, etc..</i><br>
<p>
Insight?  I'd be more likely to call it a banality.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This forms a feedback loop where [ identity &amp; emotional landscape ]</i><br>
<i>&gt;-affects-&gt; action (including internal dialog) -affects-&gt; [ identity &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional landscape ].  Thus if we wish to affect our future identity &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional landscape, we can do so by modifying our subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience, and also by taking certain actions that sculpt our future</i><br>
<i>&gt;selves.</i><br>
<p>
Again, this seems commonplace, though it might be good to make<br>
it explicit, given the need to come up with a good theory of identity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)  Our subjective experience is constructed from multiple qualia, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;is usefully sculptable at this level.  This is elementary cog sci, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;rarely put into use.  For example, most of us at some time use internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;dialog to reason or motivate ourselves.  However, it is far less common</i><br>
<i>&gt;to find individuals who consciously create imagery, sounds, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;kinesthetic experiences with the intent of self-motivation or more</i><br>
<i>&gt;generally self-modification.  (Though I do grant that abstract thinkers</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely often use visual imagination to explore abstract ideas.)</i><br>
<p>
An instance of this might be anorexics who generally start the dieting <br>
process by "seeing" themselves as extremely obese.  They try to<br>
picture themselves as overly fat when they look in the mirror.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The essence of the NLP "cure" to the phobia, then, is to have the phobic</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual imagine the subject of their phobia in a small, distant,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unthreatening way.</i><br>
<p>
It all sounds very interesting, but does it work?  And as compared to <br>
other cures, what is its success rate?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To me this points to a basic tenet that the /intensity/ and /immediacy/</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a sensation (including an imagined sensation) is proportional to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;intensity of the emotional response evoked.   Again, fairly elementary</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the face of it - the insight of NLP is to use the imagination to</i><br>
<i>&gt;/change/ the intensity and immediacy of a stimuli to evoke the desired</i><br>
<i>&gt;response.</i><br>
<p>
I believe there is some precedent for this.  NLP might have deep roots.<br>
For example, it would seem that Aristotle's theory of tragedian is<br>
based on the notion that the guided (by the poet) action of the drama<br>
can effect changes in the audience's emotional makeup.  See my:<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8422/ust1.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8422/ust1.htm</a> and the<br>
references contained therein.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, NLP is very much an attempt to leverage our</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjective experience to augment our objective capabilities.  In this</i><br>
<i>&gt;light, belief in the effectiveness of NLP is a boon to the practitioner,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and disbelief is a detriment.  This is essentially a manifestation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the placebo affect: those who firmly believe in the cure are cured,</i><br>
<i>&gt;those who do not are not.</i><br>
<p>
I would think otherwise.  It could be placebo, but it could be more<br>
if actual "permanent" change is had.<br>
