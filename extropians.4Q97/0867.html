<i>&gt;In an e-mail conversation with my micro-economics teaching assistant, we</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;got onto the subject of the inefficiencies of government as a monopolistic</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;firm.  I am in no way experienced enough to have a sufficiently informed</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;debate on this topic-- could someone more learned please help me poke some</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;holes in his argument(although some points of his are very convincing).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Especially, how do I argue against his statement that public healthcare is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;40% cheaper than private!?!</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Note that Canada offers the same level of healthcare as</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the US but at about 40% lower costs.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Countries like Canada and Britain save so much money partially because<br>
<p>
the cash cow of privatized health care in the US finances the lion's share of<br>
<p>
development of new pharmaceuticals and techniques, which then benefit<br>
<p>
public health care systems worldwide.<br>
<p>
<p>
I read an article a year or three ago that asserted that wealthy Canadians<br>
<p>
were happy to use public health care for MOST things, but that when they<br>
<p>
needed a cutting-edge technique, or an especially skilled surgeon, they quite<br>
<p>
commonly flew down to America and paid cash. <br>
<p>
<p>
In general, health care you pay for is better than health care through the<br>
<p>
state.  Even the current near-equivilance of quality of care between countries<br>
<p>
like Canada and the US is only possible because the R&amp;D burden is unevenly<br>
<p>
carried by the US.  If all health care systems were public, the quality<br>
<p>
of healthcare worldwide would decrease.<br>
