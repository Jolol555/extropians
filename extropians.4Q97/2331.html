Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt; quotes:<br>

<p>
This is the crucial bit of (disappointing) information.  I looked<br>
carefully into this when the idea was originally annoucned, and decided<br>
that "teleportation" was definitely the wrong word.  It is *not*<br>
teleportation in any sense whatsoever.  It is the merely the ability to<br>
transfer the exact quantum state of one particle to an identical<br>
particle.  The second particle has to exist at the destination; the<br>
only thing that is transfered is the quantum state.<br>
<p>
It is almost certain that the quantum state of a normal, everyday object<br>
(like a brick, or a human) is completely irrelevant when it comes to<br>
true teleportation.  For example, the exact quantum state of the atoms<br>
inside the neurons in our head is almost certainly irrelevant to our<br>
consciousness.  This is why people can put their heads into MRI scanners,<br>
and nobody has ever come out of one as a vegetable, an axe murderer,<br>
or anything other than a little bit peckish.<br>
<p>
So, unfortunately, it's not teleportation at all, and the guy who<br>
decided to use that term for this effect should be shot for trying<br>
to make the effect look like so much more than it actually is.<br>
