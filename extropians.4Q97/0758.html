In a message dated 97-10-24 04:01:01 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Fleischman, but they can't claim that it's cold fusion because the<br>
 patent office has banned the use of the phrase &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
why is that? <br>
<p>
Also, I dunno why, but I missed all the posts on headless frogs, could<br>
someone send me them, or refer me to the list archives url?<br>
<p>
thanks<br>
