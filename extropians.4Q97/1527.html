	Twink &lt;neptune@mars.superlink.net&gt; brought up the great topic<br>
of "uplifting"!<br>
<p>
	Did you coin this usage of this term or has it been used<br>
before in this way?<br>
<p>
	I look forward to introducing my Dog to what it is like to<br>
have richer color vision and the joys of greater intelligence...  And<br>
I also look forward to knowing what it is like to hear, smell and be<br>
like a Dog...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree, though the tests for sentience is a whole topic in itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And a very important one I admit.:)</i><br>
<p>
	Yes.  It also surely isn't a hard line which on one side<br>
animals are sentient and on the other they are not.  It's a very<br>
broad, gradual and complex continuum.  I'm sure echo-locating animals<br>
such as bats and other animals, especially the higher ones mentioned<br>
here like whales..., have sensations humans have never felt.  In these<br>
particular areas they would be "more sentient" than we are.  "What is<br>
it like to be a bat?" is the famous question by Nagal.  What is it<br>
like to be a fish with a hook in it's mouth?  Does a fish feel pain<br>
the same way we do or does its body just twitch and flex the way an<br>
unfeeling machine might?  It's probably neather of these but something<br>
phenomenally different and we just don't yet know just what it IS<br>
like.<br>
<p>
	Until we can truly understand what and why phenomenal<br>
sensations are, and can do things like objectively observe and eff<br>
such feelings, we can't really accurately judge what is sentient and<br>
what is not.  Do single celled animals have any such phenomenal<br>
feelings or conscious knowledge?  I doubt it and would guess that<br>
these are mostly simply mechanical.  What about insects?  Are they<br>
purely abstractly mechanical or do they, too, experience some kind of<br>
phenomenal feeling representations?  Where is the line drawn between<br>
what can feel and what can't?  Until we know just what sensations are<br>
and how they are employed by the various intelligent animals to<br>
represent different kinds of knowledge and awareness, we can't yet<br>
really know where to draw the line between what is and what isn't<br>
sentient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Play God!</i><br>
<p>
	Yes definitely!  But shouldn't we be sure we are a good and<br>
benevolent God?  I don't think we should ever only "uplift" to a<br>
limited degree so that lower life forms can be left as such to only be<br>
our slaves or servants or whatever.  There will be plenty of ways for<br>
us all to do things mechanically without having to employ lessor<br>
sentient life forms to do slave labor.  If we have the right to be<br>
uplifted via the help of other humans, I would think most lower<br>
animals would deserve the same right.  The difference between a dog<br>
and us is nothing compared to the difference between us and a God<br>
right?<br>
<p>
	I look forward to being more sentient, and knowing what it is<br>
like to be a bat, a dolphin playing in wakes, eagles soaring through<br>
the Mountains... and to be God creating worlds and uplifting others<br>
and experiencing things no animal has yet experienced...  and I look<br>
forward to equally sharing these sensations, feelings, and phenomenal<br>
conscious knowledge and abilities with everyone and everything...<br>
<p>
	It doesn't matter what you are.  What you can become is all<br>
that matters to me.<br>
