A year or so back, there was a flurry here about Hugo de Garis's announced<br>
plans to build a Brain in Japan, using evolvable hardware.  I just checked<br>
in to his site to learn whether he'd maintained his announced schedule.<br>
Here's what he says:<br>
<p>
`I head the Brain Builder Group at ATR, a research lab in Kyoto, Japan. I<br>
expect, with the help of my group and international collaborators (from 9<br>
countries), to build an artificial brain with a billion artificial neurons,<br>
with evolved cellular automata (CA) based neural circuits, by the year<br>
2001. We already have 10 million neurons, and expect to achieve our target<br>
on time. By evolving neural  et modules with roughly 100 neurons each, at<br>
ELECTRONIC SPEEDS (i.e. a complete run of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), with<br>
tens of thousands of circuit growths and hardware-compiled fitness<br>
evaluations, all in less than a second) in special FPGA (Xilinx's XC6264<br>
chip) based evolvable hardware (called a CAM-Brain Machine (CBM)), we will<br>
be able to download these CA based neural circuit modules (each with its<br>
own evolved user specified function)  to user specified brain architectures<br>
embedded in a RAM based space of trillions of CA cells. The same CBM<br>
(programmable) hardware then updates the whole RAM CA space frequently<br>
enough (e.g. 2500 times a second, i.e. at over 100 BILLION CA cells a<br>
second) for real time operation. By the end of 1998, our Brain Builder<br>
Group (BBG) expects to see the completion of 2 parallel tasks,  amely the<br>
design and fabrication of the CBM (which was started in January 1997, and<br>
should be completed by the summer of 1998), and the creation of a 10,000<br>
module artificial brain architecture to control a robot kitten's many<br>
behaviors. Starting in April 1998, the construction of a robot kitten<br>
called "ROBOKONEKO" (in Japanese), should begin, and be completed by April<br>
1999. The 10,000 modules for the artificial brain will be evolved in 1998<br>
and 1999 with the CBM, and placed in the large RAM memory. The I/O between<br>
the RAM brain will link via radio antenna with the (life sized) kitten<br>
robot. After 2000, the BBG hopes to work on more ambitious projects, such<br>
as household cleaner robots, and with substantially more brain builder<br>
researchers on the team. (One of my goals for Japan is to see the country<br>
create a "J-Brain Project" (J = Japanese), which would aim to build a<br>
10,000,000 module artificial brain with 2000 human "EEs" (Evolutionary<br>
Engineers) over the time period 2001-2005). The basic strategy will be to<br>
increase the size of the artificial brain (both in terms of the number of<br>
modules it contains, and the number of EEs used to build it) by a factor of<br>
10 every 2 years, i.e. 1999-2000 (100,000 modules, 20 EEs), 2001-2002<br>
(1,000,000 modules, 200 EEs), 2003-2005 (10,000,000 modules, 2000 EEs). 20<br>
years from now, brain-like computers should generate a trillion dollar<br>
industry. My boss has a similar dream, hoping to see a ten billion<br>
(roughly the number of neurons in a human brain) neuron artificial brain be<br>
built by Japan over the period 2000-2010, in a large Japanese R&amp;D project.'<br>
