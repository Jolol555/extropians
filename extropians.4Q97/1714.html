Actually, they are found all over the place.  If they were only in the cold<br>
parts of<br>
the Pacific, how did they wind up in Mediterranean cuisine?  It is the giant<br>
octopus which is native to the _Northeast_ Pacific.  Though this organism has<br>
lots of potential, I think due to problems with handling and feeding it<br>
(octopodes<br>
of most types are big eaters, probably because of their active lifestyle),<br>
it would<br>
not be a good candidate for uplifting.  I am more inclined toward the brown<br>
octopus, which is found on both American coasts, is much smaller, more studied <br>
and more common.<br>

I don't completely understand your molluscaphobia:), but I can just as easily<br>
think of uplifting mammals being a threat.  But right now, the most dangerous<br>
mammals for you and me are humans.  I am more likely to be killed or injured<br>
by a human, either intentionally or otherwise, then I am by any mollusc or<br>
other organism, save microrganisms.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't think intelligence plus nonhuman form equals enemy of humanity.<br>
If so, what will posthumans be?<br>
