I have to disagree with you at least on the economics part. Before<br>
we get to a singularity caused by nanotech or powerful enough<br>
computers for human-level AI there will be major economic changes<br>
due to the increasing cheapness of computing power and bandwidth.<br>
These changes result in what Wired calls a "Network Economy" (see<br>
Wired 5.09, "New Rules for the New Economy"); we already live in<br>
the beginnings of this, everything on the net is part of it. Article<br>
is here: <a href="http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html">http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html</a><br>
It makes some interesting points, especially the idea that most<br>
if not all commodities in our world are dipping towards being free.<br>
Anything from a CD player to a modem to a stock quote online gets<br>
cheaper. In the coming years your phone line will dip towards free<br>
as they offer you better stuff(xDSL) for $$$. Reading and becoming<br>
familiar with these ideas can give you a powerful edge- for me,<br>
reading it triggered an idea for a new net-based business that<br>
is starting up on Monday!<br>
<p>
As for politics, I can tell you from my experience that since I<br>
ran into the net 4 years ago it has significantly changed _me_.<br>
I think that over the next 25 years or so as the majority of<br>
the planet gains net access (hopefully) there is the potential<br>
for something to happen.<br>
