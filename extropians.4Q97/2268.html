<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   ENERGY, THE MASTER RESOURCE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Energy is the master resource, because energy enables us to </i><br>
<i>&gt;convert one material into another. As natural scientists continue </i><br>
<i>&gt;to learn more about the transformation of materials from one form </i><br>
<i>&gt;to another with the aid of energy, energy will be even more </i><br>
<i>&gt;important. Therefore, if the cost of usable energy is low enough, </i><br>
<i>&gt;all other important resources can be made plentiful, as H. E. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Goeller and A. M. Weinberg showed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   For example, low energy costs would enable people to create </i><br>
<i>&gt;enormous quantities of useful land. The cost of energy is the prime </i><br>
<i>&gt;reason that water desalination now is too expensive for general </i><br>
<i>&gt;use; reduction in energy cost would make water desalination </i><br>
<i>&gt;feasible, and irrigated farming would follow in many areas that are </i><br>
<i>&gt;now deserts. And if energy were much cheaper, it would be feasible </i><br>
<i>&gt;to transport sweet water from areas of surplus to arid areas far </i><br>
<i>&gt;away. Another example: If energy costs were low enough, all kinds </i><br>
<i>&gt;of raw materials could be mined from the sea.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   On the other hand, if there were to be an absolute shortage of </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy - that is, if there were no oil in the tanks, no natural gas </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the pipelines, no coal to load onto the railroad cars - then the </i><br>
<i>&gt;entire economy would come to a halt. Or if energy were available </i><br>
<i>&gt;but only at a very high price, we would produce much smaller </i><br>
<i>&gt;amounts of most consumer goods and services.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The question before us is: What is the prospect for oil scarcity </i><br>
<i>&gt;and energy prices?  Here is the summary - at the beginning rather </i><br>
<i>&gt;than at the end of the chapter to provide guideposts for your foray </i><br>
<i>&gt;into the intellectual jungle of arguments about energy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (1) Energy is the most important of natural resources because</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       (a) the creation of other natural resources requires        </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy; and</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       (b) with enough energy all other resources can be created.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (2) The most reliable method of forecasting the future cost and </i><br>
<i>&gt;scarcity of energy is to extrapolate the historical trends of </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy costs, for reasons given in chapters 1 and 2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (3) The history of energy economics shows that, in spite of </i><br>
<i>&gt;troubling fears in each era of running out of whichever source of </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy was important at that time, energy has grown progressively </i><br>
<i>&gt;less scarce, as shown by long-run falling energy prices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (4) The cause of the increasing plenty in the supply of energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;has been the development of improved extraction processes and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;discovery of new sources and new types of energy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (5) These new developments have not been fortuitous, but rather </i><br>
<i>&gt;have been induced by increased demand caused in part by rising </i><br>
<i>&gt;population.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (6) For the very long run, there is nothing meaningfully </i><br>
<i>&gt;"finite" about our world that inevitably will cause energy, or even </i><br>
<i>&gt;oil in particular, to grow more scarce and costly. Theoretically, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the cost of energy could go either up or down in the very long run. </i><br>
<i>&gt;But the trends point to a lower cost.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (7) Forecasts based on technical analyses are less persuasive </i><br>
<i>&gt;than historical extrapolations of cost trends.  Furthermore, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;technical forecasts of future energy supplies differ markedly among </i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (8) A sure way to err in forecasting future supplies is to look </i><br>
<i>&gt;at current "known reserves" of oil, coal, and other fossil fuels.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (9) An appropriate technical forecast would be based on </i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering estimates of the amounts of additional energy that will </i><br>
<i>&gt;be produced at various price levels, and on predictions of new </i><br>
<i>&gt;discoveries and technological advances that will come about as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;result of various energy prices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (10) Some technical forecasters believe that even very much </i><br>
<i>&gt;higher prices will produce only small increases in our energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;supply, and even those only slowly. Others believe that at only </i><br>
<i>&gt;slightly higher prices vast additional supplies will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;forthcoming, and very quickly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (11) Causes of the disagreements among technical forecasters are </i><br>
<i>&gt;differences in</i><br>
<i>&gt;        (a) scientific data cited,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        (b) assessments of political forces,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        (c) ideology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        (d) belief or non-belief in "finiteness" as an element of</i><br>
         <br>
<i>&gt;the situation, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        (e) vividness of scientific imagination.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (12) The disagreement among technical forecasters makes the </i><br>
<i>&gt;economic extrapolation of decreasing historical costs even more </i><br>
<i>&gt;compelling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Now let's fill in this outline.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Because energy plays so central a role, it is most </i><br>
<i>&gt;important that we think clearly about the way energy is </i><br>
<i>&gt;found and used. This is the common view:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Money in the bank, oil in the ground.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Easily spent, less easily found.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The faster they're spent, the sooner they run out.                    </i><br>
<i>&gt;And that's what the Energy Crisis is about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But this jingle omits the key forces that completely alter the outcome. We</i><br>
shall see <br>
<i>&gt;that, with energy just as with other raw materials, a fuller analysis</i><br>
produces an <br>
<i>&gt;entirely different outlook than does this simplistic Malthusian projection.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The analysis of the supply of mineral resources in chapters 1-3</i><br>
identified four <br>
<i>&gt;factors as being important: (1) the increasing cost of extraction as more</i><br>
of the resource <br>
<i>&gt;is used, if all other conditions remain the same; (2) the tendency of</i><br>
engineers to <br>
<i>&gt;develop improved methods of extracting the resource in response to the</i><br>
rising price of <br>
<i>&gt;the resource; (3) the propensity for scientists and businesspeople to</i><br>
discover <br>
<i>&gt;substitutes - such as solar or nuclear power as substitutes for coal or</i><br>
oil - in response <br>
<i>&gt;to increasing demand; and (4) the increased use of recycled material.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The supply of energy is analogous to the supply of other "extracted"</i><br>
raw materials <br>
<i>&gt;with the exception of the fourth factor above.  Minerals such as iron and</i><br>
aluminum can be <br>
<i>&gt;recycled, whereas coal and oil are "burned up."  Of course this</i><br>
distinction is not <br>
<i>&gt;perfectly clear-cut; quarried marble is cut irreversibly and cannot be</i><br>
recycled by <br>
<i>&gt;melting, as copper can.  Yet even cut marble can be used again and again,</i><br>
whereas energy <br>
<i>&gt;sources cannot. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The practical implication of being "used up" as opposed to being</i><br>
recyclable is that an <br>
<i>&gt;increased rate of energy use would make the price of energy sources rise</i><br>
sharply, whereas <br>
<i>&gt;an increased use of iron would not affect iron prices so much because iron</i><br>
could be drawn <br>
<i>&gt;from previously used stocks such as dumps of old autos. This may seem to</i><br>
make the energy <br>
<i>&gt;future look grim. But before we proceed to the analysis itself, it is</i><br>
instructive to see <br>
<i>&gt;how energy "shortages" have frightened even the most intelligent of</i><br>
analysts for <br>
<i>&gt;centuries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The English Coal Scare</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   In 1865, W. Stanley Jevons, one of the last century's greatest social</i><br>
scientists, <br>
<i>&gt;wrote a careful, comprehensive book proving that the growth of England's</i><br>
industry must <br>
<i>&gt;soon grind to a halt due to exhaustion of England's coal. "It will appear</i><br>
that there is <br>
<i>&gt;no reasonable prospect of any relief from a future want of the main agent</i><br>
of industry," <br>
<i>&gt;he wrote. "We cannot long continue our present rate of progress. The first</i><br>
check for our <br>
<i>&gt;growing prosperity, however, must render our population excessive". Figure</i><br>
11-1 <br>
<i>&gt;reproduces the frontispiece from Jevons's book, "showing the impossibility</i><br>
of a long <br>
<i>&gt;continuance of progress." And Jevons's investigation proved to him that</i><br>
there was no <br>
<i>&gt;chance that oil would eventually solve England's problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fig 11-1 from Jevons</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   What happened? Because of the perceived future need for coal and</i><br>
because of the <br>
<i>&gt;potential profit in meeting that need, prospectors searched out new</i><br>
deposits of coal, <br>
<i>&gt;inventors discovered better ways to get coal out of the earth, and</i><br>
transportation <br>
<i>&gt;engineers developed cheaper ways to move the coal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   This happened in the United States, too.  At present, the proven U.S.</i><br>
reserves of coal <br>
<i>&gt;are enough to supply a level of use far higher than the present</i><br>
consumption for many <br>
<i>&gt;hundreds or thousands of years.  And in some countries the use of coal</i><br>
must even be <br>
<i>&gt;subsidized because though the labor cost per unit of coal output has been</i><br>
falling, the <br>
<i>&gt;cost of other fuels has dropped even more. This suggests that not enough</i><br>
coal was mined <br>
<i>&gt;in the past, rather than that the future was unfairly exploited in earlier</i><br>
years.  As to <br>
<i>&gt;Jevons's poor old England, this is its present energy situation: "Though</i><br>
Britain may <br>
<i>&gt;reach energy self-sufficiency late this year or early next, with its huge</i><br>
reserves of <br>
<i>&gt;North Sea oil and gas lasting well into the next century, the country is</i><br>
moving ahead <br>
<i>&gt;with an ambitious program to develop its even more plentiful coal reserves." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Long-Running Running Out of Oil Drama</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Just as with coal, running out of oil has long been a nightmare, as</i><br>
this brief history <br>
<i>&gt;shows: </i><br>
<i>&gt;     1885, U.S. Geological Survey: "Little or no chance for oil in</i><br>
California." <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     1891, U. S. Geological Survey: Same prophecy by USGS for Kansas and</i><br>
Texas as in 1885 <br>
<i>&gt;for California.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     1914, U. S. Bureau of Mines: Total future production limit of 5.7</i><br>
billion barrels, <br>
<i>&gt;perhaps 10 years supply.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     1939, Department of the Interior:  Reserves to last only 13 years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     1951, Department of the Oil and Gas Division:  Reserves to last 13</i><br>
years. <br>
<i>&gt;   The fact that the gloomy official prophesies of the past have regularly</i><br>
been proven <br>
<i>&gt;false does not prove that every future gloomy forecast about oil will be</i><br>
wrong.  And <br>
<i>&gt;forecasts can be overoptimistic, too.  But this history does show that</i><br>
expert forecasts <br>
<i>&gt;often have been far too pessimistic.  We therefore should not simply take</i><br>
such forecasts <br>
<i>&gt;at face value, because of the bad record as well as because they are</i><br>
founded on an <br>
<i>&gt;unsound method of proven reserves, as discussed in Chapter 2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;             THE LONG-RUN HISTORY OF ENERGY SUPPLIES</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The statistical history of energy supplies is a rise in plenty rather</i><br>
than in <br>
<i>&gt;scarcity. As was discussed at length in chapter 1, the relevant measures</i><br>
are the <br>
<i>&gt;production costs of energy as measured in time and money, and the price to</i><br>
the consumer.  <br>
<i>&gt;Figures 11-2, 11-3, and 11-4 show the historical data for coal, oil, and</i><br>
electricity.  <br>
<i>&gt;Because chapter 1 discussed the relationship of such cost and price data</i><br>
to the concepts <br>
<i>&gt;of scarcity and availability, that discussion need not be repeated here.</i><br>
Suffice it to <br>
<i>&gt;say that the appropriate interpretation of these data is that they show an</i><br>
unambiguous <br>
<i>&gt;trend toward lower cost and greater availability of energy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Figures 11-2a and b, 11-3a and b, 11-4a and b</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The price of oil fell because of technological advance, of course.  The</i><br>
price of a <br>
<i>&gt;barrel (42 gallons) fell from $4 to $0.35 in 1862 because of the</i><br>
innovation of drilling, <br>
<i>&gt;begun in Pennsylvania in 1859.  And the price of a gallon of kerosene fell</i><br>
from 58 cents <br>
<i>&gt;to 26 cents between 1865 and 1870 because of improvements in refining and</i><br>
transportation, <br>
<i>&gt;many of them by John D. Rockefeller.  This meant that the middle class</i><br>
could afford oil <br>
<i>&gt;lamps at night; earlier, only the rich could afford whale oil and candles,</i><br>
and all others <br>
<i>&gt;were unable to enjoy the benefits of light.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The price history of electricity is particularly revealing because it</i><br>
indicates the <br>
<i>&gt;price to the consumer, at home or at work. That is, the price of</i><br>
electricity is closer to <br>
<i>&gt;the price of the service we get from energy than are the prices of coal</i><br>
and oil, which <br>
<i>&gt;are raw materials. And as discussed in chapter 3, the costs of the</i><br>
services matter more <br>
<i>&gt;than the costs of the raw materials themselves. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The ratio of the price of electricity to the average wage in</i><br>
manufacturing (figure 11-<br>
<i>&gt;4a) shows that the quantity of electricity bought with an hour's wages has</i><br>
steadily <br>
<i>&gt;increased. Because each year an hour's work has bought more rather than</i><br>
less electricity, <br>
<i>&gt;this measure suggests that energy has become ever less troublesome in the</i><br>
economy over <br>
<i>&gt;the recorded period, no matter what the price of energy in current dollars. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   In short, the trends in energy costs and scarcity have been downward</i><br>
over the entire <br>
<i>&gt;period for which we have data. And such trends are usually the most</i><br>
reliable bases for <br>
<i>&gt;forecasts. From these data we may conclude with considerable confidence</i><br>
that energy will <br>
<i>&gt;be less costly and more available in the future than in the past. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The reason that the cost of energy has declined in the long run is the</i><br>
fundamental <br>
<i>&gt;process of 1) increased demand due to the growth of population and income,</i><br>
which raises <br>
<i>&gt;prices and hence constitutes opportunity to entrepreneurs and inventors;</i><br>
2) the search <br>
<i>&gt;for new ways of supplying the demand for energy; 3) the eventual discovery</i><br>
of methods <br>
<i>&gt;which leave us better off than if the original problem had not appeared.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   An early illustration of the process:  In 300 BCE, so much wood was</i><br>
being used for <br>
<i>&gt;metal smelting that the Roman Senate limited mining. (Using the coercive</i><br>
power of <br>
<i>&gt;government, instead of the creative power of the market, is a very old</i><br>
idea.   Almost two <br>
<i>&gt;millennia later, in England, the shortage of wood for use as charcoal in</i><br>
the casting of <br>
<i>&gt;iron became so acute - it was affecting the building of naval ships - that</i><br>
in 1588 <br>
<i>&gt;Parliament passed a law against cutting trees for coke in ironmaking, and</i><br>
then banned the <br>
<i>&gt;building of new foundries in 1580.   Though the use of coal in place of</i><br>
charcoal had been <br>
<i>&gt;known, there were technical difficulties - impurities that affected the</i><br>
quality of the <br>
<i>&gt;iron.   This time, the wood shortage exerted pressure that led to the</i><br>
development of coal <br>
<i>&gt;as well as blowing machines to be used in smelting, a keystone in the</i><br>
upcoming Industrial <br>
<i>&gt;Revolution. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;JUMPING OFF THE EIFFEL TOWER</i><br>
<i>&gt;   You may object that extrapolating a future from past trends of greater</i><br>
and greater <br>
<i>&gt;abundance is like extrapolating - just before you hit the ground - that a</i><br>
jump from the <br>
<i>&gt;top of the Eiffel Tower is an exhilarating experience. Please notice,</i><br>
however, that for a <br>
<i>&gt;jump from the tower we have advance knowledge that there would be a sudden</i><br>
discontinuity <br>
<i>&gt;when reaching the ground. In the case of energy and natural resources,</i><br>
there is no <br>
<i>&gt;persuasive advance evidence for a negative discontinuity; rather, the</i><br>
evidence points <br>
<i>&gt;toward positive discontinuities - nuclear fusion, solar energy, and</i><br>
discoveries of energy <br>
<i>&gt;sources that we now cannot conceive of.  Historical evidence further</i><br>
teaches us that such <br>
<i>&gt;worries about discontinuities have usually generated the very economic</i><br>
pressures that <br>
<i>&gt;have opened new frontiers. Hence there is no solid reason to think that we</i><br>
are about to <br>
<i>&gt;hit the ground after an energy jump as if from an Eiffel Tower. More</i><br>
likely, we are in a <br>
<i>&gt;rocket on the ground that has only been warming up until now and will take</i><br>
off sometime <br>
<i>&gt;soon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   More appropriate than the Eiffel Tower analogy is this joke:  Sam falls</i><br>
from a <br>
<i>&gt;building he is working on, but luckily has hold of a safety rope.</i><br>
Inexplicably he lets <br>
<i>&gt;go of the rope and hits the ground with a thud.  Upon regaining</i><br>
consciousness he is <br>
<i>&gt;asked:  "Why did you let go of the rope?"  "Ah", he says, "it was going to</i><br>
break anyway."  <br>
<i>&gt;Analogously, letting go of all the ropes that support the advance of</i><br>
civilization - for <br>
<i>&gt;example, turning our backs on the best potential sources of energy - is</i><br>
the advice we now <br>
<i>&gt;receive from energy doomsters and conservationists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;              THE THEORY OF FUTURE ENERGY SUPPLIES</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Turning now from trends to theory, we shall consider our energy future</i><br>
in two <br>
<i>&gt;theoretical contexts: (1) with income and population remaining much as</i><br>
they are now, (2) <br>
<i>&gt;with different rates of income growth than now. (The case of different</i><br>
rates of <br>
<i>&gt;population growth than now will be discussed in chapter 28.) It would be</i><br>
neatest to <br>
<i>&gt;discuss the U.S. separately from the world as a whole, but for convenience</i><br>
we shall go <br>
<i>&gt;back and forth. (The longer the time horizon, the more the discussion</i><br>
refers to the world <br>
<i>&gt;as a whole rather than just to the U.S. or the industrialized countries.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The analysis of energy resembles the analysis of natural resources and</i><br>
food, but <br>
<i>&gt;energy has special twists that require separate discussion. With these two</i><br>
exceptions, <br>
<i>&gt;everything said earlier about natural resources applies to energy: (1) On</i><br>
the negative <br>
<i>&gt;side, energy cannot easily be recycled. (But energy can come much closer</i><br>
to being <br>
<i>&gt;recycled than one ordinarily thinks. For example, because the fuel supply</i><br>
on warships is <br>
<i>&gt;very limited, heat from the boilers is passed around water pipes to</i><br>
extract additional <br>
<i>&gt;calories as it goes up the smokestack.) (2) On the positive side, our</i><br>
energy supplies <br>
<i>&gt;clearly are not bounded by the earth. The sun has been the ultimate source</i><br>
of all energy <br>
<i>&gt;other than nuclear. Therefore, though we cannot recycle energy as we can</i><br>
recycle <br>
<i>&gt;minerals, our supply of energy is clearly not limited by the earth's</i><br>
present contents, <br>
<i>&gt;and hence it is not "finite" in any sense at all - not even in the</i><br>
non-operational sense. <br>
<i>&gt;   Furthermore, humanity burned wood for thousands of years before</i><br>
arriving at coal, <br>
<i>&gt;burned coal about 300 years before developing oil, and burned oil about 70</i><br>
years before <br>
<i>&gt;inventing nuclear fission.  Is it reasonable and prudent to assume that</i><br>
sometime in the <br>
<i>&gt;next 7 billion years - or even 700 or 70 years - humanity will not arrive</i><br>
at a cheaper <br>
<i>&gt;and cleaner and more environmentally benign substitute for fission energy?</i><br>
<i>&gt;   But let us turn to a horizon relevant for social decisions - the next</i><br>
5, 25, 100, <br>
<i>&gt;perhaps 200 years. And let us confine ourselves to the practical question</i><br>
of what is <br>
<i>&gt;likely to happen to the cost of energy relative to other goods, and in</i><br>
proportion to our <br>
<i>&gt;total output.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;            THE BOGEYMAN OF DIMINISHING RETURNS AGAIN</i><br>
<i>&gt;   First let us dispose of the "law of diminishing returns" with respect</i><br>
to energy. Here <br>
<i>&gt;is how Barry Commoner uses this idea:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ... the law of diminishing returns [is] the major      reason why the</i><br>
United States <br>
<i>&gt;has turned to foreign      sources for most of its oil.  Each barrel [of</i><br>
oil]      drawn <br>
<i>&gt;from the earth causes the next one to be more        difficult to obtain.</i><br>
The economic <br>
<i>&gt;consequence is that           it causes the cost to increase continuously.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Another environmentalist explains her version of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;"law of diminishing returns" with respect to oil:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     We must now extract our raw materials from ever      more degraded</i><br>
and inaccessible <br>
<i>&gt;deposits. This means      that ever more of our society's precious</i><br>
investment      <br>
<i>&gt;capital must be diverted to this process and less is      available for</i><br>
consumption and <br>
<i>&gt;real growth. Fifty years      ago, getting oil required little more than</i><br>
sticking a      <br>
<i>&gt;pipe in the ground.  Now we must invest several billion      dollars to</i><br>
open up the <br>
<i>&gt;Alaska oilfields to deliver the      same product.  Economists, if they</i><br>
understood this      <br>
<i>&gt;process as well as physical scientists, might call it      the declining</i><br>
productivity of <br>
<i>&gt;capital [law of      diminishing returns].</i><br>
<i>&gt;   All these quotes are just plain wrong; it costs less today to get oil</i><br>
from the ground <br>
<i>&gt;in prime sources than it cost fifty years ago to get it from the ground in</i><br>
prime sources. <br>
<i>&gt;(The second afternote to chapter 3 explains how there is no "law" of</i><br>
diminishing returns <br>
<i>&gt;in general, and hence why this line of thinking is fallacious.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;   In brief, there is no compelling theoretical reason why we should</i><br>
eventually run out <br>
<i>&gt;of energy, or even why energy should be more scarce and costly in the</i><br>
future than it is <br>
<i>&gt;now. </i><br>
