<i>&gt; From: Brian Atkins [<a href="mailto:brian@posthuman.com">mailto:brian@posthuman.com</a>]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm wondering if it is possible for regular humans such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves to transcend these stupid genetic behaviors and</i><br>
<i>&gt; live more logical lives? Can it be done by strict self-</i><br>
<i>&gt; monitoring, or are there limits to how far we can progress?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any books written on this subject?</i><br>
<p>
To some extent, merely understanding these inate predelictions in<br>
yourself helps in counteracting them.  (Though I'd suggest that the<br>
majority of these are actually socially scripted, rather than<br>
genetically scripted.)  An excellent, extremely insightful book on our<br>
scripted behavior is Cialdini's _Influence_.  <br>
<p>
One technology that claims to allow humans to "rescript" themselves is<br>
Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).  A good book on NLP is "NLP: The New<br>
Technology of Achievment", by the NLP Comprehensive training team,<br>
edited by Steve Andreas.<br>
<p>
Caveat:  I've been experimenting with NLP on myself for the past few<br>
months, so my objectivity is quite possibly blurred.  However I must say<br>
that I find it both very interesting in the abstract, and very effective<br>
when put to use.  Most external measures of my well being and<br>
effectiveness (health, fitness, job performance, comments from friends &amp;<br>
associates, etc..) also seem to back up the positive effect it's had,<br>
though these positive effects may also be attributued to other factors.<br>
