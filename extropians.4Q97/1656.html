Since the topic of similar names was raised. I agree with T. O. Morrow<br>
that it is easy to confuse names. The most closely matching names I know<br>
of are the Extro conference series name and the Xtro series of movies.<br>
<p>
Xtro: (release 1982) A horror movie about an evil alien parasite that<br>
comes to Earth and causes havoc.  The advertising tag line was a comical<br>
contrasting reference to E.T.  "Not all extra-terrestrials are friendly." <br>
<p>
Two more films in the series were made.<br>
<p>
Xtro II: The Second Encounter: (release 1991)<br>
<p>
Xtro 3: Watch the Skies: (release 1995)<br>
<p>
I have not seen any of the movies.  Admittedly the topics covered in the<br>
conference and the movies are largely disjoint. Yet, Extro vs Xtro? Memes<br>
vs parasites? ;-)<br>
<p>
Seriously, it would be desirable for distinct transhumanist organizations<br>
to have distinctive dissimilar names.<br>
