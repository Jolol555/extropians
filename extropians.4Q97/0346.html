<i>&gt;We're back to the question: is this a clubhouse or an outreach group?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It's a clubhouse -- it's an outreach group -- it's two, two, two<br>
lists in one!  :-)<br>
<p>
Seriously, I think the most effective policy is "if you don't like it,<br>
don't reply to it".  It also saves a _lot_ of time.  Even writing a<br>
plonk message is a time-waster; what good does knowing you've plonked<br>
someone do anyone, including the plonkee?  It may only encourage them.<br>
To wit:  Memetic fitness is determined not by desirability, but by<br>
propagability.  Like a TV commercial, you can dislike it all you want,<br>
but it's done its job if you remember it (note my first line; apparently<br>
Certs did its job).  As a matter of fact, if it's obnoxious enough that<br>
you go around telling people how obnoxious it is, it's done even better<br>
("Hi kids!... Bye kids!").<br>
<p>
To stretch another analogy:  as I recall, an overactive immune response<br>
to invaders can also be detrimental to an organism.<br>
<p>
And another:  Let's be like a type of soil that undesirable seeds don't<br>
grow in.  Think about it -- what nourishes ideas?  Attention.  Any kind<br>
of attention. (analogy seque)  Like a child who's naughty because it<br>
gets em negative attention when no positive attention is forthcoming.<br>
<p>
Sigh.  Maybe I'm coming up with all these analogies because it's so<br>
clear to me that "you are an (idiot, immoral bastard, inconsiderate<br>
lout, etc.)" posts are counterproductive.  Man's email should exceed his<br>
time, or what's a D key for?  I suppose I also hope that a broad-<br>
spectrum vaccine will inoculate more list members.<br>
<p>
Live long and prosper,<br>
Kennita, who doesn't plonk anyone and still has time for Star Trek<br>
