Very true.  Quantum computation, for example, should have doubling qubits<br>
instead of doubling transistors.  So after 10-12 years, the size of the RSA<br>
key crackable by a computer will double every two years (or something like<br>
that).  Nanotech should make a huge leap, followed by a few more huge leaps,<br>
and finally bottom out at something like a quadrillion times current speed. <br>
Combine the two and you have enough computing power to do, well, pretty much<br>
anything you damn well feel like.  You could simulate a centillion humans on a<br>
chip the size of a dust speck, and do a thousand aeons of subjective time<br>
every second.<br>
<p>
So at this point, I don't care in the slightest what kind of S curve these<br>
technologies follow or even if they do follow an S curve, because this is<br>
enough computing power to warp the Universe.  We are talking *way* beyond<br>
what's necessary for Singularity.  Just simulate random object code until you<br>
get a Power.<br>
<p>
And quantum nanotech isn't even the fastest chip we can build, using the<br>
modern laws of physics.  I can think of two different ways, using current<br>
technology, to build chips that operate at infinite speeds - no infinite<br>
temperatures, no baby Universes.  The more speculative method wouldn't even<br>
cost more than a couple of megabucks, since you wouldn't need the space probe<br>
and the particle accelerator.<br>
