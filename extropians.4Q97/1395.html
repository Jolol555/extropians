<p>
Of course I have.  I wouldn't have made a statement about price<br>
comparisons if I hadn't actually compared prices.  I have recently<br>
purchased six PC's, 3 Macs, and 2 Unix Workstations for my home lab.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What do you mean "another products data files"? DO you mean that it made</i><br>

<i>&gt; merely a matter of file format association.</i><br>
<p>
No, I mean the installer opened up private preferences files for other <br>
non-Microsoft products that were previously installed on the computer<br>
and changed the data in those files such that the original applications<br>
couldn't use their own files any more.  Internet Config is a seperate<br>
product for configuring IP on the Mac.  No other product is supposed to<br>
write to those files, although the product will feed information from<br>
those files to other applications.  By changing the data formats in this<br>
file, Microsoft caused competing products to start failing with<br>
corrupted data while Microsoft products continue to work with the new<br>
format.  Restoring the Internet Config file from backup reenables the<br>
other products to their original functionality.<br>

<i>&gt; Here's an idea. Netscape could, GASP, do the same thing, impersonate an</i><br>
<i>&gt; Explorer browser to gain access to a MS webserver.... Gee why didn't I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think of that... I dunno, it must be because I don't work for</i><br>
<i>&gt; microsoft.....</i><br>
<p>
Sure they could do the same thing.  But as a Network Security<br>
consultant, I take a dim view of software deliberately providing false<br>
information to queries in an attempt to access server areas that the<br>
server administrator is clearly trying to withhold from that software. <br>
Just as any hacker caught trying to get in under false pretenses could<br>
be banned from the site, any software that lies to try to bypass<br>
security under false pretenses could also be banned.<br>
<p>
Of course my preferred solution is that my clients beef up their own<br>
security the way they want, and then they don't have to worry about what<br>
client do to try to break in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; There also are many examples of Microsoft products opening back doors on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; machines to allow their servers to gain access, or for their anti-piracy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; software to check for stolen products on your machine.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd like to see more about this. Any system administrator would find</i><br>
<i>&gt; this a useful tool, and this data must be how many of the network</i><br>
<i>&gt; oversight applications operate. A good way to make sure your coders and</i><br>
<i>&gt; data entry weenies are working and not playing solitaire or sending each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other joke email....I'm sure my boss would like to have that capability</i><br>
<i>&gt; over me... he he...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it would be a wonderful tool if it were documented and if the<br>
Network Administrators had access to this data.  Instead, it is<br>
undocumented, and only Microsoft software uses this information to<br>
gather data about someone else's network without their knowledge.<br>
<p>
Any knowledgeable network engineer can analyze these interactions with a<br>
sniffer and write their own code to access the same listening ports<br>
(backdoors) to gather information about PCs.  For each PC, you could<br>
tell what time an application started and what time it ended.  You could<br>
even choose to deny any specific (Microsoft) application by telling it<br>
that its copy is illegal.  The Microsoft product will override the local<br>
user's desire with the directives received over the network.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As a network consultant, I recommend that others in the field find out</i><br>
<i>&gt; more about how PCs work in background operations to expand their</i><br>
<i>&gt; horizons past their Mac blindered knowledge...</i><br>
<p>
I have discovered this stuff using packet sniffer tools to detect<br>
anomolous behaviors occurring in the background of most software vendors<br>
products.  Much of my research has been part of top secret DoD projects,<br>
for which I was specifically brought in because of my investigations<br>
into backdoors deliberately created by software vendors.  None of my<br>
research is second-hand or unsubstantiated.  (Long-time readers of this<br>
list will remember when I left the Government arena to found my own<br>
company in 1994.)  Besides consulting for DoD security projects, I also<br>
pull six figures per year from IBM for researching their PC networking<br>
difficulties.  I assure you that my knowledge of PC networking is not<br>
slight or biased.<br>
<p>
But why argue with me?  Anybody can buy the products, and then reverse<br>
engineer them to see what they are really doing in the background.  If<br>
you are a network consultant, you should probably have the tools to do<br>
this already.  Did you actually investigate any of these items before<br>
you decided to disagreed with them, or do you merely have the "faith"<br>
that Microsoft would never do anything underhanded with their software?<br>
