I have an incredibly simplistic view of the future: we either embrace<br>
technology, or we die. The reason is simple: population. There is no<br>
known non-technical way to stop the population from growing, so<br>
any attempt to freeze technology at or below its<br>
current level will result in the destruction of the earth's ecosystem<br>
in short order: 200 years max, probably less. This is a simple<br>
reducto-ad-absurdum argument for technological advancement, and<br>
IMO anyone who argues against technological advancement must<br>
first have a practial solution to the population problem.<br>
<p>
OK, given that technological advancement is the only alternative to<br>
the destruction of both humanity and the planetary ecosystem, we<br>
are now left with arguments about the nature of the technological<br>
change. Again, I feel that there is really not much we can do to<br>
guide the advance. Technological change in this era is driven by<br>
software, and software development is now very distributed and<br>
uncontrollable. This means that arguments about the moral and<br>
ethical aspects of technological change are interesting, but<br>
have no practical point, since the change is uncontrollable.<br>
<p>
Yes, there are a great many plausable scenarios in which technlogical<br>
change has detremental effects, but it's the only game in town. Live<br>
with it. IMO, the only way an individual can affect the change is<br>
to try to introduce and advance useful, non-detremental changes<br>
as fast as possible, while analyzing and warning against possible<br>
detremental effects. Given the historically accelerating rate of<br>
change, I feel that any atempt to make non-technical changes to<br>
society (i.e., a new ethic, a new religion, a new educational system,<br>
a new form of government) will take too long to have an important<br>
effect on technological change: by the time such a slow-acting change<br>
can have an impact (order 25 years) technology will have<br>
changed society beyond all recognition.<br>
