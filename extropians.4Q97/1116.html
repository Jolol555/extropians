: &gt;      &gt;The velocity of light is (approximately) constant at 'c',<br>

Tony Hollick writes<br>
:        [1] A photon is absorbed and emitted by electrons as it passes<br>
:        through a glass block.  The photon is decelerated, held, then<br>
:        re-emitted. Unless you believe that instantaneous transition from<br>
:        rest to 'c' is possible, the photon _must_ travel at intermediate<br>
:        velocities.<br>
<p>
Absorbed and emitted, fine.  Decelerated, baloney.<br>
It's not the same photon!<br>
<p>
<p>
: &gt;      &gt;but only _relative to the emitting charge_.<br>
:<br>
: &gt; Relative to anything.<br>
:<br>
:       Obviously absurd.  Relative to an adjacent photon in a coherent<br>
:       laser beam?<br>
<p>
Meaningless, since to a photon there's no distance or passage of time.<br>
<p>
:       Or a parallel 'near-luminal' electron beam?  C'mon...<br>
<p>
Yes - ever bother to learn how to to add/subtract relativistic velocities?<br>
Given two objects moving at velocities u,v (in the same direction),<br>
each one sees the other moving at<br>
<i>	|u-v| / (1-uv/cc);</i><br>
if u=c, then the other object sees the photons moving at<br>
	(c-v) / (1-v/c) = c (c-v)/(c-v) = c.<br>
The relative speed of two photons traveling together is<br>
	(c-c) / (1-cc/cc) = 0/0, undefined.<br>

Read "Einstein for Beginners".<br>

: &gt; The index of refraction is a measure of how much a substance will slow down<br>
: &gt; light, water is pretty dense so light is only about 80% as fast as in a<br>
: &gt; vacuum for example.<br>
:<br>
:       Notice the absurdity you're slipping into there.  Water<br>
:       (ferinstance) is tiny molecules enormously widely spaced.  The<br>
:       charges and neutrons are tiny particles enormously widely spaced.The<br>
:       space is a _perfect vacuum_ (except for the photons).<br>
<p>
Wrong.  The nuclei are vanishingly small, but the electron shells<br>
take up most of the volume.<br>
<p>
<p>
: &gt;       &gt;This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier<br>
: &gt;       &gt;et. al.) is the cause of the cosmic (Hubble) redshift, which is of<br>
: &gt;       &gt;course directly proportional to the distance stellar photons have to<br>
: &gt;       &gt;travel to get here.<br>
:<br>
: &gt; And now you enter the Twilight Zone. All elements produce a unique set<br>
: &gt; of emission and absorption lines in their electromagnetic spectrum, a<br>
: &gt; redshift means that the information on the  relative position of these<br>
: &gt; lines is preserved, they're just "shifted" to a longer wavelength. There<br>
: &gt; are only 2 things known to science that can produce a redshift:<br>
: &gt;<br>
: &gt; 1) The Doppler effect.<br>
: &gt;<br>
: &gt; 2) Gravity. (an effect discovered by Einstein by the way)<br>
:<br>
:       Never seen a sunset?  Filters?  etc. etc. etc...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
A filter is not a shift.  The light of a sunset is not shifted to red<br>
(as light from a receding star is): it's red because the blue is scattered<br>
out of it (to make the day sky blue).  What's left is the *same* red<br>
that forms part of the white light of day.<br>
<p>
By the way, if the speed of light depended on the emitting body,<br>
interferometer telescopes would not work.  They do.<br>
<p>

: &gt; and that car that runs on water.<br>
:<br>
:       Here's a little quiz:<br>
:       ".2 MeV protons shot into lithium-7 atoms at room temperature and<br>
:       pressure produce a fusion reaction ( Li7 --&gt; Be8 --&gt; 2 alpha<br>
:       particles ) releasing 17 MeV of surplus -- fusion --energy."<br>
:       True or false?  Wanna bet?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
I should know better than to ask, but - the relevance of this is ... ?<br>
<p>
<p>
: &gt; Like all scientific theories General Relativity does not cover<br>
: &gt; everything, it says nothing about the strong or weak nuclear forces,<br>
: &gt; Einstein spent the last 20 years of his life trying to extend it into<br>
: &gt; those areas and he failed, but that certainly doesn't mean General<br>
: &gt; Relativity is wrong.<br>
:<br>
:       &lt;Sigh&gt;.  Read Pais...<br>
:<br>
:       When Relational Mechanics is extendedf into the realm of the nucleus<br>
:       (as it will be), it will become the Third Revision, "Relational<br>
:       Dynamics."  Quantum Chromodynamics is densely packed with<br>
:       absurdities.  Busting up QCD will be great fun!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
Absurd, or counter-intuitive?  Is there any reason to expect<br>
the nuclear world, of which we can have no direct experience,<br>
to behave like the macro world which has shaped all our intuitions?<br>
<p>
: &gt;       &gt;An infinite Universe has nowhere to expand _into_. Right?<br>
:<br>
: &gt; Wrong.<br>
:<br>
:       Yeah?  Infinity into infinity = zero.<br>
<p>
Undefined, but zero is perhaps the least valid quotient.  Try it:<br>
	1 * oo = oo<br>
	2 * oo = oo<br>
	oo * oo = oo<br>
	0 * oo = ?<br>
