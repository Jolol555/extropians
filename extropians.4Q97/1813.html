<i>&gt; What Brent is talking about is allegorised by David Chalmers in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fading Qualia model (which, as I recall, that metaphysical dualist</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather surprisingly declines to accept).</i><br>
<p>
	I like a lot of Chalmer's stuff but I don't like the usage of<br>
"Fading" for something like this.  This phenomenal stuff isn't<br>
something that fades.  When something is in you conscious visual<br>
awareness it is definitely there, and when the neurons start failing<br>
to fire, it clearly goes away, is switched off, and you then have a<br>
blind spot in your awareness.  You either see red or you don't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Brent's opinion is an act of faith (as, of course, is James's and</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine to the contrary), and I guess we'll have to wait for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; GregEganist experiment to learn which turns out to be the case.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; I judge that James's position is more firmly consistent with</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything else we already know about the material world.</i><br>
<p>
	I think it is much more than an "act of faith" if you just<br>
think about it properly.  Our brain has evolved in a way that makes us<br>
think that color qualia are things that exist beyond our eyes, when in<br>
reality they are in our brain simply representing what is beyond our<br>
eyes.  It is "common sense" to think that 700 nm radiation has a "red"<br>
quality to it but this is completely wrong.  All we know about 700 nm<br>
radiation is it's causal properties and how we "abstractly" represent<br>
such causal properties with phenomenal red.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surely Brent would allow a single atom to be replaced, or a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; molecule (since, after all, this is always happening).</i><br>
<p>
	Only because actual atoms, though different, would probably<br>
have the same phenomenal qualities resulting in identical conscious<br>
sensations.  It may be that other physical things like electromagnetic<br>
radiation have phenomenal qualities that we simply haven't yet known<br>
how to look for since all we're looking for is causal properties and<br>
not actual fundamental qualities.  Evolution has learned how to<br>
harness such phenomenal qualities to represent information in our<br>
consciousness producing our very powerful intelligence and awareness.<br>
We must know this more than we know that there is a real physical<br>
world beyond our eyes.  We know absolutely that we are conscious, we<br>
can only infer that there is a real world beyond the cause and effect<br>
process that our eyes use to see.  We know absolutely what red is<br>
like, we can only abstractly infer what 700nm light's causal<br>
properties are and only abstractly represent them with phenomenal red<br>
in our brain.  We don't really yet know what light is fundamentally<br>
like.<br>
<p>
	Many of you seem to be claiming that we know everything about<br>
neurons and how they work, to the point that we can simulate<br>
everything that goes on.  But I completely disagree with this.  Sure<br>
we can track the red light, representing the strawberry, landing on<br>
our retina, through the optic nerve, to specific locations in our<br>
visual cortex.  Sure we can see what causes our muscles to move our<br>
hand towards that strawberry, and trace this cause back to the brain.<br>
But, in between these two we don't yet have any idea what is going on.<br>
We are still learning much about all the electro chemical processes<br>
involved and there is still much we do not know.<br>
<p>
	The important thing is to get over the "common sense" lie,<br>
evolution has taught us, thinking that red is something out beyond our<br>
eyes that we already know about.  It is not!  Red is something in our<br>
brain that we don't yet objectively know anything about.  It isn't<br>
light, it only abstractly represents light.  There is more to this<br>
world than the causal properties we only abstractly know about.  There<br>
are also phenomenal qualities.  Because we are only aware of these<br>
phenomenal properties inside our brain, we haven't yet learned how to<br>
properly look for them.  Once we start looking for more than causal<br>
properties, and realize that phenomenal qualites are something very<br>
real, and intelligently powerful, and that they really exist in our<br>
brain, we will finally be able to properly look for them and only<br>
thereby discover and understand them.<br>
<p>
	As long as we think there are some unexplicable, non existent<br>
thing that some how abstractly "arises from" "hypercomplex<br>
relatedness" in some incomprehensible way or that red is something<br>
beyond our eyes, we will never discover what things fundamentally are<br>
really phenomenally like.  In order to find consciousness, we must<br>
start looking in the right place and accept the fact that it is built<br>
out of something fundamentally and phenomenally real and<br>
understandable.<br>
