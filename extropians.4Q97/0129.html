[In response to Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<p>
Bill Gates and Microsoft have been known to commit illegal acts.  I'm not<br>
talking about antitrust, but about acts which would remain illegal under a<br>
Libertarian government... although, since I believe you support abolishment of<br>
patents and copyright laws, you might not see it that way.  (IMHO, this<br>
constitutes the abolishment of private property on the informational level,<br>
and hence Communism as we move towards an information-based economy.)<br>
<p>
I'm not talking about the Macintosh business, which was all invented by Xerox<br>
anyway.  Pen Windows, for example, was stolen from GO computing; Microsoft<br>
Post-It will also run if you type "3M Post-It".  ("Damn, I knew we forget something.")<br>
<p>
To some extent, Microsoft's dominance derives from their illegal and unlawful<br>
theft of intellectual property.  Even if intellectual property should be<br>
abolished, as Lee advocates, Microsoft's competitors couldn't use Microsoft's<br>
intellectual property, and Microsoft was either stealing or using coercion so<br>
that only it had free access to intellectual property.  Unlawful, any way you<br>
look at it.<br>
<p>
I do not condemn or condone Bill Gates.  He is one of very few people that<br>
have fully realized an inalienable individual right that has become unpopular<br>
in modern times:  The right to exert decisive influence on the course of history.<br>
<p>
But it is possible that Microsoft's dominance continues because numerous small<br>
competitors, that should by right have replaced Microsoft in its niche,<br>
instead failed because Microsoft stole their software.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates is neither wholly good nor wholly evil.  He is a genius, and it is<br>
ultimately his intelligence and his will that powers all of Microsoft. <br>
Intelligence above all is power, as I believe I have said elsewhere, and it is<br>
possible that this near-unique fact of genius in control is what maintains<br>
Microsoft above all others.  Microsoft also goes out of its way to recruit<br>
geniuses regardless of their coding ability, in the wish to "train them up". <br>
This tremendous fund of brainpower may also go a long way towards powering Microsoft.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates has acted more than once to influence charitable issues he regards<br>
as important, such as educational quality.  He regards himself (or claims to)<br>
as someone who simply happens to be a steward of a large share of humanity's<br>
resources.  He has stated that he intends to give all of his wealth away<br>
before he dies.<br>
<p>
He has also acted unethically, at least in my judgement, in order to preserve<br>
Microsoft's preeminence.  He has stolen, lied, cheated, and blackmailed.  So,<br>
of course, have most of the other great men of our time; he was simply the<br>
most successful, and I doubt that he ever viewed himself as stepping outside<br>
the bounds of fair but utterly cutthroat competition.<br>
<p>
He's someone to be reckoned with in Silicon Valley and indeed the whole world.<br>
 He has taken on archetypical status, entered into the realm of legend.  He<br>
spends at least 10% of his time talking to the media.  He has power and even<br>
the sort of power that corrupts.  He has genius-level intelligence, but not<br>
necessarily all *kinds* of intelligence.  He's not a servant of any ideology. <br>
His "The Road Ahead" is as much a computerized failure of imagination as "To<br>
Renew America".  And he's human, and mortal, and fallible, and lacks any great<br>
ethical imperative to override his own self-interest.  He's very, very<br>
competitive.  He'd use nuclear weapons on his opponents and call it fair play,<br>
and in Silicon Valley, he may be right.  What matters to him is winning.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates once scored in the top ten in his state.  I scored second for the<br>
Midwest for the grade above mine.  I know full well that someday, we'll either<br>
be boon allies or blood enemies.  You'd better believe I'm studying him very carefully.<br>
