<p>
The mantle is less dense than the core primarily because it's made of<br>
different <br>
material.  The core is solid metal, mostly iron.  The mantle is rocks<br>
like silicates and carbonates.  Solid metal weighs quite a bit more those<br>
rocks.<br>
<p>
Moving material from the core to the mantle or vice versa wouldn't change its<br>
density. It would be the same stuff.  However, it would be nearly impossible<br>
because of the weight difference.  Since the stuff is molten (more or less)<br>
the iron would just sink right back to the bottom.<br>
