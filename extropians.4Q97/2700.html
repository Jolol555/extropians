<p>
I don't think Jefferson was talking about militaries, and neither<br>
are the people in this thread.  The "armed" in this thread clearly<br>
refers to average citizens.  In that sense, the US citizenry is<br>
far more heavily armed than any other (first-world) country I'm aware<br>
of.  Certainly there are plenty of people in Western Europe and Canada<br>
with guns, but the percentage is far lower than in the US, and the<br>
kinds of guns are generally different, too.  Fully automatic weapons<br>
are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the military), and I suspect<br>
the same is true for most of Western Europe.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[Canada] not to</i><br>
<i>&gt;mention armed citizens</i><br>
<p>
Hardly anybody in Canada (percentage-wise) owns a gun.  I can only<br>
think of one person, in all the people I know personally (including all<br>
the not-so-close acquantences of my family), who owns a gun --- a<br>
pistol.  I used to have many friends who had guns, but they were all<br>
people who were involved with the Canadian military.  (I used to be in<br>
the the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.  I was on the rifle team.  I was the<br>
top cadet marksman in southern Ontario.  It was fun, and some day I may<br>
buy a rifle, but it's not high on my priority list.  So, you see, I have<br>
nothing personally against guns, I'm just arguing your facts here.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;not to mention a rather large and</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely well armed neighbor to the south. If you think thats got</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing to do with it, you're only kidding yourself.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing to do with "it"?  What "it" are you refering to?<br>
<p>
If you mean that the reason some Canadians have guns is because the<br>
US has lots of guns, I disagree.  Most Canadians will name "guns" as<br>
one of the primary differences between Canadians and Americans.  The<br>
Canadians that *do* own guns would probably do so regardless of the<br>
armed-ness of the US.<br>
<p>
So, as I said, since it is clear to me that there exist countries<br>
today that are substantially unarmed and also free and peaceful, it is<br>
unclear that Jefferson's statement will be proved correct in the long<br>
term.<br>
