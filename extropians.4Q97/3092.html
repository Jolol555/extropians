<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Put politely, 'rudeness' is treating others how you think they deserve<br>
to be treated. 'politeness' is treating others to a best approximation<br>
of how you think they might like to be treated. Notice that there is a<br>
significant gap in between the two. Just because you can't be polite<br>
because your approximation of how another might like to be treated goes<br>
beyond the limits of your ego, pride, self respect, forebearance,<br>
whatever, does not mean that you therefore MUST be rude. Also note that<br>
I did not mention the precept of treating others as you would like to be<br>
treated.<br>
<p>
As to your question about circular logic, I can easily imagine a society<br>
where rudeness is socially acceptable. Its called America in the 90's.<br>
<p>
While I can easily see your point that excessive politeness can be a<br>
destructive force, I look at it as an equal and opposite destructive<br>
force as rudeness. Taken to an extreme, either is harmful to a society.<br>
<p>
Witness, as juxtapositions, Victorian England and 90's New York City.<br>
