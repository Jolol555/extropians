<i>&gt; wanted to remake the world so that the likes of me would be on top,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and all the idiots would know that in order to become successful they</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have to become like me. That would be a most fitting revenge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and quite constructive too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Such a strategy is the most successful one, of course, however, not all<br>
geniuses always make decisions based on their own rational long term<br>
interest. They ar of course, more likely to than the average cluck, but<br>
there is also the observed attendant higher odds of mental illness among<br>
the genius level population than the common 'danes. Constructing<br>
safeguards to test new uploads for mental stability are of course, in<br>
order, but who decides, and who watches the watchers???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Seriously, I think it is more rational and efficient to find ways to</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumvent or ignore the anti-tech/anti-intellectuals. Direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; confrontations are so silly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Reactionaries will of course be on the opposite side, forming</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; terrorist insurgencies to oppose the transition. Anyone who thinks the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transcendant period will not be violently dynamic is living in a fools</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; paradise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We discussed this at the Aleph dinner yesterday. One idea we came up</i><br>
<i>&gt; with in order to avoid strong reactionary forces is to make sure we</i><br>
<i>&gt; listen to dissidents, and make them an acknowledged part of our way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; planning. Despite their views, they sometimes have true things to say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and letting them argue their case makes some of the steam blow off,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which otherwise would have increased the pressure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

You guys are so lucky to live in such a homogenous country. Your ideas<br>
about political/cultural polarization are so quaint. SOrry to sound<br>
demeaning, but I recommend you read _Culture_Wars_. When there is<br>
political polarization, those who lead the sides tend to be radicals<br>
that push out voices of moderation. The longer it takes to come to<br>
political solution, the greater the polarization, the more shrill and<br>
uncompromizing the parties. Solutions usually take the form of reactions<br>
to atrocities enacted by an extremist. Usually opposite of what the<br>
extremist intended. The way to neutralize anti-techers is to frame<br>
extremist members of their groups in a plot to bomb some symbolic center<br>
of high tech, say, the first AI, or the Patent Office. I know it sounds<br>
darkly Machiavellian, but history shows that it works... Tell me, what<br>
do you think of Luddites when you think of Theodore Kazinski??? He's an<br>
excellent example of what we need to see more of. Marginalization by<br>
making them seem like they are all wackos. Its worked for anti-gun<br>
activists to to the same in PR against gun owners.<br>
