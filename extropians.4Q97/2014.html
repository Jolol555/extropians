<i>&gt; Actually we are about to make a change. To post to the</i><br>
Extropians list you will need to be a member of Extropy<br>
Institute, although non-members will be able to read only.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been too busy with getting the newsletter to post about</i><br>
this change, but now it's out I will explain the hows and whys,<br>
probably today.<br>

Hi People, that subject title happens to strike a deep<br>
chord in me, ... I'd move to suggest that some extropian posts<br>
did change my life ... I'm still sure that we've got a good thing<br>
going here,...<br>
<p>
We all could do better with a little more effort put<br>
into thinking about people who are on list ,... and been <br>
more sensitive and not resorting to 'flaming' down one another<br>
( an eye for an eye , makes the world go blind  - Gandhi )<br>
<p>
I think the guidelines and rules laid down at the beginning when<br>
we all first logged onto extroppians are well thought thru and we<br>
should strive to adhere to them ....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Apart from restricting the list, we are about to open several</i><br>
<i>&gt; special-purpose lists that will also be restricted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Look for details of both of these changes here.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's reassuring to know too,.. because we can't possibly<br>
get our hands on every thread we see , and I like the idea of<br>
people talking confidently about their field of exppertise ...<br>
doesn't everyone agree to that ? the ssnr would definitely improve<br>
and if one is not a member of that restricted list, one still can<br>
read but not write to it , right ?!<br>
<p>
Anyways, I'm optimistic about the future outcomes<br>
All this mess occurs because we're still humans<br>
not posthumans yet !!! hey hey hey<br>
<p>
===<br>
In astrophysics, the general strategy is to formulate mathemat-<br>
ical models of real systems, calculate quantitative predictions<br>
from these models, and then see if observations agree with these<br>
predictions. If there is agreement, then for the time being the<br>
model is considered a useful description of the system of<br>
interest, and conversely, its negation will warrant a correction<br>
or <br>
abandonment of the model. - Unattributed                         <br>
    <br>
While others may argue about whether the world ends <br>
with a bang or a whimper, I just want to make sure <br>
mine doesn't end with a whine. <br>
