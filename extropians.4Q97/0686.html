<i>&gt; This message is being circulated throughout the Internet, and I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; know where it originated, although it came with attachments coded in </i><br>
<i>&gt; html.  Can anyone render an opinion as to its possible veracity?  Can </i><br>
<i>&gt; cookies possibly be constructed to operate in this fashion?</i><br>
<p>
This has all the usual markings of a fraud, so I see little reason<br>
to take it seriously.  But to be honest, there's no reason that AOL<br>
couldn't design their software to do anything they wanted--after all,<br>
the user downloads a native-code browser, so there's no way he can<br>
limit what it does.  The use of the term "cookies" here is an<br>
obvious attempt to sound technical and play on paranoia about that<br>
harmless feature of standard browsers.  Nothing in the rest of this<br>
message bears any relation to them; what they are describing is called<br>
a "back door", and while they certainly could do it, getting caught<br>
at it would probably ruin a multi-billion dollar company, and even<br>
Steve Case isn't that stupid.<br>
<p>
Call it a hoax until they show some proof, like a code offset. Until<br>
then, I assume someone just wants to piss off AOL by starting a rumor.<br>
