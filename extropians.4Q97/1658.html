<i>&gt; From:          Twink &lt;neptune@mars.superlink.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was reading _Invertabrates_ by Brusca and Brusca, a very large and</i><br>
<i>&gt; good book which has a small but informative section on cephalopods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; last night.  It seems all cephalopods are carnivores.  This should not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be viewed as a problem, since so are many human pets (dogs, cats)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and one variant of humanity (Eskimoes).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The octopus has the largest brain of all the cephalopods and from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; diagrams and text (they did not give any numbers), its brain appears</i><br>
<i>&gt; much larger than a squid's.  The squid's brain does not even come</i><br>
<i>&gt; close -- more like comparing a human's brain to that of a mouse.</i><br>
<p>
Reading this, I have to ask: did they include the giant squid?  <br>
<p>
The Pacific giant octopus is basically on a human scale; the giant <br>
squid is HUGE, with tentacles known to exceed fifty feet in some <br>
cases.<br>
<p>
However, the giant squid is a deep-water creature, that has trouble <br>
tolerating the low pressures to be found near the surface of the <br>
ocean.  To the best of my knowledge, scientists have never managed to <br>
do any meaningful observation of one in its natural habitat or in <br>
good health.  What we know of them is from dead or near-dead ones, <br>
and fragments (which are usually sections of tentacle), that have <br>
floated to the surface and washed ashore or otherwise been spotted.<br>
<p>
(I personally think the giant squid is a bad choice for an uplift <br>
experiment.  But NOT because of small brains.  For one good reason, <br>
read the previous paragraph.  For another, what we DO know <br>
about them indicates that they are rather less than sociable.)<br>
