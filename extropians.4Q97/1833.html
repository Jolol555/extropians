  If I have a robot that feeds me grapes, why would I want<br>
<i>&gt;to suddenly go out and kill some backwards religious person that fears</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology?  It's absurd to think there would be a reson for such</i><br>
<i>&gt;right?</i><br>

<p>
Of course killing them is not the solution and would never be an admitted<br>
behaviour in an evoluted world. <br>
But a solution sometimes is necessary since such religious people<br>
generally get politically organized and simply say (and may even "win" at<br>
the end) that your robot<br>
 or human cloning, or anything else are "things of the devil"...and "against<br>
god's wish" ...<br>
Cause of such behaviour they are not so pretty good boys/girls...and we<br>
always must have a more intelligent<br>
(and stronger) response for them.<br>
