Anders,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The attributes of our selves are not relevant, what I was trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; model is personal experience of self.</i><br>
<p>
	Oh ok.  I guess I'm must trying to work through and figure out<br>
the details and significances of your models.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No. His self(me, myself) would evaluate to something. If this</i><br>
<i>&gt; dualist then realized the error of his ways he would become a</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly different person, and his self(me', myself') could evaluate</i><br>
<i>&gt; to something else (but likely he would think he had not become</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody different, just a bit more enlightened).</i><br>
<p>
	Hmmm, I guess I'm still struggling with what this erroneous<br>
self(me, myself) would be, other than a fantasy, and why it would be<br>
of any importance since it would have no relation to fundamental<br>
reality.  Sure we can have fantasies about what we are, but what I<br>
want to know is what is it, fundamentally, that such phenomenal<br>
fantasy is really made of or consciously represented by.  To me, what<br>
fantasies (and accurate precepts of reality) are really made of is the<br>
stuff of consciousness, and this stuff is what we fundamentally are.<br>
A computer that has similar behavior to you may have abstract models<br>
that represent information like your phenomenal conscious models do<br>
but an abstract binary number is nothing like a real phenomenal red<br>
sensation is it?  Regardless of whether this red is a dream of a<br>
fantasy cherry or accurately representing a real sumptuous juicy one<br>
you are about to eat, it is much more than an abstract number right?<br>
