In *any* history class, or in any history class taught by<br>
government employees?<br>

The classic debunking of this one is, I think, Henry Hazlitt's (not<br>
sure if it originated with him, might have come from Frederic<br>
Bastiat) story of the broken window.  It's a simple homily from<br>
economics, but if you understand it, then you understand what sort<br>
of effect war has on an economy.  Sorry I can't come up with a more<br>
specific reference (I did run a few web searches).<br>
<p>
If someone tried to foist this sort of propaganda off on a roomful<br>
of children while I was present, knowing what I (think I) know now<br>
and did not know when I was a child, I'd have a hard time controlling<br>
my temper, I think.<br>
