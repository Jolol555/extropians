<i>&gt; &gt;  Regardless of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; how grudgingly they may have felt about being locked in, or how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they lied to themselves about wanting reliable software (no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; really wants reliable software, they just think they do), the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is that they signed the checks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be an example of positive feedback: the more people have Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt; software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have &gt; compatible</i><br>
<i>&gt; software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)</i><br>
<p>
Logically, in order to break such domination you need to make the<br>
compatibility issue irrelevant. If people don't have to worry<br>
about compatibility, then competition becomes possible again and<br>
"lock-in" dies. The Internet/open standards movement is the<br>
way to solve the problem, and it _does_ solve the problem as<br>
long as everyone sticks to the standard (both providers and users).<br>
It falls apart the instant you use those "cool Netscape frames"<br>
that aren't part of the HTML standard. The same thing is happening<br>
with Java- Microsoft is slowly but surely corrupting it by adding<br>
Windows-only features that will entice developers to tie themselves<br>
(and the users of their software) to the Windows platform. It seems<br>
that even in "internet land", MS finds ways to lock people in. The<br>
only way to break the cycle is through personal diligence on the<br>
part of developers to reject MS and embrace true cross-platform<br>
solutions. And even then, that only takes care of the OS monopoly.<br>
They have a whole other monopoly on software, and curing that<br>
hasn't even begun yet (unless you count XML??).<br>
