"Michael M. Butler" &lt;butler@comp*lib.org&gt; and "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin"<br>
&lt;warrl@blarg.net&gt; make a good point: that in terms of labour expended<br>
to build the product, Linux is no more free than any other OS of<br>
similar complexity.  That is true, but I think they are confusing<br>
"price" with "cost".  I learned while working with a financial company<br>
a few years ago what the difference is: the cost of something is how<br>
much it, um, costs, to build it.  The price is what you have to pay<br>
to get it.<br>
<p>
With that distinction in mind, it becomes clear that the cost of Linux<br>
is just as high as other OS's of similar complexity, but the *price*<br>
varies considerably as a function of who you are.  If you are a Linux<br>
developer, then your price can be quite high, depending on the number<br>
of hours you spend developing.  However, if you are not a Linux<br>
developer, then the price is considerably lower.<br>

<p>
I hope this doesn't degrade into a religious "my OS is better than<br>
yours" war, but I'll try to answer your points objectively.  I am<br>
assuming that you are specifically referring Microsoft OS's.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;learning to use a more complex system</i><br>
<p>
If you don't need the power that Unix provides, then you are correct.<br>
However, the people who install Linux tend to be people who are already<br>
familiar with Unix, so the cost has already been incurred for other<br>
reasons.  Granted, the people who install Linux these days tend to be<br>
less "guru-like", but Linux has also kept up with becoming easier to<br>
use --- within the bounds of being Unix, of course.<br>
<p>
I would also argue that DOS and Windows are not always as "plug-and-play"<br>
as they advertise, and that fixing the problems that can occur can sometimes<br>
be just as costly and annoying as Linux can be.  If not for the owner, then<br>
for the entity that gets called in to fix it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sacrificing the productivity of lots of off-the-shelf software that's not</i><br>
<i>&gt;available</i><br>
<p>
A few years ago that may have been true, but it's not anymore, for two<br>
reasons.<br>
<p>
1) Linux is sufficiently popular that some commercial Unix suppliers are<br>
starting to produce Linux versions of their software.<br>
<p>
2) Linux is now capable of running DOS and Windows 95 programs.  I have<br>
not tried it, but a friend has run Wordperfect for Windows95, and MS<br>
Internet Explorer 4.0, under Linux, using the WINE pacakage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;increased cost in exchanging data with others</i><br>
<p>
How?  Linux can read and write DOS disks, communicate over the Internet<br>
as well as (ha! better) than DOS/Windows, read/write DOS partitions on<br>
a local hard drive...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Paying $100 to get an OS that won't incur those costs is a bargain.</i><br>
<p>
There's one more cost that a Linux user just can't resist mentioning:<br>
rebooting costs.  How often do you have to reboot your Windows 95 box,<br>
due to application errors?  The people who I talk to every day who<br>
run Windows around here say that it is uncommon to get through a day<br>
of heavy use without having to reboot at least once, with the encumbent<br>
loss of time and data.  Linux boxes routinely stay up for weeks or even<br>
MONTHS on end without ever crashing.<br>
