My 2 cents:<br>
<p>
Although I haven't read Robert Anton Wilson I like Max's list, but Eliezer is <br>
absolutely correct, "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas R. Hofstadter just has <br>
to be at the top of any Extropian reading list, it's a pure joy, the most <br>
brilliant book I've ever read and the only non fiction science book I thought<br>
deserved a Nobel Prize in literature. "Metamagical Themas", another book by <br>
Hofstadter is also excellent, as is "The Mind's I" which he wrote with Daniel <br>
Dennett.<br>
<p>
For an introduction to complexity theory and a little cellular automation <br>
read "The Recursive Universe" by William Poundstone.<br>
<p>
I really think that something by Raymond Smullyan is needed, "The Tao Is <br>
Silent" is his most accessible and probably the most accessible book on my <br>
list, certainly the funniest. That doesn't stop it from being a profound <br>
examination of eastern philosophy and modern logic. This book taught me that <br>
not all mystics are fools, just most of them.<br>
<p>
The best popular account of the weird world of Quantum Mechanics is <br>
"The Cosmic Code" by Heinz R Pagels, and for General Relativity "Black Holes <br>
and Time Warps" by Kip Thorne. David Deutsch's brand new book "The Fabric Of <br>
Reality" is the best explanation of the many worlds interpretation of Quantum<br>
Mechanics I've ever seen and it gives you a good dose of the Philosophy of <br>
Karl Popper too.<br>
<p>
For physical anthropology and the evolution on humans I would recommend <br>
"Lucy" by Donald Johanson. For earlier times and the start of multicellular <br>
life  I like "Wonderful Life" by Stephen Jay Gould. For even earlier history <br>
and the very beginning of life try "Origins" by Robert Shapiro. I loved <br>
Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" and "The Blind Watchmaker" but in many <br>
ways  "The Extended Phenotype" is his best book. <br>
 <br>
For somebody who knew nothing about science but wanted to learn you couldn't <br>
do better than "Asimov's New Guide To Science" and for those unfortunate <br>
people infected with the pseudo science meme (Danny, are you listening?)  <br>
Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World" (1) is a good antibiotic, so is <br>
"Fads and Fallacies In The Name Of Science" by Martin Gardner.<br>
  <br>
 (1) I "read" this book by listening to it on cassette tapes in my car, I've     <br>
     been doing this a lot lately and it's great! Instead of getting <br>
     frustrated when I get into a traffic jam I now find I don't mind a bit.<br>
