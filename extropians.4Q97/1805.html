Space Stock Surfers<br>
Mission Statement<br>
<p>
The Vision<br>
<p>
The Space Stock Surfers envision a day when human civilization reaches across<br>
the expanse of the Solar System, and all people are free to work, live, play,<br>
and associate with others, according to their own natures, with minimal<br>
interference from authoritative powers.  Energy will be free, cheap, and<br>
plentiful, supplied directly by the Sun through Solar Power Satellite<br>
systems, nuclear fusion, and other systems not yet developed, but that will<br>
be inspired by space development.  Trade will be free and open, between the<br>
planets and the multitude of intraplanetary settlements, and the economy of<br>
the entire human species will be assured of expanding and thriving, due to<br>
the influx of extraterrestrial resources.  This affluence will cause a<br>
renaissance in the human spirit, and the arts and culture will flourish in<br>
diverse and beautiful ways.  People will live in expectant hope for tomorrow,<br>
secure in the knowledge that, although life, liberty and happiness are not<br>
guaranteed, all will be able and allowed to choose their own destinies, and<br>
can strive as they see fit for the highest good. <br>
<p>
The Philosophy<br>
<p>
A necessary prerequisite for such a vision is the continuous, sustainable<br>
expansion of the global economy.  That is impossible with finite resources.<br>
 The Earth is completely explored; there are no more "new worlds" on this<br>
planetary surface.  The only way to increase the resource base is by<br>
off-world expansion.  This should be undertaken peacefully, with opportunity<br>
and benefit generated for all people of the Earth who wish to participate.<br>
 Even those who do not actively participate should benefit from the general<br>
expansion of the worldwide economy.<br>
<p>
The Mission<br>
<p>
To that end, the Space Stock Surfers have formed to invest in the companies<br>
that are actively creating the infrastructure and systems necessary to<br>
economically develop space and acquire the resources available there.  We<br>
believe that, in the very long term, but still within our lifetimes, space<br>
will be one of the most profitable and opportunity-producing endeavors of<br>
humanity.  We seek to invest in companies that are financially sound and<br>
thriving today, yet have set their sights on the technologies and ideas that<br>
will revolutionize our economy by bringing the benefits of space to Earth,<br>
and by opening space to Earth-dwellers.  This includes not only aerospace<br>
firms, but any companies with the vision to look past the limiting two<br>
dimensions of the surface of our planet.<br>
<p>
The Strategy<br>
<p>
The Space Stock Surfers is an investment club patterned after the National<br>
Association of Investors Corporation model.  We seek to make long term<br>
investments based on fundamental analysis, and we eschew market timing and<br>
other technical strategies.  We look for undervalued companies that are out<br>
of favor because of reactions to recent news by investors who think on a<br>
quarterly basis.  Whenever possible, we engage in dollar cost averaging,<br>
preferring to establish Diveidend Reinvestment Programs with the stocks we<br>
hold.  We are not limited to any size, age or temperament of companies.  Our<br>
portfolio contains a wide range of stocks, from Dow-Jones Industrial Average<br>
components to small companies that have recently gone public and have little<br>
or no earnings.  We believe in diversification for dilution of risk.<br>
 Therefore, not all of the companies in which we invest are necessarily<br>
engaged in space development.  The common thread throughout our investments<br>
is a long-term focus on value and sustainable growth, with an emphasis on<br>
developing new technologies that can lead to the opening of the space<br>
frontier.<br>
<p>
The Challenge<br>
<p>
We challenge all space enthusiasts and those interested in the long-term,<br>
sustainable growth and survival of our culture and species to follow our<br>
example.  If these ideas resonate within you, you can do it, too.  We are<br>
average people that live and work ordinary lives.  All it takes is a belief<br>
in yourself, a belief in the future, and an interest in how the economy and<br>
the markets work.  We are willing to help any individuals or groups that wish<br>
to form their own space stock clubs.  The challenges are great, but so are<br>
the opportunities and the rewards.  Join us in our quest, and someday, in the<br>
not-too-distant future, we can all meet in space to celebrate our successes.<br>
