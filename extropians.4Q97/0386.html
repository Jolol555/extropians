<i>&gt; Like formal religion, governmental systems come under a wide assortment of</i><br>

<i>&gt; there are surface differences in political form, and method of</i><br>
<i>&gt; implementation, but at the nitty gritty definitive radical level,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "government" is simply a synonymn for initiation of force and coercion. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; initiation of force and coercion may be politicized,organized, centralized,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and canonized, but the subjective labels and arbitrary claims do not erase</i><br>
<i>&gt; the root meaning of the term, nor the destruction that is certain to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; derived from the practice. One of the points that I'm trying to make here is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when I say the concept, objective morality, depends on the concept,</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior being, I am not saying that it will be highly visible, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognized by most, nor admitted for it may not be of a conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; designation. However, if we eliminate human individual as the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; "objective morality", what logically remains except a volitional, valuing</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that</i><br>
<i>&gt; something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external</i><br>
<i>&gt; "something" volitional thing to create an "objective morality?"</i><br>

<p>
I altered along the reality/morality analogy axis:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;In an alternate Universe, you wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; However, if we eliminate individual opinions as the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; "objective reality", what logically remains except the opinions of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; "something" opinionated thing to create an "objective reality?"</i><br>
<p>
And you complained:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First, I never wrote anything in "alternative Universe." I even reject the</i><br>
<i>&gt; phrase as a contradiction. The only thing I can find that even has a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; vague similarity by a line or two is this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; {{{{{Nevertheless, when we eliminate human</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual as reference for the concept, morality, what remains</i><br>
<i>&gt; except an expressed or implied superior being; indeed, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychological force does the concept, morality, have without</i><br>
<i>&gt; subordinating individual to an "external superior?"}}}}}</i><br>
<p>
Wrong.  My version was altered from yours almost verbatim, maintained most of<br>
the phrasing, and did not alter any meaning except substituting "reality" for "morality".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hardly a match, is it?  As you can see, what you're saying I wrote is quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bit removed from my actual statement. There are several instances of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your post and its most confusing. Sometimes a whole paragraph is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine, and sometimes there appears to be a mix. I have no idea what happened,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but considering the circumstance, I'll just respond to a major point or two.</i><br>
<p>
Please take a little more time to check what you said before accusing me of<br>
misquoting you.  I am not responsible if you forget what you say because<br>
you're making it up as you go along.<br>
<p>
Oh, and about this:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First, I never wrote anything in "alternative Universe." I even reject the</i><br>
<i>&gt; phrase as a contradiction.</i><br>
<p>
Right.  You reject the phrase as a contradiction, even though you know<br>
perfectly well what I'm talking about (alternate Universes a la "Lord Kalvan<br>
of Otherwhen" or "All the Myriad Ways" or two hundred other books), and even<br>
though counterfactual processes are built into the basic ontological substrate<br>
of reality (quantum mechanics; the Schrodinger equation and linear evolution).<br>
<p>
When it comes to morality, I couldn't have expressed the flaws in your<br>
objections more clearly.<br>
<p>
I am not debating with someone who mysteriously forgets what the term<br>
"objective morality" means after starting an attack on it.  There is a<br>
difference between analyzing a definition and pretending not to understand it.<br>
