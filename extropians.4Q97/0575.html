It seems that the many-minds interpretation applys not just to quantum<br>
mechanics, but to probability itself. Under this interpretation, the<br>
probability that a statement is true to someone is the fraction of minds<br>
in the same state as his that live in worlds where the statement is true.<br>
So when I say a coin has probability 1/2 of landing heads, I mean that<br>
half of me (or more precisely half of minds in the same state as mine)<br>
live in worlds where the coin will land heads.<br>
<p>
This interpretation offers a simple solution to the copying problem I gave<br>
a couple of weeks earlier. The central question in that problem was: after<br>
you wake up following a cloning operation that conditioned on a coin<br>
landing heads, what is the probability that the coin landed heads? Before<br>
you went to sleep, your probability of the coin landing heads was 1/2.<br>
This means half of you live in worlds where the coin will land heads, but<br>
since there is just one of you in each of those worlds, that implies the<br>
number of worlds where the coin lands heads as is the same as the number<br>
of worlds where the coin lands tails. After you wake up, the probability<br>
is 2/3 since 2/3 of you (which include the originals and clones since they<br>
have the same mind states) live in worlds where coin landed heads.<br>
<p>
Of course the many-minds interpretation wouldn't be interesting if it<br>
doesn't offer any advantages over the baysian interpretation, but the<br>
baysian interpretation seems to fail when cloning is involved. After<br>
waking up and also being told that you're not a clone, a simple Dutch book<br>
argument says your probability for heads should be 1/2, which implies that<br>
your probability should be 2/3 before knowing that you're not a clone. But<br>
as Eliezer pointed out, the baysian interpretation requires probability<br>
shifts (in this case the shift from 1/2 before sleep to 2/3 after sleep) <br>
to be based on new information, which does not seem to be present. <br>
