<i>&gt;something new.</i><br>
<p>
I've played around with a animated planner, and with a 3D chart<br>
that shows interlinks between various technologies. The animation is<br>
particularly interesting, one can show future projections as <br>
semi-transparent objects, with surface properties based for instance <br>
on the degree of likelyhood, importance, field, applications, etc. It <br>
gives a more "gut' feel for progress than a 2D chart.<br>

<i>&gt;Yes, I think this will be the next big thing. The in-your-pocket</i><br>

<p>
Jeez. I'd pay for one right now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I would like is a molecular film that acts as a cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt;automaton. Maybe we could use the microtubule units?</i><br>
<p>
What for? How small a unit cell? How many (how few, actually)? <br>
Is there a market for this that cannot be filled with projected<br>
Si 'von Neumann' chips?<br>
What film thickness would you like?<br>
What good is a microtubule? It has to be in water, no?<br>
<p>
Any other ideas for thin-film, nearly nanotech products?<br>
<p>
