They would have if they ever found out. In fact, I'm sure they would be<br>

stolen bodyparts in the middle of their cosy little neighborhood. <br>

Ok, any tips?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I've thought about it a lot. I don't see anyone attacking the internet</i><br>
now<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; theoretically possible). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Take a look at the controversies about pornography on the internet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the spread of illegal information and terrorism. I don't know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; dutch media, but here in sweden the coverage have tended towards the</i><br>
<i>&gt; very negative. </i><br>
The net doesn't really seem hyped around here, in one way or another.<br>
Holland is almost pornography heaven. Hardcore is for sale at most<br>
newsstands and bookstores, and there are plenty of specialized porn<br>
stores in most larger cities. Besides kiddieporn (under 16 years) just<br>
about anything goes. There are even some excellent sex with animals mags<br>
from...Sweden!<br>
<p>
To my knowledge most of the onholy attempts to fight porn on the net<br>
have failed thus far, even in the puritan-infested good ol' USA. Even if<br>
they<br>
could pass some of those sanctimonious laws, they could never tame<br>
the net. It would require co-operation of all (major) governments in the<br>
world, and even then...it would backfire on them anyway. Hackers would<br>
now have all the excuse in the world to attack government computers, and a<br>
even a single individual can do a lot of damage. Besides, how could the<br>
governments ever finance and police such all-out operation? The "war on<br>
drugs" already takes up most of their resources, and there is even a limit<br>
to taxation.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Several politicians have proposed some rather draconian</i><br>
<i>&gt; measures to prevent the spread of this nastiness, but have failed</i><br>
<i>&gt; largely due to party politics. </i><br>
As far as I know the politicians in holland are trying to get as many<br>
people *on* the net as possible (don't know exactly why, maybe just<br>
to look modern or something). They might regret this one day...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The first time internet was mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; seriously in a swedish movie it was of course a movie about</i><br>
<i>&gt; international child pornography. </i><br>
I usually find swedish movies very depressing, so it doesn't really<br>
surprise me that when the internet is mentioned they automatically show its<br>
worst side  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I guess that</i><br>
<i>&gt; when people start to move to untaxable digital money, the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; will see that as a direct attack.</i><br>
But what can they do about it, and how would this affect transhumanism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism might be attacked (regardless of what its proponents</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might say or do) when it gets "too big for comfort".  Right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transhumanists are usually seen as a bunch of computer nerds with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; silly SF fantasies, harmless Utopians. When there will be more the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government and the press and (thus) the public _might_ "rediscover"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them and some "incriminating evidence" will be fabricated to justify</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; persecution. Its been done time and again...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. And frankly, it isn't that hard to find disturbing stuff in</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism that could easily be used against it. That is why we</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to get our ideas into the mainstream as much as possible instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of trying to work in splendid isolation - we are vulnerable as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; separate group.</i><br>
Well, I'm working on a text for the local group for the proliferation of<br>
transhumanistic ideas *right now* :-)<br>
