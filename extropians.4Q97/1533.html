<i> &gt;: That's not my experience.</i><br>
<i> &gt;: Because why are so many European governements privatising things like</i><br>
<i> &gt;: railroads and telecom then? Giving away control over transport &amp;</i><br>
<i> &gt;: communication to 'the market'? Not the thing power-hungry 'terrocrats'</i><br>
<i> &gt;: (one of the strangest - and paranoid - terms I've learned on this list)</i><br>
<i> &gt;: would do.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Perhaps I exaggerated a bit; but why did they take control over transport</i><br>
<i> &gt;in the first place?</i><br>
<p>
Well (little private theorising here) in the last century, when railroad<br>
infrastruture was being contstructed, Europe was already a densly populated<br>
area with a complex society. And most country's weren't truly democratic.<br>
States were the only ones capable of undertaking such projects and so they<br>
did. Also in Europe good infrastructure was vital for military reasons. In<br>
the US there was no Royalty in the classic sense and lotsa more room for<br>
anybody with a daring idea. All of this is just an 'educated guess' - maybe<br>
there are historians on the list who can shed a light on this. They<br>
question why states came into existance in the various form they did and<br>
what caused the *differences* is relevant to anyone wishing to obsolete<br>
them, know your enemy and all that ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;	[...]</i><br>
<i> &gt;: If the US had not fought the Cold war (and WW-II) many more people would</i><br>
<i> &gt;: have died. There was no alternative, you can't coexist with the likes of</i><br>
<i> &gt;: Stalin and the German guy. You win the war or you get dead/annexated</i><br>
<i> &gt;: (almost as bad).</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;And if we'd let the Georgian and the German beat on each other for</i><br>
<i> &gt;a few more years, before we intervened? We might have been rid of</i><br>
<i> &gt;both of them.</i><br>
<p>
Possibly, but the number of citizens killed in that war might very well<br>
have been larger, also you run the risk that one of 'em (say Stalin) wins<br>
and takes over all of Europe. Had the allies been 3 weeks later, Stalin<br>
would have rolled his tanks all the way to the Dutch-German border, or<br>
maybe the Northsea.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;	[...]</i><br>
<i> &gt;: But maybe I still do not fully understand anarchocapitalism. In such</i><br>
<i> &gt;: a society, without a state of any sort, who makes and upholds laws?</i><br>
<i> &gt;: or is it every person for him/herself?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Most law enforcement *is* at the individual level.</i><br>
<i> &gt;You have locks on your doors, no?</i><br>
<p>
Wiil a lock be enough? The only way to prevent criminals to enter my house<br>
and loot the place (Yes, certain things I own are important to me) would be<br>
to live in a fortress or to have some kind of weapon to discourage them. I<br>
don't much like the first option and the alternative would lead to a<br>
personal arms race between me and anybody that I think might want to hurt<br>
me. I gues you know the argument... I see no way out of this.<br>
<p>
I'm not even going to make a long case about such a society being quickly<br>
conquered by a society that didn't abolish the cetralised state (and thus<br>
has a large, heavily equipped army).<br>
<p>
As I remember it, groups of people long ago tried to fix this problem by<br>
forming clans and agreeing to not fight among themselves and spare there<br>
energies for any external threat. Soon thereafter they made wall around<br>
their encampments and called it a city. Then someone thought that they<br>
would be even safer if they worked together with another city (of course if<br>
the other city didn't agree battering rams became the tools of the argument<br>
- I agree with you infofar that this is a far cry from perfect, political<br>
solutions seldom are).<br>
<p>
I think you'd want to abolish these groups and take your chances whereas<br>
people like Joao Pedro and me what to extend the group to every human on<br>
the planet and take our chances won't turn on us. We're both taking risks<br>
(jump in here Joao, if you feel I'm misinterpreting your posts).<br>

<i> &gt;Practical examples: Bruce Benson, _The Enterprise of Law_.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Fictional hints: Neil Smith, _Converse and Conflict_;</i><br>
<i> &gt;                 Neal Stephenson, _The Diamond Age_.</i><br>
<p>
Thanx! this is most usefull, I'll try to get hold of some copies (and find<br>
the time to read them ;-).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;: How do you go from the present situation to such a system?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;That's the hard part! The important thing is to prepare the culture,</i><br>
<i> &gt;to teach people that obedience to the State is not the same thing as</i><br>
<i> &gt;justice; that the State is not something divine and eternal, but a</i><br>
<i> &gt;creation of imperfect men, which ought to be discarded - not merely</i><br>
<i> &gt;reformed - when it proves destructive to the purposes for which it is</i><br>
<i> &gt;generally held to exist.</i><br>
<p>
I guess we agree up to here.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;When enough people understand that, we can</i><br>
<i> &gt;build parallel institutions, to be ready when the State is weakest.</i><br>
<p>
I just don't see that states in general (altough most of them are rotten to<br>
various extends) are so destructive compared to the expected performance of<br>
alternatives. But maybe we speak from different perspectives and experiences.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Most "revolutions" simply take the apparatus of the pre-existing State</i><br>
<i> &gt;and give it new commands - not only because the apparatus is convenient</i><br>
<i> &gt;to the conquerors, but also because most people can't imagine living</i><br>
<i> &gt;without their favorite state office (and there's already a supply of</i><br>
<i> &gt;bureaucrats who know how to run that office!).</i><br>
<p>
This is correct, also: most revolutions aren not 'Spontanious Uprisings' by<br>
'The People' but a planned coup d'etat organised by a small group of<br>
individuals (Example: the takeover by Lenin in 1917, heavily sponsored by<br>
the German war office who wanted to de-stabilize their Russian enemies on<br>
Germany's Eastern front).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;My dream is to build free institutions *beside* the State, in no way</i><br>
<i> &gt;dependent on it, so that if the State should crumble we'll be no more</i><br>
<i> &gt;disturbed than if some big corporation - AT&amp;T, let's say - goes out</i><br>
<i> &gt;of business.  (I don't mean to imply *no* disturbance. If AT&amp;T crashes</i><br>
<i> &gt;millions of people will be inconvenienced for a few weeks, but there</i><br>
<i> &gt;are other wires.)</i><br>
<p>
Problem remains how you can garuantee in any way that these institutions<br>
don't become the instruments of dictators or some such (without any form of<br>
democratic control). One of the oldest political problems, who will guard<br>
us from our guardians? But I agree that it's always good to have a backups. <br>
