<p>
You have touched upon another component of my ruminations yesterday:  <br>
the difference between gratitude and thanksgiving.  For most of us <br>
raised within a Judeo-Christian culture, the two concepts have become <br>
intertwined, because we are taught that we are unworthy creatures who <br>
do not really deserve the abundance we enjoy in life--the goodies <br>
have been bestowed upon us through the benevolence of a higher being. <br>
We should, therefore, be grateful for whatever is given us.  When one <br>
expresses gratitude, one implies that one is completely undeserving <br>
and that one owes the person/higher being in ways that can never be <br>
repaid.  I can see expressing gratitude to another person in <br>
instances such as someone saving one's life, but to express gratitude <br>
on all levels does not seem consistent with transhuman ideas.<br>
<p>
The act of giving thanks, on the other hand, consists of an <br>
expression of appreciation and enjoyment.  As such, it can be <br>
directed at any person, organization, or even to ourselves.  You, <br>
Natasha and Dave provided wonderful examples of giving thanks in your <br>
postings yesterday.  Thank you for doing that!<br>
