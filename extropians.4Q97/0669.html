<i>&gt;Dear Freespeak:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe we had better work on Freethink before we Freespeak.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, that's the main problem with trying to administer a government</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the common good.  It's simply that most people don't think in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the common good if they think at all.</i><br>
<p>
        I have yet to see proof that there is such thing as a "common good."<br>
If there *is* such a thing, I seriously doubt that any sort of government<br>
can represent a common good, regardless of whether the government in<br>
question is democratic, socialist, facist or communist.  Whenever a<br>
government claims that they are out to attain the "common good of the<br>
people," the general outcome is one of a struggling economy and a<br>
diminished quality of life; is that a common good?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Everybody has at least one opinion that they flatulate</i><br>
<i>&gt;on a regular basis. The problem is if they have an opinion that's the</i><br>
<i>&gt;limit of their perception. In other words no one elses opinion matters or</i><br>
<i>&gt;is even listened to.</i><br>
<p>
        I partially agree with this on the account that many people form<br>
opinions without considering alternatives.  Where I think you err is in<br>
your presumption that all people who don't believe in government have<br>
linear thought; on the contrary, history has shown that governments<br>
fail...people who<br>
insist that government will work are the ones who are not considering any<br>
proposition otherwise.  An anarchist\libertarian system has not, to my<br>
knowledge, been tried.  Is it not open-minded to want to try something new?<br>
If an anarchist\libertarian system had already been tried a few times in<br>
history, I think you might have a leg to stand on.  In effect, you have to<br>
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that such a system cannot work; this can't<br>
accurately be done unless it is tried.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It never ceases to amaze me as to how ideologicaly fixated and parochial</i><br>
<i>&gt;we've all become. </i><br>
<i>&gt;You can fantasize about your perception of government until the cows come</i><br>
<i>&gt;home but how are you going to impliment what you believe?</i><br>
<p>
        I think the same could be asked of you: how are you going to<br>
implement a government that can effectively produce the "common good" you<br>
refer to?  It very well may be that the only accurate way this can be done<br>
is to have a government of six billion people or none.<br>
