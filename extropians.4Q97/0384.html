THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART II<br>

FREEDOM SHIP - THE MOST ADVANCED FREEDOM PROJECT YET<br>
====================================================<br>

<p>
<p>
Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
In conception, 'Freedom Ship' seems to be one of the<br>
most advanced freedom projects I know of.  It's a<br>
project to build a huge ship, three times as long as<br>
the Empire State Building is tall -- 4310 ft. long,<br>
725ft. wide.  It will have a superstructure, rising<br>
25 stories above its deck.  It will have space for<br>
at least 50,000 residents, 15,000 personnel, and<br>
20,000 guests and visitors.<br>
<p>
It will be powered by 100 diesel engines and will<br>
circle the world once every two years.  About<br>
25% of the time it will be underway at sea, and<br>
about 75% of the time it will be holding in-place<br>
in coastal waters near major cities.<br>
<p>
Other features of'Freedom Ship':<br>
* A commercial center with a free-enterprise economy.<br>
* Residential and commercial condominiums.<br>
* High-quality, fresh food and clean water.<br>
* $200,000,000 hospital.<br>
* Superb safety and security.<br>
* Excellent banking and communication facilities.<br>
* 3,800 ft. airplane landing strip.<br>
* Fleet of commuter aircraft and hydrofoils.<br>
* Duty/tax-free shopping.<br>
* Educational, recreational, and entertainment facilities.<br>
* Modest cost of living.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't know whether the people behind 'Freedom Ship'<br>
have their act sufficiently together to succeed.  It's<br>
a lot easier to put up a sophisticated website than<br>
to build a huge ship.  Nevertheless, I'm highly<br>
impressed with what I've seen so far and with my<br>
limited contact with people involved in the project.<br>
<p>
I've heard a rumor that 'Popular Mechanics' is<br>
working on an extensive article on 'Freedom Ship,'<br>
possibly with a picture on the front cover.  If<br>
this comes about, it could boost interest and<br>
reservations substantially.<br>

<p>
<p>
The Economic Means to Freedom<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<p>
This is the second in a series of articles on the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first article<br>
covered three principles: (1) Opportunity Gap;<br>
(2) Three Economic Sectors -- public, private,<br>
and free-enterprise; and (3) Free-Enterprise<br>
Institutions.  You can receive the first article<br>
by a request to &lt;<a href="mailto:f-prime@activist.com">mailto:f-prime@activist.com</a>&gt; or<br>
access it at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
The Opportunity Gap is the difference between<br>
where people are and where they could or should<br>
be.  The essence of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
is to provide people with the means to bridge the<br>
Opportunity Gap -- to advance from where they are<br>
to where they could or should be.<br>
<p>
If 'Freedom Ship' succeeds, it will achieve this<br>
in several respects.  Residents will enjoy a high<br>
quality of life with superb safety and security,<br>
while travelling the world in style and comfort.<br>
Both residents and businesses will enjoy the<br>
absence of terrocrats(coercive political agents<br>
or terrorist bureacrats) and the benefits of<br>
free-enterprise.<br>
<p>
'Freedom Ship' could also become an outstanding<br>
example of a Free-Enterprise Institution -- the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom in practice.  It may<br>
become a model for others to emulate.<br>
<p>
<p>
Money Can Buy Freedom<br>
---------------------<br>
<p>
The fourth principle of the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom is that money can buy freedom.  It can<br>
buy you the freedom to live where you want to<br>
and to travel when and where you want to.  Money<br>
can buy a group of people the freedom to build<br>
a 'Freedom Ship' and to escape the tyranny of<br>
terrocrats.<br>
<p>
Money can buy you freedom from having to work<br>
to earn a living.  To a considerable extent,<br>
money can buy you freedom from illness and<br>
disease.  Money can buy you the freedom of a<br>
longer life.  Within a few decades, money may<br>
even be able to buy freedom from death.<br>
<p>
Consider the possibility that using money in<br>
profitable ways to expand freedom -- the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom -- is by far the<br>
most powerful freedom strategy.  This is because<br>
it can set a snowball effect in motion.  Part<br>
of the profits can be used to increase or expand<br>
freedom-promoting activities and enterprises<br>
in profitable ways.  These profits can be used<br>
in turn to expand further...<br>
<p>
Money can probably buy freedom to a greater<br>
extent than even I have begun to imagine...<br>
<p>
This will become more evident as we expand<br>
free-enterprise currency, banking, and barter<br>
institutions, such as those mentioned in the<br>
first article of this series.<br>
<p>
<p>
No-Opposition Strategy<br>
----------------------<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"If you can avoid it, never play on the other guy's field, by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other guy's rules, or with the other guy's ball.  He didn't design</i><br>
<i>&gt;_his_ system to give _you_ the advantage.  Remember that organisms</i><br>
<i>&gt;defending their own territory are twice as effective as an intruding</i><br>
<i>&gt;attacker." -- L. Neil Smith</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Here's the fifth main principle of the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom.  When we oppose something, or try to reform it,<br>
we usually encounter opposition.  Our effort elicits<br>
an almost automatic counter-effort.  In practicing the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom, we don't attempt to change,<br>
oppose, reform, or overthrow any  political or economic<br>
systems.  We simply create our own voluntary alternatives<br>
in the free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
'Freedom Ship' is an excellent example of this principle<br>
in action.<br>
<p>
The bogus power of terrocrats depends on the support<br>
from their victims.  In practicing the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom, we find practical ways to legally, elegantly,<br>
and safely withdraw our support.  The power of terrocrats<br>
is tenuous -- largely based on illusion, flimsy, fragile,<br>
and of little substance.<br>
<p>
Understanding this dynamic of human power enabled Mohandas<br>
Gandhi to play a major role in the defeat of the armed might<br>
of the British Empire without firing a shot.  The East German<br>
terrocrats, backed by 300,000 Russian troops, could not keep<br>
the Berlin wall standing, once a critical mass of people just<br>
said "NO!" to the system.  When the victims of the Soviet<br>
terrocrats withdrew their support, the Soviet Empire<br>
collapsed overnight.<br>
<p>
Because of gradual currency debasement (inflation), budget<br>
deficits, property seizures, Nazi-like terrorism (like Waco<br>
and Ruby Creek), fragile schemes like "social security" and<br>
"medicare," and other criminal violations, terrocrats are<br>
in the process of destroying their own coercive power systems.<br>
They are gradually losing credibility and control.<br>
<p>
The example of 'Freedom Ship' may set in motion a whole<br>
range of initiatives whereby many more people find practical<br>
and profitable ways to withdraw their support from terrocrats. <br>
<p>
A basic theme of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
is "building freedom" rather than "fighting for<br>
freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."  I believe<br>
that if a critical mass of people were to focus<br>
on building freedom, corrupt political systems<br>
will eventually lose their power and influence.<br>
