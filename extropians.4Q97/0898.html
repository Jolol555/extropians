I think you are mistaking the German view.<br>
It's true that there is much intolerance regarding foreign religions in the<br>
German public and I'm not glad about this at all.<br>
But the point why the government fights the "church" of Scientology is not<br>
what the scientologists believe but what they do.<br>
Their intention appears not to be religion but commerce and suppression and<br>
exploitation of their members. So there are voices who demand not to consider<br>
them a church but sort of company.<br>
Religion is free in Germany, but a religious community has to keep to German<br>
laws, that's all.<br>
If the Scientologists' aim is to take over control of the whole world, this<br>
is against German constitution.<br>
I do not try to defend the German government as I myself do not agree with<br>
them in many points, just trying to explain.<br>
And all this has really nothing to do with what happened here a long time<br>
ago.<br>
