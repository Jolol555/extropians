<i>&gt; Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt; [the usual tripe...]</i><br>
<p>
While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is<br>
it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like<br>
the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?  Why are those<br>
who don't like Microsoft's tacics not using those same tacticts,<br>
since they obviously work?  (And don't give me any bullshit about<br>
how morally upstanding a company Netscape is).  Why do they always<br>
complain simultaneouly that (a) Users must be told to band together<br>
to stop using MS products, and (b) MS products suck?  Obviously,<br>
one of those two must be wrong, because if the products sucked, you<br>
wouldn't have to tell anyone not to use them.<br>
<p>
Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called<br>
monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government<br>
will do everything in its power to keep it in power.   And it won't<br>
be because some clueless group of whiners staged a boycott; it will<br>
be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will<br>
have made a better product.  If you want to hasten that day, fine:<br>
don't avoid MS products; just keep buying good ones.  Innovation is<br>
what kills monopolies, and MS has never innovated in its life.<br>
<p>
Someone should go the idea futures exchange and make the following<br>
proposition, so that I can buy shares:<br>
<p>
"By January 1, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (or the aggregate of all<br>
sub-entities it may have been ordered to split into) will own less<br>
than 50% market share in its product with highest sales."<br>
