The issue of government control over health issues is difficult because<br>
it threatens people with the use of force.  In order to discuss them in<br>
a less threatening way a slightly different scenario may be helpful.<br>
<p>
Imagine that you are going to live on or visit a space station.<br>
In different stations there are different policies involving quarantine<br>
of people who carry infectious diseases.  In some stations there is no<br>
quarantine and everyone can wander freely.  In other stations anyone<br>
who carries any infectious disease, even a common cold, is required to<br>
be isolated until the disease is no longer infectious.  Other stations<br>
take a more moderate stance, where only the most serious diseases lead<br>
to quarantine.<br>
<p>
There might also be stations where people are not quarantined, but where<br>
they are required to inform others (perhaps by a low-power data transmission)<br>
of which diseases they are carrying.<br>
<p>
You are going to make your decision about which station to visit on the<br>
basis of its policies in this regard.  Those stations with more restrictive<br>
policies give you the advantage of not being exposed to as many diseases,<br>
but if you should become infected your own mobility will be limited.  It's<br>
a tradeoff, and you can make your own judgements about which you would<br>
prefer.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that I would prefer the more restrictive policies, because<br>
by living there I would be exposed to many fewer diseases, so in practice<br>
the chances of my becoming infected and subject to quarantine would be<br>
small.  It's true that the consequences to me would be significant if I<br>
should be so unlucky as to become infected, but the chances of that are<br>
so reduced that I think this would be my preferred option.<br>
<p>
Others can make their own decisions.  This is the extropian way.<br>
<p>
