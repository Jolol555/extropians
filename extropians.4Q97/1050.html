<i>&gt; No, not even the belief that libertarianism is a good thing. Libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; is quite strictly defined (even though there are different ways of defining</i><br>
? it). I don't think it would be accurate to call any view that allows *any*<br>
<i>&gt;  taxation to be libertarian. Any form of taxation seems to violate</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian principles. Even minimal statists (like Rand) try to find</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-coercive (by the libertarian standard) methods of financing their</i><br>
<i>&gt; minimal state -- user fees directly for services, lotteries, etc.</i><br>
<p>
      A preliminary note: Popper makes the point that the value of any <br>
      discussion is inversely proportional to the time spent on discussing <br>
      definitions (one Popperian writes to another...  &gt;:-} ).  Nothing <br>
      much hinges on words and definitions, although some words are worth <br>
      fighting for (a Goldwater Liberal writes...  &gt;:-} ).  Good <br>
      definitions read 'from right to left' anyway.<br>
      <br>
      For me, libertarianism _is_ a mindset or world-view or value system <br>
      that places great (even oparamount) importance on maximizing <br>
      self-liberation, autonomy and a maximally (positively and <br>
      negatively) free and open society. Bryan Magee emphasized to me from <br>
      our first correspondence in 1977, that he was _above all things a <br>
      libertarian_.  As Milton friedman says, there is no ascertainable <br>
      and unambiguous ontological basis to property rights.  Property <br>
      rights are ineluctably consensual social constructs.<br>
      <br>
      As Robert LeFevre pointed out, to assert an exclusive claim to a<br>
      territory or piece of property (other than one's own body) is one <br>
      thing (hand-waving or argument).  To initiate aggression or violence <br>
      to enforce the claim against another is _wrong_.<br>
<p>
      At Geelong Grammar School in Australia, kids used to tell me of <br>
      their parents going on Aborigine hunts at week-ends, because the <br>
      'Abos' wouldn't respect (settler) property demarcations (fences) and <br>
      ownership of animals (sheep).  So their parents shot and poisoned <br>
      the 'Abos'... For _recreation_ and for _social control_... <br>
      <br>
      Australia was declared -- dishonestly -- 'Terra Nullius' (unoccupied <br>
      territory) by the British colonial authorities.  The Aboriginal <br>
      occupants had no concept or convention of personally owned real <br>
      estate or livestock. They roamed over vast territories (roaming <br>
      rights which the present Courts are increasingly recognizing).<br>
<p>
<p>
      What rational objection can you have to people negotiating <br>
      agreements to the _particular_ 'Wertfrei' catallaxy or economic <br>
      system they will consent to participating in, with (something like) <br>
      taxes constituting their fee for participation in a <br>
      (Pareto-optimal?) catallaxy?<br>

<i>&gt; I think this is a really important issue for the propagation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism. I think you may be right about standard Christians, Muslims,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Mormons. After all, Muslims believe fundamentally in submission to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Allah. That and typical Christian beliefs in an active God whose plan for</i><br>
<i>&gt; us must be followed clearly does conflict with transhumanism. Your citation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my passage suggests that.</i><br>
<p>
      Popper contrasts two views of religion:<br>
      <br>
      [A] "Dominate, or prostrate yourself."  -- _Rationally and morally <br>
      unacceptable_.<br>
      <br>
      Compare and contrast with:<br>
      <br>
      [B] Always remember that -- while men are not gods -- each of us has <br>
      a divine spark." -- Acceptable.  Viz: 'The God of Spinoza.'<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
       <br>
      Judaism doesn't involve faith -- Judaism is a matter of <br>
      _observances_ and _practices_.   Interestingly, a great many <br>
      libertarian writers come from a Jewish background, or so Chris Tame <br>
      tells me.  Barry Goldwater, ferinstance...  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
  "Freedom means doing whatever you damn well please." -- Barry Goldwater.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd be interested in what others think of this. Are there</i><br>
<i>&gt; other practices counted as religious that might not conflict with</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism?</i><br>
<p>
      Jewish Cabbalistic doctrine holds that Nature, the Universe and God <br>
      are all the same.  Even the gematria matches this, oddly enough.<br>
<p>
      Scientology?  <a href="http://www.scientology.org">http://www.scientology.org</a><br>
<p>
      How about Classical Greek mythology?  (Read 'Practical Greek Magic" <br>
      by Murry Hope (Aquarian, [1985]).  It's brilliant, quite rational, <br>
      witty and profoundly inspirational.  "The Heroic Path!"<br>
