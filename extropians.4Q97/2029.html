<i>&gt; Greg: what about Hong Kong?  It has a higher GDP/capita than any of the</i><br>

<i>&gt;  27500 Hong Kong (same as US!)) and was under the British.  Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Confucian capitalism, or have they assimilated Western values?</i><br>
<p>
Of course I should have mentioned HK!  If memory serves, Hong Kong was a<br>
little fishing village before the Brits made it their base of operations in<br>
the area.  Although always a numeric minority (finally a tiny minority), the<br>
English GREATLY influenced the development of Hong Kong's culture, especially<br>
its business and legal culture.  At the same level of gross generalization as<br>
my original post, I would posit that Hong Kong is another exception that<br>
proves the rule: The well-known business creativity of Hong Kong business<br>
people may well mark one of the very best blendings of the Confucian values<br>
of secularism, industry and thrift with the Western bourgeois values of<br>
individualism, irreverence and creativity.  Let's hope that China's<br>
swallowing of HK in fact results in the ingestion and dissemenation of those<br>
good memes.<br>

<i>&gt; [sinp] People who object to Western culture</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and "values" have no qualms about grabbing our factories and planes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Perhaps we should put more emphasis on the practical benefits of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  societies, and cut the appeals to morals they don't share.</i><br>
<p>
Well, this is the very problem about which I am concerned: In much of Asia<br>
there is a risk that some of the important liberal values usually associated<br>
with capitalism in the West (especially individual liberty and the<br>
transparent rule of law) may NOT be automatically coincidental with adoption<br>
of western industrial technology and its consumerist output.<br>
