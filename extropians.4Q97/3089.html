Social justice is the idea that its wrong for you to have more than me,<br>
so you should either a)feel guilty about it and give me an equal share,<br>
or b) sit peacably by while I or some third party is justified in<br>
forcibly confiscating it from you if you don't feel guilty about keeping<br>
what you obviously don't deserve (cause you're a selfish, insensitive,<br>
abusive, sexist, bigoted, racist creep), and I or some third party<br>
obviously has a much better idea of how to waste it away on my own<br>
needs.<br>
<p>
Justice is what happens to you when you forcibly try to prevent me or<br>
some third party from taking from you what I feel I deserve.<br>
