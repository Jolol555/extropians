Freeman's version is by no means universally accepted by scholars.  In<br>
Australian anthropological circles (his home base), he tends to be<br>
dismissed as a somewhat unstable figure with a bee in his bonnet and a chip<br>
on his shoulder.  I have no special knowledge of my own to add to this.  <br>

<p>
for a relevant book:<br>
<p>
ADOLESCENT STORM AND STRESS<br>
<p>
An Evaluation of the Mead-Freeman Controversy<br>
<p>
James E. Cote<br>
University of Western Ontario<br>
A Volume in the Research Monographs in Adolescence Series<br>
<p>
The outline strikes me as somewhat mealy-mouthed but indicative, e.g.:<br>
<p>
"While much has been written about this controversy during the past decade,<br>
a gap exists in the sense<br>
that most of the publicity about Mead's work has missed her main focus<br>
concerning the processes<br>
governing the "coming of age" of her informants. A valuable historical<br>
document and a pioneering<br>
study, Mead's book anticipated changes that are still unfolding today in<br>
the field of human<br>
development. The preoccupation with issues tangential to her main focus --<br>
issues involving the<br>
Samoan ethos and character -- have not only diverted a clear analysis of<br>
Mead's work, they have<br>
also led to the creation of a number of myths and misconceptions about Mead<br>
and her book. The<br>
author also has an interest in Mead's original focus on the relative impact<br>
of biological and cultural<br>
influences in shaping the behavior of those coming of age -- in all<br>
societies. Despite what has been<br>
said by her critics, not only was this a crucial issue during the time of<br>
her study, but it is also an issue<br>
that is now just beginning to be understood some 60 years later. In<br>
addition, the issue of biology<br>
versus culture -- the so-called nature-nurture debate -- carries with it<br>
many political implications. In<br>
the case of the Mead-Freeman controversy, this political agenda looms large<br>
-- an agenda which is<br>
clearly spelled out in this book."<br>

As usual, dichtomomies are not as cut&amp;dried as they might appear at first...<br>
