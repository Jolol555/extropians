<i>&gt;&gt;Not recognized by who? As far as the US government is concerned, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;every single driver in this country is liable for the "Implied </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Consent Law," without having signed anything. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, that's their claim, by breathing the air on any land mass on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Earth's surface you have in effect signed away your rights and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "voluntarily" given some government the power of life and death over </i><br>
<i>&gt; you. It matters not at all if you or I think this reasoning makes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightest sense or not because they have the power to enforce it </i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: So, if I walk into someone's property <br>
  I get to stay rent free so long as I don't <br>
  sign any contract: "You can't throw me out,<br>
  I never signed the contract." What a deal!<br>
<p>
  The scenario you cite is not resolved by <br>
  every inch of land being "privately" owned <br>
  with every landlord having a set of rules,<br>
  regulations, and rent. Hence, complaining<br>
  about a fait where all land is claimed is <br>
  weighing in for or against libertarianism. <br>
 <br>
  You suggest that governments have this unique<br>
  attribute that if you stand on gov't property<br>
  you are subject to gov't law,  but the same <br>
  holds for private property;  therefore the<br>
  alleged unique attribute of gov't that is<br>
  bemoaned does not actually exist as any-<br>
  thing unique to this thing called "gov't."<br>
<p>
  There are claims upon land and the claimants<br>
  demand a rent/tax from other people who <br>
  inhabit the areas within the claims. When<br>
  I got to the Earth, every inch was already <br>
  claimed, so I have to agree to pay the fees,<br>
  try to evade payment, or overthrow the claim.<br>
<p>
  Libertarians want to evade payment to large-<br>
  scale land holders, while socialists want to <br>
  evade payments to small-scale land holders.<br>
  Now there's funny twist that we uncover<br>
  from this line of inquiry. Hmmm....<br>
<p>
  Aren't socialists for the little guy?<br>
<p>
