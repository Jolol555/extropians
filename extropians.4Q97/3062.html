Maybe a human boy is worth more than a cat.  Maybe light abuse on a<br>
human is worse than severe abuse on a cat.  Maybe the smacks were overly<br>
severe if the boy was still complaining of pain later at school.  Maybe<br>
the marks weren't so temporary if school officials thought the marks<br>
were severe enough to call the police, the police thought the marks were<br>
severe enough to arrest the man, and a judge thought the marks were<br>
severe enough to find him guilty and issue a fine in a court of law.  Do<br>
you have any information concerning this case that would indicate that<br>
all these people misrepresented or misinterpretted the marks on the body<br>
of the 7 year old boy?<br>
<p>
And what does any of this have to do with Extropins?<br>
