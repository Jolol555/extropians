<i>&gt; Whoops.  Don't know how that junk post went through.  Sorry.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What evidence for an ice age?  The global temperature has increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; half a degree in the past century.</i><br>
<p>
The major problem with that claim is that identifiable sources of <br>
possible error convert it to something on the order of "The global <br>
temperature is someplace between two degrees colder and three degrees <br>
warmer than a century ago, with the most likely value being half a <br>
degree warmer."<br>
<p>
The other problem is that to the extent that we can track WHEN this <br>
change occurred, it appears that about 80% of the effect occurred <br>
*before* 80% of the alleged cause.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How can we say that?  There was a happy ecosystem, yes.  There was</i><br>
<i>&gt; not a happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to live near</i><br>
<i>&gt; shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.</i><br>
<p>
No significant evidence of major change in swamp area as a result of <br>
temperature changes in this range.  No significant evidence of <br>
non-trivial shoreline changes.  No significant evidence of changes in <br>
flooding patterns.  DIFFERENT plants grow well, but the basic level <br>
of biodiversity is not significantly affected.  In other words, <br>
nothing that would be particularly significant to agricultural humans <br>
who tend to live near shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think we can say that we are busy putting the CO2 of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Carboniferous back into the atmosphere.  The Carboniferous had Very</i><br>
<i>&gt; Large dragonflies and cockroaches.  Some people might consider this</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth a thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; global-warming doomsayers are right in their predictions.  What if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the ice-age doomsayers are right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the absence of further evidence, I prefer to assume that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economists are right.  There are various things we should be doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway, which would be cheap insurance.  Not actively subsidizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; coal and other high-carbon fuels.  (Spain and Germany subsidize</i><br>
<i>&gt; their coal, and I suspect the US spent more on the Gulf War than on</i><br>
<i>&gt; renewable energy sources.)  Being more energy efficient in general.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, while global warming is a possible threat,</i><br>
<i>&gt; deforestation, desertification, aquifer depletion, and sperm count</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterioration are all actually happening, as is air pollution in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mexico City and Beijing which make LA seem like a health spa.  There</i><br>
<i>&gt; are environmental problems with higher urgency.</i><br>
<p>
That I'll agree to -- with qualifications.  The major qualification <br>
being that most of the heavily industrialized nation are <br>
re-foresting, and have been for more than 50 years, and government <br>
mandates are NOT a significant part of this trend.<br>
<p>
A second qualification is that we don't really know the cause OR <br>
SIGNIFICANCE of the sperm count depletion.  If it's happening due to <br>
stress rather than pollution, for example, it isn't a pollution <br>
problem.  If it's occurring primarily in industrialized nations, <br>
well, most families in industrialized nations put far more effort <br>
into preventing pregnancy than in trying to achieve it (as opposed to <br>
mating for other purposes), so it doesn't seem like such a tragedy.<br>
<p>
And another big qualification is that we know the causes of several <br>
of these others, and the environmental socialists' proposed remedies <br>
virtually guarantee that the problems will continue unchecked.  (In <br>
fact the origin of the problem in many cases is that dictatorial <br>
governments more or less impose these remedies for reasons having far <br>
more to do with control than with the environment.)<br>
