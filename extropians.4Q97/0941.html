The core is dense and magnetic, which implies a metal; iron is a very<br>
common element, and has density, elasticity and electrical properties<br>
similar to those of the core.  (I quote Britannica.)  I'm not sure how<br>
they determined electrical properties of the core; the other two would<br>
be from seismic tomography.  As for crysttalline nature, well, at those<br>
tempertatures and pressures you *assume* something is crystalline.<br>

The core is somewhat less dense than pure iron at core conditions, so<br>
you guess it is impure, and you guess the impurities from abundances and<br>
chemisty.  And by modelling; a 90 % iron core with sulfur, oxygen, and<br>
possibly a bit of extra crud matches seismic observations.<br>

Yep.  I think there's still a good bit of ignorance; last I heard<br>
someone was saying the core doesn't rotate at the same rate as the rest<br>
of the Earth.  I forget all details.<br>
