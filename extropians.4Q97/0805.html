1.  London Prints the Facts...Why Not Here?  Did Strassmeir Purposely Provoke<br>
OKC Bombing?<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
        Is it really a surprise that Vatican-Rockefeller-CIA toady Clinton would<br>
turn to the German Republic for the perfect deniable intelligence agent to<br>
provoke the bombing he needed so badly?   Germany is a close ally of both the<br>
Pope and the Rockefellers!  .....Co-incidentally an enemy of the Crown?  Not!<br>
Reichstag Fire Re-Run in America?!!<br>
<p>
        Rockefeller control of the American Media vastly improved since it<br>
failed to<br>
save Nixon during Watergate.....Crown lost its grip to Trilateral Juggernaut?<br>

FBI 'knew in advance' of Oklahoma bomb<br>
<p>
THE trial of Timothy McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma bomb was a government<br>
cover-up to shield FBI agents who knew about the plot but failed to stop it,<br>
according to a book by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard alleging massive corruption<br>
under President Clinton.<br>
London Prints the Facts...Why Not Here?<br>
<p>
With McVeigh already sentenced to death for the blast which killed 168<br>
people, and Terry Nichols, an alleged accomplice, standing trial, the book's<br>
claim will spark anger, particularly in Oklahoma City where witnesses saw<br>
bomb squad officers before the explosion, and 70 per cent of citizens believe<br>
that the government is lying about it.<br>
<p>
The Secret Life of Bill Clinton includes a transcript of an official<br>
debriefing of Carol Howe, an undercover informant for the Bureau of Alcohol<br>
Tobacco and Firearms. Howe gave warning that the Oklahoma federal building<br>
has been a target and said: "Strassmeir has talked frequently about direct<br>
action against the US government. He is trained in weaponry and has discussed<br>
assassinations, bombings and mass shootings . . ."<br>
<p>
Andreas Strassmeir, a former German army officer, had penetrated a neo-Nazi<br>
commune called Elohim City (God's City), from which, the book says, the<br>
terrorist attack may have been planned and executed. Despite this and despite<br>
interviewing more than 20,000 witnesses, the government has interviewed<br>
Strassmeir only on the telephone a year after the bombing when he had fled to<br>
Germany.<br>
<p>
The author, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, who worked as The Sunday Telegraph<br>
correspondent in Washington until the summer and who now works for The Daily<br>
Telegraph, recounts a remarkable interview of his own with Strassmeir. They<br>
discuss an "informant". Strassmeir has denied that he was referring to<br>
himself during the conversation.<br>
<p>
Mr Ambrose writes: " 'There comes a time in every botched operation when the<br>
informant has to speak out to save his skin, and that's now, Andreas'. "<br>
<p>
" 'How can he?' Strassmeir shouted into the telephone. "What happens if it<br>
was a sting operation from the very beginning? What happens if it comes out<br>
that the plant was a provocateur?'<br>
<p>
'A provocateur?'<br>
<p>
'What happens if he talked and manipulated the others into it? What then? The<br>
country couldn't handle it. The relatives of the victims are going to go<br>
crazy. He's going to be held responsible for the murder of 168 people.'<br>
<p>
'That is true.'<br>
<p>
'Of course the informant can't come forward. He's scared shitless right now.'<br>
<p>
'It sounds to me as if you've got a problem, Andreas.'<br>
<p>
'Schiesse'. "<br>
<p>
Some 300 members of the victims' families are suing the government claiming<br>
that the bombing was a "government sting" designed to trap neo-Nazis but<br>
which went horribly wrong.<br>
<p>
There is no doubt that McVeigh was guilty, says the author, but the whole<br>
truth has been concealed because none of the witnesses who saw McVeigh with<br>
accomplices was called to testify by the prosecution. That would have led<br>
back to Elohim City and the culpable incompetence of the FBI and ATF, the<br>
book argues.<br>
<p>
These conclusions may gain credence even among the sceptical American press<br>
following comment yesterday by Robert Novak, a respected columnist, in the<br>
Washington Post. Dismissing previous smears of the author, Mr Novak writes,<br>
he "is no conspiracy theory lunatic (and) is known for accuracy, industry and<br>
courage".<br>
<p>
The Secret Life of Bill Clinton also documents a cover-up in the death of<br>
Vince Foster, deputy White House counsel, officially ruled a suicide. The<br>
author has evidence of obstruction and systematic falsehood in the official<br>
version of events - prompting the lead investigator, Miquel Rodriguez, to<br>
resign.<br>
<p>
Patrick Knowlton, a witness, refused to retract testimony that he saw a<br>
thuggish man standing guard at Fort Marcy Park shortly before Mr Foster's<br>
body was found.<br>
<p>
The night before Mr Knowlton's second interrogation by the FBI, his car was<br>
vandalised. The author has tracked down the perpetrator: a freelance FBI<br>
agent with the highest category of security clearance. The book suggests that<br>
Mr Foster's suspicious death may be linked to his incriminating inside<br>
knowledge of alleged corruption in Mr Clinton's government in Arkansas.<br>
<p>
Larry "L D" Brown, a former member of Governor Clinton's security detail,<br>
recounts a mission to Mexico allegedly to kill a man who knew the state<br>
government was winking at weapons smuggling to the Nicaraguan Contras.<br>
<p>
The author writes: "Brown did not want to be on the wrong side of a<br>
house-cleaning operation by the CIA, so he accepted the mission."<br>
