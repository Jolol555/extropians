I already did the guns-discussion once on this list so I've stayed out of<br>
it so far. I feel obliged to make a few comments here however, after this<br>
I'll start preparing for my X-mas/newyear trip in the Alps.<br>

<p>
I'm certainly no legal expert but my rights of free speech, assembly, a<br>
fair trail, legal representation and so on are guaranteed by the Dutch<br>
constitution.<br>
If a group of politicians or the Monarchy ever tried to seize power they<br>
simply would not get any cooperation from the police or the military<br>
because those are the same citizens that democratically voted a<br>
social-democrat into power. They live in the same neighborhoods as the<br>
people who's rights they would be trampling. Their children go to the same<br>
schools as the children of their new 'political enemies' (everybody else).<br>
The fine-tuned machine of our economy would grind to a halt very quickly.<br>
They are also sworn to defend the principles and rights as stated in the<br>
constitution (and not The Queen or such).<br>
<p>
We have a Queen because we like it that way, she's a nice person, wears<br>
funny hats and relieves our governement officals from a lot of ribbon<br>
cutting and such so they can get on with their work. She also attracts a<br>
lot of tourist revenue and has no real political power (and that is the way<br>
it should be).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Non-AMericans just can't seem to understand how importatant this</i><br>
<i> &gt;prinicple is, nor do many americans today. People think that if the</i><br>
<i> &gt;government observes a particular political right of the people as a</i><br>
<i> &gt;matter of form even though it is not legally bound to, that the people</i><br>
<i> &gt;actually, legally, posess this freedom. Not so. And I am not sorry to be</i><br>
<i> &gt;delivering this wakeup call, no matter how much you might deny or resist</i><br>
<i> &gt;its validity.</i><br>
<p>
But aside from legal issues, let's look at the practical implementations.<br>
<p>
In the Netherlands:<br>
<p>
- I can have a beer or any other drink in any bar from the age of 16.<br>
- I can drive a car from the age of 18.<br>
- I can use almost any drug without fear of gov retaliation of any kind.<br>
- Women can get an abortion if they so wish without having to fear<br>
retaliation from religious right groups<br>
- I can legally take control to end my life if I'm terminally ill.<br>
- I can walk right up to the a MP, Minister or the Premier to ask a question.<br>
- I can own most types of firearms for sporting purposes (no full-auto's).<br>
- I won't have to be afraid of SWAT's BATF's or other dark forces (there<br>
has never been a situation like Waco or Ruby Ridge in this century).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I understand, In the US:</i><br>
<p>
- I can't go to a bar 'till I'm 21.<br>
- I can drive a car from the age of 16.<br>
- I can get arrested for just owning some Pot, Coke or Synthetic drugs.<br>
- I have to fear the FBI, CIA, DAI, NSA, BATF, IRS and a score of other<br>
agency's<br>
- I have a 10 - 30 times greater chance of being killed (depending on how<br>
you interpret the statistics) compare to most European countries.<br>
- I can own most guns in most states (except full-auto's), and carry<br>
concealed (with a license).<br>
<p>
So what's this freedom everybody is talking about?<br>
As I have stated before, our little neck of the woods is far from perfect<br>
but even if only half the stories that I read on this list are true it's<br>
the Americans living in a police state, not me.<br>
<p>
I just re-read the article 'Amerika, Amerika' that was posted a few days<br>
ago and it makes me sad. If it's true Americans are living in a totally<br>
rotten police state which must be awful. If it's not true the lack of<br>
mutual trust and cohesion in American society is aparently so low that the<br>
term 'society' may not be apliccable any longer. Just some people sharing a<br>
language and a currency, a country going to pieces (that's BAD - remember<br>
Yugoslavia?).<br>
<p>
It's a shitty situation any way you look at it.<br>
<p>
Instead of worrying about the right to pack a .44 magnum when you're taking<br>
a shower maybe it would be prudent to think about what it is about US<br>
society that makes it neccesary to do so (as opposed to various other<br>
countries). As Kathry stated: The guns should just be a temporary fix<br>
untill we can find some better way of _structurally preventing_ violence.<br>
It seems to have worked here to great extend (guns are a fairly non-issue<br>
in Holland) in spite of our much higher pop.density, cultural and racial<br>
diversity and lower standard of living compared to the US.<br>
<p>
<p>
And BTW, I used to legally own a rifle (.308), it was for keeping the polar<br>
bears away when traveling in the Arctic. I never needed to fire it at<br>
anything living, most polar bears seem to prefer seals to funny-smelling<br>
tourists ;-). I would still own it if I would have continued those kind of<br>
trips, maybe in a few years...<br>
<p>
You have fun with your SKS Anton, I hope you won't ever have to shoot<br>
anything that has a greater than 75% genetic resemblance with yourself.<br>
<p>
Wishing everybody a peacefull X-mas and a healty, Extropic newyear!<br>
