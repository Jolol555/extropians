I also thought the definition of "connected" was wrong.  I don't count because<br>
I don't have a beeper, but couldn't live without my laptop, a steady e-mail<br>
connection and a cell phone glued to my ear.  Go figure.<br>
<p>
I believe the survey is important because it is a relatively well thought-out<br>
set of questions filtered through at least some proxy for advanced telecom<br>
usage, yielding a picture of the social and political attitudes of such<br>
people.  The thing I found most interesting was the extent to which those<br>
attitudes did and did not reflect extropian values: The survey's "connecteds"<br>
seem to be fairly libertarian on issues of personal liberty and capitalism,<br>
but still seemed to have an abiding faith in existing political institutions<br>
AND were, in the majority, practicing religionists.<br>
