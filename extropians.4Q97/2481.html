I think Laser cooling would be much more practical, temperatures about that <br>
low have already been reached with it, it's how a Bose Einstein condensate  <br>
was made a few years ago. It's not easy and has only been done over a small <br>
area, but with Quantum Dot Lasers in the wings that will certainly improve. <br>
<p>
The idea is to tune a Laser beam to a frequency slightly below the quantum  <br>
absorption  frequency of an atom, if the atom is motionless or moving away <br>
from the Laser it will not be able to absorb a photon from the Laser, but if <br>
the atom is moving toward the Laser the frequency of the photon that the atom <br>
sees will be shifted slightly higher due to the Doppler effect. The photon is<br>
now right at the quantum absorption frequency, the atom will swallow it whole <br>
including the momentum of the photon, this will slow the atom down. <br>
<p>
Yes, now that the atom is excited and no longer in its ground state <br>
eventually the atom will re emit the photon, but the direction is random, <br>
it's just as likely to cool the atom further as heat it, so this has no net <br>
effect on the cooling process. If you have 6 such Laser beams one for, <br>
forward, backward, right, left, up, down, you can cool things to very close <br>
to absolute zero. <br>
