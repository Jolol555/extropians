ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART VI<br>
<p>
<p>
IRS, Schiff, and Economic Freedom<br>
=================================<br>
<p>

Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
This is the sixth in a series of articles on the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first five articles<br>
are available at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
The emphasis of the Economic Means to Freedom is on:<br>
(a) Building freedom, rather than "fighting tyranny"<br>
or "fighting for freedom";<br>
(b) Bringing about a massive shift of economic power<br>
into the hands of individuals.<br>
<p>
This article deals with my seventh principle of the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom: Exit tax systems to the<br>
extent you can do so legally -- with an acceptable<br>
level of risk; and the eighth principle: Terrocrats<br>
(coercive political agents or terrorist bureaucrats)<br>
are neither omniscient nor omnipotent.<br>

Irwin Schiff's 'PUBLIC NOTICE'<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
The following paid advertisement appeared in the<br>
'Las Vegas Review-Journal' of November 6, 1997:<br>
<p>
Irwin Schiff<br>
<p>
620 South 11th St. Suite 7<br>
Las Vegas, Nevada 89101<br>
(702) 385-6920<br>
FAX (702) 385-6917<br>
Web Site: <a href="http://www.ischiff.com">http://www.ischiff.com</a><br>
<p>
<p>
An open letter to:<br>
<p>
<p>
U.S. Senator Harry Reid<br>
U.S. Senator Richard Bryan<br>
Congressman John Ensign<br>
Congressman Jim Gibbons<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Honorable Gentlemen,<br>
<p>
During the last 20 years I have been exposing -<br>
in numerous books, publications, lectures and<br>
litigation - the unlawful activities of the l.R.S.<br>
I have also, during this time, developed procedures<br>
that allow Americans to protect themselves from<br>
such I.R.S./government behavior.  Essentially, I<br>
have been doing your job which is to protect the<br>
constitutional rights of your constituents - a<br>
task for which you took a sworn oath.  In conformity<br>
with that oath, l would ask you just one question,<br>
"Are there specific laws making Americans 'liable'<br>
for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes?"<br>
<p>
I am herein requesting that you, individually or<br>
collectively, provide me and your constituents with<br>
the date and time when you would be available to<br>
appear at a Town Hall meeting to be held in Las<br>
Vegas, where you would identify those laws which<br>
specifically make Americans 'liable' for and/or<br>
requiring them 'to pay' income taxes.  If no such<br>
laws exist, then there is no reason why Americans<br>
should sustain the kind of I.R.S. harassment and<br>
abuse recently documented on "60 Minutes" and<br>
revealed in the recent Senate hearings.<br>
<p>
I will assume all costs for the Town Hall meeting<br>
and further agree to pay $50,000.00 to any charity<br>
of your choice, if you can cite the specific laws<br>
as requested above.<br>
<p>
Looking forward to your immediate reply,<br>
<p>
Constitutionally yours,<br>
<p>
(signed)<br>

Terrocrats are Neither Omniscient Nor Omnipotent<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The eighth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
is that terrocrats and their systems are often laughingly<br>
incompetent and inefficient.  I don't think the IRS is any<br>
exception!  There are millions of people who don't pay and<br>
who don't get in trouble.<br>
<p>
As an informed individual, your chances of beating the IRS<br>
are very high.  Tax attorney Donald W. MacPherson ('Tax Fraud<br>
&amp; Evasion: The War Stories' -- 1-800-BEAT-IRS) calculates<br>
the chances of an individual being prosecuted in any given<br>
year being about 1 in 70,000; and the chances of being<br>
jailed at 1 in 146,000.  As a general rule, the IRS goes<br>
after the "easy pickings."<br>
<p>
In reality you don't deal with the "IRS monster," but with<br>
individual bureaucrats -- often not the most competent<br>
individuals.  Once you know the major weaknesses of the IRS<br>
-- the soft belly of the monster -- you have little to fear.<br>
You don't have to passively submit to their "taxtortion."<br>
To the informed individual, the IRS may be a paper tiger.<br>
<p>
The year 2000 date problem may spell the death knell of the<br>
IRS as it is now constituted.  Not only do they have to<br>
review 62 million lines of computer program code, they<br>
almost certainly have to reformat hundreds of computer<br>
files and data bases.  And they almost certainly have to<br>
write programs to convert their data.<br>
<p>
But some of the IRS terrocrats do carry guns, and they can<br>
be vicious and capricious.  Some of them are probably quite<br>
sadistic and may enjoy destroying your business and/or your<br>
life.  So you have to be very careful!<br>
<p>
The website &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt; contains a wealth<br>
of information on dealing with bureaucrats, including<br>
"taxtortionists."<br>
<p>
<p>
Is the IRS Dead?<br>
----------------<br>
<p>
"Under cross-examination by nationally prominent tax attorney<br>
Lowell H. Becraft, Jr., Ms. Jeu (expert IRS witness) conceded<br>
that the IRS uses a secret code to classify people.  Mr. Long<br>
(the defendant) was classified by the secret code of the IRS<br>
as not liable to file a tax return or pay income tax."<br>
-- Recent landmark tax case lost by IRS --<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
<p>
Many Americans May Not Be Liable for Federal Income Tax!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
In the above amazing court case the jury agreed with the<br>
defendant -- prosecuted for willful failure to file income<br>
tax returns for 1989 and 1990 -- that the "income tax" is<br>
actually an excise tax and applies only to certain classes<br>
of people.<br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe Neither You Nor Your Business Is Liable!<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Imagine what your life or business would be like if you<br>
didn't have to keep records for the IRS, if you didn't<br>
have to file tax returns, if you didn't have to pay the<br>
IRS, if you didn't have to fear IRS audits.  Maybe there<br>
are practical ways to effectively eliminate the IRS from<br>
your life and reduce the risk to almost zero!<br>
<p>
<p>
What If The IRS Runs on 90% Bluff, 10% Terror, and 0% Substance?<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Maybe through Freedom Technology &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com">http://www.buildfreedom.com</a>&gt;<br>
you can acquire the KNOWLEDGE and PERSONAL POWER to call<br>
their bluff, deflect their terror, and render them harmless<br>
to you.<br>
<p>
Many people will agree that one of the biggest indignities<br>
they suffer is having to deal with the IRS.  Of course, most<br>
of all, the IRS hurts our pockets.  Fortunately the IRS can<br>
be defeated, as happened in the landmark case mentioned above<br>
and described in 'Report #TL16F: The Becraft Landmark Case'<br>

Safeguarding Yourself<br>
---------------------<br>
<p>
Good-Faith Reliance Defense -- You have Sovereign<br>
Individual Rights when it comes to taxes.  What if<br>
you honestly can conclude in good faith, based on<br>
expert legal advice and U.S. Supreme Court decisions,<br>
that you personally have no obligation to file returns<br>
and pay income taxes?<br>
<p>
Of course, everyone should obey the law.  Anyone who<br>
is liable to file and pay income taxes should do so.<br>
But what if you personally come to the good-faith<br>
decision that such statutes do not apply to you?<br>
<p>
What we mean, in part, by Freedom Technology is<br>
practical methods by which to live free.  What if<br>
there exists a proven, lawful method for you be free<br>
from many taxes?<br>
<p>
Many freedom groups through the years have offered<br>
information on tax freedom.  Some of the methods<br>
advocated, while interesting, probably are<br>
not always effective.  I believe the Reliance<br>
Defense Method, properly applied in good faith,<br>
is one of the most effective tax freedom strategies<br>
yet devised.  It is based on U.S. Supreme Court<br>
decisions such as Cheek v U.S., 111 S.Ct. 604 (1991).<br>
<p>
The Cheek decision says, in pertinent part: "If the<br>
defendant had a subjective good faith belief, no<br>
matter how unreasonable, that he was not required<br>
to file a tax return, the government cannot establish<br>
that the defendant acted willfully."  The Reliance<br>
Defense Method is covered in detail in 'Report #TL16G'<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl16g.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl16g.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Most people can probably save 1000's of dollars per<br>
year with this method.  Some people can likely save<br>
tens of thousands of dollars per year.  Now, it should<br>
be noted that all actions you take must be in good faith.<br>
This means you should never call yourself a "tax protester"<br>
or say that you don't have to obey the law; these statements<br>
would demonstrate bad faith.<br>
<p>
You do not challenge the right of the Legislature to<br>
pass tax statutes and regulations.  But, if after<br>
(1) getting advice letters from licensed attorneys and<br>
CPA's and (2) studying U.S. Supreme Court decisions<br>
yourself, you come personally to the honest, good faith<br>
subjective belief that you personally are not required<br>
to file and pay, you're in a position of power.  This<br>
method has proven itself -- when properly applied.<br>
<p>
The most important element of the Reliance Defense Method<br>
is that you must have at least one letter from an attorney,<br>
licensed at the time of writing the letter, addressed to<br>
you personally.  In general, appellate courts have held<br>
that reliance on an attorney's professional advice (or<br>
U.S. Supreme Court decisions) absolutely shows good faith<br>
as a matter of law.  'Report TL16G' contains a listing of<br>
attorneys and CPA's willing to write such opinion letters<br>
for you, personally.<br>
<p>
If you would like to know the bottom line of why this method<br>
is so powerful even though the tax man hates it: If you truly<br>
in good faith believe, based on expert legal advice that you<br>
don't have to file, then it doesn't even matter whether it<br>
was a reasonable belief or not!  You beat the IRS because ALL<br>
YOU HAVE TO SHOW IS THAT YOU HONESTLY IN GOOD FAITH BELIEVED<br>
THE EXPERT ADVICE.  This is quite effective -- all you need<br>
to learn is HOW to study and obtain advice such that you<br>
might be able to reach and hold such honest good-faith beliefs.<br>
<p>
Note that, in his advertisement above, Irwin Schiff is offering<br>
$50,000.00 to charity, if the "honorable gentlemen" addressed<br>
are able to cite any "specific laws making Americans 'liable'<br>
for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes."<br>
<p>
Such studying and obtaining advice is a brilliant application<br>
of Individual Sovereignty that you can apply right now.  The<br>
methodology meshes perfectly with my emphasis on Personal Power<br>
-- 'Report #TL10' &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm</a>&gt; --<br>
in which you exercise your own personal solutions, rather than<br>
try to change the beliefs of others.  After all, all that<br>
matters for you personally  to use this method is that you<br>
develop a good-faith personal belief concerning the tax<br>
man.  And the real bottom line is that the probability is<br>
high that you can make it work for you!<br>
<p>
There are a number of people like Irwin Schiff, who advocate<br>
a range of different approaches to dealing with the IRS.<br>
Any of these approaches can be considerably strengthened<br>
by bolstering them with the Reliance Defense Method.<br>
<p>
You simply cannot afford to miss out on this powerful<br>
application of Freedom Technology!<br>
