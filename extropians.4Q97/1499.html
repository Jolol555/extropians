Of course, if a program ever did that, it would need to be in the<br>
Licence agreement you read (make sure you look those over) You never<br>
acutally buy software. You buy the right to use it.<br>

<i>&gt; Good points.</i><br>

<i>&gt; On Fri, 14 Nov 1997 20:10:49 -0600, Ryan Marsh &lt;ryanm@wl.net&gt; said to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Christopher Whipple' &lt;byteboy@simons-rock.edu&gt;:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As for MS products checking for piracy, I haven't been able to prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;any current</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;products do what he said but it is possible to include that kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;functionality.  I am glad that MS</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would do such a thing.  Piracy is illegal is he supporting crime?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, I am not supporting crime.  In fact, I was speaking out against</i><br>
<i>&gt; programs that copy data from my computer without permission and transmits</i><br>
<i>&gt; it over the network.  I also was speaking out against programs that</i><br>
<i>&gt; misrepresent themselves as a different program to try to gain unauthorized</i><br>
<i>&gt; access to other computers over the network.  You mistakenly assume that if</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't trust Microsoft to do anything it wants on my computer without my</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge or permission, that I must have something to hide from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As for serving graphics incorrectly to Navigator, let me say the Netscape</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Navigator is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;most unreliable pieces of software that I have ever used.[....]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I never mentioned Netscape Navigator.  You mistakenly assume that if I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a single negative point about Microsoft Internet Explorer, that I must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-Microsoft and pro-Netscape in the browser arena.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As for Wintel vs. Apple[....]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I merely objected to your claim that Macintoshes are *twice* as costly as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the equivalent PC.  You mistakenly assumed that I was therefore anti-PC and</i><br>
<i>&gt; pro-Mac.  I tried to clear this up by pointing out that I have more PC's</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Unixes in my home lab than Macs, and that I provide major consulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; for IBM.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That's the biggest load of bullshit that I have ever heard. His mind is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;brainwashed by the Rebel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Alliance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [....]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And last but not least, MS is a great company, honest. I have worked with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their guys on several</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;projects and I enjoy it everytime I do. They are extremely professional,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perfectionists, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have THE BEST coders I have ever run across in my entire life.  Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is aggressive and smart.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Do any of us remember the mistake that Bill made about denouncing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Internet?  Now look at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their position on it, people are scared MS will take over.  Also, take a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;look at how MS used kiss</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Apple's ass. Apple had the potential to become what MS is today. It's all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about make good business</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;decisions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are the one caught up in the propoganda.  Your entire post has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; responding to points I never made.  You are having a war with an imaginary</i><br>
<i>&gt; opponent.  I am not engaged in this argument, nor do I intend to be.</i><br>
