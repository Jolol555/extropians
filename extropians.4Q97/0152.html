our<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
I doubt this.  I think it's more likely that our<br>
numbers constitute our attempt to *describe* the<br>
universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Human evolution is against complex numbers.  They form no part of the human</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind.  They are foreign to us, external to our selves, our goals, and our</i><br>
<i>&gt;natures, external to the regularities which forged the reality we now call</i><br>
<i>&gt;Real Life.  And yet the true laws, the Laws of Physics, tick on regardless. </i><br>
<i>&gt;We were not consulted, and our opinions have no effect on What Is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I suspect that what you call "true laws, the Laws<br>
of Physics," constitute more or less useful opinions<br>
-- again, attempts to *describe*.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This, I believe, holds true of ethics.  Right and wrong are objective facts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and not facts which we or *any* volitional agent were consulted about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I think "right and wrong" constitute *descriptions*,<br>
possibly with a reliability that can sometimes be<br>
estimated quite accurately, that certain behaviors<br>
can be predicted to produce certain consequences.<br>
<p>
They could be regarded as heuristics or rules of<br>
thumb.  As we develop and evolve we improve them.<br>
<p>
All our ideas, concepts, words, numbers, and other<br>
symbols *and their meanings* are our creations.  We<br>
hope they reflect or represent aspects of reality<br>
in a useful manner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What we are evolved to regard as "right" is as irrelevant as the numbers we</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolved to see as "real".  True right and wrong are outside of our opinions</i><br>
<i>&gt;and unaffected by them.  And nobody knows what right and wrong truly are,</i><br>
<i>&gt;INCLUDING me!  When asked an ethical question, we are in the same position as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a Newtonian physicist asked the true nature of time.  We can't possibly</i><br>
get it<br>
<i>&gt;right; we must simply avoid all questions of "true natures" and go with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;best guess we can make.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyway, that's why I keep on having trouble in discussing this with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;members of this List.  You keep on talking about evolution, and about what</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt;think.  But that's irrelevant.  You and I can no more affect right and wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;that way than we can flatten the Earth.  Humans were not consulted here.</i><br>
<p>
If you argue that what others think or say<br>
about "right and wrong" is irrelevant, then<br>
-- unless you have superior ability to think<br>
and say -- it seems to me that you have to<br>
also conclude that whatever you think or say<br>
about "right and wrong" is equally irrelevant.<br>
<p>
Surely, your notion that, "Right and wrong are<br>
objective facts..." is just what you think and<br>
say?<br>
