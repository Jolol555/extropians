IT_COULDN'T_BE_DONE<br>
<p>
Somebody said that it couldn't be done,<br>
But he with a chuckle replied<br>
That "maybe it couldn't", but he would be one<br>
Who wouldn't say so till he tried.<br>
So he buckled right in with a trace of a grin<br>
On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing, <br>
That couldn't be done and he did it.<br>
<p>
Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that;<br>
At least no one ever has done it";<br>
But he took off his coat and he took of his hat,<br>
And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.<br>
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br>
Without any doubting or quiddit,<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br>
That couldn't be done, and he did it.<br>
<p>
There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br>
There are thousands to prophesy failure;<br>
There are thousands to point out to you, one by one,<br>
The dangers that wait to assail you.<br>
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin<br>
Just take off your coat and go to it.<br>
Just start to sing as you tackle the thing<br>
That "cannot be done," and you'll do it.<br>
