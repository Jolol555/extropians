Say what! What on earth are you talking about?  What is it you imagine that<br>
I "know perfectly well?" Until your post, I had never heard of "Lord<br>
Kalvan", nor "Otherwhen", nor "All the Myraid Ways."<br>
As for, &gt; and even though counterfactual processes are built into the basic <br>

Schrodinger &gt;       &gt;equation and linear evolution).<br>
<p>
I haven't heard of this before either. What is it supposed to mean? I don't<br>
know and considering terminology like "counterfactual processes" seriously<br>
doubt that anyone else does either. I don't know what your problem is,<br>
fella, but you sure have me mixed up with a lot of things that ain't me.<br>
<p>
snip<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wrong.  My version was altered from yours almost verbatim, maintained most of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the phrasing, and did not alter any meaning except substituting "reality"</i><br>
for "morality".<br>
<p>
"substituting 'reality for morality'? And you see nothing wrong with this? I<br>
consistently use the term objective as in objective reality as the real and<br>
basis for all truth. I clearly and emphatically stated again and again that<br>
"objective morality" is myth. Opposites, right? So, you take my position of<br>
objective reality as all truth and exchange it for my position of "objective<br>
morality" as no truth and see nothing wrong with the 180 shift of my actual<br>
position. You call this "paraphrasing?" I think I need to call a linguistic<br>
paramedic because you sure have butchered the hell out of my words. Did you<br>
read "The Anatomy Of Language" as I suggested? My language usage is directed<br>
by the principles cited therein. To disregard these principles of definition<br>
and presume to rearrange my words in any order or disorder you choose, and<br>
still imagine it represents my beliefs and arguments is ludicrous.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I am not debating with someone who mysteriously forgets what the term</i><br>
<i>&gt;"objective morality" means after starting an attack on it.</i><br>
<p>
I sure didn't 'forget' and imagine that objective reality (real) and<br>
"objective morality"(myth) are the same thing. Somebody did. Guess who.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference between analyzing a definition and pretending not to understand it.</i><br>
<p>
Definitions are my forte.  See the book.  So you don't want to debate with<br>
me anymore. That's great, but considering your "paraphrasing" and other<br>
random attributing to my position, I don't see that you have EVER debated<br>
with me.<br>
