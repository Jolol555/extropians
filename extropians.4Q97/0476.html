<i>&gt; &gt;Where I depart from Mr. England is that while we agree that we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rationaly derive moral values, he then tries to derive moral values</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from that failure--even more irrational.  He says, in effect, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;since your morals cannot be rational, be less judgmental of others</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and less committed to your own. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Judging from a couple of your posts, I thought you would be inclined to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand my presentations more than some of the others. With no disrespect</i><br>
<i>&gt; intended, I sadly say I was mistaken. Numerous times in my posts, I stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite clearly and uniquovically that I reject the concept, morality, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; myth. What was it in my post that led you to conclude that I really didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean it, that I was must be  promoting my own brand of "morality?"</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From your post of October 9:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; entirely eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; scientific terms would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of a thing or situation.</i><br>
<p>
That sounds like a moral prescription to me, and if it sounds like a<br>
duck, and walks like a duck, your insistence that it's not a duck<br>
doesn't impress me.<br>
<p>
Like you, I utterly reject all claims I have seen of a supposed is-<br>
ought bridge; I have no evidence on which to decide whether, as you<br>
claim, it is because such a thing /can't/ exist, or whether. as Eli<br>
claims, it does exist and we just haven't found it or are incapable<br>
of finding it.<br>
<p>
But it doesn't really make much difference to me.  I'm not attached<br>
to this failure, it's just part of what is, no more and no less than<br>
the fact that dogs have four legs.  There's no objective morality.<br>
Big deal--I can get on with my chosen one just fine, thank you.<br>
I don't know what important revelation you might be communicating<br>
that you don't think I've gotten, but from your copious words so far,<br>
it's nothing more than I knew a year ago.  There's no objective<br>
morality.  You're right.  So what?  Any reaction you would have me<br>
make from that is just your own normative preference, and I'm no more<br>
interested in your values than God's.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;irrelevant to everyday use.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then so is individualism and freedom. </i><br>
<p>
If you mean "convincing the world that individualism and freedom<br>
are the right thing", then yes, they're just as irrelevant.  If you<br>
mean convincing them of it so they'll stay out of my way, that's<br>
important to me, because I want them out of my way--and even better<br>
if they cooperate.  But I don't care one whit whether they do it<br>
because it's "right" or not, only that they do it.<br>
