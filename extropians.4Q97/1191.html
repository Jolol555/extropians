      I occasionally see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel on <br>

<p>
      John, here's a reprise of my school-days odyssey...<br>
<p>
      I grew up uner the shadows of thermonuclear weapons, and as a kid, I <br>
      depserately wanted to get (some of) us off the planet, and into some <br>
      sort of open future off-world.  I read a lot of science fiction, and <br>
      -- as I read the stories -- thought on three levels:<br>
<p>
      [1] Is this idea physically and technically possible?<br>
<p>
      [2] If not, how near can we get to it?<br>
<p>
      [3] If we can't do it, what can we do which will achieve the same <br>
      purpose?<br>
<p>
<p>
      Aged 11, despite various barbarisms (ferinstance, being repeatedly <br>
      caned on the outstretched fingers of my left hand, in a - failed - <br>
      attempt to make me right-handed), I 'won' the top scholarship in my <br>
      primary school, despite only three years of formal education.  (I <br>
      was near-autistic for a while -- I used to 'disappear' into books <br>
      and their 'alternative universes' for hours and days on end).<br>
<p>
      Read Alice Miller, "For Your Own Good", on the horrors of <br>
      contemporary pedagogy...<br>
<p>
      At my Dulwich College entrance interview, I was asked by the <br>
      headmaster what I wanted to do.<br>
<p>
      I replied honestly: "I want to be a rocket scientist, and get us off <br>
      this planet."<br>
<p>
      I was told that there would be no rockets; therefore, there would be <br>
      no rocket scientists; and that I would instead be made into a a <br>
      _lawyer_... <br>
<p>
      This -- to me -- stated: "There will _be no future_."<br>
<p>
      (You will notice that the 'United Kingdom' now has no space <br>
      programme, except for a small piece of Arianespace; oh, and some <br>
      militarily useless American Trident missiles, dependent on -- <br>
      American -- terminal guidance).<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      Still, I persevered.  In the -- hopelessly ineptly-taught -- physics <br>
      classes, it was clear that we were being taught _obsolete rubbish_.  <br>
      Equally clearly;  if I wanted to get bits of paper ('credentials') <br>
      to be an engineer or physicist, I had to (learn to) absorb and <br>
      regurgitate their absurdities.<br>
<p>
      Worse:  the moment the 'authorities' spotted that you _wanted <br>
      something from them_, they used that to _control you_.  I didn't <br>
      want to be 'controlled'...  Among the methods of 'control' were <br>
      savage and protracted beatings (often in front of invited audiences, <br>
      who got their 'jollies' from watching avidly, while they did rude <br>
      things to themselves 'discreetly' under newspapers); endless  <br>
      'detentions' (that is, three hour imprisonments); and physical <br>
      ordeals of various kinds (five mile runs after lessons, etc. etc.).<br>
<p>
      I was 'suspended' seven times, and 'asked to leave' _twice_ (a <br>
      record of sorts, I understand!).  On the final occasion, aged <br>
      sixteen [1958], I was ordered to cut up sheets of newsprint with a <br>
      blunt pair of scissors, for use in experiments tracing the paths of <br>
      light through glass blocks, using pins as line-of-sight markers.<br>
<p>
      [ FX: "Pinlighting is a hell of a way to earn a living..." ]<br>
<p>
      True story: In frustration, I hauled out my bright, shiny 11" bladed <br>
      Bowie knife, and hacked the paper into handy-sized pieces...  The <br>
      physics teacher (one Mr. Tapper -- "One Nation under Surveillance, <br>
      with Wiretaps and Mail Covers for All"), turned white, summoned me <br>
      into a box-room, and told me to discard this terrible instrument.  I <br>
      did so, but there was a hell of a 'clunk' as the matching holstered <br>
      .22 caliber pistol hit the shelf...  &gt;:-} ).<br>
<p>
      Later that day (one of the happiest of my life!)  I was told by my <br>
      Mum that Dulwich College had phoned, and had said that I would not <br>
      be returning to them. Victory!!!  "Free at last!!!"<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      So, you see, I don't really want you telling me I should read school <br>
      textbooks (i.e. prison instruction manuals -- just another <br>
      subjectivist 'argument from authority').  I have _already_ read too <br>
      many of them -- it's their _failures_ that played a large part in my <br>
      learning to use my _own_ intelligence. Indeed, it was &lt;inter alai&gt; <br>
      Jeremy Bernstein's -- utterly incompetent -- book on Einstein's <br>
      'Relativity' that stimulated me to _solve_ these problems for myself <br>
      -- and hopefully for others also.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;&gt;Me:          </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;&gt;The 2 slit interference experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Popper explains this neatly with propensities. Propensities are real         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;properties, albeit a little like 'hidden variables.'  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But there is no way Newton or Galileo of Faraday or Maxwell can explain this: Shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, even if the photons </i><br>
<i>&gt; are sent out one at a time. If a photon (or an electron) goes through one </i><br>
<i>&gt; slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go </i><br>
<i>&gt; though, was there or not, but it does!</i><br>
<p>
     The ballistic theory describes, predicts and explains interference. <br>
     Ballistic photons have _frequencies_ -- they're like tiny rotating <br>
     electric dipoles.  You _have_ to learn to understand this stuff. <br>
     Feynman can -- why the hell can't you?<br>
<p>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Don't tell me that all this is crazy because it's not my fault, I'm sure I  could have done much better but unfortunately I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; not given the job. Tell God He's crazy.             </i><br>
<p>
      I'm not telling you She's crazy.  I might ask you to be a bit less <br>
      credulous.  I have here a brilliant, glorious, funny book,  "Catching <br>
      the Light", Bantam, [1993], by Arthur Zajonc, Fulbright Scholar and <br>
      Professor of Physics at Amherst, which -- after a bewildering series <br>
      of polar flip-flops on the wave-or-particle nature of light issue -- <br>
      finally owns up, and tells us that all these 'quantum weirdness' <br>
      light phenomena only exhibit themseves with single-photon 'quantum' <br>
      light sources, which are very recent... atomic cascades, and <br>
      two-photon, parametric, down-conversion sources.  Don't try your <br>
      intellectual intimidation on me -- I _know_ all this stuff...<br>
      <br>
      I don't say it's impossible, but you might try to find a solid <br>
      citation for single-photon interference.  Obviously, you cannot <br>
      possibly demonstrate it with just one photon.  (This is obvious, <br>
      isn't it?)<br>
<p>
      And you might at least make an effort to understand the idea of <br>
      individual photons having inherent physical propensities (along with <br>
      velocity, polarization, mass, frequency, direction and intensity), <br>
      which govern their behaviour within the overall propensities of the <br>
      experimental situation.<br>
<p>
        <br>
<i>&gt; A word about philosophers; I like them, especially Popper, I always find that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of stuff entertaining, but Stephen Hawking has some amusing things to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; say about them that contain more than a little truth.</i><br>
<p>
      Here's Arthur Zajonc with a last word on the likes of Hawking:<br>
<p>
      "When we are confronted with the black void of pure instrumentalism, <br>
      the temptations of reactionary idolatry are very near.  Having lost <br>
      the Gods, we fall in love with the beautiful idols we can raise in <br>
      their places.  Atoms, quarks, tiny black holes... they are reified, <br>
      garlanded, and dragged forward to assume a place in the temple.  <br>
      Calling them real, we animate them with the false life of fear, our <br>
      fear of the unknown being of Nature."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Electrons only 'spiral into the nucleus' in aether theory.       </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newton says an object moving in a circle is accelerating toward the center of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the circle. Maxwell says an accelerating charge will radiate an </i><br>
<i>&gt; electromagnetic wave and give up energy. BUT...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An electron is a charge. The electron does not usually radiate an  </i><br>
<i>&gt; electromagnetic wave. The electron does not give up energy. The electron </i><br>
<i>&gt; does  not spiral into the nucleus.                 </i><br>
<p>
      Let me be more exact:  electrons in orbits around oppositely-charged <br>
      nuclei are in 'free-fall'; their _angular velocity_ is constant, <br>
      which is what matters for these purposes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;In Relational Mechanics, they're held in various orbits of </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;near-constant radius by electric force         </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The electron has a negative charge. </i><br>
<p>
      True.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The nucleus has a positive charge.       </i><br>
<p>
      True.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The electric force pulls the electron and nucleus together.</i><br>
<p>
      True.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The electron and nucleus do not come together. </i><br>
<p>
      True (usually, though check out neutrons).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Something else must be stopping them.        </i><br>
<p>
      "It's the inertia_, stupid!"  The goddamn photons have _intrinsic <br>
      mass_.  They're -- ipso facto -- subject to _gravitational force_.  <br>
      That's what 'ballistic' _means_, fer chrissake!<br>
<p>
     <br>
<i>        &gt;Relational Mechanics handles lasing easily.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the margin of your E mail message was too small to contain the marvelous </i><br>
<i>&gt; proof of it that you discovered.</i><br>
<p>
      The problem you stubbornly fail to grasp is that -- as David Collier <br>
      says -- to write a full history of light is to write out the history <br>
      of physics.  Light ties the whole subject-area together -- that's <br>
      why it's so difficult for some people to see different theories of <br>
      light and compare them.  It shakes the whole foundation of physics <br>
      as people understand it.  Makes them feel _insecure_.<br>
<p>
      You just tell me the bit in lasing that you think the ballistic <br>
      theory _doesn't_ explain.  Start with the standard quantum <br>
      explanation.  Don't ask me to post a book-length treatment of <br>
      lasers...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;      &gt;The Michelson-Morley experiment perfectly corroborates the ballistic         </i><br>
<i>&gt;      &gt;theory of light.  Doesn't everyone know  this?          </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, everyone doesn't know this.                </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
      Every half-way competent book on the subject acknowledges this.  <br>
      The light-source remains stationary with respect to the entire <br>
      apparatus.  The apparatus does not alter in its dimensions. <br>
      Therefore, the ballistic theory predicts that since there is no <br>
      shift in the length of the light-paths, nor any change in the <br>
      velocity of light within the apparatus, the interference fringes <br>
      will remain unchanged whatever the orientation in space of the <br>
      apparatus.  How simple can anything get?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Sheesh!!!  Gravitational redshift is perfectly predicted by the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;ballistic theory of light.          </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This said from a man who thinks a red filter produces a redshift.                </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;:-}  I was responding somewhat tongue-in-cheek to your 'Twilight </i><br>
        Zone' provocation...  "Red Skies at Night" kinda thing...<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The detection of gravity waves by Taylor and Hulse for which they         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;won the Nobel Prize in 1995.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But this is an _empirical_ matter   </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Rather a cavalier attitude to take toward experimental results from someone </i><br>
<i>&gt; who claims he's scientific don't you think.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
      You consistently fail to distinguish between Methodological <br>
      Scientific Research Programmes (like Relational Mechanics and <br>
      Quantum _theory_), and specific empirical questions, or auxilliary <br>
      hypotheses which are absorbed into the programme.  Relational <br>
      Mechanics handles it like this:<br>
<p>
      "If (and only if) gravitational force is propagated with a finite <br>
      velocity relative to its source, the paths of distant bodies will be <br>
      altered from the paths predicted by an instantaneously interacting <br>
      gravitational force."<br>
<p>
      It's so simple, yet so powerful.  Truly!  See it yet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;on which Relational Mechanics takes no position   </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then you've been beaten by the competition because General Relativity did </i><br>
<i>&gt; take a position, it predicted the gravity waves would exist and said exactly </i><br>
<i>&gt; how intense they'd be. Taylor and Hulse proved the prediction correct.  </i><br>
<p>
      (I think you'll find that's an overstatement of Einstein's position).<br>
<p>
      Relational Mechanics says: "If you want to find out the velocity of <br>
      propagation of gravity (if any), here's how to go about it."  It's <br>
      _immensely_ powerful, as well as beautiful.  You just don't seem to <br>
      see this, for reasons I might speculate upon sometime.  &gt;:-}.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; In my last post I mentioned the orbit of Mercury and said:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; " General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tony responded to my comment with the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;The point you insist on ignoring is that the velocity of propagation       </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;of gravitational force (if any) is not a feature of Classical or       </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;Relational Mechanics. In Newton's theory, gravity acts instantaneously       </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;at a distance (even though he also says that it doesn't, because that       </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;would have been 'occult' and could have gotten him executed).  Stop   </i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;conflating incompatible propositions, fer Chrissake!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's English, I recognize the words and it seems to obey the rules of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; grammar, but if anybody has an idea of what the above could mean I wish  </i><br>
<i>&gt; they'd drop me a line.</i><br>
<p>
     It doesn't get any simpler than this. It means that you can predict a <br>
     perihelion anomaly from a hypothesized finite velocity of propagation <br>
     of gravitational force;  AND:  that you can predict the velocity of <br>
     propagation of gravitational force back from the observed precession, <br>
     as compared to the predictions for instantaneous gravitational force <br>
     interaction.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Sheesh!!! Time is a _dimension_.  You never studied Dimensional         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Analysis?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; You say time is a dimension and you say it's a dimension that doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; measure anything. You might as well say time is a teapot. I'm going to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; repeat my question and see if you'll answer it this time, but you'll </i><br>
<i>&gt; probably just say "ballistic theory" has it all figured out or point to </i><br>
<i>&gt; another philosophy book.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If this thing you call "time" is not a measure of how particles of </i><br>
<i>&gt; matter and energy interact, such as the particles in my clock my body my </i><br>
<i>&gt; brain or my world, then why should I be the slightest bit interest in it?</i><br>
<p>
      Time is a _dimension_, a measure-ratio, a _metric for Duration_.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Here's Alfred O'Rahilly, Institute for Advanced Studies, Dublin<br>
<p>
      "In the case of short time-intervals we have a primitive perception <br>
      of equality and inequality just as we have for short <br>
      space-intervals.  This is especially noticeable in the case of <br>
      auditory rhythm, e.g. the sound of a clock ticking or of an engine <br>
      running or of a musical instrument playing....  <br>
<p>
      "Nowadays we measure long intervals by the periodic motions of the <br>
      heavenly bodies (rotation of the earth), and short intervals by <br>
      recurrent isochronous devices we may call clocks.  Here, as in other <br>
      cases such as that of temperature, we make successive refinements of <br>
      measurement by introducing corrections outside the previous limits <br>
      of accuracy.  For example, we make an immediate judgement that the <br>
      ordinary pendulum is isochronous, owing to the observed regularity <br>
      of its ticking.  With such a measure of time, we can verify the laws <br>
      of motion within the limits of experimental error.<br>
<p>
      "With more refined instruments we discover small residual errors <br>
      below the limits of the initial direct observation.  We can account <br>
      for this by advancing (1) supplementary hypotheses (disturbing <br>
      forces), or (2) a slight modification of the suopposed law, or (3) a <br>
      small discrepancy in the isochronism.<br>
<p>
      "In making a choice there is undoubtedly a mixture of convention with <br>
      observation.  But usually the probability is overwhelmingly in <br>
      favour of (3), so that the law keeps its original simple form and <br>
      yet accounts for apparent discrepancies without additional <br>
      hypotheses.  Our belief is corroborated if our improved clocks show <br>
      the laws to hold with a much higher degree of accuracy than that <br>
      with which we started.  There are in physics many examples of this <br>
      intensification of accuracy by successive corrections of a system of <br>
      measurement."<br>
