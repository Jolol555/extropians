It all depends on what you mean by free. <br>

WHo decides what are true costs and what is fabricated bullshit to con<br>
hard earned money out of working people????<br>

WHile the establishment scientists tend to support each other on<br>
warming, after decades of warning of an ice age, the majority of people<br>
still doubt that these simulations reflect reality. I am sitting here<br>
with over a foot of snow outside, that started accumulating earlier in<br>
November than at anytime in my life. We normally get at least a few rain<br>
storms here in nov-dec, but have yet to see one, its been too cold. I<br>
also know its colder because the deer migrated to lower altitudes much<br>
earlier than anyone can remeber since maybe the 50's.  While this is<br>
just one area, it is an indication that the Gulf Stream thermohaline<br>
conveyor system is weakening, as predicted, which could shut off the<br>
flow of heat to NE NA and northern europe, starting another pre-iceage<br>
trend.<br>
