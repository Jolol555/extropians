<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Well actually you probably consider that eastern Europe, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;western countries all still have militaries and armed citizens to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;some degree, perhaps you missed the recent post from one of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Dutch members?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Canada? Last time I checked you still had a military</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't think Jefferson was talking about militaries, and neither</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are the people in this thread.  The "armed" in this thread clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; refers to average citizens.  In that sense, the US citizenry is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; far more heavily armed than any other (first-world) country I'm aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of.  Certainly there are plenty of people in Western Europe and Canada</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with guns, but the percentage is far lower than in the US, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kinds of guns are generally different, too.  Fully automatic weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the military), and I suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the same is true for most of Western Europe.  (Correct me if I'm</i><br>
wrong.)<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;[Canada] not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;mention armed citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hardly anybody in Canada (percentage-wise) owns a gun.  I can only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think of one person, in all the people I know personally (including all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the not-so-close acquantences of my family), who owns a gun --- a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pistol.  I used to have many friends who had guns, but they were all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people who were involved with the Canadian military.  (I used to be in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.  I was on the rifle team.  I was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; top cadet marksman in southern Ontario.  It was fun, and some day I may</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; buy a rifle, but it's not high on my priority list.  So, you see, I</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nothing personally against guns, I'm just arguing your facts here.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;not to mention a rather large and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;extremely well armed neighbor to the south. If you think thats got</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;nothing to do with it, you're only kidding yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nothing to do with "it"?  What "it" are you refering to?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you mean that the reason some Canadians have guns is because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; US has lots of guns, I disagree.  Most Canadians will name "guns" as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one of the primary differences between Canadians and Americans.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Canadians that *do* own guns would probably do so regardless of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; armed-ness of the US.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, as I said, since it is clear to me that there exist countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; today that are substantially unarmed and also free and peaceful, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unclear that Jefferson's statement will be proved correct in the long</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; term.</i><br>
