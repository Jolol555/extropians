Interestingly enough we have another case of "Government Run Amok"...underway<br>
right now...and a gun is the only thing that has kept the poor woman<br>
alive...she fired a shotgun at the JackBootted thugs...and they are too<br>
cowardly to attack enmasse...reckon they'll call in Janet Reno and her<br>
gunships?<br>

<p>
        WASHINGTON, DC -- The Illinois state police should quit trying<br>
to "help" Shirley Allen -- before they kill her, the Libertarian Party<br>
says.<br>
<p>
        Allen is a 51-year-old widow in Roby, Illinois, who has held<br>
authorities at bay for an entire month in what has become the longest<br>
police standoff in state history. Police have surrounded her house and<br>
demanded that Allen -- who they say is "strange" -- submit at gunpoint<br>
to a psychiatric evaluation.<br>
<p>
<p>
and more...sadly and tragicly...much more follows...<br>

But I wouldn't think to much about it...when push comes to shove the<br>
government usely does all right....<br>

<p>
Right?<br>
