'The Case for Space Colonization'<br>
                    by Daniel Ust<br>
<p>
"There are at least two candidates for terraforming in our<br>
          solar system, Mars and Venus.....<br>
          One notion is the slow seeding of the target planet<br>
          with tailored organisms to make it more and more earthlike.<br>
          This can take a long time -- perhaps thousands of years. <br>
          Another proposal suggests using "fast and dirty" techniques<br>
          such as crashing comets or forcing volcanic eruptions with<br>
          nuclear bombs on Mars to make its atmosphere thicker."<br>
<p>
     Venus is probably the hardest terrrestrial planet to terraform, and<br>
will take <br>
the longest time. Most of its atmosphere has to be stripped off or<br>
sequestered <br>
first. Just cooling it down may take centuries. Its day is 243 Earth<br>
days long- not <br>
very useful, although possible to revise with orbital mirror-and-shade<br>
systems. <br>
It's a nasty place.<br>
     Mars is far and away the planet of choice, not only for early<br>
colonization <br>
with existing tech, but also for rapid terraformation processes.<br>
Crashing comets <br>
on Mars is probably quite unnecessary if you believe the higher end<br>
estimates <br>
for permafrost mass. There is probably enough water on Mars to cover the <br>
planet evenly to a depth of tens of meters, perhaps up to two hundred<br>
meters. It <br>
only needs to be thawed out.<br>
This might be done with geothermal heat pipes, replicated by the<br>
millions  (my <br>
proposal), simultaneously building up the atmosphere as well. This might<br>
only <br>
work one time, but that is all that is needed to bump Mars away from its<br>
cold <br>
cycle attractor.<br>
     Seeding  Mars with "organisms" need not take millennia- if you are<br>
willing to <br>
consider replicating machinery in this class. Depending on energy and <br>
hydrocarbon availability, as well as self-replication rates, this may<br>
take a little as <br>
_a few months_ to achieve a planet-wide shirt-sleeve environment. Mars<br>
also <br>
may have so-called "fossil  fuel" deposits similar to Earth's oil and<br>
natural gas <br>
reservoirs. If not, there are plenty of  carbonaceous asteroids to<br>
choose from, <br>
many resemble large blobs of coal tar.<br>
<p>
"The posthuman alternative is to redesign humans, either<br>
          through genetic engineering or by a machine-like fix such<br>
          as artificial lungs that can process Martian air."<br>
<p>
! The current Martian atmosphere is 99% CO2, useless for animal<br>
metabolism.<br>
<p>
        " This demands technology of a higher order than today....<br>
         We can easily imagine<br>
          someone adapted to a Martian habitat later being adapted to<br>
          suit a Titanian (after Saturn's big moon) one and so on. "<br>
<p>
This demand a far higher tech level than terraforming.<br>
<p>
          "Next, there's O'Neill-style colonization.  (Named after G.<br>
          K. O'Neill, "<br>
<p>
It bugs me to see a concept named after its popularizer.<br>
<p>
"...  Instead<br>
          of living in a space station, whether large or small, the<br>
          individual is redesigned to live in space by a melding of<br>
          space suit and organism or, in another scenario, to live in<br>
          space without a space suit.  This demands a higher level of<br>
          technology, but the roots of it can be seen in our present<br>
          technology."<br>
<p>
This is very much simpler to do than the planetary environment<br>
modifications.<br>
<p>
          "How will it be done?....<br>
          What modifications are necessary?  Current space stations<br>
          are designed for short crew rotations, not as permanent<br>
          homes. Reworking them will have to take this into account. "<br>
<p>
Current designs do not incorporate artificial gravity. This is a must<br>
for <br>
near-term permanent habitation. Modding existing would be very much<br>
harder <br>
than designing new.<br>
<p>
"To put it bluntly, since NASA isn't<br>
          footing the bill, efficiency is not its concern.  (David P.<br>
          Gump's Space Enterprise: Beyond NASA contains an inventory<br>
          of what is wrong with NASA along with some rather tame<br>
          proposals for reform.) "<br>
<p>
To put it even more bluntly, NASA has been the main obstacle to<br>
colonization <br>
for the past two decades. It is first and foremost a corporate welfare<br>
program. <br>
My reform proposals start with instant and total shutdown of the Space<br>
Shuttle <br>
program. Anyone who has anything to do with it should be thrown out on<br>
the <br>
street, and (most important) the records burned. Note this is not so<br>
different from<br>
what happened to the Apollo program.<br>
<p>
"To make things cheaper and more<br>
          efficient, the current space programs should be privatized<br>
          -- or at the very least laws restricting private enterprise<br>
          in space should be repealed."<br>
<p>
This is starting to happen after a fashion. There are more subtle forces<br>
to deal <br>
with that operate, in effect, outside of the law.<br>
<p>
"One plan<br>
          that is still being studied is to use colonies to build<br>
          solar power satellite stations (SSPS). These will supply<br>
          Earth with cheap electric power.  SSPSs would gather<br>
          sunlight, change it into microwaves and then beam these<br>
          down to collecting antennas on Earth's surface"<br>
<p>
This has been studied since the late '60s, it is just now starting to<br>
make economic <br>
sense. The primary obstacle was and is high launch costs (c.f. NASA).<br>
<p>
        "  Moving manufacturing to space is yet another payoff<br>
colonists can give to surface dwellers.  This would not<br>
          only lessen the pollution impact and the land use of<br>
          factories but could possibly eliminate mining on Earth too."<br>
<p>
Mining asteroids will, IMO, completely eliminate Earth mining. The ore<br>
quality <br>
is very much higher, and delivery will be very much cheaper, once an <br>
infrastructure is in place.<br>
See "The Interworld Rapid Transit System (A Transportation Network for<br>
the <br>
Solar System)"<br>
for some ideas on how to do this. The abstract is at<br>
<a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb">http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb</a><br>
The draft article should show up fairly soon. Also, Robert Forward's<br>
company, <br>
Tethers Unlimited, is working on a linked tether system for Earth-Moon <br>
transportation using lunar dirt as the mass and energy source.  This<br>
system can <br>
be enhanced to provide transport to near-Earth asteroids.<br>
<p>
        "  Who will call the shots? Most of today's space activities,<br>
          from launching communications satellites to planetary<br>
          exploration, are done by government funded and run space<br>
          programs."<br>
<p>
This may not be true anymore. Teledesic, Iridium, NEAP, and others are<br>
all <br>
private efforts. The number of LEO satellites involved is of the same<br>
order as <br>
the number of .gov sat launches.<br>
<p>
"....  Given that the larger<br>
          corporations tend to operate hand-in-hand with the<br>
          government -- often to curtail competition and to get<br>
          subsidies -- this might be a problem.  The solution, for<br>
          those interested in making sure the high frontier is a free<br>
          one, is to try to drive government out of space.  The less<br>
          government there is up there, the fewer favors there are to<br>
          be handed out."<br>
<p>
Agreed. Elements in the US gov in particular seem to be operating under<br>
the <br>
delusion that they own outer space. See G. Harry Stine's "Halfway to <br>
Anywhere" for some horror stories.<br>
<p>
" ...On Earth,<br>
          as better transportation technologies become available (in<br>
          the past, these included trains, planes, and automobiles)<br>
          because of the limited space centralized control has been<br>
          enhanced..."<br>
<p>
Safety and standardization were central motives of gov regulation. Some<br>
of this also applies to my "Interworld" proposal, unfortunately.<br>
<p>
"...          As an example of how space can become really cheap, look<br>
at<br>
          all the Cold War ICBMs stockpiled.  Currently, there's talk<br>
          of destroying them outright, but wouldn't it be better to<br>
          sell them as space vehicles?  "<br>
<p>
The private Conestoga rocket of the early '80s was made from a Minuteman<br>
booster. The company was destroyed  by someone who notified some obscure<br>
gov agency that dealt with export law. The spent booster landed in the <br>
Caribbean, outside US territorial waters  and was, you see, a form of<br>
"exporting <br>
munitions".<br>
