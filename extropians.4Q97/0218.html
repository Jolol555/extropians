Well, "psychological tools" covers a very broad territory.  Which<br>
psychological tools were you interested in discussing?<br>
<p>
There are extensive online discussion groups for investing, though<br>
that does get discussed on this list from time to time, it's a big<br>
(and mighty contentious) subject.  I tend to like what Harry<br>
Browne wrote on the subject before he lost his marbles and went<br>
into politics (half-kidding, there), but the last couple of<br>
times I brought it up on the list, it didn't seem to meet with<br>
much approval or interest.  Apparently, many of Browne's ideas<br>
about investing are considered crackpottish, even among<br>
extropians.  ;)  And all of his advice is heavily slanted<br>
toward North Americans.<br>
<p>
There's an excellent FAQ about calorie restriction, by Brian Manning<br>
Delaney, available at <br>

I haven't been very scientific about it: after I read Walford's<br>
books, I mysteriously developed the motivation to lose 35 pounds<br>
over the course of the next two years (hard data can be very<br>
motivating in the right context!), and since then I've just been<br>
trying not to regain it.  And when the mood strikes, I try to<br>
rearrange my diet in a more paleolithic direction: "How many hot<br>
fudge sundaes per year would my ancestors of forty thousand years<br>
ago have been in the habit of consuming?  Can my genome really deal<br>
with this?"  And I think I've managed to modify my habits enough<br>
that I probably eat *slightly* more dark-green or deep-yellow<br>
vegetables per week than I used to.<br>
<p>
But the time since I ate my last bag of Cheetos is<br>
embarrassingly small.<br>
