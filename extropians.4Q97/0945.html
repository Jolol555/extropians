I was wondering if anybody on this lists knows about *scientific*<br>
approaches to some of the phenomena most people consider mystical.<br>
Things like out-of-body-experiences, spontanuous recovery from<br>
sicknesses, witchcraft and so on. I'm quite sure that some of these<br>
things are relatively easy to explain while others haven't even been<br>
touched by science, yet.<br>
<p>
The first question to be asked: is something real or just hallucinated.<br>
I've never made an out-of-body-experience myself, but today, I've been<br>
told there are people who can actively do that. If that's true, you can<br>
try that under different conditions and it might be possible to find out<br>
some interesting things (it would also be quite interesting to develop<br>
methods for gaining knowledge about things like that).<br>
<p>
Another interesting thing would be to find out how homeopathy works. Or<br>
what astrology is all about. What has become of parapsychology<br>
(personally, I even find many common psychologists don't really seem to<br>
understand that much - I might be wrong, it's just an impression).<br>
<p>
I've intentionally kept this quite general to find out whether there is<br>
an interest in that at all, in further discussion, I'd appreciate<br>
talking about only one phenomena or class of phenomena.<br>
<p>
Has anybody heard of the "holographic theory"? I haven't had a chance to<br>
look into that, yet... I guess I have to read some books from the<br>
extropy-list first.<br>
<p>
later,<br>
Holger<br>
