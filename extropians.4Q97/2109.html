Duh.   As is almost everything else on this list. And, as the old saying<br>
goes, opinions are like bung holes: everyone has them. If everyone has<br>
them, then their market value is squat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;some list subscribers are taking with regards to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;list. So we have some newbies now and then, so we get spammed once in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;while. If I were the powers that be, I'd keep the main list open and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have higher level specialized lists for those who don't want to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their in boxes polluted by the tracks of ignorant plebes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That might work too. I have no particular problem with that, provided that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it costs something of value, p front, not necessarily money but something</i><br>
<i>&gt; of value that must be redeemed, to join the "higher level" lists. PLEAS PAY</i><br>
<i>&gt; SPECIAL NOTE that "higher level" is again your interpretation, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily A Fact.</i><br>
<p>
Ok, how about Specialized lists??? Just so you don't have to admit your<br>
feelings of being holier than thou.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Its not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cost that implies the "cult" flavor, its the isolationist attitude.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BZZZZT. Facts not in evidence.</i><br>
<p>
denial denial denial.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Those who don't want to be bothered with helping enlighten newbies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extropianism shouldn't have kept their subscription when the list went</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;public.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Michael, where do _I_ fit in? Are you telling me, a person who never joined</i><br>
<i>&gt; until "the list went public", that I should never have joined? This doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; make any sense to me; Help me out here, please.</i><br>
<p>
Once you get tired of it, unsubscribe. If you are tired of participation<br>
in the hubub of the free market of ideas. I took a two month break when<br>
I needed it. I may take another break this winter as ski season gets<br>
underway. Just because you are subscribed does not make you a slave to<br>
the list. If you don't want to hear it, like the proverbial mother, TURN<br>
IT OFF.<br>
<p>
I joined the list after it went public as well, but was a member of the<br>
transhuman list long before that, and was waiting for a while for<br>
extropians to open up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Here's an interim suggestion: Have a free subscription period, of say 3,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;6 or 12 months. Then have a subscription rate for further membership to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's a suggestion: Have a list where I can talk to people I trust and</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect, and other people can listen in. It's no more elitist than a panel</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion on TV, and it only costs money if you want to subscribe with</i><br>
<i>&gt; write-privs to the list. And as I mentioned before, there's CRIT.</i><br>
<p>
You don't see network television as elitist media? EXCUSE ME??? REALITY<br>
CHECK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see this as isolationist. Nor any more elitist than a gas station.</i><br>
<i>&gt; TANSTAAFL. My attention is worth something, AND SO IS YOURS. Get it? :)</i><br>
<p>
What is the current market rate. No, not your personal rate, the MARKET<br>
RATE. Seeing the utter lack of successful pay subscription services on<br>
the net, the value of your attention, on a statistical basis, is<br>
effectively nil.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;For those that complain about too much noise and too little substance,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you should be pushing the list owners to police relevancy/ongoing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stupidity more effectively. Subscribers should also police themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you think someone is not on topic, first a) check the FAQ yourself,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;then b) email the relevant text in the FAQ to the offender.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Allow me to render a free translation: We should be perfect people, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then any system would work.</i><br>
<p>
ad hominem et al....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BZZZZZT.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Many people here who are ardent libertarians seem to be rather welfarish</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in their attitude toward noise/signal on the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suggest you look to the seeming. I am offering to pay my own way; a</i><br>
<i>&gt; moment ago you were advocating that the list owners do more "policing".</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are at least two ironies here.</i><br>
<p>
Your are merely practicing the typical NIBY attitudes that, as a former<br>
resident of Seattle, I saw on a daily and excessive basis on the part of<br>
Californians who, once they moved up north to paradise, were doing their<br>
best to shut the door to keep anyone else from coming in. Pretty<br>
pathetic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you think someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is an ingnorant nincompoop, use personal email to go into long and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sufficient detail to educate the novice as to his or her error.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's fine, IF you want to. Feeling obliged, OTOH, seems like</i><br>
<i>&gt; lightly-veiled, well, does the word "welfarish" ring a bell?</i><br>
<p>
No its a matter of being a proper netizen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;THose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;who are too stubbornly newbie for it to have any effect on usually dig</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;themselves deep enough for some real fun once they get into rude enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't want to play that game so much any more.</i><br>
<p>
As the star of Starship Stroopers says: A Citizen is a person who makes<br>
the survival of the human race a matter of their personal<br>
responsibility.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you are not taking personal responsibility for fixing up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the signal to noise on the list, then its your fault. &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In your judgement. I believe I am taking personal responsibility by letting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world (instead of just Max) know that I approve of the experiment.</i><br>
<p>
Ok you voted. Good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I find the threat</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of high subscription rates simply the moral equivalent of trade</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;restrictions. Hardly libertarian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Au contraire. The tragedy of the commons is being enacted out all around us.</i><br>
<p>
Your motives speak for themselves. You are a) Trying to figure out a way<br>
to limit the level of participation in the list in a manner that<br>
hopefully increases the average intelligence of the list content. b) You<br>
propose to do this by charging people for posting priviledges, which is<br>
tantamount to a tariff on the free exchange of ideas. Your error is that<br>
you wrongly assume that there aren't people who don't mind spending<br>
money for the right to be complete idiots.<br>
<p>
Like any trade restriction, and as the list members in long standing<br>
should remember, the last time it was a closed list, with posting by<br>
charge only, traffic dwindled to nil, and the Transhuman mailing list<br>
sprung up which offered the same subject matter at a lower cost:<br>
nothing. It was an interesting exercise in free market economics. Its<br>
too bad nobody, especially those claiming to be economic libertarians,<br>
got the hint.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;--</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;TANSTAAFL!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Except in the extropy list, where we are supposed to give without end for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the good of the list, but it's still "free", but paying money for it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; sinful. *hunh*???</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
What is the cost of maintaining a mailing list??? Is this a case where<br>
there is no such thing as excess profit???<br>
<p>
As luminaries like Michael Kinsley have learned with Slate, the value of<br>
ideas on the web marketplace is far less than two cents. Slate was<br>
supposed to become a subscription service, but gave up and is still<br>
free. If Max wants to make money on the list, I suggest he use his free<br>
market rights and start using advertising as an income source.<br>
