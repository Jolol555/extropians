I too.  With a title like that, it would have been hard to ignore.  Anyway,<br>
though<br>
it has been a few years...  I found Lerner's book a bit too polemical, though a<br>
very good read.  It still remains to be seen if his (extension of Alfven's)<br>
theory is<br>
correct.<br>
<p>
To detail the argument as I recall it for the rest, Lerner basically think that<br>
electromagnetic fields play a big role on large scales -- as opposed to the<br>
conventional view that such fields have little affect on interstellar, galactic<br>
and intergalactic scales.  Lerner believes that the known universe is<br>
merely a portion of an infinite universe.  He explains inflation as a local<br>
phenomena.  He thinks that what has happened is that gravitational<br>
collapse influenced by electromagnetic separation of matter and anti-<br>
matter created a local bang.<br>
<p>
Some of his arguments look cogent.  He is able to explain via this theory,<br>
e.g., large scale structures.  To him, they predated the local expansion.<br>
He also is able to fit quasars and active radio sources into this too.  They<br>
are caused by plasma filaments.<br>
<p>
However, much of the book is devoted to polemics against scientists<br>
who are pro-Big Bang.  I guess this was necessary to make a popular<br>
book -- and perhaps to get attention of the scientific community too,<br>
as Lerner's theory is not taken seriously at all.  It would be good to<br>
see the matters discussed passionately dispassionately.:)<br>
