<i>   &gt;Consider the following number, whose name I forget:  </i><br>
<i>   &gt;..123456789101112131415161718192021222324...979899100101102103104105...   </i><br>
<i>   &gt;This is created by writing the series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,...   </i><br>
<i>   &gt;and concatenating all the digits. It is known to be an irrational number.</i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
It's called Champernowne's number and you're right, it is irrational. When I <br>
said no decimal could be irrational I was suffering from brain lock and <br>
vastly oversold my case, which was very foolish of me because my argument is <br>
not dependent on it. <br>
<p>
By the way, Champernowne's number is the first irrational number to be proven <br>
"normal" in base 10. Normal means that in the limit each digit will occur <br>
exactly 10% of the time, each block of 2 digits will occur exactly 1% of the <br>
time, each block of 3 digits will occur exactly .1% of the time etc. It's not  <br>
known if Champernowne's number is normal in any other base but 10, it's  not <br>
known if e or PI are normal in any base.  <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The number of bits in an infinite binary fraction is a countable         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;infinity.</i><br>
         <br>
You're right.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;The formula I * I (where I = aleph-null) does not come into play here.</i><br>
           <br>
Agreed. I shouldn't have mentioned it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>    &gt;The number of values that can be represented by an n bit fraction is 2^n.</i><br>
    <br>
True.<br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;So, you need to disagree with one (or both?) of these two points:      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;The real numbers correspond to infinite binary (or decimal) fractions      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;The number of infinite binary fractions is 2^aleph-null.</i><br>
    <br>
<p>
Your second statement is certainly true and it's not that I disagree with the <br>
first, it's just that nobody can prove it. <br>
    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;For the first to be wrong you'd have to have a real number which did         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;not correspond to any infinite decimal. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's right, and needless to say I can't give you such a number. Nobody has <br>
been able to produce a number on the line that can't be represented by a <br>
decimal and so prove the Continuum Hypothesis wrong, BUT nobody has been able  <br>
to show that the existence of such a number leads to a logical contradiction <br>
and so prove the Continuum Hypothesis correct.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In effect, it would have no value.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It would have no decimal value, but maybe there is a number on the line that  <br>
is a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller than any decimal number, maybe  <br>
decimal notation is just too coarse a net to catch all the points in a line,  <br>
maybe there are aleph-two or aleph- three points on the line. Or maybe not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In fact aren't the real numbers sometimes *defined* as all the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;values taken by infinite decimals?)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If so then the question becomes, does every point on the line have its own <br>
unique real number?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The Continuum Hypothesis does say that C is equal to  aleph-one, but         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the issue in question is what is aleph-one.  There are no sets known         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to have the  cardinality of aleph-one, as I understand it. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not so, there is a set called the Power Set Of Omega (Pw) that has been <br>
proven to contain aleph-one members. Pw is a set of sets, it's made up of all <br>
the sets of positive integers such a {1} {1,2,3,...} {314159...} and every <br>
other sequence of integers you can think of. To prove the Continuum  <br>
Hypothesis you'd need to find a one to one correspondence between the points  <br>
on the line and the elements in set Pw. This would be possible if every point  <br>
on the line can be represented by a decimal, but can it? As you say, a decimal <br>
has aleph -null digits, so you could represent 2^ aleph -null (aleph -one)  <br>
points on the line with decimal notation. The trouble is, what if there are <br>
more that aleph-one points on the line?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Aleph-one is defined as the smallest cardinal greater than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;aleph-zero.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's right, so if C is the number of points on the line then the Continuum <br>
Hypothesis can be phrased as "There is no cardinal number between aleph-zero <br>
and C". All we need now is a proof.                  <br>
