<i>&gt; &gt; I use the term "singularity" in deference to Vinge, who is a professor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of mathematics. It's only a qualitative analogy, however: the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; simplest equations that describe the simplest qualitative predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't actually have mathematical singularities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the "singularity".  While a simple interpolation and future</i><br>
<i>&gt; projection of (for example) available computing power may show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; flattening of the curve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd be very interested in seeing (and would write myself, if time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge allowed) an analysis of what a post-"singularity" plateau</i><br>
<i>&gt; might look like, given the most stringent constraints we know of.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously these constraints are products of our current understanding of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world, and thus may be suppressible given some future physics &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematics, but I think it a bit disingenuous to use a term like</i><br>
<i>&gt; "singularity" when our best current models of the world show bounded (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least, merely exponential) growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are much wiser heads out there on this list, so let me just start</i><br>
<i>&gt; off the conversation with a few constraints that I can see (again, given</i><br>
<i>&gt; our current physics &amp; mathematics):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Size Constraints:  Our current understanding of QM essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; constrains the precision with which we can build physical structures (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; direct energy) via Planck's constant, thus creating an apparent lower</i><br>
<i>&gt; bound on our engineering ambitions.  This in turn has consequences for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Moore's Law, as to date progress has been made largely via finer and</i><br>
<i>&gt; finer lithography techniques.</i><br>
<p>
By a recent post, use of quantum cellular designs, they operate better<br>
the smaller they are, could be as small as a few atoms, with a single<br>
layer of atoms between cells, and 5-10 layers between circuits. They<br>
also minimize heat and power consumption, another problem with current<br>
chip circuitry. How does this scale to current chip circuit sizes?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Speed Constraints:  Barring some revolution to Relativity, c limits the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of expansion of even a Vingean Power.  In addition it limits the</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed of signaling within that entity's "brain".  Again suggesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible constraints on the rate of computational growth.</i><br>
<p>
Well, what is the speed of chemical reactions across the brain, and from<br>
one end of the nervous system to the other? Whatever time lapse this is,<br>
scaled to C will give you an estimate of the size of the beast you are<br>
contemplating, for at least human capacity intelligence. Then again, if<br>
we are to take the word of some marine biologists, we need to think more<br>
on a scale of dolphins or whales nervous systems as baselines.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chaotic Computability Constraints:  The most ambitious nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenarios posit universal assemblers that can be programmed or designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to build specific structures.  IMHO this is a clearly chaotic system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The structure of any complex object created by this sort of nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; would seem to display an exquisite sensitivity to tiny variations in</i><br>
<i>&gt; design of the assembler (or the assembler "software"), and possibly to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the local environment itself.  I question whether we'll be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; design assembler protocols for very complex objects through any means</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than trial and error, which have their own pitfalls (e.g., grey</i><br>
<i>&gt; goo).</i><br>
<p>
Considering we are now playing with molecular sized motors, gears, and<br>
circuits in the lab, with our rather ham handed tools that dampen our<br>
movements down to a scale necessary to move actual atoms around, once<br>
simple and functional machines are actually built that can run, and can<br>
be built repetitively and reliably, then we will have brought the<br>
industrial age to the nano scale, and can expect a progression curve at<br>
the nano scale much like out own from the early 1800's onward. The<br>
advantages we now have is that we already know how things work best at<br>
macro scale, so its not like we have to totally reinvent anything, we<br>
already know whats possible.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (This is not to say that I'm skeptical of nanotech.  I think the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosaic nanotech scenarios have an enormous potential to revolutionize</i><br>
<i>&gt; our world.  If we can design nanomachines to construct individual parts</i><br>
<i>&gt; of more complex systems, for example, and then use macro-machines to</i><br>
<i>&gt; assemble them into the finished product, we will have gone a long way</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards eliminating scarcity.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm very interested in thoughts from the list on:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that we will see any significan leveling off. There will<br>
be short periods perhaps of slowing growth, but as established<br>
technologies reach their peaks, newer ones will come to the fore as they<br>
become economically feasible, like a multistage rocket dropping off<br>
spent boosters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Just how severe and insurmountable these constraints are.  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt; superstring-engineering allow us to bypass Planck's constant?  Will some</i><br>
<i>&gt; new, higher-level theory of complex systems provide more computationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient means of simulating chaotic systems?  Will quantum computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any benefit here?  Can a sufficiently advanced entity construct a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pocket universe where Planck's constant and c are different from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; own?  Is there any way to communicate between that universe and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; one?</i><br>
<p>
I would guess that the closer the physical laws in a pocket universe are<br>
to our own, the easier communication will be.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; cheers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; mez</i><br>
