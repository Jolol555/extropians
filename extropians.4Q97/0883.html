Mea culpa for this shooting from the hip...<br>

This is different; I'm saying that even with the key already in place at<br>
both ends, you need either perfect information through the channel (in<br>
both time and frequency domains) or *some* redundancy/pattern, however<br>
small; the latter permits you to resynchronize if that is needed.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also: If the clock is being referenced to say, a pulsar that all can</i><br>

<i>&gt; eh?</i><br>
<p>
Something *approximating* it, maybe. Another problem is that (I think) you<br>
have to be able to _resolve_ time to the granularity of the symbol rate.<br>
Methinks there's another engineering limit there. You'd have to know<br>
your position and velocity relative to the pulsar in order to correct for<br>
Lorentz-Fitzgerald effects; h-bar &lt;uncertainty&gt; = delta p x delta v,<br>
right? I am not sure whether all these limits converge, but my gut and<br>
vague memories say they do.<br>
<p>
Now, if you have zero-lag action at a distance, then the pulsars could be<br>
clocks for all the "smart" stars. Good luck--I'm not willing to say<br>
it's utterly impossible; I just doubt it's a commonplace across the<br>
universe, and I think the proposition is impossible to falsify, and more<br>
of a bull session topic than something to take action regarding: "What if<br>
there were infinitely powerful beings? Why' they could do... *anything*!"<br>
Fun to yack about, but as unsatisfying as rock-wool candyfloss. IMHO. :)<br>
<p>
Carl F. might have a more informed opinion; for sure he's got more math<br>
than I.<br>
