It is interesting to note that the murder rate in Vermont, which is the <br>
only state in the country that does not even require a permit to carry a <br>
concealed gun, was 2.1 per 100,000 in 1992. (Source: Statistical <br>
Abstract of the U.S., 1994 edition.) The overall Canadian murder rate <br>
has been around 2-3 per 100,000 in recent years. As a matter of fact, <br>
most of the states bordering Canada, which tend to have similar ethnic <br>
composition, have comparable murder rates. <br>
<p>
Murder rates in the U.S. have been dropping in recent years despite an <br>
increase in the number of guns.  <br>
<p>
Those interested in gun control should be interested in a recent CATO <br>
Institute study. CATO concluded that states which have liberalized their <br>
concealed carry permit systems to allow all law abiding citizens to <br>
carry a handguns have experienced drops in their murder rates much <br>
higher than the national average. <br>
<p>
I would say that politicians who refuse to allow people to arm <br>
themselves have blood on their hands. Unfortunately, the anti-gun nuts <br>
don't seem to want to be confused by the facts. I am pro-gun, but I <br>
would at least admit it if gun control really did work. The other side <br>
seems to be more of a religion (and a lethal one at that) than a <br>
rational position.    <br>
<p>
This issue is especially important for extropians because I assume that <br>
it is obviously in our own best interests not to be murdered. Duh!<br>
