Dear Wings:<br>
<p>
I don't want to engage in a kneejerk response, even though this is a<br>
hot-button topic for many. <br>
<p>
I used to feel something like the way you seem to. However, I changed my<br>
mind. Please read on.<br>

With respect, the numbers available don't show that at all.<br>
<p>
Since you obviously feel very deeply about this, perhaps you won't mind if<br>
I respond to your story about the little kid with a story about another<br>
kind of victim.<br>
<p>
***WARNING***: the following description is not for the fainthearted.<br>
<p>
Are you familiar with the case of the 15-year-old girl who was hitchiking,<br>
and was picked up by a man--well, genus Homo sapiens--who raped her<br>
repeatedly and brutally *after* hacking both her forearms off?<br>
<p>
Do you know that according to the evidence, that "man" left her to die<br>
iwht her raw stumps still bleeding--and while in his car, masturbated with<br>
one of the sawn-off hands while he shoved the fingers fingers of the other<br>
up his anus?<br>
<p>
She's still alive, seriously traumatized, and the "man" is, after getting<br>
out of jail, now being prosecuted for a brutal home invasion and slashing<br>
assault/rape/murder of another woman.<br>
<p>
**********<br>
<p>
Forget about children for just a moment. Are you telling me that no women<br>
should have any recourse to defend themselves against someone stronger?<br>
Someone trying to hack their arms off and let them bleed to death?<br>
Someone carving their chest into a bloody puddle of ribbons?<br>
<p>
Please think this through, it's tough when you feel strongly, but try to<br>
feel like those women for a moment. Could you tell yourself that your<br>
death was right and good because it shouldn't have ever happened?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; intelligence, compromise, rather than by shear force, death, and fear.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; we, as an intelligent people, are never able to come together to resolve</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict in a peaceful manner, than I've given up all hope.</i><br>
<p>
As I mentioned above, I was depressed by this prospect, too--for many<br>
years. I figured things out for myself, over about five years.<br>
<p>
It doesn't depress me quite so much any more, because I know what I'm<br>
willing to die for. This isn't braggadocio, no matter what it sounds like<br>
to others. Knowing what I'm willing to die for doesn't mean I'm eager to<br>
die, nor to kill. And I have managed to resolve conflict in a peaceful<br>
manner even when guns were available. And if I ever needed to deal with<br>
someone like that "man", I know I'd do my best with whatever I had.<br>
<p>
The world needs all sort of people, doesn't it? Including ones who can<br>
trust each other with things that can be misapplied?<br>
<p>
Some folks I know came up with a trademarked slogan, <br>
<p>
"Visualize Armed Peace". <br>
<p>
It belongs right next to another bumper sticker:<br>
<p>
"War is over--if you want it."<br>
<p>
I find nothing to fault in either sentiment.<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>
<p>
