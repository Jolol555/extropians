I feel that most intelligent people who have a lot to contribute probably find it<br>
an excessive waste of time to wade through so many postings.  Therefore, I<br>
suggest that all those who post should be Extropy Institute (EI) members.  I do<br>
not believe that basic EI membership should have a price tag though. Another<br>
electronic community that I am a member of (the HTML Writer's Guild at<br>
<a href="http://www.hwg.org">http://www.hwg.org</a>.) has several levels of membership but basic membership is<br>
free.  In this way those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can<br>
subscribe to a print copy magazine (sort of like Web Magazine), other services,<br>
get a plaque (ala Public Television) or whatever. A live chat room for Level 2<br>
members, for example might be set up.  An archive of the most popular threads<br>
could be available for Level 3.  A member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or online by<br>
access number) is possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list<br>
but would be paid for by the members who desire such services.  It's a thought<br>
worth serious thought.  Maybe a vote of sorts could be taken.  Who would I<br>
contact about this plebiscite notion?<br>
