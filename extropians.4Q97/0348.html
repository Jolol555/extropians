I can't find any message containing the words "fire" and "water" - except the<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Right, but that's not the end of it. There are many who reject in detail,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then with a label change or two swallow the whole.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how this is relevant.  My thesis is that you have committed<br>
logical errors of generalization, semantics, and causal analysis, to wit:<br>
<p>
"Most (religious) supreme beings rely on an instantiation of 'objective<br>
morality'; therefore the concept of 'objective morality' relies on a supreme being."<br>
<p>
That is, you have generalized from the way religions do it to the way everyone<br>
does it; you have confused the concept of objective morality with particular<br>
moralities that claim to be objective, and you have assumed that because A<br>
relies on B then B relies on A.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;This doesn't mean that the concept of "objective</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reality" is indefeasibly predicated on the existence of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I didn't say it is. I said it is predicated upon the idea of a superior</i><br>
<i>&gt; being not necessarily only the "god" of formal religion. The focal question</i><br>
<i>&gt; is as you have indirectly indicated is whether the concept, morality, has</i><br>
<i>&gt; any definitive basis in ANYTHING existing independently of human individual.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that this is the focal question.  The answer is:  "Either it does or<br>
it does not."  Since the behavior which results from acting on the possibility<br>
is not destructive, I believe that I am justified in acting on the normalized<br>
objective interim value of all goals.  Or in plain English, I do whatever I<br>
feel probably has objective value, as long as this doesn't make me a lunatic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fire\water example illustrates the conclusion that it does not.</i><br>
<p>
I'd love to hear it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hate to get into a dissertation on language, but I feel obliged to</i><br>
[long dissertation on "objective" and "subjective" deleted]<br>
<i>&gt; (To evaluate objectively is to determine what is AS IS independently of</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's personal valuations. Since no one is infallible, the everpresent</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is whether one does or does not succeed in such efforts. )</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how this confusion impinges on the present discussion, since<br>
neither you nor I have committed that particular error.  There's "objective"<br>
in the cognitive sense, and "objective" in the ontological sense.  I assert<br>
that there exists an ontologically objective morality.  Having done so, it is<br>
possible to apply cognitive objectivity to the evaluation of particular moral theories.<br>
<p>
Insofar as we are all Extropians, I doubt that *anyone* here would flinch from<br>
having the *ability* to apply objective cognitive reasoning to *anything*. <br>
The question is whether the cognitive concept, "ontologically objective<br>
morality", contributes to cognitively objective morality.  I hold that the<br>
cognitive concept of the ontological objectivity of X is a prerequisite for<br>
the cognitively objective evaluation of statements about X.  Otherwise,<br>
anybody can simply state eir opinion and refuse to debate it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Likewise, religions state that their morality is objective and that God gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to define objective morality.  This does not mean that objective morality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;requires a God; it means that the religion in question thinks so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In formal religion, how many thousands of denomination labels exist implying</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference in beliefs. If we ignore the facade variations and go to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; directive radical of each, what do we find?</i><br>
<p>
That doesn't make the slightest difference.  Formal religion is not<br>
prerequisite to objective morality.  In order to demonstrate otherwise, you<br>
must take my theory of objective morality and demonstrate a causal reliance<br>
upon religion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They're all the same! The</i><br>
<i>&gt; common denominator, regardless of label and claims of difference, is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subordination of human individual to an expressed and\or implied superior</i><br>
<i>&gt; being. This is the actual definition of religion, per se.</i><br>
<p>
You are factually incorrect.  Many religions (such as Buddhism) do not rely on<br>
the "subordination" of the believer to anything or anyone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By reference to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this actual definition, does it not logically follow that any belief system</i><br>
<i>&gt; that expresses or implies a human individual as subordinated property of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; non human superior being is no less religion than the formal variety?</i><br>
<p>
No.  Nothing may logically follow from a tautology except the tautology<br>
itself.  I might admit that within your continuum of pure logic the statement<br>
follows, but within this real world of Yudkowsky and Eric Watt Forste the<br>
statement fails.  The "actual definition of religion" does not exist except as<br>
a premise for argument.  Extensionally, most objects denoted as "religions"<br>
share some properties such as worship, faith, and a theory of ethics which is<br>
claimed to be objective truth.  Western religions also share the concept of a<br>
supreme being.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What of the phrases, "values of society", "public welfare", "national</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest", "government does", as only four of a horrendously long list of</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts that express and\or imply the subordination of individual to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior being? Separation of church and state?  Quite a joke.  How does</i><br>
<i>&gt; "state" exist except by thought and action treating "State" as a volitional,</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuing, acting, supreme god to which each and every individual is subordinated?</i><br>
<p>
I suggest you read up on the Constitutional Convention.  A state may exist as<br>
a social compact between the rulers and the ruled - the theory the Founding<br>
Fathers(*) started out with.  Or as sovereign power which has its sole source<br>
in the people and is willingly delegated by them into a formal government - a<br>
concept introduced by James Wilson that wound up as the base of the<br>
Constitution.  There was a great deal of debate regarding how much power the<br>
United States should have, whether it should be able to overrule the component<br>
States, and even what the fundamental basis of government was.  In our modern<br>
times, government is by thought and action treated like some huge, lumbering<br>
beast.  The attitude you describe is not often seen.<br>
<p>
(*) = They were all male, so the indictment implied by the phrase is correct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, if we eliminate human individual as the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; "objective morality", what logically remains except a volitional, valuing</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that</i><br>
<i>&gt; something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external</i><br>
<i>&gt; "something" volitional thing to create an "objective morality?"</i><br>
<p>
In an alternate Universe, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; However, if we eliminate individual opinions as the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; "objective reality", what logically remains except the opinions of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that</i><br>
<i>&gt; something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external</i><br>
<i>&gt; "something" opinionated thing to create an "objective reality?"</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The key fallacy is not the assumed existence of objective morality, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your particular morality is objective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The latter claim does not come about EXCEPT by the initial fallacy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective morality.</i><br>
<p>
So what?  Claims of God's existence do not come about EXCEPT by the initial<br>
fallacy, objective reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Science states that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there exists an objective reality, but we do not know what it is.  My ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system makes the same statement with respect to morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The first statement presumes to grasp objective reality as a whole in</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradiction of a mind's requirement for limitation and difference; so, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, "we do not know what it is", for none can grasp infinity.</i><br>
<p>
You object to this?  You don't think an objective reality exists?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for</i><br>
<i>&gt; claiming to know that "morality" exists, but not knowing what it is, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to indicate that the alleged "objective morality" is not derived from</i><br>
<i>&gt; an explainable differentiated aspects of an objective reality, but rather a</i><br>
<i>&gt; feeling whose origin and cause in not necessarily derived from any fact at all.</i><br>
<p>
My "objective morality" is not derived, period.  I hypothesize it.  I never<br>
claimed to have proven it.  I simply observe that the known operating<br>
principles of the Universe seem to allow for such things to happen, although<br>
generally not in the way we expect.<br>
<p>
I should likewise note that nobody has ever really proven that an "objective<br>
reality" exists.  Descartes would seem to have proven that some form of<br>
reality exists, but through the usage of entirely subjective reasoning. <br>
Insofar as this is the only evidence for the existence of reality, a<br>
determined solipsist could argue that reality is most likely subjective.<br>
<p>
And yet, science still works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;May I paraphrase?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"Any 'rational' goal is simply a rational means to some other, not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;justified goal.  Therefore, there are no 'inherently rational' goals.  All</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't mind paraphrasing IF it stays with the program. I'm afraid your's</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't. The first thing you throw in is the term, rational, qualifying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept, goal. This is neither expressed nor implied in my assertions.</i><br>
<p>
I threw in the term, 'rational', in quotes.  This denotes that the concept of<br>
a 'rational' goal is being attacked.  Which you did.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Natural paradox" is a euphemism for contradiction denied. The dilemma in</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus is of your own creating.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, so why *does* anything exist at all?  I'd really like to know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By volitional nature, an individual seeks goals, period. This talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational and irrational is just subjective value judgment stuff thrown in</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the belief and pretense that the call is made from objective criteria.</i><br>
<p>
I can't answer this fully without getting more technical than I wish to. <br>
Suffice it to say that we humans have a cognitive system for processing goals<br>
and efforts, and that the value of an effort derives from the value of the<br>
goal, and that efforts can be imported as goals when a sub-effort is needed. <br>
Humans also have certain primitive goals whose value is arbitrarily set by<br>
evolution.  The goal-processing system is intertwined with the causal model of<br>
reality, so we assign truth and falsity to value statements about goals. <br>
Since we assign truth and falsity, I ask whether such statements can be<br>
objectively true or false.<br>
<p>
The answer is yes; idealized AI versions of our cognitive processes (such as<br>
"SHRDLU", "AM" and "EURISKO", and any program written in Prolog) obey<br>
mathematical and Platonic laws while remaining faithful to our intuitions, and<br>
thus a given cognitive evaluation of the value of a goal is "true" or "false"<br>
depending on whether our mathematics are correct.  My question about the<br>
existence of "objective morality" can be phrased as:  "Does there exist a<br>
mathematically correct derivation of value for some goal, in a system where no<br>
goals have initial value, and with no hypotheticals in the justification network?"<br>
<p>
It may seem like a great leap from our questions about truth and falsity to<br>
the assumption of objective truth or falsity.  No less a leap is made when our<br>
enormously complex systems for processing the "truth" or "falsity" of an<br>
opinion are compared to objective reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;All</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aside from the contradiction, objective value,  I see a lot of goals here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but no means. Combine this omission with the fallacy, objective value, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; its little wonder you find the problem unresolvable.  Fact does not serve to</i><br>
<i>&gt; validate fiction.  Once again, definition, comes to the rescue.</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand what you're talking about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First question, what is a goal? If an actual definition conforms to</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective reality, it logically follows that an actual definition is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; 100% consistent in time and application. So what fits to define the term</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal? How about: A goal is a desire to exchange one set of circumstances for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a different set of circumstances. Will that get it?</i><br>
<p>
What's a desire?  Look, I'm always fiddling with things like the limbic system<br>
(handles some emotions), or with AIs that have coded objects called "goals". <br>
When I talk about a "goal", I'm talking about either events in the human brain<br>
or events in some computer, preferably the latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every day and all day, you and every conscious functioning individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; continually pursue and achieve goals. This is not always of a consciouss</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature, but it is no less pursuit of and achieving goals. It is only when</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus is required that one is inclined to name a goal. What set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; circustances you name as a goal is arbitrary. The means to achieve it are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not. Suppose you desire to quench your thirst. Possible means is you getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; a drink of water by your own direct efforts, or having someone bring it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. While there is no objective right or wrong regarding your choice to</i><br>
<i>&gt; quench your thirst, there are objective requirements to achieve this end.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They are called means.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's how the human brain handles it, rather roughly speaking.  But an<br>
AI handles it differently.  All efforts and purposes are instantiations of the<br>
computational object called a "goal".  Goals have subgoals, and the subgoals<br>
have subgoals.  It's a goal hierarchy.  That's what I mean when I say that<br>
"value" is a derived quantity.  Intuitively, all value has to come from<br>
somewhere.  But your statement that it has to be a single goal, whose value is<br>
validated by nonhuman superiority, is analogous to the statement that, since<br>
reality must intuitively come from somewhere, there exists a "creation"<br>
hierarchy, the apex of which is validated by moral superiority.  Both<br>
statements contain a logical fallacy, to wit, refusing to answer the question.<br>
 This does not obviate the existence of objective reality, although it should.<br>
 By analogy, it does not obviate the existence of objective morality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In literally every claim of "objective value" I have encountered apart from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the formal religion variety which openly claims "God" as "objective value"</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause, the claimant manages to bring in a personal value and pretend that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is objective discovery. Some, like Rand, go to great lengths to "prove" this</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery. The "ought from is" fantasy. Others just toss it in without so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as a by your leave.</i><br>
<p>
You are incorrect.  Where have I done so?  I have claimed that "objective<br>
value" exists, although not that my values are objective.<br>
<p>
Since the human mind is not capable of deducing or designing objective values,<br>
it should come as no great surprise that all claimed instantiations of<br>
"objective value" are false, at least in the sense of the claimed rational<br>
justification being false.<br>
<p>
Most claims of "objective reality" were false prior to the invention of science.<br>
