<i>&gt;the situation is: Volitionally active. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Our values do not appear out of nothingness.</i><br>

<i>&gt;What do they appear out of? The natural ability to attribute value, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; They are rooted in instincts, and adapted by volition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Didn't you say one could choose to not go along with what you call</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive urges? If this is the case, even if you label some urges as</i><br>
<i>&gt;instictive, if they are overridden by volition, how can they be rooted in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the very thing that volition overrides? Doesn't this place the concept,</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinct, as subordinate to volition?  If this is the case, isn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt;placing "objective instincts" as subjectively alterable, or subject to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dismissal by choice? Doesn't this directly contradict the concept, objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality, as not subject to alteration or dismissal by subjective choice and</i><br>
<i>&gt;decree? </i><br>
<p>
To override the effects of something is not to make it non-existant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where are all these contradiction coming from? From what else except absence</i><br>
<i>&gt;of definition allowing the root contradiction to be obscured?  What is this</i><br>
<i>&gt;root contradiction?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If, as you acknowledge, our instinctive urges exist, though we choose to not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be directed by them, why would we define them as not subject to volition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To the contrary, I made no such acknowledgment. What I said was: &gt;&gt;the urges</i><br>
<i>&gt;in question ARE NOT (emp. added) in the realm of instinct.&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The whole thing comes down to defining the term, instinct. What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;term's connection to objective reality? Answering this question clears up</i><br>
<i>&gt;the matter.</i><br>
<p>
The effects of instinct can be overridden. Ask any pet owner or animal trainer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question to be answered is: Does a term, and definition of it, describe</i><br>
<i>&gt;some aspect of objective reality, or does it create it? Most would balk at</i><br>
<i>&gt;consciously claiming they can create objective reality by words; yet this</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim is implicity incorporated in every argument of the fallacy, objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;value, whatever the manifestation. The acceptance of this fallacy as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"unquestionable truth" is so commonplace and so dominanat in most beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems that the distortion of language usage needed and used to support the</i><br>
<i>&gt;illusion is not even noticed by the users. </i><br>
<p>
Irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's observe infant animals, human and otherwise, that survive without</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious effort of plan of action.  Choice plays no part in it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;reactive entity has no choice. Neither your choice nor mine can change this</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural circumstance. The urges that direct the survival reactions are</i><br>
<i>&gt;inherent in the entities. It is fact that there is no choice in the matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;To this natural condition, we apply the term, instinct. Ergo, the term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinct, by definition, excludes choice. </i><br>
<p>
Overriding does not alter, nor eliminate instinct. Choice has nothing to do<br>
with the definition of instinct, one way or the other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thus does the definition conform</i><br>
<i>&gt;to reality AS IS. (It would not be opposed to the definition of instinct to</i><br>
<i>&gt;include the natural directive of an individual to pursue what he conceives</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be in his self interest. However, and it a very big however, let us not</i><br>
<i>&gt;forget that what one may conceive to be in his self interest is not an</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive reaction.) </i><br>
<p>
Whence self-interest, if not instinct?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To speak of urges as instinctive, yet can be followed or denied by choice is</i><br>
<i>&gt;to contradict the definition of instinct. If we have a natural reactive non</i><br>
<i>&gt;volitional circumstance of behavior and apply the term, instinct, to this</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation, can we turn right around and apply the term, instinct, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;volitional determination and have both usages conforming to reality?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wouldn't this be saying that instinct means non volitional reaction AND</i><br>
<i>&gt;volitional action. In such usage, the term, instinct, does not serve to</i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiate two objectively separate conditions from each other. </i><br>
<p>
Volition has nothing to do with the definition of instinct, one way or the<br>
other. You seek to define instinct by its effects (in specific instances),<br>
rather than by its true nature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Based on actual definition of the term, instinct, what you are calling</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive urges that "impel but do not compel" are not instinctive at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If these urges were, indeed, objective instinct, they would compel for that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the nature of instinct. Other than to seek self interest as one conceives</i><br>
<i>&gt;it to be, the urges may be life oriented or death oriented, thus are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter of subjective choice, not objective mandate.</i><br>
<p>
Instinct impels, but does not compel. Animals make choices based on external<br>
criteria.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since an actual definition connects to objective reality in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiating manner, it simplifies and clarify. Unfortunately (for my</i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose), few are looking for simplification and clarification as it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;expose as false dominanat beliefs they hold as unquestionable truth. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt;this circumstance is commonplace, indeed, nearly universal, one is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to find the truth of definition even discussed in most forums, let</i><br>
<i>&gt;alone practiced by a large number of individuals. Be that as it may, my</i><br>
<i>&gt;analysis and experience leaves me with the truth of it and it has proven</i><br>
<i>&gt;invaluable in literally every aspect of my life. So, rather than abandon it</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply because it is not popular and intrudes upon popular notions, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt;continue to use it to expose a large portion of what "everybody knows" as myth.</i><br>
<p>
More irrelevancy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Stepping down from my soap box, let us now take a look at the term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective and subjective in the same manner that we examined the term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinct and non instinct. I observe things, entities and relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt;existing independently of my mind and independently of my mind to alter the</i><br>
<i>&gt;immutable natural laws that are inherent cause. To this observed condition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I apply the term, objective.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I observe that that I and others are human individuals, each with a mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is the causal base for conclusions, beliefs and valuations. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition of derived from a mind and dependent upon mind, I differentiate</i><br>
<i>&gt;from objective by the term, subjective. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If these are actual definitions by virtue of describing an immutable reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;of 100% consistency, it logically follows that factual word arrangements</i><br>
<i>&gt;must necessarily reflects these definitions and truth in any and every</i><br>
<i>&gt;usage. If a belief actually conforms to reality, would there be any need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do otherwise? If this is true, what does this say of beliefs that are</i><br>
<i>&gt;believed and promoted by non definition?</i><br>
<p>
If your dog chases a cat, you tell him to stop, and he does, does he still<br>
have his intinctive urge to chase the cat? <br>
<p>
You are attempting to apply a non-definition to the objectively observable<br>
phenomenon of "instinct." Instinct can be overridden.<br>
<p>
And you still haven't told us where your universal value of self-interest<br>
comes from.<br>
<p>
&lt;usual irreligious irrelevacies deleted&gt;<br>
