Sorry, Eliezer. I knew you were also a radical singularitan, but I<br>
didn't<br>
recall that you were also in the "any day now" camp. I've lent my<br>
copy of the book out and have not yet ordered another. I know that<br>
the two of us arrived at our conclusions independently, and I was<br>
very reassured when I found your work. It made me feel a bit less like<br>
some kind of pseudo-religous nut. (Yes, I know feelings can be deceiving<br>
:)<br>
<p>
I find it very frustrating that the list spends so much time on<br>
irrelevant issues of economics and politics. The current economic<br>
and political environment will not change significantly prior to<br>
the singularity: there's not enough time, even if the event occurs<br>
in 2025.<br>
