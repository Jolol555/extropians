The rules of arithmetic are very different and non intuitive when you deal <br>
with infinite numbers, mathematicians call them Cardinal  Numbers.  The rules <br>
for infinite arithmetic were discovered by the German Mathematician <br>
George Cantor (1845-1918). Today he is universally recognized  as one of the <br>
greatest mathematicians in the last 100 years, but during most of his <br>
lifetime he was thought a fool by his colleagues and treated quite shabbily. <br>
They thought the idea of mathematical infinity was stupid. He died penniless <br>
and quite insane in a mental hospital. These ferocious attacks a century ago <br>
on the leading advocate of mathematical infinity remind me a little of the <br>
attacks on the leading advocate of physical infinity today. I hope Cantor's  <br>
fate does not befall to poor Tipler. <br>
<p>
Cantor proved that the number of integers, call it A, is the smallest <br>
cardinal  number. He proved that the amount of even numbers is the same as <br>
the amount of all numbers. He proved that N*A =A if N is any finite number, <br>
and he even  proved that A*A =A. However  he also proved that 2^A is NOT <br>
equal to A. <br>
<p>
Cantor's crowning achievement was when he proved something we now call <br>
Cantor's Theorem, it states that if B is any cardinal number then B &lt; 2^B.   <br>
This means there are an infinite number of cardinal numbers, an infinite   <br>
number of different infinities.  However he was not able to figure out if <br>
there is an infinite number between the number of integers and the number of  <br>
points on a line, and even today it is not known.           <br>
     <br>

No. The number of points in a line or in a square or in a cube or in a <br>
hyper-cube of finite dimensions are the same, that is, you can put them in a <br>
one to one correspondence.                           <br>
