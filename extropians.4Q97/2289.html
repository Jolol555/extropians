<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry, I whould have said CFC caused ozone hole.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, CFC, not just chlorine.  <br>
<p>
Chloroflourocarbons.<br>
<p>
Those nice molecules that (as compared to most gas molecules in the <br>
air), weigh about as much as a small horse, and are extremely <br>
vulnerable to bioprocesses and sunlight.<br>
<p>
They are going to remain intact while they defy gravity to rise into <br>
the stratosphere and simultaneously cross not one, but two, breaks in <br>
atmospheric air current patterns.  (The wind patterns of the earth <br>
are pretty neatly divided into three groups, and adjacent groups <br>
don't interact much.  The groups can be described with a fair degree <br>
of accuracy as: the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere, <br>
and Antarctica.  Almost all human industrial activity has occurred in <br>
the northern hemisphere.)<br>
<p>
They are going to do this in sufficient number to make a major <br>
difference in an environment which has injected into it on a daily <br>
basis, by natural causes, an amount of chlorine compounds comparable<br>
to the entire annual human industrial consumption of chlorine.<br>
<p>
They can also stop speeding locomotives just by holding up a hand <br>
(and, amazingly, the trains don't derail when stopped so suddenly <br>
from the front).<br>
