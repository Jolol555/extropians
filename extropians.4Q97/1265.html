<i>&gt; I have read Schiff's books, and other arguments that the income tax is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "voluntary"; that your income tax form can be used in court against you</i><br>
<i>&gt; so therefore to prosecute someone for failure to file would violate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 5th amendment; that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is competent scholarship to support the contention that the 16th</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amendment to the US Constitution was never properly ratified by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; required number of states, and the other arguments all have</i><br>
<i>&gt; merit...unfortunately, that is irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As I understand it, there is a legal maxim that "specificities in</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence supersede generalities in evidence."  We all are supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have some general protections and rights under the constitution, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom of speech.  However, if I am hired by a client and sign an</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreement not to reveal his confidential information, I cannot later</i><br>
<i>&gt; publish it and claim my 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; general right to freedom of speech was superseded by my specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractual agreement not to publish this information.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When you open a bank account, you usually sign an agreement which</i><br>
<i>&gt; includes some seemingly innocuous clause that you will abide by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rules of the bank.  If you read all the fine print you will find that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you agreed to abide by all of the administrative rulings of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Secretary of the Treasury.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When new Federal Judges are confirmed they are told how to manage "Tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; Protester" trials -- violations of Title 26.  Federal Judges have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; instructed that the Supreme Court ruled in 1896  (Davis vs. Elmira</i><br>
<i>&gt; Savings, 161 U.S. 275), that banks are instrumentalities of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Congress.  In other words, the interstate system of banks is the private</i><br>
<i>&gt; property of the state.  So as an operation of law, anyone who has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; depository relationship, or a credit relationship, with a bank, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; checking, savings, charge cards, loans, mortgages, etc., are</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiencing profit and gain created by the state.</i><br>
<p>
If I am not experiencing any interest gain in my account, how am I<br>
experiencing profit and gain created by the state? If the state were not<br>
here to make me deposit my pay, or make the bank not cash my checks<br>
unless I have an account, then my employer would pay me in cash or<br>
whatever other instrument works, so where does the state create any<br>
profit or gain except by armed displacement?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; During Willful Failure to File trials the IRS surveys the local banks in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the vicinity of the tax protester, and obtains copies of his signature</i><br>
<i>&gt; card.  During the prosecution the Federal Judge is sitting up there on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bench with that agreement with the state in front of him while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tax protester cites his Constitutional rights.</i><br>
<p>
So basically, since the government wont let a bank cash my paycheck<br>
unless I have established an account that requires me to agree to abide<br>
by Title 26, even though congress never enacted it, they are using the<br>
threat of poverty and unemployment for anyone who doesn't agree to abide<br>
by title 26. If this is the case, then the escape is to claim in court<br>
that that agreeement was signed under duress and therefore is not<br>
legally enforceable. Is that enough of a specificity in evidence for<br>
you????<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The judge will ignore all Constitutionally related arguments.  He is</i><br>
<i>&gt; operating on the penal clause to a civil contract.  And since there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; an agreement to be bound by Title 26, what difference does it make</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether or not Title 26 was ever enacted by the Congress?  A contract</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not have to be enacted by Congress in order to make it enforceable.</i><br>
<p>
And a contract entered into under duress is not enforceable.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
