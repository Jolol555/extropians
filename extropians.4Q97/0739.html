<i>&gt; &gt; of the luddite/neoluddite movement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, you can tell these luddites are scum even without knowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; too much about their background and general history, methinks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The genlabs simply need better protection, like guards that hit first</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ask questions later, or some vicious dogs.</i><br>
<p>
That position is dangerous, and doesn't solve anything. It would<br>
likely just mean a more polarized situation, more violent luddites and<br>
even less public support for genetic engineering - if something is<br>
surrounded by barbed wire and dangerous guards, it cannot be good,<br>
right?<br>
<p>
Most of the truly dangerous luddites are not the activists; the<br>
activitsts could just as well be attacking meat trucks, abortion<br>
clinics or racist organisations, their luddism is mostly just a<br>
convenient reason to be an activist. The real danger comes from the<br>
"normal people", who can be much more dangerous for research and<br>
development by the power of public opinion, voting and spending money,<br>
and the people who can convince them that genetic engineering is<br>
unnatural, evil and dangerous. No amount of guards, barbed wire and<br>
dogs can protect againste Jeremy Rifkin and the other<br>
biofundamentalists.<br>
<p>
To quote somebody who was interviewed on Swedish television<br>
(unfortunately without the regional dialect which really made it<br>
funny): "There should be an end to progress so people can keep their<br>
jobs!". That view is dangerously common, and people in general fear<br>
change despite the fact that it helps them in the long run. It is very<br>
easy to use this fear to strike against proponents or technologies of<br>
change such as genetic engineering, the Internet och<br>
transhumanists. Think about it.<br>
