Fox TV just had a promo for their News at 10pm (Maryland),<br>
saying, "Will those who promoted the missile theory take <br>
a hit from the Grand Jury?"<br>
<p>
A grand jury was formed to investigate missile theorists <br>
last March. Two theorists have been threatened with being<br>
hauled before it, Russell and Marshall Houston, but were<br>
not.  Houston had a contact at Lockheed who knew about a <br>
live-footage video showing TWA 800 being hit by a missile. <br>
There was in fact a film crew on the beach that evening. <br>
<p>
The FBI sent agents out to Oregon the same day they got wind <br>
of this after squeezing Mike Sommer. Houston was threatened <br>
with being taken to grand jury in New York. Little else is <br>
known about this grand jury. About it CNN said (03/12/97):<br>
<p>
        The FBI this week launched a criminal<br>
        investigation, hoping to stop missile<br>
        theorists.<br>

<p>
Thugs vs theories, intimidation vs inquiry, fear <br>
vs freedom, might vs right, the sword vs the pen. <br>
