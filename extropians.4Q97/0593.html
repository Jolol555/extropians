<p>
As an exercise, I thought I'd try to find a meaning for the<br>
purportedly meaningless part of that sentence.<br>
<p>
Working backwards, the first stumbling block is "transfinite<br>
singularity". This is presumably a singularity in some function.<br>
The question is: in what sense is it "transfinite"?<br>
The function might be transfinite-valued at this point,<br>
or the singularity might be located in a transfinite region<br>
of the function's domain (the set of values for which the<br>
function is defined). Consider, for example, the function x^2. <br>
It is defined for transfinite ordinals like omega just as<br>
much as it is for finite numbers. (For those who haven't<br>
run across it, omega is the first number that comes after<br>
all the finite numbers 1, 2, 3,... After omega come<br>
omega+1, omega+2, ... 2*omega, 2*omega+1, ..., "and so on".)<br>
An example of a function with a transfinite singularity,<br>
in the second sense, is f(x) = 1/(x-omega), which is <br>
singular at x=omega.<br>
<p>
The next stumbling block is "noncommutative divergence".<br>
Commutativity is the property that a.b = b.a, something<br>
that's true when "." is multiplication and a and b are<br>
integers, but not true when a and b are rotations of<br>
neighboring Rubik's cube faces and "." means "followed by";<br>
it's one of the basic properties by which one might seek<br>
to characterize an abstract algebra. Divergence can<br>
mean the opposite of convergence, but it also refers<br>
to a quantity in vector mechanics, and this seems the<br>
most sensible interpretation. Let's assume that we're<br>
interested in the divergence of some field in this<br>
second sense. Then what is it that the divergence does not <br>
commute with?  Perhaps the divergence takes values in a <br>
noncommutative algebra in this region? But I find it hard to <br>
see why the divergence wouldn't then take values from that <br>
same algebra everywhere else.<br>
<p>
So the main problem here is to give a nontrivial meaning to<br>
the notion of "noncommutative divergence". One way out<br>
is to assume that by "noncommutative" we mean not commuting<br>
with a *particular element* of the algebra of divergence values.<br>
Since we are apparently dealing with tensor quantities<br>
this is no great mystery - most matrices do not commute.<br>
<p>
The final stumbling block is that it is the *locus* which<br>
is said to have a "divergence". A locus is a region, so<br>
we might suppose that when we talk about the divergence<br>
of the locus, we are integrating divergence across the <br>
locus. But what do we mean by *the* locus of the<br>
contravariant tensor? The expression "the locus of X"<br>
normally would mean "the region in which X can be<br>
found". But then we would be saying "the divergence<br>
of the region is noncommutative in a particular region",<br>
which does not make obvious sense. Therefore we are<br>
probably using the term "locus" as a shorthand for<br>
some already introduced expression, for example<br>
"locus of points for which ... has the same value<br>
as it does at the current point".<br>
<p>
So the complete translation of our original statement<br>
might run:<br>
<p>
"But Arthur C. Clarke has already told us that the <br>
integral of the divergence of the contravariant tensor<br>
(over a constant-valued neighborhood of the point we <br>
are considering), in the region of the transfinite<br>
singularity, does not commute with e (where e is <br>
some privileged element of the divergence algebra)!"<br>
<p>
Constructing a function for which this is true,<br>
and a context in which it makes sense to point all<br>
this out, is left as an exercise for the reader.<br>
