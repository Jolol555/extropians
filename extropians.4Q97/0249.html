<i>&gt; I recently read that BT Labs are predicting Quantum Computers for 2004, which</i><br>

<p>
The British Telecom labs web page has an interesting chart showing when<br>
their "resident futurist" thinks various technologies will arise, at:<br>

I'll say this for the guy, he's not timid.  He must have about 300<br>
different technological events laid out on a timeline spanning the<br>
next few decades, spread over his 12 pages.  To me his dates generally<br>
look early, but I'm not going to sit back and take potshots at them.<br>
The sheer volume of predictions is impressive even if they don't turn<br>
out to be too accurate.<br>

P.S. Somehow I doubt that IBM is using teleportation as a means for<br>
faster than light communication, mainstream reporting or not.<br>
