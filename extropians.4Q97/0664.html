Well, you *do* have the new information that your present <br>
consciousness-moment exists after the coin toss rather than before.<br>
This observation is more likely given that a larger fraction of all<br>
consciousness-moments exist after the coin toss than before it than<br>
given that there are equally many consciousness-moments before as<br>
after. Using this difference in conditional probabilities, together<br>
with Bayes' theorem, you can give a Bayesian justification (contra<br>
Eliezer) why you should make a shift in this case.<br>
