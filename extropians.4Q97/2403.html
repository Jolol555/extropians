<i>&gt; This is a side issue from the FTL "teleportation" story, but does anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; know if travelling backwards in time is theoretically excluded by General</i><br>
<i>&gt; Relativity or any other physical theory.</i><br>
<p>
CTCs (closed timelike curves) are possible in general relativity, but<br>
it is not clear if they can occur or be created in physically<br>
reasonable worlds (the chronology protection conjecture says they are<br>
impossible, but it is just a conjecture). Quantum mechanics seems to<br>
be time reversible, on the quantum level there is no real distinction<br>
between past and future (as far as we know). One interesting<br>
possibility is that quantum mechanics rules out arbitrary time travel<br>
because (gross oversimplification) virtual particles could follow the<br>
CTCs around and around, causing a buildup of vacuum energy that<br>
destoys the time machine (see the papers on wormhole physics by<br>
Visser). On the other hand, Novikov has shown that quantum mechanics<br>
may allow time travel as long as it remains consistent: no paradoxes<br>
are possible because actions that would cause them are prevented by<br>
quantum effects, they simply do not happen.<br>
<p>
The conclusion seems to be that it may be possible, but likely very<br>
constrained. But the universe is a weird place, and weird things may<br>
be possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If reverse time-travel is possible, then I guess (should we fail to</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieve biological immortality in our lifetimes) we have a chance of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; "rescued" by future humans once time travel is invented. In this way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; anybody who has ever lived is potentially immortal if they can be snatched</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the past.</i><br>
<p>
This is untestable, so we cannot rely on it.<br>
