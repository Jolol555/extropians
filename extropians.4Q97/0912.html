<i>&gt;  century. </i><br>
<p>
A couple of observations.  First, I am seeing more and more transhuman and<br>
extropic ideas discussed in the popular media and popping up in odd places.<br>
 As I've mentioned a few times, it seems that Forbes magazine's editorial<br>
staff has some not-so-closet extropians on it.  And, as an example of the<br>
latter phenomenon, just the other day in a meeting, a 50-ish lawyer said to<br>
me that he wished he had a computer connected to the net all the time he<br>
could carry in his pocket and view through his glasses.  This fellow was not<br>
particularly "advanced" in his thinking otherwise -- in fact, I would call<br>
him a decided "good old boy" in his cultural mein.  One of my young<br>
associates looked across the room at me with raised eyebrows when the older<br>
lawyer said this, as if to say "Man, this crazy stuff you've been talking<br>
about might be right, after all!"  These sorts of isolated events have a way<br>
of adding up to something more than just quantitative change at a certain<br>
point.<br>
<p>
Second, Anders' point about how the "establishment" reacts to<br>
paradigm-challenging matters made me think of something I read this morning<br>
in "The Passions of the Western Mind."  Apparently the idea that the Church<br>
was immediately and adamantly opposed to the heliocentric theory is actually<br>
a simplistic generalization.  In fact, Copernicus was a respected adviser to<br>
the papacy, his work was patronized by leading clerics throughout his life<br>
and the text of his book was part of the curriculum in some church<br>
institutions.  It was only when heliocentrism became identified with a<br>
broader front of challenge to the church that folks got burned at the stake<br>
for it.  Perhaps there's a lesson there for those who would engage in<br>
guerilla memetics . . .<br>
