It might be that the discussion bogs down in different definitions for the<br>
same words.  <br>
<p>
I'm assuming that `phenomenal' is being posited by contrast to `noumenal' -<br>
that it denotes the inward experience of things outside consciousness, via<br>
sensory registration and cognitive mapping of a conjectured world of<br>
things-in-themselves.  <br>
<p>
Those noumenal things might be fields of force, or hosts of angels, or<br>
computer lists in a higher-dimensional space... but for the terminology to<br>
be useful, we assume with Kant that noumena are inaccessible, in their<br>
suchness, to human awareness and apprehension.  <br>
<p>
So of course, on this usage, redness cannot be on the far side of our eyes.<br>
 It's an experience, a construct, a phenomenon.  (The trouble with this<br>
traditional philosophical usage is that it stumbles over the common usage<br>
where `phenomenon' is taken to denote a bounded thing or activity in the<br>
world.  Pity about that.)<br>
