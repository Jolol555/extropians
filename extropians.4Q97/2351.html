<i>&gt; as a 1.  This agreement would have to happen subluminally, but what if I</i><br>

<i>&gt; that be FTL communication?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If i read correctly, the problem is that the system doesn't always work.<br>
It works 25 % of the time now and they think they can get it up to 75 %<br>
(theoretical limit?) so you would never know which one of the photons was<br>
correctly transmitted or not.  Now, would CRC and parity<br>
bit/photon checking help for such a low reliability rate?<br>
