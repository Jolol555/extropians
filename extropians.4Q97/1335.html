<p>
It is not controversial, this has been known for a while among<br>
demographers. Education may not be the solution to *everything*, but<br>
it comes close :-)<br>
<p>
I have been thinking of what basis we should evaluate technology<br>
on. At least on this list it seems very logical to start with the<br>
Extropian Principles and the basic concept of extropy.<br>
<p>
In the section on Intelligent Technology Max writes:<br>
<p>
	We will co-evolve with the products of our minds, integrating<br>
	with them, finally merging with our intelligent technology in<br>
	a posthuman synthesis, amplifying our abilities and extending<br>
	our freedom.<br>
<p>
This suggests strongly that the extropian view of technology is that<br>
it is a tool to amplify extropy. Technology that amplifies extropy<br>
well is good technology, technology that decreases extropy is bad<br>
technology. Extropy is defined as:<br>
<p>
	EXTROPY: A measure of intelligence, information, energy, life,<br>
	experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth. The collection<br>
	of forces which oppose entropy.<br>
<p>
So the Internet is in general good technology, not just because it is<br>
useful (what?! The net useful? :-) but also because it embodies<br>
positive values to us. On the other hand television is in some<br>
respects a non-extropian technology since it promotes a identical<br>
broadcasts to a passive audience aimed the lowest common denominator<br>
(while at the same time it gives experience and information). So an<br>
extropian critique of the Internet would focus on how to make the net<br>
more extropic and safeguard it against becoming a new television<br>
medium. <br>
<p>
Note that the above definitions suggests that polluting technology<br>
(beside being wasteful) is also strongly entropic; extropianism has an<br>
environmental ethos at its core, it is just not expressed in the<br>
conventional sense and may extend to all complex systems.<br>
<p>
Another quote from the Principles:<br>
<p>
	We favor careful and cautious development of powerful<br>
	technologies, but will neither stifle evolutionary advancement<br>
	nor cringe before the unfamiliar. Regarding timidity and<br>
	stagnation as unworthy of us, we choose to stride valiantly<br>
	into the future.<br>
<p>
This clearly rejects arguments from unfamiliarity and "if we don't<br>
know if it is dangerous, let's assume it is", while pointing out that<br>
we want to rationally evaluate the technology. After all, we plan to<br>
be living with it. Rational risk analysis, open technology and public<br>
discussions are to be promoted, and technologies that attempt to avoid<br>
this are inherently suspect (e.g. see the comments about secret<br>
cryptosystems in the PGP manual).<br>
