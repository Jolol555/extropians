Isn't the amount of energy required for transmission of more concern <br>
than using the available bandwidth to it's limit. I.e. is using <br>
a directed and focused beam instead of using a unidirectional <br>
pulsating star for transmission, a lot more energy efficient. <br>
Also by directing a focused beam you can prevent your <br>
"enemies" from detecting anything. (No need for stealth.)<br>
<p>
If you're using a pulsating star to transmit a unidirectional signal<br>
then <br>
it seems that the purpose is to get attention instead of hiding <br>
yourself or your transmission.<br>
<p>
Furthermore a signal totally indistinguishable from random noise, so <br>
without any redundancy, will not be able to correct any errors <br>
created by damage to the signal, and should therefore not be <br>
practical.<br>
<p>
(Indistinguishable from noise, that means every single photon <br>
should carry an important bit of information. So the loss of a <br>
single photon should result in loss of information.)<br>
