        Yes, this is mostly true.  Since sheep farming is one of the few<br>
profitable agricultural practices in that part of Africa, farmers have to<br>
let their sheep graze.  Since grass and other vegetation is what keeps the<br>
soil moist and full of nutrients, its removal (combined with the hot<br>
climate) quickly leaches the soil of nutrients and moisture, causing it to<br>
become brittle and dusty.  Whenever a gust of wind comes along, it<br>
virtually pushes the dry topsoil into nearby areas, usually causing them to<br>
be buried. The process of desertification is a constant one...one that is<br>
not so much affected by the climate as by poor farming habits.<br>
Unfortunately, due to the poverty of the area, such subsistance farming is<br>
necessary; the result is a catch-22.  The ideal solution to desertification<br>
would be for the farmers to find a new way to support themselves; however,<br>
given the climate and potential industries of the area, few alternatives<br>
come to mind.<br>
