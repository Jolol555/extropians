Good suggestion!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since you have a link to "Engines of Creation" you may wish to add a link</i><br>

<p>
I'm on a slippery slope. Unbounding the Future is distinctly popular. <br>
EoC is popular too, but it is so damn brilliant that it is impossible <br>
not to include it. I think I will abstain from UF.<br>

I will have a think about that. What I think I want to avoid is <br>
linking to anything I find interesting. There are already a number of <br>
excellent transhumanist sites with hundreds of links (e.g. Ander's <br>
and Mitch's). But some people when they come to a site might rather <br>
want five or ten limks that lead to really good central texts. If <br>
they want a more exhaustive bibliography they can use AltaVista.<br>
