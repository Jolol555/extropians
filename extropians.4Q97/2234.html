Not even that expensive. There are an estimated 3-5 million tons of<br>
surplus cargo ships world wide just sitting in harbors, collecting rust.<br>
These could easily be sailed south and scuttled. Instant polar reefs....<br>

I tend to think that after several billion years, that the earth is<br>
pretty good at maintaining an even keel within its own system. its dealt<br>
with extreme vulanism, etc. for millions of years, and the bulk of the<br>
climactic variation over time has more been a matter of a change in the<br>
solar flux levels.<br>
<p>
Also, considering that we've found a repreive of a few years,<br>
supposedly, from the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, if the greenhouse effect<br>
is really happening, all we need to do to fix it is clean nuke a few<br>
volcanos.<br>
