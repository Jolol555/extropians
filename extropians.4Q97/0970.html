Bernie, hold on.  Nick's response to your query about the difference between<br>
transhuman is not a distilled explanation.  Granted, some extropians might<br>
approach their political views from an anarcho-capitalist view, but this is<br>
not inclusive of all extropians and certainly there is no doctrine that<br>
states that an extropian maintain this type of political slant.<br>
<p>
Many extropians are libertarians, however there are numerous extropians that<br>
neither subscribe to anarcho-capitalist views nor libertarian views.  They<br>
have formed their own concepts about government, its relationship to our<br>
well being.<br>
