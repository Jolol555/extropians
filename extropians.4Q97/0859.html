	Actually, the TA is correct.  If you take the total amount of healthcare <br>
provided divided by the total dollars, one would find the highest value <br>
achieved under public healthcare systems, due to economy of scale (which <br>
means that if you buy a whole bunch of something it's cheaper per item).<br>
<p>
	Think about it.  As was explained to me, imagine that you had to go make a <br>
pencil from scratch.  You had to grow the tree, mine the lead, the whole <br>
bit.  Think of how much work it would be to make one pencil.  Now, think of <br>
the little bit more work to make an additional pencil.  The work per pencil <br>
drops.<br>
<p>
	The real problem (IMnot-soHO) people on this list have with public <br>
healthcare, is that one person should not be forced to pay for another's <br>
healthcare.<br>
<p>
	A smaller problem deals with the fact of when you make something available <br>
to everybody for free, soon there isn't much left (as you may have noticed <br>
the last time you tried to get something for nothing).<br>
