: I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can<br>

:<br>
: 1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  But as long as<br>
: there's a profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people<br>
: will always attempt to do so.<br>
:<br>
: 2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.<br>
: Of course, this imposition would go against Libertarian values.<br>
:<br>
: This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and<br>
: libertarianism: sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually<br>
: the only way to get everyone to adhere is with guns, which means<br>
: fascism.<br>
:<br>
: Can anyone talk me out of this?<br>
<p>
Start with "guns ... means fascism."  I'll assume you don't literally<br>
mean fascism as Mussolini meant it (state management of the economy<br>
while retaining the form of private ownership) but rather dictatorship<br>
in general, or perhaps even use of force in general.  If you shoot<br>
someone who tries to rape your sister, are you a fascist?  I hope<br>
you don't think that.<br>
<p>
Weapons don't mean dictatorship.  *Concentration* of weapons in<br>
the hands of an elite means dictatorship over the disarmed masses.<br>
Where weapons are widespread, dictatorship becomes far more difficult.<br>
(I hear that Albania is quieter now that most households have<br>
machine-guns looted from the army!)<br>
<p>
I have no desire to "impose libertarianism" on people who enjoy<br>
paying taxes, or enjoy having their choices arbitrarily restricted.<br>
If you want to go to jail for smoking a joint, okay, I won't stop you.<br>
If you want to have your business seized for hiring an undocumented<br>
immigrant, okay, different strokes.  If you want to pay higher prices<br>
for goods and services provided by the state-certified cartel, fine,<br>
go right ahead.<br>
<p>
But I claim the right to defend myself against aggression, which<br>
includes aggression by tax-collectors and narcs.  I reserve the<br>
right to "impose libertarianism" on *them* only insofar as they<br>
attempt to impose socialism or puritanism on me or my friends.<br>
<p>
In my favorite scenario (not necessarily the most likely) for a<br>
libertarian transition, there's no upheaval; people just stop<br>
cooperating with Big Brother, until it collapses of its own weight.<br>
There will be an uneasy period, as everybody waits for the<br>
"inevitable" crime wave - but I bet it won't happen.  As the<br>
drug trade comes from underground into daylight, violence should<br>
decline; and as trades formerly made uneconomical by taxes or<br>
regulations suddenly become profitable, many petty criminals<br>
will find they've got better things to do.<br>
