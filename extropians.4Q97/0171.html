<p>
The physics in such a would  be much simpler than in ours but just as in ours <br>
the laws of physics are only half the picture, the other half is initial <br>
conditions. Because there is more than one way to produce a pattern in Life <br>
you can not run the game backwards to find those initial conditions.<br>

<i>        &gt;Right and wrong are objective facts, and not facts which we or *any*         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;volitional agent were consulted about.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If so then I see no reason to obey its principles, even if I knew them. I'll <br>
make objective morality a deal, I won't bother it if it won't bother me.<br>
<p>
             <br>
<i>        &gt;For all we know, the Holocaust was a wonderful thing   </i><br>
      <br>
<p>
There is only one way anybody could convince me that the Holocaust was a  <br>
wonderful thing, send in their Nanomachines and massively rewire my brain, <br>
and even then "I" wouldn't be convinced because the resulting creature would  <br>
be so radically different that it would no longer be me. If objective morality<br>
says mass murder is good then I say objective morality can kiss my ass  <br>
because subjective morality is better.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What we are evolved to regard as "right" is as irrelevant as the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;numbers we evolved to see as "real". </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Irrelevant to who?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Right and wrong are objective facts, and not facts which we or *any*         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;volitional agent were consulted about. [...] True right and wrong         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;are outside of our opinions and unaffected by &gt;them.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If there is an objective morality then I agree that our opinions do not <br>
effect it, and I would go further and say that objective morality does not <br>
effect our opinions. If we do not effect it and it does not effect us then <br>
Ockham's Razor says that the Objective Morality Theory is not needed. <br>
Einstein did not prove that the luminiferous ether was nonexistent, he only <br>
proved that the idea was silly, but that was enough<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You and I can no more affect right and wrong that way than we can         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;flatten the Earth.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then "morality" doesn't need your help so don't worry about it, let it keep <br>
doing whatever in the world it's doing, and if anybody asks your opinion about  <br>
starting a second Holocaust keep advising them that it's a very bad idea.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;With respect to ethics, you can't prevail over some higher authority </i><br>
        <br>
             <br>
So all objective ethics means is that if somebody more powerful than yourself  <br>
tells you not to do something then you'd better not do it? In some cases that  <br>
might be good advice but seems a bit anticlimactic for such a grand concept.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You can either be wrong, or right. Opinions are either wrong or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;right.                    </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't like sweet potatoes. Am I right or wrong?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's as if a debate over the shape of the Earth was being conducted,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;where one side wanted to know what the shape "really" was and the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other fought valiantly for freedom of opinion and decried any side         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that tyranically declared a single truth, or even that a single      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;truth existed. </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
No, it's not like the shape of the Earth, it's as if the debate was over  <br>
whether the Three Stooges were funny. Suppose you watch a film of the stooges  <br>
and laugh, but then somebody says "Yudkowsky you have made an error, that  <br>
joke was not funny. I have found that Objective Humor exists and with my  <br>
comic algorithm I can calculate the humor content of any message string to  <br>
16 decimal places and do it in polynomial time. The calculation proves  <br>
conclusively that the joke was not even slightly funny, it produced a zero." <br>
<p>
And yet you still laughed. "Objective Humor" didn't think it was funny, but  <br>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky did.                        <br>
