Whether "global warming" is currently occurring or will occur in the<br>
future is somewhat controversial.  Forced reductions in the emissions<br>
of "greenhouse gases" is currently the main strategy proposed when<br>
governmental policy makers consider the topic.  Is there an<br>
alternative or complementary approach?  If the effect is real then<br>
some interesting mega-engineering might be attempted.  Below are some<br>
proposals that have been considered by the National Academy of<br>
Sciences.  Of course, some of these proposals can be criticized for<br>
ignoring unintended consequences, being unrealistic, or being<br>
hubristic, etc. But they are fun, and one or more of them might work<br>
in a desirable fashion. We should not foreclose options.<br>
<p>
Space Mirror's: Place 50,000 100 km^2 mirror's in Earth's orbit to<br>
reflect incoming sunlight.<br>
<p>
Stratospheric Dust: Use guns or balloons to maintain a dust cloud in<br>
the stratosphere to increase the sunlight reflection.<br>
<p>
Stratospheric Bubbles: Place billions of aluminized, hydrogen-filled<br>
balloons in the stratosphere to provide a reflective screen.<br>
<p>
Low Stratospheric Dust: Use aircraft to maintain a cloud of dust in<br>
the low stratosphere to reflect sunlight<br>
<p>
Low Stratospheric Soot: Decrease efficiency of burning in engines of<br>
aircraft flying in the low stratosphere to maintain a thin cloud of<br>
soot to intercept sunlight.<br>
<p>
Cloud Stimulation: Burn Sulfur in ships or power plants to form<br>
sulfate aerosol in order to stimulate additional low marine clouds to<br>
reflect sunlight.<br>
<p>
Ocean Biomass Stimulation: Place iron in the oceans to stimulate<br>
generation of CO_2-absorbing phytoplankton.<br>
<p>
Atmospheric CFC Removal: Use lasers to break up CFCs in the atmosphere.<br>
<p>
Reforestation: Reforest 28.7 Mha of economically or environmentally<br>
marginal crop and pasture lands and nonfederal forest lands to<br>
sequester 10 percent of U.S. CO_2 emissions.<br>
<p>
Nuclear: Replace all existing fossil-fuel-fired plants with nuclear<br>
power plants such as advanced light-water reactors.<br>
<p>
Methanol from Biomass: Replace all existing gasoline vehicles with<br>
those that use methanol produced from biomass.<br>
<p>
Solar Photovoltaics: Replace fossil-fuel-fired plants with solar<br>
photovoltaics generation potential of 2.5 quads.<br>
<p>
The National Academy of Sciences report that considers these proposals<br>
and many others is available on the web.<br>

Look at Chapter Six for mitigation strategies.<br>

I found out about this report by reading Gregory Benford's cover<br>
article in the November issue of Reason magazine that is also<br>
available on the web.<br>

Blurb from magazine: If we treated global warming as a technical<br>
problem instead of a moral outrage, we could cool the world.<br>
