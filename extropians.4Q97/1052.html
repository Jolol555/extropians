The speed of light in a vacuum is EXACTLY c for ANY observer.<br>
<p>

<p>
Relative to anything.<br>

<p>
<p>
I hope not, because if so that means logic must be inconsistent. We know from <br>
experiment that Galilean or even Newtonian physics is wrong.            <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;once you abandon locality -- see Bell, Aspect etc.),     </i><br>
 <br>
<p>
Aspect proved experimentally that Bell's inequality is violated and that <br>
means weird quantum effects that move instantly and  do not weaken with <br>
distance do exist, but as these effects can carry neither energy nor <br>
information I don't see the relevance to the Big Bang or General Relativity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;velocity addition is clearly demonstrable as well as being logically         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;necessary.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Rubbish.<br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;there is a constant process of absorption and re-emission as photons         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;travel from A to B         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The index of refraction is a measure of how much a substance will slow down <br>
light, water is pretty dense so light is only about 80% as fast as in a  <br>
vacuum for example. <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there is no perfect vacuum in space       </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But pretty damn close, on average about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. <br>
Radiation is only scattered if the particles are about the same size as the <br>
wavelength of  the photon, yet the redshift has been detected from radio <br>
waves to X rays, an enormous range, and the shift is always exactly the same <br>
for all wavelengths. This can not be the cause of the redshift.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;some of the most perfect vacuums around are probably right here on       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;Earth.       </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nope, we can't even get close.      <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In space, the free electrons are particularly voracious absorbers         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and emitters of photons.  </i><br>
<p>
OK.  <br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;The photons perform _work_ on the electrons as they're absorbed and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;re-emitted.  They move the electrons around. </i><br>
   <br>
You're still on solid ground.<br>
   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;et. al.) is the cause of the cosmic (Hubble) redshift, which is of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;course directly proportional to the distance stellar photons have to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;travel to get here.</i><br>
   <br>
<p>
And now you enter the Twilight Zone. All elements produce a unique set of <br>
emission and absorption lines in their electromagnetic spectrum, a redshift <br>
means that the information on the  relative position of these lines is <br>
preserved, they're just "shifted" to a longer wavelength. There are only 2 <br>
things known to science that can produce a redshift:<br>
<p>
 1) The Doppler effect.<br>
<p>
 2) Gravity. (an effect discovered by Einstein by the way)<br>
<p>
The huge redshift seen in distant galaxies does not produce fuzzy lines but <br>
sharp ones, so the gravitational field would not only have to be enormous but <br>
also constant over thousands of light years, over an entire galaxy. Nothing  <br>
known to science can produce a gravitational field like that. It also seems  <br>
very strange that the gravitational field of all objects is proportional to  <br>
their distance from a small planet called Earth.<br>
<p>
You claim to have found a third way to produce a redshift, some sort of <br>
mysterious inter galactic gas, well that's jim dandy, but until you can show <br>
me the stuff and let me watch it do its thing in the lab your theory remains <br>
just that, gas.<br>

         <br>

        <br>
<p>
I sense desperation, I can't think of any other reason you would invoke the <br>
name of a man dead for 300 years to dismiss with a wave of your hand hard <br>
experimental data obtained in this very decade. I also note  that in my last <br>
post whenever I mentioned a scientific fact in favor of the  Big Bang your <br>
only rebuttal was to tell me to read books by various philosophers but that <br>
just doesn't wash. It's science that must give marching orders to philosophy <br>
not the other way round.<br>

<i>        &gt;time!!!  </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Yea yea, I've heard it a million times, cosmologists are hiding evidence and  <br>
engaged in a huge conspiracy of silence, probably related to the JFK  <br>
assassination, UFOs, and that car that runs on water.                                   <br>
<p>
<p>

<i>        &gt;very well, actually.</i><br>

Does it produce a blackbody spectrum? Is the temperature close to 2.7 degrees <br>

<p>
<i>        &gt;You've been reading too many childrens' histories of physics!        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I need your help to explain something, I can't ask momey or daddy because <br>
it's  past my bedtime and I'm not supposed to be playing with the computer <br>
this late. If I'm wrong then at least one of the following 3 things must be <br>
true  but I can't figure out which one:<br>
<p>
 1) The Big Bang was known at the turn of the century and popular because    <br>
    those naughty logical positivists loved it so much.<br>
<p>
 2) The Big Bang did not become popular in the 60's.<br>
<p>
 3) Despite the fact that The Big Bang theory was the only one that predicted     <br>
    universal blackbody microwave radiation and said how hot it would be, <br>
    when evidence for it was actually found nobody was impressed and most of <br>
    the advocates of competing theories did not conceded defeat.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;TRUTH has a central regulating role in values AND facts.       </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Science is about what is, morality is about what we want, confusing the two  <br>
is disastrous to both. Consider Lysenko's nitwit communist genetics or the <br>
social darwinist's nitwit morality.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If General Relativity depicts a four-dimensional Parmenidean Block         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Universe, within which nothing ever changes, and in which free will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is a delusion, I _choose_ to say 'to Hell with it.'           </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't get me started on free will, I spent months debating that topic on this <br>
list.<br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;"The statement 'God exists' has meaning, and it may even be true.          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;But since there is no conceivable observation which could _refute_         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;such a statement, it is _unscientific_." -- Bryan Magee, 'Popper.' </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
OK, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs? The Big Bang can  <br>
be refuted, at least in theory, but nobody has done it yet. <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;He [Einstein] thought GR was wrong, and spent decades trying to come         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;up with 'a more realistic theory' </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Nonsense. Like all scientific theories General Relativity does not cover <br>
everything, it says nothing about the strong or weak nuclear forces, Einstein <br>
spent the last 20 years of his life trying to extend it into those areas and <br>
he failed, but that certainly doesn't mean General Relativity is wrong. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;His theory is methodologically flawed and empirically falsified.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Empirically falsified? In his first paper Einstein predicted that the <br>
precession of Mercury's perihelion should shift by 43 seconds of arc a <br>
century more than Newton says it should.  It does. <br>
<p>
In the same paper Einstein said that light from a star that just grazes the <br>
surface of the sun should be deflected by 1.75 seconds of arc. It is.<br>
<p>
General Relativity predict that time runs slower in a gravitational field,  <br>
such as on the surface of the Earth than it does in open space far from any <br>
large mass. Because it's a scientific and not just a philosophical theory it <br>
can give you numbers and tell you exactly how much slower, just use the<br>
following formula:<br>
<p>
                 __________<br>
                /     v^2<br>
               /  1 - ---<br>
            \/       c^2<br>
<p>
<p>
If you plug in v as the Earth's escape velocity at the surface, about 7 miles  <br>
per second, and c as the speed of light in a vacuum, 186000 miles a second,  <br>
you find that a clock on the Earth's surface is only running 99.99999993%  as <br>
fast as a clock in deep space. This has been confirmed experimentally and has<br>
become important commercially. Global Positioning Satellites contain atomic <br>
clocks and send out timing signals, they enable a receiving station to <br>
calculate his position within a few inches, if General Relativity was not <br>
taken into account this would not be possible, instead we have a multi <br>
billion dollar industry.<br>
    <br>
The gravitational field on the second story of a house is a little weaker <br>
than it is on the first story 10 feet below, General Relativity predicts that <br>
time will run slower down there, 3 parts in 10^16 slower.  Incredibly even <br>
this tiny difference has been detected experimentally, and it was done more <br>
than 30 years ago, using the Mossbauer effect for which he received the Nobel <br>
prize.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The universe may or may not be infinite but it is certainly not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Euclidean, if it were gravity could not exist. </i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;That verges on the absurd ... Relational or Faradayan or Newtonian         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or Graviton-mediated gravitational force gets along just fine in a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Euclidean framework.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, and they get along just fine with your philosophy, but they don't agree <br>
with experiment, in such a confrontation the victor is clear. Your philosophy  <br>
may insist that an instrument produce a certain reading but if it stubbornly  <br>
refuses to do so then its time to find a new philosophy. <br>
<p>
Aristotle was like you, he somehow deduced from pure philosophy that women <br>
have fewer teeth than men. They don't. Aristotle had a wife, he could have <br>
counted her teeth at any time but never bothered because he already knew the <br>
answer, or thought he did.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What the hell are you talking about?  GR?</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Give that man a cigar.<br>
<p>
By the way, if as you say the universe is infinite in all directions and thus <br>
is infinitely old and has an infinite number of stars, how do you explain <br>
Olber's Paradox. Why is the sky dark at night? <br>
<p>
Pick any point in the night sky and extend a line from you to that point, <br>
eventually the line will hit the surface of a star, so the entire sky should <br>
be as bright as the sun. Put it another way, all the light emitted by an <br>
infinite number of stars would have nowhere to go, it would accumulate and <br>
vaporize the earth. Your interstellar gas would be no help because it would  <br>
heat up too.<br>
<p>
The Big Bang theory has no trouble with Olber because light from stars more <br>
than 20 billion light years away has not had time to reach us yet.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;An infinite Universe has nowhere to expand _into_. Right?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Wrong. I'm the manager of a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms and <br>
all are occupied, you walk in and ask for a room. No problem, I just tell <br>
guest #1 to move to room 2, 2 to move to  3, 3 to move to 4 ect.  <br>
<p>
An infinite number of guests walk in and ask for a room. No problem, I just  <br>
tell guest #1 to move to room 2, 2 to move to 4, 4 to move to 8 ect.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, the universe does not expand into space, space itself is  <br>
expanding.          <br>
