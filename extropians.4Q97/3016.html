<i>&gt; One of the greatest problems facing Humanity is the spread of infectious</i><br>
<i>&gt; diseases.  </i><br>
<p>
I understand pre-industrial societies suffer frequent and deadly<br>
epidemics of many  infectious diseases, flus, pnemonias, TB, smallpox. <br>
<p>
However, today infectious disease constitutes only a small % of all<br>
causes of death in the industrial world. Improving general sanitary<br>
conditions and nutrition, improvements in shelter, etc., seems<br>
correlated with declining mortality from infectious diseases. In the US,<br>
mortality rates for diptheria, whooping cough, smallpox, etc were<br>
falling precipitously before the widespread introduction of vaccines. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some may consider the diseases they harbor a matter of privacy and decry</i><br>
<i>&gt; the governments' actions, while others (I believe the majority) will</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider it a public safety issue and believe that no one has the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to (knowingly or unknowingly) infect others with deadly or debilitating</i><br>
<i>&gt; diseases.</i><br>
<p>
I'm troubled by the entire concept of public health, which is based on<br>
the notion that a healthy lifestyle is not a matter of personal<br>
responsibility, but also a government management imperative. Its' tools<br>
are quarantines, mass immunizations, control of food<br>
and water supplies, aggressive family planning programs, expensive<br>
"wars" against cancer and AIDS, and regulating or restricting access to<br>
alternative health therapies or dietary supplements.  <br>
<p>
When it comes to some crucial health matters, the state often does not<br>
allow minority views. And there is no guarantee that the opinion<br>
expressed by the FDA or NIH or CDC are correct. <br>
<p>
Here's 2 examples...<br>
<p>
1. Many people think that child hood vaccinations are safe, effective,<br>
and should be mandatory, and that those that disagree are needlessly<br>
endangering their children and others. Others point out that deaths from<br>
these diseases had already plummeted before the vaccinations were<br>
introduced, and that vaccinations carry their own risks. Further, some<br>
argue that vaccinations prevent the full maturation of the immune<br>
system. <br>
<p>
Whether I agree with them or not, I will allow them their minority view.<br>
I would also want the state out of the vaccination biz, including<br>
limiting the liability of vaccination companies. <br>
<p>
2. Many people think the government was right when it told us HIV=AIDS<br>
and launched a billion dollar War on AIDS.  Others argue that this has<br>
been a collossal mistake:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/analy.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/analy.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/turno.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/turno.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.duesberg.com/ch3.html">http://www.duesberg.com/ch3.html</a><br>
<p>
Whether I agree with them or not, I will allow their minority view. If<br>
they are right, then the War on AIDS has been a tragic mistake. <br>
<p>
I would be wary of even more government control of our health.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be screened for disease periodically.  </i><br>
<p>
Likely, but is it desireable?<br>
<p>
For example, there are good arguments that the AIDS test is non<br>
specific:<br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot1.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot1.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot2.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot2.html</a><br>
<p>
and that HIV has never been properly isolated:<br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation1.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation1.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation2.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation2.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation3.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation3.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html">http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html</a><br>
<p>
So there is a minority (myself included) who would be opposed to state<br>
imposed mandatory screening for AIDS, for example. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What if humans developed a procedure which could detect most or all known</i><br>
<i>&gt; infectious diseases in a human that was fairly fast (&lt; 2 hours) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly inexpensive (&lt; US $100)?  </i><br>
<p>
Than those humans should quickly market their procedure and make<br>
millions. <br>
<p>
Should the state take over this development and oversee its benfocent<br>
use, IMHO, no. Should the state be picking which labs to fund and which<br>
diseases to target? IMHO, no. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; for achieving this goal?</i><br>
<p>
Increase the wealth of individuals (this will improve their nutrition,<br>
shelter, etc). Allow a full liability free market in health, replace the<br>
FDA with private sector certification, get the state out of the health<br>
care biz.<br>
