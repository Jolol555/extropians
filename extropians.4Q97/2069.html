Geoff -- I assure you that I *do* proceed carefully with unknown packages<br>
in the mail. There could easily be more than one Unabomber out there. I<br>
*know* there are growing numbers of people who hate me and other vocal<br>
extropians. You raise an excellent point about the security of members<br>
information. I'm open to suggestions. We have been pretty careful about<br>
that information. If members feel it warranted, we could be even more<br>
careful such as having a policy of never renting out the list and only<br>
exchanging it for lists of other organizations we are utterly sure of (this<br>
has, in effect, been our practice anyway).<br>
<p>

<p>
Geoff, *you* didn't infuriate me, that was the prof. of surgery who took<br>
the cheap parting shot that I was unable to respond to. I didn't think you<br>
were assuming I drove a Mercedes, but you did make it sound like maybe the<br>
situation was a bit like that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, I do so the need for more money to ExI.  I guess I</i><br>
<i>&gt;still hope that you will not get this money by charging to contribute to</i><br>
<i>&gt;this list.</i><br>
<p>
We are not charging to contribute to the list. We are charging for<br>
membership, one of the benefits of which is charging to the list. There is<br>
a difference! There is no separate list charge.<br>
<p>
  I think this list is a wonderful place for newbies to watch<br>
<i>&gt;for a while, then throw out a couple of replies and watch the seeds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;their ideas grow into new threads.  With a $95 fee, this will become a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rare phenomenon.  </i><br>
<p>
Newbies can still read the list. There is also the Transhuman list. And<br>
there are the newsgroups. This is not an either/or situation.<br>
<p>
Geoff, of course my motivation for the work I've done was not to make<br>
money. But I've come to realize that you cannot run an organization<br>
effectively without sufficient revenue. I've also learned by personal<br>
experience that living in debt at a tiny salary is a stressful way to live,<br>
and not conducive to a happy life nor to a life that includes<br>
life-extending protocols that do not come free.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We will be very happy to work out</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; breaks for members who are not rolling in money and who are contributing in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; other ways. You are such a person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a great idea.</i><br>
<p>
If you are an active member, or want to become an active member, and want<br>
to ask for a break on dues, please get in touch.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
