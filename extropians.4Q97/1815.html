The current model for how the brain works is that it is a network of<br>
interacting neurons.  The neurons interact at points of (near) contact<br>
called synapses.  There, neurons are bombarded with various neurotransmitter<br>
chemicals from nearby neurons.  When a sufficient level of stimulation is<br>
reached, the neuron cell membrane triggers a cascade of events leading to<br>
a nerve impulse.  This travels through the neuron and eventually triggers<br>
it to release its own neurotransmitter chemicals at synapses where it<br>
impinges on other neurons.<br>
<p>
Each neuron works in this conceptually simple way.  The complexity of the<br>
brain arises from the fact that billions or trillions of neurons are<br>
all interacting in a very complex network.  But if we zoom in on any small<br>
portion of it, we see that this simple, essentially mechanical activity is<br>
all that is happening.<br>
<p>
Now it is true that this model is not complete nor is it fully verified.<br>
It could turn out that there are other important effects that are not<br>
yet recognized.  But most people would agree that this model is at least<br>
logically possible.  It might be wrong, but equally it might be right.<br>
There would be no logical inconsistency if it turned out that brains<br>
and neurons actually do work this way, that underlying the complexity<br>
of brains, with all their sensations and qualia, are these simple neural<br>
interactions.<br>
<p>
I am not sure whether Brent believes this.  It almost seems that he is<br>
forced to say that this model must be wrong, that by pure introspection and<br>
reasoning he can conclude that there has to be more to the brain than this.<br>
<p>
The reason is because he does not accept the obvious conclusion of<br>
the neuron-substitution thought experiment.  Given that neurons work<br>
as postulated above, it should be possible to replace a neuron with an<br>
electro-mechanical device.  It works identically to biological neurons at<br>
the inputs and outputs, sensing and emitting neurotransmitter chemicals.<br>
But inside it is a computer, which is designed to exactly mimic the<br>
behavior of the biological neuron it replaces.  When the inputs reach<br>
certain thresholds, it waits for an appropriate delay to simulate the<br>
travel of the neural impulse over the body of the biological neuron,<br>
and then triggers its output mechanism to release neurotransmitters in<br>
the same amount and timing that the biological neuron would have done.<br>
<p>
Substituting this electronic neuron for a biological one cannot change<br>
the behavior of the neural net.  If we imagine two identical brains, with<br>
one of them having a biological neuron replaced by an electronic one,<br>
they will both operate exactly the same.  All the patterns of neural<br>
impulses in the two will be identical.  In particular, everything the<br>
two brains say and do will be the same.  It will not be the case that<br>
one says that it can see normally, while the other says that it seems<br>
to be blind.  That would be a difference in speech patterns which would<br>
require different patterns of nerve impulses in the brain.  But no such<br>
difference will occur because the substitute neuron behaves identically<br>
to the real one as far as patterns of input and output go.<br>
<p>
Even if more biological neurons are replaced, and even if we forego<br>
the need for chemical neurotransmitters at synapses which involve only<br>
electronic neurons, there will still be no changes in the patterns of<br>
activity.  The two brains will remain identical in their nerve firing<br>
patterns.  Each time a neuron fires in the purely biological brain,<br>
the corresponding neuron will fire at exactly that same instant in the<br>
partially electronic one.  So it will not be possible for the two brains<br>
to report any differences in what they perceive.<br>
<p>
Some philosophers suggest that what will happen is that the consciousness<br>
in the partly electronic brain will get "out of sync" with the brain<br>
firing patterns.  It will notice that the qualia are gone, but somehow<br>
it won't be able to report it.  Apparently it will have lost control of<br>
its mouth.  This would presumably lead very quickly to a total disconnect<br>
between the true consciousness, which is panicking at having lost control<br>
of its body, and some other sort of simulated consciousness, which seems to<br>
be going about its life quite normally.  This would then imply that<br>
consciousness apparently has virtually nothing to do with brain activity<br>
since they can behave so independently.  Most people will not go so far<br>
into this form of dualism.<br>
<p>
I think that Brent will suggest instead that the thought experiment won't<br>
work.  It would be impossible to substitute an electronic neuron for a<br>
biological neuron without disrupting the brain's activity.  We have to<br>
assume that our understanding of the brain's mechanisms is incomplete, and<br>
that with further understanding we will find that there are more complex<br>
aspects which no electronic neuron can capture, since it is only modelling<br>
a real biological neuron and is not actually the same as one.<br>
<p>
This is a very strong assertion.  It's not just a matter of saying<br>
"we may be wrong", it's saying, "we must be wrong".  It is saying that<br>
purely by introspection and thinking about the nature of consciousness,<br>
we can _know_ that there is more to the brain's function than the simple<br>
model of interacting neurons I summarized above.<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't find this very convincing, so perhaps my extrapolation<br>
from Brent's postings is wrong.  I am curious to know whether this does<br>
in fact reflect his views.<br>
