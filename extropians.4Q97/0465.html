<p>
My apologies for the misleading language.=A0 By "level off" I actually<br>
meant "continue on a /less than hyperbolic/ growth rate.=A0 Ie, one =<br>
that<br>
does not lead to a vertical asymptote in the graph of computational<br>
power vs. time".<br>
<p>
You seem to agree that this is the likely progression.=A0 Thus my<br>
discomfort with using the term "singularity" to describe such an event.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Vinge's other reason to use the term "singularity" is in the sense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; an event horizon: in his model we cannot predict beyond it because =</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; superintelligences are incomprehensible. I agree with him in this.</i><br>
<p>
But it's not really an event horizon.=A0 It's more like an "event fog"<br>
with our ability to predict getting dimmer and dimmer the deeper we =<br>
look<br>
into that cloud.=A0 Thus my objection to the term "singularity"<br>
<p>
Possibly you're right, and the superintelligences are =<br>
incomprehensible.=A0<br>
However it seems that we should be able to at least generate some<br>
quantitative boundaries on their capabilities given our deepest current<br>
understanding of the laws of physics and mathematics.<br>
<p>
E.g.:<br>
<p>
Given Planck space, c, and the maximum density matter can achieve =<br>
before<br>
collapsing into a black hole, what is the maximum achievable<br>
computational power per unit volume?<br>
<p>
Given the likely mass, age, and size of the universe, and the<br>
constraints listed above, what is the maximum achievable computational<br>
power of the universe?<br>
<p>
Given c, the age, size, and rate of expansion of the universe, how long<br>
would it take an earth-spawned power to infest the galaxy?=A0 1/10e6 of<br>
the universe?=A0 1% of the universe?=A0 10% of the universe?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Chaotic Computability Constraints:=A0 The most ambitious nanotech</i><br>

system.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The structure of any complex object created by this sort of =</i><br>
nanotech<br>

in<br>

to<br>

to<br>

means<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other than trial and error, which have their own pitfalls (e.g.,</i><br>
grey<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; goo).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand. The idea behind nonotech is design to atomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; precision. Assemblers and their output are digitally-described</i><br>
objects.<br>
<i>&gt; a system built by assemblers will be essentially perfectly</i><br>
manufactured<br>
<i>&gt; by comparison to today's systems, in the same way that playing a CD</i><br>
<i>&gt; yields</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same result every time since the recording is digital. Sure, I =</i><br>
can<br>
<i>&gt; conceive of a assembler process using stochastic techniques, but this</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; certainly not necessary.</i><br>
<p>
My understanding may be off here, but let me put forth the reason I see<br>
chaotic computability entering into the picture with nanotech:<br>
<p>
LINEAR NANOTECH<br>
"Linear Nanotech", as I'll call it, is the manipulation of objects at<br>
the atomic scale, one atom at a time.=A0 For example, use of an STM to =<br>
lay<br>
out a company logo on a piece of metal.=A0 As an extension, techniques<br>
that manipulate multiple atoms at a time but can only manipulate a<br>
static number, and which are centrally controlled, are also Linear<br>
Nanotech.=A0 E.g., a multi-head STM.<br>
<p>
PARALLEL NANOTECH<br>
Let's use "Parallel Nanotech" to describe the use of a swarm of<br>
non-reproducing assemblers to transform the source material into the<br>
desired object(s).=A0 Possibly this can be handled without worrying =<br>
about<br>
chaos, though I'm not sure.=A0 The question here is what control system =<br>
is<br>
used to distribute instructions to the appropriate assembler at the<br>
appropriate time.=A0 There are several options in this area, divisible<br>
into two groups:<br>
<p>
Group 1) Control systems requiring central planning and coordination of<br>
the assemblers.=A0 Ie, with electromagnetic signals of some sort I =<br>
could<br>
communicate to each nanite and instruct it in what to do.=A0 Or I could<br>
"draw" the shape of the object I wanted and have different classes of<br>
nanites respond to different signals (which correspond to different<br>
areas).=A0 This requires external planning, analysis of the source<br>
material, and either precise regulation of the source quality and<br>
structure, or on-the-fly recalibration of the output material.=A0 This<br>
type of control seems to avoid the chaotic computability problems but =<br>
is<br>
a much less flexible nanotech than is popularly conceived by nanotech<br>
proponents.<br>
<p>
Group 2) Self-organizing control systems.=A0 The nanites communicate<br>
peer-to-peer to determine the structure and composition of the source<br>
material and negotiate the precise design of the output object.=A0 This<br>
enables a much higher degree of flexibility in relation to source<br>
material, environment the nanites are used in, etc.. It also reduces =<br>
the<br>
burden of external intelligence &amp; processing power to direct the<br>
nanites.=A0<br>
<p>
However, self-organizing control results in a complex system where<br>
characteristics of the outputted object are sensitive to initial<br>
conditions such as the exact composition and structure of the source,<br>
temperature, pressure, atmospheric content, shape &amp; amount of initial<br>
release of the nanites, etc..=A0 This is a chaotic system.=A0 Or more<br>
precisely, if the nanite designer has done her job right, the web of<br>
nanites form a complex, self-organizing system that has a strong<br>
tendency towards certain designs and behaviors.=A0=A0 To do her job =<br>
"right",<br>
though, the nanite designer had to understand the relationship between =<br>
a<br>
change to the nanite design (or instructions) and the physical objects<br>
that the nanites would create.=A0 This involves chaos, or minimally<br>
complexity, because the "intelligence" or "decision making power" of =<br>
the<br>
nanite swarm is an emergent property of that swarm, rather than of any<br>
individual nanite.<br>
<p>
The design process itself suffers the burden of chaotic incomputability<br>
for another reason, essentially the same reasons that we are unable to<br>
determine the precise effects of twiddling with a particular gene:=A0 =<br>
The<br>
characteristics of the phenotype are only /partially/ based on the<br>
genotype, the rest of the influence being a complex sensitivity to the<br>
environment.<br>
<p>
BOOTSTRAP NANOTECH<br>
Beyond Linear and Parallel Nanotech is something I'll dub "Bootstrap<br>
Nanotech", where the assemblers actually use the source material to<br>
reproduce, generating more assemblers which eventually get used to<br>
construct the object you want.=A0 Here the relationship between =<br>
assembler<br>
design and characteristics of the created object is very obviously a<br>
chaotic one.=A0 As may be the relationship between environment =<br>
(structure<br>
and composition of source material) and characteristics of the created<br>
object.<br>
<p>
Perhaps someone more versed in nanotech can explain to us the proposed<br>
control systems, or at least the suggested architecture of such =<br>
systems.<br>
