Amazing.  I must be imagining the Freedom of Information Act, all those<br>
cheap cameras on the market, or that commerical spy satellite someone's<br>
putting up.  Give it away?  "Their own purposes" can consist of selling <br>
the technology to everyone.  And I don't find it implausible that the<br>
gov't would make public camera data public if the public wanted it.  We<br>
do live in something like a democracy, after all.<br>
