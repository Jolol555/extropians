<p>
 My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I<br>
worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was<br>
eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews,  I decided to start my<br>
own business.  In short order, however, I encountered many unforseen<br>
financial problems.  I owed my family, friends, and creditors over<br>
$35,000.  The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just<br>
couldn't seem to make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow<br>
against my home to support my family and struggling business.  I truly<br>
believed it was wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT<br>
something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my<br>
experience in hopes that this will change your life<br>
FOREVER....FINANCIALLY!!!        In mid December, I received this<br>
program via e-mail.  Six months prior to receiving this program I had<br>
been sending away for information on various business opportunities.<br>
All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost<br>
effective.  They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the<br>
initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked<br>
or not.  One claimed I'd make a million dollars in one year...it<br>
didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.        But like I<br>
was saying, in December of '92 I received this program.  I didn't send<br>
for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK<br>
GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I<br>
was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a<br>
MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start,<br>
without putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and paper<br>
and figured it out, I saw I would at least get my money back. After<br>
determining that the program is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I asked<br>
myself "WHY NOT?" and decided to do it.<br>
        Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails.  It only cost me about<br>
$15.00 for my time on-line.  The great thing about e-mail is that I<br>
didn't need any money for printing to send out the program, only the<br>
cost to fulfill my orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it<br>
doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "cheat"<br>
anyone, no matter how much money it cost me!.<br>
        In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for<br>
REPORT #1. By January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.<br>
When you read the GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU<br>
MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF<br>
YOU<br>
DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"  <br>
        My first step in making $200,000 in 6 months was done.  <br>
By January 30th, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go<br>
back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR<br>
REPORT<br>
#2 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU<br>
DO.<br>
ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE<br>
YOUR<br>
GOAL."  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, more than I needed.  So<br>
I sat back and relaxed.  By March 19th, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I<br>
received $58,000 with more coming in every day.<br>
        I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.<br>
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR<br>
LIFE FOREVER! Remember,  it won't work  if you don't try it.  This<br>
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the<br>
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place.  It<br>
doesn't work, you'll lose out on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2<br>
explains this.  Always follow the guarantee, 20 orders minimum for<br>
REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for REPORT #2 and you will make<br>
$200,000 or more in 6 months.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!<br>
<p>
        If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry.<br>
It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If<br>
you do choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on<br>
your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and<br>
you are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own<br>
business, consider this a sign.  I DID!<br>
<p>
                                        Sincerely,<br>
                                        Christopher Erickson<br>
<p>
PS.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like <br>
        piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!<br>
<p>
"THREW IT AWAY"<br>
        "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away,<br>
but later wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I<br>
had no idea who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was<br>
e-mailed another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it<br>
came.  I DIDN'T throw this one away.  I made $41,000 on the first<br>
try."<br>

"NO FREE LUNCH"<br>
        "My late father always told me, "Remember, Alan, there is no<br>
free lunch in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."<br>
Through trial and error and a somewhat slow, frustrating start, I<br>
finally figured it out. The program works very well, I just had to<br>
find the right target group of people to e-mail it to.  So far this<br>
year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.  I know my dad<br>
would have been very proud of me."<br>

<p>
A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM<br>
<p>
By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the<br>
enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a<br>
program,  and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an<br>
amateur.<br>
<p>
Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business<br>
for ten years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was<br>
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it<br>
wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out.  It wasn't me; it was the<br>
economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that<br>
had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened<br>
to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand<br>
experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever<br>
before.<br>
<p>
The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing<br>
invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who<br>
never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks<br>
of the poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR<br>
GET POORER."  The traditional methods of making money will never allow<br>
you to "move up" or "get rich"; inflation will see to that. You have<br>
just received information that can give you financial freedom for the<br>
rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."<br>
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever<br>
imagined. <br>
<p>
I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor<br>
anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have<br>
already made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the<br>
program after sending out over 16,000 programs.  Now I have several<br>
offices which market this and several other programs here in the US<br>
and overseas.  By the Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a<br>
partnership with AMERICA ONLINE.<br>
<p>
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any<br>
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a<br>
copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One<br>
of the people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name<br>
will be on every one of them!.  Remember though, the more you send<br>
out, the more potential customers you will reach.<br>
<p>
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and<br>
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!<br>
<p>
"THINK ABOUT IT"<br>
<p>
Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did,<br>
take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil<br>
and figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the<br>
worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will<br>
still make a lot of money!  Definitely you will get back what you<br>
invested.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come<br>
in.  IT WORKS!<br>
<p>
                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC<br>
<p>
HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$<br>
<p>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and<br>
we'll assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each.<br>
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a<br>
good list the response would be much better.  Also many people will<br>
send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But<br>
continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With<br>
a .5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. <br>
 Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a<br>
total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order<br>
REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of<br>
200,000.  The .5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.<br>
Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The<br>
.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000<br>
five dollar bills for you. CASH!!!!  Your total income in this example<br>
is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!!<br>
<p>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU<br>
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!<br>
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE<br>
OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me,<br>
many people will do that and more!  By the way, your cost to<br>
participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already<br>
have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  REPORT#3 will show<br>
you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.<br>
<p>
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not<br>
require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best<br>
of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If<br>
you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been<br>
waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your<br>
dream will come true.  This multi-level e-mail order marketing program<br>
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.  E-mail is the sales tool of the<br>
future.  Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of<br>
advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the more people will be doing<br>
business using e-mail.  Get your piece of this action!!<br>
<p>
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is<br>
being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford<br>
Research and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and<br>
65% of all goods and services will be sold throughout Multi-level<br>
Methods by the mid to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar<br>
industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made<br>
their fortune in the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics<br>
show 45 people become millionaires EVERY DAY through Multi-Level<br>
Marketing.<br>
<p>
This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making<br>
opportunity.  Basically, this is what we do:  As with all <br>
multi-level business, we build our business by recruiting new <br>
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the USA allows you<br>
to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product<br>
for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE<br>
MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling.  You do it<br>
privately in your own home, store or office.<br>
<p>
This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:<br>
<p>
Here is how to work the program:<br>
<p>
Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  <br>
  Do this by ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4) <br>
 names listed on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 <br>
  CASH and a SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS <br>
  SIZE #10) to the person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  <br>
  International orders should also include $1 extra instead <br>
  of postage.  It is essential that you specify the NAME and <br>
 NUMBER of the report requested to the person you are <br>
  ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS because <br>
 you will be REPRINTING and RE-SELLING them. DO NOT alter <br>
  the names or sequence beyond doing what the instructions say.       <br>
          NOTE: Write your request on an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper <br>
 and wrap the cash in that BEFORE you put it in the <br>
  envelope. This helps to ensure the mail gets through!<br>
<p>
Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with<br>
           yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.<br>
           Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,<br>
           moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and<br>
           address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list<br>
           and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  <br>
   When doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  <br>
  and addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING <br>
  PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!<br>
<p>
Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it<br>
           as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used <br>
 with whatever e-mail program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 <br>
 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and <br>
 acquiring e-mail lists.<br>
<p>
Step (4)   E-mail a copy of the entire program (all of this is very<br>
           important) to everyone whose address you can get your <br>
 hands on. Start with friends and relatives since you can <br>
 encourage them to take  advantage of this fabulous money-making<br>
           opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, <br>
 more than ever.  Then, e-mail to anyone and everyone!  Use <br>
 your  imagination!  You can get e-mail addresses from <br>
 companies on  the Internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists. <br>
 These are very cheap: 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.<br>
<p>
IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so<br>
always request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase<br>
these lists when you order the four (4) REPORTS.<br>
<p>
ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!<br>
<p>
REQUIRED REPORTS<br>
<p>
***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***<br>
<p>
ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE AND $5 CASH FOR <br>
EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER<br>

CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
        I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this<br>
program. You, too, will be making money within six months, if you<br>
follow the SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.<br>
        To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make<br>
financial decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into<br>
investments, retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of<br>
money hold you back.<br>
        However, very few people reach financial independence <br>
because, when opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is<br>
much easier  to say "NO" than "YES," and this is the question that you<br>
must answer for yourself.   Will YOU ignore this amazing opportunity<br>
or will you take advantage of it? If you do nothing, you have indeed<br>
missed something valuable, and nothing will change.  Please re-read<br>
this material; this is a special opportunity. If you have any<br>
questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this<br>
information.  You will get a prompt and informative reply.        My<br>
method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that<br>
costs me pennies to produce and e-mail.  I should also point out<br>
again, that this program is legal and everyone who participates WILL<br>
make money. This is not a chain letter or pyramid scheme.  At times<br>
you have probably received chain letters, asking you to send money, on<br>
faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  Not<br>
only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the<br>
chain makes them quite unattractive.        You are offering a<br>
legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase the product<br>
from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free<br>
enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is<br>
a series of four (4) FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information<br>
contained in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your<br>
participation in this program more rewarding, but will be useful to<br>
you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead. You<br>
are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which will<br>
be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The<br>
concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be<br>
reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy.<br>
Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!<br>
<p>
"IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"<br>
<p>
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my<br>
mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I<br>
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no<br>
way that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.<br>
BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box<br>
crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten<br>
years of my life before."<br>

<p>
TIPS FOR SUCCESS<br>
<p>
Send for your four (4) REPORTS immediately so you will have them when<br>
the orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST<br>
send out the product/service to comply with U.S. Postal and Lottery<br>
laws.  Title 18 Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A<br>
PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."<br>
<p>
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:<br>
<p>
1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you <br>
  desire.<br>
<p>
2.      Get a post office box (preferred).<br>
<p>
3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must <br>
 remember,  your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the <br>
 others  all move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the <br>
 list.<br>
<p>
4.      Obtain as many e-mail addresses as possible to send until <br>
 you receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT <br>
 #3.<br>
<p>
5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  <br>
  The more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money<br>
         you will make.<br>
<p>
6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.<br>
<p>
7.      Copy the FOUR (4) REPORTS so you are able to send them out <br>
  as soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE<br>
         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!<br>
<p>
8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.<br>
*******************************************************************<br>
<p>
YOUR GUARANTEE<br>
<p>
The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you<br>
must receive 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't<br>
within two weeks, e-mail out more programs until you do.  Then a<br>
couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for<br>
REPORT #2, if you don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once<br>
you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep<br>
breath) you can sit back and  relax,  because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO MAKE<br>
 AT  LEAST  $50,000. Mathematically  it  is  a  proven guarantee.   Of<br>
 those  who  have participated in the program and reached the above<br>
GUARANTEES, ALL have reached their goal.  Also, remember, every time<br>
your name is moved down the list, you are in front of a different<br>
