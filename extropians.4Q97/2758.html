<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I have thought of a problem with the Black Hole refrigerator idea </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;however. You're going to have to put your heat radiators pretty </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;close to the event horizon because Black Holes are small but they </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;must fill a large part of the shy. When you get that close the huge </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;gravitational field is going to blue shift light, including the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;ubiquitous cosmic microwave background radiation, except that it </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;wouldn't be microwave radiation anymore, it will be infrared or </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;beyond.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Hara Ra &lt;harara@shamanics.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;There's an easy fix to this. Use a telescope. What telescopes do is</i><br>
<i>        &gt;enlarge the amount of sky seen by the telescope's magnifying power.  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Using a very low f ratio means your radiator can see a lot of black </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hole in the sky, at a reasonable distance. Just focus the telescope </i><br>
<i>        &gt;on the black hole and put the radiator on the focal point.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
That won't work. A lens (or curved mirror) can only bring light to a focus if <br>
the wave front is parallel or nearly so, and that can only happen if the lens <br>
is small and far from the light source. The wave front of the blackbody <br>
radiation near a heat radiator would be almost spherical and so will not <br>
focus for the same reason a lage magnifying glass placed right next to a<br>
light bulb will not focus. To work you'd have to place your telescope at a <br>
large distance from the radiator where the wave front has become almost <br>
parallel, and then only a very small percentage of the heat radiation would <br>
intersect with the lens.<br>
<p>
Another way to see this is that If it were not true you could make a <br>
perpetual motion machine, just focus the waste heat from a steam engine <br>
and run another steam engine with it, then do the same thing with that steam <br>
engine.                                             <br>
