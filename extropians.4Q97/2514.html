Well, my ego will be doing fine this week ;-)  <br>

<i> &gt;  &gt;WOW. Now *that's* what I call a genuine win-win!       </i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt;My heartiest congratulations to all concerned. Well done, everyone!</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I could not agree more. I think this shows that when two intelligent</i><br>
<i> &gt;logical people have a disagreement it need not end in an exchange of</i><br>
<i> &gt;insults or even worse, physical violence. </i><br>
<p>
We wouldn't dare, the Americans are better armed (or so I hear ;-) <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The only problem is that</i><br>
<i> &gt;everybody is not as intelligent and logical as Max and Arjen.</i><br>
<p>
I always think it's a good thing most people are _very_ different than me ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;You have earned my respect, congratulations to both of you! </i><br>
<p>
Thankyou both for the generous compliments, it means a lot to me.<br>
I would like to point out however that I only deserve a small part of the<br>
credit, everyone who participated in the discussion in a contructive way<br>
and everyone who sent us their ideas helped make this work. It was a truly<br>
global effort.<br>
<p>
I hope this shows that we work out any problem or difference as long as we<br>
keep focussing on 'solutions' and are genuinly willing to reach out to the<br>
other party. Keep our eye on the ball instead of our ego's and all that ;-)<br>
<p>
Gotta run.<br>
greetings,<br>
Arjen<br>
