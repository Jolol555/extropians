<i>&gt;&gt;A person whose first language is japanese apparently has a grat deal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;difficulty thinking about syllables that do not fit into this scheme.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Does this constrain the way the japanese think? If so, how are english</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;speakers constrained? Will we need some other representational method</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to relieve these constraints?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that "constraint of thought" is the problem so much<br>
as constrained communication ability.  It is simply more difficult<br>
for a person raised on Japanese sounds to distinguish others, as it<br>
is very difficult for Amercian to distinguish the many vowel sounds<br>
of some European and Asian languages.  That constrains cooperation,<br>
but I don't think much else.  My Japanese co-worker calls me Mr.<br>
"kuraku", but once I understood that we cooperated just fine.<br>
<p>
I am more likely to believe that /grammar/ plays a much more important<br>
role in constraining thought itself, because complex relationships<br>
are part of the nature of thought.  One can diagnose certain mental<br>
problems, for example, by examining the grammar of the patient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Complete sentences in English have a subject, a verb, and (generally)</i><br>
<i>&gt; a predicate -- implied if not spoken.  Perhaps a language in which this</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not true would be difficult for us (I, strangely enough, can't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; of one off the top of my head).</i><br>
<p>
Several Asian languages use a "topic-comment" structure rather than<br>
subject-verb.  In Chinese, for example, "Fish: eat" is a perfectly<br>
valid sentence, but must be disambiguated by context (one does not<br>
know whether the fish is the eater or the eaten without more info).<br>
<p>
Lojban allows both forms, and some others such as the prenex.  So<br>
one can say "Fish: eat", or "Joe eats the fish", or "There is a fish,<br>
such that Joe eats it."  The semantics of the first form are just as<br>
ambiguous in Lojban as they are in Chinese, but the grammar is not:<br>
the grammar unambiguously describes where the semantic ambiguity lies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about a language with no representations of past, present, and future?</i><br>
<p>
Don't know of any offhand.  Lojban /does/ allow you to leave out that<br>
info if you want, so you can say "Joe [eat] fish" without committing<br>
yourself to whether this happened in the past, present, future, or<br>
other tenses (where English requires you to pick one).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?</i><br>
<p>
Don't know of any there either.  Even in Lojban, one /must/ decide<br>
ahead of time whether you're asking a question or making an assertion<br>
or issuing a command.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That said, I think that English speakers are among the least constrained</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the planet, since we steal words from so many different languages.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We do, however, seem to have problems with melodic and clicking</i><br>
<i>&gt; languages.</i><br>
<p>
And fine vowel distinctions.  That's one reason the French laugh at us:<br>
no Amercian can say "En peu" with anything close to the right vowels.<br>
<p>
And finally, there is the obvious thought-constraint of gender, and<br>
the parts of speech themselves: nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  Classical<br>
Chinese had no gender, but regrettably one of the "modernizations" it<br>
suffered this century was to make it more European by using the male<br>
words as generic pronouns, the female ones as female-specific, and the<br>
neutral ones fell out of use.  I don't know of any other natural language<br>
that is gender-neutral.  Most artificial languages are.<br>
<p>
Lojban is the only one I know of with no distinction between nouns,<br>
verbs, and adjectives.<br>
