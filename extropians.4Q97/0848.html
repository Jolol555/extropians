<p>
Well put.  You didn't mention in your message how you take care of that<br>
side of yourself.  Vigorous exercise, music, taking time to enjoy food<br>
rather than just eating, ...?<br>

<i>&gt;...I play roleplaying games, lecture</i><br>

<p>
IMHO, roleplaying can offer many valuable vicarious experiences (and <br>
social/emotional interactions as well).  You can bet my characters <br>
don't spend all their time nerding!  There are kidnapped heirs to be<br>
saved -- castles to be built -- demons to be slain!  And it has to be<br>
done in cooperation with others, and it has to be _done_, not just<br>
argued about (I've lost characters, and entire parties, to being<br>
ambushed, poisoned, buried, etc., because there was too much squabbling<br>
about the next step to take -- remembering this has stood me in good<br>
stead in real life).<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I'm profoundly happy too....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Now *that* is what I like to hear.  I think there are too many bright<br>
(even brilliant) people out there who are angry, bitter, depressed, etc.<br>
(and who may not realize at a level they can work with that if they<br>
don't like feeling that way, they can change it).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do I really need to "get out more"? Obviously, it is a good idea to</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience new things, to open up new areas of skill and possibility,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I don't see any reason why it is more valuable to move in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical or social world than in the intellectual world.</i><br>
<p>
Not "more" -- just "as".  And I think the emotional world is as valuable<br>
as the other three (I've seen many social people who manage to still<br>
manage to stay aloof from their emotions -- it can be an amusing picture<br>
or a sad one, depending on the person).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Balance</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't mean that one should devote exactly one third of one's time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; each of these worlds, it means that one should find the right ratios</i><br>
<i>&gt; to achieve personal satisfaction and development.</i><br>
<p>
I would add:  and recognize what the ratios are, and not denigrate those <br>
who have chosen different ratios, and acknowledge the value in the<br>
quadrants that one has decided to devote less personal attention to,<br>
and not let any of them get *too* close to zero, lest the (dynamic)<br>
balance be overtipped.<br>
