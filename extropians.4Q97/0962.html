Bad people exist, and some are worse than others.<br>
<p>
1) I don't worry about it -- worrying is bad for my immune system and <br>
   my productivity.<br>
2) I advocate ubiquitous technology -- a Neo-Hitler will have a much<br>
   harder time wiping me out with nanotech if I have it too.<br>
3) I expect both improved psychology (to notice destroyers early)<br>
   and excellent virtual reality (so we can give them something<br>
   to destroy without bothering the rest of us).<br>
4) I try to stay in relatively safe places.<br>
<p>
There's probably more, but it's late.<br>
