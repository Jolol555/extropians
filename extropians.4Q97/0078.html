I hate to say this, but: to whom?  It's acceptable to those who are<br>
holding the property.  So why should we accept the anarchist's<br>
preferences rather than the property holders'?  What makes the poor<br>
person's preferences more important than the rich person's?  This seems<br>
to me to be a breach of universalism, universal brotherhood, equality and<br>
all that - IOW, it's another deep leftist contradiction.<br>
<p>

<p>
Private property in the pure capitalist sense requires no justification<br>
whatsoever.  It is based on a fact: someone *already* controls x,<br>
therefore they should be *left* in control of it.  Finders keepers.  By<br>
this definition, neither first acquisition nor exchange are theft,<br>
because they violate nobody's prior control.  They do preclude other<br>
peoples' possibilities, but that is too vague and subjective to base a<br>
property system on, IMHO (somebody - i.e. logically, ultimately the<br>
State - would have to calculate the relative weights to be assigned to<br>
these 'possibilities').<br>
<p>
What *does* require justification is the *rule* : why *should* we leave<br>
people in control of what they already control?  The answer to that has<br>
two parts: a moral, and an economic.  <br>
<p>
Roughly, the moral justification is sort of Kantian: it is an insult to<br>
human dignity to just snatch something that someone is in control of;<br>
also, moral autonomy requires *some* stuff - a 'clearing', or a 'sphere'<br>
- to be in control of, and*equal* moral autonomy (or equality before the<br>
law?) for all requires that Peter not be taken away from to give to Paul,<br>
for that is treating Peter*differently* from Paul, preferring Paul to<br>
Peter.<br>
<p>
The economic justification is that rewards and penalties for an action<br>
should, as much as possible, be restricted to the actor concerned. This<br>
makes for economic efficiency, learning curve possibilities (a la<br>
Bionomics), etc., etc. <br>
<p>
Now nothing is perfect, and there are bound to be some cases where<br>
sticking to the rule results in 'unfairness' and inefficiency; but as<br>
Hayek showed, as a *general* rule, private property, and the economic<br>
system that goes with it, is the best we have yet discovered for getting<br>
the most out of our abilities and resources.  Is the glass half empty or<br>
half full?   Leftist anarchists say half empty: they do not see what<br>
libertarian anarchists see, which is that 90% of the time, the system<br>
works *extremely* well, and gives more human beings the possibility of<br>
actually progressing in their lives than any other system yet conceived.<br>
<p>
You can't order society by exceptions.<br>

<i>&gt;Mark Grant's retort that the empty office buildings are guarded by</i><br>

<p>
Ooooh, sorr-ree!  Maybe I should just shut my gob? ;-)<br>
