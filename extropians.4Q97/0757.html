<i>&gt;I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory. But as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of two things would need to happen:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it. But as long as there's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people</i><br>
<i>&gt;will always attempt to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world. Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this imposition would go against Libertarian values.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;sounds great, if everyone adheres. But usually the only way to get everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          ^^^^^^^^^^^^</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can anyone talk me out of this?</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: It depends upon who owns the guns. If everyone<br>
  owns the guns, literally, then everyone will be in-<br>
  clinded to respect everybody else's rights. If all <br>
  guns are ceded to one central authority, the chances<br>
  are maximized that you'll end up with fascism, even <br>
  if the pretext of such centralization is to protect<br>
  everybody's liberty. I don't know if I can absolutely<br>
  prove that, but I have faith that it will hold true<br>
  and tends to be supported by the real-world evidence.<br>
  For example, in areas where the right to carry is <br>
  legalized, as I understand, murder and rape drops.<br>
<p>
  Did people in Hong Kong have the right own firearms?<br>
