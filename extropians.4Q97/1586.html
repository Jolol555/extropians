Discuss it with Max.  Discuss it in a reasonable manner.  Do not go into the<br>
discussion with preconceived notions.  Do go into the discussion with<br>
flexibility.<br>
<p>
Why?  Because Max is extremely fair-minded.  He has an innate psychological<br>
quality of honesty and cooperation. He has the keen intellectual ability to<br>
carefully look at a full picture and long range direction.<br>
<p>
He is someone you would want on your team.<br>
