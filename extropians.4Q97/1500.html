<i>&gt; &gt; However, regarding hemp qua fuel: inasmuch as hemp still has to be cultivated,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there's an energy cost associated with that. Assuming hemp is as efficient as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; soybeans at generating oil (that seems like a conservative estimate), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assuming similar cultivation/processing costs (not sure this is true), a first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; approximation of the energy credit (or debt) ought to be easily calculable. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't have the numbers at present. But we don't see a lot of soybean-powered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cars, do we? Now if hemp were incredibly better as a fuel, or incredibly cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to cultivate, this use might still pan out. I'm curious to know if the book you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mention goes into this, or just handwaves about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't have the numbers either, but I know that from all</i><br>
<i>&gt; appearances, hemp is pretty easy and cheap to grow if you don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to hide it from the police.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But fundamentally, hemp -- or soybean -- oil as a substitute for</i><br>
<i>&gt; gasoline, isn't going to happen for a while because they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; solutions to a non-problem.  Solutions that have to compete against</i><br>
<i>&gt; an existing infrastructure which has no apparent need to accommodate</i><br>
<i>&gt; them, and without the ability to provide any apparent advantages.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, it is a given that eventually we will run out of fossil fuels.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When the supply actually runs low enough to drive the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fossil-fuel-derived gasoline high enough, something will be done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Today, though, we are not at that point and we have no reason to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe we're anywhere particularly close to it.</i><br>
<p>
no it is not a given. All of those projections people put out of "30<br>
years" or "50 years" of oil left are projections based on consumption of<br>
reserves retreivable at current market prices. Obviously, as prices<br>
rise, more difficult to retreive reserves become cost effective<br>
resources. Eventually, even oil shales will truly become cost effective<br>
reserves, as they are not now. Oddly enough, as market prices rise, the<br>
number of decades of reserves available INCREASES.<br>
<p>
The only real excuse to not use fossil fuels is because of global<br>
warming, if it really exists. There is still debate on what the actual<br>
effect is, and how much has to do with solar variances rather than<br>
actual human pollution. THere are many indications that our present<br>
pollutive state is protecting us from another ice age the we should be<br>
knee deep in by now.<br>
<p>
A secondary excuse to not use fossil fuels is from a libertarian<br>
standpoint, to liberate oneself from the oil oligarchy. Solar, wind, and<br>
microhydro power are excellent methods to liberate oneself from the<br>
energy sugar daddy. If cold fusion in a bottle were actually to come to<br>
frution, it would be a major destabilizing influence on the oil and<br>
fissile nuke powers that have a big degree of control over our<br>
mercantilist institutions. This is one reason not to buy the<br>
conventional wisdom about cold fusion. The powers that be fear anything<br>
that might loosen their control, and are not totally above tech<br>
supression in areas that fit this bill.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And unless someone in the meantime finds it worthwhile to put a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort into tuning external-combustion engines (what we should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; done in the first place), the "something" that will most likely be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done is finding a way to make gasoline from some other raw material.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps hemp oil or soybean oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
external combustion? you mean a fireplace powered car???? ;)<br>
