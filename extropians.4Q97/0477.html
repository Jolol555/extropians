<i>&gt; I "know perfectly well?" Until your post, I had never heard of "Lord</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kalvan", nor "Otherwhen", nor "All the Myraid Ways."</i><br>
<p>
So you've _never_ heard of parallel worlds?  You haven't seen them on Babylon<br>
5, or Star Trek, or in print?  And (see below) you've also never skimmed<br>
through quantum mechanics?  What are you doing discussing terms like<br>
"objective", then?  No matter how many dictionaries you read, you have to be<br>
able to point to something or it's all just a fog of words built on words.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for, &gt; and even though counterfactual processes are built into the basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;ontological substrate of reality (quantum mechanics; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schrodinger &gt;       &gt;equation and linear evolution).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't heard of this before either. What is it supposed to mean? I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know and considering terminology like "counterfactual processes" seriously</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that anyone else does either. I don't know what your problem is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fella, but you sure have me mixed up with a lot of things that ain't me.</i><br>
<p>
Never challenge a scientist to define his terminology... it's not good for<br>
your sanity!<br>
<p>
Okay, here's what actually happens, physically speaking.  If you fire a photon<br>
at a half-silvered mirror, reality splits into two parallel Universes, one in<br>
which the photon was reflected and one in which it wasn't.  If the alternate<br>
photons hit another mirror, the Universe is split into four lines.  We know<br>
that all four exist, because we can make two of them cancel out and two of<br>
them add up so that the photon winds up in a specific place.  We can set up a<br>
physics experiment such that the photon can go to C via A or B, or to D via A<br>
or B.  In "classical" physics, the photon goes to either A or B, and thence to<br>
C or D.  In quantum physics, the photon goes to both A and B (in alternate,<br>
counterfactual branches), and then goes to C via A, C via B, D via A, and D<br>
via B.  However, D via A and D via B, when added together, sum to zero.  So<br>
the photon goes to C.  If you prevent the photon from going through B, then<br>
the photon ends up going to C via A or D via A, so it has a 50% chance of<br>
ending up at either.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this makes no sense to you.  But that's the way it is.  Ask any<br>
physicist.  Counterfactual processes, or processes in which "it might have<br>
been" exerts an experimentally detectable causal influence on reality, are<br>
part of the current known ontological basis of reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Wrong.  My version was altered from yours almost verbatim, maintained most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the phrasing, and did not alter any meaning except substituting "reality"</i><br>
<i>&gt; for "morality".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "substituting 'reality for morality'? And you see nothing wrong with this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; [rant deleted]</i><br>
<i>&gt; You call this "paraphrasing?" I think I need to call a linguistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; paramedic because you sure have butchered the hell out of my words.</i><br>

For the second time, try to remember what you said!  I'm getting tired of<br>
acting as your long-term memory!  If you can't keep track of your own<br>
thoughts, at least don't accuse me of being at fault!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I am not debating with someone who mysteriously forgets what the term</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"objective morality" means after starting an attack on it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I sure didn't 'forget' and imagine that objective reality (real) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "objective morality"(myth) are the same thing. Somebody did. Guess who.</i><br>
<p>
I take it back.  There's nothing "mysterious" about your forgetting the term<br>
"objective morality".  Nor should you be blamed for forgetting that the<br>
morality/reality analogy axis is used for the detection of logical flaws,<br>
rather than as a proposed identity.  But, I still think you should tone down<br>
the attacks.  And maybe get an email program that will let you view entire<br>
threads as they evolve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;difference between analyzing a definition and pretending not to understand it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Definitions are my forte.  See the book.</i><br>
<p>
My "forte", among other things, is extensional definitions.  That is, for any<br>
given term, I can define it by pointing to something, rather than in terms of<br>
other terms.  I think that our problems in communication derive from a clash<br>
between extensional and intensional definitions of terms such as "morality",<br>
"goal", "desire", and so on.  I'm a cognitive engineer, so I define these<br>
terms as being computational structures, or the human implementation of those<br>
structures.  Example:<br>
<p>
class Goal extends Object {<br>
	<br>
	Goal[]		superGoals;<br>
	double		probability;<br>
	double		initialValue;<br>
<p>
	double value () {<br>
		double value = initialValue;<br>
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; superGoals.length; i++)<br>
			value += superGoals[i].value() * superGoals[i].probability;<br>
		return value;<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
<p>
My question about the existence of "objective morality" can be phrased as<br>
follows:  Given the above definition of "Goal", does there exist a system,<br>
such that all initialValues are zero, and all probabilities are 1, in which a<br>
Goal object exists such that value() returns a nonzero method?<br>
<p>
This may seem impossible, but it also seems impossible that such a system<br>
should return a nonzero value() with no initialValues, regardless of<br>
probability.  Since there are, in fact, logical ab-initio Goal-sequences with<br>
probabilistic arguments and nonzero values, deriving from the system's ability<br>
to reason reflexively, the issue is in doubt.  Since "reality" is as much a<br>
derived quantity as "value", the issue is even more in doubt.<br>
<p>
Or to put it another way:<br>
<p>
class RealThing extends Object {<br>
<p>
	Cause[] mCauses;<br>
	<br>
	Boolean isTrue () {<br>
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; mCauses.length; i++)<br>
			if (!mCauses[i].isTrue())<br>
				return false;<br>
		return true;<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
<p>
class Cause extends RealThing {<br>
	// Here's the paradox; causes are themselves RealThings.<br>
}<br>
<p>
How can anything be true without assuming a First Cause?<br>
(An assumption is a RealThing with no causes.)<br>
<p>
Note the similarity to the Goal problem.  Insofar as something does exist, I<br>
conjecture that the Goal problem has a solution as well.<br>
<p>
----<br>
<p>
You might be saying something about morality and reality, even an important<br>
something, but I can't connect it with my mental model of goal and subgoal, or<br>
my model of cause and effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So you don't want to debate with</i><br>
<i>&gt; me anymore. That's great, but considering your "paraphrasing" and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; random attributing to my position, I don't see that you have EVER debated</i><br>
<i>&gt; with me.</i><br>
<p>
I was using the logical technique known as "reduction ad absurdum", which is<br>
often quite effective against "definitional" attacks.  If a given line of<br>
logic results in a falsehood when applied to a set of known facts, the same<br>
logic cannot be used to disprove a set of hypothesized facts.  Since your<br>
attacks on "objective morality" work just as well when applied to "objective<br>
reality", it follows that a flaw exists in your logic.<br>
<p>
My "attributions" are either verbatim quotes you forgot about, or are<br>
carefully designated as belonging to an "Alternate Delmar".  The Alternate<br>
Delmar is a logical construct used for purposes of reductio ad absurdum.  I<br>
doubt that any readers, other than yourself, managed to confuse Delmar and his clone.<br>
