It's funny you should mention that, the modern theory of wormholes was <br>
largely developed by Kip Thorne, but he probably wouldn't have come up with <br>
it if it wasn't for Carl Sagan and his novel "contact". Sagan needed a way to get his characters to<br>
the stars quickly, and so in an early version of his book they fell into a <br>
wormhole made by a Black Hole. Sagan didn't mind proposing new physics for a <br>
novel but he didn't want to use things we already know are untrue, he wasn't <br>
an expert on General Relativity so he sent his manuscript to somebody who was, <br>
his good friend Kip Thorn. Thorne said he was sorry but it just wouldn't work, <br>
such a wormhole would be as unstable as a pencil balanced on its point, <br>
the very act of entering one would cause it to collapse. <br>
  <br>
Thorn felt badly, he didn't want to leave his friend in the lurch and became <br>
determined to find a way Sagan could finish his book. After a few days of <br>
work he found that wormholes could be stabilized and made to do useful things <br>
if you had something that pushed the wormholes walls apart gravitationally, <br>
something with a negative energy density from light's frame of reference,<br>
something like antimass. Thorn called this stuff "Exotic Material". Nothing <br>
like Exotic Material has ever been observed and there is no theoretical <br>
reason to think it exists, but there is no theoretical reason to think it <br>
doesn't either, and that was just what Sagan needed for his novel.<br>
