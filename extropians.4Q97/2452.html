Chemical life extension thusfar has show much promise though<br>
it suffers from many pitfalls.  The promise is that animal and<br>
human studies seem to prove that certain diet regimens (CRAN)<br>
and supplementation increase lifespan (vitamin C).  Also, as the<br>
chemistry of aging and dying are better understood, means of<br>
avoiding them are becoming better.<br>
<p>
There are several pitfalls, however.  These can be divided into<br>
two major areas.  The first is understanding the mechanisms of<br>
life extending chemicals.  Right now, there are several causal<br>
models of aging.  These models are not necessarily alternative<br>
models.  They do not always contradict one another.  Thus,<br>
aging does seem to occur from the accumulation of damage<br>
from free radicals and glycolisation (actually, two models) AND<br>
ALSO from hormonal changes, etc.  Sometimes a link between<br>
a chemical - e.g., Vitamin E -- and a model -- here, free radical<br>
damage -- is made.  In this example, Vitamin E is a powerful<br>
antioxidant which prevents free radical damage among other<br>
things.  Even so, for the most part, there is no general system<br>
or systematic way of studying these processes.  Of course, this<br>
is a bit of an overgeneralization and the human body is an<br>
extremely complex system.<br>
<p>
One would hope for models of aging processes to be developed <br>
then for means of chemical interruption and reversal of these <br>
same processes to be invented.  This more proactive approach<br>
would most likely spawn the creation of better antiaging<br>
therapies.<br>
<p>
The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery<br>
systems are not very advanced.  Of course, the body can take<br>
care of itself mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often<br>
does work at extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in<br>
your car gets old, you don't merely add fresh oil or oil additives,<br>
you change the filter.  Following the analogy further, when you<br>
can't replace a car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical<br>
life extension is more like filling up with detergent gasoline<br>
then doing auto repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives,<br>
this will be much easier...  but in the interim, we need better life<br>
extension methods.  Many people will not make it to the promised<br>
land of nanotech.<br>
