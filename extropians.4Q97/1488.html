Hmmm...<br>
<p>
      I wasn't going to comment on this one, not least because I cannot <br>
      understand what Ian's purpose is in these statements of his.  Nor am <br>
      I entirely clear whether or not he's asserting the 'shootdown' was <br>
      deliberate or not.<br>
<p>
      Still, I do recall the incident of the 16" gun turret that blew up <br>
      on one of the big battle-wagons, and the subsequent rather <br>
      discreditable furore.  No-one knows how to make the 16" barrels <br>
      anymore, it seems.<br>
<p>
      I also rather admire the US Navy (modelled after the Royal Navy).  <br>

      Military outfits are -- for better and for worse -- staffed by <br>
      fallible humans like ourselves, just as every other organization in <br>
      the world is.  Surprise!<br>
<p>
      Conspiracy theorists -- and coincidence theorists -- likewise. These <br>
      folk are to be found as freelancers, and (in far greater numbers) in <br>
      the counterintelligence and counter-espionage community teams.<br>
<p>
      OK: Here are some 'takes' on some controversies:<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[ TWA 800 ]  To the best of my understanding, the FBI has actively <br>
 investigated the 'missile shootdown' hypothesis, even going so far as <br>
 obtaining armed missiles of the appropriate type, and firing them at 747 <br>
 panels, to compare the damage 'signatures.'  So clearly it was OK for <br>
 them to test the hypothesis.  <br>
<p>
 So why shouldn't Ian Goddard discuss the hypothesis openly?<br>

[ 6 Million Revisionism]  Heinrich Mueller created the Gestapo, modelling <br>
it on Stalin's NKVD, which he much admired as a force for social control.<br>
<p>
       Mueller participated in the Wannsee Conference with Heydrich and <br>
 Eichmann. After the Brits assassinated Heydrich at lidice, Mueller (who <br>
 had Hoover-like blackmail deadlocks on the Nazi hierarchy) moved up to <br>
 the top job (Obergruppenfuhrer) under Himmler.<br>
<p>
       Mueller was recruited by General Viktor Abakumov of Soviet Military <br>
 Counter-Intelligence in 1943, and vastly accelerated the slave-labour <br>
 camp killings, so as to damage the Nazi war machine by depriving it of <br>
 the camps' production of war materiel.<br>
<p>
       Also, Mueller 'cleansed' 'pre-occupation' Germany of exactly the <br>
 same kinds of malcontents who Stalin was busily killing off in the USSR <br>
 -- the so-called 'ally' of Britain and the US at that time (an alliance <br>
 which got us nowhere, since the war was won as of Summer, 1942 after the <br>
 Nazi codes were cracked.  The rest was endgame -- we often knew what the <br>
 German military would do before they did.  (This was quite aside from <br>
 Maxwell Knight -- 'C' -- recruiting every black and white magician he <br>
 could find into MI6...).<br>
<p>
       Mueller fled to East Germany after the war, and ended up in Moscow. <br>
 The American War Crimes teams demanded his extradition, which was duly <br>
 refused.<br>
<p>
      This, of course, _revolutionizes_ the history of the Holocaust, and <br>
  of WWII.  Yet I've discussed it extensively with the Board of Deputies <br>
  of British Jews, and with the Wiener Library, which helpfully sent <br>
  documentation; and with William Hood, for twenty years James Jesus <br>
  Angleton's Deputy at CIA Counterintelligence, from whom I lkearned of <br>
  Mueller.  I didn't want to give unnecessary offence to relatives and <br>
  survivors.<br>

[ KE 007 ]  The Soviet shootdown of 1 September 1983 of KE007 as it was <br>
  _leaving_ Soviet airspace was greeted by many people I knew (including <br>
  yours truly -- and, yes, I'm rather ashamed of that, in retrospect) with <br>
  _exhilaration_ -- wars are mostly competitions in incompetence, and the <br>
  Soviets blew it on a grand scale.  <br>
<p>
  Larry McDonald's shade (he was John Birch Society Chairman, and on board <br>
  at the time) would have been glad to hear a top Soviet General say that <br>
  this incident _crippled_ the Soviet military for the rest of the Cold <br>
  War.  He was a great 'coincidence theorist.'<br>
<p>
<p>
  In 1984, I wrote these words for Lawrence P. McDonald, In Memoriam:<br>
<p>
  "So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse.  But glad <br>
  would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in <br>
  the North-kingdom when the Dunedain were young, and chief among their <br>
  foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorceror king.  No other <br>
  blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that <br>
  foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell <br>
  that knit his unseen sinews to his will."  -- J.R.R. Tolkien, 'The Lord <br>
  of the Rings' Book III, 'the Return of the King.'<br>
<p>
<p>
  The Soviet pilot who fired the missile that downed KE007 lives on a <br>
  Russian Air Force Base in isolation, shunned by his colleagues.  He <br>
  expected to be a hero -- his only comment now:<br>
<p>
       "I was the arrow, not the archer."<br>
<p>
<p>
  I was going to write a detailed rebuttal of David Ramsay Steele's and <br>
  Justin Raimondo's suggestions that the National Security Agency had <br>
  diverted the plane into Soviet airspace so as to 'light up' the Soviet <br>
  defense radars.  But NSA could have used a pilotless drone to do that, <br>
  so it seemed quite pointless.  And SR-71 Blackbirds made over 900 <br>
  flights into Soviet airspace without a single loss.<br>
<p>
  If KE007 had an IFF transponder, it would have returned a civil aircraft <br>
  identifier code when illuminated by attack radars.  Justin Raimondo <br>
  hinted that the Soviets thought the plane was an E4B Airborne Command <br>
  Post (how would he know?) -- but could even _he_ have believed the US <br>
  would have been so incomprehensible as to send one of these planes on a <br>
  leisurely and pointless cruise straight through Soviet airspace?<br>

[ Andrew Robert Dennett ]  My young friend Andrew Robert Dennett, who I <br>
 loved, and gave a home to in 1969, when he was five years old, and whom I <br>
 used to take to church with his brothers, was found dying hideously, of <br>
 _cyanide poisoning_, fifteen years ago today (November 17, 1982). He left <br>
 a tape recording in which he stated his conviction that his life was <br>
 being deliberately destroyed, and that he was going to be murdered, and <br>
 naming those responsible.<br>
<p>
<p>
 I and three other people heard this tape after Andrew's death.  (Mark <br>
 Brady asked: "How do you like the _tape_?"   three days after Andrew had <br>
 died -- only two days after Brady and his clique had rejected the <br>
 peaceful settlement of our LA/Alternative Bookshop disputes).  Had I <br>
 learned of Andrew's death at that time, it could possibly have broken my <br>
 will to fight.  <br>
<p>
 Or -- alternatively -- it could have led to a horrifying outbreak of <br>
 carnage against Steele, Brady and their idiot associates, carried through <br>
 by the top-flight warfighting covert-action Special Forces of several <br>
 countries.  _Whoever_ was backing them...<br>
<p>
 Let them now read Henry Kuttner's story "Two Handed Engine" aka "The Fury."<br>
<p>
 Andrew's father was in British Signals Intelligence.  Would anyone want <br>
 to be Mark Brady now?   Run a Web search on "November 17"...<br>
<p>
 A Yarhrzeit candle will burn tonight in Andrew's memory.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
 Then, on February 7 1984, Andrew's oldest brother Terry was rammed by an <br>
 identical stolen BMW -- same make, same model, same colour -- after the <br>
 other driver pulled onto his side of the road and drove head-first into <br>
 him at an impact speed of 140 miles per hour, hospitalizing Terry with a <br>
 whiplash neck fracture.  Both cars went up in flames.  The other driver <br>
 was never found (by the police).   Licence plate BS 201...<br>
