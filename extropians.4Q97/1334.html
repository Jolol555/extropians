That's an interesting possibility, but it raises a confusing issue.<br>
<p>
By making the formal system inconsistent, Godel's proof of incompleteness<br>
no longer applies.<br>
<p>
However, for Godel's theorem to even be applicable, we have to be dealing<br>
with a formal system in the first place.  A formal system which can prove<br>
theorems both true and false is inconsistent, but strictly speaking<br>
it can then prove all theorems true.  This is not how your program is<br>
intended to work.<br>
<p>
I think the problem is that my claim yesterday that an AI program running<br>
on a computer was "automatically" a formal system was not quite right.<br>
Or more accurately, we could set up a formal system which characterized<br>
all beliefs of the AI, but ironically it would not be powerful enough for<br>
Godel's system to apply.  Specifically, it would not be a superset of<br>
logic and arithmetic.<br>
<p>
This may seem wrong, because surely our minds are capable of logical and<br>
arithmetic reasoning.  However I believe in practice we are only capable<br>
of an approximation to strict perfection in logic and arithmetic, which<br>
is required by a formal system.  For one thing, we are limited in the size<br>
of the propositions we can consider, understand, and prove.  For another,<br>
we make mistakes.  When we find ourselves in a contradiction, we don't<br>
melt down and find ourselves believing that every proposition is true,<br>
as a formal system would.  Instead we abandon one of our beliefs (or else<br>
segregate the inconsistencies in our minds somehow).<br>
<p>
Now I think Penrose would deny these two points; he would say that even<br>
very large proofs could in principle be verified if we took them step by<br>
step, and secondly he says that even if individuals make mistakes, then<br>
the community of mathematicians notices and corrects them.  So you have<br>
to expand your formal system to include an uploaded community, and now it<br>
is supposed to incorporate strict, perfect adherence to logic.<br>
<p>
You can judge for yourself how persuasive this is.<br>
<p>
