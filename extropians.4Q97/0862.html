Someone said:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Interesting. Would these stars have been found if their spectra didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;also have higher frequency components? </i><br>
<p>
Amara Graps responded:<br>
<i>&gt;"Higher frequency" ? I didn't mention anything about higher frequency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Higher frequency of what?, I should probably ask)</i><br>
<p>
I think he meant that, if a star has a Dyson sphere around it, you<br>
can't see the star in visible light (== higher frequency than<br>
infrared).  In fact, you can't see the star at all.  You can only see<br>
the infrared light that the Dyson sphere emits.<br>

As an aside about the "allowing external posters" thread: I'm not
subscribed to this list, because I can't afford the time to recieve
50 messages a day.  However, I occasionally visit the web site and
respond to posts that way.  If you only allowed posts by approved
members of the list, I wouldn't be able to do that.
<p>
Perhaps there should be a list of "allowed posters", separate from
(and presumably a superset of) the list of recipients.
