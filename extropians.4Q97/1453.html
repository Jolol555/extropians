Obviously I agree that people are not words, but I strongly disagree with <br>
your other statement. A concept is a mental state and I don't have mental <br>
states, I am a mental state, or a collection of them. To distinguish one <br>
state from another adjectives and adverbs (information) are what's important, <br>
objects (matter) are generic and interchangeable, lots of things can make me <br>
happy or be red or small or round or move swiftly or be intelligent or <br>
whatever.  Lots of things can be me too, it's just that right now only one <br>
thing behaves in my way. That need not always be true.    <br>

<p>
<p>
Or it implies that our ideas about the fundamental properties that <br>
distinguish life from non life need to be changed. Concepts (not things) <br>
like intelligence and consciousness are more important than digestion, <br>
at least that's my concept.<br>

                     <br>
<p>
True, and it's almost enough to give circular reasoning a bad name. Actually  <br>
I think all it proves is that definitions are not all that important and  <br>
except when doing mathematics or formal logic we seldom use them or need to.    <br>
                                <br>

<p>
<p>
I agree with you 100% there.<br>
