<p>

We don't need a focused image, just that the rays intersect the event<br>
horizon.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I haven't worked out the calculation but my intuition tells me that you'd do</i><br>

<i>&gt; bigger. It's true that a light beam passing through one focus of an ellipsoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; will pass through the other focus too, but it's not necessarily true that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; light beam that passes near one focus will pass near the other one too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
In order to have a continuous image, you must have continuity of<br>
adjacent rays.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's a little off the subject but this reminds me of something I read a few</i><br>

<i>&gt; traditional rectangular ones. They were not very popular. The trouble was</i><br>
<i>&gt; that skilled professional players were not much better than rank amateurs at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the game. Chaos took over and nobody had any idea where the billiard balls</i><br>
<i>&gt; would end up when a shot was made. Skill plays no part when a elliptical</i><br>
<i>&gt; table is used, it turns the game into one of chance.</i><br>
<p>
I suspect a circular table would be more playable.<br>
<p>
Years ago we tried a superball. (the first superballs were about the<br>
size of pool balls) What a joke...<br>
