<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; How?  Artsem a few chimps using some sperm.  It would seem extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; simple and could be done without leaving much evidence behind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Not that I see anyone really advocating this, but what exactly would this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;procedure accomplish for us? And is it ethical?</i><br>
<p>
It would be a cheap, quick way to show it can be done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;My personal ethics can accomodate an uplift by way of cortical augmentation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or other such biological procedure, but only insofar as it provides</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;empirical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;data for use in similar procedures on humans. It seems unlikely that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;crossbreeding a chimpanzee with a human will give us any information along</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;these lines and I have difficulty viewing this as uplifting a chimp, rather,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it seems more like retarding a human being on purpose, and for no valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reason.</i><br>
<p>
I understand.  It was merely a suggestion.  Recall my initial post.<br>
Some people outside this list agree with you -- viz., that uplifting<br>
is akin to trapping a human mind in a nonhuman (less than<br>
human?) body.  However, would you judge it the same if, say,<br>
we found a genetic sequence which would increase intelligence<br>
in chimps, would it be wrong to insert it in them?  If not, imagine<br>
that this sequence is from a human.  Is it still not wrong to inset<br>
it?  If not, imagine (I know this is getting repetitive:) it is a<br>
substantial amount of human genes and the method of<br>
insertion is artsem.  Is it still not wrong?  At what point did the<br>
experiment become wrong and why?  What standard do we<br>
use to judge?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think any serious proponents of this idea need to answer at least two</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;1. Will crossbreeding chimps and humans help us augment human beings?</i><br>
<p>
I believe my initial post answers this question.  The data from it will<br>
also give us more parameters on just how far intelligence can be<br>
stretched inside the biotic realm.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;2. Is there any other reason to do it?</i><br>
<p>
I believe my initial post answers this one too.  However, I think it<br>
better to try uplifting with other species and not use crossbreeding.<br>
<p>
Later!<br>
