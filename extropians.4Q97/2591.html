I've seen some hand-made Malaysian handguns; pretty ugly copies of<br>
the Colt 1911 and Browning Hi-Power, but workable. I've also seen<br>
photographs of Thompson submachineguns built in the Vietnamese<br>
jungle. Modern weapons are probably even easier, as they're often<br>
designed for manufacture under license in the third world.<br>
<p>
Guns are simple technology; anyone who thinks they can be eliminated <br>
is a fool. If you want one, you can make one or buy one; in fact <br>
buying illegally may well be both cheaper and easier. A few years ago <br>
a British shopkeeper was locked up for shooting a robber with an illegal <br>
.32 handgun, which cost him $60. I checked the ads in a British gun <br>
magazine at the time and couldn't find a single legal handgun at <br>
that price.<br>
