Why should we accept the property holders' preferences?  If other<br>

<p>
Ah, but what's control?  Control through use, or control through legal<br>
mechanism of the state?  A bank doesn't directly control an empty office<br>
building, nor does someone control vacation houses they're not living<br>
in, except through the ability to drive out any squatters who might have<br>
occupied the unused property.  Usually this is backed up by the state.<br>
<p>
Hmm.  In a world of private law, perhaps some PPLs would recognize<br>
property by title, and others property by use.  I discover someone's<br>
been living on the abandoned farmland I just inherited from my uncle and<br>
call my title-PPL to evict them.  Their use-PPL steps in to protect<br>
them:  after all, they've been using it for the past 5 years, the land<br>
hadn't been used for the previous decade, who do I think I am to throw<br>
them out of their home?  Private war ensues, unless a buyout occurs, but<br>
that could go both ways: they pay me rather than defend themselves (fair<br>
enough for me), or I pay them to leave the land to save the cost of<br>
evicting them by force (fair enough for them).<br>
<p>
I've just discovered, BTW, (and BTW what does IOW mean?) that the<br>
anarchists seem to have distinguished between 'private' and 'personal'<br>
property.  I'm guess the former refers to factories and the latter to<br>
your toothbrush, but I'm not sure yet.<br>
<p>
} What *does* require justification is the *rule* : why *should* we leave<br>

Ding ding[1]!  That's the point of my devil's advocacy: what if there's a<br>
better system we haven't discovered?  Or more usefully, that has been<br>
discovered but not understood or publicized?  Yes, perfect competition<br>
is maximally efficient, but ignoring the question of whether that's all<br>
we care about (or the corollary that long term profits go to zero, which<br>
always reminds me of the starvation state most wild bacteria live in)<br>
the fact is perfect competition doesn't exist.  Our approximation to it<br>
have done an excellent job of approaching the ideal result, but perhaps<br>
some other (and non-statist) system could provide a better approximation.<br>

Careful; they call themselves libertarians too.  And have prior use of<br>
the term -- both terms -- to boot.  Which by our definition of property<br>
-- prior acquisition -- means that we've been trespassing and should<br>
find terms other than "libertarian" or "anarchist" to describe<br>
ourselves.  Anarcho-capitalist, for example.  <br>

<p>
Than any other system yet widely implemented, yes.  They'd argue the<br>
conceived point, and for that matter implementation: the anarchist<br>
communes (and militias) of the Spanish Revolution.  Between Communists<br>
on one side and Fascists on the other (and overhead) they didn't get to<br>
survive long.<br>

No, just make more effective defenses to the points at hand. :-)<br>

On emulating hormones and long-range neurotrasmitters:<br>
"If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small and <br>
your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the correct <br>
continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work done, then you <br>
don't have a very difficult profession.  I see no reason why simulating that <br>
anachronism would present the slightest difficulty." -- John K. Clark<br>
