<i>&gt; You are incorrect.  I lay down this Continuing Challenge to all who listen: </i><br>
<i>&gt; Before you place a physical constraint on the Powers, you must first place it</i><br>
<i>&gt; on me.  And now, watch as I shoot all your "constraints" down.</i><br>
<p>
In order for this to be an useful challenge, you must shoot them down<br>
using known laws of physics, or at least likely extrapolations (marked<br>
as such) from known physics. Otherwise you can always win by using<br>
(say) unobtainium, angels sent by the Omega Point or the pink unicorn<br>
force. I think exercises like this are useful (yes, I do plan to<br>
continue the nanotech thread from two months back when I get the spare <br>
time), but they have to be stringent. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; E.g.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given Planck space, c, and the maximum density matter can achieve before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; collapsing into a black hole, what is the maximum achievable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computational power per unit volume?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What about negative matter?  You can have an arbitary amount of computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; material in a given volume, with net mass zero.</i><br>
<p>
Negative matter implies negative energy (otherwise it would not work<br>
in circumventing the Bekenstein Bound). So it would be energetically<br>
favorable for vacuum to decay into negative energy states if they<br>
existed; i.e. negative matter would cause vacuum decay. Besides, <br>
outside the special conditions of the Casimir effect, negative<br>
energy densities appear to be ruled out in general relativity by<br>
the strong, medium and weak energy conditions. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given the likely mass, age, and size of the universe, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; constraints listed above, what is the maximum achievable computational</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; power of the universe?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Infinite.  There exist physical processes which are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulable-to-arbitrary-accuracy by Turing machines.  Even if all physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes *are* simulable, they still use real numbers.</i><br>
<p>
Could you name these processes? There has been some rather fierce <br>
arguments about the "real number assertion" on this list in the past. <br>
Basically, if you accept quantum mechanics it seems that you cannot <br>
use arbitrary-precision numbers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given c, the age, size, and rate of expansion of the universe, how long</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would it take an earth-spawned power to infest the galaxy?  1/10e6 of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the universe?  1% of the universe?  10% of the universe?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; General relativity makes the speed of light fundamentally arbitrary.  They can</i><br>
<i>&gt; infest the entire Universe in zero time, and finish before they started.</i><br>
<p>
No. The speed of light is locally constant, that is a basic result from<br>
the equations. You are right in that in some spacetimes there are timelike<br>
paths that can get anywhere in space-time in a finite proper time (like the<br>
Gödel universe, which is (I think) densely filled with CTCs), but there<br>
doesn't seem to be any reason why we would be living in one of them. Most<br>
tend to be pretty pathological, and if we are close to a Friedman universe<br>
then we cannot get around it faster than a certain time. <br>
