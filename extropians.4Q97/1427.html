I used to consider different orders of infinities when I was younger.  I<br>
never really got into the Aleph series of infinities.  Most people<br>
thought my ideas were crazy, because infinity was "defined" as the<br>
largest value.  How could some infinities be larger than others.<br>
<p>
Here is what I considered.  Imagine for the sake of example that we are<br>
in an infinite, non-closed universe.  Shooting a laserbeam into space<br>
would go out forever and would be considered to have an infinite length<br>
at the end of an infinite time.<br>
<p>
Now imagine a beam projection that is one inch wide, one inch tall, and<br>
of infinite length.  The volume of such a beam would be 1" x 1" x<br>
infinity".  It has one infinity of cubic inches within its volume.<br>
<p>
Now imagine a beam projection that is two inches wide, one inch tall,<br>
and of infinite length.  The volume of such a beam would be 2" x 1" x<br>
infinity".  It has two infinity of cubic inches within its volume.<br>
<p>
It seems obvious to me from a physical standpoint, that the 2 x infinity<br>
inches volume is twice as large as the 1 x infinity inches volume.  It<br>
would take two of the former added together to equal the latter.  If you<br>
superimposed the 1 x infinity inches volume inside the 2 x infinity<br>
inches volume, you would have 1 x infinity inches volume left over.<br>
<p>
Here is another thought.  The distance from our viewpoint to the<br>
infinite edge of the universe is 1 x infinity.  The distance in the<br>
opposite direction to the infinite edge of the universe is also 1 x<br>
infinity.  Therefore, the widths of the unbounded universe would be 2 x<br>
infinity.  We also can measure it in three dimensions, so the volume of<br>
the unbounded universe would be (2 x infinity) cubed.<br>
<p>
And here is a third thought.  We can conceptualize an infinite length,<br>
but in reality we can only approach it at the speed of light.  Any<br>
infinite length, therefore, might be considered to be a length<br>
approaching infinity at the rate of the speed of light.  Maybe different<br>
infinities can also be measured or contemplated in terms of their rate<br>
of approaching infinity.  The theoretical maximum speed of light would<br>
be the maximum approach toward infinity.  Something going half the speed<br>
of light would be approaching infinity also, but at half the rate.  This<br>
seems to consider time as the forth dimension, and describes a function<br>
chart approaching infinity at a different slope on the graph, or a<br>
different rate.<br>
<p>
I have never met anyone who even considered these ideas.  My friends<br>
always immediately rejected the ideas, claiming that all infinities are<br>
infinite, and are all equal "by definition".  It sounds like other<br>
people on this list are considering different orders of infinity.<br>
