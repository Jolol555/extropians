Hope this subject isn't dragging on too long.  But, I'm game:<br>

Good point, in some situations one could imagine.  But not all.  Most <br>
signals would not even be intended for reception outside a particular <br>
solar system.  Power limited?  Who knows.  Noise may even be quintillions <br>
of simultanious transmissions from the same area, or just those that <br>
happen to be pointed in this direction.<br>

Good point.  But if we are lucky enough to be in the way of such a <br>
signal, it's still likely to look like noise.<br>
Spread spectrum is useful for several reasons besides stealth, including <br>
reducing transmitted power requirements in some situations (PCS phones).  <br>
And the arguments re: data compression also tend to point to an advanced <br>
transmission looking mostly like noise.  Compression saves power.<br>

<p>
Er, I don't buy this.  First: who said "totally indistinguishable from<br>
noise"?  We are far from being able to looking at the radiation from a<br>
single star and exahustively analyzing its signal possibilitys.  We<br>
probably look at 1% of it at best, from a bandwidth standpoint alone.<br>
Also, error correction and/or redundancy could be in a form not <br>
understandable unless you know the demodulation technique and/or codes.<br>

PS: OK, now I'm bored of the subject.  I'll shut up now.<br>
