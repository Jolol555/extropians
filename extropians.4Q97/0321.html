(Hi Libfut.  I'm copying this to the Extropians list where<br>
there have been at least a few related posts recently.<br>
Otherwise I'd snip it.  I hope you don't mind.)<br>

: the possibility of causing massive harm to others, this<br>

: Certainly no libertarian society could *demand* that a<br>

: risk, any more than we can demand that a cruise liner<br>
: be insured against the possibility that a large meteorite<br>
: might splash into the ocean just in the vicinity of the<br>
: ship, causing the ship to be splashed out of the ocean<br>
: and crash into a skyscraper, thus causing the skyscraper<br>
: to fall down, causing the radio tower at its top to fall<br>
: into a swimming pool and electrocute anyone who happens<br>
: to be swimming there at the time.<br>
:<br>

: &gt; This is<br>
: &gt;a govt. project and we are all forced to put up<br>
: &gt;with the dangers--and to carry the costs of any<br>
: &gt;settlements the feds might have to pay to those<br>
: &gt;affected should there be a breach of plutonium that<br>
: &gt;makes private property uninhabitable or clearly<br>
: &gt;leads to illness and death.  Those are the<br>
: &gt;relevant *libertarian* issues.<br>
:<br>
: No, the relevant libertarian issue is that there is<br>
: a concerted campaign by the enemies of the human race<br>
: to retard any hope of human progress.  It is vitally<br>
: important that we get off this planet before something<br>
: happens to it (as these very same villains keep trying<br>
: to convince us is far more likely than it really is),<br>
<p>
This is not a libertarian position as such - this is a<br>
position that some things (a threat to the survival of<br>
humanity) are important enough to override libertarianism,<br>
i.e. to justify spending the taxpayer's money.<br>
<p>
: and these nature-worshippers have taken it upon<br>
: themselves to dowhatever it takes to make sure that<br>
: the `disease' of mankind does not spread.  To this end<br>
: they do not hesitate at spreading the most ridiculous<br>
: lies, such as the bizarre claim that `plutonium is the<br>
: most toxic substance known to man', and that some small<br>
: amount of it `if properly distributed' could wipe out<br>
: the human race.  As the late Petr Beckman pointed out,<br>
: so can a few kilos of pins - if distributed one into<br>
: every person's heart.<br>
:<br>
: The fact that some libertarians, such as Carol, have<br>
: been taken in by this propaganda is a sobering<br>
: reminder that while we may be tempted to laugh at these<br>
: people, they can be very dangerous.  65 years ago they<br>
: gained enough of a following in Germany to take power,<br>
: and dragged the whole world into disaster while they<br>
: pursued their religious fanaticism to such extents as<br>
: drilling a shaft in an attempt to prove that the earth<br>
: is hollow.<br>
:<br>
: It is no coincidence that the German Green<br>
: party is composed largely of former Nazis,<br>
<p>
... interesting ...<br>
<p>
: and those<br>
: who would have been Nazis if they had been born in time.<br>
<p>
not so interesting; in fact, content-free.  How on earth<br>
do you identify "those who would have been Nazis"?  Or even<br>
define the set?  If I were born in a different place and<br>
time, I might be a slave-owner!<br>
<p>
: Nor is it a coincidence that former Hitler-Jugend member<br>
: Sid Spindler represented the Democrats (a radical green<br>
: party) in the Australian Senate.  When Yehudi Menuhin<br>
: can compare the felling of old-growth trees in Tasmania<br>
: to the Holocaust, it becomes clear that the above is not<br>
: some paranoid fantasy.<br>
<p>
Agreed.  One of the tragedies of our time is that Jewish opinion<br>
leaders have learned nothing.  From the particular statement "it's<br>
evil to persecute Jews," you or I might infer the general statement<br>
"it's evil to persecute anybody"; instead, apparently, the proper<br>
general statement is "it's evil to do anything of which Jewish<br>
opinion leaders disapprove."<br>
<p>
: When little kids come home from<br>
: school with artwork that says `the Earth does not exist<br>
: to serve us, we exist to serve the Earth' (I am not<br>
: making this up - I saw this exact slogan on display in<br>
: a restaurant last week, evidently the work of the<br>
: restauranteur's young child), it is time to stop worrying<br>
: about the Christian Coalition and the Promisekeepers,<br>
: and start worrying about the anti-human nature-worshippers.<br>
: Rand warned us about these people 30 years ago; it's time<br>
: we took her warning to heart.<br>
