<i>&gt;  What is interresting and extropian about a boy bragging about his big</i><br>
<i>&gt;  gun?</i><br>
Greg Burch:<br>
<i>&gt;The "interesting" part is the "extropians-mail-list-as-social-gathering"</i><br>

First, I would like to see some hard numbers before I would believe<br>
that gun ownership is any higher among Extropians than among other<br>
members of the population.  Secondly, I would like you to explain<br>
how the celebration of accountrements of destruction, however well<br>
designed, as a social function of a group devoted to human evolution,<br>
intellectual development and life extension.  <br>
<p>
If you detect a strain of anger in this post, it comes from too many <br>
years spent cleaning up the senseless human waste wreaked by weapons. <br>
How anyone can look in the eyes of someone crippled and maimed by one <br>
of these tools and then joyously proclaim ownership of one is simply <br>
beyond my limited intellectual capacity.  <br>
