Well, yes. :) I misspoke.<br>

<p>
It's a good point anyway, even though it isn't true in most places.  Only<br>
a few citizens in the US are armed at anything like the level which would<br>
be required. That's not so much a problem with how few guns the citizens<br>
have, as with how many the government has.  I would like to amend my<br>
earlier statement to point out that I meant 'militarily' to include<br>
*useful* military power.  Strategic nukes don't really count, since they<br>
can't use them against their own citizens.<br>

Well, actually I was referring to government in general...<br>
