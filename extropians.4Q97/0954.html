Hello All,<br>
<p>
As I explained several times, we are working on a Transhuman<br>
foundation in the Netherlands called "Excedo"<br>
<p>
What I'm looking for, to put on the site, is the History of Transhumanism<br>
and Extropy.<br>
<p>
Can someone explain me in 1 word (okay 2 then :-)<br>
what the main difference is between Extropy and Transhumanism ?<br>
I mean, I have to explain it to someone who is not into it.<br>
Like most of our work on the site will be aimed at, we want to<br>
reach/educate people also, who are not familiar with a lot of these<br>
aspects. Besides this we are already invited by some media to explain.<br>
<p>
Also, can I take this text as the starting point of Extropy.<br>
-------------------<br>
Still interested? Okay. In 1988 these two guys named <br>
Max More and Tom Morrow launched a magazine called Extropy.<br>
In it, they explained several ideas they were putting together.<br>
Eventually, they had interested many other people in these extropian <br>
ideas. Most of us think these ideas hang together very naturally; in fact,<br>
many of us can look back over our notes and journals and see that we<br>
were always extropians, but just didn't have a name for it before 1988.<br>
An extropian is anyone who is interested in expressing and advancing <br>
these ideas, so there can't be any hard and fast definition. Nevertheless,<br>
here are some attempts (which flagrantly disregard the principles of<br>
E-Prime). <br>
-------------------<br>
<p>
Who used Transhumanism first ?....and does this has a similar<br>
starting point (see the above text)<br>
<p>
Why was "Extropy" the lucky word ? <br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks again all !!<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
