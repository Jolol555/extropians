According to some of the literature I've read, they often leave their<br>
tanks to raid other tanks, and then return to their original tanks.<br>
I don't think any of the squid have the same capability -- for<br>
comparison.<br>

I knew that's where this was going!:)  Of course, if/when we uplift, we<br>
might be able to overcome the gill problem...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And, given comparable brain power, I would expect octopi </i><br>

<p>
Perhaps...  Let's find out!<br>
