<i>&gt; I've always felt with the Cypherpunks that while they are on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fringe, they are pulling us in the right direction. Sometimes you have </i><br>
<i>&gt; to go to far in one direction to bring the rest with you, even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; halfway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I seem to remember an article in Wired Mag about the Extropians, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the disdainful letters in the letters column the next month. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; general feeling was "It's a shame the extropians couldnt use their</i><br>
<i>&gt; powers for good and not spend their time with their heads in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; clouds." and painted Max and crew as juvenile daydreamers, not unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; your juvenile paranoids in the Cypherpunks.</i><br>
<p>
I certainly agree that extremists--i.e., those on the bleeding<br>
edge of progress in any field--are a valuable resource, often<br>
unjustly ridiculed for no reason other than being extreme.  I'm<br>
an extremist myself on many scales (anarchy, for instance).<br>
<p>
Perhaps Brin's and my discomfort with cypherpunks is only that,<br>
but I think it is more: as I said, in my experience, those who<br>
attach great value to preventing the spread of information about<br>
themselves I find strange.  It is not a reasoned judgment, only<br>
an emotional reaction, but it is a prejudice that serves me.<br>
<p>
I suppose I should also note that this group in particular is<br>
very good at finding exceptions to my generalizations.  For<br>
example, on the net in general, I find that a silly "handle" is<br>
usually a quick way to sort out those who probably don't have<br>
to be taken seriously.  Indeed, I dicovered Extropy institute<br>
before I started subscribing to the list, but dismissed it at<br>
first because I had a hard time taking seriously anything<br>
founded by guys using the names "Max More" and "Tom Morrow" (or<br>
wherever he puts the zeros).  I've since discovered that those<br>
handles have serious minds behind them, as do "The Low Golden<br>
Willow", "Hara Ra", and others.  Outside this list, I continue<br>
to save time by not reading anything with an name like that<br>
attached to it, unless it is specifically referred to me, but<br>
here on this list I can't use that filter.<br>
<p>
So I'm sure the cypherpunks in this group don't fit the mold<br>
of those I've met elsewhere, either.<br>
