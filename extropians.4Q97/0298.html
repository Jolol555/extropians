Language is not thought; language communicates thought between parties who<br>
share linguistic conventions.  Certain conventions, including pronouns and<br>
syntactic gender, do not create sexism but _may_ reflect sexist<br>
assumptions.  Syntactic gender doesn't really have much to do with<br>
biological sex, as neuter German words like "Maedchen" and "Kind" (girl,<br>
child) demonstrate; syntactic gender is a classification technique.  Other<br>
languages in the world have genders based on animate versus inanimate;<br>
physical descriptions like round, open, long, etc.; or no genders/word<br>
classes at all.  In these other systems of syntactic gender, there is just<br>
as much arbitrariness of gender assignment.  In various Iroquois languages<br>
(Algonquin IRRC), some plants are animate, others classed as inanimate.<br>
<p>
Back to sexism, Finnish and Hungarian, Ural-Altaic languages which do not<br>
have syntactic gender (they have one set of pronouns for all people<br>
--"s/he"), still make distinctions which reflect sexism.  Words for<br>
professions, such as "teacher," are assumed to be masculine; a female<br>
teacher is called a "teacher-woman," with the word for woman tacked on to<br>
the word for teacher.<br>
<p>
How will this relate to AIs?  I suspect some cultures and subcultures will<br>
call them "he," others "she," others "it;" Finns will have to choose<br>
whether to use their non-human set of pronouns or, as they do with house<br>
pets, make them honorary humans; some cultures will just not have any<br>
confusing language issues regarding AIs.<br>
