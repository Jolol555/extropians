<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; In addition to self protection, another benefit is the recreational.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have found that people who initially purchase one gun for self</i><br>
<i>&gt; protection, practice with it a few times, quickly become hooked on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the enjoyment of the sporting aspects, and frequently expand their</i><br>
<i>&gt; collection beyond that that might be reasonably needed for self</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense, unless they planned on a David Koresh-like showdown with</i><br>
<i>&gt; federales.</i><br>
<p>
That David Koresh and company were under-armed for such an event is <br>
demonstrated fact.<br>
<p>
That they were in fact under-armed as compared to a comparably sized <br>
group of Texans selected at random, is an equally well established -- <br>
but less well reported -- fact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That 60 million Americans own 200 million guns means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; those people own an average of 3.333 guns per capita. Self defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; experts will tell you that there really is no reason to carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything more than one main gun and a small backup, at most. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaves  1.333 guns in the average American gun owners posession</i><br>
<i>&gt; which really has no defensive purpose.</i><br>
<p>
This assumes that any given firearm will either <br>
*always* be among the first two choices as a defense weapon, or <br>
*never* be among the first two choices as a defense weapon.<br>
