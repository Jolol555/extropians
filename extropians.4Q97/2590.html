Sounds a bit like Joe Haldeman's novel The Forever War, in which<br>
recruits training on Charon had to avoid hazards related to frozen gases.<br>
Frozen lakes of gas were treacherous because the space suits, even with<br>
insulation, would vaporize a layer of the gas underfoot, which could make<br>
you slip and fall.  If the heat exchanger mounted between the shoulder<br>
blades then came in contact with the frozen gas, it would explosively<br>
vaporize and could kill you.  Trapped on a lake you had to scrabble<br>
along on your stomach, trying to dig your hands and feet in enough to<br>
get traction so you could coast off the frozen region.<br>
