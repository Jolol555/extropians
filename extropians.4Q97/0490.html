} &gt;Crop circles coming from an alien intelligence are obviously trying to tell<br>
} &gt;us something, <br>
<p>
"We hate wheat."<br>
"Build more landing pads!"<br>
"THIS PLANET HAS NO PROPER BATHROOMS."<br>
<p>
Hmm.  Has it occurred to anyone that the aliens don't care about us at<br>
all?  They're just using the wheat as a bulletin board to each other.<br>
Or as a graffiti area.<br>
<p>
} &gt;I posted on this list how someone believes they are parts to<br>
} &gt;some sort of engine.<br>
<p>
If we wave the wheat back and forth very quickly, like cilia, maybe the<br>
Earth can crawl through space!<br>
<p>
Or a senile Monolith is trying to teach us about the wheel.<br>
<p>
} Danny, whether or not aliens built crop circles is about as interesting<br>
} to me as whether the Mayans or the Incas built some particular burial<br>
} mound, unless the fact dictates a particular course of action.<br>
<p>
This is harsh.  That aliens caused crop circles would indeed be<br>
interesting.  It would teach us not only that there were other people,<br>
but that they were deranged people.  This is at least as interesting as<br>
Martian bacteria, the past existence of which also fails to dictate any<br>
particular course of action.<br>
<p>
Although I suppose that our cattle would be the ones really de-ranged by<br>
the loss of their feed.<br>
<p>
Speaking of aliens, Babylon-5 is back!<br>
It's occurred to me that Banks and Vinge are like Star Trek and<br>
Babylon-5, respectively, but with much more SF imagination.  Or that<br>
Banks is a Trek version of Vinge.  Or what Trek should have been.<br>
<p>
Of course, I had to stay up late to watch it.<br>

"I didn't know we could do all this."<br>
"Obviously not.  Good grief, man, the Culture's been a spacefaring<br>
species for eleven thousand years; just because you've mostly settled<br>
down in idealized, tailor-made conditions doesn't mean you've lost the<br>
capacity for rapid adaptation.  Strength in depth; redudancy;<br>
overdesign.  You know the Culture's philosophy." -- _Player of Games_<br>
