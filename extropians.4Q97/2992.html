These discussions over European vs. American violence leave out several key<br>
points-<br>
<p>
One-  Europe at various times this century has been very unsafe-  Shouldn't<br>
world war be included in any serious discussion on violence?  What about<br>
Bosnia?<br>
<p>
Second-  We should define precisely who we are talking about-  If you<br>
factor in race and location, the difference is startling.  White suburban<br>
America has similar violence rates to Europe-  Of course writing about race<br>
is taboo in American society.<br>
<p>
Third-  Due to the first Amendment, Americans enjoy a free press-  Canada<br>
as an example censors many lurid crime details from being reported.  The<br>
American press' sensational tabloid reporting style doesn't do much for the<br>
American image either-<br>
<p>
Fourth-  There is a lack of correct historical perspective-  How many of us<br>
have heard about the "Wild, wild west?  Crime rates in the late 1800s in<br>
the US were low-  Do you really think that a bunch of civil war veterans on<br>
the western frontier would let a gang terrorize their town?<br>
<p>
