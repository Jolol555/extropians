<p>
Small nitpick:_ the glial cells are mixed up with the neurons of the<br>
brain, if you transplant it, you will get the glial cells too. <br>

<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg, I heard you were a neurologist or something like that.</i><br>

<i>&gt; find more information about it.</i><br>
<p>
I have already answered this in a private mail, but I just realized<br>
yet another way to get around the fact that neurons doesn't divide<br>
well; I have a paper called "Neuronal progenitors as tools for cell<br>
replacement in the nervous system", which explains how progenitor<br>
cells, genetically modified fibroblasts and transplants can be used to<br>
replenish the brain. Quite interesting stuff, but still in its<br>
infancy.<br>
