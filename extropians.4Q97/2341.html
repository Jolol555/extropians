This doesn't necessarily seem true to me...  You don't have to compare your<br>
photons against their previous states, but only against the states to which<br>
we had previously agreed.  Suppose I tell you that every second I'm going<br>
to send you a photon, and that if the photon has agreed-upon property X you<br>
should interpret it as 0, and if it has property Y you should interpret it<br>
as a 1.  This agreement would have to happen subluminally, but what if I<br>
then travelled 4E8 meters away and started up the QT machine?  Wouldn't<br>
that be FTL communication?<br>

     -YEAH BABY I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT YOU'D WANT ME TOO-<br>
