Sounds like some work by Karl Sims, while he was at Thinking Machines.<br>
It was pretty general.  A tree structure of segments where parents and<br>
children were connected by joints.  Each segment was a rectangular prism<br>
and contained a neural net and maybe some sensors.  The net's inputs<br>
and outputs connected to neighboring segments' nets, local sensors<br>
and joint "muscles."  He made the physics fairly realistic.<br>
<p>
One cool effect resulted from a bug in the physics where you could gain<br>
momentum by clacking two parts together.  Organisms evolved to exploit<br>
this and that's how he found the bug!<br>
<p>
He evolved things using selection criterea for: getting far<br>
in water, getting far on land, getting high off the ground, and winning a<br>
two-player grapple-the-hocky-puck game.  For each of these a variety of<br>
forms evolved.<br>
