<i>&gt; This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the "singularity".  While a simple interpolation and future</i><br>
<i>&gt; projection of (for example) available computing power may show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; flattening of the curve.</i><br>
<p>
This is true. So far I have never seen any argument for that it would <br>
never flatten that was not based on "but maybe SI will circumvent it" -<br>
invoking the abilities of unknown, unknowable future beings is not<br>
a good way of doing projections (except by me, since I'm guided by<br>
the Omega Point reaching back in time. See what I mean?). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd be very interested in seeing (and would write myself, if time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge allowed) an analysis of what a post-"singularity" plateau</i><br>
<i>&gt; might look like, given the most stringent constraints we know of. </i><br>
<p>
My ever-unfinished paper about jupiter brains contains some of the<br>
potential contraints on very powerful computing systems. It can be<br>
found at <a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/Brains2.ps">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/Brains2.ps</a> in PostScript.<br>

<i>&gt; Chaotic Computability Constraints:  The most ambitious nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenarios posit universal assemblers that can be programmed or designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to build specific structures.  IMHO this is a clearly chaotic system. </i><br>
<p>
Why? The designs of Drexler, Merkle et al look rather rigid and<br>
non-chaotic to me. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.</i><br>
<p>
If Vinge is right, it will not level off until we suddenly run into<br>
the limits set up by physics; had our rate of development been constant,<br>
the curve would be a nice sigmoid and the levelling off would be<br>
a mirror image of the development leading up to it (a few centuries<br>
of fast development, followed by millennia of ever slower development<br>
and then millions of years of ultimate-level stasis). But since the<br>
rate is assumed to increase in a Vingean singularity, the curve would<br>
be asymetric: we get a superexponential suddenly turning horisontal.<br>

-----                    ------<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Just how severe and insurmountable these constraints are.  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt; superstring-engineering allow us to bypass Planck's constant?  Will some</i><br>
<i>&gt; new, higher-level theory of complex systems provide more computationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient means of simulating chaotic systems?  Will quantum computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any benefit here?  Can a sufficiently advanced entity construct a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pocket universe where Planck's constant and c are different from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; own?  Is there any way to communicate between that universe and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; one?</i><br>
<p>
Sasha has sketched a near infinitely fast computer based on wormholes and<br>
basement universes; Tipler has sketched infinite computations done<br>
in finite time. Given a sufficiently ultra-advanced hypothetical technology <br>
and a lot of handwaving, you can probably circumvent any law of nature.<br>
But we cannot say much about it, since it by definition is outside our<br>
knowledge. <br>
