somebody wrote<br>
: &gt;(For example, cars are polluting the environment but I wouldn't like<br>
: &gt;to do without the freedom my car is delivering ! :-&gt;<br>
: &gt;And IMO there is no good alternative for it (yet). )<br>
<p>
Neuronaut &lt;lessismore@mwinger.batnet.com&gt; explains<br>
: I beg to differ.<br>
<p>
As is your right.<br>
<p>
: The freedom one might experience from owning a car is<br>
: illusory what with the congestion, expense and worry that<br>
: comes with owning such an expensive item.<br>
<p>
Do please be aware that not everyone shares your value judgements.<br>
<p>
: There are viable alternatives: Design a lifestyle that makes<br>
: the auto obsolete. I have not driven or owned a car for<br>
: four years. Today is the 4th anniversary of my carlessness.<br>
: Carlessness is a major extropic factor in my life.<br>
<p>
I've been carless for twice as long, and I confess I can't see any<br>
radical benefits.  (Perhaps driving other people's cars a few times<br>
a year has been enough to keep me hooked on the Detroit Delusion.)<br>
<p>
Admittedly I haven't had to pay for insurance, or to park in San<br>
Francisco.  These were certainly advantages when money was tighter,<br>
but now, I'd like the ability to go to special events in less than<br>
two hours.<br>
