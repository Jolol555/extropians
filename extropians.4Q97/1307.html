<i>&gt; &gt;Other areas take over the use of the cortex; this can be quite large</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;changes if they occur early or during periods of neural</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;plasticity. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1:1- How do I induce plasticity?</i><br>
<p>
Training seems to be the usual way. It is possible that the<br>
cholinergic signals from the basal forebrain are important too, which<br>
means that chemicals influencing the ACh system could be<br>
useful. Normal synaptic plasticity is a hot research area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;1:2- If there was hyperplasticity what would it be like,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;short term memory?</i><br>
<p>
Do you mean a state of very high neural plasticity? In that case you<br>
would likely learn fast but also forget fast, new memories would erase<br>
old memories and stray thoughts would be remembered far too well. Used<br>
in the right way it would be perfect for self programming, "mental<br>
rejuvenation" and perhaps for intense training of new skills.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;1:3:1- How does short term memory work?</i><br>
<p>
Good question. Some of it is likely activity patterns in the cell<br>
assemblies involved in a thought or a concept that remains over time,<br>
and slowly fades. There are also some plastic processes in synapses<br>
which may act here, but honestly we don't know yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Now think about my whole body control area </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; being taken over by my head control area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Imagine the processing power, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a full brain used almost entirely for thinking!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Unfortunately this doesn't work well for simply psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reasons. We are built to have a large sensory throughput, and by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;removing most of the body you lose a lot of the feedback loops, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of which are important for emotions and motivation. My guess is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the way to go is to *extend* the mind and body, not the reverse. More</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cortex to the people! :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:2- This basicly happens to the paralysed, what happens to them?</i><br>
<p>
I have heard some reports that people with certain forms of paralysis<br>
get a state of flat affect. But I have not looked into the area much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:3- If I wore sunglasses, earplugs, and gloves 24 hours a day</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;how would my brain change after...</i><br>
<p>
Change in what way? There are change on many timescales, ranging from<br>
seconds to years. Most likely you would quickly adapt in a few hours,<br>
and then there would be a gradual deterioration as the lack of sensory<br>
input made you more sensitive to "neural noise" and internally<br>
generated sensations. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:4- Why are throughput and feedback loops relevant?</i><br>
<p>
Because we evolved to interact with the world, and to retain an<br>
internal state. If this is prevented, normal activity tends to get<br>
disrupted.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The only emotion I really need is courage to follow my will.</i><br>
<p>
You also need the motivation you call your will. What motivates you?<br>
What is your will? If you lack emotions you also lack will, and your<br>
will depends on other emotions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:5-1 What parts of the brain CAN I retask?</i><br>
<p>
Most of them. I think there are very few parts that cannot adapt or<br>
modify themselves slightly. But very little is known yet (or rather,<br>
it is all neurophysiological data with little order).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:5-3- Can I overwrite some of my childhood?</i><br>
<p>
The brain does not work that way. It is likely that you are<br>
overwriting and strengthening childhood memories all the time<br>
depending on your thoughts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I need a funtional brain map</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to see what tasks are next to eachother;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I've spent several hours looking but failed.</i><br>
<p>
We don't know where and how "Tasks" are stored, although we have<br>
reasonably good maps of some functions (like the visual cortex,<br>
primary motor system, speech etc). Try a good neuroscience textbook<br>
like Kandel, Schwartz et al. Principles of Neuroscience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:6- What is the best machine for mapping brain functions, in terms of...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:6:1- locating general area?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:6:2- locating specific area?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2:6:3- economic conservation?</i><br>
<p>
Specific and general in what sense? A PET or fMRI scan shows what<br>
areas are activated during different tasks, but gives no hint of what<br>
they actually do. Lesion studies help to find out this by disrupring<br>
ordinary function, and sometimes electrical stimulation and/or<br>
recording can give more information. But it is a very complex<br>
undertaking to understand even a small region.<br>
<p>
I strongly suggest that you get some neuroscience textbooks, they have<br>
much of the information you want and can provide an useful stepping<br>
stone.<br>
