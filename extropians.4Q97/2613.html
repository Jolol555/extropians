    Heh, I don't mean unified as in all one culture, all one language, etc.,<br>
etc.  Of course diversity is one of the most valuable things in this world.<br>
I'm saying a unified body that cares for the survival of the human race on a<br>
whole, no matter what language you speak, where you come from, or what<br>
religion you are. Dig?<br>
