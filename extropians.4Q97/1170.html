<p>
Yes and no.  Silicon-germanium technology does fill in the mid-range<br>
semiconductor spectrum between gallium arsenide and silicon.  However,<br>
gallium arsenide still offers advantages in areas such as energy efficiency<br>
and in ultra-high performance.  As for the effect on TriQuint's business<br>
(an impact that will take at least a year to materialize), it will be on<br>
the low-end of their market segment, where they have been competing against<br>
silicon for many years.  They will most likely remain competitive in the<br>
high-end arena, which is where they make most of their money anyway.  Note<br>
that in addition to ASIC and general purpose gallium arsenide fabrication,<br>
a significant part of their business is also in high-performance<br>
communication semiconductor design.  They have significant experience in<br>
developing gigabit datacomm switches (up to 20 Gbits/sec off-the-shelf) for<br>
fiber and high-speed wire applications.<br>
