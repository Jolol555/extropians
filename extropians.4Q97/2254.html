<i>&gt; There are two ways to measure the Earth's temperature; you can either </i><br>
<i>&gt; take a lot of surface measurements, try to correct for errors, then feed </i><br>
<i>&gt; them into a computer model which may or may not reflect reality, or you </i><br>
<i>&gt; can just launch satellites and measure it. The CAG (Computer Aided Guess)</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems do, indeed, say that the temperature has increased and is </i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But what happens when you stop guessing and actually measure it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From <a href="http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd12mar97_1.htm:">http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd12mar97_1.htm:</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Dr. Roy W. Spencer (NASA Marshall Space Flight Center) and Dr. John </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Christy (The University of Alabama in Huntsville) have used the Microwave</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sounding Units (MSUs) flying aboard NOAA's TIROS-N weather satellites to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;construct a continuous record of lower tropospheric (from the surface to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about 4 miles) temperatures since the first MSU was launched in late 1978. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The lower tropospheric temperature trend has been calculated to be -0.04 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;degrees C/decade.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So there you have it; the temperature of the atmosphere is decreasing by</i><br>
<i>&gt; 0.04 degrees per decade. This isn't a guess, it's an actual measurement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and matches measurements taken in situ by balloon. As a programmer and</i><br>
<i>&gt; physicist measurements give me a warm fuzzy feeling that computer-aided</i><br>
<i>&gt; guesses just can't match.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think global warming is as well understood as ozone destruction.<br>
The measurements appear much more ambiguous and the evidence for human<br>
impact is less clear.  But in the interest of fairness here is what the<br>
EPA has to say about these atmospheric measurements, from:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/trends/temperature.html">http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/trends/temperature.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although scientists have incontrovertible evidence that the surfaces</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the land and oceans have been warming, some scientists are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet convinced that the atmosphere is also warming.  but as the figure</i><br>
<i>&gt; shows, the 1979-95 data series may be too short to show the trend.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Part of the reason that satellites do not show a warming trend may be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; coincidence regarding the year that NASA began to collect this data. 1980</i><br>
<i>&gt; was much warmer than the temperature that prevailed during the previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; few decades. Thus, even the surface temperature measurements--which show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; steady warming trend over the last century--do not show much of a warming</i><br>
<i>&gt; trend when one only considers data since 1979. Balloon data, which shows</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same absence of warming over the 1979-95 period shows a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; warming trend from 1958 to 1993. Measurement errors associated with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; new technology, and cyclical variations in temperature due to El Ninos,</i><br>
<i>&gt; may also be responsible for the lack of a warming trend. Nevertheless,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to many scientists, the absence of a warming trend in the satellite data</i><br>
<i>&gt; provides an important caution that there is still much to learn about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the global climate.</i><br>
<p>
[Note - the figure referenced in the first EPA paragraph is not present;<br>
HTML source comments indicate that they plan to incorporate a figure<br>
from the international IPCC study.]<br>
<p>
We know that two decades is not really enough to expect to see a clear<br>
trend, and apparently it happened that the beginning of the interval was<br>
unusually warm, swamping the trend.  Expanding the time frame as shown<br>
by the balloon measurements does appear to confirm the warming trend.<br>
The satellite measurement results should be considered with this<br>
information in mind.<br>
