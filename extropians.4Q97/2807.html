I just sent out an article quoting numbers of murders by handguns<br>
in various countries.  Just after sending it, I realized that it's<br>
meaningless, because there can still be plenty of murders without<br>
handguns.  Perhaps the total murder rate, all weapons accounted<br>
for, is similar in various countries.<br>
<p>
Well, after a bit more web surfing, I came upon a chart showing<br>
murder rate is the US broken down by weapon.  The web page is<br>
<a href="http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp">http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp</a><br>
and the chart shows that between 1971 and 1995, the percentage<br>
of murders that occur with firearms fluctates between about 80%<br>
and 95%.  So, my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate<br>
in the US is between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed<br>
nations, and the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.<br>
<p>
My conclusion: if a society has easy access firearms, they will be<br>
used to cause many more murders than would occur without the easy<br>
access.<br>
<p>
You can try drawing other conclusions, such as "the government will<br>
find it much easier to impose unpopular violations of freedom", and<br>
you may be right.  And that may indeed be a good reason to allow<br>
citizens to be armed.  I DO NOT ARGUE THAT POINT.<br>
<p>
However, if you think that there's no price, in the form of blood on<br>
the streets and in homes, for allowing citizens to be armed, you are<br>
misguided, for the facts are clearly against you.  "The price of<br>
freedom is eternal vigilance."  Perhaps to that we should add, "and<br>
some extra blood in the form of societal violence."<br>
