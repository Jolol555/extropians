Fun that you ask, I regularly ask how we could close an open universe :-)<br>
<p>
I have so far not heard a good suggestion in this area, there are<br>
unfortunately too few experts on global relativity on this list. I<br>
think there is a theorem somewhere, mentioned in Tipler's Physics of<br>
Immortality, that says it is not possible to open a closed universe.<br>
This is a rebuttal to Freeman Dyson's proposal in his paper "Time<br>
Without End" where he wonders if this is possible:<br>
<p>
	I only raise one question which may offer us a thin chance of<br>
	survival. Supposing that we discover the universe to be<br>
	naturally closed and doomed to collapse, is it conceivable<br>
	that by intelligent intervention, converting matter into<br>
	radiation and causing energy to flow purposefully on a cosmic<br>
	scale, we could break open a closed universe and change the<br>
	topology of space-time so that only a part of it would<br>
	collapse and another part of it would expand forever?  I do<br>
	not know the answer to this question. If it turns out that the<br>
	universe is closed, we shall still have about 10^10 years to<br>
	explore the possibility of a technological fix that would<br>
	burst it open.<br>
<p>
I think the basic problem is the topology change; general relativity<br>
doesn't allow the drastic change in topology from S^3 x [0:1] to<br>
R^4. However, all is not lost since there are plenty of people who<br>
study how topology change could occur in quantum gravity. It it can<br>
occur, at least we might be able to make basement universes that are<br>
open or closed depending on our cosmological preferences.<br>
