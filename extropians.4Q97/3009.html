<i>&gt; One of the greatest problems facing Humanity is the spread of infectious</i><br>
<i>&gt; diseases.  This has always been a problem, and it has the potential to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite devastating in the present and future as people pack more tightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; together in cities and as single individuals come into close proximity</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more and more other people every day.</i><br>
<p>
Density isn't the main problem, it is the ease of<br>
transmission. Practically no place on earth is more than around 12<br>
hours of travel from anywhere else given sufficient money, and a<br>
noticeable fraction of the earth's population is travelling at every<br>
moment. This makes spread of disease much quicker.<br>
<p>
Note that density may also be positive, since it means it is easier to<br>
organize defenses against the disease, vaccinations etc. Even keeping<br>
people at home works better in a city than in a rural region. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What if humans developed a procedure which could detect most or all known</i><br>
<i>&gt; infectious diseases in a human that was fairly fast (&lt; 2 hours) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly inexpensive (&lt; US $100)?  Is such a procedure possible?  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be the consequences of its availability?</i><br>
<p>
I think something like this is possible and even likely to be<br>
developed. We are getting better and better at bio-assays, and many<br>
common bacteria can be tested for very quickly (matter of minutes at<br>
least for some kinds).<br>
<p>
Viruses are harder, but the new DNA-chips combined with a miniature<br>
PCR device could do wonders. Add a sample, dissolve it, PCR, divide<br>
into sections with special restriction enzymes, compare to known<br>
diseases (ignore unrelated stuff like human DNA). Hmm, that sounds<br>
feasible within a few years, maybe it is a good idea for somebody to<br>
think through it more carefully, start a company and help humanity<br>
while earning good money on it?<br>
<p>
The above device would today be very expensive, but the combined<br>
version would be so useful that it would likely be a mass-market<br>
object that rapidly fell in price (a big hospital version with<br>
sophisticated analysis, and a bedside device able to identify common<br>
pathogens, possibly able to download "lookout sequence of the week"<br>
from the Internet).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One obvious consequence is that when humans traveled to different</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, Customs, while ensuring the humans are not smuggling anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal into their country, will also make sure they are not smuggling in</i><br>
<i>&gt; any infectious diseases.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is quite likely. And IMHO a good idea too; I don't like<br>
customs by principle, but as a defense aganst pathogens they are a<br>
good idea (I have a half-baked essay about the problems with global<br>
travel and communication, where I argue that some barriers are useful<br>
to keep global diversity high. How to reconcile them with global<br>
freedom is a hard problem).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be screened for disease periodically.</i><br>
<p>
I think most people could be convinced to scan themselves; it is after<br>
all in their own best interest to get treatment quickly too. There<br>
will of course be a group of recalcitrant or anti-hypochondriacs (the<br>
kind of people who never go to the doctor even when they have a quite<br>
obvious illness; this includes many doctors :-), but even an<br>
incomplete screening is a good thing to prevent spread of many diseases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; for achieving this goal?  </i><br>
<p>
I think we should try to find ways of spreading medical know-how to as<br>
many people as possible, in order to help them be in control over<br>
their own bodies and to select suitable treatments. My hope is that we<br>
could gradually move to more decentralized medicine, with easy to use<br>
and safe systems in the home that can deal with simple complaints<br>
(such as the screening device suggested above), local "health shops"<br>
to keep our bodies in trim and larger, more specialized hospitals<br>
dealing with the real problems. <br>
<p>
It is obviously the later that should work on the epidemological side,<br>
by gathering information from the more local levels (I don't think it<br>
would be much of an invasion or privacy if health monitoring data from<br>
your home scanner with your name and number removed was automatically<br>
sent to the central database for statistical processing; just keep<br>
Microsoft out of it :-) and disseminating alerts and suggestions.<br>
