<i>&gt;Structural conservation would be just fine (functional proof is too</i><br>

<i>&gt;Maybe, with the advent of xray microscopy... It would help a lot if there</i><br>
<i>&gt;was an encompassing theory of cryodamage.</i><br>
<p>
That would be very good indeed.  See below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The exciting field of</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryobiology does not seem to draw too many followers/funds, however. </i><br>
<p>
That could change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No-one hinders you from going out, and becoming a cryobiologist. Just</i><br>
<i>&gt;never, ever say 'cryonics' in public. </i><br>
<p>
I don't know if I can.  Maybe I shall, but it might preclude other options in my<br>
life.  Can anyone give an estimate on how many person-hours it would take<br>
to go from intelligent layperson to cryobiologist -- assuming I am the former?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Next, find existing chemicals that meet one or more of the specs.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is that 'testing for specs' that is expensive. There is simply no</i><br>
<i>&gt;certified easy/cheap/fast in-vitry model in existance, besides of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;animal model (dogs/sheep), which is neither.</i><br>
<p>
Then, perhaps, it is time to develop -- even one that only works sometimes.  A<br>
bad model can be improved.  No model is worse, don't you think?  I think there<br>
is enough information to build a rough model that can be improved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; We can also use genetic algorithmns and the like to come up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; molecular design and try to create a compound or set of compounds</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once again, you wouldn't be able to check much with your computer model. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally, I think it to be the most promising approach on the long run</i><br>
<i>&gt;(when we will have progressed to understanding the cell in terms of its</i><br>
<i>&gt;molecular processes). This is strictly for the future, however.</i><br>
<p>
"In fifteen minutes, we'll all be in the future."  Someone once said.  (Was it<br>
Bob Black?:)  Anyway, see above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; from the results.  This is sort of like crossing a butterfly with a bee to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; come up with a graceful stinging bug.  Many of the crossbreeds will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; be unviable monsters, but one might work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; After this, the cryoprotectant can be tested on nerve cells and perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; networks of nerves.  (Has such already been done?  I am talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I once suggested using neural cultures on multi-electrode arrays for such</i><br>
<i>&gt;a model on murg (functional check). I don't know whether anything ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;came out if it. </i><br>
<p>
It's a good idea and I think the Prometheus project is actually doing some-<br>
thing close enough, though we'll have to see.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; examining the connections between cells -- which most assume are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; responsible for how the brain behaves, including the mind -- for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; damage.)  Finally, the cryoprotectant will be tested on whole systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; such as a whole mouse that is alive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think fully reversible cryosuspension is physically possible, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;on systems as small as the mouse. Mouse embryos, yes. Adult mice, no.</i><br>
<p>
Why not?<br>
