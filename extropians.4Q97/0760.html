In a message dated 97-10-24 04:01:01 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Any feasible anti gravity technology would be most useful in aircraft<br>
 and spacecraft. Now, replacing cars with personal antigravity propelled<br>
 aircraft is somehting else entirely. With smart navigation technologies,<br>
 using all of that volume in the air is a much smarter way to go about<br>
 it. Of course, if there is an accident, expect to die, unless airbag<br>
 technology is heavily used, in a manner like the Mars Pathfinder landing<br>
 method. Bounce, bounce, bounce...<br>

Well, if we develop anti-gravity, why not develop some sort of anti-collision<br>
field that would repel you from any object within a certain distance(with the<br>
repelling energy being adjustable in terms of distance and strength), like<br>
magnets, until you land or engage with some other object.  That would be<br>
great and very fun for playing some kind of game in the air, with fast,<br>
cushiony bounces off of the others.  Or maybe just close cruising with the<br>
others, feeling the others' energy fields as you come close, playing, like<br>
tag or love making(thats to say if we could combine our own sensory fields<br>
with that technology, incorporating our nervous systems).<br>
