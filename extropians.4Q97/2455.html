Ah, you got one of those Vietnamese surplus guns. A freind of mine<br>
(those of you in Seattle may know of him as "Scootch") has been bringing<br>
all sorts of goodies in from there for several years now. Ollie North<br>
set him up  with the scheme. He also has for sale several million<br>
various models of M-1A, M-14, M-16, and M-60 carbines and machine guns<br>
that the Vietnamese captured in the fall of Saigon. As you may remember,<br>
we had been shipping tons of weapons over  there during our pullout in<br>
the early 70's, to arm the south vietnamese so they could "fight for<br>
themselves", an outgrowth of the "hearts and minds" part of the Pheonix<br>
program run by the CIA. Of course, most of these weapons were still in<br>
their crates when the NVA rolled into town, and are still in their<br>
crates today as they are being sold all over the world. THey've got Huey<br>
helicopters for sale, Cobra gunships, bombs, missiles etc... It would be<br>
interesting to see what sort of cargo cult springs up over time in<br>
Saigon, excuse me, Ho Chi Minh City.<br>
