Some interesting extrapolation, from another list.<br>
<p>
: Date: Tue, 14 Oct 1997 12:19:50 +0100 (BST)<br>
: From: gov.legis@saipan.com (doug muir)<br>
: Sender: lois-bujold@herald.co.uk<br>
: X-Comment: Lois McMaster Bujold Mailing List<br>
:<br>
: Somebody asked me to go ahead and give the long-term results of total<br>
: conscious control over human fertility, such as LeGuin gives to her Hainish<br>
: in "Four Ways to Forgiveness".<br>
:<br>
: All right... but I'm just going to give the results, not the reasoning<br>
: behind them.  Sorry.  It would be possible to give whys and wherefores in<br>
: layman's language, but it would require at least a couple of thousand words<br>
: of explanation, and I don't think I have the time.<br>
:<br>
: So:<br>
:<br>
: Stipulated first, the Hainish have perfect conscious control over<br>
: conception; neither men nor women will produce or release fertile gametes<br>
: unless they definitely _want_ to.<br>
:<br>
: Stipulated second, the Hainish have had this ability for hundreds of<br>
: thousands, if not millions, of years; LeGuin makes it clear that it was<br>
: gengineered into them Way Back When (and, to her credit, acknowledges that<br>
: it was a massive project, involving major rewiring and taking generations<br>
: to complete... which would be quite correct IMO).  This means that there<br>
: has been enough time for natural selection and evolution to act on them.<br>
:<br>
: Given those stipulations, how will the Hainish have diverged from the human<br>
: norm?<br>
:<br>
: The most immediately obvious difference will be a dramatic drop in sexual<br>
: dimorphism.  Hainish men and women will look much more alike than we do.<br>
: Men will probably be smaller and more gracile, without the heavier bone<br>
: structure of human males.  There will be a general diminishment in<br>
: secondary sexual characteristics.  Hainish women will have small breasts,<br>
: though they may be elongate.  Hainish men will have much smaller testicles,<br>
: and possibly smaller penises as well.<br>
:<br>
: Psychological differences, while less obvious, will be profound.  The<br>
: Hainish will be more naturally monogamous than humans.  The pair-bond will<br>
: be very strong and will either be lifelong (like wild geese) or until the<br>
: children are adults.<br>
:<br>
: Children, by the way, will develop somewhat more slowly.  The parent-child<br>
: bond will be even stronger than in humans.  Almost all Hainish will want to<br>
: have children.  Paradoxically, birth control may be harder for them than<br>
: for us... psychologically harder, not technically.<br>
:<br>
: Hainish sexuality will be very different from ours.  Their libido will be<br>
: much, much lower than the human norm.  They'll have sex perhaps a few dozen<br>
: times in a lifetime, instead of the hundreds or thousands that are typical<br>
: for us.  Most of the time, they just won't be all that interested in the<br>
: subject.<br>
:<br>
: Sex *may* be associated with a period of "heat" or obvious fertility in the<br>
: women, although this is not certain.  But in any event, adultery and<br>
: promiscuity will be very rare, and incest and rape, almost unheard of.<br>
: Jealousy, except perhaps among adolescents, will be much rarer than with<br>
: us, although it will not disappear altogether.<br>
:<br>
: The cultural consequences of these differences I leave as an exercise for<br>
: the student... but think for a moment about being an advertising copywriter<br>
: in such a world, or a novelist, or a songwriter.  Personally, I strongly<br>
: suspect that all the psychological energy that humans give to our sexuality<br>
: would have to go _somewhere_ -- into incredibly intense friendships, or<br>
: religious feeling, or gregariousness, or artistic sensibility, or a<br>
: super-developed code of personal behavior -- but I admit that this part is<br>
: pure speculation.  They might just spend a couple more hours at the office<br>
: every day.<br>
:<br>
: The Hainish will be, in general, somewhat less aggressive than us.  Hormone<br>
: levels will be different; in particular, average male testosterone levels<br>
: in the  will be much lower.  However, they will still be capable of<br>
: testosterone spikes under the right circumstances.  They will be probably<br>
: still be able to compete and fight quite effectively if pressed, but they<br>
: may not have much flair for organized aggression (i.e., war).  It is also<br>
: very possible that they will be less instinctively hierarchical than we<br>
: are.  On the other hand, they might also be even _more_ instinctively<br>
: territorial.  Again, cultural consequences are left as an exercise.<br>
:<br>
: Oh, one last kicker:  the Hainish may be noticeably less altruistic than we<br>
: are.  "Altruism" in the biological sense has a much broader meaning than in<br>
: the colloquial, but suffice it to say that the Hainish may have trouble<br>
: giving loyalty to anything bigger than the immediate family.  This one's<br>
: not certain... but in any event, their social structures will be radically<br>
: different from ours.<br>
:<br>
: I could go on, but you get the idea:  the Hainish would not be human.<br>
: First cousins, yes, but they'd be at least as different from us as lions<br>
: are from tigers, or horses from donkeys.  They'd be a different species,<br>
: and instantly recognizable as such.  LeGuin's depiction of them as human in<br>
: all respects except fertility (albeit humans with an idiosyncratic culture)<br>
: is just not possible.  Changing a single characteristic of a species is<br>
: almost as hard as changing a single law of physics, and this is most<br>
: strongly true when the characteristic is related to reproduction.<br>
:<br>
: Do I hear someone sniffing at "not possible"?  Okay... it's, like,<br>
: *possible*, but so biologically bizarre as to require a serious<br>
: explanation... like a planet with a mixed methane-and-oxygen atmosphere<br>
: would be chemically bizarre, or a a bright purple star would be<br>
: astronomically bizarre.  We'd say "hey..." if we say those things in an SF<br>
: story; this is at the same level of funkiness.<br>
:<br>
: Now, I hate to do this, 'cause normally I just love discussing this sort of<br>
: thing, but I'm having a busyish time in my life (working on a re-election<br>
: campaign), and I don't think I have time to compose an explanatory<br>
: mega-post.  So I'm just going to say that these conclusions are, if not<br>
: absolutely certain, at least solid speculation based on universally<br>
: accepted principles of population biology.<br>
:<br>
: ObBujold, I've seen biology in her books that made me go "hmmmm", but<br>
: nothing that could be called goofy.  She's actually pretty good about that,<br>
: more so than with the physics and such IMO.<br>
:<br>
:<br>
: Cheers,<br>
