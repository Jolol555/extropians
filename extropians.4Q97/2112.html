Don't worry about being seen as "culty", the EI has never given an <br>
exclusive impression.  S/N is an obvious problem for the net in general. <br>
And if we have to pay to be involved in an intellegent discussion now and <br>
then, it's worth it.  It must take some work to keep the EI going.  And <br>
by the way, I'm one of those who haven't bothered to pay up. Just lazy.  <br>
It'll remind me.<br>
