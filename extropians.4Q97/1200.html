Of course, if the discussion of you were public, you *would* have the<br>
opportunity to straighten things out.  The problem arises not so much from the<br>
loss of privacy as from imbalances in privacy - the more public individual is<br>
at a disadvantage when faced with hostile conspiracy.  In this case, the<br>
hostility is unintentional.<br>

I find publicity serves as a substantial disincentive to unethical behavior.<br>
Secrecy lets people get away with things.<br>
