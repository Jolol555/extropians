Trains, as I recall, not planes.  The results were provocative but, as<br>
usual, ambiguous and iffy.  (As I recall, the comparison stats were for the<br>
same trip in the weeks immediately before and after the event, or maybe for<br>
the equivalent trip the year previously.  Weather variations and all manner<br>
of other stochastic wiggles blur such cfs - and presumably the number of<br>
passengers will drop off a bit in the week *after* a fatal crash.  I even<br>
found such an effect in Lotto guesses - after a given number has won, it<br>
becomes slightly more unpopular for the following couple of weeks.  It's<br>
had its turn, after all.  Lightning never strikes...  If the odds were<br>
fairer, this would be a useful item of information for rational people<br>
wishing to place bets with higher-than-strictly-correct returns.)<br>
<p>
These days with computerised booking it would be very easy for airlines to<br>
do such comparisons.  They might even be doing so, but the results would<br>
never be published - PR nightmare!  (Admitting that planes crash, I mean.<br>
Not on *our* airline, sir!)<br>
