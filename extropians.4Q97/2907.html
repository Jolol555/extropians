<i>&gt; From:          Keith Elis &lt;hagbard@ix.netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 &lt;clip&gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Shouldn't the</i><br>
<i>&gt; price of purchasing a firearm mirror the increased risk to self, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; others even if only accidental harms are involved?</i><br>
<p>
The problem with this proposal is that it identifies no source of <br>
funding for the necessary payments.  <br>
<p>
Most people who acquire a firearm and get basic training in its use <br>
and care, slightly DEcrease the risk to themselves, and thus under <br>
this proposal should be paid.<br>
<p>
Some people SUBSTANTIALLY decrease the risk to themselves, and thus <br>
should be paid a lot.<br>
<p>
My counterproposal is that said decrease in risk is payment enough; <br>
but we certainly shouldn't tax guns or otherwise penalize people for <br>
being concerned for their safety.<br>
