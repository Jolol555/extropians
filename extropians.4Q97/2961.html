Brian D Williams thinks censorship is moral, I think it's an obscenity.  <br>
I can't prove It's wrong, I can't prove murder is wrong either and don't feel <br>
I need to, I would put both in the same category. There is no disputing <br>
matters of taste however so I will try to concentrate on practical <br>
considerations. <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I hardly think the constant barrage of illegal gun usage in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;media constitutes an "Idea" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't be ridiculous. You may not like the "guns are sexy and fun" meme and  <br>
I'm not too crazy about it myself, but it certainly changes peoples behavior  <br>
and it can be sent over a wire, so of course it's an idea. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and "Idea's" are banned all the time. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sure they could be banned, government thugs pass laws like that all the time, <br>
but making laws is easy, enforcing them is not. <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Let's just incorporate it into the so called "Safe Harbor" ruling         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that confines erotica to hours between 10pm and 6am.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you believe that if your children see a picture of 2 people fucking or  <br>
even seeing the word "fuck" will ruin them for life then it's your <br>
responsibility to stop them from seeing it, not mine. Personally I don't <br>
think the matter is important so I won't lift a finger to help you, but <br>
they're your kids so I won't try to stop you either, however if you use that <br>
tired old excuse to limit my freedom I will fight you with everything I have, <br>
including violence if I think I could get away with it.   <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Now it's not banned, "just confined to reasonable hours."</i><br>
<p>
<p>
By the same token books are never banned, they are only burned because of a <br>
lack of "reasonable readers", the government of course determines who is <br>
reasonable and deserves a readers licenses.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Besides with over 20,000 gun laws in this country, which in my        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;opinion is quite an effective ban, whats wrong with one little law        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;striking at the source.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
For one thing, such a law has nothing to do with guns, it has to do with <br>
speech and the inability of government to convince people to  do what they <br>
want. The only solution these gangsters can think of is to use force to stop <br>
citizens from hearing the other side of the argument.<br>
<p>
For another thing, if we have 20,000 idiotic laws that are largely ignored <br>
then having 20,001 is unlikely to improve the situation.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By the way, it would be trivial for the government to stop this in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the mass media, (TV and Movies).</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
If the thought police in the USA stop people from  printing books or making <br>
movies they will simply do it in a country that has more freedom, and there <br>
would always be such places because of the considerable  financial reward <br>
that would result. Smuggling has always been lucrative, and now with trade <br>
becoming international and several trillion dollars flowing across "sovereign" <br>
borders every day, and doing it in every direction, it has become even more <br>
so.<br>
<p>
The government has shown that it is utterly incapable of stopping even <br>
something as concrete as an object from coming into the country, an object  <br>
like hundreds of tons of cocaine or many thousands of tons of cannabis.  <br>
Encryption is just Mathematics and a cryptograph program like PGP is not an <br>
object, it's a sequence of bits. If you can't even stop objects from entering <br>
the nation how on earth  are you going to stop bits, bits  that can be <br>
duplicated endlessly at virtually no cost,  bits that can be easily and very <br>
effectively hidden with encryption, bits that can make use of the new <br>
communication channels that open up daily to every part of the planet? <br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Some cable companies as well as TV stations already have voluntary         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anti-gun policies.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A cable company with a anti-gun policy? A cable company without CNN, NBC, ABC, <br>
CBS, FOX, HBO? A cable company that volunteers for bankruptcy?  <br>
I think not.<br>
                    <br>
<i>        &gt;What it might do is put an end to "Hollywood Hippocricy" i.e.       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Sylvester Stallones conscientious objector status during the vietnam         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;war only to make million's playing a big gun shooting war hero later.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
The man is not a war hero, the man is an actor and that's a perfectly <br>
honorable profession. He showed intelligence in getting out of the Vietnam <br>
war, more intelligence than most. When it's a question of survival, when a <br>
bunch of goons want your labor and try to enslave you so you can perform a <br>
very dangerous, unpleasant, and pointless job for them 12 thousand miles away, <br>
you do what you have to do to remain free. I wouldn't have held it against him <br>
if he shot off his big toe to prevent it, or bribed someone, or pretended to <br>
be insane, or showed up at the recruiting office in a strapless evening gown.<br>
       <br>
