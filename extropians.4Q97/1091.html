I enjoy taking a contrarian view to the usual Microsoft bashing. In that<br>
contrarian spirit, here's a selection from a book review in the current<br>
Business Week of Apple: The Inside Story of Intrigue, Egomania, and<br>
Business Blunders by Jim Carlton:<br>
<p>
"Is mismanagement at Apple isn't news, some of Carlton's insights about<br>
Microsoft may be. While Gates is considered eveil incarnate in Mac circles,<br>
this book shows him to be far more a patient friend than a vicious foe.<br>
True, Gates has long made a killing by selling Mac programs but he once<br>
tried to steer Apple toward a strategy that would have made the Mac, not<br>
Windows, the software standard in the PC industry. The book not only<br>
includes the full text of a 1985 memo that lays out that plan but also<br>
reveals that Gates actually called executives at Hewlett-Packard Co. and<br>
AT&amp;T to make sure there was real interest from possible cloners before<br>
sending the note.<br>
<p>
"Gates repeatedly leaves the door open to tighter links, despite shoddy<br>
treatment from mistrustful Apple executives. Take Apple's 1995 sneak attack<br>
lawsuit against Microsoft over a tiff that Gates had thought he had<br>
straighted out. Lambasting Spindler for Apple's "lack of candor and<br>
honesty," he nonetheless reaches out a hand to an already-weakening Apple.<br>
"I still feel that a constructive dialog between you and me would be<br>
helpful... I think the Macintosh has a bright future," says Gates. It's a<br>
much kinder and gentler Gates than we usually hear about now."<br>
