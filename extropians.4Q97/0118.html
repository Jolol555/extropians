THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART I<br>
<p>
by Frederick Mann<br>
						10/4/97<br>
<p>
Introduction<br>
------------<br>
<p>
The Economic Means to Freedom is one among many<br>
strategies that any individual could follow to<br>
expand freedom.  Nothing in this article should<br>
be regarded as a suggestion that other freedom<br>
strategies should be changed or abandoned.<br>
<p>
I do, however, encourage those looking for better,<br>
more workable, and more profitable strategies, to<br>
consider the Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
<p>
Three important factors make the Economic Means<br>
to Freedom attractive:<br>
<p>
1. The actions you take are under your control<br>
and the outcome of your actions -- the results<br>
you produce -- for the most part depend on<br>
your own actions.<br>
<p>
2. The results can be quick, so you don't have<br>
to wait for years and years before enjoying the<br>
benefits that result from your actions.<br>
<p>
3. Your actions can become profitable fairly<br>
quickly.  This may enable you to spend more<br>
time on profitable freedom-expanding actions.<br>
It may even enable you to devote all your<br>
working time to promoting freedom in profitable<br>
ways. <br>
<p>
This is the first of a series of articles on the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  Further articles are<br>
in the pipeline.<br>

<p>
Principles of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Probably, about 20 important principles of<br>
the Economic Means to Freedom can be identified.<br>
This article covers a few.  Other principles<br>
will be described in the rest of this series.<br>
<p>
This article is mostly theory.  Future articles<br>
will cover some of the specific steps you may<br>
be able to take to embark upom practicing the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.  This article does<br>
suggest a few steps to start with -- such as<br>
finding out more about the free-enterprise<br>
institutions mentioned below (by utilizing<br>
them you may be able to implement some aspects<br>
of the Economic Means to Freedom), and<br>
subscribing to the Advanced Freedom Solutions<br>

<p>
<p>
The Opportunity Gap<br>
-------------------<br>
<p>
As a professional consultant I've worked with<br>
computers for many years.  I've also done some<br>
thinking about why Microsoft has been so successful.<br>
Why did it overtake IBM in terms of market valuation<br>
some years ago?<br>
<p>
Microsoft basically sells software programs to make<br>
computers more efficient and effective and easier<br>
to use.  We could call Microsoft's programs "computer<br>
success programs."  At the time Microsoft was created<br>
its potential could have been measured by the<br>
difference between how successful computers were<br>
at that time compared to how successful they could<br>
become.  There was a gap between what was and<br>
what could be.  This gap represents potential.<br>
By utilizing this gap of potential, Microsoft<br>
co-founder Bill Gates and some of his associates<br>
became a billionaires and top the list of the<br>
richest people in the world.<br>
<p>
The "gap of potential" can also be called an<br>
"opportunity gap."  In human affairs there is<br>
also a gap between what is and what could be.<br>
We suffer from "human failure programs" or "HFPs"<br>
(like coercive political systems!) that tend to<br>
keep many of us stuck at a low level -- if we allow<br>
them to!  The gap between what is and what could<br>
or should be represents potential -- the opportunity<br>
gap.  In human affairs generally, this potential<br>
is considerably greater than the potential that<br>
enabled Bill Gates to become the richest man in<br>
the world.<br>
<p>
So, the first thing to appreciate is that there is<br>
this huge potential of the opportunity gap.  Provide<br>
people with the means to bridge the opportunity gap,<br>
i.e., shift from where they are to where they should<br>
or could be, is the essence of the Economic Means to<br>
Freedom.<br>
<p>
Of course, with a computer it's easy to delete an<br>
old program and install a new one.  With humans it's<br>
much more difficult.  We tend to love and identify<br>
with our programs (some obsolete), even if they no<br>
longer work very well.<br>
<p>
Notice that it's largely because of the terrocrats<br>
that we have the opportunity to take advantage of<br>
such an enormous opportunity gap.  By "terrocrats"<br>
I mean coercive political agents or terrorist<br>
bureaucrats.  Through coercive control of "education"<br>
and other means, they load people with human failure<br>
programs (HFPs) -- such as "obedience to authority."<br>
In the absence of coercive political systems, there<br>
would be far less holding people down, and the<br>
opportunity gap would be considerably smaller!<br>
<p>
Also notice that as terrocrats become more onerous<br>
and oppressive with their "laws and regulations,"<br>
"taxes," property seizures, etc., the more they<br>
tend to expand the opportunity gap!<br>
<p>
<p>
Example of Economic Means to Freedom<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<p>
As an outstanding example of someone practicing the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom, a businessman bought a subset of the<br>
materials now available on &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;<br>
in 1993.  At the time his company had assets of $286,000.<br>
Now, four years later his company's assets are worth<br>
about $40,000,000!  Through various stages of growth and<br>
metamorphoses and a reverse takeover/merger, this company<br>
is now listed on Nasdaq.  When all the reverse takeover/<br>
merger transactions are completed, I guesstimate about 90%<br>
of the company's shares will be owned by freedom lovers.<br>
(The name of the company is available upon request.  This<br>
is emphatically not advice for or against investing in<br>
this company.)<br>

<p>
<p>
Three Economic Sectors<br>
----------------------<br>
<p>
The second important thing to realize is that we can<br>
usefully distinguish three economic sectors: (1) public;<br>
(2) private; (3) free enterprise.  The "public" sector<br>
is the terrocrat sector.  The "private" sector consists<br>
mostly of people who kowtow to the terrocrats and/or are<br>
in cahoots with them in various ways.  They pay "taxes"<br>
to support the terrocrats, they obey their "regulations,"<br>
and they often beg for special favors like "tariff<br>
protection."  The free-enterprise sector is also called<br>
"the underground economy," "black economy," or "unrecorded<br>
economy."<br>
<p>
By "free enterprise" I mean an economic system characterized<br>
by (1) property ownership; and (2) voluntary exchange.  In<br>
a free-enterprise system there are no "taxes" and no coercive<br>
terrocrat "regulations"; no one initiates force, fraud, or<br>
the threat of force to overwhelm the will of another; people<br>
are free to do whatever they like, provided they don't<br>
violate the rights of others -- basically the right to own<br>
property and to engage in voluntary exchange.  Free enterprise<br>
is a "human success program" or "HSP."  Coercion can be an<br>
HSP for those administering the coercion and some who<br>
benefit from the coercion, but is an HFP or human failure<br>
program for everyone else.<br>
<p>
The greatest potential for providing people with the means<br>
to elevate themselves (in all respects) is in the free-<br>
enterprise sector, because this is where we enjoy the<br>
greatest freedom.  One perspective of freedom is that it<br>
represents the range of positive options available to you.<br>
If you can find ways to operate with reasonable safety<br>
in the free-enterprise sector, you enjoy competitive<br>
advantages: no or few "taxes," no or few "regulations."<br>
(For most people it's not yet feasible to completely<br>
escape from the terrocrat and private sectors -- e.g.,<br>
when I put gas in my car, I pay some taxes.)<br>
<p>
The Internet makes it easier to shift assets, earnings,<br>
and economic activities into the free-enterprise sector.<br>
Of course, the Internet itself constitutes an enormous<br>
expansion of the free-enterprise sector.<br>
<p>
<p>
Free-Enterprise Institutions<br>
----------------------------<br>
<p>
The third principle of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
is the creation of free-enterprise institutions in areas<br>
like secure communication, currencies, banking, barter,<br>
investment, raising capital (free-enterprise share<br>
exchanges), etc.  These institutions will make it easier<br>
to shift assets, earnings, and economic activities into<br>
the free-enterprise sector.  Some examples:<br>
<p>
Anthony L. Hargis &amp; Co., 17220 Newhope St. #201,<br>
Fountain Valley, California [92708]; Tel. (714) 957-1375.<br>
Banking -- gold and dollar accounts; free-enterprise<br>
share exchange.<br>

<p>
I invite veryone interested in furthering the Economic<br>
Means to Freedom  to help create and/or expand these<br>
and similar free-enterprise institutions.<br>
<p>
A major consideration is that if you're stuck in the<br>
"official" systems and they collapse, you may be in<br>
such a hopeless situation that your very physical<br>
survival becomes a problem.  Should such a collapse<br>
occur, you'll be much better off if you've been using<br>
alternative systems for some time, and you've got at<br>
least some of your assets in them.<br>
<p>
<p>
Benefits of the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
If you're an ardent freedom lover, and you live "in<br>
the system," obeying terrocrats and supporting them<br>
by paying "taxes," then you're living contrary to<br>
your philosophy -- some would even say you're being<br>
a traitor to your own philosophy.  I have no intention<br>
here to make anyone wrong.  I admit to paying certain<br>
"taxes" because I calculate that to be the least evil.<br>
In this regard I choose to be a traitor to my own<br>
philosophy.<br>
<p>
We can think of a scale, spectrum, or continuum.  At<br>
one extreme is being totally "in the system"; at the<br>
other extreme is being totally "outside the system."<br>
Each individual can calculate where on the scale he<br>
or she derives maximum benefit.  And, of course, your<br>
life and affairs can be compartmentalized so certain<br>
assets and activities are "in the system,"and others<br>
are "outside the system."<br>
<p>
Practicing the Economic Means to Freedom enables you<br>
to focus on doing things you can control.  In contrast<br>
to political strategies, your results don't depend on<br>
some terrocrats "changing the law" or a few million<br>
voters changing their minds.  I'm not suggesting that<br>
anyone drop political strategies.  I am suggesting that<br>
some people will be more successful, and more satisfied<br>
with the results they produce, and personally benefit<br>
more from those results more quickly, if they practice<br>
the Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
<p>
Provided you can become successful in the free-enterprise<br>
sector, the benefits can be quick and significant.  For<br>
starters, if you successfully exit a "tax system," it may<br>
be the equivalent of giving yourself a 25-35% pay raise!<br>
<p>
By the way, my experience has been that in all the places<br>
I've lived during the past 25 years, I have found people<br>
in the private sector willing to pay someone like myself<br>
in the free-enterprise sector without any problems.  It<br>
may involve registering your own company or setting up<br>
a trust.  I've literally had no problems -- even with a<br>
giant American multinational company -- to set up the<br>
arrangements such that I operate in the free-enterprise<br>
sector.  In fact, it's often beneficial to the company<br>
because it relieves them of obligations like withholding,<br>
a lot of admin, and they can easily get rid of me whenever<br>
they want to.<br>
<p>
I find the sense of living free and prospering exhilerating!<br>
I have a strong "beat-the-system" streak and I certainly<br>
enjoy not having to kowtow to terrocrats -- and for more<br>
than two decades, never having even one penny "deducted"<br>
or "withheld" from my earnings!<br>
<p>
Of course, there are risks involved.  You have to be more<br>
careful what you say and do.  You have to guard your back.<br>
For those who are risk-averse, the Economic Means to Freedom<br>
may be inappropriate.  Possibly, you should follow other<br>
freedom strategies.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, operating "outside the system" tends<br>
to reduce certain risks.  People "in the system" report<br>
all kinds of information about themselves to the terrocrats.<br>
They are also reported on by their "employers," insurance<br>
companies, stock brokers, doctors, etc.  So if you're "in<br>
the system," terrocrats tend to have lots of information<br>
they can use against you.  In contrast, terrocrats often<br>
have very little information concerning people "outside<br>
the system."<br>
<p>
<p>
What to Do Next<br>
---------------<br>
<p>
So, if you want to live in accordance with your philosophy<br>
of freedom -- living free and prospering -- even make a<br>
fortune! -- then I suggest you seriously consider the<br>
Economic Means to Freedom.<br>
