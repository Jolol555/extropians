General Relativity determines the cosmic speed limit by the bent or "warped"<br>
geometry of the universe which can be further stretched in theory by a<br>
Black-White hole held open by a large Casimir Effect Capacitor called a Worm<br>
Hole.  In this case FTL travel is allowed and therefore reverse time travel is<br>
allowed as well and therefore "snatching people from the past", etc. becomes<br>
possible.  Kip Thorne and friends who pioneered this Worm Hole aspect of<br>
theoretical physics at CalTech have solved the twin paradox for inanimate<br>
systems (without free will) but the twin paradox is still not completely worked<br>
out for reverse time travel anyway.  Regardless, to do this engineering of<br>
stellar mass to generate incipient Black Holes and then the huge Casimir Effect<br>
Capacitors would need to be figured out which is beyond the realm of present<br>
day technology by many orders of magnitude.  And yes I agree with you (and<br>
Stephen Hawking) that the apparent absence of time travel tourists flocking to<br>
watch history literally in the making is good support or negative evidence that<br>
Worm Holes may not be possible. Period.  Although an "arbitrarily advanced<br>
civilization" as Kip puts it may have a Prime Directive kind of law or culture<br>
in place so that any visitors are covert spies but that sounds too much like<br>
the X Files for me to be comfortable with it.  The paranoid sound of "Visitors<br>
in our midst" kind of thing is sort of eerie.  -Bill.<br>
