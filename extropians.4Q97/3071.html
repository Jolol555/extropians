Greg Butler asks:<br>
<i>&gt;"What is it about 'social justice' that requires the distinction from plain</i><br>
old justice?  And, since plain old justice *wasn't* mentioned, does that<br>
mean 'social justice' is more important than normal justice?"<br>
<p>
Mr. Butler has asked a very good question that deserves a very good and<br>
therefore a detailed answer.<br>
<p>
The current civil legal system (and/or justice system) is theoretically<br>
based primarily on the perception or goal of individual equity in<br>
jurisprudence and protecting the rights of the individual. NOTE: As with all<br>
political systems, it is understood (apriori) that it is flawed.<br>
An exception -- limited though it is -- are class actions designed to obtain<br>
equity resolutions for groups injured by an individual's wrongs. (In this<br>
regard a corporation is considered an individual for purposes of tort<br>
litigation.)<br>
<p>
My concern, in this limited instance, is the hopeful expansion of the<br>
legal -- and social paradigm -- to include the understanding that true<br>
equity resolutions necessary for the creation of an ideal social order are<br>
best focused on relieving (or eliminating) a society of as many of the<br>
inequities that exist among its members as may be possible.<br>
<p>
In the broader sense my argumentum philisophicus is that as learning and<br>
understanding increase on a broader and broader scale with a presumed and<br>
accompanied increase in the ability to engage in continuous critical<br>
thinking and reasoning, actions determined by the superficiality of opinion<br>
based on emotion (rather than reason) will decline in equal geometric<br>
proportion.<br>
<p>
I trust that this response will produce a serious constructive dialogue on<br>
the improvement of the human condition.<br>
<p>
Happy New Year to one and all,<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt; Allow me to suggest, however, that continuous improvement in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; martial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; arts or any other form of physical self-defence might be best deferred</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; advance of first achieving the ability to engage in continuous</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; critical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reasoning and  the ability to make broad based value judgements that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wholly concerned with reason, social justice, equity  and devoid of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; selfishness, passion and unneeded emotion.</i><br>
