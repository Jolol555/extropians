Clemens Pittino &lt;pittino@magnet.at&gt; asked about the copy paradox:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you digitize your brain, you can copy it exactly. Who am I, if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would let run my mind on 2 hosts ?</i><br>
<p>
	There are many forms of the copy paradox idea.  The most<br>
popular deals with the idea of a "transporter" in the Science Fiction<br>
Stories of Star Trek so I'll give what I feel to be the answer to this<br>
issue based on the transporter idea.<br>
<p>
	For discussion purposes, I'll use the names Dup and Trans.<br>
Dup1 walked into a non destructive transporter and walked out of this<br>
same machine unchanged, yet scanned.  Then an identical Dup2 walked<br>
out of the reproducer part some distance away from this scanning<br>
machine.  Trans1 walked into a similar scanning machine but was<br>
completely taken apart atom by atom before an identical Trans2 was<br>
constructed out of different yet identical stuff some distance away.<br>
<p>
	The problem of what it would be like is similar to the problem<br>
of other minds.  Of course if you are Dup1 you will be extremely<br>
annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.  And of<br>
course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even<br>
though Trans2 claims he is the same.  If you were Trans2 you would<br>
have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1<br>
was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported<br>
Trans.  Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the<br>
original Dup and Dup1 would equally annoy you by claiming he was the<br>
real Dup.<br>
<p>
	The primary answer is, if you are the same, you will not be<br>
able to tell the difference between the two, including the particular<br>
feelings and memories being felt by the two now separate copies.  If<br>
you were dup1, you would feel exactly the same as dup2.<br>
<p>
	"Then what is it that is you?" one may ask.  I believe, it is<br>
your state or shape.  If you organized the proper stuff(*1) into this<br>
proper shape it would be you.  Whether it was done a googol years ago,<br>
whether it was done in a googol years from now or whether it was done<br>
in a newly created similar universe different and completely separate<br>
from our own and whether it was done a googol times here today.  (Even<br>
though you may have to be like God to be able to do this or at least<br>
to come up with the complete information required to duplicate someone<br>
that was say cremated 1000 years ago.)  This shape of you is self<br>
existent.  This fact about you can't be created by any God nor<br>
destroyed by even the universe ceasing to exist.  It is a logically<br>
necessary fact that you can exist.  Your existence proves this.<br>
<p>
	Dup1 and Dup2, after living a day, their state would start to<br>
diverge.  Hence, they would become different people.  This would be<br>
similar to the way you are different than the you that existed<br>
yesterday because of your new memories and other changes.  To the<br>
degree that we are the same as our parents, we are the same person.<br>
To the degree that we are in a different state, we are different<br>
people.<br>
<p>
	One of the primary reasons we are unsatisfied with such an<br>
answer has a lot to do with the philosophical "problem of other<br>
minds".  We simply can't "eff" what it is like to be us, and we<br>
thereby can't know if our copy is really indistinguishable from<br>
ourselves.  Maybe the copy is some unfeeling (or "absent qualia")<br>
zombie simply acting the same?  If we can solve the problem of other<br>
minds by discovering what qualia and consciousness really are<br>
objectively we can eliminate such dilemmas or "conundrums", or<br>
"paradoxes".  We simply must be able to "eff" the ineffable.  Such<br>
(mind melding?) will solve all these problems.<br>
<p>
	I believe that we will be able to some day augment our brain<br>
with generic qualia experiencing machinery similar to that which we<br>
have now that can reproduce the consciousness going on in others<br>
brains, by monitoring and duplicating whatever activity is producing<br>
such, in our own brains.  To me such direct conscious communication or<br>
"effing" is a much easier thing to do than the duplicator/transporter<br>
we are talking about.  Discovering what qualia/consciousness are and<br>
then effing such in this way is surely easier than creating a<br>
duplicator.  (Maybe we'll have to wait until God gives us such "mind<br>
meld" technology?  ;) If you have such an augmented brain you will be<br>
able to connect up with or monitor the other Dup in such a way that<br>
you are conscious of both what you are experiencing and what the other<br>
Dup is experiencing.  Such would solve the problem of other minds,<br>
eliminate the "conundrum" or the "paradox", and allow you to say yes<br>
that other Dup is indeed the same as me.  ("Your different than me<br>
because thats not the way salt tastes to me!", you may say when<br>
monitoring my brain with your newly augmented brain.)<br>
<p>
	So, there is no copy paradox, or even problem of other minds,<br>
if we can achieve the ability to eff what others are experiencing.<br>
<p>
(*1) If you insist on something mysterious or ghost like being<br>
included in this "stuff" that you are made of the argument still<br>
applies although at a slightly different level(*2).  If one of you<br>
exists it simply proves it is possible for you to exist.  I think you<br>
could create another identical universe with the same set of souls no<br>
matter what the soul is.  I believe it will be possible to duplicate<br>
whatever it is that is us.  Even if you have to be like God to do it.<br>
<p>
(*2) Unleas of course you believe in some sort of you that is not<br>
duplicatable.  But this is an extremely pessimistic view since if your<br>
not duplicatable then you are probably also not fixable or improvable<br>
and you will forever be stuck with being less than or equal to what<br>
you are today.<br>
