<i>        &gt;"Mental state" is a bit ambigous. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Bit yes ambiguous no. Unless the holly rollers turn out to be right the human <br>
brain must be equivalent to a Turing machine and the human mind equivalent to <br>
what a Turing machine does. What a Turing machine does is determined by the <br>
state it's in, and that depends on whether it sees a 0 or a 1 on a paper tape. <br>
How could anything be less ambiguous than that? <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think the traditional line of thinking goes like this: The thought         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"Mary loves John." involves the same concepts as "John loves Mary.",         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;namely the concepts "John", "loves" and "Mary". Nevertheless the two        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;thoughts are quite distinct. </i><br>
                               <br>
<p>
You're using the word "concept" in a somewhat more restrictive manner than I <br>
was, but that's OK.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;rather than saying that you are a collection of concepts, you have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to say that you are a collection of conceps cum a structure defined         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;on that collection. </i><br>
          <br>
If I use your implied definition of "concept" then I certainly agree.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And I don't think it makes literal sense to say that this collection         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;cum structure is an adjective -- it would be more correct to say         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that it was a proposition.</i><br>
          <br>
Perhaps, but the important point is that it's not a noun.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;At this point I may also ask you if you don't think that feelings         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and values and desires enters in what constitutes being you?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certainly, but I don't think it's " mental state" that's ambiguous, I think <br>
it's the dividing line between, concepts, thoughts, feelings, values and  <br>
desires.  These are just fuzzy categories we sometimes find convenient to put <br>
our various mental states into.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Moreover, in order to be a human being, it is not enough to be a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;person. </i><br>
<p>
True but unimportant. The important part is the person, a human being is just <br>
a bag of protoplasm.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;One also has to belong to the human species, and whether one does so         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;presumably depends on one's ancestry and one's biological         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;constitution, not just on one's thoughts or concepts.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
What's so great about belonging to the human species? A human being is an  <br>
animal so of course it must be biological, but the same is not true of a <br>
person.<br>
  <br>
In my opinion at the present time the most valuable thing in the universe is <br>
3 pounds of gray goo inside the head of a particular bipedal ape descendant, <br>
others may have a slightly different opinion. The reason this goo is so <br>
valuable is that it's rare, in fact it's the only object in the universe that <br>
acts in a johnclarkish way. There is no law of physics that forbids 2 or more <br>
objects acting that way, the fact that there's only one is just a historical <br>
accident. Things change.<br>
                        <br>
