<p>
How rude. Apparently they have no concept of property rights... ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Hmmmmmm. Earth as bacteria. Unfortunately, they haven't been observed<br>
having any traction against the Zero Point Field.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or a senile Monolith is trying to teach us about the wheel.</i><br>
<p>
Must be a government Monolith. It saw us thousands of light years away<br>
as primitives, took a couple thousand years to have studies done, review<br>
all of the differing scientific opinions, tried to push it through the<br>
Galactic Congress, but it got stuck in committee for another thousand<br>
years, as the Chairman of the Committee didn't like the Monolith<br>
nominated to go; he thought it supported politically incorrect<br>
technologies. So the other member planetary bodies of the committee had<br>
to gather signatures to override the Chairman's decision, and finally<br>
had hearings and then turned down the nominated Monolith. The President<br>
then nominated a completely incompetent and unqualified paperpusher who<br>
happened to have some good connections, and it got approved. So the<br>
incompetent Monolith undertook its eons long mission to travel here at<br>
sublight speeds, and once it got here found we had already invented the<br>
wheel, but since it made the effort, and the Galactic government had<br>
budgeted $20 Googolbucks for the project it was gonna reteach it to us<br>
anyways, so it started making funny circles in fields of monoculture<br>
cereals, since if the money wasn't spent this megayear, then they<br>
wouldn't get the same level of appropriation in the next fiscal<br>
megayear, which would mean a loss of power and prestige for the<br>
Secretary of the Galactic Department of State. Seeing the outcome, there<br>
were classified discussions in the Intelligence Committee on whether<br>
they should manipulate us into blowing ourselves to smithereens in a<br>
nuclear holocaust, just to push us back to the stone age, so the<br>
Monolith could then really teach us about the wheel. Makes the USSR look<br>
like a model of efficiency...<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; } Danny, whether or not aliens built crop circles is about as interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; } to me as whether the Mayans or the Incas built some particular burial</i><br>
<i>&gt; } mound, unless the fact dictates a particular course of action.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is harsh.  That aliens caused crop circles would indeed be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.  It would teach us not only that there were other people,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but that they were deranged people.  This is at least as interesting as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Martian bacteria, the past existence of which also fails to dictate any</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular course of action.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Although I suppose that our cattle would be the ones really de-ranged by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the loss of their feed.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the aliens figure that since they already mutilated the cattle,<br>
then that wheat wasn't really needed....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Speaking of aliens, Babylon-5 is back!</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's occurred to me that Banks and Vinge are like Star Trek and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Babylon-5, respectively, but with much more SF imagination.  Or that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Banks is a Trek version of Vinge.  Or what Trek should have been.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, I had to stay up late to watch it.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, what's with that. I've got to deal with waking up all groggy for<br>
work on Monday if I want to catch BV at midnight on Sunday night. I<br>
swear its a government/media conspiracy to prevent quality science<br>
fiction from reaching the masses, for fear that the masses might<br>
actually develop an imagination.... oh my. (DON"T ask me about my VCR)<br>
