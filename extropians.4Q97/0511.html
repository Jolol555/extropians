<i>&gt; The only objective meaning of "infinitely complex" I can think of is</i><br>
<i>&gt; axiomatically true: "mathematics" is simply "the set theorems expressible</i><br>
<i>&gt; in mathematical terms".  The cardinality of that set is that same as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cardinality of largest set of symbols in the language.  We can never</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually write down more than Aleph-null theorems (the number of integers),</i><br>
<i>&gt; but since mathematics includes real numbers, of which there are Aleph-one,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cardinality of mathematical theorems is at least that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Godel really has nothing to do with complexity at all.  It is nothing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the proof that of that infinite number of mathematical theorems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the set of "true" theorems and the set of "provable" ones differ.</i><br>

Actually, you can define infinite complexity if you are using<br>
algorithmic information theory. The algorithmic complexity of something<br>
is the length of the shortest computer program (for a given Turing machine)<br>
that can produce it; for a random sequence of bits the complexity is<br>
maximal. If something that has an infinite size can be generated by<br>
a finite program it has a finite complexity, of course. But one could<br>
imagine systems that require infinite programs. Gödel's theorem seem<br>
to imply that such programs are needed for sufficiently complex <br>
formal systems: you cannot generate all theorems using any finite<br>
program; however, you can at least create a program of "length"<br>
Aleph-null to generate them (simply by concatenating all the<br>
possible theorems and adding a trivial lookup function so that<br>
it can give you theorem X). So mathematics is infinitely complex,<br>
for the right definition of complexity.<br>
<p>
Personally I'm not sure algorithmic complexity is the best definition;<br>
but at least we can use it and it has interesting ties to a lot of other<br>
fields. <br>
<p>
[Fun idea: systems where the cardinality of theorems is larger than<br>
Aleph-null. For example, the axioms may be parametrized with real<br>
numbers like "if X is a theorem, then S(X,lambda) is a theorem for<br>
all real lambda". Or can they be collapsed into the "usual" kind of<br>
systems?]<br>
