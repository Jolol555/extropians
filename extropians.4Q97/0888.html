            Comments on the Persecution <br>
             of Scientologists in Europe<br>
                    by Sean Gabb<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Failures of the Debate on Europe<br>
<p>
One of the great limitations on the debate over Europe at the moment is<br>
that it is conducted almost entirely in terms of economics.  We are<br>
told, for example, that closer integration means more regulation from<br>
Brussels, and therefore fewer jobs, lower profits, and a general sinking<br>
towards the European average from which we have so conspicuously<br>
diverged.<br>
<p>
Of course, these are true points.  A United States of Europe - or<br>
anything corresponding to it - is not in British economic interests.<br>
But this is not the end of the story.  There are other aspects of<br>
European life which would be established in this country, and which<br>
would be at least as alien and alarming to us as the Common Agricultural<br>
Policy, the Single Currency, or all the other horrors so well described<br>
by Christopher Booker in his Sunday Telegraph articles.<br>
<p>
<p>
Persecution of the Scientologists<br>
<p>
In particular, there is what we must regard as the odd attitude of the<br>
German Government to religious non-conformity.  Today, several thousand<br>
members of the Church of Scientology demonstrated in Berlin against what<br>
they see as religious persecution by the German authorities.<br>
<p>
They are not alone in believing themselves persecuted.  In January this<br>
year, an advertisement appeared in the American newspaper press carrying<br>
the signatures of various Hollywood celebrities.  There was Dustin<br>
Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, Aaron Spelling, Oliver Stone, Mario Puzo, and Gore<br>
Vidal among 34 others - none, to my knowledge, Scientologists or even<br>
very religious.  What they had signed was an open letter to Helmut Kohl,<br>
the German Chancellor, protesting at the behaviour of his Party and his<br>
Government towards the Church of Scientology.  "In the Germany of the<br>
1930s" they wrote, "Hitler made religious intolerance official<br>
government policy.  In the 1930s, it was the Jews.  Today, it is the<br>
Scientologists."  The authors continue - none, by the way is a<br>
Scientologist - with a plea for Herr Kohl to "bring an end to this<br>
shameful pattern of organised persecution".<br>
<p>
Perhaps we can ignore celebrities.  So many of them embrace such bizarre<br>
causes that none of them can be reliably trusted on any matter external<br>
to their own careers.  However, their claims are supported by the State<br>
Department in Washington.  In its annual survey of human rights around<br>
the world, it lists Germany beside China, Cuba and Burma as a country in<br>
which human rights were abused in 1996.  And the abused rights in<br>
question were those of German Scientologists - people against whom there<br>
was, according to the State Department, a "campaign of harassment and<br>
intimidation".  The German Government has also been criticised in a<br>
human rights report issued by a team of British scholars that includes<br>
Dr Dennis O'Keeffe, a devout Catholic, and Professor Antony Flew, an<br>
atheist and expert on David Hume.<br>
<p>
I accept that comparisons with the holocaust are inappropriate.  People<br>
have not yet been robbed of all they possess in Germany, nor stripped of<br>
their citizenship, nor herded into slave camps, nor murdered on a vast<br>
scale.  Even so, not all is well in Germany.  Look beneath the veneer of<br>
tolerance, and German society has neither understanding of nor patience<br>
with any but the established Catholic and Protestant churches.  To some<br>
extent, Muslims and Buddhists are excluded from German national life, as<br>
are adherents of many other new and minority religions.  But to be a<br>
Scientologist seems to be worst of all.  To be one of these is to risk<br>
all sorts of official and officially-sponsored discrimination.  In<br>
Bavaria, for example, firms run by Scientologist have been barred from<br>
tendering for public contracts.  Applicants for jobs in the public<br>
sector must disclose their religious affiliation:  if that turns out to<br>
be to the Church of Scientology, they are passed over.  The Church has<br>
even been placed under surveillance by the Bavarian security services.<br>
<p>
In the private sector, Scientologists are rejected by some banks when<br>
they try to open accounts.  Scientologist-owned businesses have been<br>
vandalised.  Individual Scientologists have received anonymous hate<br>
mail.  Artists and performers known to be Scientologist have been<br>
blacklisted.  Chick Corea, an American jazz pianist who is also a<br>
Scientologist, had to cut short his tour in Germany last year, because<br>
he was refused permission to play in certain venues.  The youth wing of<br>
the Christian Social Union, the junior partner in the German Government,<br>
picketed performances of the film Mission Impossible because its star,<br>
Tom Cruise, is a well-known Scientologist.<br>
<p>
<p>
Forcing People to be "Free"<br>
<p>
What makes all this worse is the manner in which international<br>
condemnation has been brushed aside.  When the Soviets filled their<br>
lunatic asylums with dissidents, they at least had the humanity to be<br>
ashamed.  The German Government is simply angry and astonished.  Herr<br>
Kohl has dismissed the criticism with a sneering attack on the ignorance<br>
of foreigners.  Bernd Protzner, the General Secretary of the Christian<br>
Social Union, actually claims that "influential circles in the State<br>
Department have obviously fallen for Scientology's hate campaign against<br>
Germany and have let themselves be used by the sect."<br>
<p>
Whatever their political background, prominent Germans make the same<br>
defence of the anti-Scientology Kulturkampf.  The Constitution they gave<br>
themselves after the War obliges them to protect democracy and human<br>
rights.  No one familiar with George Orwell will be surprised that this<br>
allows them to persecute any group officially deemed undemocratic.  It<br>
is also justifies a strongly "positive" view of human rights.  According<br>
to German Government spokesman Peter Hausmann, his country can be proud<br>
of its human rights record.  It stands up well to any international<br>
comparison.  "It is the obligation of all public bodies to protect the<br>
human dignity of its citizens" he explained.  "That includes their<br>
physical and mental safety".  Any Nazi or Marxist would be proud of so<br>
clear a statement of the old "forcing people to be free" defence of<br>
tyranny.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Pan-European Taste for Persecution<br>
<p>
If this were a purely German oddity, it might not say much against the<br>
European project.  The problem is that the Germans are not alone in<br>
their intolerance of religious dissent.  The Greek Government takes it<br>
for granted that only communicants of the Orthodox Church can be real<br>
Greeks:  All the others are potential traitors who need to be watched.<br>
The French, for all they have canonised Voltaire as their patron saint<br>
of tolerance, are little better.  "I share the apprehensions of the<br>
Germans regarding these sects" their Foreign Minister, Hervé de<br>
Charette, said recently.  He went out of his way to denounce the<br>
Hollywood open letter, and to express his government's full support of<br>
Germany in its war against Scientology.<br>
<p>
Now, Scientology is seen by many as a strange kind of religion.<br>
Outsiders do tend to regard its theological claims as unlikely.  Then<br>
again, most religions seem strange to outsiders; and I do not find the<br>
stories about Thetans and Engrams any more inherently unlikely that I do<br>
stories about the parting of the Red Sea or the Resurrection of Christ.<br>
Indeed, what Scientologist theology I have read makes rather more sense<br>
to me than the Athanasian Creed.  But questions of religious truth or<br>
falsehood are not the point.  The point is that everyone ought to have<br>
the right to worship as their conscience demands.  It is not for<br>
governments or anyone else to pick and choose among religions,<br>
tolerating some but not others.  It is the duty of government to provide<br>
an impartial framework of laws within which life, liberty and property<br>
are respected.<br>
<p>
<p>
British Freedom<br>
<p>
Even here in Britain, there are calls for persecution.  In The Evening<br>
Standard for last Thursday (23rd October 1997), there is a story on the<br>
front page - "Action call on London 'Christ' cult' - about how some<br>
Labour MP wants an official investigation into a religious movement<br>
called the London Church of Christ.  Its offence, apparently, is that it<br>
recruits adults and persuades them to stop going out to night clubs, in<br>
favour of studying The Bible and recruiting others to do likewise.<br>
<p>
To its credit, persecution has so far been the policy of the British<br>
Government in religious matters.  The Home Office recently accepted<br>
Scientology leaders as ministers of religion for immigration purposes.<br>
Inform, its approved consultant on new religious movements, has advised<br>
the Independent Television Commission to accept Scientologist public<br>
awareness films for showing on British television.  The Church of<br>
Scientology has applied for charitable status.  Whether or not this is<br>
granted, we can be sure that the Charities Commission will base its<br>
decision on objective criteria, and not on public or official hysteria.<br>
For the moment, we remain what we have long been - one of the great<br>
world centres of religious liberty.<br>
<p>
To what extent would this change if our Maastricht opt-outs were<br>
replaced by a complete acceptance of European social policy?  Would our<br>
churches also have to be registered with the authorities, as in much of<br>
Europe?  Would some be favoured with grants and public acceptance?<br>
Would others be rejected and even persecuted under cover of concern<br>
about the public good?  Looking at the balance of Continental opinion,<br>
the answer at the moment seems to be yes:  our traditions of religious<br>
liberty would go the way of our ancient weights and measures, harmonised<br>
out of existence.<br>
<p>
Important as they are, the debate over Europe is about more than<br>
economics.  It is also about different views of the world.  Ours, on the<br>
whole, is the right view.  For myself, it is not a view I would<br>
surrender or endanger even if the economic arguments all pointed us<br>
towards closer integration.<br>
<p>
<p>
Afterword<br>
<p>
It ought not be necessary for me to go on and say more.  However, the<br>
usual statist response to criticism is to throw doubt on the critic's<br>
motives.  Logically, it is of no importance why I have written the<br>
above.  But a regard for logic has never been part of the statist<br>
intellectual armoury.  I therefore add the following disclaimers in<br>
advance:<br>
<p>
1.  I have not been paid to write this article.<br>
<p>
2.  I am not, nor ever have been, a member of the Church of Scientology.<br>
<p>
If anyone cares to reply, let it be on the substantive issues raised<br>
above.  <br>
