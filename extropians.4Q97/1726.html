Arjen, and eavesdroppers, <br>
<p>
I was not offended by your taking our discussion public, but its effect on my<br>
workload vexes me.  Frankly, I do not think that most casual observers do a<br>
very good job with the complicated and subtle issues at stake.  Even some<br>
interested parties flub them.  While I'll let a great many silly statements<br>
by third parties slip by, a few inevitably pop up that might harm ExI's<br>
interests if not challenged (or so I, a worrywort about ExI's intellectual<br>
property, judge).  I did not mind teaching trademark and unfair competition<br>
law when paid as professor to do so, and I did not mind writing briefs on the<br>
subject when I worked as an attorney in Silicon Valley.  But I've got a life<br>
now, for Newton's sake, and better things to do.<br>
<p>
Still, if the public appeal for new names generates an alternative label that<br>
satisfies all parties, I'd regard that as ample recompense.<br>
<p>
Tom<br>
