Apologies if this appears on the list more than once--I'm still having<br>
trouble with extropy.org...<br>
<p>
Estacado:<br>
<p>
In the past, I've asked you questions, sincerely, and you haven't deigned<br>
to answer them.<br>
<p>
I've also poked some fun at some material you hold dear. Oh well. It is<br>
supposed to be impossible to insult someone who is sure of emself, but on<br>
the other hand, a gentleman is supposed to be one who never gives offense<br>
unintentionally. With the latter in mind:<br>
<p>
If you find the prospect of rational discourse with me unpleasant because<br>
of my making light of the Neo-Tech materials, I regret that. <br>
<p>
I hold people who have a handle on ultimate truth to a higher standard,<br>
though, so I may still engage in (clearly marked) sarcasm. Any question or<br>
statement I prefix with (po) is not intended sarcastically; please consider<br>
it as objectively as you can, and reply in kind.<br>
<p>
WARNING: If you can sort the sarcasm out and deal with it separately,<br>
great! You'll have convinced me you have at least a low-level mastery of<br>
the Neo-Tech materials. If you *can't*, I'll know you for what you are and<br>
_so will everyone else who has studied Objectivism or Neo-Tech_. <br>
<p>
See, some of us have read the materials, mined them for value and *STILL*<br>
don't fit the model of the people who wrote the Neo-Tech materials.<br>
Mind-blowing, but true.<br>
<p>
SO...<br>
<p>
Estacado, I'm going to start fresh, and ask YOU, specifically, a few more<br>
questions; and I am genuinely interested in your answers. At the risk of<br>
being tedious, I'm going to number the questions. Please respond to as many<br>
of the questions as you can, and include the number in your response.<br>
<p>
If you reply intelligibly to them, in your own words, with something other<br>
than a citation to a (_that_) web page, great. Otherwise, I'll assume<br>
you're a Zon-bot and wave my *PLONK*er.<br>
<p>
However, just this once...<br>
<p>
At 11:00 PM 10/7/97 -0400, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;The Non-Aggression Principle is concisely formulated as: </i><br>
<i>&gt;"that no one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force  </i><br>
<i>&gt;against another human being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation."&lt;&lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Says who [?]</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm on&gt;<br>
<p>
   I am in awe of your sophisticated capacity for ratiocination and discourse.<br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br>
<p>
Umm, *I* just said so--for the purpose of discussion. Other people have<br>
said it, too, but it doesn't much matter who said it... unless you believe<br>
that the truth, falsehood or utility of a concept or definition depends on<br>
who says it. <br>
(po 1) Is that what you believe? <br>
(po 2) If that is what you believe, how does that fit in with<br>
Objectivism/objectivity? <br>
(po 3) If it is not what you believe, why did you ask? <br>
(po 4) Could it be that you are not interested in the truth, but merely in<br>
winning an argument?<br>
(po 5) Hmmm. That would be neocheating, wouldn't it? <br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm on&gt;<br>
<p>
   Of course, since it wasn't a quote from the Neo-Tech materials, it can't<br>
be useful *or* True.<br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and why should we care?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm on&gt;<br>
<p>
   "We"?<br>
<p>
&lt;sarcastic thread #1&gt;<br>
<p>
      Oh, I get it. Multiple personality. Very well.<br>
      I'll need the names and personality outlines of all your parts <br>
      before I can craft an appropriate answer....<br>
<p>
&lt;sarcastic thread #2&gt;<br>
<p>
      Maybe you were in too much of a hurry to notice, but <br>
      I used a little thing that we call "direct address"--<br>
      I started my post by calling Erik _by name_.<br>
<p>
&lt;end sarcastic threads #1, #2&gt;<br>
<p>
   ...OH! I get it! One of your parts IS NAMED ERIK!!!<br>
   Sorry, I didn't know. OK, I'll speak really slow:<br>
<p>
   DUUUHHH. It's an IDEA, ERIKSTACADO. <br>
   SOME of us find ideas to be WORTH DISCUSSING. <br>
   And, UHHHH, you know, like, uuuh, TH... <br>
   what's that word? THINKING about, yeah. Duuuh.<br>
<p>
&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br>
<p>
Hmm. No reason at all why you, Estacado, should care. Especially since you<br>
have shown some signs of being the kind of person I referred to in the part<br>
of my post you didn't quote, to wit: people who think they are thinking<br>
when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.<br>
<p>
I'm not immune to that tendency myself. <br>
Since that's so, I'm not convinced you're a waste of time (yet).<br>
<p>
(po 6) May I suggest that you relax, settle down, and actually have a<br>
conversation or two?<br>
(po 7) I'm game. Are you?<br>
<p>
MMB<br>
giving it one more try<br>
