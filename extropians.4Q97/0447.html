<i>&gt; From: Dan@Clemmensen.ShireNet.com [SMTP:Dan@Clemmensen.ShireNet.com]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I use the term "singularity" in deference to Vinge, who is a =</i><br>
professor<br>
<i>&gt; of mathematics. It's only a qualitative analogy, however: the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplest equations that describe the simplest qualitative predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't actually have mathematical singularities.</i><br>
<p>
This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in =<br>
discussions<br>
of the "singularity".=A0 While a simple interpolation and future<br>
projection of (for example) available computing power may show a<br>
vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of<br>
computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a<br>
flattening of the curve.<br>
<p>
I'd be very interested in seeing (and would write myself, if time and<br>
knowledge allowed) an analysis of what a post-"singularity" plateau<br>
might look like, given the most stringent constraints we know of.=A0<br>
Obviously these constraints are products of our current understanding =<br>
of<br>
the world, and thus may be suppressible given some future physics &amp;<br>
mathematics, but I think it a bit disingenuous to use a term like<br>
"singularity" when our best current models of the world show bounded =<br>
(or<br>
at least, merely exponential) growth.<br>
<p>
There are much wiser heads out there on this list, so let me just start<br>
off the conversation with a few constraints that I can see (again, =<br>
given<br>
our current physics &amp; mathematics):<br>
<p>
Size Constraints:=A0 Our current understanding of QM essentially<br>
constrains the precision with which we can build physical structures =<br>
(or<br>
direct energy) via Planck's constant, thus creating an apparent lower<br>
bound on our engineering ambitions.=A0 This in turn has consequences =<br>
for<br>
Moore's Law, as to date progress has been made largely via finer and<br>
finer lithography techniques.=A0<br>
<p>
Speed Constraints:=A0 Barring some revolution to Relativity, c limits =<br>
the<br>
rate of expansion of even a Vingean Power.=A0 In addition it limits the<br>
speed of signaling within that entity's "brain".=A0 Again suggesting<br>
possible constraints on the rate of computational growth.<br>
<p>
Chaotic Computability Constraints:=A0 The most ambitious nanotech<br>
scenarios posit universal assemblers that can be programmed or designed<br>
to build specific structures.=A0 IMHO this is a clearly chaotic =<br>
system.=A0<br>
The structure of any complex object created by this sort of nanotech<br>
would seem to display an exquisite sensitivity to tiny variations in<br>
design of the assembler (or the assembler "software"), and possibly to<br>
the local environment itself.=A0 I question whether we'll be able to<br>
design assembler protocols for very complex objects through any means<br>
other than trial and error, which have their own pitfalls (e.g., grey<br>
goo).=A0<br>
<p>
(This is not to say that I'm skeptical of nanotech.=A0 I think the more<br>
prosaic nanotech scenarios have an enormous potential to revolutionize<br>
our world.=A0 If we can design nanomachines to construct individual =<br>
parts<br>
of more complex systems, for example, and then use macro-machines to<br>
assemble them into the finished product, we will have gone a long way<br>
towards eliminating scarcity.)<br>
<p>
I'm very interested in thoughts from the list on:<br>
<p>
1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.<br>
<p>
2) Just how severe and insurmountable these constraints are.=A0 Will<br>
superstring-engineering allow us to bypass Planck's constant?=A0 Will =<br>
some<br>
new, higher-level theory of complex systems provide more =<br>
computationally<br>
efficient means of simulating chaotic systems?=A0 Will quantum =<br>
computing<br>
have any benefit here?=A0 Can a sufficiently advanced entity construct =<br>
a<br>
pocket universe where Planck's constant and c are different from our<br>
own?=A0 Is there any way to communicate between that universe and this<br>
one?<br>
<p>
cheers,<br>
