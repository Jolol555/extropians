Wei then asked:<br>

<p>
John Clark also responded:<br>

<i>&gt;to survive for long. </i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<i>&gt;With reversible computing, ... Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that </i><br>

<p>
Wei posed the problem of cooling to get rid of excess local heat, by making<br>
contact with distant sources of negentropy (= max sys entropy - actual<br>
entropy)<br>
such as the cosmic background.  For this problem, the conservation of energy<br>
constraint is much less important than the constraint that total entropy<br>
cannot<br>
decrease.  In making my contribution to reversible computing<br>
(<a href="http://hanson.berkeley.edu/reverse.html">http://hanson.berkeley.edu/reverse.html</a>) I learned enough say with great <br>
confidence that there is no particular advantage to erasing bits at lower<br>
temperatures.  If it were otherwise you could make a perpetual motion machine:<br>
erase bits (= replace unknown bits with known bits) at low temps and then<br>
reverse the operation (replace known bits with unknown bits) at high temps.<br>
By the "costs less energy" intution this cycle would create available energy.<br>
