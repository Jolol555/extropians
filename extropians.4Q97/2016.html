<i>&gt; &gt;extropy.  Having to pay to join an institute to participate on a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;the signal-to-noise ratio.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't dispute that you have the experience of a culty feel. But I invite</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to consider the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is the Rotary a cult? is the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cult? Is 4-H a cult? Is the specialty-certified service station I take my</i><br>
<i>&gt; car to a cult? How about the letters-to-the-Editor column of Scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; American?</i><br>
<p>
I think the more important question is: Are these institutions really in<br>
danger of being labelled a cult?  When I show an issue of Extropy magazine<br>
to a friend, the first thing that happens is their cult-o-meter goes<br>
berzerk. Why?  Because Extropy is very radical, and it is<br>
all-encompassing.  The first sense people get is "these extropians are<br>
trying to tell me how to live."  Obviously, for those who actually read<br>
the magazine, this thought is ridiculous, but that doesn't stop perfectly<br>
intelligent people from making erroneous prejudgements.  I think it is in<br>
ExI's best interest to minimize these prejudgements, and the best way to<br>
go about that is reducing those things that may be miscontrued as "culty."<br>
The fact that you have to pay at least $100 dollars to join an institute<br>
to participate on a general extropian mailing list reeks of one of those<br>
cults where the members are wearing rags, and the leader is driving around<br>
in a Mercedes.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In each of these examples, members are selected, and "dues" of one sort or</i><br>
<i>&gt; another must have been paid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for participation in discussion, there's always the CRIT engine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bidirectional links permit open communication across the boundary, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; keeping the SSNR higher. Kind of like a sodium pump. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You say they don't know about CRIT? Well, they'll just have to learn, won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; they? :)</i><br>
<p>
What if they don't have web access?  Many of us are restricted to e-mail<br>
only services provided by our respective universities.  Limiting comments<br>
from university students seems to me to be a *very* bad idea.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, I don't think being a member of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extropy institute implies you make less "noise."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Being born a Presbyterian doesn't guarantee you a seat in the Choir Invisible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Some people may join the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Begging your pardon, it doesn't matter what their intent is, it matters</i><br>
<i>&gt; what the result is.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  Empiricism is important here.  In this respect, I think we<br>
should bow to those who have been here longest.  If you read Harvey<br>
Newstrom's post, you will see that making people pay does not reduce the<br>
S/NR ratio since those who paid think they are getting ripped off if they<br>
can't ramble on about irrelevant topics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some reasonable people think the SSNR is too high. One</i><br>
<i>&gt; man's signal is another man's noise. Otherwise, why not just have one big</i><br>
<i>&gt; maillist for everyone on the net? Reductio ad absurdum, QED, E Pluribus Unum.</i><br>
<p>
True.  Which is why those who think someone's post is noise should just<br>
ignore it.  If many people think it is noise, the noise-maker will get no<br>
replies, and get discouraged through silence not to post irrelevant<br>
material again.  The seems to me to be the best system (and most<br>
extropian)  Kennita Watson tend to be a strong advocate of this way of<br>
policing the list, and I agree.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Others, who would contribute a lot to the list, may not be interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;joining the extropy institute, either for monetary reasons or because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;do not want to incur the wrath of those who would take out their petty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;frustrations on the members of the extropian movement.(ie. misguided</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;neo-luddites) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every decision has a cost. Good people are not doing their best on the list</i><br>
<i>&gt; right now because of the current state of affairs.</i><br>
<p>
I think the cost is not worth the value.  If Harvey Newstrom is correct,<br>
S/NR will not change significantly, so what is the value of restricting<br>
posts to the list?<br>
 <br>
