Well, 'nother victory !!!<br>
<p>
Teleportation, with low energy required !!! ( You, as I said, just teleport<br>
the data, and discard all the matter of the original body...)<br>
<p>
Now, let's try to tune with events ocurred  some seconds late... I still<br>
suppose it will be necessary to replicate <br>
some brain functions, like those which happen in some (real) PES<br>
individuals' brains... ( Do they really project to the present such events ??? )<br>
<p>
Let's work !!!! (To the religious think about :::&gt;  we, the real scientists,<br>
will ressurrect (reinstall) even Jesus, babies...and this will be the end of<br>
YOUR poor existencial world ...) <br>

<i>&gt;Science fact: Scientists achieve 'Star Trek'-like feat</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;Picture: 'Beam me up' graphic&gt;December 10, 1997</i><br>
<i>&gt;Web posted at: 9:29 p.m. EST (0229 GMT) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have pulled off a startling </i><br>
<i>&gt;trick that looks like the "Beam-me-up, Scotty" </i><br>
<i>&gt;technology of science fiction. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In an Austrian laboratory, scientists destroyed bits of light </i><br>
<i>&gt;in one place and made perfect replicas appear about three</i><br>
<i>&gt; feet away. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They did that by transferring information about a crucial</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical characteristic of the original light bits, called photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The information was picked up by other photons, which took</i><br>
<i>&gt;on that characteristic and so became replicas of the originals. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The phenomenon that made it happen is so bizarre that even</i><br>
<i>&gt;Albert Einstein didn't believe in it. He called it spooky. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In addition to raising the rather fantastic notion of a new means of</i><br>
<i>&gt;transportation, the trick could lead to ultra-fast computers. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The experiment is reported in Thursday's issue of the journal</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nature by Anton Zeilinger and colleagues at the University of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Innsbruck in Austria. Another research team, based in Rome,</i><br>
<i>&gt;has done similar work and submitted its report to another journal. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The work is the first to demonstrate "quantum teleportation," </i><br>
<i>&gt;a bizarre shifting of physical characteristics between nature's</i><br>
<i>&gt;tiniest particles, no matter how far apart they are. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientists might be able to achieve teleportation between atoms </i><br>
<i>&gt;within a few years and molecules within a decade or so, Zeilinger said. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The underlying principle is fundamentally different from the "Star Trek" </i><br>
<i>&gt;process of beaming people around, but could teleportation be used on</i><br>
<i>&gt;people? Could scientists extract information from every tiny particle in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;person, transfer it to a bunch of particles elsewhere, and assemble those</i><br>
<i>&gt;particles into an exact replica of the person? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There's no theoretical problem with that, several experts said. </i><br>
<i>&gt;But get real. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I think it's quite clear that anything approximating teleportation </i><br>
<i>&gt;of complex living beings, even bacteria, is so far away technologically</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it's not really worth thinking about it," said IBM physicist Charles</i><br>
<i>&gt;H. Bennett. He and other physicists proposed quantum teleportation in 1993.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There would just be too much information to assemble and transmit,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they say. Even if it were possible someday, it would be so </i><br>
<i>&gt;expensive that "probably it's just as cheap to send the real person,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;said Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides, Schumacher said, teleportation would "kill you and take</i><br>
<i>&gt;you apart atom by atom so you could be reassembled at the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;end, one hopes. It doesn't seem like a good idea to me." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Much more likely, experts said, is using teleportation between </i><br>
<i>&gt;tiny particles to set up quantum computers. These devices would use</i><br>
<i>&gt;teleportation to sling data around, and they could solve certain complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems much faster than today's machines. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the new work, scientists transferred the trait of "polarization"</i><br>
<i>&gt;between photons. Light behaves like both a photon particle and as </i><br>
<i>&gt;a wave. A light wave has peaks and troughs like an ocean wave, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;polarization refers to the directions in which these peaks and troughs </i><br>
<i>&gt;point. Photons retain this trait. To transfer the polarization between </i><br>
<i>&gt;photons, the researchers used a phenomenon called entanglement, </i><br>
<i>&gt;which a disbelieving Einstein derided. Since then, however, it's been </i><br>
<i>&gt;shown to be real. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When two photons are entangled, "they have opposite luck," said </i><br>
<i>&gt;IBM's Bennett. Whatever happens to one is the opposite of what </i><br>
<i>&gt;happens to the other. In particular, their polarizations are the opposite </i><br>
<i>&gt;of each other. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here's how the Austrians took advantage of that: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Call three photons A, B and C, and assume the goal is to transmit A's</i><br>
<i>&gt;polarization to C. The researchers created B and C as entangled photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then they entangled B with A. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That second step destroyed A, but not before B took on the opposite </i><br>
<i>&gt;of A's original state. This change meant B's entangled partner, C, had to</i><br>
<i>&gt;change polarization to remain the opposite of B's. So C's polarization </i><br>
<i>&gt;ended up the same as A's used to be. The polarization was transmitted. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The process worked only 25 percent of the time because of how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment was set up. It's possible to go to 75 percent and scientists </i><br>
<i>&gt;will shoot for that, Zeilinger said. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the notion of entanglement leaves your head spinning, don't feel bad.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Zeilinger said he doesn't understand how it works either. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"And you can quote me on that," he said. </i><br>
