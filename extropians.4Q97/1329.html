<i>&gt;And these are only preliminary, preliminary thoughts.</i><br>
<p>
It's good to bring this up, and it is indeed part of the 'critical<br>
thinking' side of Extropianism.<br>
<p>
Going right back to fundamentals: it seems clear that we must accept<br>
that *any* technological creates new problems as it solves old ones<br>
(this is what we would expect from a Popperian analysis of knowledge).<br>
The question to focus on, as you suggest, is: does it create more, or<br>
more difficult and dangerous problems, than it solved?  I think the knee<br>
jerk response of the anti-technological is that it always must<br>
necessarily do so, and that's the bushfire we've got to pour cold water<br>
on.<br>
<p>
Also, we must remember that part of the seductiveness of the neo-primitive<br>
position is in the "better the devil you know" argument.  e.g., what's<br>
the use of progress if we are increasingly stressing ourselves out by<br>
having to juggle and balance more and more complexities against each<br>
other? Why start that process? Is the increase of possibilities such a<br>
great value when the price we have to pay is that we are unable to take<br>
advantage of them because we're having to devote so much time and energy<br>
to solving the problems that the mechanics of providing them create? What<br>
sorts of answers can we give to those questions?<br>
<p>
As an aside, my opinion on Bey is that he is merely clever and ridiculously<br>
vain.  Everyone ought to read him, but no-one ought to take him too<br>
seriously.  His one great meme is the TAZ, which I think has been<br>
(deservedly) quite influential.<br>
