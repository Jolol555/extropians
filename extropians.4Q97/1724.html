<p>
Not at all; I thought it pretty clever.  Anyone who gets upset by a clearly<br>
joking list of mere Ex-words sorely misundertands the principles at issue.<br>
 No one can own a word.  But organizations that use certain identifying marks<br>
do have the right to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks in<br>
similar circumstances.<br>
<p>
ExI would not have any claim against someone using "Extro" in, say, a news<br>
story about Extropianism.  It would probably not have a claim against someone<br>
naming, say, a shampoo "Extro".  But it would have a claim against someone<br>
using a similar mark to achieve similar goals--say, someone naming their<br>
transhumanist group "Ekstro."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about putting ExI next to names when refering top them?</i><br>
<p>
Not necessary; the marks alone should suffice.  Indeed, to follow this course<br>
of action might actually harm ExI's claims to the distinctiveness of its<br>
marks.  Thanks for trying to help, though.<br>
