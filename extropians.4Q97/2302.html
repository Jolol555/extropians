Vulnerable?  I always heard that they were used because they were<br>
stable.  They seemed miraculous: good for whatever they're good for,<br>
and unlikely to trouble anyone.  Basic chemistry: we're talking about<br>
halogen atoms bonded to carbon.  "Vulnerable" does not come to my mind.<br>
"Teflon" does.<br>
<p>
Yeah, they're vulnerable to sunlight -- to high energy ultraviolet rays.<br>
<p>
Now, hydrogen-CFCs -- HCFCs -- are different.  The current or almost<br>
current _Nature_ had a column bemoaning the rush to ban HCFCs along with<br>
CFCs.  CFCs are stable, very powerful greenhouse gases when released,<br>
and bad for ozone.  HCFCs have a life time of 1.4 years and thus won't<br>
make it to the ozone layer, and the letter argued that the energy<br>
savings their use provides offsets any greenhouse increase they may<br>
provide in that short lifetime.  It also argued that production does not<br>
have to equal eventual release, but I can't address that topic any<br>
further.<br>
