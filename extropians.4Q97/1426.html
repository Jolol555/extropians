Hmmm.  This changes the hypothetical situation completely.  I missed the<br>
part about having real-time updates.  I'm not sure this is the same copy<br>
scenario I was considering, since the original and the copy must share<br>
the same thoughts and cannot diverge or be disconnected.  Wouldn't<br>
killing the original create a disconnection or a divergence in<br>
experience that would raise the same objections?  The only complication<br>
with killing the original is that the only witness who would object to<br>
the procedure is silenced, and there is no longer an original reference<br>
with which to validate the copy.  This merely makes it harder to prove<br>
they are not the same, but does not make the procedure any more<br>
functional than if the original were allowed to live.  If the original<br>
is allowed to live, you agree that the copy and the original are not the<br>
same.  If you kill the original, I still maintain the same position,<br>
only now the copy is the closest thing to the original now remaining.<br>
<p>
It seems that you would still exist in your original body.  You are just<br>
experiencing a real-time simulation of what the copy is experiencing. <br>
When I disconnect the real-time update in preparation to kill the<br>
original, wouldn't the original object that it has lost contact with its<br>
second body and is now existing only in the original body?  Wouldn't the<br>
original have the same desire and curiosity to want to go continue<br>
experiencing life?  It almost seems that the copy argument for extending<br>
lifespan focusses on continuing information and services to other<br>
people.  If they do not perceive a change, the experiment is declared a<br>
success.  It does not focus on information and services still be<br>
provided to the original.  All such information and service is halted. <br>
The original ceases to function, but none of his external contacts care.<br>
