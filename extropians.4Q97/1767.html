I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:<br>
<p>
<p>
I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail &amp; I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!<br>
<p>
Hello!<br>
<p>
<p>
My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.<br>
<p>
<p>
About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! <br>
<p>
<p>
I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!<br>
<p>
<p>
My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!<br>
<p>
<p>
I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can do this, so can you!<br>
<p>
<p>
                       GO FOR IT NOW!!<br>
<p>
<p>
                       Karen Liddell<br>
<p>
<p>
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:<br>
<p>
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br>
<p>
<p>
This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.<br>
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!<br>
<p>
You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income.<br>
<p>
<p>
This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!  <br>
<p>
<p>
This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! <br>
<p>
<p>
Thousands of people have used this program to:<br>
    -  Raise capital to start their own business<br>
    -  Pay off debts<br>
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc., <br>
    -  Even retire! <br>
<p>
<p>
This is your chance, so don't pass it up!<br>
<p>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY <br>
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Basically, this is what we do:<br>
<p>
<p>
We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your computer).<br>
<p>
<p>
The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:<br>
<p>
<p>
  * $5.00 cash<br>
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering<br>
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.<br>
<p>
<p>
To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! <br>
<p>
<p>
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND<br>
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!<br>
<p>
<p>
******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******<br>
<p>
This is what you MUST do:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).<br>
     <br>
     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE <br>
        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR<br>
        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person<br>
        whose name appears on the list next to the report.<br>
  <br>
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the<br>
        four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you <br>
        can save them on your computer and resell them.<br>
<p>
<p>
     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of <br>
        the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will<br>
        be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people<br>
        who will order them from you.<br>
<p>
<p>
2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed<br>
     next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way<br>
     other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you<br>
     will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you <br>
     understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't<br>
     work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested,<br>
     and if you alter it, it will not work.<br>
<p>
<p>
    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.<br>
<p>
<p>
    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and<br>
        address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving<br>
        the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  <br>
<p>
<p>
    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to <br>
         REPORT #3.  <br>
<p>
<p>
    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to <br>
         REPORT #4.  <br>
<p>
<p>
    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from<br>
         the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.<br>
<p>
<p>
Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!<br>
<p>
3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, <br>
     and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction<br>
     portion of this letter.<br>
  <br>
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the<br>
     WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,<br>
     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another<br>
     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  <br>
     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you<br>
     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. <br>
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!<br>
<p>
<p>
5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the<br>
     report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE <br>
     ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send<br>
     out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because<br>
     they can't advertise until they receive the report!<br>
<p>

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.<br>
<p>
<p>
1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50<br>
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500<br>
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000<br>
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000<br>
                                                   THIS TOTALS        -----------&gt;$55,550<br>
<p>
<p>
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!<br>
<p>
<p>
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!<br>
<p>
<p>
About 50,000 new people get online every month!<br>
<p>
<p>
*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******<br>
<p>
 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow <br>
     the directions accurately.<br>
<p>
<p>
 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when <br>
    the orders start coming in because:<br>
<p>
<p>
    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested<br>
    product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws,<br>
    Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in<br>
    the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections <br>
    255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be <br>
    exchanged for money received."<br>
<p>
<p>
 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.<br>
<p>
<p>
 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the <br>
    instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!<br>
<p>
<p>
 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!<br>
<p>
<p>
*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******<br>
<p>
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:<br>
<p>
<p>
If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!<br>
<p>
<p>
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:<br>
<p>
<p>
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!<br>
<p>
<p>
NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name,                  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.<br>
<p>

<p>
     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. <br>

     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.<br>

<p>
    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!<br>
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC<br>
<p>
<p>
    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.<br>
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.<br>

<p>
    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!<br>
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN<br>
<p>
<p>
     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!<br>
