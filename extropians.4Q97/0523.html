Let me go further.  Dan, not only are there agreed on fundamental facts in<br>
economics, but if you knew more economics you would be much less likely to<br>
make your web-singularity predictions.  (Knowing more AI would also help.)<br>
<p>
The sort of singularity scenario you endorse *is* a claim about economics.<br>
And economic analysis is directly relevant to evaluating it.  If you don't<br>
think<br>
anyone knows enough about economics to say anything useful on this list,<br>
then you shouldn't think you know enough about it to make the predictions<br>
that you do.  <br>
<p>
To be even more explicit: most singularity claims can be thought of as<br>
claims about rates of economic growth.  So of direct relevance is our best<br>
understanding of <br>
sources and limits on such growth.  <br>
<p>
Your claim is, as best I understand it, that some new innovation in visual<br>
programming will raise average programmer productivity by say a factor of<br>
ten, and that there is some very strong non-linear dependence of world<br>
economic growth rates on such productivity and the size of the web, a type<br>
of non-linearity which only appears above some as yet unreached threshold<br>
combination of productivity and connectivity, and which continues strong<br>
through many orders of magnitude of growth.  <br>
