<p>
Hmm, as far as I know there is no conservation of order plus entropy;<br>
order is simply the negative of entropy, and the sum must according to<br>
the laws of thermodynamics always go in the entropy direction. But<br>
regions can achieve as much order as they want if they have energy and<br>
can pump away the entropy. So the main questions are if there is<br>
enough energy in an open universe, and if there are enough entropy<br>
sinks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To picture what I am talking about imagine a bunch of molecules in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; box.  Let's say that at first they are all in one part of the box.  After a</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain amount of time, ceterus paribus, they will be spread out -- in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sense one would be likely to find them anywhere within the box.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This would be an equilibrium state -- or more, accurately, collection of</i><br>
<i>&gt; states.  Now imagine that the box can expand faster than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; molecules move.  The molecules will never be able to fill the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; box, in the sense of the first example.  One will always be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; give a rough estimate of where they are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now if the universe as a whole behaved like that...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that would be nice. Unfortunately this is the<br>
ball-of-galaxies-expanding-from-a-center-somewhere-in-a-big-void-model,<br>
and not compatible with what we know or believe. The universe seems to<br>
be expanding more like a big balloon with galaxies on its surface,<br>
being slowly blown up. That means we do not get any low-entropy<br>
regions for free, even when the spacetime expands. A pity.<br>
