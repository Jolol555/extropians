<i>&gt; &gt;How can two biologists exchange information about life in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Cambrian era, if they're constantly interrupted by biblical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;literalists saying there never was a Cambrian era?</i><br>
<p>
This is not a challenge, just a query.  Have we been having a lot of<br>
luddites on this list challenging basic scientific facts?  I have seen a<br>
couple of naive questions in the past few months, and only a few<br>
discussions about basic science.  I don't recall any major disruptions<br>
by people trying to prevent rational discussion.<br>
<p>
Discussing the basics is already against the list rules.  Can't<br>
violators be told that they are violating the list rules?  Has anyone<br>
notified certain posters that they were violating list rules without<br>
result?<br>
<p>
The only problems I have with the list is the occassional spam.  I don't<br>
expect spammers to respect the new rules any more than the old rules. <br>
Software will have to try to block them.<br>
