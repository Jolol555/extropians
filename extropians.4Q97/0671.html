Hi!<br>

First of all I would like to point out that I don't<br>
think you should talk of brain transplants, you should talk of body<br>
transplants. It's not because of any convention it's just because I<br>
think that what is being transplanted is not you but to you and since<br>
you are your brain, you can't transplant yourself, you can only make<br>
transplants of organs to yourself. Size is not important here and your<br>
brain can only receive transplants, in this case, body transplants.<br>
<p>
About body transplants using cloning to create new bodies, it's not such<br>
a futuristic<br>
achievement. Did you know that there has already been body transplants<br>
is monkeys and dogs? And that there are plans to try it on humans on a<br>
near future? Besides, human cloning can be technically possible in a<br>
very short time (some claim that it is already possible in the present).<br>

I'm not sure about this (so don't jump on me if I'm wrong) but I think<br>
that there is a relation between the time a mammal takes to reach sexual<br>
maturity and the size of the brain. We are the mammal with longest<br>
"childhood" and yet we are not the mammal with the more mass. If you<br>
were to clone brainless humans (which is technically debatable) I would<br>
say it would take much less than 19 years for you to get a fully grown<br>
human.<br>

<p>
The big problem is that it's not that linear that you are going to earn<br>
much more life years<br>
with this kind of procedure. Your neurons might die because of the death<br>
of the cells that support them (the glial cells) and since you won't<br>
transplant these cells, you would still die. Besides, the inherited risk<br>
to this kind of procedure is (and will be for quite some time) very high<br>
so it might not be worth it (I won't even mention the financial<br>
resources for such operation). On the other hand, it might allow for<br>
your<br>
body to better remove the dangerous toxins that accumulate in the brain<br>
(called age pigments) and therefore gain you years of life (since the<br>
immune system and the whole body will be new, it will work better). I<br>
wrote<br>
about body transplants in my site, in my life extension section and I'm<br>
currently developing that area.<br>
Personally I think that avoiding aging for us (already developed adults)<br>
is an interesting problem itself. Even that we do find a way to correct<br>
all the errors in the genome that cause aging, it will be very difficult<br>
to save us (I'm writing an article about that, BTW). There are a few<br>
theories but none is currently technically possible, which means that if<br>
we did find the genetic causes for aging (by far our best hope to<br>
control aging) we would still age and die. What do you think about it?<br>
<p>
Two more things of different subjects; Prof. Jose Gomes Filho, eu nunca<br>
respondi 'a tua mensagem porque siceramente nao tinha nada<br>
para dizer e nao por falta de educacao ou esquecimento.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg, I heard you were a neurologist or something like that.<br>
If that is true I would like to ask you a few questions: Can human<br>
neurons divide in adulthood? What about songbirds neurons (I read they<br>
could)? If you answer yes, can you tell how that happens or where can I<br>
find more information about it.<br>
<p>
See ya,<br>
