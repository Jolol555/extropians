<i>&gt;The current discontent over the membership proposal may be a sign that most</i><br>

<p>
I see no sign that suggests that to be the case. The discontent expressed<br>
by a few seems to be a mixture of concern among the less well off that they<br>
can afford the new member rate (a concern that can be relieved for those<br>
willing to contribute in other ways), and annoyance by some that ExI wants<br>
to make our email list a member benefit (with regard to posting) rather<br>
than keeping posting privileges open to those who don't support the Institute.<br>
<p>
Admittedly, I've been putting off a student membership for several<br>
<i>&gt;months now. </i><br>
<p>
Well, that turned out to be a good move, Keith, since the student rate is<br>
down to $30. Having been a student for many years myself, I appreciate the<br>
financial contraints, and so wish to accommodate students both with a lower<br>
membership rate, and also by allowing students to register for the<br>
conference at half the regular rate.<br>
<p>
But one thing is becoming clearer to me: whether or not I agree with<br>
<i>&gt;everything ExI has stated in the Extropian Principles, there is no other</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist organization as firmly established as ExI, and doing the</i><br>
amount of<br>
<i>&gt;work ExI seems to be doing (CM if I'm W -- Aleph?). Even though some</i><br>
aspects of<br>
<i>&gt;spontaneous order suggest a broad politic that I'm not ready to accept, I</i><br>
see no<br>
<i>&gt;need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.</i><br>
<p>
The Justice Department has recently been using the idea of network<br>
economies to justify prosecuting Microsoft. The bigger the network, the<br>
larger the internal benefits. The fact that (small as we are) ExI is the<br>
largest and most active transhumanist organization does give reason for<br>
those sympathetic to its goals to get on board. The more of us there are<br>
together, the more we can accomplish and the better the network functions.<br>
If people hold off joining because they don't want to join organizations<br>
(however that feeling is motivated) then we will have a hard time reaching<br>
a size able to make real changes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given that I have no time/motivation to start an organization on my own, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;membership in ExI will accomplish a few things for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. It will give me a concrete hand in the promotion of transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. It will (now) allow me participation in a list that I *already* look</i><br>
forward to<br>
<i>&gt;sifting through everyday.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. It will allow me to debate the Extropian principles with a little more</i><br>
<i>&gt;leverage.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, these are perhaps less tangible benefits that discounts on<br>
conferences, etc., yet no less real. Obviously some of these factors will<br>
be more valuable to some, less so to others. Some of us find it important<br>
to support the development and dissemination of these ideas, recognizing<br>
that not only are they beneficial to other people (the Benevolence Motive)<br>
but they also improve one's own chances of long-term survival and<br>
transformation (the Self-Interest Motive).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Purchasing a membership in ExI does not mean:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. I think ExI is the final word on transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. I am a libertarian, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. I will be a member next year.</i><br>
<p>
Well said, Keith. (1) You can be a member of ExI AND other transhumanist<br>
organizations, and you can not be completely sure about all the principles.<br>
(2) Being libertarian -- as I said a few times lately - is NOT a<br>
requirement of ExI membership, nor of being "extropian". Extropians do have<br>
a general appreciation of the role of spontaneous order and affirm<br>
self-ownership, but the precise economic and political implementation of<br>
those ideas is up to the individual extropian to decide. (See Extropy<br>
Online in about two weeks for my essay on Self-Ownership.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In short, there is work to be done, and ExI is shouldering a good part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;load. I think we all need to decide why we don't want to join, and work those</i><br>
<i>&gt;things out for ourselves. Some may think they don't know enough about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;organization. Hey, that's what this list is for. Ask some questions, ask</i><br>
Max. <br>
<p>
Yes! Please do ask, and please do comment on what you would like to see ExI<br>
doing (and how we can make it happen with our resources or by expanding our<br>
resources).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I, too, am very careful about my affiliations and their impact on my</i><br>
career. There's<br>
<i>&gt;nothing wrong with that. But, if you're a transhumanist, and you think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism needs to pick up some steam, then a contribution to some</i><br>
<i>&gt;organization seems like a good next step. Some people, like Broderick, are</i><br>
already<br>
<i>&gt;doing their share by themselves, and we need more and more people like</i><br>
that, too.<br>
<i>&gt;Living in the States, and given that I don't have the expertise to write _The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Spike_ or something similar at this point, I think ExI could use my help.</i><br>
<p>
We certainly could use your help. Thanks, Keith for your constructive message.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
