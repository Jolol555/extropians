I'm going to keep this brief, and then I'll probably have said all I feel<br>
like saying on this subject...<br>

Bad example. The Jews were disarmed by law, before they started being<br>
rounded up and exterminated. Kind of like my "all left handed people are<br>
now slaves" example.<br>
<p>
The Warsaw ghetto was defended by a handful of Jews with a pitiful<br>
collection of arms, put up against a very large number of German troops.<br>
They were the exception.<br>

Nope, I don't know anything of the sort. There are something like 40<br>
states with liberalized "shall-issue" laws for concealed carry permits.<br>
There has been no bloodbath.<br>
<p>
I do not promote guns.<br>
<p>
I do promote individual responsibility.<br>
<p>
I teach Eddie Eagle to people who express an interest:<br>
<p>
"Stop. Don't touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult."<br>
<p>
If that kid you mentioned had been taught, instead of being ignorant, the<br>
UN trooper would be alive today.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; that if guns didn't even exist at all there would be a lot less to </i><br>
<i>&gt; have to protect one's self from.</i><br>
<p>
As I say, I used to believe something similar. I still think that if I had<br>
a magic wand that could instantly turn every firearm on the planet into a<br>
puddle of atoms, I *might* wave it. But I'd think long and hard about it.<br>
<p>
Because, as others have said, they're just not that hard to build.<br>
People in the 1400s could do it, for heaven's sake. People with<br>
access to nothing more than a corner hardware store can build them.<br>
<p>
And since they're not going away, why should only bad guys have them?<br>
<p>
Peace, and *I*'m out...<br>
