You say about my post:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In an alternate Universe, you wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; However, if we eliminate individual opinions as the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "objective reality", what logically remains except the opinions of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "something" opinionated thing to create an "objective reality?"</i><br>
<p>
First, I never wrote anything in "alternative Universe." I even reject the<br>
phrase as a contradiction. The only thing I can find that even has a very<br>
vague similarity by a line or two is this:<br>
<p>
{{{{{Nevertheless, when we eliminate human<br>
individual as reference for the concept, morality, what remains<br>
except an expressed or implied superior being; indeed, what<br>
psychological force does the concept, morality, have without<br>
subordinating individual to an "external superior?"}}}}}<br>
<p>
Hardly a match, is it?  As you can see, what you're saying I wrote is quite<br>
a bit removed from my actual statement. There are several instances of this<br>
in your post and its most confusing. Sometimes a whole paragraph is not<br>
mine, and sometimes there appears to be a mix. I have no idea what happened,<br>
but considering the circumstance, I'll just respond to a major point or two. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In literally every claim of "objective value" I have encountered apart from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the formal religion variety which openly claims "God" as "objective value"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cause, the claimant manages to bring in a personal value and pretend that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is objective discovery. Some, like Rand, go to great lengths to "prove" this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; discovery. The "ought from is" fantasy. Others just toss it in without so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; much as a by your leave.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You are incorrect.  Where have I done so?  I have claimed that "objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;value" exists, although not that my values are objective.</i><br>
<p>
What are you calling "objective value?" Please define objective, then value,<br>
then put the two together. I'm really not getting this unless you are<br>
arbitrarily changing the meaning of objective in an oscillating fashion. If<br>
your values are not objective, then they must be subjective, right? Also, if<br>
objective value exist, I presume it its objective by the same criteria that<br>
the law of gravity, etc. are objective. If not, it appears that the term,<br>
objective, is being used non definitively. If so, then objective value is<br>
inherent in objective reality and can't be escaped. So on what do you claim<br>
that objective value exists, but are not your values?  Does your idea of<br>
morality, objective or otherwise incorporate an "ought", as in "ought to<br>
choose a particular end" - as opposed to the objective mandate that one<br>
MUST choose appropriate means if a desired end is to be achieved?  Again, I<br>
request: Please define and elaborate with illustrations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; What of the phrases, "values of society", "public welfare", "national</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interest", "government does", as only four of a horrendously long list of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; concepts that express and\or imply the subordination of individual to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; superior being? Separation of church and state?  Quite a joke.  How does</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "state" exist except by thought and action treating "State" as a volitional,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; valuing, acting, supreme god to which each and every individual is</i><br>
subordinated?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I suggest you read up on the Constitutional Convention.  A state may exist as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a social compact between the rulers and the ruled - the theory the Founding</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fathers(*) started out with.  Or as sovereign power which has its sole source</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the people and is willingly delegated by them into a formal government - a</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept introduced by James Wilson that wound up as the base of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Constitution.  There was a great deal of debate regarding how much power the</i><br>
<i>&gt;United States should have, whether it should be able to overrule the component</i><br>
<i>&gt;States, and even what the fundamental basis of government was.  In our modern</i><br>
<i>&gt;times, government is by thought and action treated like some huge, lumbering</i><br>
<i>&gt;beast.  The attitude you describe is not often seen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Are you telling me that I'm mistaken, that government IS NOT the initiation<br>
of force and coercion? Yes or no? Your comments that posits abstracts as<br>
real things (standard practice) evades the question and proposes to cover<br>
the facts with the usual fare of illusions that have long supported the idea<br>
of government. As for reading about the Constitutional Convention, I did<br>
some time ago, and am quite familiar with the Constitution itself which I do<br>
not hesitate to call a monstrous slave paper. As pertains to suggested<br>
reading, may I suggest "The Principles Of Epistemology" and "The Anatomy Of<br>
Language" as a basis for understanding why and what I label as contradiction<br>
and reject. You might also want to go on to the chapters, "The Illusion Of<br>
Categorical Identity" and "Law And Disorder."<br>

<p>
Contradictions:<br>
<p>
1.&gt;A state may exist as a social compact between the rulers and the ruled - <br>
<p>
Please explain to me a "social compact" between two individuals who agree to<br>
rule and be ruled. An agreement to be ruled is a contradiction in terms is<br>
it not? So, what's really going on, rule or non rule? Is there really any<br>
doubt? The only ones actually being ruled in all this are those who reject<br>
the idea and system. In reality, the relationship between the rulers and the<br>
ruled is one of master and servant; fundamentally, it is the subordination<br>
of one individual to the will of another. As maintaining this relationship<br>
requires initiation of force and\or coercion, instead of being a social<br>
compact, it is an anti social action. That most, programmed to not know any<br>
better, volunteer for the system and seek to direct the centralized<br>
offensive force does not change the character of it, and the certain end<br>
result of resentment, hostility and violent conflict. I'm not saying its<br>
"evil." I'm just saying that if peace and order is the goal, those that try<br>
to gain it by means contrary to ends just don't have any respect for natural<br>
principle and truth. Their privilege, but I do wish they would just leave me<br>
out of it and\or quit pretending that everyone goes along with the suicidal<br>
and destructive idea.<br>
<p>
2. &gt; the theory the Founding Fathers(*) started out with.<br>
<p>
The "Founding Fathers" (and the rest of the gang) did not start with a<br>
social compact, but the will to rule, and did not hesitate to harm any who<br>
resisted.<br>
Do you find anything in the old records or the new that says if an<br>
individual wants no part of the system, said individual is excused and will<br>
not be subjected to any of the offensive laws? I've read a lot of<br>
constitutional and law stuff and have ever seen anything like this.  Have you?<br>
<p>
3.  &gt;Or as sovereign power which has its sole source in the people and is<br>
<i>&gt;willingly delegated by them into a formal government&lt;</i><br>
<p>
"Soverign power"? Soverign power is not a thing. Its an action. Thus the<br>
question: Who has "soverign power" over whom, and how is it really brought<br>
about? Since the term, people, denotes a subjective category existing only<br>
in mind and is not a thing, volitional or otherwise, "people" cannot<br>
delegate anything to anyone. As for  the "willingly", If there were<br>
universal willingness as implied, why did the "Founding Fathers" ( and the<br>
rest of the gang) keep so much fire power around and draw up "laws" to give<br>
themselves permission to use the fire power to persuade the unwilling? The<br>
pretense of all volunteers just won't match the obvious facts.<br>
<p>
4.  &gt;There was a great deal of debate regarding how much power the<br>
<i>&gt;United States should have, whether it should be able to overrule the component</i><br>
<i>&gt;States, and even what the fundamental basis of government was.</i><br>
<p>
This entire statement floats in an abstract circle far far removed from the<br>
reality, human individual.  The "United States" nor "States" are things, so<br>
the power did not exist in these abstracts, but the individuals who manged<br>
to gain, hold, and direct the superior offensive force. Since real<br>
individual was left out of the equation, except as means to "divine end",<br>
the "debates" came down to emotional persuasion via arguments of "divine<br>
cause" and who were the "inspired."<br>
<p>
5.&gt;In our modern<br>
<i>&gt;times, government is by thought and action treated like some huge, lumbering</i><br>
<i>&gt;beast.  </i><br>
<p>
Treated as a thing?  Does the term, government, denote "a thing?" If so,<br>
please show it  to me. If not, is not the contradicion clear?<br>
<p>
6.&gt; The attitude you describe is not often seen.<br>
<p>
Huh? When is it not seen???  Treating "government" as a god, as a superior<br>
being and subordinating individual is the ONLY way the idea can survive and<br>
be implemented. "not often"? How about ALWAYS, both past and present. Take<br>
away the absolute and intolerant power premise of the god called government,<br>
and the whole thing disappears. If ALL individuals are not regarded as<br>
property of this imagined god, government, you tell me how it is sustained.<br>
Can I say, "Go away" and be left alone? Oh no, then anyone would who wanted<br>
to could also. Absolute ownership and absolute intolerance of individualism<br>
are the only premises that sustain any and every governmental system<br>
regardless of label. The term, government, is a direct contradiction of the<br>
term, individualism; and there is no statement more absurd that depicting<br>
government as a superior being  and "protector" of "individual rights."<br>
That which inherently negates cannot "protect" that which it dismisses.<br>
Silly word game. Silly yes, but very deadly. Did you ever notice that when<br>
"countries" go to war. It is individuals that bleed and die. No matter what<br>
the carnage, the sacred idea and "divine abstract" *must* survive. This is<br>
the mindset of billions, and billions have paid the penalty in suffering and<br>
death.<br>
