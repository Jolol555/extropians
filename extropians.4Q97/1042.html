Since I already posted a response to the article in focus on 10\30\97, I<br>
will be brief.<br>

<i>&gt;Study Suggests Brain May Affect Religious Response</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From a Times Staff Writer</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New Oreleans- No one knows why humanity felt its first religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;stirrings,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but researchers at UC San Diego reported Tuesday that the human brain</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard-wired to hear the voice of heaven, in what researchers said was the</i><br>
<i>&gt;first effort to directly address the neural basis of religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;expression.</i><br>

Since literally all of my experiences lead me to conclude that actual<br>
identification of an entity (physical quantity) or a relationship is by<br>
objective differentiation, I must necessarily adhere to this criteria unless<br>
or until someone or something reveals it as error. The article in question<br>
evidences no recognition of such criteria.  There is no definitive<br>
differentiation between scientific and non scientific, nor any<br>
differentiation between religious and non religious, nor any differentiation<br>
of "God" as an objectively identifiable entity; indeed, there looms the<br>
everpresent question: How does one mentally abstract an "infinte god" in<br>
absence of limited quantity, a pre-requisite for identification of a thing?<br>
If one knows something is true, one will also feel that it is true. However,<br>
this does not work in reverse as seems to be a popular notion.<br>
<p>
For further analysis of the alleged "scientific research", see the<br>
aforementioned post of 10\30\97.<br>
