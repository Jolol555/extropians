      Hello, Kathryn,<br>
<p>
      I understand...<br>
<p>
      But here's a contribution I posted to 'Taking Children Seriously' <br>
      recently.  I discussed all this with Graham Able, the present <br>
      Headmaster of Dulwich College, last Friday.  A great -- albeit <br>
      conservative -- friend of mine advised me I could wind up dead if I <br>
      raised this next matter with him.  Actually, it was kinda mellow...<br>
<p>

Hello!  I _like_ TCS!!  I wish we had TCS when I was a kid!!!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      When I was a kid, I wanted to live in America, not least because<br>
kids there could have .22 Colt Woodsman 'plinking' pistols and neat Marlin<br>
lever-action rifles, not the replica .45 Colt Peacemaker cap-firer I had.<br>
(ISTR, I got my 'fast-draw' and fire down to .25 seconds).<br>
<p>
      I had a father who had been asked by the prewar Fascist Party to<br>
stand as a Parliamentary candidate.  He often used to threaten to kill me<br>
-- and he clearly wanted to, sometimes.  When I read this following motto<br>
for the first time, I understood exactly why I _really_ wanted a gun:<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
"God made all people equal, and Smith &amp; Wesson intend to keep it that way."<br>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
      After attending a primary school where I was routinely and viciously<br>
caned on the outstretched fingers of my  left hand, in an ill-conceived<br>
effort to make me right-handed (afterwards, I would be unable to write or<br>
play the piano for days, which was of course their intention), I started<br>
taking an interest in larger-caliber weapons...  People started to die in<br>
oddly coincidental ways around that time. [ I didn't kill them -- <br>
directly, any road ]<br>
<p>
<p>
      I 'won' a scholarship to Dulwich College, where -- as an 11-year-old <br>
-- I was puzzled by the school's insistence on the little kids swinning in <br>
the nude, while masters and prefects 'talent-spotted' from the balcony. <br>
The selected kids would be subjected to ongoing and arbitrary severe <br>
physical punishments until they agreed to provide certain active and <br>
passive -- shall we say? -- services...<br>
<p>
<p>
      By now, I was learning to fire .303 rifles, Bren guns and other toys...<br>
<p>
<p>
      A favourite practice of the prefects was to round up a dozen or so<br>
kids, and subject them one at a time to the following lunch-time ritual:<br>
<p>
      The kids would be told on a Friday that they would attend for<br>
punishment on the following Monday.  This would give the kids all week-end<br>
to dwell on what would happen to them.<br>
<p>
      They would have to line up ouside the School Prefects' Common Room<br>
(the room's still there).  The door would be flung open, and the first<br>
kid's name would be shouted out, and the door closed again.  The kid would<br>
have to ask for admittance, and then march precisely up to a raised dais,<br>
where three prefects sat, with several canes lying on the desk.<br>
<p>
       The kid would be 'accused', and asked to explain himself.  No<br>
explanation was _ever_ good enough, of course.  The interrogations would<br>
be interspersed with canes being whacked down on the top of the desk.<br>
Other prefects werw seated around the sides of the room, many with<br>
newspapers discreetly positioned over their laps...<br>
<p>
       Eventually, when the kid had been suitably terrorized, he would<br>
have to hold his ankles in the middle of the room.  He would then be<br>
cleverly and systematically beaten.  The kids were often very brave, and<br>
would try so hard not to cry.  What they didn't understand was that they<br>
would be beaten until they _did_ cry.  Sometimes all the strokes would be<br>
on the same line; sometimes, in parallel lines.  Clever bastards...<br>
<p>
      Afterwards, the tearful kid would be lectured, then told to leave.<br>
<p>
      Then the next name would be called...  All the kids outside could<br>
hear all this going on, of course.  The sessions could last up to two<br>
hours...  And they could always pick you again for next week's session, if<br>
they felt like it.  (At Stoneyhurst School, a fellow-CIXen I know was<br>
beaten _every day_ for two years...).<br>
<p>
<p>
      I was suspended from Dulwich seven times, and 'asked to leave' twice<br>
(a record), the last time for taking an 11" bladed Bowie knife and a .22<br>
pistol to school (I had a .50 caliber percussion revolver as well).<br>
<p>
'Cet animal est mechant!  Quand on l'attaque, il se defend!' &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
      I went on to Geelong Grammar School in Australia, where as a cadet I<br>
learned to use Browning .50 caliber machineguns, 9mm. submachineguns and<br>
.45 military sidearms, as well as mortars and grenade launchers.  I was<br>
expelled for refusing to be beaten in the showers by the House Prefects,<br>
for calling a prefect an 'impolite bastard.'  I received a standing<br>
ovation when I left, two weeks before my University Entrance exams.<br>
<p>
       One kid hurt me rather up badly one day.  Some weeks later, I<br>
was 'firing-in' a sniper rifle on the range, and this character walked<br>
down the side of the range.  I set the sights, swung the rifle over,<br>
chambered a live round, and lined him up neatly in the sights.  At that<br>
instant, I felt a wonderful sense of healing -- I realized that he now<br>
lived or died with my _permission_, and I didn't have to _hate_ him any<br>
more.  'Empowerment'<br>
<p>
<p>
       The last handgun I owned was a Remington .45 ACP with nickel-plated<br>
slide. Good 'stopper.'  I thought through very carefully all the<br>
consequences of ever using it on someone, and decided not to keep it.  I<br>
must confess to a slight weakness for the magnificent Barrett Light Fifty<br>
Special Forces rifles, which can take out targets in a red-and-white mist<br>
of blood and bone fragments at 1 000 yards, and blow damn great holes<br>
straight through brick and concrete walls.  Clickers and Order details on<br>

      Well, now we have helium-sapphire laser weapons coming, with<br>
two-stage triggers, which first create ionized conductive plasma tracks as<br>
the lasers strike the air molecules.  You then discharge preset<br>
ulracapacitor high-voltages down the plasma tracks.  Rather like Gene<br>
Roddenberry's STAR TREK phasers, eh?  (He wrote and produced the 50's<br>
classic TV series with Richard Boone, 'Have Gun, Will Travel.'  &gt;:-}<br>

      "Have Gun, Will Travel"<br>
       Reads the card of a man;<br>
       A knight without armour<br>
       In a savage land.<br>

       His fast gun for hire<br>
       Needs the calling wind.<br>

      Of course, intelligence officers don't usually carry guns, for<br>
      pragmatic as well as principled reasons.  CIA 'disposed' of the<br>
      Argentine-controlled Somocista core of the Contras by inviting them<br>
      to go off into Nicaragua on morally indefensible missions, along<br>
      infiltration routes very well-known to the Sandinistas.  Think of it<br>
      as 'ecology in action.'  &gt;:-}<br>
