I resend this msg, since I see my own mail in the list as<br>
an empty mail ?<br>
<p>
Also, I recieve your awnsers, before I see my own mail <br>
in the list ?<br>
<p>
----------------------------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Hello all,<br>
<p>
First:- I don't know for sure if I recieved all your mails.<br>
        -The mails from Anders &amp; Kennita are at work, so I can only<br>
          try to recall them<br>
        - The spelling checker is also at work :-)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;As I tried to draw, could we make some "flexible" pipes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that have attached  balls with a light gas. This way the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;structure rises from earth to space. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As Kennita and others have pointed out, it is hard to build such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; structure.  However, even if you could build it, it wouldn't be that</i><br>
useful<br>
<i>&gt; for getting to space.  It is a non-obvious fact that most of the</i><br>
difficulty<br>
<i>&gt; in getting from here to orbit is in acquiring speed, not altitude.</i><br>
<p>
question: if you have altitude (say into orbit), why do you still need<br>
speed ? (I mean, for example, the elevator, screws his way up, does<br>
it need to gain speed ? I thought it could go the whole way with the<br>
same speed)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Attaining orbital velocity of 8 km/sec requires storing 16,000,000 joules</i><br>
<i>&gt; in every kilogram of payload.  On the other hand, reaching an altitude of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 100 km requires only 1,000,000 joules per kilogram.  So climbing to the</i><br>
top<br>
<i>&gt; of a 100 km tower gets you only 6% of the way to orbit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ok.<br>
<p>
But: if you'd had a rocket-platform on the top of this structure,<br>
isn't it easier then to go into orbit ?<br>
Also since, it's space, can't you just build on. Ok, it's a long way<br>
but in space the structure doesn't have a lot of forces to take on.<br>
<p>
Then: can someone tell me from where to where the "winds" are<br>
blowing hard ! ( I mean from X-km to Y-km from earth)<br>
I thought that maybe by making holes into the pipe, more like<br>
a grid, you could save weight and the wind can get trough the<br>
pipe.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm not seeing this right: But isn't it the problem to get<br>
away from the gravity of earth that usses all the energy. <br>
And therefor it's so expensive to go to space ?<br>
My simple idea, is just to get an elevator to space (100 km ?)<br>
This wil give you a road to space, by wich you could ship parts to<br>
this height. Build rockets/sun-sails/etc.. on top and work from there.<br>
<p>
So one problem is: the gas isn't light enhough anymore at some<br>
point in the air ?<br>
<p>
An other, the materials for the pipes ? Does this mean that the forces<br>
from the wind, can rip appart a woven stucture from some very strong<br>
wire ! one available today.<br>
<p>
3rd: the gas balls, can't keep the stucture up. <br>
<p>
If one of you has the time, can you tell me a bit more about, how<br>
big a ball of gas would be needed to keep up a pipe from let's say:<br>
- 4-diameter, and a lenght of 100 meter<br>
- it's a woven structure of a stong wire (available today)<br>
- it's an open structure (because of the wind)<br>
- and it has in it of cause the teeth, were the screw-elevator,<br>
  has to hold on.<br>
- I have no clue, what something like this would weigh :-)<br>
<p>
Anyway, if some of you have the time, and think it's fun,<br>
could "we" (says the one with now scientific knowledge :-)<br>
try to create(virtual) a thing like this. Just to see were the<br>
problems lie, and find some ways to get arround them.<br>
<p>
I know, the cable on to an astroid is probably better.<br>
But my thought-experiment, is more from the ground up !<br>
So: we can't make a cable on to an astroid.<br>
<p>
Anyway: thanks all for the help !<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
