At 02:38 PM 11/24/97 -0800, you wrote:<br>

<p>
My example of someone killing someone else is<br>
similar.  As long as there are no contradictions, I<br>
see no problem with integrating the views.  You<br>
threw the ball, through the medium of your arm.<br>
(The game itself supplies the motive behind you<br>
doing so.  I would not deny ideas -- the rules of<br>
various games being such -- have an effect, but<br>
not in the sense of they exist outside of minds<br>
and directly cause things to change.  But I,<br>
unlike Freeman et al., offer no general theory<br>
on this -- for now.:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the point these people I quoted were trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make is that, while there is always some</i><br>
<i>&gt;object-level causality going on, that may not be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;most effective way to describe or study a situation.</i><br>
<p>
I sign on to that, in some cases.:)  Look, we are going<br>
to far for a book I haven't read.  I am only talking about<br>
the quote I read and your rejoinders to me.  I'd really<br>
have to dig deeper into the argument.  If I get the<br>
time and the dough, I'd like to read Turner's book.<br>
<p>
As long as you limit causality to the kind that many<br>
Moderns denote by the term, then, yes, there is much<br>
beyond causality.  However, there is a wider, more<br>
_realistic_ (to me:) view of it which I subscribe to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I disagree, and note how he [Freeman]has assigned</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;here!  He implies "neural processes" are the cause of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the way we "humanize" the "interrelations of objects</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and events.":)  As usual, those who deny axioms must</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;use the very axioms in the denial.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps he has just been a good eliminative</i><br>
<i>&gt;materialist and pared things down to the 'real'</i><br>
<i>&gt;underlying cause ;-)  But, as in my ball-game</i><br>
<i>&gt;example, there's some circular causality involved in</i><br>
<i>&gt;most complex situations.</i><br>
<p>
My point: Freeman implied in your quote of him that<br>
causality is a human thing -- as if to mean, causality<br>
is a fantasy we impose on reality.  He then went on<br>
to give the causes of this.  That was what was<br>
circular -- i.e., his argument.  Now, if causality is a<br>
chimera, then so is his argument, since he relies on<br>
it.  If not, then his argument is self-defeating, don't<br>
you think?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We don't really know the final causes in most</i><br>
<i>&gt;situations; but, in most situations, one or the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;causes will usually suffice to get us by.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if we are trying to get a better understanding of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"universe that is a totality - an integrated whole"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(as you put it), a relational viewpoint may often</i><br>
<i>&gt;offer a more complete picture than a causal viewpoint</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is practically restricted to a limited set of</i><br>
<i>&gt;objects and their apparent direct impacts on each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other.</i><br>
<p>
Again, that is only one view of causality.  The neo-<br>
Aristotelean/Objectivist view is not of billiard balls,<br>
but of entities having natures and changing<br>
according to their natures.  The reason a billiard<br>
ball moves like it does when hit by another in<br>
your average game, as opposed to what an egg<br>
or a puff of moist air is because of what it is.<br>
