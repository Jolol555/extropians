: 	I don't understand how one can compare one infinite number with<br>
: another (such as an infinite volume of space and an infinite number of<br>
: stars).  If there is an infinite space per star, it seems possible that<br>
: it won't get filled.  One infinite amount does not necessarily equal<br>
: another.  For instance, how big is an infinite amount of space squared?<br>
: Is it bigger than a "regular" infinite amount?<br>
<p>
Imagine an infinite row of identical stars, equally spaced along a<br>
line.  From any point in space, this would look exactly the same as<br>
one star between two infinite parallel mirrors.<br>
<p>
Now imagine an infinite cubic lattice of stars: this is equivalent<br>
to one star in a mirrored cube.  Where's the infinite space for it<br>
to dump its light?<br>
<p>
The cubic lattice is obviously a simplification, but your infinite<br>
homogeneous universe is qualitatively no different.<br>
<p>
There is a way out: Mandelbrot suggests that the distribution of stars<br>
is a fractal dust with dimension less than 3 - which means that the<br>
number of stars within a given radius increases more slowly than the<br>
volume of the sphere.  As you go out, you find ever-bigger empty spaces.<br>
