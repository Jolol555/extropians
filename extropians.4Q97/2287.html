<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 &lt;clip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course not. you fail to understand the economics of energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices. Tell me, when did oil companies make the biggest</i><br>
<i>&gt; profits????? Duh, when prices were sky high during the OPEC</i><br>
<i>&gt; stimulated and Carter induced oil crunch of the 70's and 80's.</i><br>
<p>
I'm no admirer of Carter.  IMHO he's the second-best President of my <br>
lifetime, because he was so incompetent he couldn't get his <br>
horrible ideas implemented -- the best was Reagan because his good <br>
ideas got in the way of Congress's horrible ideas, and in <br>
retaliation Congress didn't approve his horrible ideas either.<br>
<p>
But let's give the, ahem, "credit" where it's due.<br>
<p>
It was primarily NIXON that induced the oil crunch of the 70s.  (And <br>
OPEC was more than happy to take advantage of it.)  It was pretty <br>
much over before Carter came into office.  As far as I can recall <br>
there really was no oil crunch in the 80s.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy taxes take effect, this will increase prices, which will</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase their margins, allowing oil execs to squeeze in more</i><br>
<i>&gt; profits. They also will be able to wangle huge increases in</i><br>
<i>&gt; government subsidies for energy research. Pushing oil shale scams on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the feds was one of the biggest cash cows the oil boys perpetrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the US and Canada.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;be that you are wrong about the solution. The fundamental need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;is to increase the amount of organic matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Trees are stable biomass. It may be that more CO2 'bonding' can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; done by oceanic plankton as was noted by Michael Lorrey. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; these cannot be more than temporary solutions since the global</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; emission of CO2 is increasing exponentialy and will continue to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at least so for some time (there's a lot more coal to burn).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not so. As CO2 levels go up along with heat, and hopefully with some</i><br>
<i>&gt; stimulation from sinking a couple thousand obsolete cargo ships (all</i><br>
<i>&gt; that metal rusting stimulates plankton growth), that plankton will</i><br>
<i>&gt; flourish and become a) fishfood, which will become people food,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which will become sludge spread over the barren wastes of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; midwest, the Sahara, etc. and b) precipitating detritus settling on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ocean bottom, to, over time become methane hydrate deposits. &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;If your solution compels poor &gt;  &gt;people on marginal land to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue the agricultural practices now &gt;  &gt;turning that marginal</i><br>
<i>&gt; land into desert, you are being counter-productive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about throwing out 100 years of counterproductive waste</i><br>
<i>&gt; treatment "technology" and start spreading sludge over the desert???</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are companies doing this now in Texas with New York City</i><br>
<i>&gt; sludge (grade B sludge).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have no idea where you got this idea and of course it's also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; necessary to try to foster sustainable land-use in poor countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is just a part of a much bigger general education problem. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; farmers on the edge of desert can be educated about these things</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that will be a very big plus (just as education about family</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; planning and basic health).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point there is little for Mohammed Q. Sixpack in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sourthern Sahara can do, as the main thing draining usable soil from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the desert's periphery is the sun and the winds. Getting Europe to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ship its shit south would do wonders.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Clinton proposes US businesses should pay out of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;pockets each year to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;dumping dusts of metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;oceans, we might solve the problem not only for the US, but for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;the entire world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I've heard proposals to dump animals waste (a lot of that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Europe, and no-one knows what to do with it) in so-called 'oceanic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deserts'. These are area's in the oceans that do not contain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; minerals (maily nitrogen) required for basic plankton life and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mostly lifeless because of it. The introduction of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nitrogencompounds could start a whole foodchain that would bond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many megatons of carbon. The high cost seems not to be getting it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the middle of an ocean but to get is from the farms to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ships, after that: no problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Except for bureaucracy. The EPA, that fountain of wise and informed</i><br>
<i>&gt; environmental protection, has banned New York from dumping its</i><br>
<i>&gt; sewage at sea. Any wonder that local fisheries have plummeted???</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;The major problem with that claim is that identifiable sources</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;of possible error convert it to something on the order of "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;global temperature is someplace between two degrees colder and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;three degrees warmer than a century ago, with the most likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;value being half a degree warmer."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The statistics are difficult, but if you superimpose temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; data concerning the last 150 years from Vinnikov, Groveman and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sources like CRU and GISS the similaritiest are striking to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the least (and so is the upward-trend). No, there's no certainty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet. I do not think we can afford to wait for absolute, 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; certainty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Almost all of the data, however, are from stations in temperate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; tropical, or equatorial zones. There is very little data from</i><br>
<i>&gt; subpolar and polar regions to give such statistical pools the proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; balance. As a result the stats are merely measuring an increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt; equatorial temperatures, while the decrease in polar temperatures</i><br>
<i>&gt; are swamped to insignificance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;The other problem is that to the extent that we can track WHEN</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;this change occurred, it appears that about 80% of the effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;occurred *before* 80% of the alleged cause.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; X-cuse me? The relation between increased CO2 matches the start of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the industrial revolution and the relative decreasing C14</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; concentration correlated with statistical data on global usage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fossile carbon.</i><br>
<p>
Um... weren't we talking about TEMPERATURE change here?  Last I <br>
heard, they figured that the apparent increase in temperature in the <br>
last 100 years mostly happened in the *first* half of that period.  <br>
But the overwhelming majority of industrial activity (including <br>
fossil fuel usage) occurred in the *second* half of that period.<br>
<p>
It doesn't matter how well you can prove that humans caused an <br>
increase in CO2 levels, if you can't show that said increase actually <br>
caused the effect you are trying to stop.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; There is very little doubt were all this 'new'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; carbon comes from, the extent of it's effect cannot be determined</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet but there are many indications that the consequences for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; global food production (amongst many other things) could be a big</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; That</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; How can we say that? There was a happy ecosystem, yes. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; was not a happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; live near shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;No significant evidence of major change in swamp area as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;result of temperature changes in this range. No significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;evidence of non-trivial shoreline changes. No significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;evidence of changes in flooding patterns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not yet, but that may very well be because there's a delay between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cause and effect (not unusual in large systems).</i><br>
<p>
I'm talking about changes that happened tens of thousands of years <br>
ago to millions of years ago.  If the delay between cause and effect <br>
is so large that we haven't seen the effects by now, we have <br>
*nothing* to worry about (in this regard at least) that derives from <br>
any human activity.<br>
