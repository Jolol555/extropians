As someone who works for a 3D graphics chip manufacturer, I find this<br>
rather surprising; in fact, from what I've read about Trinity it will<br>
*only* work with a 3D accelerator; supposedly there will be no software<br>
rendering included, just OpenGL.<br>
<p>
With all the quality options enabled (i.e. a situation similar to ID's<br>
games) I've seen some demos running fifty times faster with my 3D<br>
accelerator than on a 266MHz Pentium-II. I can't see Intel catching<br>
up in the near future unless they build some 3D capabilities into the<br>
CPU itself.<br>
