<i>&gt;        &gt;Mars also may have so-called "fossil  fuel" deposits similar to         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Earth's oil and natural gas reservoirs. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But of course such fuel is useless without free oxygen, and even as a chemical </i><br>
<i>&gt;feed stock I question its value, especially in an age of Nanotechnology.</i><br>
<p>
It is useful in chemical engines (rocket, IC engines, fuel cells) when combined <br>
with free O2,<br>
which of course has to be liberated first. Chemical energy is a fairly compact <br>
storage system. <br>
More importantly, HCs are more economical (less energy) for standard (current) <br>
chemical processes, as well as for a nanotech feedstock.<br>

<i>&gt;        &gt;It bugs me to see a concept [O'Neill-style colonization] named after      </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;its popularizer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think you're being a little hard on O'Neill, the man did some original work</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;and he asked a very deep question, "Is the surface of a planet the best place  </i><br>
<i>&gt;for an advanced civilization?" His answer was no, and I think he was correct.</i><br>
<p>
It was asked and answered many times before him. He did put the numbers to it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Besides, naming a concept for its popularizer is a tradition, 2  continents  </i><br>
<i>&gt;were named after one.</i><br>
<p>
:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;My reform proposals start with instant and total shutdown of the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Space Shuttle program. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;yes. Yes. YES! The space Shuttle started life as a terrible way to perform a  </i><br>
<i>&gt;dangerous job that nobody wanted done, huge expense and inept management  </i><br>
<i>&gt;did not improve things. Dump the white elephant.</i><br>
<p>
The *operating cost* of one single Shuttle launch is enough to fund an entire<br>
new generation of cheap boosters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;This [solar power satellite stations (SSPS)] has been studied since       </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;the late '60s, it is just now starting to make economic sense. </i><br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt;At one time I was a big booster of SSPS, but now I have doubts they will ever </i><br>
<i>&gt;make economic sense in delivering power to earth, I certainly wouldn't invest </i><br>
<i>&gt;my own money in such a venture. It's possible to transmit power by microwaves </i><br>
<i>&gt;from 22 thousand miles, I'm just skeptical of its practicality  given the </i><br>
<i>&gt;alternatives. </i><br>
<p>
It's iffy, but still a contender. Lower launch costs and ultra lightweight cells<br>
might tip the scales. Another proposal I like is to simply pave the Moon with cells<br>
made from native material. This would need a powerline running part way around<br>
the Moon, to use the cells on the far side during new Moon. My proposal here is<br>
to use a Mass Drivers (or such) to launch and receive masses. The power is <br>
transmitted in the form of kinetic energy.<br>
