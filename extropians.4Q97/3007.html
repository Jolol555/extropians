Agreed, which is why it would be nice to have a model of what is going on<br>
here so that one could use something like computer simulations with a GA<br>
to narrow the search.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		Perhaps different cps should be used for different </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Problem: how do you get them there?</i><br>
<p>
It might be possible that some cps flow into tissue at different rates, in<br>
which case, a cp cocktail might be made which can be administered<br>
in the same way current ones are.<br>
<p>
Also, some tissues/organs might be more important than others here<br>
-- depending on the goal.  If one wants merely to preserve the brain,<br>
then one cp might be better at that and not as good at preserving<br>
the whole body.<br>
<p>
Perhaps a multistage process might be used in which blood is removed<br>
and cps are injected into the tissues rather than through the main<br>
circulatory system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		Perhaps different cps should be used at at different </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sounds like a good idea. </i><br>
<p>
:)  Of course, we run into timing and delivery problems too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		What is its long term optimal working temperature?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Irrelevant, since its only purpose is to limit tissue damage doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspension. Of course, if it caused continuing damage at -170, then it</i><br>

<p>
Just figured I'd bring it up, just in case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 	Design of "home" cryonics kit for use in emergency situations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		(This involves messy legal issues, but the design of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		one might lead to a wider acceptance of cryonics by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 		making it a fait accompli.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A fun idea. I can see before me "The Little Cryonicist" for kids:</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspend your pet (liquid nitrogen not included). Not very likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work, though, since it likely requires medical expertise.</i><br>
<p>
Well, one might make it simpler and work on organisms that are easy to<br>
revive.  Such a kit would not only make for good science fiction, but<br>
also might get more people interested in the movement.<br>
<p>
(Stanislaw Lem's novel _Fiasco_ has cryonic suspension units inside<br>
walkers on Titan, so that if the pilots of the walker wind up in a pinch,<br>
they can suspend themselves.  Early in the novel, there is no way to<br>
revive people, but later on a means develops and one of the<br>
preserved persons is revived.)<br>
