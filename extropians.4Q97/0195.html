<i>&gt; &gt; So how long do you think it will take for your car to become an</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; current dreams (if I had the money) to form a company to network</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; my car to a CD jukebox at home so I can listen to any of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; CDs without having to cart them all around. Ditto for programming</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your VCR from afar... The only real limitation I see is the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of wireless connections. But with companies here in Atlanta offering</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unlimited airtime until Jan 1. and companies in SF like Metricom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; offering unlimited 28.8 speed access for $40/month it seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible. All of this of course is an extension of the idea in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Negroponte's Being Digital book about moving bits not atoms...</i><br>

<i>&gt; I thought CDs used a fairly high bandwidth, on the order of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 44K bytes per second per channel? If so, your radio bandwidth must</i><br>
<i>&gt; get a lot cheaper to support this application. Also, it's supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be illegal to build gear that delivers the raw binary from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; audio CD: only the analog waveform is delivered from your player,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought. This is why you have that silly extra wire connecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; your CD-rom drive to your sound card to play audio CDs. All in all</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are probably better off using a DAT tape to copy the CD.</i><br>
<p>
True, but RealAudio and other compression technologies are getting<br>
good enough nowadays that you can deliver near-CD quality (like<br>
playing a portable CD player through your car's cassette player)<br>
over a 56kbit modem. So just hook up a RA server at your house<br>
and a laptop in your car and you are set. You could even theoretically<br>
make your own wireless network using wireless ethernet transceivers<br>
if you don't travel too far from your house. Voila, free networked<br>
audio. The only challenge is to consumerize it enough to make a<br>
product... Just the idea of being able to ditch your discman and<br>
be able to listen to any of your music anywhere in your city would<br>
catch on quite easily if it was fairly competitively priced.<br>
