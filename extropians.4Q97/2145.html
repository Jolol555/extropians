<p>
"Traditional" (Einstein-Rosen bridges) wormholes do collapse almost<br>
immediately, before anything can traverse them. But Thorne showed that<br>
in principle it is possible to stabilize wormholes by threading them<br>
with negative energy densities (for example from electric fields,<br>
negative matter or the Casimir effect). Later papers have shown that<br>
stable wormholes may be possible, but most involve violations of the<br>
energy conditions (which say there are no negative energy densities;<br>
they are however somewhat doubted) or dynamic wormholes that change<br>
"radius" (some do this so slowly they are traversable).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, I was speaking with a friend a while back, and he brought up</i><br>
<i>&gt;the subject of Kerr (sp?) black holes. It seems that these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;theoretical black holes in which the singularity is larger than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mathematical point, elongated perpendicular to an axis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;rotation. Some physicists seem to think that that this singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be ring-shaped. If so, this would mean that one could follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt;axis of rotation into the very center, supposedly "passing through"</i><br>
<i>&gt;the singularity (which if I am not mistaken would have the properties</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a wormhole/gravity well).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the Kerr-Newman solution to the equations (which is a rotating,<br>
charged hole) has many interesting properties, including a<br>
ring-singularity inside the black hole and the possibility of a<br>
wormhole through it. Unfortunately there seems to be results that<br>
suggests that natural black holes will not work, the wormhole<br>
connection is broken when the hole is formed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it were possible to begin a normal (Schwarzchild) black hole</i><br>
<i>&gt; rotating, would one be able to create such a ring-shaped</i><br>
<i>&gt; singularity?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe. Making a Schwartzschild hole rotate is simple, just throw in<br>
mass with angular momentum. But I'm not sure we can control where the<br>
"wormhole" leads, and it might be very hard to get out of the wormhole<br>
opening if that is another black hole. I think I prefer classic<br>
womholes...<br>
