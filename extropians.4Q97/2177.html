Very probably there will be voxel support in OpenGL soon. First voxelspace<br>
hardware accelerators have become available lately. Though this is<br>
high-end visualization market currently, such technology might eventually<br>
become affordable (of course memory demand for voxel rendering is ... <br>
demanding). <br>

While I know absolutely nothing about investments, Texas Instruments's<br>
next-generation devices look very bright technically. Both their Digital<br>
Light Processing and their VLIW SuperDSP (1 GFlop now) family look<br>
absolutely unique on the market. If only they'd add parallel links to the<br>
'C6x family...<br>
