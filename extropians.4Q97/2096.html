<i>&gt; seems to be slipping further and further into a quagmire of internal</i><br>
<i>&gt; turmoil, and a general myre of postings not even remotely related to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the thematic trajectories of what had</i><br>
<p>
I've been on the list since it's inception and managed it for<br>
sometime. I don't accept the view of a "quagmire of internal turmoil."<br>
The Institute is self has never been been healthier, stronger or more<br>
effective.<br>
<p>
The list only reflects those who are on it and the many roles that it<br>
serves and there are many. There are many easy ways to improve the<br>
list's S/N. Here is one: hire a few Phd's to screen each post and<br>
charge enough for the list to cover that cost.<br>
<p>
Given the clear goal that the list should be effective for the<br>
institute w/out taking resources away from it my previous suggestion<br>
is clearly not a good one. Nor would be in the inverse which would be<br>
to allow anyone to post on any topic.<br>
<p>
Given that some middle ground must be met and that those involved are<br>
smart, well spoken and sometimes aggressive people with differing<br>
views you can see that any changes to the list and the list it self<br>
can bring conflict.<br>
<p>
If there is any Quagmire it's that there isn't a separate list for the<br>
meta discussion of the list and that those who want basic list<br>
resources have no way to avoid the "good fight about the list"<br>
<p>
Yours,<br>
<p>
