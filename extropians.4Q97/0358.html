<i>&gt;What I would call instinctive ends are reserved for unreasoning animals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;infants until they reach the mental maturity to calculate in the abstract.</i><br>
<p>
Are you saying that instincts no longer exist when one reaches mental maturity?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However,  answering your question does not require this differentiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;since all value is attributed by individual mind as opposed to discovered;</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning that ends (value attributed) is still ALWAYS subjective.</i><br>
<p>
Somehow, instincts just don't quite fit into the definition of "subjective."<br>
They exist apart from how we feel about them. To be sure, we can control our<br>
instinctive urges, but we still have them. They seem more like a personal<br>
*is* which our mind perceives as an *ought*.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see your end desire stipulated and implicitly coupled with the wish that</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mr. Crocker attribute  value to the end you name.  What is missing is why he</i><br>
<i>&gt;should do so other than to please you. </i><br>
<p>
To not be in conflict with what is probably his most basic instinctive<br>
value. To please himself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where is recognition of Mr. Crocker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice in the matter? The reality is that Mr. Crocker does have a choice and</i><br>
<i>&gt;to not recognize it, whether it pleases you or not, is not dealing with AS</i><br>
<i>&gt;IS, but denial of AS IS, which is to say, denial of the existent, Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crocker. </i><br>
<p>
His instincts are a part of him, and yet he cannot change them through his<br>
choices, only be in compliance or conflict with them. They are AS IS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is literally what every claim of discovered "objective value"</i><br>
<i>&gt;does. In other words, the concept, objective value, is an illusion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;inherently anti individual.</i><br>
<p>
Instincts are an AS IS part of the individual.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non scientific terms</i><br>
<i>&gt;would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality of a thing or</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation. Having expressed this desire, I remain aware that my end chosen</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not the end desire of most. Consequently, I will continue to deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the real by exposing the fact that ought and should have no connection to</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective reality except as personal preference and subjective declarations.</i><br>
<p>
Are not instincts part of objective reality?<br>
