<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some notes and recommendations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To answer a recurring question: although I am happy for RRE's wonderful</i><br>
<i>&gt;subscribers to send me potential items for the list, I absolutely do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;want any commercial press releases.  I am not opposed to commerce -- just</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other day, after all, I passed along Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt's</i><br>
<i>&gt;advertisement for their contextual design course.  It has simply been my</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience that commercial press releases are invariably useless.  I mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;really, they must be *trying* to make them that way, or else some useful</i><br>
<i>&gt;content would sneak in occasionally.  The truth, more likely, is that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are designed for a completely different purpose than circulation among a</i><br>
<i>&gt;general audience on the Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Marc Rotenberg and I have just edited a book called Technology and Privacy:</i><br>
<i>&gt;The New Landscape (MIT Press, 1997).  It collects chapters by ten authors,</i><br>
<i>&gt;each providing a new conceptual framework for understanding the interactions</i><br>
<i>&gt;among technology, economics, and policy.  One theme is the changing role</i><br>
<i>&gt;of technology: social thought has always associated technology with social</i><br>
<i>&gt;control and surveillance, but new technologies of privacy protection hold</i><br>
<i>&gt;the promise of reversing that association, and the Internet is helping to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create a new public sphere for debate and organizing around privacy issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another theme is the maturation of the traditional data protection model</i><br>
<i>&gt;of privacy policy: this model originated in a sort of lawyer's folk theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;of how computers work, back when computers were large, centralized, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;unnetworked, but the world has changed since then.  The data protection</i><br>
<i>&gt;model isn't obsolete, but it has clearly come time to rethink the issues</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the ground up.  And what's what we've tried to do.  It's a great book,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's cheap, and most of the online bookstores have it on sale.  So check</i><br>
<i>&gt;it out.  I'll send an advertisement to RRE soon; in the meantime, you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;read excerpts from the introduction by following the link from my home page:</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In addition I've put some more of my papers online in the last few weeks, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe you'll find something of interest there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mostly, though, I have a whole lot of recommendations to offer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The most interesting book I've read in years is Michael Allen Gillespie,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nihilism Before Nietzsche, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Building on the observation of Weber and others that much modern thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;is secularized religion, Gillespie argues that an important tradition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy is based on a view of God as thoroughly arbitrary and capricious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the middle ages, the basic problem was how to reconcile reason and</i><br>
<i>&gt;faith, and the basic solution was to derive both from the elaborate order </i><br>
<i>&gt;that God Himself had instituted in the world.  The serial upheavals of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Black Death, the Reformation, and the Thirty Years' War made that approach</i><br>
<i>&gt;considerably less plausible, however.  Philosophers accordingly began</i><br>
<i>&gt;drawing much more on the previously marginal tradition of nominalism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which emphasized the tension between man's reason and God's radical</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom.  This approach can be found in Descartes, who, Gillespie argues,</i><br>
<i>&gt;founds a tradition in which man himself must take over many or all of God's</i><br>
<i>&gt;functions.  Gillespie then traces a downward slide through Fichte, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;romantic movement, the Russian nihilists, Schopenhauer, and many others,</i><br>
<i>&gt;finally down to Nietzsche.  Although I doubt that Gillespie and I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;agree about many things, I think that he is basically right about this. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The basic pattern is widespread; in fact, you can see it clearly in AI</i><br>
<i>&gt;research, which has long opposed the heroic and (in practice) almost futile</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationality of the individual agent to an "uncertain, unpredictable, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;changing environment".  Gillespie is one conservative dude, a product of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the followers of Leo Strauss at the University of Chicago.  His political</i><br>
<i>&gt;polemics sometimes get in the way, for example when he treats people's</i><br>
<i>&gt;enemies as authorities on them, or when he goes whole-hog into guilt-by-</i><br>
<i>&gt;association tactics in recounting the beliefs of the Russian nihilists that</i><br>
<i>&gt;Turgenev wrote about.  Nonetheless, I think that Gillespie's variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt;conservatism will become more important in coming years.  The conservative</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement has much to gain by reactivating an awareness of the theological</i><br>
<i>&gt;sources of modern social and philosophical thought, thereby shifting the</i><br>
<i>&gt;whole of public intellectual discourse back onto religious terrain.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;is why I keep saying that we're returning to the middle ages, and why I</i><br>
<i>&gt;expect the institutional system of the United States to continue its rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt;convergence with that of Iran.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also immensely recommended is David F. Noble, The Religion of Technology:</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention, New York: Knopf, 1997.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Although Noble's politics could not be any more different from Gillespie's,</i><br>
<i>&gt;his thesis is remarkably parallel, to wit, that technology is, and always</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been, primarily a religious enterprise.  It has long been known that</i><br>
<i>&gt;important technologists for a thousand years have also written religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;works, but Noble is just about the first person to go and read them all,</i><br>
<i>&gt;taking them seriously as an integral part of the technological tradition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Indeed, from the beginning of technology with the Benedictine monks down</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the present day, one finds technologists suggesting with remarkable</i><br>
<i>&gt;consistency that technology will cause man to resemble God.  In some</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases this suggestion is part of an overtly elaborated theology; in other</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases the theological ideas have been translated into secular terms, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;with religious language reappearing from time to time as if the author had</i><br>
<i>&gt;discovered the analogy afresh.  NASA, for example, is largely a religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;organization, run by religious people for quite openly admitted religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;purposes.  Babbage and Wiener, likewise, were explicit about the religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature of their work in computing, and (as I suggest in a column coming</i><br>
<i>&gt;out in the November issue of Technology Review) the discourse of cyberspace</i><br>
<i>&gt;is full of classical millenarian themes.  For Noble, all of this is reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;to reject technology.  Of course, the word "technology" can mean a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;different things, so that rejecting technology can amount to a wide variety</i><br>
<i>&gt;of different positions.  In other work, Noble vociferously resists those</i><br>
<i>&gt;false friends who would water down the memory of the Luddites, making their</i><br>
<i>&gt;attitude toward machinery seem fancier than it really was.  My own view is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that technology is capable of taking many different directions, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies embody ideas, and that those ideas are frequently fouled up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Noble's objection to the religion of technology is that it is a religion;</i><br>
<i>&gt;my objection is that it is a lousy religion.  As with Gillespie's genealogy</i><br>
<i>&gt;of nihilism, reactivating an awareness of the religious ideas and practices</i><br>
<i>&gt;that became technology -- that is, recognizing *which* religion technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;is -- shifts the debate about technology onto religious grounds.  Gillespie</i><br>
<i>&gt;wants to undermine poststructuralism and communism, Noble wants to undermine</i><br>
<i>&gt;industrial automation, and they're both right.  This is a serious situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does it mean that we *should* rewind society back to the middle ages?  No,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think so.  Does it mean that we probably *will* rewind society back</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the middle ages?  There I'm not so sure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also highly recommended, though seemingly completely unrelated to theology:</i><br>
<i>&gt;C. Edwin Baker, Giving the audience what it wants, Ohio State Law Journal</i><br>
<i>&gt;58(2), 1997, pages 311-417.  We too often hear the catechism of the market</i><br>
<i>&gt;applied uncritically to information.  The problem is that information works</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite differently from physical commodities such as sandwiches and trucks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Information, in short, is a public good.  This is well-known, but nobody has</i><br>
<i>&gt;catalogued all of its consequences.  Ed Baker is a First Amendment scholar</i><br>
<i>&gt;who couldn't care less about cyberspace.  You may recall my recommendation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of his book about the influence of advertisers on the news.  He tells me</i><br>
<i>&gt;that he wrote this paper because he simply needed a citation for various</i><br>
<i>&gt;observations about the public good nature of information but couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;find one.  The result is an interminable catalog of the amazing economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;pecularities of information.  Unless you've gotten used to all of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;facts, you're simply not in a position to talk about the economic issues</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and therefore the policy issues) associated with information technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While we're reading law reviews, here are a few more useful references:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mark A. Lemley, Antitrust and the Internet standardization problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Connecticut Law Review 28, 1996, pages 1041-1094.  This paper and the next</i><br>
<i>&gt;are required reading now that the Justice Department has moved on Microsoft.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Basically they explain why this is the probably best shot that Justice will</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever have.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;James J. Anton and Dennis A. Yao, Standard-setting consortia, antitrust, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;high-technology industries, Antitrust Law Journal 64, 1995, pages 247-265.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Julie E. Cohen, A right to read anonymously: A closer look at "copyright</i><br>
<i>&gt;management" in cyberspace, Connecticut Law Review 28, 1996, pages 981-1039.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The title says it.  One counterargument against information-as-public-good</i><br>
<i>&gt;arguments like Ed Baker's is that information *is* excludable, meaning that</i><br>
<i>&gt;an information vendor can use "copyright management" technologies to control</i><br>
<i>&gt;who uses it and who doesn't.  This would be great from the point of view of</i><br>
<i>&gt;neoclassical economics, but it would be a catastrophe from the point of view</i><br>
<i>&gt;of privacy if publishers could know just exactly what you read, and when.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Marcel Kahan and Michael Klausner, Path dependence in corporate contracting:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Increasing returns, herd behavior and cognitive biases, Washington University</i><br>
<i>&gt;Law Quarterly 74, 1996, pages 347-366.  Even though this paper doesn't seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;like it's relevant to information technology on the surface, I include it</i><br>
<i>&gt;because it's highly relevant to the idea that privacy can be treated as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;good to be allocated by the market.  The idea is that different companies</i><br>
<i>&gt;can compete in the marketplace on their handling of personal information,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that the market would thereby reveal just how much privacy people really</i><br>
<i>&gt;want, and exactly what they're willing to give up to get it.  This is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;more example of the mechanical application of market language to matters</i><br>
<i>&gt;involving information, and as with all the other examples, serious analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the proposal doesn't begin until we take seriously the particularities of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the market.  If the market doesn't work right then it won't allocate goods</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the right way.  If we think about privacy markets as markets in contract</i><br>
<i>&gt;terms -- privacy, after all, isn't a separate and discrete good, but rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;a set of terms incorporated in the contract governing the sale of some other</i><br>
<i>&gt;good or service -- then we need to understand the properties of markets in</i><br>
<i>&gt;contract terms that relate to the handling of personal information.  Kahan</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Klausner suggest that markets in contract terms exhibit network effects,</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning that market participants benefit from using the same contract terms</i><br>
<i>&gt;that others have used before them.  That means that a firm that wishes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;offer innovative contract terms will have to make a potentially substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment that other firms using more commonplace terms won't have to make.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The result could be to restrict the diversity of terms that are available to</i><br>
<i>&gt;consumers in the marketplace.  Nobody has proven whether this really happens</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- indeed, it is a characteristic of debate in this area that neither the</i><br>
<i>&gt;proponents nor opponents of market mechanisms have the slightest empirical</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence one way or the other.  But the argument is plausible enough that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;shouldn't buy the privacy-market story without considerable investigation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I also recommend ACM's StandardView, a crudely produced but intellectually</i><br>
<i>&gt;serious magazine about standards and standardization.  I have long said that</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards dynamics are the key to understanding the evolution of information</i><br>
<i>&gt;infrastructure, and StandardView provides some concrete detail on the (often</i><br>
<i>&gt;strange) standardization process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
