It comes down to "am I getting $95 worth of value out of the connections I<br>
make and the things I get to put together out of pieces I find each year on<br>
this list?"<br>
<p>
I'd say I got at least that much out of the list this past year.<br>
Unfortunately, I also let myself get sucked into a lot of time-wasting<br>
arguments, so my year on the list comes out as a net loss. I am coming to<br>
be more aware that my attention is the only thing I have of value to me.<br>
<p>
Yes it's expensive, if this is the plan. But _I'll_ gamble a 1-year<br>
membership if the people who stay all plan to make the experience worth<br>
$95/yr to each other. I think of it as a pledge. I'm not being snotty about<br>
the decision I've made to invest. I expect dividends or I'll cut my losses. :)<br>
<p>
YMMV.<br>

Not being a member doesn't mean anything. Being a member means you put some<br>
money where your mouth is.<br>
What's the problem? Honestly?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More interesting is the right to "sponsor one new member".  This implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;either that future membership will be restricted to those spoken for by</i><br>
<i>&gt;members, which is disturbing, or (more likely) that a current member</i><br>
<i>&gt;gets to bring in one new one for free.  Perhaps people will be more</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to spring for that than paying lower fees and sponsoring their</i><br>
<i>&gt;friends directly.  To me, it seems odd.  And expensive.</i><br>
<p>
It's a possible alternative (and I don't know what I think of it yet).<br>
Subscription is simple, any complication starts to grow nonlinearly.<br>
<p>
<p>
...<br>
<i>&gt;Not to mention the person who was happy to buy things from ExI, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't want to join, because he didn't join institutions.</i><br>
<p>
Well, ExI isn't the only game in town. There is a lot of transhuman doing<br>
to be done. Excelsior!<br>
