You could make huge amounts of money out of Linux, but it would take<br>
_innovation_ so I wouldn't expect to see the software industry doing it<br>
anytime soon.  Make your technology open, your software free and sell your<br>
hardware at a loss - the more people you get on the network, the more porn<br>
you can sell.<br>

Making applications in Java??  Not likely.<br>

<p>
They're all whiners.  The whole lot of them, except that nice Mr.Gates.<br>
<p>
Maybe the reason he doesn't take cryonics seriously is because of its public<br>
image.  Can you imagine what the press would say if Bill Gates said he was an<br>
immortalist?  For all we know, he could be an closet extropian just waiting<br>
to donate money ;)<br>
