I was in the midst just now of reading "The Media Equation", a<br>
book describing how people treat media socially as if it were<br>
another person, when I came to a chapter describing praise.<br>
<p>
Humans seem to be hard-wired in how they deal with praise and<br>
other social behaviors; for instance, people care much more<br>
about praise from other people than they do from self-praise.<br>
Reading that, it struck me just how illogical that is- I<br>
am generally the best judge of myself and my abilities (as<br>
long as I'm honest :-), and therefore praise from myself<br>
should be "worth the most".<br>
<p>
I'm wondering if it is possible for regular humans such as<br>
ourselves to transcend these stupid genetic behaviors and<br>
live more logical lives? Can it be done by strict self-<br>
monitoring, or are there limits to how far we can progress?<br>
Any books written on this subject?<br>
