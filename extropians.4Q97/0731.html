<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<i>&gt;Second thing...since the theft is an accomplished fact...then it ok as long</i><br>
<p>

<p>
<i>&gt; Your money or your life?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"When does theft become property?"  Is a touchy issue.<br>
<p>
If the Federal government doesn't "really" own something because they<br>
<p>
stole it decades ago, what's to stop a member of a racial minority from<br>
<p>
claiming that I don't "really" own my car, because it was bought with<br>
<p>
money from my job, which I obtained partially thanks to my education, which<br>
<p>
I obtained partially due to my priviledged upbringing and parent's income,<br>
<p>
which priviledge was partially due to race, because white people have<br>
<p>
several economic and social advantages over other races in this country,<br>
<p>
because our ancestors committed theft, forced slavery, and several other<br>
<p>
crimes?<br>
<p>
<p>
While ingenuity, hard work, etc., contribute to ownership, isn't there<br>
<p>
always also a correlation with one-time theft, albeit sometimes abstracted by<br>
<p>
quite a few layers?<br>
