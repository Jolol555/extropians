<i>&gt;The most recent non resident whipping boy, Arthur C. Clarke, was a big</i><br>
<i>&gt;proponent of air cushion vehicles, forecasting their replacement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;automobiles within 50 years (date of original projection: sometime in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the 50's). Of course this never happened, partly because they are: a) so</i><br>
<i>&gt;noisy b)so energy hungry and c) being frictionless meant that poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;maneuveribility in the event of uneven terrain or wind made them</i><br>
<i>&gt;unusable as a major transport form. Me thinks that for all purpose daily</i><br>
<i>&gt;transportation, anti gravity will not become feasible, except possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt;for mass transportation. Traffic is bad enough, imagine millions of cars</i><br>
<i>&gt;careening about like discs on an air hockey board.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any feasible anti gravity technology would be most useful in aircraft</i><br>
<i>&gt;and spacecraft. Now, replacing cars with personal antigravity propelled</i><br>
<i>&gt;aircraft is somehting else entirely. With smart navigation technologies,</i><br>
<i>&gt;using all of that volume in the air is a much smarter way to go about</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. Of course, if there is an accident, expect to die, unless airbag</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology is heavily used, in a manner like the Mars Pathfinder landing</i><br>
<i>&gt;method. Bounce, bounce, bounce...</i><br>
<p>
I'm very interested in anti-gravity technology which repels mass to achieve<br>
lift. If two AG vehicles neared each other, wouldn't their two fields repel<br>
away like opposing magnets? And without sounding too Star Trek, would it be<br>
possible to have an inverse field on the inside neutralizing inertia so<br>
that you'd never get tossed about... I imagine it being like a video game.<br>
You'd be still inside the vehicle, but the whole time your experience would<br>
be unaturally stable. Perhaps that would allow us to be better, safer<br>
piolets. Now, I have no idea what kind of power supply would be needed to<br>
energize such a device.. but it is certainly fun to dream about it.<br>
<p>
Another interesting point of interest to me is oraganic life. If you are<br>
traveling near the ground and a dog, squirl, insect or other life form gets<br>
underneath your field, does it get crushed? Perhaps the vehicle could have<br>
a sensor which would bend the field around animals. Gosh, a portable<br>
version of this field generator would make an impressive anti-attack shield<br>
for handicaped or those unable to protect themselves in dangerous<br>
situations?<br>
<p>
The mind reels.<br>
<p>
I'm still interested in anyones opinions on anti-gravity. Has anyone seen<br>
the CNN report on the Finish super-conductor researches who claim to have<br>
generated a gravitational anomoly? Someone told me that they were<br>
suspending a live chick in the field.<br>
