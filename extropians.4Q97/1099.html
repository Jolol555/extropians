<i>&gt;  &gt;While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Guns? Real or otherwise? Haven't seen those. What's the FTC, some US</i><br>
<i>&gt; Federal agency?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I'm using "guns" here metonymously for "government"; the FTC is<br>
the US Federal Trade Commission--the agency responsible for preventing<br>
free trade in our fair country.  The Department of Justic (DOJ) is<br>
also looking at Microsoft for the hideous crime of freely negotiating<br>
contracts with PC-makers.  We have to put a stop to that, of course.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;will do everything in its power to keep it in power. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Was is not the US governement that broke up the monopoly of Standard Oil,</i><br>
<i>&gt; thus ending a monopoly that consumers and the competition could not break?</i><br>
<p>
No, it was not, though most American history books will tell you that.<br>
When the US passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Standard's market share<br>
was less than 60% and /falling/, having once been 90%.  This happened<br>
because of agile competitors, not guns.  Don't confuse the politician's<br>
excuse for a law with the actual results of a law.  The former is what<br>
gets written in hitory books, but the latter is what really counts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents</i><br>
<i>&gt; for solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.</i><br>
<p>
Patents are government-enforced monopolies, not free-market ones.<br>
