<i>&gt; Re: pollution: Yes, and sort of, and no. Depends on what you mean by</i><br>
<i>&gt; pollution. Less airborne nitrox compounds, sure. But the carbon and</i><br>
<i>&gt; trace elements in the fuel have to go somewhere. And catalyst bed</i><br>
<i>&gt; contamination remains a serious problem. Further, as I mentioned before,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many "hydrogen economy" plans just move the pollution around, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; _increasing_ the sum. Examples: farmed-methanol, central-site</i><br>
<i>&gt; electrolysis with hydride storage, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't the central-site plan's polution impact depend on how you get the<br>
electricity to power the electrolysis?  Wouldn't certain solar (or even<br>
nuclear fission) options net a lower total sum of polution?  Or are you<br>
talking about the extra metals and chemicals that are needed to manufacture<br>
photovoltaics and storage devices?  If so, is this a study or just a guess?<br>
I am under the impression that hydrogen gas could be distributed on the same<br>
kinds of pipelines in use for natural gas today.  I  also have read that<br>
hydrogen has an energy density 3 times that of gasolene, by mass (not by<br>
normal volume, of course).  Good enough that a strong liquid hydrogen tank<br>
could give you gasolene-like range (even given internal combustion<br>
efficiency) while venting less than 10% of its hydrogen storage per day to<br>
keep the contents cool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, hypothetical complex-organic fuel cell catalysts (verging on</i><br>
<i>&gt; enzymes in complexity) *might* solve these  problems. I devoutly wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; for them. But evidence of their actual commercial-quantity appearance</i><br>
<i>&gt; remains sketchy at the present time--even though I built a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bacteria-powered fuel cell twenty years ago. IMHO, bulk nano is the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely way to produce such--by which time _everything else changes too_.</i><br>
<p>
What is the differences/advantages between engineered bacteria and "bulk<br>
nano?"  Also, could you tell us more about the bacteria-powered fuel cell?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; AFAIK, all published fuel cell chemistries that use hydrocarbons</i><br>
<i>&gt; function in exactly the way I describe, by reforming the fuel at point</i><br>
<i>&gt; of use: the fuel cell. Methanol is expensive for reasons mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; previously. The issue isn't purely one of how efficent the _fuel cell_</i><br>
<i>&gt; is; it's a _systems_ concern.</i><br>
<p>
If we are going to have fossil-fuels at the point-of-use, then we might as<br>
well use internal combustion and pre-heated catalytic converters, like Honda<br>
is going to put on some 1999 models.  These are actually better than<br>
zero-emission because in most urban areas the air that goes in will be<br>
"dirtier" than the air going out, even at start up... government definitions<br>
of "zero emmisions" be damned.  Another doable option is to have small gas<br>
turbines running at a constant efficient speed and fuel/air ratio.  This<br>
on-board turbine would charge batteries for a practical electric car.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People are prepared to fight over lots of things.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I am prepared to fight, connive, tinker so I can keep driving a fast<br>
car with good range.  I'm afraid of what alarmists/environmentalists are<br>
doing in the name of dirty air that just isn't that bad.  The air has been a<br>
thorny problem for libertarians like me.  I have to admit my '83 Rx-7  is<br>
probably one of the dirty 10%.  But it really isn't a big deal.  Since we<br>
live in a community that puts politics above property rights it is tough to<br>
see who's air is who's, so I think people should live and let live on this<br>
issue unless things are just absolutly intollerable.  The question will soon<br>
be moot anyway; you can fart and roll down your window and do more damage<br>
than the new car you are driving.<br>
