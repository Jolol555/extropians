<i>&gt;  My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews,  I decided to start my</i><br>
<i>&gt; own business.  In short order, however, I encountered many unforseen</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial problems.  I owed my family, friends, and creditors over</i><br>
<i>&gt; $35,000.  The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't seem to make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow</i><br>
<i>&gt; against my home to support my family and struggling business.  I truly</i><br>
<i>&gt; believed it was wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT</i><br>
<i>&gt; something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience in hopes that this will change your life</i><br>
<i>&gt; FOREVER....FINANCIALLY!!!        In mid December, I received this</i><br>
<i>&gt; program via e-mail.  Six months prior to receiving this program I had</i><br>
<i>&gt; been sending away for information on various business opportunities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective.  They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked</i><br>
<i>&gt; or not.  One claimed I'd make a million dollars in one year...it</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.        But like I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was saying, in December of '92 I received this program.  I didn't send</i><br>
<i>&gt; for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK</i><br>
<i>&gt; GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start,</i><br>
<i>&gt; without putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and paper</i><br>
<i>&gt; and figured it out, I saw I would at least get my money back. After</i><br>
<i>&gt; determining that the program is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I asked</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself "WHY NOT?" and decided to do it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails.  It only cost me about</i><br>
<i>&gt; $15.00 for my time on-line.  The great thing about e-mail is that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't need any money for printing to send out the program, only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost to fulfill my orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "cheat"</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone, no matter how much money it cost me!.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT #1. By January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When you read the GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF</i><br>
<i>&gt; YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;         My first step in making $200,000 in 6 months was done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; By January 30th, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go</i><br>
<i>&gt; back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT</i><br>
<i>&gt; #2 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; DO.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE</i><br>
<i>&gt; YOUR</i><br>
<i>&gt; GOAL."  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, more than I needed.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt; I sat back and relaxed.  By March 19th, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; received $58,000 with more coming in every day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR</i><br>
<i>&gt; LIFE FOREVER! Remember,  it won't work  if you don't try it.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rules of not trying to place your name in a different place.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't work, you'll lose out on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2</i><br>
<i>&gt; explains this.  Always follow the guarantee, 20 orders minimum for</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for REPORT #2 and you will make</i><br>
<i>&gt; $200,000 or more in 6 months.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you do choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on</i><br>
<i>&gt; your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; business, consider this a sign.  I DID!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; PS.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like</i><br>
<i>&gt;         piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "THREW IT AWAY"</i><br>
<i>&gt;         "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but later wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; had no idea who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; e-mailed another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; came.  I DIDN'T throw this one away.  I made $41,000 on the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; try."</i><br>

<i>&gt; "NO FREE LUNCH"</i><br>
<i>&gt;         "My late father always told me, "Remember, Alan, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; free lunch in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Through trial and error and a somewhat slow, frustrating start, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; finally figured it out. The program works very well, I just had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find the right target group of people to e-mail it to.  So far this</i><br>
<i>&gt; year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.  I know my dad</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have been very proud of me."</i><br>

<i>&gt; ********************************************************************</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; program,  and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an</i><br>
<i>&gt; amateur.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business</i><br>
<i>&gt; for ten years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out.  It wasn't me; it was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that</i><br>
<i>&gt; had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; before.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR</i><br>
<i>&gt; GET POORER."  The traditional methods of making money will never allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to "move up" or "get rich"; inflation will see to that. You have</i><br>
<i>&gt; just received information that can give you financial freedom for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagined.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; already made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; program after sending out over 16,000 programs.  Now I have several</i><br>
<i>&gt; offices which market this and several other programs here in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; and overseas.  By the Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; partnership with AMERICA ONLINE.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any</i><br>
<i>&gt; way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be on every one of them!.  Remember though, the more you send</i><br>
<i>&gt; out, the more potential customers you will reach.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "THINK ABOUT IT"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did,</i><br>
<i>&gt; take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil</i><br>
<i>&gt; and figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will</i><br>
<i>&gt; still make a lot of money!  Definitely you will get back what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; invested.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come</i><br>
<i>&gt; in.  IT WORKS!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                         Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a</i><br>
<i>&gt; good list the response would be much better.  Also many people will</i><br>
<i>&gt; send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With</i><br>
<i>&gt; a .5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 200,000.  The .5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; .5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; five dollar bills for you. CASH!!!!  Your total income in this example</i><br>
<i>&gt; is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!</i><br>
<i>&gt; DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE</i><br>
<i>&gt; OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many people will do that and more!  By the way, your cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt; participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already</i><br>
<i>&gt; have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  REPORT#3 will show</i><br>
<i>&gt; you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best</i><br>
<i>&gt; of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been</i><br>
<i>&gt; waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your</i><br>
<i>&gt; dream will come true.  This multi-level e-mail order marketing program</i><br>
<i>&gt; works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.  E-mail is the sales tool of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future.  Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of</i><br>
<i>&gt; advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the more people will be doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; business using e-mail.  Get your piece of this action!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford</i><br>
<i>&gt; Research and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 65% of all goods and services will be sold throughout Multi-level</i><br>
<i>&gt; Methods by the mid to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made</i><br>
<i>&gt; their fortune in the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics</i><br>
<i>&gt; show 45 people become millionaires EVERY DAY through Multi-Level</i><br>
<i>&gt; Marketing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity.  Basically, this is what we do:  As with all</i><br>
<i>&gt; multi-level business, we build our business by recruiting new</i><br>
<i>&gt; partners and selling our products.  Every state in the USA allows you</i><br>
<i>&gt; to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product</i><br>
<i>&gt; for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling.  You do it</i><br>
<i>&gt; privately in your own home, store or office.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is how to work the program:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Do this by ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  names listed on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5</i><br>
<i>&gt;   CASH and a SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS</i><br>
<i>&gt;   SIZE #10) to the person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   International orders should also include $1 extra instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of postage.  It is essential that you specify the NAME and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  NUMBER of the report requested to the person you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS because</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you will be REPRINTING and RE-SELLING them. DO NOT alter</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the names or sequence beyond doing what the instructions say.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           NOTE: Write your request on an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and wrap the cash in that BEFORE you put it in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   envelope. This helps to ensure the mail gets through!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with</i><br>
<i>&gt;            yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,</i><br>
<i>&gt;            moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and</i><br>
<i>&gt;            address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list</i><br>
<i>&gt;            and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    When doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING</i><br>
<i>&gt;   PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it</i><br>
<i>&gt;            as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with whatever e-mail program you like.  Again, REPORT #3</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  acquiring e-mail lists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Step (4)   E-mail a copy of the entire program (all of this is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;            important) to everyone whose address you can get your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hands on. Start with friends and relatives since you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  encourage them to take  advantage of this fabulous money-making</i><br>
<i>&gt;            opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  more than ever.  Then, e-mail to anyone and everyone!  Use</i><br>
<i>&gt;  your  imagination!  You can get e-mail addresses from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  companies on  the Internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  These are very cheap: 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; always request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase</i><br>
<i>&gt; these lists when you order the four (4) REPORTS.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; REQUIRED REPORTS</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE AND $5 CASH FOR</i><br>
<i>&gt; EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER</i><br>

<i>&gt; program. You, too, will be making money within six months, if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; follow the SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into</i><br>
<i>&gt; investments, retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt; money hold you back.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         However, very few people reach financial independence</i><br>
<i>&gt; because, when opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; much easier  to say "NO" than "YES," and this is the question that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; must answer for yourself.   Will YOU ignore this amazing opportunity</i><br>
<i>&gt; or will you take advantage of it? If you do nothing, you have indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; missed something valuable, and nothing will change.  Please re-read</i><br>
<i>&gt; this material; this is a special opportunity. If you have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; information.  You will get a prompt and informative reply.        My</i><br>
<i>&gt; method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs me pennies to produce and e-mail.  I should also point out</i><br>
<i>&gt; again, that this program is legal and everyone who participates WILL</i><br>
<i>&gt; make money. This is not a chain letter or pyramid scheme.  At times</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have probably received chain letters, asking you to send money, on</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the</i><br>
<i>&gt; chain makes them quite unattractive.        You are offering a</i><br>
<i>&gt; legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase the product</i><br>
<i>&gt; from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free</i><br>
<i>&gt; enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a series of four (4) FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information</i><br>
<i>&gt; contained in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your</i><br>
<i>&gt; participation in this program more rewarding, but will be useful to</i><br>
<i>&gt; you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no</i><br>
<i>&gt; way that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box</i><br>
<i>&gt; crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten</i><br>
<i>&gt; years of my life before."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; TIPS FOR SUCCESS</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Send for your four (4) REPORTS immediately so you will have them when</i><br>
<i>&gt; the orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST</i><br>
<i>&gt; send out the product/service to comply with U.S. Postal and Lottery</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws.  Title 18 Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A</i><br>
<i>&gt; PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;   desire.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.      Get a post office box (preferred).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must</i><br>
<i>&gt;  remember,  your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  others  all move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.      Obtain as many e-mail addresses as possible to send until</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT</i><br>
<i>&gt;  #3.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money</i><br>
<i>&gt;          you will make.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 7.      Copy the FOUR (4) REPORTS so you are able to send them out</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE</i><br>
<i>&gt;          SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; *******************************************************************</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; YOUR GUARANTEE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you</i><br>
<i>&gt; must receive 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; within two weeks, e-mail out more programs until you do.  Then a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT #2, if you don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep</i><br>
<i>&gt; breath) you can sit back and  relax,  because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO MAKE</i><br>
<i>&gt;  AT  LEAST  $50,000. Mathematically  it  is  a  proven guarantee.   Of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those  who  have participated in the program and reached the above</i><br>
<i>&gt; GUARANTEES, ALL have reached their goal.  Also, remember, every time</i><br>
<i>&gt; your name is moved down the list, you are in front of a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; REPORT, so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are ordering from you. IT'S THAT EASY; REALLY, IT IS!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; REMEMBER:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "HE WHO DARES NOTHING, NEED NOT HOPE FOR ANYTHING."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "INVEST A LITTLE TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY NOW OR SEARCH FOR IT</i><br>
<i>&gt;         .................FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."</i><br>
