You forgot that the ancient Egyptians also had the linear motor (they've been<br>
found in burial crypts next to the storage batteries that powered them)<br>
millennia ago, and that UFO abductees have reported that Grays have used them<br>
in hideous chromozone-bending experiments deep in the caverns reached by the<br>
USS nuclear sub Nautilus in 1958 when it supposedly "reached the North Pole"<br>
(ha!). This means that Grays probably gave the tech to the Atlanteans in the<br>
first place.<br>
<p>
Go ahead and mock, you talk about too much boring stuff anyway.<br>
It's all true, I read it somewhere and why would they lie?<br>
