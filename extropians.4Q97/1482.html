<i>        &gt;to define its value. Infinity does not. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Infinity may not have a limit but it does have a precise meaning. Remove one <br>
element from set A and make a new set B, if you can find a one to one <br>
correspondence between A and B then set A has an infinite number of elements. <br>
In no place does this say that all numbers that poses this property must be  <br>
equal, and in fact we know that they are not.                         <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Does it really make sense to say that all infinities are not equal? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes because it also has a precise definition, if 2 infinities can be put in <br>
a one to one correspondence with each other then they are equal, if they can <br>
not then one is larger than the other.  It's really not a matter of dispute,  <br>
some infinities can be put in such a correspondence and some can not.<br>

<p>
<p>
Things would certainly be simpler, and more boring, if we could do that, but  <br>
we can't because it's not true.<br>

<i>        &gt;Suppose there are the same number of decimals in [0, 1]  and [0, 2].  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are. The number of decimals from [0,1] is equal to the number from  <br>
[0,2] or [0,99999].<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We should be able to subtract the number of decimals in [0, 1] from         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the number of decimals in [0, 2].  If all infinities are equal, then         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;these represent the same number, and the answer should be zero.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If A is an infinite number then A -A = A not zero, A+A = A too, and A*A =A,  <br>
but 2^A is not equal to A, it's a higher infinity.<br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;have an equal number of points.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It seems obvious that because we admitted that the longer line *was*         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;shorter line, there will be points on the longer line in between the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;lines you drew across.               </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, any fool can see that the longer line must have more points in it than  <br>
the shorter line, but if you can find a one to one correspondence between all <br>
the points in the short line and all the points in the long line, and in my <br>
last post I showed how to do it, then the fool must be wrong. The reason <br>
trans-finite mathematics is so important is that it teaches us that something<br>
can be blindingly obvious and also completely untrue.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;we've used all the integers but there are still points remaining,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;so there must be more points on a line than integers.             </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But doesn't this apply to the odd number example above? </i><br>
        <br>
        <br>
No. I showed how to match up every integer with an odd integer, you can't  <br>
show me any integer that doesn't have a odd mate, so the number of all <br>
integers and the number of odd integers must be the same. In my other example <br>
even after using all the integers I could still find a point on the line that <br>
did not have an integer mate, so there must be more points than integers.<br>
                  <br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;If we use what appears to be this same logic, since we have used all </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of the integers, by pairing them up with only half of the *same* </i><br>
<i>        &gt;integers, it follows that the infinity of the integers is equal to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;half of itself. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, if A is the number of integers then A/2 = A<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Therefore the whole argument must be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
