	Viruses have no "purpose." They exist to replicate, period.<br>
Whatever they do to the host is either a side effect or used as a<br>
replicative advantage. (You sneeze, friend gets sick) <br>

<p>
	A sign of evolution, yes.  A sign of some higher "balance and<br>
harmony of nature" that you keep eluding to, probably not.<br>
<p>

<p>
<i>&gt; why.  There are laws to life and balances.  If we don't abide by them, something's bound</i><br>
<i>&gt; to happen.  We keep progressing, and searching for new technology, but to what end? And</i><br>
<p>
	Please 1) List some or all of these "laws to life" (as I am sure<br>
the Santa Fe Institute would love to know them) and 2) the basis for your<br>
belief in them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; for them.  They are content, they take what they need, and give back.  They follow the</i><br>
<i>&gt; balance.  Now if they can survive in peace with nature for that long, it's damn amazing</i><br>
<i>&gt; feat.  And when we come and wipe them out with our guns, to take their land and</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources for our expanding population it's actually quite sickening.  That system of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living, all that knowledge, down the drain.</i><br>
<p>
	Though your rant reeks of the "Beautiful People Myth," I won't<br>
mention much about that, as I am only vaguely familiar with it, but enough<br>
to avoid believing in it.<br>
<p>
	Next, their survival is not an "amazing feat." Those cultures that<br>
couldn't sustain themselves died out.  Natural selection filtered out the<br>
rest, and we're left with those that work... a few primitive cultures, and<br>
a lot of more advanced ones.  Personally, I'd rather be in the latter<br>
category when it comes to matters of healthcare.  <br>
<p>
	Lastly, read the Extropian principles.  Wiping out other cultures<br>
with guns (or anything else... why are guns always mentioned?) is not<br>
condoned or advocated. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Heh, well as you can see I'm totally of the subject now, but I'm into this, screw</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns, I have my opinions you have yours.  But now I'd like to hear your opinion on some</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the things I've just stated.  It'd be interesting.  Later.</i><br>
<p>
	My opinion: "Screw the Luddite-meme."<br>
