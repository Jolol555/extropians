<i>&gt; Anders? Any other neurologist in the house? How realistic is this?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't been able to access the article, but I think there is reason<br>
for optimism. We are learning a lot about how neurons differentiate<br>
into their functions, and how different substances make them seek out<br>
the right places to connect. Implanting neurons to restore function is<br>
becoming more and more feasible. The problem is to get back to<br>
normal function, and what kinds of implanted neurons work best. But<br>
at least the second is likely solvable in the near future.<br>

<i>&gt; My mother is suffering from Parkinsons disease (diagnosed in '84) and 8</i><br>

<i>&gt; disfunctional braincells are killed to keep some of the wordt symptoms at</i><br>
<i>&gt; bay (trembling, swaying with arms and legs, variations in body</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature). Thing are a *lot* better now but it's no cure, we're just</i><br>
<i>&gt; fighting symptoms.</i><br>
<p>
I'm happy to hear that your mother is better. Parkinsons disease is<br>
basically an imbalance between the movement-activating basal ganglia<br>
and the movement-inhibiting basal ganglia. Pallidotomy restores some<br>
of the balance, but to be honest I think it is slightly<br>
inelegant. That is why I would really like if we could develop the<br>
capability to implant cells that replace the lost substantia nigra<br>
cells.<br>
