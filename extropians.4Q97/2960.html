Well, since I've been a subscriber to this list for 1.5 years now, and<br>
the &gt;H list for a year or more before that, I would expect that there is<br>
enough of my writing on the list for people to see what I was getting<br>
at. The solution that Kathryn  &amp; Comapany would like will take nothing<br>
more than a totalitarian regieme that would make the communist and Nazi<br>
regiemes look like naughty cubscouts. The solution that I propose is<br>
that people acknowledge that violence is enough of a genetic thing that<br>
we will never be able to wipe it out and remain expansive, extropic<br>
creatures. Given this acknowledgement of truth, individuals should<br>
accept the responsibility to a)defend themselves, their property and<br>
their loved ones in a way that minimizes risks to themselves and their<br>
selfsame loved ones, b) work to reduce or change their own actions that<br>
could incite or lead to violent action by others.<br>
