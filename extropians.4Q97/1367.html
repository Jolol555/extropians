Not at all.  Alcor Foundation's annual CryoFeast is a welcoming event for<br>
Alcor members, cryonicists and those interested in simply enjoying the<br>
festivities.  In a traditional sense, this time of year has been to<br>
celebrate Thanksgiving.  In that meaning, it is a festive time to bring and<br>
share foods to eat, exchange ideas for thought, and swap ideas, and share in<br>
the jubilee and rousing cheers of what Alcor Foundation represents in the<br>
community of indefinite life spans (immortality).<br>
<p>
There will be a number of locations for Co-Hosts of this year's CryoFeast --<br>
a first time to spread the joy and invite other Alcor members to Co-Host<br>
parties in their own vicinities.  The Host is Los Angeles, with Co-Hosts<br>
Boston and the Bay Area, for a few.  Each CryoFeast party will be unique.<br>
The Bay Area's party sounds like a lot of fun, especially for turkey eaters!<br>
Boston should be a blast and a lot of really heady folks.<br>
<p>
 Los Angele's will delight in a variety of delectable dishes with a  focus<br>
on guest appearances from authors (for book signings), a virtual appearance<br>
of Vinor Vinge!, and footage of "Future Fantastic," and our special hosts<br>
Fred and Linda Chamberlain of Alcor Foundation.<br>
<p>
Alcor is the largest cryonics organization, and responsible for innovative<br>
work in the field of cryonic preservation and research.  Members such as<br>
Ralph Merkle and Eric Drexler have made great contributions for our possible<br>
revival to life.  Other creative cryonicists such as Fred and Linda<br>
Chamberlain, Mike Perry and Tanya Jones have worked hard over the years<br>
advancing and refining Alcor's development.<br>
<p>
In keeping with the tradition of Thanksgiving but giving it a futuristic<br>
spin, the CryoFeast makes for a good party.<br>
