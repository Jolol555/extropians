<i>&gt; &gt;Thanks Damien. SOunds like another case of the famous Maya fraud of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;30's, where socialist/communist sympathizing archaeologists from British</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and American Ivy League schools developed the preposterous and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;completely unsupported, and eventually debunked theories that the Maya</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;civilization was a socialist paradise of peaceful, communistic, unarmed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;innocent heathens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As it turns out, nothing could have been further from the truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Following a successful harvest, the preist/god/king typically had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ceremony in which he sought the advice of the gods/ancestors, etc. by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;piercing his penis with a series of sharpened splinters from different</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;trees. The pattern of splattered blood that formed supposedly told him</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;what the gods wanted, or that the hallucinogenic state the preist was in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;gave him the illusion he was talking to the gods. In any event, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;message almost invariably was this: GO TO WAR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is also the famous case of Margaret Mead more or less making up a</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole load of shit that influenced (especially leftist) sociology for</i><br>
<i>&gt; years in her book "Coming of Age in Samoa".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; She painted a picture of Samoans as Noble Savages, the whole shebang</i><br>
<i>&gt; (especially in regard to sexual freedom); actually, Samoans are if</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything even *more* taboo-ridden than we are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Recently, one of her then-adolescent informers (now a grand dame in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Samoan society) owned up to having teased Mead a *lot* in the course of</i><br>
<i>&gt; her researches for the book!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Sorry I can't remember references, but it's quite a well known case in</i><br>
<i>&gt; sociology.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Sorry to make this a short reply, but do you have any dates on when she<br>
was debunked?? I remember clearly in school that my social studies<br>
teachers taught a  lot based on her work in Samoa,and this was in the<br>
1980-86 period.<br>
