<p>
Actually, price/performance ratios for Macs are the same or better than<br>
Intel PCs.  Keep in mind that Macs come with built in ethernet, stereo<br>
sound, video capability, music synthesizers, voice recognition, and<br>
other items that aren't included in some PC prices.<br>
<p>
It's also hard to compare prices on the fastest Motorola or Alpha chips<br>
with Intel chips because Intel can't go that fast yet.  If you need the<br>
fastest machines, the price of Intels become infinity (= not available).<br>

This has been my experience with Microsoft products.  I am currently<br>
trying to build web pages that are standard HTML and compatible with<br>
every browser.  I downloaded Microsoft Internet Explorer to my Macintosh<br>
and installed it.  In the "README.TXT" file it explained that it changed<br>
the data format of my "Internet Config" control panel, which is used by<br>
all TCP/IP programs on my Mac.  It them explained that other programs<br>
may not be compatible with the "newer" version.  Basically, they<br>
reformatted another product's data files in such a way to make it<br>
MS-compatible only, and broke it for other products.<br>
<p>
Another example just occurred at IBM where I work, also involving<br>
Microsoft and Web Pages.  The Microsoft servers wouldn't feed graphics<br>
correctly to Netscape browsers.  They claimed that the Netscape browser<br>
can't view the file, but that Internet Explorer can.  Upon<br>
investigation, it turns out that the files are readable by Netscape, but<br>
that the Microsoft Server refuses to serve to Netscape clients.  When<br>
one of our engineers tried to retaliate by making his webserver refuse<br>
to serve to Microsoft Internet Explorer, we discovered that the<br>
Microsoft browser will misrepresent itself to gain access.  It first<br>
claims to be Microsoft Internet Explorer.  If access is denied, it then<br>
claims to be Netscape Mozilla to gain access.<br>
<p>
There also are many examples of Microsoft products opening back doors on<br>
machines to allow their servers to gain access, or for their anti-piracy<br>
software to check for stolen products on your machine.  Some of these I<br>
have discovered will open listening sockets on the network, even when<br>
networking appears to be disabled and all access permissions are denied.<br>
This latter example occurred with a wordprocessor program on a<br>
"non-networked" machine that was causing network problems for other<br>
machines.  There was no way to open a document file without the machine<br>
turning on the network and communicating data about the local machine to<br>
other Microsoft products on the network.<br>
<p>
As a Network Security consultant, I recommend that my clients do not use<br>
products that deliberately sabatage other products, lie to security<br>
filters to gain access to other machines, or open back doors to the<br>
network that are neither documented or part of the product's normal<br>
function.<br>
