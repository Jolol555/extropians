<i>&gt;Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:</i><br>
<p>
I suspect that many of the technical details you have provided may be =<br>
correct.<br>
The use of Platinum in catalysts is another issue as well. It is my =<br>
understanding, however, that this particular precious metal is not of =<br>
consequence in most of the developing fuel cell technologies. It seems =<br>
that other oxidizing compounds are available at much less cost.=20<br>
<p>
You may wish to conduct further research in this regard to confirm or =<br>
deny the information provided to me as of this date.<br>

Respectfully,<br>
