True for now, until nanotech makes nanomachines which can and do.<br>
By the same token, a sentient nonhuman might also see the risks inherent<br>
in becoming a threat to the species which uplifted it.<br>
<p>
Keith Elis brings up a similar point in regards to AI, but both Elis' and<br>
Butler's<br>
fears can be applied to any transhuman project.  AI, uplifting, augmentation<br>
of humans, allowing MS Windows 98 to hit the market, or Marylin Manson<br>
to play in NJ, all have consequences which we can't foresee.  Is this<br>
really a strang argument against them?  At best, it can be an argument<br>
for caution, but who decides and how much?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't know if you're familiar with Dr. Fouts' work with the signing</i><br>
<i>&gt;chimpanzees (including the famous Washoe). One of the points he raised in</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussions with me was that the chimps were all stuck in an environment</i><br>
<i>&gt;not unlike a prison camp. How grateful/cooperative/happy/docile do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;think the organisms you choose to uplift will be?</i><br>
<p>
My personal tack would be to uplift in an environment that is almost as open<br>
as the oceans, though the cautions you seem to want woudl favor a more<br>
prison camp like environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or are you just thinking of the final result?</i><br>
<p>
Generally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is another reason, perhaps, to prefer mammals--I</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspect people can learn to "read" them easier. OTOH, a chimp with a pull</i><br>
<i>&gt;strength of half a ton could dismember a human if it ever seemed like a</i><br>
<i>&gt;really good idea, and Fouts still had all his arms &amp; legs last time I saw</i><br>
<i>&gt;him. :)</i><br>
<p>
I think it would take too long to uplift a mammal.  Also, the supply of chimps<br>
is too small to really mess around.  And the mammals that are plentiful, e.g.,<br>
rodents, small carnivores (dogs. cats), etc., might even more easily escape<br>
the lab.  (I did write two science fiction stories on this a few years ago.  One<br>
was "Other Minds," which appeared in THE THOUGHT and the other was<br>
"Splitting Hares," which was printed in KASPAHRASTER.  I would think<br>
some better writers out there might use the idea to come up with some<br>
entertaining SF.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Daniel, I'm not just worried about a team of red octopi storming the</i><br>
<i>&gt;streets outside your apartment armed with steak knives and carrying</i><br>
<i>&gt;sandwich-bag knapsacks of seawater (:)). I'm concerned that you not blind</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself to _possible_ real danger to _yourself_ should you start to succeed. </i><br>
<p>
Thanks for your concern.  I kind of like that image of escape sophoctopodes.:)<br>
<p>
I just don't have the same fears as you.<br>
