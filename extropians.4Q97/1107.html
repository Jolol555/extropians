<i>&gt; This is only part of it.  I still don't have his deep distrust of</i><br>
<i>&gt; encryption but I agree that it is unlikely to magically kill off</i><br>
<i>&gt; government.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;generalization&gt;<br>
I'm not sure Brin is "distrustful" of encryption as such, so much<br>
as he is disdainful of the cypherpunk community in particular, and<br>
frankly I tend to agree.  As much as I admire encryption technology<br>
itself, and welcome its consequences such as electronic trade and<br>
elimination of copyrights, the community of cypherpunks itself has<br>
always struck me as a bit juvenile and paranoid.  I don't have that<br>
big a hard-on for privacy, and most of the people I've met who do<br>
just aren't as interesting as people who are less concerned. <br>
&lt;/generalization&gt;<br>
<p>
It is also worth noting that the technologies of strong encryption<br>
are just as useful at ensuring openness as privacy.<br>
