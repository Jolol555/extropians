<i>&gt; If you detect a strain of anger in this post, it comes from too many </i><br>
<i>&gt; years spent cleaning up the senseless human waste wreaked by weapons. </i><br>
<i>&gt; How anyone can look in the eyes of someone crippled and maimed by one </i><br>
<i>&gt; of these tools and then joyously proclaim ownership of one is simply </i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond my limited intellectual capacity.  </i><br>
<p>
If you detect any anger in my replies, it is because those who<br>
fight /against/ weapons have far more blood on their hands than<br>
those who advocate them, and their insufferable arrogance and<br>
faux compassion grows thin after years of solid proof that<br>
private ownership of guns /reduces/ violent crime.  After 10<br>
years of relaxed concealed carry laws in Florida and other states,<br>
we now have hard statistics on that.  Maybe decades ago one could<br>
have argued that guns were "designed only to kill and maim<br>
humans" or were "instruments of destruction" or that "senseless<br>
human waste" was caused by the weapons rather than by the laws<br>
against them; but after the long experience of years and hard<br>
numbers, such rhetoric today is hollow.  Even if one is careful<br>
to stop short of advocating laws, sentiments like that contribute<br>
to attitudes that make such bloody laws popular, despite their<br>
proven miserable failure.<br>
<p>
It is beyond my comprehension as a compassionate human being to<br>
understand how the disarmers can live with themselves after the<br>
suffering they have caused, and continue to advocate disarming<br>
new generations of victims.<br>
<p>
And I find it particularly ironic that such a strong advocate<br>
of women's rights should disdain the very technology that made<br>
equality for women possible.<br>
