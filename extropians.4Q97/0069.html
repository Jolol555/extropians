Question:  How would the economy function in an uploaded society?<br>
<p>
Answer:  First you need a product, and that product is you.  After having<br>
your wetware converted into a new infinitely variable cut-and-paste<br>
consciousness you're ready to start production.  You're not in control of<br>
your production, but everyone else is.  Instead you manage the marketing<br>
side, you've got to sell the product.  Why would anyone want to buy you?<br>
 They don't, they reproduce you.  Maybe you've got a great sense of humour, a<br>
brilliant understanding of quantum theory or you're just easy.  Whatever the<br>
reason, I like you and I want a copy.  So I either copy the parts of you I<br>
like into a new individual, or I cut and paste them into myself.  Well done,<br>
you've just reproduced.<br>
<p>
The more you reproduce, the safer you are.  Reproduction has always been the<br>
main priority in the biological world and the same can be said of the upload<br>
world.  But rather than passing your genes along, you're passing along your<br>
memes.  And the more your mind sprawls into every corner of the memesphere,<br>
the safer you are and the more computation you're getting done.  But if it's<br>
possible to copy consciousness, why not just copy yourself?  Everyone will,<br>
they'll keep copying themselves repeatedly and you'll have not distinct<br>
advantage over anyone else.  But what if you marketed yourself so well, they<br>
also copied you?  Now you have an advantage.<br>
