There were a number of enthusiasts. Nothing definitive was discussed to my<br>
knowledge.  But this is an important question.  I had to leave before our<br>
session was completed, so I'll check with a couple of friends who stayed<br>
after I left and let you know.<br>

Interestingly enough, Dr. White said that in one of the primate models,<br>
there was some movement detected in the front legs.  This is a good sign,<br>
but I'm not sure if it was voluntary or involuntary reflex movement.<br>
Regardless, there was movement.<br>
