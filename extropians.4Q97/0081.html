<i>&gt; &gt; The idea that someday a frozen body will be revived is sort of pseudo-science,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but there are people who take it seriously. Maybe when I'm closer to death's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; door I'll go strange or something, but right now I have no plans along these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good riddens.  Hopefully Microsoft will follow suit!  No more bulky,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unstable software.</i><br>

Here's a notice for you guys, if any of you are looking at the newest<br>
version of Corel Ventura, v 7.0. Don't buy it. The company I am working<br>
at now bought it as an upgrade from version5, which ran just fine. 7.0<br>
however is probably the buggiest app I've ever worked with. Frames don't<br>
stay where you anchor them, spell check locks up on funny characters<br>
that other parts of the program generate for codes, and files get easily<br>
corrupted. I've consistently gotten the blowoff from Corel until I<br>
scream and shout and send them examples of how royally messed up their<br>
software is. Compared to Corel, Microsoft is the most customer freindly<br>
company I've ever dealt with. Needless to say, this 1200 page software<br>
manual I've been working on has taken twice as long as it should have,<br>
so my bosses are pretty ripped about it.<br>
