Why don't you try repeating this silly analogy by giving the 98 pound<br>
weakling a full set of pads and regulation football gear and strip<br>
the linebacker naked.  The weakling will still only weigh around 120<br>
pounds but will be able to walk away from the collision, unlike the<br>
linebacker.  Or to stretch the silly analogy games even further, why<br>
not ask yourself how it is that cops can walk around wearing nothing<br>
but a thin vest of composites and polymers and still live after being<br>
shot with a piece of lead moving fast enough to have KE that makes<br>
your linebacker look like a lightweight?  Kenetic energy is important<br>
when trying to figure out who will survive a collision, but you are<br>
better off betting your life on smart designers and materials<br>
engineers than high-school physics.<br>
