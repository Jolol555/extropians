This looks certainly like a hoax. I have never heard of any security<br>
division of IBM named intelli-connection and a web search only finds<br>
other references to the above page. As Eliezer suggests, the spelling<br>
is rather bad which would be strange for a member of a highly advanced<br>
secret research team. It seems very unlikely that IBM would work on<br>
sedative research (after all, it has as far as I know no knowledge-<br>
base in medicine and pharmacology), and the descriptions of the<br>
implants are utterly wague and definitely do not reveal any specialist<br>
knowledge; instead some of the things sounds definitely made up - why <br>
would there occur bleeding at the nose *and* ears after implantation if <br>
it was done through one of them? And what really gave it away was <br>
the 116 MHz figure. Real neural implants work in the 100 Hz-100 kHz<br>
range, radio frequency stimulation doesn't have any effect. <br>
<p>
To sum up, the above web page is either a not very good hoax (I know<br>
I could write up a much more believable myself) or the result of<br>
paranoid schizophrenia (in the past people though they heard and saw<br>
angels and demons, now it is secret government chips). <br>
<p>
On the other hand, behavior-influencing implants are possible, no<br>
question about it. It is not that far from the classic rat experiments <br>
where it was found that rats were strongly conditioned to get <br>
stimulation in their medial septal region, over José Delgado's experiments <br>
with hypothalamic stimulations and Robert Heath's experiments with<br>
"brain pacemakers" during the 70's to a real human implant. Our brains<br>
are not that much different than animal brains, although our motivations<br>
get rather complex. We certainly have the technology to do implants<br>
like this (although they would likely require open-skull surgery and<br>
the placement of a subdermal battery to work), but fortunately it<br>
would be extremely hard to hide and most likely far too expensive to<br>
use in prison applications (if you are an evil Hollywood-style warden,<br>
why not just drug the prisoners?).<br>
<p>
As for the real brain implants, things are moving along nicely (although<br>
likely too slow for the taste of many of us, I expect). We are learning<br>
about the tropich factors that make neurons grow in different directions,<br>
how to make smaller silicon probes or dies for interfaces and how<br>
to coat them with suitable proteins. I'm getting fairly optimistic<br>
about this area. But, as I said, the likely applications will first<br>
be functional electric stimulation to the handicapped, artificial<br>
senses and modulation for certain brain dysfunctions rather than<br>
X-files style projects. <br>
