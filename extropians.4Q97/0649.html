<p>
If by "government" you mean as I do, something that claims rights and powers  <br>
that individuals do not have and corporation could not dream of, then the <br>
answer from history is as obvious as it is tragic.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Individual human beings are volitional.  We have  power of choice.</i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
It's not that easy, my power is limited, I can't do what I don't want to do I <br>
can only do what I want to do, and by pulling my fingernails off one by one <br>
with a pair of pliers you can radically change  what I want to do. Government <br>
learned that long ago, and they don't have to do it to everybody to stay in<br>
power, just enough to generate a climate of fear.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The notion that we can be "externally controlled" is a myth. It's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;only because most people have been brainwashed into believing and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;obeying terrocrats</i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
Don't underestimate them, believing such creatures is irrational, but obeying  <br>
them is most certainly not. Galileo was not tortured but he was shown the <br>
instruments for it, as the worlds greatest  expert on mechanics at the time <br>
he certainly understood how such machines operated, as a result he publicly<br>
apologized for his scientific ideas and said in writing that the church was <br>
right, the Earth was the center of the universe after all. I certainly don't <br>
hold this against Galileo, instead I look at it as yet another example of the <br>
man's enormous intellect. Only 20 years before, another astronomer Giordano<br>
Bruno, said that space was infinite, the stars were like the sun only very <br>
far away and life probably filled the universe, but Bruno was not as smart as <br>
Galileo, he refused to recant his views. For the crime of heresy Bruno was <br>
burned alive in the center of Rome so all could see, according to custom <br>
green wood was used because it doesn't burn as hot so it takes longer to kill.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Considering these cybernetic factors, you could conclude that, in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;order for "government control" to be possible: (i) The terrocrats who         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;masquerade as "government" would have to have extremely fast brains</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Little danger in that.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The "controlled" victims would have to provide the terrocrats with         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;all the information necessary for "external control" (or the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;terrocrats would have to be omniscient); (iii) The "controlled"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;victims would have to have  extremely slow brains</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Again I think you're underestimating these people because all you've  proved <br>
is that government can't force a society to go in any  direction it wants, <br>
but that much is obvious, communist leaders repeatedly gave orders for their <br>
society to move in the direction of prosperity, it didn't, but that doesn't <br>
mean their silly orders didn't change things. Government doesn't have the<br>
power to engineer the world to their liking, but it can see to it that my <br>
present wishes remain unfulfilled and it can make my future desires be very <br>
simple, either to stop pulling my fingernails out or just slit my throat <br>
and put an end to it.                             <br>
