This is what Chomsky has spent his activist life talking about.  Of<br>
course, he's an anarchosyndicalist and believes wage labor is slavery and<br>
private property is injust, granted, but his criticisms of the<br>
authoritarianism of the state and corporation and the orthodoxy they<br>
manufacture through news media seem to me to be dead on.  Western<br>
democracies don't need to beat people up to enforce the status quo<br>
(although they do engage in that to some degree; drug enforcement springs<br>
immediately to mind); why waste resources on that when you can play on<br>
the group-think instinct?<br>
