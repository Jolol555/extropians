Apparently this was a study lasting 12 years. Does that mean that<br>
the basic idea here was known that long ago? We could do with an<br>
information center that listed proposed therapies, along with<br>
rankings from "Certainly wouldn't work" through "Speculative"<br>
to "Repeatedly demonstrated to work".<br>
<p>
It would also be interesting to know *which* neurons can<br>
be replaced by the introduced cells. How do they pick their<br>
targets? etc.<br>

*** Scientists in breakthrough to replace brain cells<br>
British scientists have discovered a method of replacing damaged<br>
brain cells which could offer hope to millions of sufferers of<br>
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.<br>
Scientists in London found that rats which suffered brain damage from<br>
simulated heart attacks recovered completely if they were injected<br>
with embryonic brain cells from mice. The implanted brain cells,<br>
called neuroepithelial stem cells or NESCs, found their way to the<br>
damaged brain cells and took over their functions. For the full text<br>
