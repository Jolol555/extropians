After reading several utilitarian non-arguments on guns I wish to point out<br>
a few flaws- First the American left has tried to pin violence on firearms.<br>
Their propaganda from HCI and others suggests that if guns were eliminated<br>
we would be safe.  Many of the posts on Extropians center on "guns".  The<br>
facts are that firearm violence accounts for a minor percentage of American<br>
violence.  You are much more likely to be stabbed or clobbered with a bat.<br>
<p>
<p>
According to the US Department of Justice' Bureau of Justice Statistics...<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/</a><br>
<p>
Most violent victimizations did not involve the use of weapons.  Offenders<br>
were armed in 34% of victimizations of males (2,042,000) and in 24% of<br>
victimizations of females (1,126,100)<br>
<p>
Read "Violence-Related Injuries Treated in Hospital Emergency Departments<br>
August 1997, NCJ-156921 Michael R. Rand BJS Statistician"<br>
<p>
* People injured in violence were treated for a<br>
variety of injuries:<br>
<p>
34% for bruises or similar injuries<br>
31% for cuts, stab wounds, or<br>
internal injuries<br>
17% for fractures, sprains, dislocations, dental<br>
injuries, or other muscular/skeletal injuries<br>
5% for gunshot injuries<br>
5% for rapes/other sexual assaults<br>
4% for concussions or other head<br>
injuries<br>
5% for other injuries.<br>
<p>
* About 92% of violence victims treated in ED's were released at<br>
once after treatment; about 7% were hospitalized for further<br>
treatment.<br>
<p>
It really is true the adage: "Guns don't kill, people do."<br>
<p>
