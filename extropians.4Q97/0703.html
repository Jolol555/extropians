<i>&gt; This message is being circulated throughout the Internet, and I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; know where it originated, although it came with attachments coded in </i><br>

<p>
A:    Bet your bippy!!!  In a word: "YES"<br>
<p>
      Worse:  Microsoft Corporation's Windows95 _already has these <br>
      routines coded into it_, with rather weak encrypted lockouts.  These <br>
      lockouts can be (and are being) broken by any competent Signals <br>
      Intelligent outfit, and by _anyone else_ who can afford a trip to <br>
      Russia to buy the services of a retired Russian cryptanalyst trying <br>
      to feed his family on cardboard and water...   That means that every <br>
      Windows95 user in the world who uses the (insecure) Internet -- even <br>
      with (the equally insecure) PGP -- is already -- for computing and <br>
      data security purposes -- living in a glasshouse with no clothes <br>
      on... &gt;:-}  Quite exciting...  I'll stay with my Atari Falcon and <br>
      steganography, perhaps.<br>
<p>
      The 'bad guys' can search, get _and put_ files to your hard drives <br>
      at will.<br>
<p>
      That is (ferinstance), all the uptight 'Moral Majority' crowd could <br>
      already have really gross 'kiddie porn' piccies on their hard drives <br>
      _right now_...  All their back filed letters subtly altered in <br>
      various horribly incriminating ways...<br>
<p>
      Use some imagination (NSA certainly do!)   The mind boggles...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      "While class consciousness is a continuous topic of conversation in <br>
      European society,from lowest to highest stratum, Americans seem to <br>
      find the ideas offensive and most 'impolite' conversation.  Only <br>
      rightist kooks and commies talk about ruling classes and class <br>
      structures. Rothbardians and neo-Rothbardians fight this "love which <br>
      casnnot mention its name" (to borrow from Oscar Wilde) inhibition to <br>
      discussion and elaboration of class theory in various ways..." -- <br>

<p>
<p>
      The original (daffy!) idea of the Great Microsoft Scam was that US <br>
      Intelligence would gain access to everone's personal computers <br>
      worldwide via the Internet, and -- as a 'quid pro quo' -- all <br>
      Microsoft Corporation's competitors would be 'disappeared.'  (The <br>
      Prez has openly tasked NSA and CIA to garner commercial intelligence <br>
      of value to US Corporations, worldwide).<br>
<p>
      An irresistible temptation, huh?  "Let's Pull A Fast One On Joey!"<br>
<p>
<p>
      Trouble is, it's completely illegal.  And civilly actionable...<br>
<p>
<p>
      It directly violates NSA's Legal Charter, and the sworn Oath of <br>
      Allegiance to the Constitution of the United states of every <br>
      relevant government official who's involved...  Worse, every other <br>
      US Government Spaghetti Agency (FBI, IRS, the list goes on...) who <br>
      learned of the 'backdoors' wanted in on the 'take' and their piece <br>
      of the pie -- and spooks do love to gossip... All the NSA and CIA <br>
      folk I chat with have known of this problem for quite some time.<br>
<p>
<p>
      All this leaves the Federales looking rather like a circular firing <br>
      squad, all pointing their rifles inwards, but with no-one actually <br>
      standing in the middle anymore...<br>
<p>
<p>
      William Neukom (Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer at their Redmond HQ, <br>
      who has called me to discuss this problem -- a nice 'man in a <br>
      foxhole'); and Bill Gates (who I faxed directly in June concerning <br>
      these matters) are presently trying to fight the spooks and flics <br>
      and fuzz and Vopos and Federales off their backs.<br>
<p>
      They need all the help they can get (the good guys, that is!)<br>
<p>

(Just try a string search-and-replace of 'AOL' with 'Microsoft Corporation')<br>
<p>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From a former AOL employee:</i><br>
<p>
I'll try and cut through the crap, and try to get to the point of this <br>
letter.  I used to work for America Online, and would like to remain <br>
anonymous for that reason.  I was laid off in early September, but I <br>
know exactly why I was laid off, which I will now explain:<br>
<p>
Since last December, I had been one of the many people assigned to <br>
design AOL 4.0 for Windows  (AOL 4.0 beta, codenamed Casablanca).  In <br>
the beginning, I was very proud of this task, until I found out the true <br>
cost of it.  Things were going fine until about mid-February, when me <br>
and 2 of my colleagues started to suspect a problem, an unexplainable <br>
'Privacy Invasion', with the new version.  One of them, who is a master <br>
programmer, copied the finished portion of the new version (Then 'Build <br>
52'), and took it home, and we spent nearly 2 weeks of sleepless nights <br>
examining and debugging the program, flipping it inside-out, and here is <br>
what we found.<br>
<p>
Unlike all previous versions of America Online, version 4.0 puts <br>
something in your hard drive called a 'cookie'.  (AOL members click &lt;A <br>
HREF="aol://4344:1047.g334.8411481.532897009"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; for a<br>
definition).  However, the cookie we found on Version 4.0 was far more <br>
treacherous than the simple internet cookie.  How would you like <br>
somebody looking at your entire hard drive, snooping through any (yes, <br>
any) piece of information on your hard drive.  It could also read your <br>
password and log in information and store it deep in the program code. <br>
Well, all previous versions, whether you like it or not, have done this <br>
to a certain extent, but only with files you downloaded.  As me and my <br>
colleagues discovered, with the new version, anytime you are signed on <br>
to AOL, any top aol executive, any aol worker, who has been sworn to <br>
secrecy regarding this feature, can go into your hard drive and retrieve <br>
any piece of information that they so desire.  Billing, download <br>
records, e-mail, directories, personal documents, programs, financial <br>
information, scanned images, etc ... Better start keeping all those <br>
pictures on a floppy disk!<br>
<p>
This is a totally disgusting violation of our rights, and your right to <br>
know as well.  Since this is undoubtably 'Top Secret' information that I <br>
am revealing, my life at AOL is pretty much over.  After discovering <br>
this information, we started to inform a few other workers at America <br>
Online, so that we could get a large enough crew to stop this from <br>
happening to the millions of unfortunate and unsuspecting America Online <br>
members.  This was in early August.  One month later, all three of us <br>
were unemployed.  We got together, and figured there was something we <br>
had to do to let the public know.<br>
<p>
Unemployed, with one of us going through a divorce (me) and another who <br>
is about to undergo treatment for Cancer, our combined financial <br>
situation is not currently enough to release any sort or article.  We <br>
attempted to create a web page on three different servers containing <br>
in-depth information on AOL 4.0, but all three were taken down within 2 <br>
days.  We were running very low on time (4.0 is released early this <br>
winter), so we figured our last hope to reveal this madness before it <br>
effects the people was starting something similar to a chain letter, <br>
this letter you are reading.  Please do the following, to help us expose <br>
AOL for who they really are, and to help us and yourself recieve <br>
personal gratification for taking a stand for our freedom:<br>
<p>
1.          Forward this letter to as many people as you can (not just friends <br>
        and family, as many as you can!)<br>
<p>
2.          Tell people who aren't on America Online in person, especially <br>
        important people (Private Investigators, Government workers, City <br>
        Council)<br>
<p>
3.        If the information about the new version isn't exposed by the time <br>
        aol is released early this winter, for your own protection, DON'T <br>
        DOWNLOAD AOL 4.0 UNDER ANY CONDITION !!!<br>
<p>
Thank you for reading and examining this information.  Me and my <br>
colleagues hope that you will help us do the right thing in this <br>
situation.  Enjoy America Online (just kidding!).<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
A former AOL employee<br>
