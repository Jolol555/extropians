<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swiss psychotherapist Alice Miller's horrifying book on the subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'poisonous pedagogy' -- "'For Your Own Good':  The Roots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Violence in Child-Rearing" (Virago, [1987] -- is an inclusive and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; comprehensive descriptive and explanatory account, which answers the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; basic question: "How would you have to bring up a child, for him or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; her to be a violent adult?"</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Anyone who claims to come anywhere close to answering a question</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; like that can be immediately dismissed as a crackpot.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; so many completely unstudied and misunderstood aspects of learning,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; socialization, genetic predisposition, and blind chance involved</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in child-rearing that any claim of any "scientific" result in it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is utterly specious.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about reading the book before offering your opinion?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I don't see Tony stating that Dr Miller's work is "scientific". I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could just as easily call you a "scientistic bigot". Also, Dr Miller's</i><br>
<i>&gt; work provides a starting point for research which definitely needs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done.</i><br>
<p>
If the claims above are Tony's claims about Ms. Miller's book<br>
rather than Ms. Miller's claims, then perhaps it is he who should<br>
be dismissed as a crackpot rather than her.  Having not read the<br>
book, you are correct that I cannot make that judgment.<br>
<p>
I do, however, stand by this particular prejudice of mine: as I<br>
have pointed out, it is impossible to study every question that<br>
affects your life in the complete detail necessary to make<br>
epistemologically ideal decisions.  Human brains just can't<br>
process that fast.  So it is useful to have heuristic short-cuts<br>
to make most of them, and to study in more detail when the need<br>
and/or opportunity arises.  This is called "prejudice", and it<br>
is a valuable cognitive function.  It can also be dangerous,<br>
especially when those prejudices are irrational ones.  <br>
<p>
The cure for irrational prejudice is not to get rid of prejudice,<br>
but to form more rational ones, and to understand, acknowledge,<br>
and be honest about them, and to know when to break out of them<br>
and study further.<br>
<p>
I have a definite prejudice in favor of those who express ideas<br>
with scientific skepticism, and against those who make grand<br>
claims of solving difficult problems.  It serves me well.  There<br>
are times when I have broken out of that prejudice to study<br>
further.  This is not one of those times; perhaps when I have<br>
children, and the need for more accurate knowledge of child<br>
rearing strategies makes further study worthwhile, I might take<br>
the time to do so.  But until then, I will continue to call<br>
anyone who makes such gross claims as to know what child rearing<br>
methods produce violence--or even that child rearing is the<br>
primary determinant--crackpots.<br>
<p>
I also recognize that this area--and other areas of psychology--<br>
"scientific" knowledge is so scarce that "crackpot" ideas are<br>
worth more serious study than in other fields.  I would feel just<br>
as comfortable talking to a shaman about some psychological<br>
problem as I would a "trained" Freudian, because I know that they<br>
are equally unscientific, so one is as likely to succeed as the<br>
other.<br>
