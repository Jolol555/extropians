<p>
Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the<br>
digestive system and the liver to be assimulated properly. You<br>
cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. It is<br>
a dangerous and impossible long term practice and would be<br>
extremely foolish to initiate voluntarily. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.</i><br>
<p>
Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.<br>
On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount<br>
of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally<br>
supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.<br>
I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately<br>
high altitudes may have increase longevity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).</i><br>
<p>
A laudable goal, but how do you implement it without exercise?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do not move anything that will not save your life.</i><br>
<p>
This is probably inconsistent with the previous one unless, you<br>
make sure to continuously surrround yourself with precariously<br>
balanced boxes which might at any time fall on you :-) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Movement means free-radicals.</i><br>
<p>
So does eating, breathing and being alive. Free-radicals are both<br>
harmful and necessary for life at the same time. It's where they<br>
are formed and how they are dealt with that is important.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free radicals.</i><br>
<p>
In the right places and at the right times, they are part of the<br>
metabolic processes of life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill yourself.</i><br>
<p>
A much too simplistic view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe. But it is also going to kill you quite quickly for other reasons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Tell me if anyone knows how this view could be bad,</i><br>
<p>
For the reasons stated above (and many others), its very bad<br>
excluding the negatives below (and many others).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;excluding the arguments of </i><br>
<i>&gt;1) Willpower requirements.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2) Missed opportunities due to confinment to reclining wheelchair and IV.</i><br>
<p>
How were you intending to do the basic exercise functions (walking, and<br>
breathing 'fully') you listed if you are confined to a wheelchair.<br>
