Getting tired of your body? Why not try a new one.<br>

"The Holy Father has never voiced any objection. As far as I<br>
know, there isn't a problem with the operation from a theological or<br>
an ethical point of view."<br>
<p>
Dr. Robert White, professor of neurosurgery at the Case University in<br>
Cleveland, Ohio, speaks with authority, both on surgery and on the<br>
Pope.<br>
<p>
A frequent visitor to the Vatican, White is a member of the<br>
Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He helped to set up the John Paul II <br>
committee on medical ethics.<br>
<p>
So it is a surprise to discover "the operation" White refers to is<br>
the removal of one person's head and its surgical attachment to<br>
someone else's body.<br>
<p>
The most common reaction to the idea of a head transplant is not=<br>
merely a question of 'How could anyone do that?' but 'Why would any<br>
sane person want to?<br>
<p>
"That's a very uninformed reactions," says White, a sprightly<br>
70-year-old. "We really have to grow up -- and we will. There was a very similar<br>
reaction when organ transplants first became possible nearly 40 years<br>
ago.<br>
<p>
"And I have no doubt that within the next 50 years head transplants<br>
will be as common as kidney transplants are today."<br>
<p>
White is not joking. In fact, he believes that he could perform the<br>
operation successfully now.<br>
<p>
It is more than 20 years since he transplanted the head of one<br>
monkey on to the body of another.<br>
<p>
"The monkey could see. His eyes followed you round the room.<br>
He could eat, and if you were stupid enough to put your finger<br>
in his mouth, he would have bitten it off."<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the monkey could not move. He was paralysed from the<br>
neck down.<br>
<p>
"How to connect up the spinal cord to the new head is a difficulty I<br>
haven't tried to solve. It's an immensely complex problem. But it will<br>
be solved, in my view, and before too long."<br>
<p>
You might think that in the absence of knowing how to "connect up the<br>
spinal cord," head transplants would be of little use. According to<br>
White, you'd be profoundly wrong.<br>
<p>
"When I was working on transplanting the heads of monkeys in the<br>
Seventies, my interests were those of pure research: it was the<br>
only way<br>
to study important aspects of brain-functioning and chemistry.<br>
<p>
"For instance, I discovered the enormous benefits to the brain of<br>
temperature reduction. At normal temperature your brain would die in<br>
about three minutes if starved of oxygen. But at 15 C, I could shut<br>
off oxygen and blood for half an hour and there would be no adverse<br>
effects."<br>
<p>
Understandably, animal rights activists are not fond of White. He<br>
faced death threats and needed FBI protection.<br>
<p>
"I do not accept any criticism from those people. They have behaved<br>
disgracefully to me and my family. I cannot accept that animals are<br>
comparable to people."<br>
<p>
You can recognize that point, yet still feel uneasy when looking at<br>
the footage of the transplanted monkey's head. The information White<br>
gained from that experiment was clearly interesting but hardly<br>
significant enough, in terms of the possible benefit to humans, to<br>
show that yuk is not the appropriate response to it.<br>
<p>
But White insists the operations "have real life-saving potential."<br>
<p>
<p>
White believes that "total body transplantation," as he prefers to<br>
call it, could help quadraplegics enormously. "They die from multiple<br>
organ failure. They are not thought to be suitable targets for organ<br>
donation. If we could give them a new body, then they could live much<br>
longer."<br>
<p>
Already, people have put their names down for White's operation, in<br>
the hope that some day soon, he will be allowed to perform it.<br>
<p>
Craig Vetovitz, left paralysed from the neck down by a diving<br>
accident, would like to be the first. Vetovitz stresses he is "well aware of the<br>
risks. But if it can promote and accelerate this type of research . .<br>
 I'd be prepared to do it."<br>
<p>
While Vetovitz and others like him might be willing to undergo<br>
White's pioneering surgery, no one in authority will let him perform it, at<br>
least not in the U. S.<br>
<p>
For now, there is no chance of ethics committees approving it,<br>
White concedes. He does not think this is because the operation raises<br>
serious ethical issues.<br>
<p>
"I would not be performing experiments on people. I have already<br>
done the appropriate dissections on human cadavers."<br>
<p>
So what's the problem? "The media circus that would surround the<br>
operation if it was performed in America. That and the fact that we<br>
do not yet know how long someone with a total body transplant would<br>
survive."<br>
<p>
But White says that was the problem with heart transplants when<br>
they were first done.<br>
<p>
<p>
White might simply decide to do the operation outside the U.S. He has<br>
been invited to the Ukraine. "They have very fine neurosurgical<br>
facilities," he notes. And they also have no ethics committees.<br>
<p>
"Sure," adds White. "But ethics are really not the issue. We're talking<br>
about saving lives here."<br>
<p>
Others are not so sure. Brian Jennett, who recently retired as<br>
professor of neurosurgery in Glasgow, is sceptical of the value of White's<br>
research.<br>
<p>
"As far as I can see, this kind of operation, whether on animals or<br>
humans, does not have much value in terms of furthering knowledge.<br>
<p>
<p>
"And the crucial question is: 'What is its practical result in<br>
terms of benefit to the patient?' I haven't seen any evidence that there is a<br>
significant benefit."<br>
<p>
As a committed Catholic, White would be deeply concerned if the<br>
Catholic Church was opposed to head transplants. It is unlikely to be<br>
a problem, he says.<br>
<p>
"The Church accepted the concept of brain death. It is now<br>
recognized that if the brain is unable to function at all, then the person is<br>
clinically dead, even if his or her body is intact, and can function.<br>
Brain-dead people will be the source of the bodies to be transplanted<br>
on to new heads."<br>
<p>
But what about God? "Head transplantation does not violate any<br>
fundamental theological principle," says Dr. Helen Watt of the<br>
Catholic Lincare Centre for Medical Ethics.<br>
<p>
"The religious objections are essentially practical. They centre on<br>
such things as the effects on the donor's relatives of his body being<br>
attached to a different head."<br>
<p>
It is easy to imagine those effects could be traumatic. It would, at<br>
the very least, be extremely disorienting to have (say) your wife's<br>
body used in a head transplant operation -- particularly if the<br>
problem of connecting up the spinal cord was solved, so the new<br>
individual could be as= mobile as the old one.<br>
<p>
Who would the new person be? Your wife with a new head? Or a<br>
different person who had been given her body?<br>
<p>
These questions raise profound questions about the nature of<br>
personal identity. White does not have much time for them.<br>
<p>
"I think everyone accepts that personality lies in the brain."<br>
<p>
He also recognizes a person's identity is not exhausted by his<br>
brain. "The soul defines identity."<br>
<p>
However basic the contradiction may seem to others, White does not<br>
experience any tension between his religious and scientific<br>
outlooks.<br>
<p>
"Operating on the brain is an almost mystical experience.<br>
<p>
"When you start to understand it, you just cannot regard it as a<br>
wholly natural product. When I look at this 3 pound lump of<br>
white jelly, and think what it can do . . . it amazes me."<br>
