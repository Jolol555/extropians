<i>&gt;From: Arjen Kamphuis &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: Excedo: What's in a name?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Recently there has been some discussion about the name of the (still</i><br>
<i>&gt;unofficial - non-registered) Dutch Transhumanist Society "Excedo". Henri</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kluytmans, founding member, came up with this name several months ago and</i><br>
<i>&gt;we all agreed that it was right for us. Strickly speaking it's Latin but</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dutch people (most of whom have a reasonable command of English) would</i><br>
<i>&gt;associate it with words like 'Exceed' and 'Excel'. It also sound like</i><br>
<i>&gt;something fast and dynamic. We felt (and feel) this name would nicely</i><br>
<i>&gt;represent our &gt;H idea's about the great possibilities we see in the (near)</i><br>
<i>&gt;future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A few weeks ago Berrie, who has been working very hard on laying the</i><br>
<i>&gt;groundwork for a well-organized Dutch &gt;H Ssociety, started an E-mail</i><br>
<i>&gt;correspondance with Tom about our name. Tom was worried that there might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;confusion between the Extropy Institute and Excedo because of the name.</i><br>
<p>
I understand Tom's concern.<br>
<p>
Extropians like to put "ex" infront of many words.<br>
<p>
No one owns the letters "ex".<br>
<p>
No one owns meaning of the letters "ex".<br>
<p>
There are many people named John Smith <br>
who are not being sued for identity theft.<br>
<p>
"Extropy" and "Excedo"<br>
are even less similar than elements and elevators <br>
but not many people can stand on any pile of atoms <br>
and say, "Second floor please." without looking like a fool.<br>
<p>
This argument is an <br>
Exceedingly <br>
Excellent <br>
Example of an<br>
Excrutiatingly <br>
Excessive and <br>
Exaggerated <br>
Exchange of<br>
Examinated <br>
Excrement without<br>
Excuse.<br>
