<i>&gt; Considering that the people most likely to transcend to posthuman states</i><br>

<i>&gt; mundanes during childhood and adolescence, I think it highly likely that</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least one, if not many, of the first post humans will have highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative viewpoints towards mundanes, and extremely negative viewpoints</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards anti-tech and anti-intellectual idiots</i><br>
<p>
I have a small confession to make: as you might guess, my childhood<br>
peers were not particularly fond of people who wanted to read or think<br>
about "weird" things. As a result, I decided in a classical cartoon<br>
mad scientist style to get my revenge upon them in the future, in some<br>
creative way (preferably involving large amounts of thermonuclear<br>
power or something similar). But a while later I realized that any<br>
normal kind of revenge would be rather pointless; what would I really<br>
accomplish with it? Instead I came up with a truly devious plan: I<br>
wanted to remake the world so that the likes of me would be on top,<br>
and all the idiots would know that in order to become successful they<br>
would have to become like me. That would be a most fitting revenge,<br>
and quite constructive too.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately Bill Gates seems to have beaten me to my revenge, but it<br>
still seems to work. :-)<br>
<p>
Seriously, I think it is more rational and efficient to find ways to<br>
circumvent or ignore the anti-tech/anti-intellectuals. Direct<br>
confrontations are so silly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reactionaries will of course be on the opposite side, forming</i><br>
<i>&gt; terrorist insurgencies to oppose the transition. Anyone who thinks the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transcendant period will not be violently dynamic is living in a fools</i><br>
<i>&gt; paradise.</i><br>
<p>
We discussed this at the Aleph dinner yesterday. One idea we came up<br>
with in order to avoid strong reactionary forces is to make sure we<br>
listen to dissidents, and make them an acknowledged part of our way of<br>
planning. Despite their views, they sometimes have true things to say,<br>
and letting them argue their case makes some of the steam blow off,<br>
which otherwise would have increased the pressure.<br>
