I want reliable software; at home I use Linux for everything but the <br>
few applications I want which don't run on it.<br>

<p>
Nonsense; Microsoft receives a massive subsidy from the world's<br>
governments in the form of copyright enforcement. Without that it<br>
would be a much smaller company than it is today.<br>
<p>
Having said all that, I've recently moved from working on Linux to<br>
working on Windows, and I'm impressed by the amount it's improved<br>
since my last 'Windows experience' with 3.0. The main things that bug <br>
me are the memory usage, sluggish performance (a 166 MHz Pentium <br>
running Windows 95 feels much slower than a 90 MHz Pentium running<br>
Linux), and the way that the applications work fine until you want to<br>
use them with something other than a Microsoft application (e.g.<br>
exporting email into a standard Unix mail file format). <br>
<p>
Then there are the little things; I installed Netscape because Internet<br>
Explorer was so unreliable, and if I run Explorer it puts up a panel<br>
asking whether I want to reinstall it as the default browser, like <br>
no-one could possibly want to run a browser that wasn't written by<br>
Microsoft.<br>
<p>
The other problem is security, which is notoriously lax. And Microsoft<br>
go a long way to reduce it themselves; for example I read recently that<br>
IE 4.0 has a 'feature' which allows any Web site to retrieve a list of<br>
recently visited sites from your browser... I'm sure that will come in<br>
very handy for industrial espionage in the future. I won't even mention<br>
Word macros or ActiveX downloads.<br>
