<i>&gt; weapons.  </i><br>
<p>
My concept is for a nuclear reactor, not a bomb. The name is taken from<br>
a movie<br>
depicting such a device. I had considered patenting some time ago, but<br>
have<br>
abandoned it for several reasons. Firstly, "reducing to practice" is<br>
very <br>
problematical. Many isues would have to be clarified, and I have other<br>
things<br>
to do. There are also much sweeter means of acheiving the same thing,<br>
which I<br>
might patent.<br>
