<i>&gt;Please explain to me how you come up with the figures of  80-95% of</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, you're right.  I was looking at the "other" column, which fluctuates<br>
between about 7% an 15%, and subtracting that from 100.  The problem<br>
is that the percentages quoted don't seem to add up to 100.  Something<br>
is not being counted, and I don't know what it is.  But you're right<br>
that if you add up the columns "handguns" and "firearms", the numbers<br>
are closer to 50-70% of murders being committed using guns.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[stuff about defending himself and his family from criminals]</i><br>

As I've said, those may be valid reasons for wanting to own a gun.  And,<br>
if I lived in certain parts of the US, I might be more prone to own a gun,<br>
too.  This leads nicely to...<br>

True.  I wonder why.  (I'm not being sarcastic.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are other differences between the US and the other</i><br>

Possibly.  Another possibility:<br>

<i>&gt;Another big factor I can't identify in words, but it is definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt;related to the Canadian psyche and is possibly the same reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt;during the American Revolution, the Canadians did not join in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;revolt.</i><br>
<p>
True.  As a friend of mine puts it, "Canada *exists* primarily for<br>
the purpose of not being the United States."  Before the American<br>
Revolution, Canada was just as much a French colony as a British<br>
one.  Then the "United Empire Loyalists" fled north to Canada during<br>
and after the American Revolution, and from that point on, they (we?)<br>
were the majority, and have loved to define Canada as "not American"<br>
ever since.  One of Canada's most proud differences from the US is<br>
our lower rate of violence.  Many people think this is *because* we<br>
don't have easy access to guns.  I don't think it's that simple, but<br>
it's probably a factor.  I think a larger factor is simply our culture,<br>
which *tries* to be less violent than the US simply because it's one<br>
of the most obvious ways we can differentiate ourselves from the US.<br>
Which leads me to...<br>

<i>&gt;I think the best explanation for the violence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;US compared to Canada is culture.  Americans began their country by</i><br>
<i>&gt;fighting, Canadians just waited it out until we were *given* independence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which was the better strategy?  Who cares, but the point is that this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflection of cultural differences (which I think are slowly blurring)</i><br>
<i>&gt;One important motivator for Canadians to avoid violence is that many</i><br>
<i>&gt;Canadians pride themselves on being as un-American as they can, and most</i><br>
<i>&gt;Canadians see Americans as violent (just look at all the movies that come</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of Hollywood!)  Hopefully, the Canadian tendency towards nonviolent</i><br>
<i>&gt;solutions will rub off on the US, and the US tendency to prize individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;liberty will rub off on Canada</i><br>
<p>
It would be nice, but unforunately the exact opposite is happening.<br>
Canada is becoming more violent, while the US is becoming less free.<br>
In Toronto, for example, overall crime rates have dropped slightly<br>
in the past few years, but *violent* crime has gone up.  I'm not<br>
sure why.  Perhaps the violent culture of our Big Brother to the<br>
south is finally rubbing off on us.<br>

<i>&gt;I think your concept of an ethnically homogenous Canada either comes from</i><br>

<p>
I agree wholeheartedly.  Parts of Canada are indeed very homogeneous;<br>
other parts are extremely multicultural.  Like Vancouver, Toronto has<br>
a huge asian population.  Also plenty of Indians (not the North-American<br>
type), Italians, Portugese, Greeks... the list goes on.  One of the<br>
best benefits of this is the diversity of food.  :-)  I love the fact<br>
that, within walking distance of my office, there is genuinely good<br>
food from all over the world.  And like Vancouver, many departments<br>
on the U of Toronto campus have huge numbers of asians; in my own<br>
department (computer science), I believe asians number at least as<br>
many as people of European descent.<br>

<i>&gt;It is interesting that you said absolutely nothing about the Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt;DC Murder rates.</i><br>
<p>
"Never ascribe to malice what can adequately explained by ignorance."<br>
I didn't mention them because I didn't have them handy, and I'm not<br>
familiar with them in any case.  I don't claim to be an expert on<br>
gun use in any part of the world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Studies of gun crime in the US show that gun crime rates are highest in</i><br>
<i>&gt;areas that have the most restrictive gun control laws.</i><br>
<p>
Another interesting data point indicating that the US is generally<br>
more violent than other first-world nations, since most other countries<br>
have more restrictive gun control laws than *anywhere* in the US, yet<br>
gun crime rates are *not* higher than in the US.  I'm not flinging<br>
mud here, I'm just emphasizing again that the extra freedoms that<br>
you have come at a cost of a more violent culture.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, on the overall murder rates being higher, I won't debate, its</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious that a free society like ours will tend to grant its citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt;the liberty to be able to commit the sort of crimes involved, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;societies like those in europe, descended from fuedal systems in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;only the aristocracy had a right to bear arms, are obviously not free,</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  Why are they obviously not free?  And to what extend freedom?  We<br>
are free to travel as we please, within and between countries; we vote<br>
for our leaders, just as you do; we have (as a practical matter)<br>
freedom of speech, religion, association, and the press, just as the US<br>
is supposed to have.  (Of course there are problems, but legally and<br>
in practice we have similar rights.)  I don't know about the European<br>
countries, but Canada has a Charter of Rights and Freedoms as part of<br>
our Constitution (contrary to what somebody said a few days back).<br>
Certainly there are minor differences of degree and kind in the details,<br>
but I would hardly call Canada or any of the western European countries<br>
"obviously not free".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[obviously not free,]</i><br>
<i>&gt;in that the government protects the citizens from themselves.</i><br>
<p>
It seems that your definition of "free" lies solely in the right to<br>
bear arms.  I believe this is an extremely narrow view.  Are the<br>
other freedoms I mention above worth nothing?<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong.  I don't believe, a priori, that gun ownership is<br>
bad.  As I've said, I've been on a rifle team where strict safety<br>
procedures were taught.  People on this list (including yourself)<br>
have complained how gun owners are often portrayed as madmen.  Would<br>
you complain if, for example, the *only* law that stood between you<br>
and a gun was a requirement to take a safety course?  Would that<br>
be an opprossive law leading to a state that is "obviously not free"?<br>
<p>
[I'm trying to figure out if we're talking at cross-pursposes here,<br>
or if we really do have a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes<br>
"freedom".]<br>
