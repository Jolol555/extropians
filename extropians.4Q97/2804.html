<i>&gt; &gt; victim. (would you rather be shot in the head or stabbed to death?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; off the ground, or your fist), ergo the only way to stay free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is to arm yourself against those who would oppress you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Having spent fair amount of time traveling through Canada, and knowing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few Canadians extremely well, including a few former girlfreinds, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would say that the main reason Canada is so peaceful is, and you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to call me racist or something for this, is because it is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; compared to the US, so ethnically homogenous. Minorities are extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt; minorities in Canada, for the most part, and have been that way for so</i><br>
<i>&gt; long that Canadians have never felt threatened or needed to feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; xenophobic, except possibly toward native Canadians, or between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; French and English speaking populations.</i><br>
<p>
I think your concept of an ethnically homogenous Canada either comes from<br>
only seeing certain parts of Canada, or from the lack of<br>
African-Canadians.  Most African-Canadians come from the underground<br>
railroad, as Canada was the first colony to abolish slavery; however, many<br>
other ethicities are highly represented.  Where I'm from (Vancouver), the<br>
asian population is massive (there are many reasons for this, including<br>
the exodus from Hong Kong)  At my university, as a person of<br>
Western-European desecent, *I* am a minority.  So, this explanation for<br>
the lack of violence doesn't hold water.  I don't buy the whole slavery<br>
thing as an explanation either-- Roman society was built by enslaving the<br>
population of conquered countries then incorporating those slaves into<br>
society as free citizens... the result was a very stable empire.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is changing, though, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidenced by the increases in the asian and islamic populations and</i><br>
<i>&gt; concurrent rises in crime in the areas where these minorities are</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentrated.</i><br>
<p>
I'm very sceptical of that.  There has been an increase in crime in<br>
Vancouver, but it is minimal, and there is a very good explanation for it:<br>
Vietnam has decided that they can't afford to imprison their criminals so<br>
instead they ship them out of the country... guess where they end up?<br>
Here, of course.  Canada needs to do something about its immigration<br>
laws... Vietnamese gangs are beginning to be a bit of a problem.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; ANother big factor I can't identify in words, but it is definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; related to the Canadian psyche and is possibly the same reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt; during the American Revolution, the Canadians did not join in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolt.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I agree fully.  I think the best explanation for the violence of the<br>
US compared to Canada is culture.  Americans began their country by<br>
fighting, Canadians just waited it out until we were *given* independence.<br>
Which was the better strategy?  Who cares, but the point is that this is a<br>
reflection of cultural differences (which I think are slowly blurring)<br>
One important motivator for Canadians to avoid violence is that many<br>
Canadians pride themselves on being as un-American as they can, and most<br>
Canadians see Americans as violent (just look at all the movies that come<br>
out of Hollywood!)  Hopefully, the Canadian tendency towards nonviolent<br>
solutions will rub off on the US, and the US tendency to prize individual<br>
liberty will rub off on Canada, as the walls of nationalism slowly break<br>
down.  I'm not much of a nationalist/patriot.  I'm proud to be a citizen<br>
of the universe... call me a universalist!<br>
