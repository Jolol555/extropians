Ok. I see the problem. So you hardly save anything (fuel) by starting from<br>
100 km. This means thus, that everything will automatically float/fall back<br>
to earth.<br>
<p>

thrown<br>

they<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ok. If I'm correct we move approx. 2000 km per hour with the earth.<br>
Is it possible, instead of making a cable on to a astroid, that we bring<br>
up the contra weight ourselves ? I hope I can explain it a bit better.<br>
<p>
Just imagine that the soda-straw-tower works.<br>
The first part is held up by big balloons, until X-km, or if<br>
this does not work, by some other pressure. At "some" point<br>
the spinning (rotation of earth) from the weight "takes-over" ? <br>
If I look at your figures, maybe I think to small !<br>
<p>
What height would be sufficient ? into orbit ? or can we do<br>
with a smaller tower. I mean by sufficient, a height were we<br>
could have a working-space, to build rockets an other things.<br>
Is it hard to calculate at what perfect height, what perfect contra<br>
weight is needed to keep up the tower, and allow an elevator trough?<br>
<p>
If I look it the simple way: when I turn around with a cord, I only need<br>
a very small weight at the end of it to keep the cord as a straight line.<br>
<p>
The question above, is of cause without the winds !<br>
<p>
Kennita: what I don't understand is, why when it's length is <br>
going up, the same has to be true for the diameter. Do you need<br>
this for the strength? <br>
Also, what do you think of the "open"-structure.<br>
Is that still not wind-proof :-)<br>
I can't imagine the forces on the structure, but isn't there any<br>
material today that could be woven to a "net", that can stand<br>
these winds. Is it also a particular height, were these winds are<br>
at top-speed. ?<br>
<p>
What I find very hard to grasp. Is were the Air is so light, you/things<br>
are weightless, is this gradually building up from the surface of the <br>
earth, or are you at some magical point weightless ?<br>
I know this last one can't be the case, but picturing it :-)<br>
<p>
It's a bit double, when I think you/things have enough height,<br>
I forget about the gravity, and when I think of escaping gravity, I think<br>
to easily that your in space (so, you are weightless) and therefor<br>
nothing is pulling you back. Which as I start to learn isn't so.<br>
I try to project visual (in my head) all the different influences on the<br>
tower, to<br>
understand how it works up there.<br>
<p>
Thanks again for all the help, I guess these contributions are not<br>
really what a lot of you are looking for in this list. But being new<br>
to extropy/transhumanism and with an average understanding of<br>
science, it's hard for newbies to get a grip at this movement.<br>
Maybe you should think of an entry-test :-)<br>

PS: we are working very hard in the Netherlands at the moment on<br>
the Excedo (&gt;H-foundation). And yes, we do have some <br>
people aboard with some descent scientific knowledge :-)<br>
