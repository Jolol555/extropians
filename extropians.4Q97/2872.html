<i>&gt;On the market, different agents bet that their own knowledge of the situation</i><br>

average of the<br>
<i>&gt;bids.  An efficient/rational system, by definition, is one that uses all its </i><br>

price<br>

<i>&gt;knowledge together (otherwise any dispute could be replaced by gambling).</i><br>
<i>&gt;So the market cannot be rational?  Or maybe it can be fixed by the traders </i><br>
<i>&gt;betting on some particular aspects of the market - the ones they actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim to understand.  For example, instead of having meteorologists and trade</i><br>
<i>&gt;analysts bet against each other based on their partial knowledge of the</i><br>
situation,<br>
<i>&gt;meteorologists could put forward statements like "I bet that the floods</i><br>
will not<br>
<i>&gt;destroy more than 5% of the crops this year", while the trade analysts</i><br>
will say<br>
<i>&gt;something like "I bet that if the floods do not happen at all, the</i><br>
government will<br>
<i>&gt;stockpile 10 million tons of the product".  Then, everybody would put</i><br>
their bets<br>
<i>&gt;on what they know, without the risk of losing money from the reasons beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;their competence, and the resulting prediction would not only be more</i><br>
balanced,<br>
<i>&gt;but will include a model of the expected market behavior.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I wonder if something like this has been tried or researched.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Something like this already occurs in the financial markets.<br>
You can buy bonds with the coupon intact, or you can strip the<br>
coupon from the bond and buy just the pieces.  Similarly, there<br>
is a large market in exotic swaps and derivatives, some of which<br>
are customized to match the characteristics that a particular<br>
buyer wishes to address.<br>
<p>
You should also realize that sometimes people bet not because<br>
they have "better knowledge" but simply to hedge their positions<br>
from unfavorable circumstances which they cannot predict well.<br>
