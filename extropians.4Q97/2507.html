<i>&gt;Right answer for who??? If you want a safe efficient little car,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you should pay for the cost of the added safety. DOn't put the</i><br>
<i>&gt;burden on me. So I should sacrifice my right to good vehicle</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance just so you in your dinky little rice burner don't get</i><br>
<i>&gt;flattened when you cut me off?? Sorry, not gonna happen.</i><br>
<p>
First of all , I'm not putting any burden on you, nor asking you to<br>
sacrifice. I was quoting a study. What you drive is your concern,<br>
not mine, and I will defend your right to do the same.<br>
<p>
Second of all, at 6'6" and 300lbs, it would have to be at least a<br>
"medium sized rice burner."  ;) <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's accelerating performance. To disprove the usefulness of</i><br>
<i>&gt;this quote, take a 98 lb weakling in the end zone of a football</i><br>
<i>&gt;field. Take a 240 lb linebacker in the opposite end zone. Have</i><br>
<i>&gt;them accelerate to full speed, and hit each other head on. Who do</i><br>
<i>&gt;you think is going to be more seriously hurt????</i><br>
<p>
I think your being slightly rhetorical here since Physics 101 would<br>
suggest both would be killed/crippled. This would be the equivalent<br>
of welding 2 York 45lb plates a 5lb and a 2 and 1/2 pound plate<br>
together (okay only 97.5 pounds) and dropping them on your<br>
linebackers head at 32ft persec persec from how high?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;At what cost????</i><br>
<p>
HTTP://www.rmi.org/hypercars/osaka/<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sure one hit and you throw the entire car away. A metal body can</i><br>
<i>&gt;be easily bent back to shape at a body shop in many accidents.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is another reason why insurance rates are going up. A higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;percentage of vehicles in accidents are declared total losses than</i><br>
<i>&gt;when metal was the norm.</i><br>
<p>
composite panels are not seriously damaged at even moderate speeds.<br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, as we were originally comparing IC vs EV, and I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to compare apples to apples (production IC vs. production</i><br>
<i>&gt;EV) and you went off on the hyperbody digression, which is all</i><br>
<i>&gt;very good and all, but you have yet to:</i><br>
<p>
We have a difference of type here, there has only been one real<br>
production EV to date, the recent entry by GM. I considerate it a<br>
very bad first prototype. "The regular car with an electric motor,<br>
and a stack of batteries" is a bad idea,the new Toyota which is<br>
just a regular car with a hybrid APU isn't much better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; a) show any comparative studies between advanced construction,</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultralightweight small cars hitting a moose or equivalent object,</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a current Chevy Suburban or Grand Cherokee, or my brothers</i><br>
<i>&gt;1/2 ton pickup truck. No matter what studies you cite, you still</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't dispute the 98 lb track runner vs. 240 lb. football lineman</i><br>
<i>&gt;collision, which is the easiest demonstration of what I am talking</i><br>
<i>&gt;about.</i><br>
<p>
There have been a number of studies done as mentioned in my second<br>
post on this including a number with the GM Ultralites, they do<br>
better than conventional cars and better than some sport utility<br>
vehicles, I don't remember if the specific vehicles you mentioned<br>
were in the paper I read.<br>
<p>
I addressed your football player analogy above, but lets return to<br>
the moose one last time. (poor moose)<br>
<p>
The moose is 1100lbs, but 90% of it's mass is 4ft+ off the ground,<br>
(high center of gravity) to borrow your football analogy your moose<br>
is going to get chop-blocked by my low slung Hypercar...<br>
<p>
Since by law in NH I can't salvage the meat, I hope at least it<br>
will be given to the poor. After contacting the proper authorities,<br>
I would be happy to help salvage it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;b) An IC with a similarly constructed body would exact the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiency gains from it as an EV power train would, so using such</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction to increase the efficiency of EVs apples and oranges.</i><br>
<p>
Even a poorly constructed prototype gets better than twice the<br>
performance/efficiency, see reference above. Advanced versions may<br>
get 10 times the efficency.<br>
<p>
The good news is that Rocky Mountain Institutes original paper is<br>
now a 450 page proprietary analysis that goes for 10K a copy (okay<br>
that's not the good news) it has also established the "Hypercar<br>
center" and the big three commitment is approaching 2 billion.<br>
Saturn is rumored to be already at work on it's first.<br>
<p>
I'll get my Hypercar, and Michael can keep his truck, or maybe get<br>
a better one.<br>
<p>
Peace<br>
