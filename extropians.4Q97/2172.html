I like this idea.  Here's a couple more:<br>
<p>
Have a webpage index of members listing their skills, resumes and<br>
services offered.  This could be like the restricted list, readable by<br>
the public, but only members can be on it.  If this would take too many<br>
resources, then perhaps just a single page index of members with a link<br>
to members' private web pages.<br>
<p>
ExI should also sell advertising space on its web page.  Listings of<br>
Extropian services, either of interest to Extropians, or offerred by<br>
Extropians, would be of interest to visiters to that page.  This<br>
hopefully would be a good form of advertising, and thus should earn good<br>
revenues for ExI.<br>
<p>
Maybe the extended advertising would be a pay service, available to<br>
nonmembers as well, while the individual web pages or links would be a<br>
member service.<br>
<p>
The Mutual Fund idea gave me these ideas.  I would like to see an<br>
Extropian financial advisor available.  And why not and Extropian<br>
doctor, lawyer, writer, web-designer, philosopher, artist, etc?<br>
