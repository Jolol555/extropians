            <br>
<p>
But that's not "backwards", it's a much easier way to go. There is only one <br>
output a complex mechanism can produce, so finding it, that is, understanding  <br>
it, could be very difficult. On the other hand, there are an infinite number  <br>
of ways a given output could be produced and you only need to find one of<br>
them, that one will be the one that is easiest to understand. Nanotechnology <br>
is different than life in that respect because life never used a simple <br>
solution if a complex  one was available.<br>

<i>        &gt;creature's phenotype. In nanotech we'll be starting from scratch </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Starting from scratch can be an advantage.  Life is a mess, the reason <br>
intelligent beings have such trouble figuring out how it operates is that it <br>
was not made by intelligence, and it shows. Life's inscrutability does not <br>
demonstrate good design but the reverse, an elegant program written by a <br>
master programmer is easier to understand than a mountain of turgid spaghetti <br>
code from a no talent hack. <br>
<p>
Random mutation and natural selection is not conducive to elegance in design  <br>
or ease of comprehension. The trouble with evolution is that it has no  <br>
foresight. With evolution EVERY step (generation) no matter how many MUST be <br>
an immediate improvement over the previous one. It can't think more than one<br>
step ahead, it doesn't understand one step backward two steps forward.<br>
  <br>
Fortunately people are smarter than that, so If the tire on your car is <br>
getting worn you can take it off and put a new one on, but evolution could <br>
never do anything that simple, because when you take the old tire off you <br>
have temporally made things worse, now you have no tire at all. True, nature <br>
would eventually come up with a solution to the worn tire problem, but you <br>
can be sure it would be of byzantine complexity.<br>
<p>
We already had prop engines for airplanes and then somebody came up with a <br>
completely new idea that used very different basic principles, it worked <br>
better  and in just a few years they had made a working jet engine. Other <br>
people could understand the engine and soon everybody was making them. <br>
Imagine if you tried to do that natures way. I give you a prop engine and <br>
tell you to improve it, but you must do it while the engine is running, you <br>
must do it in ten million small steps, and you must do it so that every one <br>
of those steps immediately improves the operation of the engine. After a few <br>
million years you'd get an improved engine of some sort, but it wouldn't be a  <br>
jet, it would be a plumbers nightmare, and you'd have a hell of a time trying  <br>
to explain to somebody else how it worked or even in remembering exactly how <br>
you built the damn thing.                  <br>
