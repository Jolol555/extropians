I'm forwarding this to you, I think you'll find it *fascinating*!<br>

For all you sci-fi buffs out there, where I work, the American Institute of<br>
Physics, has just put out the most incredible press release.  Teleportation<br>
has been achieved!  It's only on a photon, but they figured out how to<br>
bypass Heisenberg's Uncertainly Principle to transfer the properties of a<br>
quantum particle from one location to another.  And, since the process<br>
happens on the quantum level, it is instantaneous (as in faster-than-light!)<br>
 Now another part of the process right now has to take place at light<br>
speed, so it's not FTL communication yet, but the core of the process is<br>
FTL.  They believe they will be able to make the process work on atoms<br>
within three years, molecules with 10 years.  This is truly a remarkable<br>
step forward.  If you want to see a diagram and read more about it, go<br>

<p>
If you want details, here's a press release:<br>
<p>
QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally demonstrated by<br>
physicists at the University<br>
of Innsbruck (Anton Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@<br>
uibk.ac.at; Dik Bouwmeester,<br>
Dik.Bouwmeester@uibk.ac.at). First proposed in 1993 by Charles<br>
Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118),<br>
quantum teleportation allows physicists to take a photon (or any other<br>
quantum-scale particle, such as an<br>
atom), and transfer its properties (such as its polarization) to another<br>
photon--even if the two photons are<br>
on opposite sides of the galaxy. Note that this scheme transports the<br>
particle's properties to the remote<br>
location and not the particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk,<br>
whose body is destroyed at the<br>
teleporter and reconstructed at his destination, the state of the original<br>
photon must be destroyed to<br>
create an exact reconstruction at the other end. In the Innsbruck<br>
experiment, the researchers create a<br>
pair of photons A and B that are quantum mechanically "entangled": the<br>
polarization of each photon is in<br>
a fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely<br>
defined interrelationship. If one photon<br>
is later measured to have, say, a horizontal polarization, then the other<br>
photon must "collapse" into the<br>
complementary state of vertical polarization. In the experiment, one of the<br>
entangled photons A arrives at<br>
an optical device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose<br>
polarization state is to be teleported.<br>
These two photons enter a device where they become indistinguishable,<br>
thus effacing our knowledge of<br>
M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying Kirk).What the researchers<br>
have verified is that by ensuring<br>
that M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization would<br>
now have to assume the same<br>
value as M's. In other words, although M and B have never been in<br>
contact, B has been imprinted with<br>
M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy, instantaneously. This<br>
does not mean that faster-than-light<br>
information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station<br>
must still convey the fact that<br>
teleportation had been successful by making a phone call or using some<br>
other light-speed or<br>
sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't foresee<br>
the possibility of teleporting<br>
large-scale objects like humans, this scheme will have uses in quantum<br>
computing and cryptography.<br>
<p>
Cool, huh?<br>
