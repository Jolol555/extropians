<i>&gt; of one off the top of my head).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about a language with no representations of past, present, and future?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That said, I think that English speakers are among the least constrained</i><br>

<i>&gt; We do, however, seem to have problems with melodic and clicking</i><br>
<i>&gt; languages.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Good points, I usually just use (or abuse) the language without<br>
thinking about it. However, I was thinking more in terms of<br>
linguistic constraints that map into the way our human brains<br>
are  wired. We are now confronting the near-term possibility<br>
of remodelling our brains, via uploading or computer augmentation.<br>
Will we need new linguistic constructs to use the new hardware<br>
effectively? can we get some idea of what we need before the<br>
hardware is available. This is roughly analogous to designing<br>
a new higher-level computer language in conjunction with a<br>
new processor.<br>
