I'd think that the easiest fix would be to start building chips in three<br>
dimensions, as cubes. Of course, they'll have to build in passive<br>
temperature controls, though possibly active systems built at the micron<br>
level might be a good first boost to mass nano machinery production.<br>
<p>
Of course, then, they'd have to to license the Borg(tm) name from<br>
Paramount as a trade name for the processor.<br>
