                  REVIEW OF THE INTERNET  by Jane Affleck<br>
                  =======================================<br>

                  <br>
Here is a selection of sites on the Internet that I have found interesting. <br>
However, it is only a very small selection, and is not intended to be in any<br>
way comprehensive, but only to give some indication of the type of information<br>
available (with some bias towards those areas that may interest Lobster<br>
readers).  Other points worth making: using the internet can be very time<br>
consuming - and expensive - if you don't know what you're looking for, and<br>
access can be variable, being very slow, or even impossible to connect, at busy<br>
times.  The usenet newsgroups are for discussion of issues and anyone can<br>
contribute;  some of the contibutions are pretty far out, or just plain<br>
abusive, and much of the material is US-orientated.  The content of newsgroups<br>
is continually changing, and the examples I have given are of topics listed<br>
recently.  However, there is a lot of useful and interesting information out<br>
there, as I hope the following will indicate.<br>
<p>

hundreds of antennas capable of directing an intense beam of electromagnetic<br>
energy into the ionosphere.  Scientists and environmentalists are concerned<br>
that HAARP's electronic transmitters could harm people and trigger unforeseen<br>
environmental and atmospheric effects; also conspiracy theories about mind<br>
control and climatic war.<br>

atmospheric nuclear devices, that HAARP could wipe out communications over a<br>
very large area, replace the ELF submarine communication system, that HAARP<br>
could help detect incoming low level planes and cruise missiles, and help<br>
verify nuclear  non-proliferation. (Quotes a White House adviser in 1958 as<br>
saying the US defence department was studying ways to manipulate the charges of<br>
the earth and sky and so affect the weather by using an electronic beam to<br>
ionise or de-ionise the atmosphere over a given area).<br>
