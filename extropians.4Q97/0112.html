One idea which is a bit analogous to cryptography is to try to lose<br>
yourself in the vastness of interstellar space.  As the singularity<br>
approaches, it may be possible to outfit a small spaceship with enough<br>
resources to keep you and perhaps some other people alive, or at least<br>
preserved.  You then leave earth and head out at some random direction.<br>
You'd need to make the direction choice such that it could not be<br>
predicted by the later Singularity.  Maybe some kind of chaotic<br>
interaction with the Oort cloud could leave you with a random direction<br>
where all the information about which way you went has been thermalized.<br>
<p>
You'd also have to be going fast enough so that by the time the<br>
Singularity happens and it comes after you, the volume of space where<br>
you could be is big enough (cubic light years, ideally).  This requires<br>
a significant fraction of the speed of light.<br>
<p>
The reason why it could be hard to find you is that the Singularity has<br>
only the resources of the solar system to work with (at least initially).<br>
Realistically they will only put a tiny fraction of that into looking<br>
for you.  This is a very limited amount of matter, and even if they<br>
converted it all into spaceships and sent them out looking for you,<br>
space is so big that they wouldn't come very close.  This is why it's<br>
like crypto, because it's easy for you to choose a random direction<br>
(like a random key) but to find you they have to check every direction<br>
(like a brute force search for every key).<br>
<p>
Of course you'd have to consider what kind of sensor technology could be<br>
used to detect a small spaceship from far away.  I don't really know<br>
how hard it would be to spot you.<br>
<p>
Even if this hides you, it doesn't fully satisfy Wei's requirement because<br>
it doesn't leave you in a very good situation after the Singularity burns<br>
out (or whatever happens to it).  Maybe your ship could have an engine<br>
and you could return to earth after some number of years.  It's not<br>
clear how you'd know what it was safe, though.<br>
