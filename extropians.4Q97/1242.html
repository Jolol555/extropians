<i>&gt; So Ian, what changed your mind?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: I wish it didn't matter. When I got this <br>
new address (the last server hosting my domain <br>
was screwed),  I was hoping it marked a new<br>
beginning, a place I could "disappear" from <br>
the furry of my conspiracy inquiry. Then <br>
the CIA, I mean CNN, called...<br>
<p>
After they ran the story, every news agency on <br>
Earth was calling. I could not believe it. The<br>
CNN reporter said it was determined that I was<br>
the  causal locus of the  continuation of the <br>
Navy-missile theory.  I know my research was<br>
persuading people at high levels of society.<br>
But I did not invent the thing, nor did I <br>
discover any new piece of evidence, it's<br>
all a matter of effective presentation,<br>
of effective memetic propagation.<br>
<p>
That's why they hit me so hard. I must be <br>
destroyed, even if I've backed off, reeling <br>
from all the blows. I'm a marked man. I want<br>
to be unmarked and to stop my "wrong inquiry."<br>
<p>
The military Intel-Op who monitors my Internet<br>
posting had sent CNN the post that they quoted,<br>
and he told them it was an admission of fraud.<br>
CNN was going to run the excerpt from my post<br>
to the TWA 800 list, and asked if I'd admitted <br>
to fraud in it. I said "not at all" and pointed <br>
out the portions where I indicate that spreading<br>
fear is appropriate "if founded."  I also said <br>
that failing to note that portion would give <br>
the wrong impression. So guess what CNN did?<br>
What does that tell you they wanted to do?<br>
<p>
CNN wanted a video interview. They were going<br>
to send a camera crew down from New York to<br>
Maryland. I can't believe it. I said no. They<br>
would not take no for an answer, but I stuck<br>
to my guns. I know from the past how they cut<br>
you up to say what they want. They also wanted<br>
a voice interview, I also said no to that. <br>
I still can't believe any of this. <br>
<p>
<p>
Knowing that all my Internet communications are<br>
monitored (I know it sounds paranoid, but when <br>
it's true, it's true; when they are out to get <br>
you, they are),  I want to say that I've made <br>
the effort to end my war on the Establishment.<br>
I really want to stop and turn over a new leaf,<br>
I shut down my webpage on September 11, 1997.<br>
I even gracefully signed and handed over my <br>
"surrender papers." But the Establishment <br>
then "guns me down" anyway.  They are <br>
literally terrified of me. But I'll stop<br>
<p>
if they'll stop<br>
<p>
The false story implying I admitted fraud has <br>
reached virtually every media source in the <br>
Western world, TV, radio, and press. Rush <br>
Limbaugh (a close friend of James Kallstrom<br>
heading the FBI's TWA 800 investigation) was<br>
railing on against me, as if I was Satan in-<br>
carnate. This was an unprecedented full-court<br>
effort to destroy one man for the crime of <br>
questioning the FBI's TWA 800 investigation.<br>
<p>
They could have just said, "He said he was <br>
sorry, and he made a mistake," and I would <br>
have never said another word. But no, they <br>
had to frame me up as a fraud, they had to <br>
try to kill me. You don't shot a man with a <br>
surrender flag. What kind of people are they?<br>
<p>
But what I want them to know is that I still<br>
want to move on. I don't want to or plan to <br>
write anything new against the Establishment,<br>
ever again, if they will just leave me alone.<br>
