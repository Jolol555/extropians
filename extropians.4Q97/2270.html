A few months ago The Learning Channel (or The Discovery Channel, watch<br>
both, get them confused at times) had a special on the future of<br>
automobiles.  Granted, this was a TV documentary but...<br>
<p>
1)  The best electric cars developed currently pollutes more than the<br>
new breed of internal combustion engines.  This pollution is mainly from<br>
the gases produced by the batteries.  (They also noted that the disposal<br>
of used-up batteries would be a more ecological hazard than anyone has<br>
yet been willing to contemplate.)<br>
<p>
2)  The new internal combustion engines produce LESS pollution than<br>
mandated as minimal by the California pollution laws.  Amazingly, the<br>
electric cars exceed or just barely reach this level.<br>
<p>
3)  90%+ of the pollution of new internal combustion engines occurs in<br>
the first 5 minutes of operation, before the engine/catalytic converter<br>
gets up to operating temperature.  Electric engines pollute at a<br>
constant rate.<br>
<p>
4)  Gasoline is a by-product of oil refining.  It was actually dumped<br>
into the ground in the early days before the advent of a need<br>
(automobiles).  We will always need to get rid of gasoline somehow until<br>
we no longer refine oil.<br>
<p>
5)  The scenario about the pollution and secondary trauma from an<br>
electric car accident was enough to turn your stomach.  Granted, I<br>
suppose batteries COULD be developed that could survive a 60 mph<br>
crash....or powerful enough that you wouldn't need several hundred<br>
pounds of them.<br>
<p>
Granted, we refine more oil for gasoline purposes today than we need<br>
from other refinery products.  Yes we should find alternative propulsion<br>
methods.  What this shows to me is yet another emotionally charged<br>
fringe group (anti-oil, luddites, anti-technology, etc) with the power<br>
to enact laws of the land affecting everyone without using a little<br>
logic and common sense.  <br>
<p>
I'll be glad to purchase an alternative to my internal-combustion<br>
propelled automobile when one is developed that is better, not just<br>
different.<br>
<p>
Of course, we HAD an alternative years ago.  Just about every city of<br>
size had excellent small-rail systems.  These were bought up, ran into<br>
ruin, and ripped out.  Bring back decent mass transit (busses just don't<br>
make it as they don't go where I need when I need and pollute more than<br>
a thousand cars) and you eliminate the need for individual transport.<br>
We can still have our automobiles, we just won't use them nearly as<br>
much.<br>

		And we will.  If 90% of our oil reserves were to be<br>
suddenly gone, I <br>
	suspect we would rapidly make adjustments.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; Yes, better to use them for plastics and composite materials.</i><br>
<i>	&gt; So how are electric cars doing? I understand Ford has a model</i><br>
that is <br>
	ready<br>
<i>	&gt; to be _used_.</i><br>
<p>
		I've always wondered if people that favored electric<br>
cars so much realize <br>
	how toxic batteries are, and that the electric plant burns coal<br>
to generate <br>
	the electricity to power them.<br>
<p>
		Being in tune with the auto industry (here in Detroit,<br>
it's tough to avoid <br>
	it), Ford has a car.  It carries a boatload of batteries (toxic<br>
waste).  It <br>
	hits a top speed of 10 miles an hour, and needs to be recharged<br>
every 30 <br>
	minutes.  Or something, I must admit I cannot recall the exact<br>
details. <br>
	 Generally speaking, it couldn't replace the average<br>
gas-guzzling, <br>
	smoke-belching, rust-bucket of doom.<br>
