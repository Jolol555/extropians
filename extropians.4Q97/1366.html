It should be controversial, as it not terribly accurate.  It has long been<br>
recognized that the major variable in family size is mortality -- if a<br>
woman has to have a dozen kids to have a decent chance of two or three<br>
surviving to reproduce, than she has to have a dozen kids, lest her genes<br>
vanish from the pool.  Without changing her environment, the supremely<br>
educated woman would be facing exactly the same situation -- and would have<br>
to birth a dozen kids (or give up the race).<br>
<p>
In an environment where all of her kids have a good chance of living long<br>
enough to reproduce, even the least educated woman will have fewer kids, as<br>
the reproductive advantage goes to those who give their kids a better<br>
launch in life by not splitting their resources too many ways.<br>
<p>
In a society where social improvements are being implemented rapidly<br>
(sewers, education, public medicine, etc.), educating women about the<br>
effect on mortality rate that these improvements are likely to have can<br>
speed up the process of family size reduction (so it doesn't take a full<br>
generation for people to realize that their kids are likely to live to<br>
reproductive age), but it is not the cause of the reduction.<br>
<p>
Education, while a good idea for all (and not just for *women*), cannot<br>
stop population growth.  If education gets in the way of reproduction,<br>
mother nature interprets it as damage, and routes around it.  ;-)<br>
