One of the greatest problems facing Humanity is the spread of infectious<br>
diseases.  This has always been a problem, and it has the potential to be<br>
quite devastating in the present and future as people pack more tightly<br>
together in cities and as single individuals come into close proximity<br>
with more and more other people every day.  If one person has an<br>
infectious disease, they can easily expose a hundred other people, who go<br>
on to expose others to the disease.  Most of these diseases are fairly<br>
minor, like the common cold, strep throat, etc, but some are quite<br>
deadly, like Ebola.  These diseases have the potential to interfere<br>
greatly with the productivity of humans at best and to destroy large<br>
numbers of people at worst.<br>
<p>
What if humans developed a procedure which could detect most or all known<br>
infectious diseases in a human that was fairly fast (&lt; 2 hours) and<br>
fairly inexpensive (&lt; US $100)?  Is such a procedure possible?  What<br>
would be the consequences of its availability?<br>
<p>
One obvious consequence is that when humans traveled to different<br>
countries, Customs, while ensuring the humans are not smuggling anything<br>
illegal into their country, will also make sure they are not smuggling in<br>
any infectious diseases.<br>
<p>
Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens<br>
to be screened for disease periodically.  How often would depend mostly<br>
on the cost of the procedure, since disease control would be more<br>
effective if people were screened more often, although there would be a<br>
point at which more frequent screenings would not be any more effective. <br>
Some may consider the diseases they harbor a matter of privacy and decry<br>
the governments' actions, while others (I believe the majority) will<br>
consider it a public safety issue and believe that no one has the right<br>
to (knowingly or unknowingly) infect others with deadly or debilitating<br>
diseases.<br>
<p>
Then there is the question of what to do with people who have been found<br>
to have a highly infectious, deadly disease, or how to deal with people<br>
who have an infectious disease, such as the common cold, whose symptoms<br>
are not deadly but are very unpleasant and prevent one from being able to<br>
work and earn money for a period of time.  Should people with these<br>
diseases be allowed to leave their houses? Should they be confined in<br>
hospitals?  By infecting others, they are imposing a real financial cost<br>
on them, and it could be argued successfully that sick people are not<br>
legally entitled to associate with others who don't choose to associate<br>
with them, until they are rid of the infectious disease.  Although,<br>
enforcing this would be difficult.<br>
<p>
Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas<br>
for achieving this goal?  <br>
<p>
