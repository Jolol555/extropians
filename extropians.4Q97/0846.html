<i>&gt; instead of cowering in front of computer monitors (I've just</i><br>

<p>
I agree. It is important for personal development to experience the<br>
sensual side of life. We are sensual beings, and most of our mental<br>
architecture is based on that. Even if we autoevolve a lot, I would be<br>
surprised if we would loose this aspect, it is very deeply ingrained<br>
in our fundamental structure. Of course, we might gain new senses and<br>
ways of experiencing the wonders of the world, some of which may today<br>
be regarded as distinctly non-sensual such as internet traffic or the<br>
radio spectrum.<br>

<i>&gt; (Do I personally - for what such reflections are worth - *get out more*?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do I myself  have a life?  A rather more stifled life than I'd wish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly, more constricted than I'd like it to be.  I live alone these</i><br>
<i>&gt; days, but I'm not persuaded  that reading a lot and writing books and</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking with you cyberspace folks, sharing my conjectures and reading and</i><br>
<i>&gt; puns, is an *alternative* to reality.  It's part of reality, perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt; redemptive and expansive part.  I don't find many compatible people out</i><br>
<i>&gt; there in the street, or even in the university when I occasionally pedal</i><br>
<i>&gt; over to the campus.  But doesn't the literal narrowness of the e-channel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; its asynchronous theatricality, factor into the appeal of living part of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; life on-line?  Of course.   Does this mean my original reaction to Wax's</i><br>
<i>&gt; cliched jibe was transparently self-defensive?   Gosh, I *never thought of</i><br>
<i>&gt; that*.  [Get a life, Sigmund.])</i><br>
<p>
:-) Most conventional people would definitely say that I haven't got a<br>
life. I spend most of my waking time reading, working at a computer or<br>
talking with people. I rarely go to movies, I never go out for dancing<br>
and I don't drink alcohol. Instead I play roleplaying games, lecture<br>
at the young scientist association or a local highschool and discuss<br>
with my friends. I'm almost the archetypal nerd.<br>
<p>
But I'm profoundly happy too. The rather cerebral world I inhabit is<br>
filled with wonders, ranging from the grand beauty of dynamical<br>
systems theory and neural networks to the fun of developing new ideas<br>
to see how well they float. I learn things all the time, I discover<br>
things about myself and the world every day. My email discussion<br>
channels may be serial, in black and white, with no body language or<br>
other non-verbal clues, but they still manage what I regard as the<br>
most precious things in the universe: ideas, communication and<br>
information.<br>
<p>
Do I really need to "get out more"? Obviously, it is a good idea to<br>
experience new things, to open up new areas of skill and possibility,<br>
but I don't see any reason why it is more valuable to move in the<br>
physical or social world than in the intellectual world. Balance<br>
doesn't mean that one should devote exactly one third of one's time to<br>
each of these worlds, it means that one should find the right ratios<br>
to achieve personal satisfaction and development.<br>
