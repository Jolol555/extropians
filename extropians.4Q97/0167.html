<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually I find that the Singularity stays about 20-30 years in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future.  I'd like to see some evidence that anyone in 1980 predicted it</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the Singularity back then.</i><br>
<p>
Going from memory (books lent out):<br>
Vernor Vinge gave birth to the concept in 1979.<br>
The first calculation with respect to human-equivalent AI was performed by<br>
Hans Moravec and gave a result of 2035.  I believe this was 1980 or<br>
thereabouts, although it could be 1984.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 20-30 years is enough time for significant changes in technology and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in society.  When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; could occur in that time frame.  In fact, technology has not advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; as fast as was expected back then, at least not in those areas.  AI has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been 20-30 years away since the 1950's.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but that was wild optimism, not an extrapolation based on previous rates<br>
of progress.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.</i><br>
<p>
Yawn.  Copper circuits, qubits, quantum transistors, STM, nanotech, diamond<br>
disk drives, parallel processing, networked computing, etc, etc, ad Singularitum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can</i><br>
<i>&gt; guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined</i><br>
<i>&gt; to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though</i><br>
<i>&gt; things often take much longer than we expect.</i><br>
<p>
2008?  How safe is that?<br>
