<i>&gt; Obviously I agree that people are not words, but I strongly disagree with </i><br>

<p>
"Mental state" is a bit ambigous. I think the traditional line<br>
of thinking goes like this: The thought "Mary loves John." involves <br>
the same concepts as "John loves Mary.", namely the concepts "John", <br>
"loves" and "Mary". Nevertheless the two thoughts are quite distinct. <br>
So let's assume I agree that you are a mental state or a collection <br>
of them. You would then be constituted by a thought or a collection <br>
of thoughts. This means, if you hade very different thoughts, you <br>
would be a different person. Hence you are not defined by the <br>
concepts you entertain, since there are many very different ways in <br>
which these concepts could be put together into thoughts; and <br>
different thoughts would constitute a different person. So rather <br>
than saying that you are a collection of concepts, you have to say <br>
that you are a collection of conceps cum a structure defined on that <br>
collection. And I don't think it makes literal sense to say that this <br>
collection cum structure is an adjective -- it would be more correct <br>
to say that it was a proposition.<br>
<p>
At this point I may also ask you if you don't think that feelings and <br>
values and desires enters in what constitutes being you?<br>
<p>
Moreover, in order to be a human being, it is not enough to be a <br>
person. One also has to belong to the human species, and whether one <br>
does so presumably depends on one's ancestry and one's biological <br>
constitution, not just on one's thoughts or concepts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Also, note the interdefinability of nouns, adjectives and nouns, in         </i><br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;English: Dog=that which "dogs"=that which is "doggish".</i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, and it's almost enough to give circular reasoning a bad name. Actually  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think all it proves is that definitions are not all that important and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; except when doing mathematics or formal logic we seldom use them or need to.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, on some deeper level I think I agree with you there.<br>
