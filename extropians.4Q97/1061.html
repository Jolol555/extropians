<i>&gt; But the main question remains unanswered: does it have any useful</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (And no vague claims or anecdotal evidence please)</i><br>
<p>
That is indeed the question.  In my research there is little direct<br>
evidence for the effectiveness of Sound &amp; Light entrainment devices, but<br>
quite a bit of evidence for the effectiveness of Neurofeedback devices.<br>
<p>
For example, see the collection of papers &amp; abstracts at: <br>
<a href="http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi">http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi</a><br>
cine/Biofeedback.html<br>
<p>
and:<br>
<a href="http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi">http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi</a><br>
cine/Biofeedback/Neurofeedback.html<br>
<p>
or do a Medline search on "Neurofeedback".<br>
<p>
These studies collectively show a number of correlations between certain<br>
observed brainwave states (via EEG) and certain observed<br>
behavioral/physiological states.  Further they show that with training<br>
subjects can learn to directly modulate their own brainwave activity,<br>
and that this can have benefits in directing attention, augmenting<br>
visual ideation, controlling pain, eliminating stress, dealing with<br>
addiction, etc..<br>
<p>
Sadly studies to date have been focussed on eliminating "pathologies"<br>
such as Attention Deficit Disorder or addictive behavior and relatively<br>
little experimental work has been done on the potential of this<br>
technology for augmenting human capabilities beyond societal norms.<br>
<p>
However if I'm allowed to step into the realm of anecdotal evidence, er,<br>
I mean postulated models of attentional processing :), then I'd add the<br>
following points:<br>
<p>
* EEG measurements of those with a fair bit of training in Neurofeedback<br>
or a fair bit of experience with Mind Machines look quite similar to<br>
those of extremely experienced meditators, either in the Vipassana<br>
(insight) style of meditation, or the more-scientifically-studied<br>
tranquility meditations, such as Transcendental Meditation.<br>
<p>
* Some studies (I wish I could vouch for their accuracy - any comments<br>
from the peanut gallery?) have found an extremely large IQ boost in<br>
twice-daily practitioners of TM.  20 points on average if memory serves.<br>
<p>
<p>
* Among ADD sufferers, studies of neurofeedback protocols routinely show<br>
a 20-30 point IQ boost over a period of several months.<br>
<p>
I would hesitate to take any one of the studies that show such drastic<br>
benefits at face value, but similar results have been replicated by<br>
numerous researchers.  It's my hope that in the next few years we'll see<br>
more research focussed on using these technologies to augment "healthy"<br>
individuals rather than merely as corrective tools.<br>
<p>
Finally, to come back around to Mind Machines (Sound &amp; Light Entrainment<br>
Devices), I should say that while there is little in the way of<br>
published studies of their effectiveness, there apparently /is/ a<br>
well-documented entrainment effect where brainwave activity falls into<br>
cadence with rhythmic visual &amp; auditory stimuli.  The similarity between<br>
the effects &amp; observed EEGs of Neurofeedback subjects and meditators<br>
suggests that a third entrypoint to the same EEG state (such as a Mind<br>
Machine) would produce similar effects.<br>
<p>
While not all of us can afford an EEG at home, most of us can afford a<br>
small Mind Machine.  Net, I'd advise you to try one out, perhaps<br>
borrowing one before you buy, and experience for yourself how it affects<br>
you.<br>
