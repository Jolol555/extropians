Lee Daniel Crocker writes in response to my post:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Swiss psychotherapist Alice Miller's horrifying book on the subject </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of 'poisonous pedagogy' -- "'For Your Own Good':  The Roots of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Violence in Child-Rearing" (Virago, [1987] -- is an inclusive and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; comprehensive descriptive and explanatory account, which answers the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; basic question: "How would you have to bring up a child, for him or </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; her to be a violent adult?"</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyone who claims to come anywhere close to answering a question</i><br>
<i>&gt; like that can be immediately dismissed as a crackpot.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; so many completely unstudied and misunderstood aspects of learning,</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialization, genetic predisposition, and blind chance involved</i><br>
<i>&gt; in child-rearing that any claim of any "scientific" result in it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is utterly specious.</i><br>
<p>
      An extreme aprioristic response...  This person dismisses an <br>
      argument without understanding what it says, or evaluating its <br>
      accuracy.  Try studying Alice Miller's hypothesis first.  Then make <br>
      some testable deductions from it, and check them out against the <br>
      factual and statistical bases.<br>
      <br>
      In the UK, around 80% of people in prison are from State childrens' <br>
      homes.  Additionally: virtually everone convicted of violent <br>
      offences has had an appallingly violent childhood -- physical and/or <br>
      sexual and/or gross emotional abuse.<br>
      <br>
      Alice Miller's thesis seems to fit the facts very well.<br>
<p>
      We are not presented with a choice of 'explanation' _or_ 'too <br>
      complex to understand.'  We are presented with alternative <br>
      hypotheses. Alice Miller's hypotheses describe, explain and predict <br>
      violent behaviour very well.<br>
      <br>
      So, what alternative hypotheses do you offer?<br>
