       [1] A photon is absorbed and emitted by electrons as it passes <br>
       through a glass block.  The photon is decelerated, held, then <br>
       re-emitted. Unless you believe that instantaneous transition from <br>

       [2] Your mistake is in the focus on (mythical) 'observers' rather <br>
       than on objective reality.  If you plot the ineluctably necessary <br>

       see quite clearly that the relative velocities are often quite <br>

       and plot the intermediate positions and thence velocities.  Simple, <br>

I hope not, because if so that means logic must be inconsistent. We know <br>

      You fail to understand the problem, then.  Once you say that two <br>
      events are absolutely (not relativistically) simultaneous, you have <br>
      'position space.'  Special and General Relativity _cannot survive_ <br>
      the loss of relativististic simultaneity.  See Popper, "The <br>
      Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery" [1983] ferinstance, <br>
      for the exact arguments.  Popper argues that this would necessitate <br>
      a return to Lorentz.  Following R.A. Waldron [1977], Walter Ritz <br>
      [1908] etc., I argue it necessitates a return to the ballistic <br>
      theory of light, in a Galilean framework.<br>

<i>&gt;       &gt;velocity addition is clearly demonstrable as well as being logically         </i><br>

<i>&gt; Rubbish.</i><br>
<p>
      &lt;Sigh&gt;. OK, so you can't understand the problems with your own <br>

<i>&gt;       &gt;there is a constant process of absorption and re-emission as photons         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;travel from A to B         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The index of refraction is a measure of how much a substance will slow down </i><br>
<i>&gt; light, water is pretty dense so light is only about 80% as fast as in a  </i><br>
<i>&gt; vacuum for example. </i><br>
<p>
      Notice the absurdity you're slipping into there.  Water <br>
      (ferinstance) is tiny molecules enormously widely spaced.  The <br>
      charges and neutrons are tiny particles enormously widely spaced.The <br>
      space is a _perfect vacuum_ (except for the photons).  <br>
<p>
      Are your photons now travelling sub-luminally in a vacuum, pray?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;et. al.) is the cause of the cosmic (Hubble) redshift, which is of         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;course directly proportional to the distance stellar photons have to        </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;travel to get here.</i><br>
   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And now you enter the Twilight Zone. All elements produce a unique set </i><br>
<i>&gt; of emission and absorption lines in their electromagnetic spectrum, a </i><br>
<i>&gt; redshift means that the information on the  relative position of these </i><br>
<i>&gt; lines is preserved, they're just "shifted" to a longer wavelength. There </i><br>
<i>&gt; are only 2 things known to science that can produce a redshift:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) The Doppler effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Gravity. (an effect discovered by Einstein by the way)</i><br>
<p>
      Never seen a sunset?  Filters?  etc. etc. etc...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The huge redshift seen in distant galaxies does not produce fuzzy lines </i><br>
<i>&gt; but sharp ones, so the gravitational field would not only have to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; enormous but also constant over thousands of light years, over an entire </i><br>
<i>&gt; galaxy. Nothing known to science can produce a gravitational field like </i><br>
<i>&gt; that. It also seems very strange that the gravitational field of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; objects is proportional to their distance from a small planet called </i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth.</i><br>
<p>
      You're not a Kuhnian, are you?  Instead of addressing my arguments, <br>
      you insist on addressing your own!  I never suggested gravity as a <br>
      cause! &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You claim to have found a third way to produce a redshift, some sort of </i><br>
<i>&gt; mysterious inter galactic gas, well that's jim dandy, but until you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; show me the stuff and let me watch it do its thing in the lab your theory </i><br>
<i>&gt; remains just that, gas.</i><br>
<p>
      Now you've found some 'third ways' too!  And you can hardly deny the <br>
      presence of a 'cosmic soup' between the stars.  You've already <br>
      conceded its existence.<br>
<p>
         <br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;No way, Jose!  As Leibniz pointed out, the same facts can be         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;explained by an indefinitely large number  of different theories.        </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I sense desperation, I can't think of any other reason you would invoke </i><br>
<i>&gt; the name of a man dead for 300 years to dismiss with a wave of your hand </i><br>
<i>&gt; hard experimental data obtained in this very decade.</i><br>
<p>
      You must be sensing your own desperation, then.  I merely assigned <br>
      the appropriate priority to Leibniz -- try addressing the <br>
      problem-situation he raised, rather than how long ago he pointed out <br>
      this rather obvious and inescapable problem.  'Hard experimental <br>
      data' can no more refute his argument than your thumping the <br>
      table...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also note  that in my last post whenever I mentioned a scientific fact </i><br>
<i>&gt; in favor of the  Big Bang your only rebuttal was to tell me to read </i><br>
<i>&gt; books by various philosophers but that just doesn't wash. It's science </i><br>
<i>&gt; that must give marching orders to philosophy not the other way round.</i><br>
<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;    those naughty logical positivists loved it so much.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) The Big Bang did not become popular in the 60's.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) Despite the fact that The Big Bang theory was the only one that </i><br>
<i>&gt;    predicted universal blackbody microwave radiation and said how hot it </i><br>
<i>&gt;    would be, when evidence for it was actually found nobody was impressed </i><br>

 {X1} Mercury's Perihelion Advance<br>
      ============================<br>
<p>
     While it was for a long time the strongest argument for it, this is not<br>
now considered a corroboration of Einstein's theory.  There was an observed,<br>
long-standing and acknowledged anomaly between the classically predicted<br>
movement of the planet Mercury (circling the Sun in a nearly "closed" or<br>
stationary ellipse, with a small perihelion advance caused by the gravitation<br>
of the other planets) and the observed advance of the perihelion (Mercury's<br>
closest approach to the sun), a difference of 43 seconds of arc<br>
(approximately 0.012 of a degree) per century.  (Ritz's, Weber's and<br>
Neumann's theories of gravity as a propagated far-action also give<br>
approximately this result).<br>
<p>
     The existence of another - intraMercurial - planet, "Vulcan", was<br>
suggested as a cause, but no planet "Vulcan" was found (sorry, fellow "Star<br>
Trek" fans).  However, in 1970, the American astronomer Robert Henry Dicke<br>
suggested a (partial, 10%) classical cause for the anomaly as due to the<br>
oblateness of the Sun (a flattening at the poles caused by rotation).  And<br>
the force of gravitational attraction is only a uniform central force for<br>
orbits lying in the equatorial plane of the sun; Mercury's orbit lies 7<br>
degrees off the plane of the ecliptic.  The sun's equatorial rotation on its<br>
axis is 25.38 days; Mercury circles the Sun in 88 days.  The sun's magnetic<br>
force and atmosphere extends far past Mercury; so does the "solar wind."<br>
There is a rotating accretion disc of particles, gas and dust extending on<br>
the plane of the ecliptic from the sun.  The other planets affect Mercury's<br>
rotation.  Light-pressure from sunlight acts on the planets.<br>
<p>
     Most significantly; the sun's magnetic force transfers the Sun's angular<br>
momentum to Mercury; this will continue to advance Mercury's perihelion,<br>
until the Sun's angular velocity and Mercury's orbital velocity become more<br>
nearly synchronized.  Compare this with Larmor precession.<br>
<p>
     Since general relativity predicts an additional 45" +/-5 per century<br>
precession advance without allowing for any of these factors, it is hardly<br>
likely to be correct.  The observed precession is also at variance with that<br>
calculable using special relativity, as are other anomalies within the solar<br>
system (e.g.  abberances in the moon's motion).  Interested readers may also<br>
want to read E. Gerjuoy, "Feasibility of a non-relativistic Explanation for<br>
the Advance of the Perihelion of Mercury;" American Journal of Physics, 24:3<br>
[1956].  Recent microwave measurements of solar system distances were<br>
reported to be .5% different from previous measurements.  This indicates<br>
opportunities for further interesting discoveries.  There have been no<br>
successful measurements of any velocity of propagation for gravitational<br>
force.<br>

<i>&gt; In the same paper Einstein said that light from a star that just grazes </i><br>
<i>&gt; the surface of the sun should be deflected by 1.75 seconds of arc. It is.</i><br>

 {X2} Eddington and Cottingham's Hyades Starlight Deflection Observations<br>
      ===================================================================<br>
<p>
     Johann Georg von Soldner, in [1801], calculated the bending of light<br>
rays grazing the sun's disk.  (Also referred to in Stanley L. Jaki,<br>
"Foundation of Physics" 8, [1978]).  A hundred years later, Einstein repeated<br>
the prediction that starlight passing by the Sun would be deflected by the<br>
sun's gravity, so that the apparent distance between stars either side of the<br>
Sun when viewed during an eclipse would be smaller.<br>
<p>
     According to Will, a deflection of 0.875 seconds of arc for<br>
gravitational deflection only was calculated by von Soldner, using Classical<br>
Mechanics and a hypothetical light velocity of around 300,000 km. per second.<br>
Einstein's special relativity predicted .83 on Newtonian grounds (Einstein<br>
[1920]); his general relativity 1.75; in [1919], it is asserted that<br>
Eddington and Cottingham, in only one of sixteen photographs, measured 1.98 +<br>
or - 0.12; 1.61 + or - 0.15: and six months later on November 6 that year,<br>
Frank Dyson announced further results of 1.72 + or - 0.01 and 1.82 + or -<br>
0.15. Eddington staged a publicity coup, announcing this at the Liverpool<br>
Physical Society, causing Oliver Lodge to walk out.  Similar as well as<br>
different observations have been made since that time.  This evidence is now<br>
considered to be inconclusive with regard to Einstein's theory.<br>
<p>
     If a ballistic theory of light is accepted, so that light has mass and<br>
is therefore subject to gravity, then the Eddington eclipse observations of<br>
[1919], rather than requiring acceptance of Einstein's 'curved-space' theory,<br>
provided further data to calculate the properties of starlight from the<br>
Hyades, and the forces governing its travel, as well as the characteristics<br>
of the Sun.  The moon's gravity also deflects light, as was shown by Warren<br>
Marrison, January 24, [1925].<br>
<p>
     The sun's corona extends past Mercury's orbital path; the sun's<br>
chromosphere extends 10,000 km from the sun's surface.  A gas-lens effect<br>
therefore deflects starlight passing through it.  This is complicated by<br>
extreme acoustic effects imparted to the chromosphere by events on the sun's<br>
surface.  The "solar wind" of particles (mostly protons) extends outward<br>
indefinitely.  The sun's intense magnetic and electrical forces can cause<br>
deflection of light (the Zeeman and Stark effects).  There may also be a<br>
"diffractive" as well as a gravitational deflection.  And the cooling of<br>
Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse period must affect measurements by<br>
altering the atmosphere's refractive index.<br>
<p>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; General Relativity predict that time runs slower in a gravitational field, </i><br>
<i>&gt; such as on the surface of the Earth than it does in open space far from </i><br>
<i>&gt; any large mass. Because it's a scientific and not just a philosophical </i><br>
<i>&gt; theory it can give you numbers and tell you exactly how much slower, just </i><br>
<i>&gt; use the following formula:</i><br>

<i>&gt;             \/       c^2</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; 99.99999993%  as fast as a clock in deep space. This has been confirmed </i><br>
<i>&gt; experimentally and has become important commercially. Global Positioning </i><br>
<i>&gt; Satellites contain atomic clocks and send out timing signals, they enable </i><br>
<i>&gt; a receiving station to calculate his position within a few inches, if </i><br>
<i>&gt; General Relativity was not taken into account this would not be possible, </i><br>
<i>&gt; instead we have a multi billion dollar industry.</i><br>
<p>
      &lt;Sigh&gt;.  Here, you have to understand a most basic methodological <br>
      point.  If I assert that -- in a gravitational field -- the <br>
      frequency of a quartz clock slows, due to gravitational force <br>
      modifying the structure of the quartz molecules and the electron <br>
      orbits, that's not the same as saying 'time itself slows down.'  <br>
      That's your same old positivist dreck again.<br>
<p>
      The frequency reduction is an empirical question -- the explanation <br>
      for it is quite another matter.  <br>
<p>
      Relational Mechanics handles GPS just fine.<br>
<p>
    <br>
<i>&gt; The gravitational field on the second story of a house is a little </i><br>
<i>&gt; weaker than it is on the first story 10 feet below, General Relativity </i><br>
<i>&gt; predicts that time will run slower down there, 3 parts in 10^16 slower.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Incredibly even this tiny difference has been detected experimentally, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and it was done more than 30 years ago, using the Mossbauer effect for </i><br>
<i>&gt; which he received the Nobel prize.</i><br>
 <br>
      Same positivist argument again.  You say 'time slows':  I say the <br>
      clock slows. In Relational Mechanics, _all the metrics_ (Mass, <br>
      Length and Time) are _invariant_.  It's a great theoretical <br>
      strength, invariance.  Einstein's positivism focused him on physical <br>
      constants ('c', Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt; Relational or Faradayan or Newtonian or Graviton-mediated </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt; gravitational force gets along just fine in a Euclidean </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt; framework.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, and they get along just fine with your philosophy, but they don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; agree with experiment, in such a confrontation the victor is clear. Your </i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy may insist that an instrument produce a certain reading but if </i><br>
<i>&gt; it stubbornly refuses to do so then its time to find a new philosophy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
       You don't get it.  I'm saying that there are no such disagreements <br>
       with experimental results.  One of the burdens I cheerfully <br>
       shoulder is knowing your theories much better than you do.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;What the hell are you talking about?  GR?</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Give that man a cigar.</i><br>
<p>
      Actually, I gave up smoking the day Yul Brynner died (he left a -- <br>
      televised -- film clip saying he was dying from smoking a hundred <br>
      ciggies a day, and asked his fans to stop smoking in remembrance of <br>
      him.  I stopped right there and then.  11 October, 1985).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, if as you say the universe is infinite in all directions and thus </i><br>
<i>&gt; is infinitely old and has an infinite number of stars, how do you explain </i><br>
<i>&gt; Olber's Paradox. Why is the sky dark at night? </i><br>
<p>
      Good question.  The key is the (average) ratio of stars to volume of <br>
      space in the Universe.  The 'cosmic soup' scatters the starlight, <br>
      and gravitational accretion reconstitutes the photons back into <br>
      stars again.  It's a true 'steady-state' system.  Perpetuum Mobile <br>
      -- there's 'no way out of the system.'  <br>
<p>
      No 'entropic heat-death' in this, our Relational Mechanics Universe, <br>
      thank you!  Strike the Second Law of Thermodynamics...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;An infinite Universe has nowhere to expand _into_. Right?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Wrong.</i><br>
<p>
      Yeah?  Infinity into infinity = zero.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Incidentally, the universe does not expand into space, space itself is  </i><br>
<i>&gt; expanding.          </i><br>
<p>
      Now we confront the faintly ridiculous spectacle of a neo-positivist <br>
      arguing sternly that 'nothing' (i.e. empty space) can expand!  &gt;:-}<br>
