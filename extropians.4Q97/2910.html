<i>&gt; The problem is when people believe that harming or destroying others</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an appropriate and effective way of accomplishing what they want</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the world.</i><br>
<p>
Note the similarities to other dysfunctional but widespread social<br>
strategies (such as inventing excuses for coming late; nobody believes<br>
them, but we still invent them). There are plenty of bad strategies<br>
around, but since they are tenacious and self-reinforcing they are<br>
hard to get rid off. I have a feeling we need to develop cognitive<br>
psychology and memetics more in order to really do something about<br>
this general problem. Violence is more specific (and immediately<br>
dangerous), so it is worth focussing on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, the problem is that many people learn, mostly through observation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; others, that violence and threats of violence are somewhat effective ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; of getting others to do what they want them to.  This strategy works, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; some extent, so it is reinforced.  It also tends to cause the adrenal</i><br>
<i>&gt; glands to secrete adrenelin, which can be quite pleasant, so the behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt; is reinforced further.</i><br>
<p>
To make things worse, adrenalin also is a memory enhancer. And let's<br>
not forget the dominance-submission behaviors which we mammals are so<br>
fond of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, the violence strategy is flawed in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; major ways.  The most obvious flaw is that it places the attacker in</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant danger to their own life and well-being, which conflicts with</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own internal drive for safety.  It also tends to encourage others</i><br>
<i>&gt; to avoid them, thus conflicting with their drive for social acceptance. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The violence strategy also makes it difficult for the user to bond</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionally with others since they tend to use violence most frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt; against those they live with or are around most often.</i><br>
<p>
Note the self-reinforcing effect here too, since this isolation can be<br>
broken by more violence, or by associating with other violent<br>
individuals in a group situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe violence is a learned behavior and the idea that violence is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; good solution is a common and powerful meme.  What we need are some very</i><br>
<i>&gt; good counter-memes.  People need to realize that violence is not a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; long-term solution.  And they need to teach their children that, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; teach them much more effective ways of getting what they want, so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence will seem like a ridiculous alternative.</i><br>
<p>
A good idea. I think we should introduce children to the logic of the<br>
prisoners dilemma as early and possible, showing them *why and how*<br>
cooperation in general is better than defection (instead of the<br>
traditional way that just says cooperation is "good" and defection<br>
"evil"). I have no doubt that it is possible to raise kids into<br>
balanced, rational people, but it may be hard to do it in<br>
general. That is what we need memetics for.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since so many people are violent, how do the rest of us effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect ourselves from them?  I think that part of the basic training of</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans, along with communication skills, problem solving skills and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; such basic skills should include highly effective self-defence skills and</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies.  People should be trained to use their bodies effectively in</i><br>
<i>&gt; situations which require close, unarmed combat, and they should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; trained to effectively use weapons of all sorts, especially how to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary objects as weapons.  With everyone well-trained, violence would</i><br>
<i>&gt; no longer be a good solution, even in the short-term, since there would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be few potential victims, and the risk of trying violence would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; great, especially since any bystanders would be quite capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; apprehending you.</i><br>
<p>
In principle I agree with you. I train ninjutsu myself, and have found<br>
that the training has benefits on many levels ranging from fitness to<br>
an improved ability to deal with people and situations I wouldm<br>
formerly have found threatening. If people in general could get the<br>
same benefits, it would be great and likely reduce violence<br>
significantly. Unfortunately it is not easy to implement this, both<br>
practically and given the fact that a significant number of people<br>
tend to be too passive (not to mention effects such as diffusion of<br>
social responsibility).  But I think it is worth looking into.<br>
