<p>
We have the instincts we have because they were evolutionarily advantageous<br>
in the Stone Age.  Our culture classifies our instincts into the 'higher'--<br>
e.g. love for spouses and children, not hurting those who don't hurt you,<br>
fairness, appreciation of music, and the 'lower'-- e.g. mob violence, rape,<br>
theft.  The progress of civilization has been, in large part, the<br>
development of mechanisms for suppressing the 'lower' and enhancing the<br>
'higher'.  It is a natural assumption that posthumans will have progressed<br>
down this path even further than we have.<br>
<p>
I am not convinced of this.  Let me explain.<br>
<p>
Instincts originate from the evolution of replicating minds.  The process<br>
of replication that formed our minds occured mostly before the invention of<br>
agriculture.  The process of replication that will give rise to<br>
posthumanity has not yet started.  When it happens, many different<br>
architectures for the mind will contend.  They may contend peacefully, by<br>
convincing people that they should reconstruct themselves along certain<br>
lines, or by creating offspring according to a certain plan.  But they may<br>
also contend violently, by forcing reconstruction on others, or by siezing<br>
others' rescources and diverting them to the production of offspring.<br>
Which strategy or mix of strategies proves most effective determines what<br>
kind of posthumans we end up with.  I could well imagine all posthumans<br>
being saints, but I could also imagine them combining the powers of gods<br>
with the morals of bacteria.<br>
