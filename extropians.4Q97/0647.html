Dear Freespeak:<br>
Maybe we had better work on Freethink before we Freespeak.<br>
Actually, that's the main problem with trying to administer a government<br>
for the common good. <br>
It's simply that most people don't think in terms of the common good if<br>
they think at all. Everybody has at least one opinion that they flatulate<br>
on a regular basis. The problem is if they have an opinion that's the<br>
limit of their perception. In other words no one elses opinion matters or<br>
is even listened to. <br>
It never ceases to amaze me as to how ideologicaly fixated and parochial<br>
we've all become. <br>
You can fantasize about your perception of government until the cows come<br>
home but how are you going to impliment what you believe?<br>
Enough already,<br>

Subject: Is "Government" Possible?<br>

IS "GOVERNMENT" POSSIBLE?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From some recent posts I got the idea that it might</i><br>
be interesting -- possibly even useful! -- for people<br>
on the Advanced Freedom Solutions List to discuss the<br>
question: "Is "Government" Possible?"<br>
<p>
Note that I'm not asking whether "government" is<br>
necessary; I'm asking whether "it" is *possible*.<br>
<p>
To get the discussion going, I present two major<br>
propositions with minor corolaries: <br>
<p>
1. Individual human beings are volitional.  We have<br>
power of choice.  Through our brains, we essentially<br>
control the energy that animates our bodies.  I lift<br>
my finger as a result of a decision in my brain.  To<br>
learn more how and why this implies that we are free by<br>
nature, read 'The Discovery of Freedom' by Rose Wilder<br>
Lane -- available from &lt;<a href="http://www.laissezfaire.org/">http://www.laissezfaire.org/</a>&gt;.<br>
This issue is also covered in some of the basic freedom<br>
reports at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
1a. The notion that we can be "externally controlled"<br>
is a myth.  It's only because most people have been<br>
brainwashed into believing and obeying terrocrats<br>
(coercive political agents or terrorist bureaucrats)<br>
that the apparency of "external control" is created<br>
in some people's minds.<br>
<p>
2. From cybernetics (the science of control and feedback<br>
systems) we learn that in many cases a controlling<br>
process has to be around 1,000 - 10,000 times faster<br>
than a controlled process.  Consider, for example,<br>
a steel-making oven controlled by a computer.  The<br>
"significant time frame" of the oven is about five<br>
minutes.  If the oven starts overheating, corrective<br>
action typically has to be taken within five minutes<br>
to prevent permanent damage to the oven.<br>
<p>
In order for the computer to take corrective action<br>
within five minutes, it typically has to perform of<br>
the order of 100 actions or calculations per second.<br>
The "significant time frame" of the computer has to<br>
be around one-hundredth of a second.  In addition,<br>
the computer must be able to "sense" the temperature<br>
of the oven, detect changes that require intervention,<br>
and transmit signals to the oven's heating mechanism<br>
for corrective action.  (In this example, the<br>
controlling process is about of 30,000 times faster<br>
than the controlled process.)<br>
<p>
2a. Consider driving a car.  Your brain and senses<br>
constitute the controlling process.  The car is<br>
the controlled process.  If the car starts veering<br>
off the road, or some other eventuality requires<br>
corrective action, you typically need to do something<br>
within a second to prevent an "accident" or disaster.<br>
Therefore, the "significant time frame" of the car<br>
is around one second, maybe less.<br>
<p>
In order for your brain to be fast enough to signal<br>
your muscles to take the exact and precise corrective<br>
actions necessary, within a second, it probably has<br>
to perform actions and calculations at the rate of<br>
at least 1,000 per second.  It may have to perform<br>
parallel processing to achieve this.  A strong case<br>
can be made that the brain as controlling process<br>
requires a "significant time frame" 1,000 times or<br>
more faster than that of the car being controlled.<br>
<p>
2b. There are certain "dumb" control processes such<br>
as the governer of a steam engine.  The governor<br>
consists of "flaps" that rotate above openings from<br>
which steam can escape.  As the engine speeds up,<br>
centrifugal force raises the flaps, enlarging the<br>
openings, enabling more steam to escape, slowing<br>
down the engine.  The governer establishes and<br>
maintains the maximum speed of the steam engine.<br>
<p>
Another example of a dumb control process is the<br>
thermostat that turns the air-conditioning system<br>
on an off.<br>
<p>
2c. Considering these cybernetic factors, you could<br>
conclude that, in order for "government control" to<br>
be possible:<br>
(i) The terrocrats who masquerade as "government"<br>
would have to have extremely fast brains;<br>
(ii) The "controlled" victims would have to provide<br>
the terrocrats with all the information necessary for<br>
"external control" (or the terrocrats would have to<br>
be omniscient);<br>
(iii) The "controlled" victims would have to have<br>
extremely slow brains;<br>
(iv) The "controlled" victims would have to be<br>
brainwashed into belief and obedience, that is,<br>
further "dumbed down";<br>
(v) The "controlled" victims would have to be<br>
subject to control by dumb control processes.<br>
