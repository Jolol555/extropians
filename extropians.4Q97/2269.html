I seem to remember a Scottish study (sorry, no references ;( ) that found<br>
a steady decline in sperm count for Scottish men in the last couple<br>
decades.  The suggestion was that this phenomenon was caused by<br>
environmental estrogens.  Estrogen analogues can be found in everything<br>
from common shampoo to pesticides, and it is interesting to note that<br>
sperm counts are lower in rural agricultural areas, which *may* be the<br>
result of estrogen analogues in pesticides.<br>

True, this is an apparent contradiction, and it reminds me of something I<br>
was reading recently.  I was reading about some environmentalist movement<br>
that had its roots in Germany.  They underlying doctrine of this group<br>
was: if we kill ourselves, we'll be helping the environment.  Apparently,<br>
some techno song supporting this meme (and created by a member) is on the<br>
top 20 list in Germany.  Can someone verify this? (especially those in<br>
Germany)  It seems to me if these people exist, they pose the greatest<br>
threat to human beings imaginable.  It seems only logical that the next<br>
step in their logic would be "why don't we kill everyone else."  The<br>
danger would be that these characters would take Kamakazi(excuse my<br>
spelling) to a whole new level-- their objective would be to kill as many<br>
people as possible including themselves.  I hope I don't sound<br>
too paranoid, but if this group exists, they sound very dangerous.<br>
