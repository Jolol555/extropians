To give you an idea of just how bad it is, the CEO of France Telecom ( a<br>
US$30 billion company ) makes something like US$70,000 a year.  Any one<br>
with any intelligence hates working in France.  I recently recruited one of<br>
the top officers of France Telecom from his US$40,000 per year job in<br>
France to come work for my fledgling company.  A very bright guy (educated<br>
at UC Berkeley), he wanted to move to Silicon Valley so he could make some<br>
real money and get involved in the entrepreneurial scene.  By law, it is<br>
extremely difficult to do business as a startup in France.  Taxation and<br>
regulation make it extremely expensive to get involved in businesses that<br>
involve just about anything relating to the Internet and computers.<br>
<p>
Another regulation I heard from the French at France Telecom:  A company<br>
*must* give 60 days notice prior to firing any employee.  Would you really<br>
want to keep a disgruntled and presumably useless employee around 60 days<br>
after telling him he's going to be canned?  No wonder they have gun control<br>
laws...<br>
