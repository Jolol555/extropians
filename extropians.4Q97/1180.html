<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Where can I find some good information about this (effing etc.)? At</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the moment, this doesn't seem quite realistic to me, but I'm willing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to learn :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	That's the problem.  This kind of stuff seems so basic to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy of mind that it is utterly surprising to me that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't more scholarly stuff written about this kind of stuff. </i><br>
<p>
At this very moment, I don't think there is that much need to solve this <br>
problem. The technology to copy yourself is out of reach, isn't it? <br>
Before that, we're facing another problem: what about simulated <br>
consciousness. We kill most animals without really caring, but what about <br>
killing a simulation of a human identity - simply switching the power off <br>
and deleting the information?<br>
<p>
We are all humans and believe that we all have consciousness, currently, <br>
I don't see any way to prove this. I know that I am real, and that I have <br>
a consciousness, but the whole world around may be just simulated <br>
(maybe we've had nanotech milleniums ago, and my current 'experience' is <br>
just an attempt to understand ancient biological organisms). It's <br>
pointless to discuss this, but I think it illustrates the problem very well.<br>
<p>
Even when you completely understand the brain, it's just like completely <br>
understanding a computer. Does Eliza have a consciousness or not? If I <br>
scan my brain, and have a simulation of my personality in a computer <br>
(which will probably be easier than copying myself), does this simulation <br>
have a right to 'live'? Even if I can't experience what this simulation <br>
experiences, I'd still try to protect it because it could completely <br>
replace me (maybe the computer is simply better), and then could be the <br>
one who decides about what is done with me (the simulation also can't <br>
prove that I have a consciousness).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	It could be likely that if you are Dup1 you will be extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.</i><br>
<p>
That's something you could control: before duplicating yourself, <br>
understand that after duplication, you can either be the real one, or the <br>
duplicate - then, look at the place where you get scanned, and the place <br>
where the copy is 'created'. After duplication, you have an easy way to <br>
decide whether you're the original or the copy - but you will also know <br>
that to the outside world, it doesn't make ANY difference. Of course, you <br>
will remain in your body. You could consider your duplicate some sort of <br>
'child' - only that from the first moment, it has your 'functionality'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even</i><br>
<i>&gt; though Trans2 claims he is the same.  If you were Trans2 you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1</i><br>
<i>&gt; was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trans.</i><br>
<p>
That's the major problem: the world will never find out that you were <br>
actually blown out of existance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original Dup and Dup1 would possibly equally annoy you by claiming he</i><br>
<i>&gt; was the real Dup.</i><br>
<p>
YOU won't be dup2, but you can be sure that dup2 feels exactly the way <br>
you do (at least for the first few moments).<br>
<p>
That's quite an interesting thing: _I_ would probably go mad after <br>
transportation, because my new instance couldn't deal with the fact that <br>
I was wiped out. Someone who believes that it works (that the <br>
consciousness is transported with the information), would feel fine (and <br>
the original wouldn't care because it simply does not exist anymore).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; your state or shape.  If you organized the proper stuff(*1) into this</i><br>
<i>&gt; proper shape it would be you.</i><br>
<p>
The way uploading is described in the Extropian-FAQ seems possible, but <br>
if that works, 'transporters' like in Star Trek will be completely <br>
obsolete (you simply download a part of you to any place, then scan that <br>
'instance' of you after it made some experiences, and by that expand your <br>
consciousness - you won't be able to experience what your new instance <br>
experiences first hand, unless you're connected in any way - but that <br>
doesn't really matter... only if that instance gets destroyed before you <br>
can access the new information)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; though you may have to be like God to be able to do this or at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; to come up with the complete information required to duplicate someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; that was say cremated 1000 years ago.)  This state of you is self</i><br>
<i>&gt; existent.  This fact about you can't be created by any God nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed by even the universe ceasing to exist.  It is a logically</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary fact that you can exist.  Your existence proves this</i><br>
<i>&gt; absoluely.</i><br>
<p>
This is the concept of 'soul' right? I do exist, but only because my <br>
brain and body exist (the brain seems more important, but it will <br>
probably be possible to simulate the body, so my 'consciousness' won't <br>
even realize it).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	It is conceivable, however, that this barrier can be crossed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just as evolution has added all of our modes of sensing so that our</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind is directly aware of them so that we can compare and contrast</i><br>
<i>&gt; them we will surely some day be able to enhance our brain and add</i><br>
<i>&gt; additional cortexes that experience other sensations.  Once we</i><br>
<i>&gt; discover what qualia are, we should be able to construct scanning</i><br>
<i>&gt; devices that watch particular areas of the brain and determining when,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, a particular salty sensation is occuring.  This information could</i><br>
<i>&gt; then be transmitted to a brain augmented with a generic qualia</i><br>
<i>&gt; producing device whereupon it produces the identical qualia in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness of other brain.  I call this "effing".  One my say:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "That isn't what salt tastes like to me!"</i><br>
<p>
I think this is the most relevant part. I think I do understand what you <br>
mean by effing now, but I don't think it will help finding out where <br>
'consciousness' is. This will be quite interesting, for example you'll be <br>
able to experience things exactly like other people, maybe even computers <br>
- but it's still YOU who makes this experience, and it won't help you <br>
prove another consciousness. It will also not help transferring your <br>
consciousness. Mind merging could be possible, though.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	It's hard for us to imagine this since the conscious space in</i><br>
<i>&gt; our brain is currently primitively very fixed, non expandable, and has</i><br>
<i>&gt; only one point of view.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think so. By certain substances, you can alter the chemistry in <br>
your brain, which also changes your consciousness temporarily. If you <br>
know how extreme some of these substances are, this gives you a vague <br>
idea what 'uploading' means, I guess (it's even more different... a LOT <br>
more different).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So to make it more intuitive, think of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing part of your consciousness being dup1 and the hearing part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your consciousness being dup2.  Together you can both hear what is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going on in the "to" or copy location and see what is going on in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "from" or original location but you are, together, one conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; being.  If the dup1 is to be destroyed, it would be like being</i><br>
<i>&gt; temporarily blinded, but you wouldn't be dead.  You would of course be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to reproduce the seeing part of your consciousness within dup2</i><br>
<i>&gt; restoring your sight.  Though part of you temporarily died, because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; effing of consciousness all of you would not have died.  This would</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly solve your intuitive objection to the idea through conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuity.  Of course destruction of any part of you is always a</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem and avoidance of such is always desirable if possible.  But,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you are consciously spread across multiple platforms, are able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfer data and memories between them, you will always know that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can regenerate the particular part that was destroyed in some other</i><br>
<i>&gt; location or time if necessary or possible.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think this really helps (at least it doesn't make it clear to me)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (*1) If you insist on something mysterious or ghost like being</i><br>
<i>&gt; included in this "stuff" that you are made of the argument still</i><br>
<i>&gt; applies although at a slightly different level(*2).  If one of you</i><br>
<p>
I wish one could finally prove 'soul' - that would make it SO much <br>
easier! If 'soul' was a not yet discovered energy, you could look <br>
for ways to redirect that energy. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be <br>
'real'...<br>
<p>
sorry for the long posting, I hope it showed some new aspects...<br>
