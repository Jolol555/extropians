Dear John,                                        22 November 1997<br>
<p>
      Thank you for your -- amusing! -- response.<br>
<p>
      Next time, just make sure that your mind is engaged before putting <br>
      your keyboard into gear.  OK?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      As Popper says, the 'wrong' approach to science betrays itself in <br>
      its craving to be 'right.'  You can have certainty, or you can have <br>
      depth, but you cannot have both.  My state of mind has little or <br>
      nothing to do with physics, except to a reductionist monist.  A <br>
      moment's thought should show this, but thinking is _so_ hard, isn't <br>
      it?  And a moment is _such_ a long time...  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, you -- and Carl -- are unreasoningly pissed off by my <br>
      pointing out the origins of Quantum ElectroDynamics in Walter Ritz's <br>
      [1908] work.  Yet others before me have pointed this fact out, and <br>
      Feynman and Wheeler's interested in Ritz's work is well-known among <br>
      historians of science.<br>
<p>
      As Paul Forman (Smithsonian) writes, Ritz's work deserves critical <br>
      extension.  I'm glad that Richard Feynman did just that; and sorry <br>
      he didn't acknowledge Ritz's priority.  We all want to be original, <br>
      of course, but the nature of the creation of World Three, the world <br>
      of Objective knowledge, makes that kinda difficult...<br>
<p>
<p>
      [ FX: "One man deserves the credit. One man deserves the blame.  And <br>
      _Nikolai Ivanovitch Lobachevski_ is his name..." -- Tom Lehrer ]<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After Tony Hollick, our resident crackpot, showed he was ignorant enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; to publicly malign Richard Feynman, one of the greatest men of the 20'th </i><br>
<i>&gt; century, and offensive enough to do it in front of his son, I resolved to </i><br>
<i>&gt; take Carl's advice about people who refuse to learn and just ignore his </i><br>
<i>&gt; babbling, but Hollick's last post was so stupid my resolve weakened.</i><br>
                   <br>
      There you go...  I also think Richard Feynman is one of the greatest <br>
      men of the Twentieth Century.  He's a great writer, especially.  <br>
      Matter/forces/empty space metaphysics is hardly new...  The Ancient <br>
      Greeks gave us the basic idea thousands of years ago...<br>
<p>
<p>
      Still and all, good criticism is hard to find, and is often more <br>
      valuable than praise or friendship.  I just wish yours was better...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture'      </i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;approach to physics (i.e. my preference);and the instrumentalist      </i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;reified' mathematical approach.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the comic book approach to </i><br>
<i>&gt; physics (i.e. your preference); and the intelligent mathematical approach</i><br>
<i>&gt; (i.e. Feynman's preference).</i><br>
              <br>
      Popper describes your view as vicious; now you're proving him right.<br>
<p>
      <br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Electrons held in orbit by a balance of electric force against         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;inertia </i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt; That's idiotic. The electron has very little inertia, the smallest mass </i><br>
<i>&gt; of any non zero particle. Because the proton in an atom is so  near, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; electron feels a huge force tugging it into the nucleus. Even the tiny &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; force exerted by a feather could move an iceberg the size of a mountain</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you give it enough time, yet we know that matter has been stable for </i><br>
<i>&gt; billions of years. Not that you'd need billions of years, the electron's </i><br>
<i>&gt; mass is so small and the force of attraction toward the proton is so </i><br>
<i>&gt; strong that if classical physics were correct the electron would crash </i><br>
<i>&gt; into the nucleus in much less than a nanosecond.</i><br>
<p>
      "Inertial mass: n. the mass of a body as determined by its momentum, <br>
      as opposed to gravitational mass.  The acceleration of a falling <br>
      body is inversely proportional to its gravitational mass: as all <br>
      falling bodies have the same constant acceleration the two types of <br>
      mass must be equal."<br>
<p>
      <br>
      So follow the logic: at a sufficient orbital velocity, the inertial <br>
      mass _must_ balance the electric force attraction of the electron to <br>
      the nucleus.  The logic is _unbreakable_.  You're 'Arsgefichte'...<br>
      <br>
      The electron orbits are 'locked' into quantized fixed series <br>
      ('shells') by the necessity for the wiggly electron paths to form <br>
      exact integer frequencies (so the ends of the orbital paths 'join <br>
      up', right?).  This is all in Petr Beckmann's 'Einstein Plus Two' <br>
      [1997].  R.A. Waldron deals with Beckmann and Mandics, BTW.  They <br>
      were friends (and rivals).<br>
      <br>
      Petr Beckmann received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering <br>
      from the University of Prague.  He received his Dr. Sc. degree from <br>
      the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1962.  He defected to the <br>
      US in 1963, and taught at the University of Colorado until his <br>
      retirement in 19681.  ISTR he was Professor Emeritus there.  I've <br>
      chatted with him on a number of occasions.  He gave me my copy of <br>
      'Einstein Plus Two.'  I think he's competent.<br>
      <br>
      He has published more than sixty scientific papers, mostly devoted <br>
      to electromagnetics and probability theory.  His best-selling books <br>
      include 'A History of Pi' [1981];  and 'The Health Hazards of NOT <br>
      Going Nuclear.' [1985]  He edited and published 'Access To Energy', <br>
      the pro-science, pro-technology, pro-free enterprise monthly <br>
      newsletter, now in its 25th year, with 15 000 subscribers.<br>
<p>
       <br>
<i>&gt; And that's far from your only problem. All the protons in the nucleus </i><br>
<i>&gt; have the same charge and are even closer together, the repellent force </i><br>
<i>&gt; they experience is truly astronomical, yet the nucleus does not fly</i><br>
<i>&gt; apart and the thing that stops it sure as hell isn't inertia, it's the</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong nuclear force.</i><br>
<p>
      &lt;Sigh&gt;.  I explicity point out that the extension of Relational <br>
      Mechanics to the nucleus is the task of the Third Revision, <br>
      whereupon it will become Relational Dynamics.  Quantum <br>
      Chromodynamics is a hopeless mess, so demolishing it and <br>
      reconstructing particle physics along classical lines (the original <br>
      project of Bohr and Einstein, by the way) will be great fun.  You <br>
      seriously expect me to do all this _on my own_ on the back of an <br>
      envelope, when my 'competition' has thousands of people, and <br>
      billions of Statist dollars and vast Statist laboratories staffed by <br>
      conformists with obsolete State-certified 'credential' (all of which <br>
      we will take over in due course, natch!  &gt;:-} ).<br>

<i>&gt;          &gt;are in a condition which is analogous to 'free fall.' They're not     </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;accelerating in a way which causes emission of photons.      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If something is falling it is by definition accelerating and if charges </i><br>
<i>&gt; moving in a circle are not accelerating in " a way which causes emission </i><br>
<i>&gt; of photons" then when electrons move in a large circle in one of our high </i><br>
<i>&gt; energy laboratories they shouldn't radiate photons but they do, and the </i><br>
<i>&gt; effect is not subtle, the radiation is massive. The classical laws that </i><br>
<i>&gt; work so well when the electrons move in a circle many meters in diameter </i><br>
<i>&gt; are useless when you talk about the atom.</i><br>
                 <br>
      You're being tedious.  Bohr's hydrogen atom is essentially <br>
      'classical.'  I explain why the electron doesn't (ordinarily) <br>
      radiate in orbit.  No angular acceleration.  If it constantly <br>
      radiated, it would be violating the conservation laws. It can't.<br>
      <br>
      Then you shiftily start to give us this stuff about ring <br>
      accelerators.  Since I actually worked at Bristol University with a <br>
      CERN project (hunting muons) which involved visiting NIMROD at <br>
      Harwell (England) when it was under construction, and since a friend <br>
      of mine is Director, the Neutron Spallation facility at the <br>
      Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and designs the darned things, I <br>
      should know a little bit about all this.  And I can even read.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Does anyonwe here think that geometry is _empirically decideable_?</i><br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt; Is this a debatable point, does anyone here really think that the geometry of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe in which we live is not empirically  decideable_?</i><br>
<p>
      You're on dangerous ground now.  As Lakatos points out, Classical <br>
      Mechanics can be derived _inductively_.  Since Classical Mechanics <br>
      is based on Euclid's geometry, with the addition of mass-points and <br>
      vector forces, you've just played Russian Ruolette with all six <br>
      chambers loaded.  And you lost...   &gt;:-}<br>

<i>&gt;     &gt;There's no point in quoting Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;(non-existent) aether to  transmit forces</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's see, Maxwell was wrong</i><br>
<p>
      You want to 'bring back the aether'?  C'mon, show us all - I dare you!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Huygens misled</i><br>
<p>
      That's what Richard Feynman says.  Explicitly.  'Light is Particles'<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt; Einstein was an idiot</i><br>
<p>
      Well, we're _all_ ignorant, compared to how much there is to know...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bohr was a little slow</i><br>
<p>
      No!  He gave up _too easily_ on his original project of extending <br>
      Classical Mechanics into the microworld, is all.  We can all make <br>
      mistakes...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hawking is ignorant</i><br>
<p>
      True, I don't think much of Hawking's ideas.  Look what his mind did <br>
      to his poor body...  Would you want that to happen to you?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Copernicus was a plagiarist</i><br>
<p>
      We can't really say that until we prove that he _knew of_ Nicholas <br>
      of Cusa's work.  It's an interesting question, though...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as was Feynman</i><br>
<p>
      We _can_ prove that Feynman knew of Walter Ritz's work.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the second law of thermodynamics is an evil plot</i><br>
<p>
      Whoever mentioned Goethe and Schiller?  [ FX: "FLASH!!!" ] &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; relativity is foolishness</i><br>
<p>
      _Galilean_ Relativity is _perfectly sound_.  That's what I'm saying!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and quantum mechanics a con game.</i><br>
<p>
      "A shaky game" is the usual epithet in the 'trade', I believe...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sounds like you'd be happy with physics as it was around 1840, unless </i><br>
<i>&gt; that's not going far enough and you think that punk Newton shouldn't have </i><br>
<i>&gt; tried to improve on Aristotle.</i><br>
<p>
      Wrong.  I'm quite happy with 'physics' as it is now (i.e. including <br>
      Relational Mechanics), with the exception of the problems of <br>
      particle physics.  Abraham Pais' book "Inward Bound" is a <br>
      clearly-delineated descent into madness.  I don't have to follow <br>
      him, do I?.  Neither do you.  Neither does anyone else.<br>
<p>
      I 'walk back the cat', as the counterspies say.  I evaluate past <br>
      problem-situations and data in the light of present knowledge.  <br>
      20/20 hindsight!  Easy-peasy!<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your theory is that all the great physicists in at least the last 150 </i><br>
<i>&gt; years didn't know what they were talking about, but there is an alternate </i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, Tony Hollick doesn't know what he's talking about.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
      Following Alfred Tarski's Correspondence Theory of Truth utilizing a <br>
      metalanguage (and it doesn't get any better than this):<br>
      <br>
      "The statement 'Tony Hollick ne sait pas quest'ce que'il parle' is <br>
      true if -- AND ONLY IF -- Tony Hollick doesn't know what he's <br>
      talking about."  <br>
      <br>
      You're now demolished on two counts:<br>
      <br>
      [A] I plainly do know that of which I speak: and<br>
      <br>
      [B] What I say corresponds with the facts.<br>
