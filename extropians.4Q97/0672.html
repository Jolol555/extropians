And John Clarke commented:<br>
<p>

<p>
Here is how I look at this problem:<br>
<p>
Facts are not interesting in themselves. They are interesting *for* <br>
somebody in a certain situation. There is a considerable correlation, <br>
within some groups of humans,  between what sets of facts each finds <br>
interesting -- that's part of the reason why peer reviewed journals <br>
work: what the referees find interesting is more likely to interest <br>
the readership than what the referees don't find interesting. I also <br>
think that John is right about intelligent people tending to be <br>
interested in more things than stupid people. This, however, I take <br>
to be a fact about human psychology, not a neccessary truth about the <br>
essense of what intelligence is; as demonstrated by the existence of <br>
highly intelligent people who don't find anything interesting, for <br>
example because they are depressed.<br>
<p>
My guess is that what produces the feeling of intrigue and interest <br>
is activity in some fairly localised center of the brain, perhaps <br>
somewhere in the limbic system. It is known that electrical <br>
stimulation of these areas can produce intense sensations of hunger, <br>
thirst, irreality, remoteness, smallness (everything appears small), <br>
and it doeasn't seem implausible that intellectual interest might <br>
also originate here. What typically triggers this feeling can of <br>
course be some very high-level neocortical processing -- say, a <br>
physicist being excited by a formula because he understands its <br>
significance. But the same feeling could, in principle at least, also <br>
be triggered by means of appropriate electrical stimulation of the <br>
brain or by manipulating the emotive circuitry of the simulated <br>
intellect. In fact, the only reason that certain things naturally <br>
trigger our interest is that evolution has found the link conducive <br>
to fitness on the African savanna.<br>
<p>
I therefore see no reason why the present discrimination function by <br>
which humans discriminate between interesting ideas or <br>
facts and uninteresting ones could not be replaced by any other <br>
criterion one might come up with, including the one that *every* idea <br>
is highly interesting.<br>
<p>
Nor do I see any grounds for supposing that the present <br>
discrimination function is optimal for life in the modern world, less <br>
for the sort of life a superintelligence would live. "Optimal" should <br>
here be understood in the relative sense, as being conducive to <br>
achieving whatever other goals might be held by the individual. <br>
Instead I would expect that beings in the future, if they have the <br>
technology to do so, will adjust their curiosity to whatever level <br>
made them most efficient in achieving their other goals. If pleasure <br>
is one of these goals, then rather than making themselves inefficient <br>
by being too curios, they could leave their curiosity at the optimal <br>
level and turn on the pleasure directly, without going through the <br>
trouble of first encephalising it and associate it with a thought or <br>
an idea.<br>
<p>
These considerations suggest to me that while more intellectual <br>
curiosity, and its objective correlates (such as diversity, <br>
information, novelty etc.) might be very excellent things for people <br>
like us in a world like the one we are living in today, it might <br>
nevertheless  be overly anthropocentric to assume that these things <br>
will also play a central role for a superintelligence or a society of <br>
uploaded humans.<br>
