<i>&gt; In the United States there is a docterine known as a "Clear and Present</i><br>
<i>&gt; Danger."  If there is a "Clear and Present Danger" all rights under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution are null and void...</i><br>
<p>
There is no such general legal doctrine recognized by any court in the US.<br>
The words themselves come from a Supreme Court case having to do with the<br>
first amendment, where it was ruled that a clear and present danger of<br>
violence could justify restricting speech (the "fighting words" exception).<br>
The Supreme Court has ruled many times (for example, in U.S. v Nixon on<br>
the matter of his ignoring the subpoena of his tapes) that the executive<br>
branch cannot arbitrarily use "National Security" at its own discretion to<br>
violate Constitutional rights.<br>
<p>
Of course, that's the "official" position of the court.  The reality of<br>
course is that they have a bigger army than you do.  And law, after all,<br>
is a matter of what gets enforced by the ones with guns, not what happens<br>
to be written somewhere.<br>
