&lt;&lt;	A wormhole, as I understand it, is effectivly an area where space time has<br>
been curved by a strong enough source of gravity, to the extent that two<br>
points in space time are briged by a gap, thus allowing fast travel between<br>
two otherwise distant points.  The "gap" which connects the two points is<br>
an area which for all intents and purposes, doesnt really exist.  It is<br>
dimensionless with respect to time and space.<br>
	  That is the part I dont really understand too much. In effect, if you<br>
were able to walk into a wormhole, you would be entering this<br>
"non-existant" gap and you wouldnt find yourself traveling down a long<br>
tunnel with flashing lights and what not, you would enter and find yourself<br>
at the other end at the same time.  Does this then mean that if you are<br>
standing in a wormhole that you are in effect in two different places at<br>
the same time, and isnt that a paradox?<br>
	The area of non-existance which the bending of space-time creates would be<br>
the same as what is outside the boundary of the universe.  Obviously,<br>
outside the universe nothing exists because it hasnt occured, or been<br>
created yet; time has not occured there.  Then, if you could somehow reach<br>
the edge of the universe, or the edge of time (which too is a paradox) and<br>
you crossed the border between our universe (existance) and the other side<br>
(non-existance), like a wormhole, you could then travel from one side of<br>
the universe to the other instantaneously, assuming the universe is like a<br>
sphere of space time.<br>
	This is my understanding of this so far...please feel free to offer any<br>
guidance or other theories as to this.<br>
<p>

<p>
   Don't forget your option to regard wormhole theories as a bunch<br>
of crap. Sometimes we don't understand theories because our rational<br>
mind is begging us not to abandon it.<br>
