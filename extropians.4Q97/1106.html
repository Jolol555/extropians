Ok, wait a moment while I don my impressive mathematicians robe<br>
(complete with chalk dust)... :-)<br>
<p>
Infinities are tricky, but if you know the rules and are a bit careful<br>
you can handle them with no danger. Yes, there are differently "sized"<br>
infinities, some much "larger" than others. But in this case it is<br>
much simpler.<br>
<p>
In the star example, let's say there are around 1 star per cubic<br>
lightyear. That means that on a sphere of radius r there will be<br>
around 4 Pi r^2 stars. The intensity of a star at distance r is L/r^2<br>
where L is a constant (I assume all stars are equally bright now, for<br>
simplicitys sake). This means that the 4 pi r^2 stars on the sphere<br>
around us will shine with a total power of 4 Pi L - the two r^2 terms<br>
cancel each other. So the total luminosity from a spherical shell<br>
around us is independent of it's radius. This means that if we get one<br>
unit of light from all stars 1 lightyear away, we will get one unit<br>
from the stars 2 lightyears away, one from all stars 3 lightyears<br>
away, and so on. As you sum up the contributions from all the shells<br>
the sum get's larger and larger. And if you assume an infinite<br>
universe you will have to sum up the contributions of ever more remote<br>
stars, and the total luminosity will become larger than any finite<br>
luminosity.<br>
<p>
If you want a real in depth treatment of infinities, I suggest reading<br>
up on basic calculus and perhaps set theory.<br>
