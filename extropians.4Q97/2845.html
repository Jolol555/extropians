<p>
Its not that Gates might benefit, but that I and other members of the<br>
gun owning public are penalized. As a non-resident of Washington State,<br>
who travels there frequently, I would be severely limited in my ability<br>
to a)carry for personal protection b)bring and use firearms in sporting<br>
events in that State c) bring and use firearms on hunting trips to that<br>
state. Given that this penalizes me, I could only have retaliated by<br>
refusing to use microsoft products.<br>
<p>
FOrtunately, and hopefully, there is a bill pending in congressional<br>
committee which will do for carry permits what the Interstate Motor<br>
Vehicle Compact did for drivers licenses. If it passes, my concealed<br>
weapons permit here in New Hampshire will be applicable in all other<br>
states. In such event, I could then thumb my nose at Bill Gates. I am<br>
surprised, with the large number of his employees that are Libertarians,<br>
that he didn't experience a walkout or something for his support of that<br>
gun registration legislation.<br>

I'm planning on getting a Ruger Vaquero with a Bisley grip this spring,<br>
along with a .44 mag rifle.<br>
