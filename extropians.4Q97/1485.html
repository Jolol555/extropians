<i>&gt; &gt; Re: pollution: Yes, and sort of, and no. Depends on what you mean by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pollution. Less airborne nitrox compounds, sure. But the carbon and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trace elements in the fuel have to go somewhere. And catalyst bed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contamination remains a serious problem. Further, as I mentioned before,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many "hydrogen economy" plans just move the pollution around, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; _increasing_ the sum. Examples: farmed-methanol, central-site</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; electrolysis with hydride storage, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't the central-site plan's polution impact depend on how you get the</i><br>
<i>&gt; electricity to power the electrolysis?  Wouldn't certain solar (or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear fission) options net a lower total sum of polution?  Or are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about the extra metals and chemicals that are needed to manufacture</i><br>
<i>&gt; photovoltaics and storage devices?  If so, is this a study or just a guess?</i><br>
<p>
Fission isn't exactly popular these days, at least in the US. Yes, I am counting<br>
infrastructure costs, including the cost of disposing of the nasties that<br>
refining solar cell raw materials produces. Cost out a solar panel, cost out<br>
tracking gear, figure out what that 1kW/M^2 turns out to in real life, then talk<br>
to people who have tried it. Solar keeps beckoning, and the stage-to-stage<br>
efficiencies keep killing you. For specialty applications, or if you're<br>
well-off, solar is useful, especially compared with 9-volt 2U6 transistor radio<br>
batteries. But the ROI is slim slim slim. Today.<br>
<p>
I made earlier comments in a post some time ago. It's hard to beat the energy<br>
stored by all those plants collecting all that light long ago, then squooshed<br>
and heated by the Earth since the Carboniferous. Neither a study nor a guess, I<br>
priced the components and talked to experienced people (including Don<br>
Lancaster). Maybe someday the costs will go down. As I said, I believe that's<br>
unlikely in the short (predictable) term. Now, if you count hydro as solar<br>
(something has to evaporate all that ocean water to make the precipitation that<br>
fills the reservoirs)... we're already using solar.<br>
<p>
Re: alternative energy: If you nose around www.tinaja.com, you might find some<br>
relevant stuff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am under the impression that hydrogen gas could be distributed on the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; kinds of pipelines in use for natural gas today.  I  also have read that</i><br>
<i>&gt; hydrogen has an energy density 3 times that of gasolene, by mass (not by</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal volume, of course).  Good enough that a strong liquid hydrogen tank</i><br>
<i>&gt; could give you gasolene-like range (even given internal combustion</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiency) while venting less than 10% of its hydrogen storage per day to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep the contents cool.</i><br>
<p>
Hydrogen is *cold* in liquid form. And have you ever heard of "hydrogen<br>
embrittlement"? Many things are possible. Their being possible doesn't make them<br>
cost-effective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now, hypothetical complex-organic fuel cell catalysts (verging on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enzymes in complexity) *might* solve these  problems. I devoutly wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for them. But evidence of their actual commercial-quantity appearance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; remains sketchy at the present time--even though I built a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bacteria-powered fuel cell twenty years ago. IMHO, bulk nano is the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; likely way to produce such--by which time _everything else changes too_.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the differences/advantages between engineered bacteria and "bulk</i><br>
<i>&gt; nano?"  Also, could you tell us more about the bacteria-powered fuel cell?</i><br>
<p>
Well, they do blur together, rather, and I spoke loosely. I think it's possible<br>
that something bacterial could be developed that might be able to crank out the<br>
needed catalyst(s) in tank-car lots. Bulk nano, as I use the term, means<br>
building dumb structures (say of not much more complexity than modern<br>
composites; stupider than a living tree) at a very high rate. The difference as<br>
I envision it is that bulk nano might be able to extrude entire fuel cell<br>
elements in one step. I envision slightly more advanced bulk-like nano as being<br>
able to provide mechanisms for recovering the stuff that usually contaminates<br>
fuel cell electrodes (Sulfur, for one).<br>
<p>
To a first approximation, "Bulk Nano"=="no information processing required".<br>
This still makes bulk nano potentially more versatile than bacteria.<br>
<p>
Re: bacterial battery: Nope, I purged that info out of my memory banks. I am<br>
pretty sure it's still floating around as a science fair project. I'll see what<br>
I can dig up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; AFAIK, all published fuel cell chemistries that use hydrocarbons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; function in exactly the way I describe, by reforming the fuel at point</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of use: the fuel cell. Methanol is expensive for reasons mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; previously. The issue isn't purely one of how efficent the _fuel cell_</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is; it's a _systems_ concern.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If we are going to have fossil-fuels at the point-of-use, then we might as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well use internal combustion</i><br>
<p>
Yup.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; you can fart and roll down your window and do more damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the new car you are driving.</i><br>
<p>
Heh. Care to guess what the amount of fuel vapor you (anyone, not picking on you<br>
specifically) release when you vent your tank to fill up corresponds to in<br>
"dirty" miles driven? It's remarkable.<br>
<p>
That said, I drive an '85 beater. I think we're in violent agreement here.<br>
