<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	I only raise one question which may offer us a thin chance of</i><br>

<i>&gt;	naturally closed and doomed to collapse, is it conceivable</i><br>
<i>&gt;	that by intelligent intervention, converting matter into</i><br>
<i>&gt;	radiation and causing energy to flow purposefully on a cosmic</i><br>
<i>&gt;	scale, we could break open a closed universe and change the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	topology of space-time so that only a part of it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;	collapse and another part of it would expand forever?  I do</i><br>
<i>&gt;	not know the answer to this question. If it turns out that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	universe is closed, we shall still have about 10^10 years to</i><br>
<i>&gt;	explore the possibility of a technological fix that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;	burst it open.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the basic problem is the topology change; general relativity</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't allow the drastic change in topology from S^3 x [0:1] to</i><br>
<i>&gt;R^4. However, all is not lost since there are plenty of people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;study how topology change could occur in quantum gravity. It it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;occur, at least we might be able to make basement universes that are</i><br>
<i>&gt;open or closed depending on our cosmological preferences.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure either.  Of course, as Dyson noted, we have time -- and as<br>
I am inclined to believe, the universe may very well be open anyway.<br>
<p>
There might be other things involved to.  Perhaps, on a global scale,<br>
we are not limited to topological changes...  For instance, perhaps<br>
(and someone else has raised this possibility; so I make no claims to<br>
originality here:) we can "tear" off a region in such a way as to<br>
achieve just what Dyson was after.<br>
<p>
Another intriguing possibility in an open universe is that entropy and<br>
order can both increase -- in absolute NOT relative amounts.:)  This<br>
is Layzer's idea.  He might be wrong, but we should see if there's<br>
anything to his idea.<br>
