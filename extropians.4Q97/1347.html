FREEZE YOUR HEAD AND LIVE TO PARTY AGAIN!!!<br>
Cryonics is the technology for freezing a person after a terminal illness or<br>
a fatal accident, in the hope that medical science can revive that person in<br>
the future.<br>
<p>
In honor of the Alcor Foundation, who have been pioneers in cryonics<br>
research and technical development for more than twenty years, and are<br>
currently the largest provider of cryonics services in the world, and<br>
especially in thankful memory of the late Dr. Timothy Leary's effort to<br>
publicize their cause, we are gleefully throwing open the doors of the<br>
Exclave to all cryonicists, transhumans, extropians, and merely curious<br>
partygoers,<br>
for a gala CryoFeast, Saturday, December 6, 1997, beginning at 2 o'clock in<br>
the afternoon.<br>
<p>
We'll provide plates, cups, tableware, and wacky party decorations. To<br>
entertain you all, your hostess will single-handedly roast a super-size<br>
turkey (successfully defrosted and made into delicious food!) and a huge<br>
batch of roast potatoes with garlic. Please bring a favorite dish or<br>
beverages to share with others.<br>
<p>

located at 819 Pierino Ave, in Sunnyvale, California.<br>
