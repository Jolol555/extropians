<i>&gt; is small and far from the light source. The wave front of the blackbody</i><br>

<i>&gt; focus for the same reason a lage magnifying glass placed right next to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; light bulb will not focus. To work you'd have to place your telescope at a</i><br>
<i>&gt; large distance from the radiator where the wave front has become almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; parallel, and then only a very small percentage of the heat radiation would</i><br>
<i>&gt; intersect with the lens.</i><br>
<p>
At the focus of the telescope, with a really low f-ratio, the sky will<br>
be seen to be mostly the black hole. Imagine a an ellipsoid, with the<br>
radiaitor at one focus and the black hole at the other. The radiator<br>
will see the full sky as the black hole. All of the radiation from the<br>
radiator will go to the black hole. If you limit the reflector to the<br>
anterior half, you still have half the sky being the seen as the black<br>
hole, exactly as if you were near the event horizon. It still works if<br>
the radiator is a sphere which is smaller than the closest distance from<br>
the radiator to the mirror. (I agree that if the radiator is as large as<br>
the black hole that not all of the light will be absorbed, but someone<br>
with an optics program can resolve this. It's still a large fraction)<br>
<p>
Regarding your light bulb example, imagine the reflector to be a big<br>
umbrella. We don't need to focus to a point, just to the diameter of the<br>
event horizon as seen from a large distance.<br>
