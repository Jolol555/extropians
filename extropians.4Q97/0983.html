<p>
Hello All,<br>
<p>
My idea is to combine a few thoughts I had about a starting point<br>
and a history of the Transhuman movement.<br>
<p>
I would like to have one source of information were people can start<br>
reading about all (a lot :-) of the aspects of Extropy an &gt;H.<br>
Building up from History towards the future................<br>
<p>
Therefor I post this start text, which is of cause not much, but<br>
well.........<br>
it's a start. I suggest that all who like and know something of a specific<br>
subject send to my personal address their contribution. This way we<br>
will keep the traffic low on the list. <br>
<p>
I will compose from all your contributions a new text, and repost it <br>
again. This we will repeat a few times, until we will have a satisfying<br>
text/source/well...................<br>
<p>
What I would like to see develop is an optimistic and easy to read<br>
scientific correct story about.......well........basically about everything<br>
:-)<br>
But as I mentioned in the text, every line will have a number in front<br>
of it, so that anybody can refer to this text and his or her own <br>
opinion and additional information.<br>
<p>
So to make it a bit clearer. Someone who knows a lot about the DNA,<br>
will write and introduction to it (the basic concept) and in relation to<br>
the main text. For a detailed look into the matter, you can click on the <br>
number in front of the line, were you will find links, opinions, and<br>
references<br>
to books, etc........<br>
<p>
To kick it off, and get it on the road, I would like to suggest that:<br>
<p>
Anders, starts with the intro, the big bang, earth<br>
Max, starts with Civilization, and Now, and Future<br>
<p>
Doesn't have to be much, and you will probably have a lot of text<br>
you can easily copy. It's just the first structure !?<br>
<p>
Can I post it as .doc ??<br>
<p>
I will repost it with numbers per line on the 4th of November.<br>
So that we can start the discussion, and building process.<br>
And all the other people who would like to help can start adding<br>
their text.<br>
<p>
Also as suggestion:<br>
<p>
update 8 November<br>
update 12 November<br>
update 15 November<br>
update 19 November<br>
update 22 November<br>
final version for the year 1998 post on 29 November.<br>
<p>
USA and UK can relax, Sweden and the Netherlands can start the<br>
translation work :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I've read until now in the Extropy list, there are a lot of</i><br>
people with scientific knowledge, writing skills and enthusiast/<br>
optimistic/fun thoughts and opinions. I hope "we" can combine al<br>
this power in one very good "bible :-) of Transhumanism"<br>
<p>
Hope to hear from you all soon !!<br>
<p>
Greetings,  :-)<br>
<p>

Dynamic text, that is wide open for discussion. But to keep it as a =<br>
