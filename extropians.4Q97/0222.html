English doesn't handle different forms of concurrency well.  Pretty<br>
much we have "while", "during", and such.  What about ways of expressing<br>
doing multiple things at once in "task-sliced" vs. "time-sliced"<br>
concurrency modes?  And if there are multiple copies of you in constant<br>
communication, you'll probably want ways to refer to your various points<br>
of view and their intersection/union while at the same time preserving<br>
your sense of identity (whatever that is -- different discussion).<br>
<p>
What about expressing multivariable dynamically-changing probabilities?<br>
<p>
What about ways of expressing the passage of time for one of you that's<br>
still and another of you that's moving at .99c, when you're "talking to<br>
yourself"?<br>
<p>
Personally, I've always been at a loss for ways to adequately express<br>
joy and wonder, and I could hope that a new language would help with<br>
that, too....<br>
