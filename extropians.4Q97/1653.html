I have been interested in multi-agent complex systems lately, and though<br>
I still have to do a lot more reading and thinking, I would like to share a<br>
few ideas; maybe you'll help me figure things out. As always, I am<br>
looking for all kinds of remarks and references. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Multi-agent systems and action spaces<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
People distinguish various types of systems consisting of relatively<br>
autonomous functional parts. They call them: ecology, economy,<br>
society, organism, software, etc. The rules for identifying these systems<br>
are quite simple. For example, any system consisting of biological<br>
objects would be called an ecology, one made up of humans is a<br>
society, and a part of the latter that has to do with exchanging things is<br>
an economy. However, if one wants to understand the behavior of such<br>
systems (otherwise, why study them?) it seems more productive to<br>
subdivide them into functional types. This also allows to draw analogies<br>
between similar systems of different nature (e.g., a communist economy<br>
may be similar to an integrated organism, as its parts work directly on<br>
the central order, and the role of financial flows are reduced to assist<br>
the economic balancing mechanism. A contract economy looks much<br>
like a forest ecology, except that agents get locked into relationships by<br>
contracts, not niches, and some other manifestations of subsystems'<br>
intelligence. So multi-agent systems can be classified by overall<br>
complexity, internal control methods, structure and viscosity (transport<br>
capacities) of the space, methods of connecting agents into stable<br>
working groups (mutual specialization, physical coupling, force,<br>
emotional affection, ownership, contracts), diversity and intelligence of<br>
agents, etc. <br>
<p>
A general theory may also help to predict where new systems may have<br>
features qualitatively different from everything previously observed. For<br>
instance, space within modern communication and computing<br>
environments is effectively non-metric (it takes approximately the same<br>
time and effort to phone anybody in a country, or address any memory<br>
unit within a computer). This means that most space-related laws of all<br>
previous functional spaces would not apply to "digital" systems: there is<br>
no concept of premium location here, or differential rent, no<br>
"reproductive isolation" or other influence of space-induced separation<br>
on agents' communication and diversity. Also digital systems often have<br>
lower replication costs of agents than execution costs, which makes<br>
them dramatically different from all systems more essentially embedded<br>
in their physical substrates. - For humans, it's much easier to translate<br>
an article or to fix an appliance than to transfer their skills to another<br>
human capable. For a computer it is just copying a program. <br>
<p>
Together, the above features create a foundation for system design that<br>
is dramatically different from all natural and human agglomerations, in<br>
terms of agent specialization, diversity, and deployment. I would<br>
envision the future intelligence as a collection of highly specialized tools,<br>
with high-bandwidth interconnections, with "personalities", or complex<br>
problem solvers ("achievers", "goal engines", "research tools",<br>
"development threads") consisting of limited contractual relations<br>
between multiple problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting<br>
entities, that can at the same time be employed in many other similar<br>
relations. So the entities may use the same "body parts" on a<br>
cooperative or time-sharing basis. <br>
<p>
Economy and beyond<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
Economies are an interesting class of systems. By using quantitative<br>
symbols to represent typical value relations between various resources,<br>
economy allows efficient distribution of signals in the system, and<br>
provides short-sighted selfish agents with incentives to adjust their<br>
consumption and production efforts in accordance with the collective<br>
requirements of all other agents in the system. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, while the economy provides its agents with accurate<br>
estimates of generic values, it has little to offer to each individual agent<br>
in their attempts to figure the value of a certain product to their<br>
particular needs, or offer any other personalized or situational advice.<br>
This kind of knowledge is usually obtained by the economic agents in<br>
about the same way they discovered average social values of common<br>
products and services in pre-economic times: personal experience with<br>
the environment and direct communication with others. There are no<br>
quantitative instruments available for automated processing for this<br>
purpose. <br>
<p>
This is understandable: comprehensive detailed data about each agent's<br>
behavior so far has not been available in a usable form, communication<br>
and computational instruments necessary for processing this data have<br>
not been adequate, transaction costs have been too high, etc. All these<br>
obstacles are now being removed in many systems. <br>
<p>
With these tools in place, there appears a foundation for "a second<br>
signalling mechanism" in an economic system: together with conventional<br>
aggregate indicators of average costs of resources and services and<br>
their expectations, the new crop of signalling instruments may deliver<br>
suggestions of expected value that particular agents may derive in their<br>
individual situations from such resources or services. Then agents can<br>
be better equipped to optimize their behavior by using all available<br>
knowledge for comparing personal and global costs, risks, and utilities. <br>
<p>
Such systems (I would call them "hyper-economies", or<br>
"super-economies") may be implemented in both completely automated<br>
environments and those involving humans (e.g., they could assist people<br>
in selection of things most appropriate for their tastes and situations,<br>
from recommending movies they want to see, to tools that would satisfy<br>
their needs at the best price to choosing diets and insurance plans for<br>
their own goals and conditions). <br>
<p>
There is some analogy here with the notion of "psychohistory"<br>
suggested by Isaac Asimov in his Foundation series, except that instead<br>
of using detailed representations of social processes for long-term<br>
prediction of future events (which is hardly possible with a still very<br>
imperfect model of a huge chaotic system), I suggest a more modest<br>
goal of using them for richer local modelling and adaptive control. The<br>
only advantage here is that this modest goal seems actually achievable. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From research to development</i><br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
I know of a very few people working in similar directions. In the current<br>
situation, good theorists work on conceptualizing existing systems, and<br>
are usually not aware of new developments in software that may create<br>
foundation for new systems and theories. On the other hand, people<br>
working on the first versions of new signalling systems usually do not<br>
have much expertise or interest in complex systems analysis, and spend<br>
their efforts debugging and distributing software. As a result, the new<br>
system structures are arising, once again, unconsciously. <br>
<p>
I am trying to approach this topic from two sides, with some progress in<br>
both, though I feel it is too premature to write about the details yet. <br>
<p>
One, is theoretical considerations of how the new signaling systems may<br>
change our familiar economic notions, such as capital, interest,<br>
efficiency, liquidity, inflation, emission rights, secondary and derivative<br>
instruments. Some of these features will remain relatively unchanged but<br>
become more liquid (faster distribution and lower transaction costs) and<br>
more efficient. Other parameters may turn from scalar to vector or a<br>
more complex structure (e.g., replacement of the numerical<br>
representation of value with a matrix of "value of this object for a<br>
purpose P as estimated by an agent A"). Some features, such as<br>
"situational/detail derivatives" for assessing values and risks of, and<br>
balancing among, particular utilities will be entirely new. <br>
<p>
Similar changes will happen with the concepts from social and<br>
ecological fields. Communities do not have to be local anymore, they<br>
may have variable/adaptable geometries, relations between managing<br>
and performing agencies will be redefined, new control structures and<br>
dynamic patterns arise, etc. <br>
<p>
At the same time, I am working on simple versions of such systems in<br>
Internet environments, where the data is already available, and the<br>
results seem of direct practical use. I am looking for people who would<br>
be interested in helping me develop architectures and algorithms for<br>
such systems. At this point, I can't pay anybody to work on it, but this<br>
is a very promising field, and it may offer very fine student and research<br>
projects. <br>
<p>
Among the first applications of this approach I envision large automated<br>
collaborative filtering projects, link exchange programs and targeted<br>
advertising, balancing flows of information in accordance with diverse<br>
and dynamic interests of creators, consumers, providers, and sponsors<br>
of the Web content. <br>
<p>
My hope is that eventually such hyper-economic schemes will develop<br>
to store and process increasingly complex representations of agent<br>
interests and utilities, and have a great variety of competing intelligent<br>
algorithms for optimizing system processes, thus turning into a hybrid of<br>
an economic self-regulatory mechanism, complex multi-faceted<br>
community, and distributed artificial intelligence, with secondary data<br>
representation and signalling mechanisms forming emerging<br>
self-awareness of the new systems. <br>
