      How To Make People Hate 'The Authorities' _On Principle_<br>

   (Actually, I dare say that many of the Framers of the American <br>

   responsible for attacking Shirley Allen in such a manner.  Is the <br>
   language of .50-caliber _gunfire_ the only language which bullying <br>
   criminals masquerading as 'the authorities' actually _understand_ <br>
   anymore?  We must hope not...  BTW: Cui Bono?  "Follow The Money...").<br>

 <br>
      "We must never forget how Illinois State Police Trampled the U. S. <br>
      Constitution and The Bill of Rights in Roby, Illinois"<br>
 <br>
      By WebToday Staff Writers<br>
 <br>
      Saturday, November 1, 1997, 3:15 p.m. Central Time USA <br>
 <br>
 ROBY, ILLINOIS (November 1, 1997)-- After being assaulted over the <br>
 weekend with nine canisters of police pepper, Shirley Allen was long <br>
 overdue for some fresh air.  After all, Illinois State Police gave their <br>
 word they would not use force any more on her, so perhaps 51-year-old <br>
 widow Shirley Allen believed them.  But when she stepped out of her home <br>
 and on to her porch a group of grown men jumped out of the<br>
 bushes, shot her in the chest with hard rubber bullets, and tackled her.<br>
<p>
 Certainly these bullies couldn't be from the police, could they?<br>
 <br>
 They certainly were. On Thursday, October 30, 1997, the longest police <br>
 siege in Illinois history ended on day 39.<br>
 <br>
 From that point on it was rather routine. Just as Jack Nicholson fought <br>
 the good fight against Nurse Ratchet in One flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest <br>
 only to be given electroshock treatment to the point of becoming a <br>
 compliant vegetable, so Shirley Allen was involuntarily committed to the <br>
 mental wing of St. John's Hospital for "psychiatric evaluation."<br>
<p>
 <br>
 What will become of Shirley Allen only God knows. Having absolutely no<br>
 history of violence, Mrs. Allen's only blemish on her record is a ticket <br>
 for running a stop sign.  Yet her case is sealed and not available to <br>
 reporters or the public.<br>
<p>
<p>
 Associate Judge (not even a full judge) David Slater issued a court order <br>
 (not even a warrant) for the involuntary commitment of Mrs. Allen during <br>
 a hearing she not even allowed to attend in a flagrant end run around the <br>
 Constitution.<br>
<p>
 <br>
 For over 30 days of the siege Mrs. Allen was deprived of food, water,<br>
 electricity, heat, telephone, clergy visits and legal counsel. During <br>
 that time she was was subjected to day and night psychological warfare, <br>
 the likes of which could have put any sane person over the edge, <br>
 including 6 grenades of tear gas, 9 canisters of pepper gas, and a <br>
 cowardly dog attack (that the resourceful Allen countered by<br>
 mercifully shooting he dog through the nose rather than killing it). <br>
<p>
 <br>
 Beyond that, police for many successive days assaulted Allen with sleep<br>
 deprivation techniques including waking her every 15 minutes day and <br>
 night with electronically amplified voices and blaring music that was so <br>
 loud neighbors could hear it two miles away. It was a miracle she <br>
 survived the prolonged torture that eclipsed limits imposed by the Geneva <br>
 Convention for humane treatment of prisoners of war.<br>
<p>
 <br>
 Have the citizens of the United States now become the enemy? How is it <br>
 that government officials have the right to risk driving an allegedly <br>
 suicidal woman to the brink of suicide?  The sad fact remains that we may <br>
 never know how much of Shirley's current mental condition was a direct <br>
 result of nearly of a million dollar taxpayer financed obsessive war game <br>
 waged against a single citizen by Illinois State Police Director Terry <br>
 Gainer.<br>
<p>
 <br>
 Several glaring questions remain during Shirley Allen's closed door<br>
 "evaluation."  Have we learned anything from the 39-nine day siege? Who <br>
 will tend Mrs. Allen's mortgage free 46 acre estate? Who will receive the <br>
 royalties from the oil well on her property? What happened to Mrs. <br>
 Allen's Certificates of Deposit (in excess of $100,000) she inherited <br>
 from her deceased husband? Will any legislator submit legislation to <br>
 reform mental health laws in Illinois? Will Terry Gainer be dismissed<br>
 or promoted? <br>
<p>
 <br>
 We must never forget how Illinois State Police trampled The U. S. <br>
 Constitution and The Bill of Rights in Roby, Illinois from September 22 <br>
 until October 30,  1997.  We must Remember Roby. We must Remember Roby. <br>
 We must...<br>

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
   Practical action steps that may be taken on behalf of Shirley Allen:<br>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
 * Call St. John's Hospital, Springfield (217-544-6464) and ask to speak <br>
 with Shirley. If denied access, ask for the attending physician.  Ask <br>
 them to take into consideration that Shirley had no record of aggressive <br>
 behavior prior to the siege, and that she has been through sleep <br>
 depravation and denied water for over a month, and that any sane person <br>
 might exhibit less than stellar mental health after that ordeal.<br>
<p>
 <br>
 * Ask to speak with Shirley's appointed lawyer and ask if he would<br>
   work with Jerry Spence or any other capable lawyer (or pro se advisor) <br>
   who is willing to help her. <br>
<p>
 * Call Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan to allow Shirley to choose her <br>
   own lawyer, and a psychiatrist rather than state employees who may be<br>
   beholden to the establishment. <br>
<p>
 * Contact Gubernatorial Candidate George Ryan (Currently Secretary of <br>
  State) to intercede on behalf of Shirley. <br>
<p>
 * Call Sangamo County Associate Judge Robert Hall. He is the new<br>
  judge who is involved now. Judge Slater is a Christian County Judge. Now<br>
  Shirley Allen is incarcerated in a psychiatric wing of a Sangamon County <br>
  Hospital.  Judge Hall will set time and date of a sanity hearing against <br>
  Shirley.  He also will appoint a lawyer for her. He has enormous power <br>
  for an Associate Judge (not even a full judge).<br>
 <br>
 *  Demand a jury trial for Shirley. It's her right according to Illinois <br>
    law.  The catch is that she must request it and she probably doesn't<br>
    know it's her right. Ask the judge if he's notified her of that right. <br>
    If not, ask him to notify her of that right immediately.<br>
 <br>
