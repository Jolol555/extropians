<i>&gt; Thanks for all the interesting commentary on this subject.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It has helped me to clarify the nature of my frustration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, while I'm not a libertarian, I'm not opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian philosophy, either. My problem with political</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory and economic theory is general, not directed toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; any particular brand. My problem is that these fields</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not appear to be based on any agreed-upon set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental facts. They differ from disciplines such</i><br>
<i>&gt; as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology, which each</i><br>
<i>&gt; have an agreed-upon basis. Economics and politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; are in the same category of fuzzy science with psychology</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sociology.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure I can totally agree with this statement.  Politics is fuzzy,<br>
no question about it; however, many concepts in economics are built on<br>
strong empirical evidence, just like physics and chemistry.  Economists<br>
even employ the scientific method in the same way.  First, you form a<br>
hypothesis, then you gather data with multiple variables(say the<br>
equilibrium price of two goods, their supply, etc...), then you graph or<br>
compare those variables to look for a relationship.  Any statement you<br>
make connecting those variables is just as strong as a statement<br>
connecting two variables in physics and chemistry.(as long as your<br>
conclusions are verified by multiple sources, just like in other sciences) <br>
It doesn't take a bunch of complicated graphs to see that any intervention<br>
in the free market will cause it to be inefficient.  There's nothing fuzzy<br>
about that. What's fuzzy is the politics: when people say intervening in<br>
the market is *worth* the inefficiencies that is causes.(for the sake of<br>
human rights?  for the sake of people dying in the streets?) To me, that's<br>
pretty fuzzy!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In my opinion, we will continue to disagree about these</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjects, and we will have difficulty making any progress,</i><br>
<i>&gt; until we have an underlying theory with the same predictive</i><br>
<i>&gt; power as evolution in biology, atom theory in chemistry,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or Newton's laws in physics, and plate tectonics in geology.</i><br>
<p>
I would say it economics this is possible.  In politics, it is<br>
impossible.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Since this is true, debate makes little progress. Therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; we (humanity) should spend our time on technical progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This will generate the tools we need to develop more intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We (or our successors) can then figure out the appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; underlying theories for what are now the fuzzy sciences.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think figuring out the fundamentals of economics takes a<br>
super-intelligence; however, extrapolating current economics trends up to<br>
the singularity does.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; There are two types of political commentary that are IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate to this list. The first relates to short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; political activities that affect the short-term rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt; technical progress. For example, an attempt to ban research</i><br>
<i>&gt; on faster computers, or to outlaw strong cryptography, may</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualify.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  I agree, this is something I would like to see more of on the list.<br>
"Ten things you can do to live an anaracho-capitalist life now!"  What are<br>
the current, practical things we can do to not be hypocritical against our<br>
politics(or lack of politics)  I would like to *make the assumption* that<br>
anarcho-capitalism/libertarianism is the best system, and go from there.<br>
<p>
For example, if the government out of the blue offers me a big grant to do<br>
scientific research, do I say "No, I think scientific research should be<br>
funded by private corporations" or do I say "Okay, I'm just getting all<br>
the money back that I pay in taxes" or "I can put this money to better<br>
use than someone else can."  Any ideas?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The second type depends on a belief that the nature</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our successors may depend on our current non-technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs or actions. If you feel that individualism is</i><br>
<i>&gt; important and you want our successor civilization to include</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals, you may wish to discuss how to bring this about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Note, an "individualism is good" post is IMO useless. A post</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing ways to guide the nacent cizilization toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; individualism may be useful.</i><br>
<p>
Which goes along the lines of something John Clark once said (I<br>
paraphrase) : "Anarcho-capitalism has become feasible because we have the<br>
technology to maintain it."  This statement says we have the *potential*<br>
to maintain an anarchy, but how do we actually do it.  Albania(I think)<br>
had an anarchy in the last year(due to a bunch of collapsed pyramid<br>
schemes), but it disappeared.  Why?<br>
 <br>
