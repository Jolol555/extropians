<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The most obvious, or famous, evidence is the New Testament, totally apart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from whether one considers the New Testament to have any religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; validity.  Some (most?) of the books of the New Testament were allegedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written by Apostles of Christ who knew him personally during his life,
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, but most of the books of the New Testament were letters written by
<BR>
Paul, who never met Christ.  The Gospel of Luke, and its sequel, The Acts of
<BR>
the Apostles were also written long after Jesus died, as was The Revelation
<BR>
(Apocalypse) of John.  Only three of the Gospels even claim to have any
<BR>
association with Apostles of Christ, and the best evidence is that they were
<BR>
oral traditions written down 50-150 years afterward.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi (religious teacher),
</EM><BR>
<P>I would like to see some evidence of this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many prophets who came before
</EM><BR>
Mohammed,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Seal of the Prophets (the last prophet).
</EM><BR>
<P>Mohammed was born around 570AD, and died around 632AD.  The writings
<BR>
attributed to him occurred after that date, over 600 years after Christ.
