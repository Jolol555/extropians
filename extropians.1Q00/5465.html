<P>
<EM> &gt; To the extent that any particular foreign policy &quot;hurts&quot; America's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; relationships with its neighbors, it probably helps some influential
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; American special interest, if not the US general populace (which is
</EM><BR>
less
<BR>
<EM> &gt; likely).  And to be bluntly honest, while I whole-heartedly yearn for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; universal prosperity, if my government has a choice between a policy
</EM><BR>
which
<BR>
<EM> &gt; is going to benefit Mexicans and one which is going to benefit
</EM><BR>
Americans, I
<BR>
<EM> &gt; want my government to choose the latter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with that, it is obviously if you have to choose a policy that
<BR>
benefits
<BR>
you more than I, I'll probably do the same. However what about
<BR>
policies that
<BR>
benefit us both?
<BR>
<P>Our relations have improved a great deal over the years and that is in
<BR>
fact
<BR>
because, your government and ours have noticed that our future is
<BR>
completely
<BR>
linked, and that we depend on each other for a successful survival,
<BR>
however
<BR>
there is still a lot to do, specially on sore spots, like drug trade
<BR>
or
<BR>
the migrants issue, I'd like to see how that changes the moment we end
<BR>
70 years of tyranny of the party who is currently in the power, and
<BR>
the
<BR>
chances are we'll kiss good bye the PRI soon. When that happens
<BR>
opposition
<BR>
governments will be more demanding of equal foreign policies, if our
<BR>
economy
<BR>
keeps growing at the rate it has been lately, without another sexenal
<BR>
crisis
<BR>
we'll be in the position to do it.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; Your question (my opinion of US foreign policy) is almost unmanageably
</EM><BR>
broad
<BR>
<EM> &gt; since there is no single US foreign policy, but a whole collection of
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM> &gt; for different interests and different areas of the world.  But
</EM><BR>
generally I'm
<BR>
<EM> &gt; in favor of the US asserting the role of global cop where no other
</EM><BR>
nation or
<BR>
<EM> &gt; organization has the resources or political will to do so.  I'm also
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM> &gt; favor of US attempts to foster democracy and free market capitalism in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM> &gt; world as I personally believe that would be a boon to everyone,
</EM><BR>
particular
<BR>
<EM> &gt; those freed from the confines of communism and totalitarianism.  As to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; specific foreign policy issues such as GATT and NAFTA, I'm really not
</EM><BR>
well
<BR>
<EM> &gt; versed in them and haven't given them much thought.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Hope this helps.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, let's accept that, the U.S. Playing the role of global cop has
<BR>
done good things
<BR>
too, and I value democracy and free market capitalism as much as you,
<BR>
however I think
<BR>
that instead of having a single country playing the role of our global
<BR>
cop, we should have
<BR>
to start a global committee, a lot more effective that the current
<BR>
U.N. That plays
<BR>
the role of a global cop and helps end oppression, communism and
<BR>
totalitarism.
<BR>
<P>Another thing I dislike about the U.S. Foreign policy is that. They
<BR>
appear to be promoting
<BR>
free market capitalism and democracy, however we, their closest
<BR>
neighbors have been ruled
<BR>
by a bunch of authoritarian tyrants, who've done all sorts of crimes
<BR>
ranging from mass murder
<BR>
in the 68, to banning rock concerts or controlling free speech of the
<BR>
media. Not only that
<BR>
if we didn't have to survive under it's control our country's economy
<BR>
would be comparable
<BR>
to the world's most powerful ones, I'm no economy expert, but it's
<BR>
easy to see how has this
<BR>
country grown with the proper administration. However I've never seen
<BR>
the U.S. government
<BR>
saying a single thing and they usually express their preference on the
<BR>
pri candidates, however
<BR>
they assumed a neutral posture these elections, something I consider a
<BR>
very positive change
<BR>
of attitude, specially because the opposition candidate with the
<BR>
highest probability of winning,
<BR>
is going to talk  with Bill Clinton to tell him how we should end with
<BR>
the PRI's regime these elections
<BR>
in the name of democracy, and how the pri's primary elections were a
<BR>
complete fraud.
<BR>
<P>If our bilateral relations continue progressing the way there are now,
<BR>
and we can adequately
<BR>
solve the sore spots (Drug issues, free trade, etc)
<BR>
I predict we'll see unprecedented cooperation between the nations of
<BR>
northamerica
<BR>
(Canada, USA and Mexico) comparable to what we see in Europe, in the
<BR>
near future...
<BR>
and then I'll be the first person in complimenting U.S. Foreign
<BR>
policy.
