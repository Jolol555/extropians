<EM>&gt; &gt;I think that while long term such studies are not perfect, they indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;something.  Also, the particular studies I mentioned are not the only
</EM><BR>
ones.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There are plenty of short term studies with vitamin C where the variables
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are controlled much more fully and other factors are measured (e.g.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;homocysteine levels in blood) and the lot of these seem to point in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;direction of the two I mentioned.  Extrapolation is not forbidden...:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Long term studies, if not &quot;perfect&quot; (i.e. replicable), prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing;  what they &quot;indicate&quot; is in the mind of the believer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true.  Any given study is imperfect.  The fact that the UCLA study was
<BR>
repicable by another independent study (see citations below) shows there is
<BR>
something there.  What it is needs to be studied more closely, but the fact
<BR>
that both studies point in the same direction is notable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; term studies by definition can't tell anything about life extension.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extrapolation is not forbidden in science fiction, but in science...?
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree here.  Granted, short term studies must be handled carefully, but
<BR>
they do indicate something.  Not everything is chaotic nor is everything
<BR>
nonlinear.  If everything was on every scale, then all bets are off period!
<BR>
<P>That said, remember I qualified my statement in the last paragraph.
<BR>
Extropolations must be done with care -- else we wind up with predictions
<BR>
like the world being wall to wall people in X years.  But just because
<BR>
people abuse or, to be charitable, misuse something doesn't mean it can
<BR>
never be used.  In a way, taking aspirin to relieve a headache or for a
<BR>
heart condition is an extropolation.  After all, you are extropolated from
<BR>
the past (in regards to the headache) to the future (that the headache you
<BR>
have now can be cured in the same way as the one you had several months or
<BR>
years ago) or from other studies (in journals, etc.) in which you weren't in
<BR>
the experimental group to yourself.
<BR>
<P>Now, I admit, this sort of thing can lead us astray rather quickly with life
<BR>
extension.  Something which might treat, say, a heart condition now might do
<BR>
cumulative damage to something else over the course of decades of use.  But
<BR>
that's why more studies are done.
<BR>
<P>And lots of long term animal studies have been done too.  (I don't advocate
<BR>
these, but I'm not going to toss out the data to be spiteful.:)  Yes, these
<BR>
are not humans, but if handled right they can be helpful too, especially if
<BR>
the same causal mechanisms apply in humans.  (This is not always the case,
<BR>
which is why we must be _very_ careful here.  I'm sure others on this list
<BR>
who have more training and experience with such things can chime in here.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Also, the mechanisms by which that particular nutrient works are becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more well known.  Ultimately, what one wants is a causal explanation of
</EM><BR>
why
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it works at all.  (This is typically how one finds out why it does not
</EM><BR>
work
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in all cases and how one can develop a regimen.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Your first two sentences appear to contradict each other and  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't understand your third.  Maybe it's just me.
</EM><BR>
<P>They do not.  If X% of the individuals in a study benifit from the
<BR>
supplement and the rest don't, that means, to me, that there are other
<BR>
factors involved -- barring experimental error.  If an adequate causal
<BR>
explanation is found, usually this explains why there is variability in
<BR>
results.  If it does not, I submit the explanation is not adequate.:)
<BR>
Knowing why is better than knowing that in most cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      Please cite the peer-reviewed  studies that appeared in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional journals.
</EM><BR>
<P>The first study I mentioned was in _Epidemiology_ 1992.  The second was in
<BR>
_American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_ 1996.  These are not the only
<BR>
studies I can cite.  I urge interested readers to use MedLine and browse
<BR>
www.lef.org and search the archives of this list and CryoNet for Doug
<BR>
Skrecky posts.
<BR>
<P>One must also be careful even of journals.  One must be careful of the
<BR>
methodologies used.  A recent study of vitamin E did not specify the type
<BR>
used and the fact that the property being studied -- its use in treating
<BR>
heart disease -- was also being treated aggressively in the control group by
<BR>
a perscription drug.  Ergo, the fact that there was little variation between
<BR>
survival rates in both groups can probably be accounted for by the fact that
<BR>
whatever vitamin E does was swamped by the effects of the perscription drug.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Prevention&quot;  and news articles don't count.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never read an issue of _Prevention_.  (Nothing against it, but I've
<BR>
never read it.:)  I do read news items -- who doesn't? -- but I always treat
<BR>
them with skepticism given the Media's penchant for sensationalism and short
<BR>
memory.  (By the latter is meant that rarely do such stories cover more than
<BR>
one study.  Only the latest one is used as if it were in complete isolation
<BR>
from everything else in the universe.  This is why one week a given
<BR>
supplement is a miracle cure for everything, the next it's the worst poison
<BR>
you can purchase without a license.:)
<BR>
<P>Anywya, it is good to see repartee is alive and well on Extropy list.  I
<BR>
would hate to see all of us arguing logically.:)  That would be boring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Also, remember, my original post in this thread was _not_ in advocacy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;popping pills, but of a broad spectrum, informed approach to life
</EM><BR>
extension.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;My goal -- and I hope the goal of all or many of you reading this -- is
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;live longer, healthier, and happier -- not merely to adhere to some
</EM><BR>
doctrine
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of self-medication.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I actually take vitamins myself (just bought more ester-C  today)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I've never heard of a reputable study showing that anything I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take is *harmful*,
</EM><BR>
<P>I have, but Thomas can consider it an exercise in his consultation of the
<BR>
peer-reviewed journals to find out where.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and I can afford to waste the money if they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really help.   I'm still waiting for the research that will &quot;prove&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any vitamin supplement to be helpful for anything,  but I remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (forgive me Robert Owen) a hopeful agnostic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair enough.  Each must judge for her-/him-/it-self.
<BR>
<P>Vivamus!
