<EM>&gt; &gt;Doesn't it seem logical that the fat so released is, at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;temporarily, in the bloodstream?
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeff, I'm not sure this is true.  I need a biochem book to check
<BR>
this and don't have one in Mosow.  It may be that the fat is
<BR>
converted back into glucose before being released to the bloodstream.
<BR>
<P>In brown fat cells, the fat is burned directly by the cells to
<BR>
produce heat.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If this process was understood more precisely, might it not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;possible to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(1) artificially signal the fat cells to release the fat, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(2) divert the blood to a circuit outside the body, where the fat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could be separated (perhaps by centrifuge) and removed?
</EM><BR>
<P>Rather than release the fat, why not just burn it?  A huge
<BR>
chunk of your energy budget goes into temperature maintenance
<BR>
(outside of the tropics).  There are clearly hormonal controls
<BR>
on temperature (look what happens in a fever).  They just need
<BR>
a drug that heightens brown fat cell metabolic activity a few
<BR>
percent and you could watch the fat melt away.  Much less invasive.
<BR>
The possible down side of this is heightened free radical production
<BR>
in the brown fat cells that might eventually damage them to the
<BR>
point of being nonfunctional.
<BR>
<P>Another alternative would be a drug to trigger additional protein
<BR>
breakdown (and re-synthesis). Since this process requires significant
<BR>
amounts of energy, your body would pull the required resources from
<BR>
the fat cells (just as exercise does).  The advantage of this is
<BR>
that the metabolic activity would be more distributed and the
<BR>
pretein recycling would increase the new(undamaged)/old(damaged)
<BR>
protein ratio, leading presumably to a better functioning of the
<BR>
organism.
<BR>
<P>In the next few years we will probably see lots of progress on
<BR>
this area since the targets are clear, the methods exist to screen
<BR>
for the drugs rapidly and the market is so large!
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Twice a month I donate platelets which has the temporary effect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lowering your cholesterol. So perhaps if we discover the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trigger chemical this would induce people to give regularly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Brian, do you have a real reference for this?  I thought platelets
<BR>
were mostly protein, in which case the donation would have a
<BR>
questionable effect on fat.  [Of course there is some in the lipid
<BR>
bilayer, but that seems small.]
