<EM>&gt; Build it big enough, one would suppose, and it would

<P>The point is the recording...
<BR>
It seems like many strange things happen as soon
<BR>
as you are allowed to record and play back a consciousness.
<BR>
The multiple minds arising from the two (surely you
<BR>
must agree that at least some of the other chip-combinations
<BR>
would behave coherent and thus in some sense subjectively 'feel')
<BR>
are only one example.
<BR>
Another:
<BR>
What if I took my neuro-chips and spread them all over the
<BR>
universe (still just playing what I previously recorded, so
<BR>
they would not have to be connected).
<BR>
When would they cease to be an individual? Never?
<BR>
Since the mind itself would stop existing if I destroyed half
<BR>
the chips, would that not mean that the information that they
<BR>
were destroyed would travel faster than light.
<BR>
<P>Hal Finney said something about &quot;counterfactual reliability&quot;,
<BR>
as a way of explaining why one cannot be allowed to record
<BR>
conscious states, but (at least to me) that sounds like
<BR>
resorting to mysticism.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps I should just become an ascriptionist (if the behaviour
<BR>
of something can be more easily predicted by saying it is
<BR>
conscious, then it is conscious) and deny subjectivity (even my own)
<BR>
altogether.
<BR>
It's a compelling thought.
