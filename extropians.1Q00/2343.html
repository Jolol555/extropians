<EM>&gt; Assumption: You refer to Freedom software by Zero-Knowledge Systems, Inc.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And now: Questions, questions...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [0]	   Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc. seems to be Canada based.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   Does the Canadian government allow it to sell &quot;sophisticated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   cryptography&quot; to non-US countries?  If not, the Freedom software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   would become less interesting, wouldn't you say?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that Canada is pretty liberal about crypto exports.  And of
<BR>
course the US has recently relaxed their regulations as well.  So at this
<BR>
point the export restrictions are becoming much less of an issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [1]	   Can one trust their Freedom Network[tm]?
</EM><BR>
<P>I know several of the people involved with this project.  They are
<BR>
committed cypherpunks from way back, and technically very strong.
<BR>
The company has been good about providing white papers explaining the
<BR>
technology, and they even have a whole paper full of nothing but attacks.
<BR>
The system isn't perfect, and some of the features aren't done yet,
<BR>
but once it is fully operational it should be very strong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [2]	   How can one be sure that ZKSI does not collect the data one sends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   through their software, unless one gets the program source?
</EM><BR>
<P>They have made indications about going to some kind of open source
<BR>
model, or at least releasing the source for review.  Supposedly they
<BR>
have a Linux project going as well (currently it is only for Win 95/98).
<BR>
This should help add confidence to the system.
<BR>
