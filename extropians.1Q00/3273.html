Maybe this kind of extreme experience cognitive engineering is going
<BR>
to be a popular thing among the posthumans? A kind of dare, passage
<BR>
rite/education or just entertainment? Of course, pain is just one possible 
<BR>
dimension to experience, one can do the same for pleasure.-

<BR>
<P>I think the kind of neurojacking/total recall technology will be extremely 
<BR>
popular and there will be some extreme uses of it.  Remember the film, 
<BR>
&quot;Brainstorm&quot; gave a very good picture of the various uses and dangers.  If 
<BR>
you have not seen this film I highly recommend it.
<BR>
<P>I could imagine how militaries and covert intelligence agencies would 
<BR>
consider this the ultimate training tool.  It would probably be  cheap as 
<BR>
compared to real world training and could give excellent insights into the 
<BR>
nature of the people being trained.  I wonder though if it would be 100% as 
<BR>
instructive and also convincing as the real world.  I would think so.
<BR>
