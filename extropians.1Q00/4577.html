<EM>&gt;Now, I thought it was supposed to be the evil Micro$ofties that tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treat vaporware like a current feature. :-)  I could say the same thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about Windows with equal accuracy (after all, it runs POSIX applications,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DOS programs, and all the major Unix shells, and Microsoft could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easily slap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other interfaces on top if they wanted to).  The questions are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1) Is there anything decent you can use now (and if you have to compile it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yourself, you've completely missed the point as far as the mass market is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concerned).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2) Is there reason to think that X years of improvement in Linux UIs will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yield better results than X years of improvement in Microsoft UIs?  (And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be nice if the reason amounted to more than 'oh, open source will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;automatically make everything wonderful'.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I don't see this changing anytime soon.  I expect that the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; majority new applications rolled out in the near future will reuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; parts of the existing XML/HTTP infrastructure and be platform neutral.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Some will even be truly innovative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For the client, probably.  But for apps that interact with a database you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can get about a factor of five cost savings by writing the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;app on top
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of COM+ and running it across clusters of cheap boxes, as opposed to going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the one-big-box approach or trying to hand-code a distributed app on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unix.

<P>The whole point of a Unix-based system is the stability that it has.  Having
<BR>
a great UI and crashing every other day (at the very least) is completely
<BR>
missing the point of having a decent box to begin with.  After X years of
<BR>
improvements in Linux UIs will yield better result than x years of develop
<BR>
for microsoft because the Linux UIs will remain stable.  Microsoft continues
<BR>
to build features onto its UIs over buggy software, and in that great cludge
<BR>
of code you only manage to develop more and more bugs to build upon later.
<BR>
<P>Already, scripts are being developed that installation as easy as windows.
<BR>
Look at BSD for ease of use installation right now (for many things at
<BR>
least).  If you're connected to a network, you can run a ./configure which
<BR>
will automatically download and install any dependencies that the program
<BR>
you're trying to install requires as well as install the program that you
<BR>
want.  Unixes are coming at a reasonable towards challenging MS on the user
<BR>
market.  While they won't be here next year, the open-source projects are
<BR>
moving quickly and are gaining a large following.
<BR>
<P>Open source doesn't make linux and its &quot;pals&quot; all hunky-dory, but it does
<BR>
force people to be bug and security conscious in a lot of their code.
