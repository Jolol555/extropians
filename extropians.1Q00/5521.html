|Perhaps, but two points.  One, I'd rather not rely on the incompetence of
<BR>
|any government to make sure I'm free.  Two, the US government is not a
<BR>
|foreign invader (it behaves like one internally and externally, but its, for
<BR>
|we who live here, our own homegrown fascist state) and has a long time to
<BR>
|perfect its policies.  The Nazis didn't have that luxury.
<BR>
<P>One: For me it felt natural to conclude that one should avoid unnecessary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data shadows, since those who believe themselves the ``government''
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will surely use that data against oneself.
<BR>
<P>Two: Apparently those who call themselves ``government'' in the ``USA'' area
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not perfected their methods, considering the fact that they started
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the so called ``War on Drugs'' and have consistently lost it against
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low technology types.  The Norwegian nazis simply reused the old data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collected by the previous people which called themselves ``government''.
<BR>
<P>To stop the spies doing the puzzle, keep your piece.
