<EM>&gt;I should have reminded everyone that *my* odd (?) use of the phrase was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just a direct, unaltered recycling of *Sasha's*. He had written:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(I like reminding people that out of millions of animal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;species, humans are the only one who have any problem seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;each other naked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now I assume that while Sasha is a Russian-American (right?) whose English
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usage therefore might be a bit skewed, Americans surely didn't suppose that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he was saying that humans are plagued by a high frequency of nakedness, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hysterical blindness. He meant, as I meant, that (many/most) humans are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*worried by it*. The difference was that Sasha took this worry to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neurotic; I was trying to situate it in a social context that made it more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understandable/functional. E.g., we worry about people cheating on term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;papers (something few lions or ants get their knickers in a twist abt)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(`knickers' are underpants), not just because we are obsessively anal types but because there's something at stake.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anyway, I'm blaming Sasha for all this. :)

<P>I consider myself not a Russian-American but an individual largely
<BR>
liberated from cultural distinctions, and pride myself in using a
<BR>
goodly Russianalized version of English.  Not having the issues -
<BR>
nor projecting the expectations - of an anal type, I don't have to
<BR>
pay as much attention to keeping my linguistic knickers clean; that
<BR>
can be rather expected from the recognized masters of the language
<BR>
such as Damien, thus making any confusion in the discussion
<BR>
unquestionably *their* fault.
<BR>
<P>As an exception, I would graciously descend to the truly anal style:
<BR>
<P>The general point still is that while cheating on the term papers is
<BR>
analogous to a failure in systemic inheritance in pre-human stages
<BR>
in both nature and consequences, resulting in a major pain in the butt
<BR>
for the subject that botched the learning process, with punishment
<BR>
delivered by a watchful professor or a still more unforgiving predator,
<BR>
in an act that in the human society is much more mild, caring, and better
<BR>
articulated than in cruel Nature, my modest attempt to thoughtfully
<BR>
stroll along Harvard Square in perfectly clean and nicely shaped
<BR>
knickers would be rudely terminated by the authorities with arguments
<BR>
of the sort that there exists regulation saying that such acts should
<BR>
not be committed, and they were specifically told to spend money
<BR>
[forcefully] appropriated from people like me to [forcefully] prevent
<BR>
people from doing such things, and if one person starts walking around
<BR>
in their knickers then others can also start doing that, and that would
<BR>
insult the voting anal types because it is against the law that exists.
<BR>
<P>At which point I get tempted to tell the anal (that's &quot;legal anal&quot;
<BR>
rather than &quot;polemic anal&quot;; I will deny any allegations of having
<BR>
made hints that they are related) guys to shove their law where
<BR>
it belongs, and take my knickers home, with a sad thought that my
<BR>
plans of implanting the second head with a bush of penal attachments
<BR>
may be just a tad premature...
<BR>
<P><P>Why can't one walk three blocks in their normal swimsuit from the Charles
<BR>
River to Harvard Square?  This is such a simple thing!  As long as this
<BR>
is totally unacceptable, how can you expect acceptance of free play
<BR>
with really serious genetic and physical modifications?
