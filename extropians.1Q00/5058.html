<EM>&gt;Maybe, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

<P>The reprocessing plant is on site. It is well sealed and obviously would be 
<BR>
protected by security systems or guards. Entry would be a death sentence 
<BR>
for anyone seeking to steal materials. The real beauty of the IFR scheme is 
<BR>
that none of the fuel, waste, or reprocessed fuel ever leaves the 
<BR>
containment while it still contains fissionable materials.
<BR>
<P><P>(waste reduction)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How is that going to work? OK, a neutron might turn a cobalt 60
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atom into a harmless isotope of nickel but a neutron could also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;turn U238 into plutonium or cause U235 to fission and produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more cobalt 60, or turn common potassium into potassium 40.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some radioactive isotopes thus produced are commercially useful. Cobalt 60 
<BR>
is used in food sterilization, etc.
<BR>
<P>The IFR would never completely solve the issue of radioactive waste, but 
<BR>
would greatly simplify the problem. Besides, what makes radioactive waste 
<BR>
any worse than many organic chemicals that our industry and military 
<BR>
produce in megaton lots? A little intelligence goes a long way here.
<BR>
<P>The volume of high level waste from power plants is tiny compared to the 
<BR>
slag and ash produced by even the cleanest coal burners. This alone makes 
<BR>
the problem much easier to handle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Getting rid of weapons grade plutonium in power plants might be a good idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but you don't need a breeder for that.
</EM><BR>
<P>A few years ago, the local power company, Commonwealth Edison, came out 
<BR>
with a plan to burn something like 5% Pu in their plants. They might as 
<BR>
well advocated burning nuns and orphans from the public and media outcry. 
<BR>
PC thought says the only way to get rid of Pu is to spend billions making 
<BR>
it into glass bricks and burying it over some water table out in Nevada, 
<BR>
next to a fault line.
<BR>
<P>Uranium resources are finite. The breeder simply extends the natural 
<BR>
stockpile. Why throw away the major part of the fuel?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Thousands of tons of plutonium exist on the earth and more is made every day,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but most of it is mixed in with other extremely lethal radioactive waste 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very hard to work with without separating it out in a chemical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reprocessing plant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It only takes a few pounds to make a bomb so I want it hard to work with, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want a reprocessing plant.
</EM><BR>
<P>How are the French doing it? So far, I have heard only about terrorists 
<BR>
getting access to fissionables from places like the old USSR. Never heard 
<BR>
of a problem in France. Of course, it's the kind of news a government would 
<BR>
probably want to suppress...
<BR>
<P>Once we get a viable fusion system running, we can retire fission to an 
<BR>
honorable place in history, as we should already have retired coal burning 
<BR>
power plants.
