<EM>&gt; I'm with Robert on this one.  Open Source is better than the code-and-fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swamp that most software companies have mired themselves in, but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamentally incompatible with any disciplined practice of software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering.  Since the benifits of a modern software engineering system are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much larger than those of open source (there are ducumented instances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productivity gains as large as 600-to-1, and sustained improvements of 20% -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50% per year are commonplace), it is pretty obvious which approach should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; win out.
</EM><BR>
<P>The interesting question is whether the benefits come from &quot;disciplined
<BR>
practices&quot; that are incompatible with open source (why can't
<BR>
open-sourcers be &quot;disciplined&quot;?), or the engineering CASE tools that go
<BR>
along with being the sort of company that engages in disciplined practices.
<BR>
<P>The original question was the power of open-sourced nanotech.  While
<BR>
matter may be software, nanoengineering will not be like software
<BR>
engineering.  For true drextech engineering you'd probably have to *be*
<BR>
Drexler in order to know what you were trying to do, much less do it. 
<BR>
For macroscopic objects built with nanotech, hopefully the very first
<BR>
manufacturing stage and the stage that spacewagons will fall into, you'd
<BR>
have to understand the non-nanotech versions of what you were trying to
<BR>
do, and the basic properties of the materials you were working with, but
<BR>
beyond that your productivity would probably be determined by the tools
<BR>
you had.
<BR>
<P>So for drextech, by which I mean anything that involves engineering
<BR>
complex objects on the molecular level, you'd probably need a dozen
<BR>
incredibly smart people working in the same room.  For macronanotech,
<BR>
open-source would probably work better than closed source, even under
<BR>
Bradbury's set of assumptions.  Why?  Because, although this is just a
<BR>
wild guess, I think the absolute &quot;interactive&quot; complexity (or the amount
<BR>
of complexity that can screw up other complexity) for a spacewagon would
<BR>
be less than the interactive complexity of Linux, meaning that many
<BR>
independent developers could work on individual components.
