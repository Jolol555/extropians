<EM>&gt;Here was a comment about StockGeneration from another mailing list, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reference to a similar operation being started in a few weeks:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The game is to be modeled after StockGeneration. StockGeneration was set up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in a form which would be a legitimate gambling operation IF they played by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their own rules, set up a reserve cash pool to cover the share prices of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their stock, and readjusted the price of the stocks each day as people buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and sell them, to keep their total pool reserves at the same percentage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; total stock capitalization. HOWEVER, in 2 years, they've never dropped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; price of their largest, and, by far, most popular stocks, and so their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liabilities have grown FAR in excess of their assets and now they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; delaying withdrawals by 4 months, and putting several restrictions on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; withdrawals. StockGeneration is now crashing as a ponzi scheme.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As people here noted, Ponzi schemes always end up crashing - usually just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after YOU are invited to join (so you're the one who ends up holding the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bag).
</EM><BR>

<P>While it's certainly possible that SG will come crashing down
<BR>
any minute, there are some inaccuracies above.
<BR>
<P>SG has &quot;rule 13&quot; which enables them to effectively drop the
<BR>
price of some shares in respect of individual players. At the
<BR>
stroke of a pen, they can revalue your portfolio so that your
<BR>
shares #10 &amp; 11 become share #9, wiping out most of your
<BR>
paper profits. The rules also include the ability to drop the
<BR>
price of share #11 to zero at &quot;price-change time.&quot; The rules
<BR>
enable SG to keep outflow less than inflow, possibly for
<BR>
years to come. Rule 13 has been invoked many times to
<BR>
nullify withdrawal requests and to downvalue portfolios.
<BR>
(Though, as far as I know, nobody has lost money with SG.)
<BR>
<P>On Thursday I received my latest withdrawal. It took less
<BR>
than 8 weeks. The average withdrawal time has been steady
<BR>
at around 8 weeks for several months.
<BR>
<P>To now proclaim SG's demise may be premature. In my
<BR>
opinion, the game is brilliantly designed and could continue
<BR>
for several years. I think there's a good probability that this
<BR>
year I'll take $250,000 out of the game.
<BR>
<P>Also not mentioned above is that SG uses some of their
<BR>
capital to generate income that helps pay the returns.
<BR>
<P>A key to SG's potential longevity is the number of means
<BR>
available to them to curtail outflow and keep it below inflow.
<BR>
<P>A key to evaluating a proposition such as SG is rational
<BR>
analysis.
