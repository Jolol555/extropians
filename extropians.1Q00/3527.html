<P>February 25, 2000 —Researchers have found that a signaling protein that is 
<BR>
part of the cell's natural suicide machinery may act as a &quot;messenger of 
<BR>
death&quot; that travels to the cell's nucleus to execute the process of 
<BR>
programmed cell death.
<BR>
<P>Their finding adds an important piece to the puzzle of how malignant, 
<BR>
malfunctioning or unneeded cells are instructed to commit suicide, or 
<BR>
apoptosis, during an organism's development.
<BR>
<P>While the scientists emphasize that there is much more work to be done, they 
<BR>
say that studies of the proteins that cause apoptosis might offer targets for 
<BR>
drugs that can prevent cell death related to heart attacks, strokes, or 
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease.
<BR>
<P>Led by HHMI investigator H. Robert Horvitz at MIT, the research team reported 
<BR>
their discovery in the February 25, 2000, issue of Science. The team also 
<BR>
included scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Chemistry in 
<BR>
Germany and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Programmed cell death is a key mechanism for regulating cell numbers and 
<BR>
connections and for sculpting tissues,&quot; said Horvitz, who was among the 
<BR>
pioneers in discovering the process. &quot;Its misregulation can play a central 
<BR>
role in certain cancers, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. 
<BR>
We now know many of the molecules that control programmed cell death. Our new 
<BR>
finding offers insights as to how one of these key molecules works.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The scientists conducted their research using the transparent nematode worm, 
<BR>
Caenorhabditis elegans, long employed as a model to study apoptosis. The tiny 
<BR>
worm contains exactly 1,090 cells, of which 131 undergo apoptosis, most 
<BR>
during embryonic development.
<BR>
<P>Previous research by Horvitz's team had shown that four proteins —EGL-1, 
<BR>
CED-9, CED-4, and CED-3 —play a central role in the apoptotic machinery. CED 
<BR>
stands for &quot;cell death abnormal.&quot;
<BR>
<P>EGL-1 initiates apoptosis by inhibiting the normal restraining action of 
<BR>
CED-9 on CED-4. Once unleashed from its restraints, CED-4 then triggers 
<BR>
CED-3, which is a highly destructive protein-destroying enzyme that wreaks 
<BR>
havoc on a cell's structures.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Genetic studies of mutant worms that lacked one or another of these proteins 
<BR>
had shown that they affected one another. We wanted to see whether and where 
<BR>
they interact in the cell,&quot; said HHMI predoctoral fellow Bradley Hersh. Thus, 
<BR>
said Hersh, he and his colleagues used antibodies that tagged each protein 
<BR>
involved in apoptosis to reveal their cellular locations. Their experiments 
<BR>
involved eliminating one or another of the signal proteins and studying the 
<BR>
effects on protein localization.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Our initial experiments showed that both CED-9 and CED-4 are localized to 
<BR>
mitochondria,&quot; said Hersh. Mitochondria are the energy-producing powerhouses 
<BR>
of the cell. Some scientists believe that mitochondria are the natural 
<BR>
centers for the &quot;sensors&quot; that trigger programmed cell death, since 
<BR>
malfunctioning mitochondria seriously compromise cell viability.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Once we knew where these two proteins reside normally, the natural thing to 
<BR>
do was look at how they affected the localization of one another,&quot; said 
<BR>
Hersh. &quot;We were surprised to find that that when we eliminated CED-9, CED-4 
<BR>
localization changed to the nucleus. After all, the mammalian counterpart of 
<BR>
CED-4 is found mainly in the cytoplasm, and there was no indication that it 
<BR>
would go to the membrane surrounding the nucleus.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Still mysterious, say Horvitz and Hersh, is how CED-4 reaches the nuclear 
<BR>
membrane. They are studying CED-4 mutants that fail to reach the nucleus. 
<BR>
Such mutants might reveal clues to the transport process and its importance 
<BR>
in cell death.
<BR>
<P>While the discovery of CED-4's translocation to the nuclear membrane is a 
<BR>
basic one, it could have eventual clinical implications, said Hersh.
<BR>
<P>&quot;If CED-4 translocation is required for activation, then inhibiting the 
<BR>
translocation of a human counterpart of CED-4 might block cell death in such 
<BR>
cases as ischemic injury in heart attacks or strokes,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, in 
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease, apoptosis may be central to the death of neurons, and 
<BR>
blocking such a CED-4-like molecule might preserve brain tissue.&quot; However, he 
<BR>
continued, &quot;we still don't know enough about this process to know whether 
<BR>
inhibiting a CED-4-like protein, or translocation in the cell, will be 
<BR>
possible. At this point, inhibiting human CED-3 counterparts, known as 
<BR>
caspases, seems the most promising approach to blocking apoptosis, since 
<BR>
these caspases have an established biochemical activity for which inhibitors 
<BR>
have already been identified.&quot;
