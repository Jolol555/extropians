I get the list as a daily digest and I can remember my finger getting tired 
<BR>
as I scrolled over the LONG posts from you and your antagonists!! lol

I would not shut up because those dogmatic and extreme nimrods attempted to 
<BR>
spambludgeon me into silent acquiescence, and I would NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I empathize with you in wanting to respond each time someone in your view 
<BR>
was being confrontational and yet things got way out of hand.  I can feel 
<BR>
your frustration but think what you should do is try to keep your posts 
<BR>
moderately short and to the point and also provide URL's that would lead to 
<BR>
papers by you on the key points you seem to make over and over.  This way 
<BR>
people new to the list could in detail study out your arguments.  Eliezer 
<BR>
has his website dedicated to the singularity so why not have your own on the 
<BR>
subject of guns and civil rights?

I do not want to see the legitimate evolution and advancement of extropian 
<BR>
ideas and ideals once again drowned out by paramilitary antigoverment

piffle. If you do, that's your business, I guess.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>There are many other people on this list who can stand up for correct ideas 
<BR>
and goals!  You don't need to think only you alone can save the list!  I 
<BR>
don't see the list being &quot;taken over&quot; by these elements.
<BR>
<P>Try not to be Joe &quot;bristling at those who bristle at me&quot; Dees(thanks Daniel 
<BR>
Ust)!  You have intelligence and viewpoints that have the right to be heard 
<BR>
but people do not want a &quot;Flame WAR 2, Joe Dees' strikes back!&quot;  I went 
<BR>
through the extropian digest archives and was awed at the long list of 
<BR>
emails (and length) that was there on the subject.  It brought back 
<BR>
memories.
<BR>
<P>I hope everyone can say &quot;bygones&quot; and not hold grudges against Joe.
<BR>
And I want Joe to continue saying whatever he wants, as with everyone else 
<BR>
here.
<BR>

<BR>
