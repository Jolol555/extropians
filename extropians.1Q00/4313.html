<EM>&gt;Come on, JR, don't get mysty on me.  I'd like an explanation of mind/brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because it'd make me happy.  Little neurotransmitters of satisfaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would begin pumping in my brain if I had one.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't know that something will make you happy until you've experienced it.
<BR>
If you're really in charge of your faculties, you'll make your own happiness
<BR>
instead of letting external factors do it for you.
<BR>
As Lincoln has said, &quot;We're about as happy as we make up our minds to be.&quot;
<BR>
When explanations rely on their ability to satisfy, that's when we get a myriad
<BR>
of explanations, and everyone chooses the one that best satisfies them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, with THAT problem out of the way, I guess we're all set to solve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem of mind?  :p
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;problem&quot;? What problem? Mind requires no explanation.
<BR>
All that is important is the truth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I mean, HONESTLY.
</EM><BR>
<P>We all mean honestly. Very few succeed.
<BR>

<P>-----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the
<BR>
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced
<BR>
by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which
<BR>
states that this has already happened.
