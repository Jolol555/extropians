<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My question has subtle implications, but as MMB notes, it was an axe-blow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now the question was &quot;...wouldn't it be true to say that, by hypothesis,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Freud observed that *everything human* was eroticized?&quot; I found MMB's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post interesting as a poetic device but much too metaphorical to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cited as support for the assertion &quot;there is something or other axiomatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Freud's work that leads to the conclusion that 'if a thing is human, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is eroticized'.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think he cited it as support in any deeply significant way. So,
<BR>
to shed some light, I offer the following
<BR>
Item: Freud's polymorphous perverse infant is (he says) present at (I
<BR>
want to say *as*, but I'm not positive I'm right...) ...present at the
<BR>
start of human consciousness. It is a sexual state (according to him);
<BR>
so QED. It's all sex, all the way down. Even before we know about
<BR>
Thanatos, according to Freud, we have, we *embody*, Eros. And Id (which,
<BR>
I am reliably informed, is &quot;Das Es&quot; in the original German, and a more
<BR>
honest word there, since &quot;Id&quot; has become jargonized in English... &quot;The
<BR>
It&quot; ~= the animal/meat/preconscious/not-human part of the human). Id
<BR>
might not be sexual, but since it's not human, it doesn't count.
<BR>
<P>I thought all this was obvious from pop culture + Psych 101, so I cut to
<BR>
the chase. I didn't mean to disrespect you as a questioner. Sorry for
<BR>
the slam-dunk attitude re: Freud, to the extent that I contributed (and
<BR>
I did). 
<BR>
<P>Respectfully yours,
<BR>
<P>Michael M. Butler
