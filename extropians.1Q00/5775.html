<P><EM>&gt; ABSTRACT:  What daring 21st century concepts or projects would you most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like to see pursued, if money were no object?
</EM><BR>
<P>David:
<BR>
<P>Good to see you here on the list.  I hope you'll be at the Foresight 
<BR>
gathering in May.  Regarding your question about objects of philanthropy and 
<BR>
long-term investment, here are a few of my favorites, some of which I've 
<BR>
sounded off about here before (in one instance quite recently):
<BR>
<P>1.  &quot;Brain Seeds&quot;.  Development of a super-low-cost information 
<BR>
infrastructure for the developing world.  At the end-user level is a robust, 
<BR>
simple and cheap net terminal that can run on a variety of power sources 
<BR>
(solar, wind-up, batteries).  Basic literacy training is hard-coded into it.  
<BR>
Once a user masters some very simple basics, it can plug into the net via a 
<BR>
variety of connections (sat-net, microwave cell, land-line).  Supporting this 
<BR>
access is a distributed education infrastructure that people can volunteer to 
<BR>
participate in to provide basic information in agriculture, public health, 
<BR>
civics and business.  This becomes a kind of &quot;remote Peace Corps&quot; in which 
<BR>
individuals and groups in the developed world can mentor individuals and 
<BR>
villages 
<BR>
<P>The hardware side of this idea is really already a goal of technology 
<BR>
development in the First World, so all that is required is explicit 
<BR>
identification of it as a goal of general human development and its support 
<BR>
by the network of volunteer educators and mentors that could turn it into a 
<BR>
global system of primary education.  Adoption of the over-all program as a 
<BR>
central focus of high-tech philanthropy could serve to energize the 
<BR>
technology-business community of the First World.
<BR>
<P>2.  Micro-Loans.  Closely allied with the &quot;Brain Seed&quot; idea is increased 
<BR>
support for the Grameen Bank style of micro-lending.  Every indication is 
<BR>
that Grameen has identified and developed a really effective tool of 
<BR>
bootstrap development that works well in even the least developed areas of 
<BR>
the world.  It scales well and it provides great synergy with each 
<BR>
incremental improvement in telecommunications infrastructure, as Grammen 
<BR>
Telecommunications is demonstrating in Bangladesh with their program of 
<BR>
providing micro-loans to finance cell phone usage at the village level.
<BR>
<P>3.  Life Extension.  Others have written about this already.  Suffice it to 
<BR>
say that we are within reach of major advances in real life extension 
<BR>
breakthroughs.  Financing both the cultural work of undermining millennia of 
<BR>
&quot;deathist&quot; thinking and the scientific and technical work of reaching the 
<BR>
goal of major life extension breakthroughs within the next 30 years would be 
<BR>
in many ways the single most &quot;humane&quot; use of money one can imagine.  Hundreds 
<BR>
of millions, if not billions of lives could be saved, the equivalent of 
<BR>
avoiding a major world war or global physical catastrophe.  The technical 
<BR>
scientific work IS being done on many fronts, but it could be done faster and 
<BR>
better if the scientists working in the fields could openly talk about the 
<BR>
real goal of life extension, which is still largely taboo.  Financing an 
<BR>
assault on the culture of death would do more to save human lives than any 
<BR>
other philanthropic enterprise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
