<P>Well Eliezer, not everyone may want to be reanimated as an upload.
<BR>
Some of us might want to putter around the galaxy in our interstellar
<BR>
star-hopper until we make some fatal mistake in navigation or alien
<BR>
diplomacy.  Its so much more romantic that way compared with dying
<BR>
a thousand deaths in an SI VR.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The theoretical question is:  &quot;If you know where every single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atom in a frozen brain lies, could you extract an model of the brain's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation with such high resolution that the informational damage caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by freezing would not be significant (on a damage scale calibrated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the effects of neural death and quantum/thermal randomness in day-to-day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation)?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is pretty much the question I'm trying to get at.  Hal responded
<BR>
to some degree expressing his doubts.  From my perspective, the
<BR>
questions are:
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) Does the process of ice crystal formation develop enough force
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to break interatomic bonds or will the crystals almost universally
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disrupt H-bonds and Van der Waals interactions?
<BR>
&nbsp;(b) What is the probability that within a some fixed (sub-cellular) volume
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I will have identical surfaces that preclude putting things back
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together exactly the way they were originally?
<BR>
<P>With regard to (b), I find it hard to believe using nanodis-assemblers
<BR>
that I could not remove all of the ice *entirely* (e.g. creating
<BR>
approximately a freeze-dryed brain), then map all of the surfaces
<BR>
and not discover *exactly* where the various synapses should be
<BR>
positioned and setup the required repair operations.  I'd envision
<BR>
you would have nanobots carefully positioned around the broken
<BR>
pieces, preprogrammed to slowly heat the tissue and execute vector
<BR>
movements designed to properly reposition things.  Only if the damage
<BR>
includes the breaking of covalent bonds [e.g. (a)] does the process of
<BR>
repair become more difficult (having to replace broken chromosomes,
<BR>
proteins, etc.).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think this sounds reasonable; damage to structure on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;10^6-atom-scale may appear to destroy the information contained on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level of abstraction, but the same information should still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obtainable from the internal structure of the mostly-untouched inner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volumes of the 10^6-atom units being shoved around.  If so, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical question is extracting the information without causing exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sort of atomic-scale disruption that would destroy that level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstraction as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since we seem to be able to do this level of &quot;atomic&quot; surface sensing
<BR>
(molecular fingerprint recognition using AFMs) and you have things like
<BR>
laser driven decomposition of surface layers (currently used for things
<BR>
like DNA sequencing via mass-spec), this seems highly feasible to me.
<BR>
Furthermore, taking apart a small number of cells will give you the
<BR>
genetic blueprint (and consequently the 3D blueprint) of all of the
<BR>
molecules (excepting perhaps viruses or nutrients) that should be
<BR>
in the cells.  I see this as no different from paleontology where
<BR>
you can recognize a dinosaur from a fragment of bone sticking out
<BR>
of a rock formation.  My sense of the molecular biology of the brain
<BR>
at this point is that you could probably destroy the contents of
<BR>
every single cell so long as you did a highly accurate inventory.
<BR>
Then once you get all of the cell membranes and synapses in place, you
<BR>
fill the cell with water, repopulate the molecular contents and
<BR>
off you go.
<BR>
<P>The contents of the cell is probably highly flexible as well.
<BR>
I would guess that as long as you get things &quot;balanced&quot; sufficiently
<BR>
that the cells will &quot;run&quot;, you will be ok.  The only places where
<BR>
the contents is important are when you are dealing with internal
<BR>
messangers involved in increasing synaptic strengths.  Since you
<BR>
&quot;died&quot; anyway, it will probably be like coming out of a coma
<BR>
or a very deep sleep, so I suspect any disruption of short term
<BR>
memory formation, because you don't get the molecule counts
<BR>
completely correct, is going to be unimportant.  You might end
<BR>
up being a different person than you would have been had you
<BR>
not undergone the suspension and reanimation but it begs the
<BR>
question of whether or not some of us end up as different persons
<BR>
because we experience high or low blood sugar once or twice a day.
