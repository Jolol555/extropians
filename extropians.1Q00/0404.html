Greg Burch forwards,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; From The Ottawa Citizen Online,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/national/000108/3405758.html">http://www.ottawacitizen.com/national/000108/3405758.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Replacement body parts: Unlike human cloning, Canadians seem to have fewer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethical qualms about the emerging field of research on breeding body parts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still, the public is evenly split on the issue -- a fact that should concern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biotechnologists who might assume that patients would naturally support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They are involved in one of the most promising areas of bioengineering that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could conceivably save the lives of thousands of people awaiting organ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transplants. In labs throughout Canada and the U.S., researchers are making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great strides in their attempts to produce unlimited quantities of skin, eye
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corneas, bone and human organs for grafting and transplantation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pollara found three-quarters of Canadians expect there will be a &quot;market&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for body parts in the next decade. But there is a clear split on whether it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should happen -- 48 per cent in support, and 48 per cent opposed.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me that this question, whether there should be a &quot;market&quot; in
<BR>
body parts, is not quite the same as the broader issue, which is whether
<BR>
people support medical technology that can create replacement body parts.
<BR>
I don't know how the actual survey question was worded, but this talk
<BR>
about a &quot;market&quot; conjures up images of people selling their body parts,
<BR>
which is something that has long been opposed.  I question whether we
<BR>
can take this 48-48 split to apply to medical biotech in general, and
<BR>
artificial organs in particular.
<BR>
<P>One thing I'm not clear about is whether the technology for artificially
<BR>
growing human organs would be based on the user's own tissues, or whether
<BR>
it would be based on someone else's tissue.  The former would be superior
<BR>
in terms of rejection, but it would presumably take longer.  If you need a
<BR>
new liver you may not be able to wait months for one to be grown.  Also,
<BR>
doing it from your own cells would require regressing them to the stem
<BR>
cells stage, which is new technology, whereas getting them from someone
<BR>
else could start with fetal tissue, making the task simpler.
<BR>
<P>These two approaches would likely have very different levels of ethical
<BR>
acceptance from the general public.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Curing disease: Canadians are very optimistic that there will be cures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within the next decade for some of the most deadly diseases that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plagued science. Seventy-four per cent think AIDS will be cured by 2010, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 73 per cent expect a cure for cancer by that year. On a less positive note,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 55 per cent also expect an epidemic worse than AIDS will arise in the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decade.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm surprised they didn't ask how many people support cures for AIDS and
<BR>
cancer.  It's going against God's will, after all...
<BR>
<P>BTW the online prediction game Foresight Exchange <A HREF="http://www.ideosphere.com/">http://www.ideosphere.com/</A>
<BR>
is much more pessimistic about a cure for cancer by 2010, giving it 38%
<BR>
odds, which is more in line with what seems reasonable to me.
<BR>
<P>Hal
