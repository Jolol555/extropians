'What is your name?'  'Technotranscendence.'  'Do you deny having written 
<BR>
the following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are there any web sites out there for people who share our vision of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, but who don't share our political vision -- and who are what we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would classify as fascists or something along those lines?  Sort of like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skinheads, only pro-technoprogress, life extension, space colonization,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotechnology?
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly, though I wish it weren't the case, I don't think there's any
<BR>
correlation b/w one's politics and one's views on technology.  Frankly,
<BR>
it's HARD to find fascists, even online.  (Try it, and see.)  It's also
<BR>
hard to find people who are quite as pro-technology as your average
<BR>
extropian, though that's substantially easier online.  Nonetheless, in
<BR>
light of this, I have thus far failed to find any explicitly
<BR>
pro-technology fascist sites.
<BR>
<P>Of course, it's worthwhile pointing out that fascism is technically
<BR>
authoritarianism + racism, a killer combo.  The few fascist sites that I
<BR>
could find would by and large focus more on the racism than the
<BR>
totalitarianism.  Unfortunately, simple totalitarians are even harder to
<BR>
find than fascists, since they don't self-identify, like the racists do.  
<BR>
<P>Do you look under communism? Many of those endorse anarchocommunism.  (And
<BR>
before any of you start, there IS a significant difference b/w
<BR>
anarchocommunism and fascism.  The one may entail the other, but if you
<BR>
believe A, you don't necessarily believe B, even if A -&gt; B is true.)  Do
<BR>
you look for supporters of a world government?  Supporters of planned
<BR>
societies?  Heck, a search for most of these just turns up hits for sites
<BR>
opposed to all of the above.
