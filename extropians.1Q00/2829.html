<P>
<EM>&gt; Since the topic has gotten around to the crit service, and it seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMHO to be one of the better designed of such systems (I now know of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 5, most used for graffitti), I've been wondering if anyone had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any comments on its design. What does it do right and what does it do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong? How would you change it, and what would be your wish list if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you didn't have to worry about implementation details?
</EM><BR>
<P>None of these services can possibly succeed or make any difference as
<BR>
an independent service, least of all Crit because they have no realistic
<BR>
business model.  There is a way to get annotations working and accepted,
<BR>
though, and that's to make them part of the infrastructure.  The Mozilla
<BR>
project (which everyone mistakenly believes to be a failure when it has
<BR>
made a huge impact and will make a far larger one) provides an opportunity
<BR>
for that (JWZ has already suggested this, but I don't know if anyone's
<BR>
actively working on it).
<BR>
<P>Very few of you will remember that the original NCSA Mosaic web browser
<BR>
(from which Netscape evolved) had a user-annotation feature that stored
<BR>
user comments on a central server.  This feature was removed because it
<BR>
was felt (correctly) that this server would become a bottleneck and
<BR>
become clogged with lots of hard-to-maintain data.  What should be done
<BR>
is to create a standard annotation service interface protocol that all
<BR>
the competing services understand, and add user-level support for the
<BR>
protocol as a standard part of the browser.
<BR>
<P>Here's the user's view: from a web page (seen purely as intended by its
<BR>
author with no Crit-pollution), the user selects the &quot;View Annotations&quot;
<BR>
menu or toolbar button.  A list shows &quot;31 comments at crit.org, 12
<BR>
comments at thirdvoice.com, 5 comments at fredsnotes.net&quot;, etc.  The
<BR>
user selects one of those links, and fredsnotes.net brings up one of
<BR>
its pages--drawn exactly as it wants them drawn, possibly with ads or
<BR>
other gadgets, that contains those comments.  User's comments can be
<BR>
added from those pages, using whatever means the annotation service
<BR>
provides (they'll want to be different so they can control formatting
<BR>
and content and provide value--and yes, the comment servers can and
<BR>
should exercize their own editorial control, which might be none for
<BR>
some services).  The browser will ship with a list of well-known
<BR>
annotation services that support the protocol, and the user will be
<BR>
able to add more or remove ones he doesn't want.
<BR>
<P>I could hack a protocol in a day or two--beyond that we'd need
<BR>
commitment from one or more services to support it and a few folks
<BR>
to put the code into Mozilla.  Netscape 6 will be based on Mozilla,
<BR>
as will other browsers.  If the feature catches on,  MS will have to
<BR>
add it (and there's little reason for them not to--in fact it's an
<BR>
opportunity for them to add their own censored annotation service
<BR>
as well).  After that, it's just part of the Web.
<BR>
<P>The critical keys to success are that PROTOCOL should be open and
<BR>
free, while CONTENT must allow editorial control, or else it will
<BR>
just be a worthless commons.
<BR>
