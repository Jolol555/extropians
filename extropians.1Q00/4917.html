<EM>&gt; [snip my observation about average person pathology]

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No question.  I *absolutely* agree with you.  I just figured it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lot easier to take the gun out of the psychopath's hand than it would be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take the pathology out of his head.  If you think there's a practical way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; legislate against pathology, count me in, I'm all for it.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, clearly the problem of removing guns from a &quot;psychopath's hand&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amazingly difficult to do, as evidenced by the recent threads on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list.  I would venture that it remains to be seen whether or not it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *more* difficult than addressing the underlying causes that precede gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violence against humans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My premise is that guns are just another tool that can be used by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who wishes to do harm or threaten harm to another. Much like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sword, a baseball bat, a crowbar, or fisticuffs, a gun just happens to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the weapon/tool of choice. I think there are two major events that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involve gun usage that has the people who are anti-gun (I use this term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loosely) so passionate about restrictions, banning, safety, etc. First,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the use of a gun by a criminal to perform or threaten an injurious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; act against another. The second is when a person who is naive (usually a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; child) gets a hold of a gun and uses it on another.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The reasons behind the second case occurring seem to involve a lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; education or incapable mental hardware that can not understand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences of these actions. These are the cases where it seems likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that safety mechanisms should be targeted. Education can only go so far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within the mind sets of these individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The first case is much harder to deal with. We can separate these events
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a few, related, but different categories. A] Assassination B]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Criminal intent (i.e., mugging or robbery) C] Killing spree.  These are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by no means exhaustive, but I believe capture the majority of gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deaths/injuries (at least in the US). So, now the question becomes what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the person's reasons for doing the above acts and how can we work to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate or &quot;fix&quot; it such that this will not occur? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Guns are different from the other tools you mention, in that they are 
<BR>
designed to facilitate easy and rapid multiple homicide at a 
<BR>
distance.  Many fewer people are killed per capita in Japan and 
<BR>
Great Britain because the ability to easily and rapidly engage in 
<BR>
single or multiple long distance murder is more closely curtailed 
<BR>
there.  I favor keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals, 
<BR>
proven intimidating abusers, and the mentally incompetent and/or 
<BR>
deranged, and ONLY them.  I have no problem whatsoever with 
<BR>
RESPONSIBLE gun ownership by the general citizenry (I own five 
<BR>
of them).
