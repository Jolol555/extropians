Eric,
<BR>
<P>The item I've pasted after you're your note was posted by Spudboy on
<BR>
03/10/00. It's about a treatment for lung cancer, but maybe it could be used
<BR>
with breast cancer as well. Just in case you missed it. I hope your sister
<BR>
is successfully treated.

<BR>
<P>Hey Everyone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister has breast cancer and now it's spread to her ribs and possibly
<BR>
the spine and the doctor says the clock is really ticking now so we're
<BR>
really
<BR>
looking for any kind of last hope here some kind of experimental treatment
<BR>
or
<BR>
something.  Does anyone know of ANYTHING that can help us out here?
<BR>
Something that may offer some hope.  One last Hail Mary.  Any information
<BR>
will be *greatly* appreciated.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank You So Much To Anyone Who Contributes, Eric
<BR>

<P>New Procedure Destroys Lung Cancer In China Study
<BR>
JACKSON, Mississippi, U.S.A.-All of the PET scans were crystal clear.  Every
<BR>
cancer cell was killed in the targeted zones where lung tumors once had
<BR>
grown.
<BR>
The news was everything that was hoped for by Dr. Patrick Sewell, an
<BR>
assistant professor of radiology and surgery at the University of
<BR>
Mississippi Medical Center (UMC) in Jackson, Miss. The results of his China
<BR>
study confirmed the medical viability of his new pioneering surgical
<BR>
procedure.
<BR>
All nine follow-up PET scans indicate this new procedure is killing 100
<BR>
percent of targeted tumors, Sewell said in a March 7 press conference at the
<BR>
medical center. His final surgery was completed the night of March 3 in
<BR>
Guangzhou (pronounced &quot;gwan-zO&quot;), China, just before his return to Jackson
<BR>
from the 16-day-trip.
<BR>
These findings could give lung cancer patients a favorable alternative to
<BR>
traditional treatments and change the way lung cancer surgery is performed
<BR>
worldwide.
<BR>
Sewell developed the interventional radiology procedure-called
<BR>
radiofrequency of the lung tumor ablation-and is considered the world's
<BR>
authority on it. He performed it for the first time in the world at UMC
<BR>
about a year ago. The Guangzhou, China, Study marked the first time the
<BR>
procedure's effectiveness on primary tumors was tested and the first time
<BR>
follow-up PET scans were performed.
<BR>
&quot;It's so good for the patients,&quot; Sewell explained, &quot;that they can be treated
<BR>
so completely, so quickly, so safely and so cheaply with this procedure.
<BR>
&quot;It makes perfect scientific sense,&quot; he added. &quot;But, emotionally, it's
<BR>
beyond belief to see patients come in and go so quickly and their tumors are
<BR>
treated. Even as much as I believe in this procedure, it's still hard to
<BR>
believe.&quot;
<BR>
Dr. Ralph Vance, an oncologist and UMC professor of medicine, said, &quot;In the
<BR>
20 years I've been treating cancer, this procedure has the potential for
<BR>
being the greatest thing that's ever come about.&quot;
<BR>
Vance accompanied Sewell on the first trip to China, in October, and
<BR>
designed the protocols for the surgeries in the latest trip, which
<BR>
officially is named the Guangzhou, China, Study.
<BR>
The procedure kills cancer with a radiofrequency (hot) probe, which is
<BR>
inserted into tumors and guided by interventional CAT scan images. Within a
<BR>
day or two after their surgeries, all of the China patients had follow-up
<BR>
PET (positron-emission tomography) scans, which detect metabolic activity in
<BR>
live cells, such as cancer cells.
<BR>
The successful results also came earlier than expected in the process.
<BR>
&quot;Initially, we were going to do some of the PET scans early and some in
<BR>
about four months because we didn't know if the immediate scans would
<BR>
provide clear evidence of killed (cancer) cells,&quot; said Dr. Thomas Lawson, a
<BR>
pathologist and director of clinical affairs for Radio Therapeutics Corp.,
<BR>
the U.S. company that manufacturers the probe. &quot;After all, nobody had ever
<BR>
seen a PET scan on thermally treated lung tissue, until now.
<BR>
&quot;But the results were conclusive,&quot; Lawson added, so all of the PET scans
<BR>
were conducted immediately. &quot;There's no reason to wait.&quot; Radio Therapeutics
<BR>
paid for the PET scans, which cost $2,000 each.
<BR>
The Guangzhou, China, Study ideally was to have 10 patients. Sewell saved
<BR>
the 10th patient position for Jackson. He will perform the study's 10th
<BR>
surgery at UMC in the next several weeks.
<BR>
The study's aim was to prove this procedure kills both metastasized (cancer
<BR>
that has spread) and primary (non-metastasized) tumors of the lung. Only
<BR>
tumors that were isolated and surrounded by healthy tissue qualified for the
<BR>
study, so follow-up PET scans could clearly evaluate the treated area.
<BR>
The first PET scan result came in Feb. 26. It showed no metabolic activity
<BR>
in the tumor area treated, nor in the area immediately surrounding the
<BR>
tumor, which also was treated. That indicated all cancer was killed in the
<BR>
targeted zone, Sewell explained then. &quot;There is increased metabolic
<BR>
activity, however, around the dead tumor's location, which is a natural
<BR>
result of the thermal injury&quot; to healthy (non-cancerous) tissue. &quot;This is
<BR>
exactly what we would expect to see,&quot; he said Feb. 26. That ring of
<BR>
metabolic activity around the treated zone was caused by healing of the area
<BR>
heated by the probe.
<BR>
In the year Sewell has performed this procedure at UMC, all but one of his
<BR>
American patients had metastasized lung cancer. One, who underwent surgery
<BR>
shortly before the China trip began, had primary lung cancer. In the United
<BR>
States, primary lung cancer traditionally is treated with conventional
<BR>
surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation.
<BR>
Among the nine Chinese patients: five had primary tumors with no indications
<BR>
of metastasis, two had primary lung tumors with metastasis and two had
<BR>
metastasized cancer that had spread to the lung from other locations.
<BR>
The nine patients, who ranged and age from 38 to 78, had surgeries that
<BR>
lasted from 40 minutes to 4 3/4 hours. Four were women. All were Chinese.
<BR>
Their tumors ranged in size from a dime to a grapefruit.
<BR>
No China patient required general anesthesia. Eight were treated with local
<BR>
anesthesia and one was treated with local anesthesia and heavy sedation.
<BR>
In Sewell's procedure, there is less trauma to the body and a much shorter
<BR>
recovery period than for conventional surgery or chemotherapy. His procedure
<BR>
is much less expensive than conventional surgery and/or chemotherapy. After
<BR>
his procedure, patients usually go home within a day or two.
<BR>
Five of the Chinese patients underwent surgery at the Tumor Hospital of
<BR>
Guangzhou. The other four had their surgeries at one of three Shanghai
<BR>
hospitals. He also lectured physicians in Beijing, Xi'an, Guangzhou and
<BR>
Shanghai. As few as a dozen and as many as five bus loads of Chinese
<BR>
physicians observed each of Sewell's procedures.
<BR>
&quot;We're naming the study for Guangzhou because they were the most
<BR>
enthusiastic and they found the most and the best patients for the study,&quot;
<BR>
Sewell said.  &quot;The also are a hospital devoted to the treatment of tumors.&quot;
