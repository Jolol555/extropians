<EM>&gt; Another alternative would be a drug to trigger additional protein

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fat cells (just as exercise does).  The advantage of this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the metabolic activity would be more distributed and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretein recycling would increase the new(undamaged)/old(damaged)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protein ratio, leading presumably to a better functioning of the

<P>One idea I've been toying with is an implantible device that generates
<BR>
(a little) power from breaking down fat.  It could release the energy
<BR>
outside the body as heat, or - if the infection problems with a device
<BR>
that permanently crosses the skin prove difficult - via induction to
<BR>
some external battery.  If such a device could be built and marketed
<BR>
(perhaps only via prescription at first, to avoid abuse by anorexics),
<BR>
there would seem to be a huge (so to speak) demand for it in the USA
<BR>
alone, easily enough to recover costs of development.
<BR>
<P>This would be version 1 of an implant which could actually do useful
<BR>
things that require electrical energy - for instance, an implanted radio
<BR>
receiver, or maybe a pacemaker - but would never require external
<BR>
charging.  (Granted, such a device would have to be very low power
<BR>
compared to what most devices consume, but there would be non-zero power
<BR>
available...)
<BR>
<P>Now, if only I could find a way to get someone with the necessary
<BR>
biochem knowledge, greed, and resources to build/test/get FDA approval
<BR>
on/sell such a device to consider this idea.
