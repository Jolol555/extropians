<P><EM>&gt; I don't deny that. And if some mathematical 'handles' on this stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were to be created, more work would be done on it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You can do a lot even when the math is not clear, although you sleep
<BR>
better at night when you have a strong theorem to rest on. I should
<BR>
know, since I have been working with Bayesian confidence propagation
<BR>
neural networks with incremental learning and hypercolumns - not even
<BR>
the usual neural network methods work well on them, so I have to rely
<BR>
on experiments and my professor's usually irritatingly correct
<BR>
intuitions.
<BR>
<P>On top of my wish list would be some theorems about the emergence of
<BR>
new attractor states in autoassociative networks seen as dynamical
<BR>
systems - when they pop up, what kinds of bifurcations are there, and
<BR>
how do they depend on learning.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly down on the entire scheme of Neural Nets, due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inability of being able to certify a Neural Net solution as being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable or accurate (All you can do is statistics, proof is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible), but some recent work (which I don't have a pointer to --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wish I did) at automatically converting to/from Neural Nets and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prolog-like languages holds out some hope for not only being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verify that a Neural Net is gonna do what we hope, but that we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually gain the tools to analyze natural neural nets.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you find any references to them, I would be interested in a pointer.
<BR>
<P>Control isn't everything, but I wouldn't want to fly a neural network
<BR>
controlled airplane unless the statistics was *very* good.
