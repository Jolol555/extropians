<EM>&gt;Gardner explains that there is far more to the human intellect then the

<P><P>Recently, he added
<BR>
<EM>&gt;an eighth intelligence to the list: the Naturalist Intelligence.  There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also been some consideration of a ninth intelligence - existential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intelligence - but the jury is still out on that one.
</EM><BR>
<P>Besides, for now at
<BR>
<EM>&gt;least, a great deal of new understanding may be found from within these

<P><P><P>I have to agree with Mr. Lorrey on this. No one has ever denied that these
<BR>
other
<BR>
areas of mental endeavor exist, or that they may be integral to human
<BR>
cognition.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Lorrey's concern, (and mine, when I studied psychology) is that these
<BR>
areas
<BR>
of mental activity are emphatically NOT &quot;intelligence&quot;. &quot;Intelligence&quot;, as
<BR>
coined
<BR>
by Binet when he invented the entire concept of the comparing of one's
<BR>
mental capacities
<BR>
against those of one's peers, never used the word &quot;intelligence&quot; to mean
<BR>
anything
<BR>
EXCEPT mathematical / verbal / abstract symbolic reasoning. That is what
<BR>
&quot;intelligence&quot; is. No aspersion is placed on any of the aforementioned other
<BR>
areas,
<BR>
but it is simply what the word means.
<BR>
<P>Is there any reason, short of Mr Lorrey's hypothesized assault on
<BR>
rationalism, not to
<BR>
refer to these other &quot;intelligences&quot; as what they *are*: abilities.
<BR>
<P>Intelligence, by this meaning, can be understood as one's &quot;mathematical /
<BR>
verbal /
<BR>
abstract symbolic reasoning&quot; ability. What is so wrong with the word
<BR>
&quot;ability&quot;, or
<BR>
so exalted with the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, that we feel the need to redefine
<BR>
abilities as
<BR>
&quot;intelligence&quot;, so as not to cast aspersions on them?
