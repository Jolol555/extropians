<EM>&gt; If you are a nontheist, that means you lack theistic belief. An atheist is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who lacks theistic belief. (&quot;a-&quot; means without.) So, I would say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you *are* an atheist.
</EM><BR>
<P>At first glance this would make non theist and atheist the same, an perhapes
<BR>
an arguement could be made for this based on the pre-fix &quot;non&quot; and &quot;a&quot;.
<BR>
However, historically and connontationally, the difference I draw is that an
<BR>
atheist does not believe in the existence of God, where as a non theist
<BR>
considers the question simply irrelevent. Whether God exists or not is a
<BR>
non-question, in the same way whether Zeus exists or not is a non-question.
<BR>
This is not true of the atheist position as clearly evident in recent
<BR>
postings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can understand why you don't like to describe yourself that way. While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the denotation of the term is correct in your case, you probably dislike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the connotations. &quot;Atheist&quot; has negative connotations in this country.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my youth I was a radical atheist (fortunately not as quite as obnoxious
<BR>
as some views expressed, but I too had my moments) and have no problem with
<BR>
the label as long as it represented my position. However, it does not.
<BR>
Taking a position that I do not believe God exists legitmatizes the question
<BR>
of God's existence. There has been made effort,  thought, and investment at
<BR>
some level of sorting through the arguments and &quot;evidence&quot; in order to
<BR>
arrive at some conclusion. This legitimatizes the question of God's
<BR>
existence  even if arriving at negative conclusion. The atheist is the
<BR>
antithesis of the theist.
<BR>
<P>Based strictly on word analysis I would agree with you, but historically and
<BR>
connotationally I disagree. It is hoped this clarifies things. By the way I
<BR>
appreciate all of your posts on the topic.
