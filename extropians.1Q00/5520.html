<EM>&gt; I personally would have no idea what to do with a supercomputer,

<EM>&gt; besides writing and reading...
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems I've been having this discussion with friends for **years**,
<BR>
or at least ever since the Intel 386 came out in the 80's.  People say,
<BR>
what do individuals need with all that computational power?  Some
<BR>
people seem to have a hard time, even now, imagining a use for a
<BR>
home computer beyond word processing (OK, I guess most folks know
<BR>
about Web surfing by now).
<BR>
<P>Well, I currently have two machines at home.  One is a 300 MHz PII
<BR>
Compaq  downstairs, which was the first modern Windows 95 (now
<BR>
Windows 98 SE) machine I bought in 1997 (I was previously using a 1990
<BR>
Mac Classic accelerated with a 33MHz 68030), and which is now connected
<BR>
to broadband Internet via a cable modem.  Last year I bought the
<BR>
pieces (case, motherboard, etc.) on-line from First Look Computers
<BR>
(www.1look.com) for a second machine (433 MHz Celeron) which is
<BR>
primarily used as the heart of a modest DVD home theater (with
<BR>
a Sony GDM-W900 widescreen monitor, Matrox G400 video card, WinDVD
<BR>
software DVD player, SB Live! soundcard feeding Dolby AC-3
<BR>
to an outboard Sony decoder, etc.).  The two machines are connected
<BR>
with 100BaseTX Ethernet so I can surf the Web from either machine.
<BR>
When idle, both machines (and my desktop machine at work) are running
<BR>
SETI@home.
<BR>
<P>I've played with multimedia with these new machines --
<BR>
digitizing audio and burning audio CD-Rs (with Adaptec software),
<BR>
scanning pictures and printing them out (with HP 6100 scanner,
<BR>
HP color inkjet and ALPS MD5000 thermal transfer color printer,
<BR>
and Adobe Photoshop 5), digital video editing (with a Miro DC30
<BR>
video capture card and Adobe Premiere video editing software),
<BR>
and OCR via the HP scanner and Xerox TextBridge 9.0 (lineal
<BR>
descendant of software originally developed by Ray Kurzweil!)
<BR>
These multimedia applications (and I'm not even talking about
<BR>
games here -- I'm really just an old fogey! -- and no I don't do
<BR>
MP-3 either; I consider myself a serious audiophile, thank you
<BR>
very much! [I did download deCSS as soon as it came out last year,
<BR>
just for the anti-authoritarian thrill of it]) suck up all the
<BR>
CPU cycles and disk speed and capacity you can throw at them,
<BR>
especially recording and playing back digital video (I expect to
<BR>
be using a computer to record HDTV broadcasts one of these days,
<BR>
and a cheap, 80 gigabyte removable optical disk would be really nice).
<BR>
<P>In the Joy/Kurzweil/Turkle radio broadcast on NPR last week
<BR>
(which I only got to hear yesterday via RealAudio from NPR's
<BR>
Web site -- sign of the times), Bill Joy uses as an example of
<BR>
a potentially dangerous technology now available at the corner
<BR>
computer store to any individual with the cash, the new AMD
<BR>
1-gigahertz Athlon processor (Intel now has a similar chip,
<BR>
but Joy mentioned the AMD one specifically).  He points out that
<BR>
this processor has a 1 nanosecond cycle time, whereas the
<BR>
Cray supercomputer he once worked on (safely under central control,
<BR>
and far out of the reach of irresponsible individuals) only
<BR>
had a 25-nanosecond cycle time.  So who's rushing to buy the
<BR>
new AMD 500+ MHz Athlon processors?  Well, the game folks of
<BR>
course, but also the folks who post to www.avsforum.com --
<BR>
playing back DVDs on a computer can always take advantage of
<BR>
the fastest processor available, to provide the headroom for
<BR>
perfectly smooth and natural-looking deinterlacing of DVDs,
<BR>
with nary a dropped frame!  I expect my next computer (in a year
<BR>
or two -- I'm not in any hurry) will contain a &gt; 1 gigahertz
<BR>
processor (AMD or otherwise), and will be used for just that
<BR>
purpose.
<BR>
<P>By the way -- for a transhuman angle to all this -- I consider my
<BR>
multimedia PCs and computer-based home theater to provide a crude
<BR>
form of virtual reality (at this stage, really just a digital
<BR>
replacement for earlier forms of analog media -- never mind the goggles
<BR>
and body suits).  I expect this sort of virtual reality (entertainment
<BR>
for the masses is the supercilious way of looking at it, and notice
<BR>
I didn't even mention pornography -- until now) to be:
<BR>
1) capable of sucking up the most advanced information technology
<BR>
available in the commercial sector for the foreseeable future and
<BR>
2) the most painless and &quot;fun&quot; way for artificial information
<BR>
processing technology (whether intelligent or not) to infiltrate
<BR>
and colonize human civilization (and perhaps even the human nervous
<BR>
system, as Kurzweil suggests in _The Age of Spiritual Machines_).
<BR>
Medical applications, while more noble, are neither painless nor
<BR>
fun (doctors give most people the willies), and the sort of
<BR>
accounting applications that have been the bread-and-butter of
<BR>
information technology ever since the Babylonians started
<BR>
inscribing numbers on clay tablets are dull as dishwater
<BR>
(that's what I do for my employer).
