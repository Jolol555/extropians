<P><EM> &gt; &gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras,
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Hey, no problem. We'll just grow them on trees, or something. Or
<BR>
air-drop them.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; But the vast majority of those cameras would be pointing at a place where
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there aren't any humans, vehicles or robots and so would be worthless. A
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true. Subways and other form of public transportation where a lot
<BR>
of people sequentially pass through a tiny crossection, entrances into
<BR>
buildings/highway systems, street crossings (street lights).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; fairly universal surveillance system (obviously I agree no system will be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; perfect) could get by with a tiny fraction of that number of cameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; particularly if the cameras are mobile.  As for cost, already today you can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; get an (admittedly rubbish quality) web-cam for less than £50, and at that
</EM><BR>
<P>A mass-produced solid-state camera including optics should cost no
<BR>
more than $1, or less. At current state of the art, it would be
<BR>
expensive to equip each of them with image recognition (especially as
<BR>
the current state of art is both puny and advances so fast), so you'd
<BR>
set up distributed DSP surveillance centers.
<BR>
<P>As to limited resolution: unsharp masks. Gait, gesture and movement
<BR>
pattern evaluation do not require a lot of pixels to provide good
<BR>
results. Plus, zoom optics and automatic tracking. You don't have to
<BR>
track the whole crowd simultaneously after you've found your suspect,
<BR>
have you?
<BR>
<P>With sufficient snoopware density, you can track a suspect across wide
<BR>
areas. And of course things grow very interesting if one starts to use
<BR>
data warehouses to crosscorellate data gathered from multiple
<BR>
sources. Very interesting indeed.
<BR>
<P>Then there will be speech recognition, chips which do on-board
<BR>
neuronal OCR, body odor detectors, tags including high-resolution
<BR>
positioning detectors, the whole gamut of it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; price it wouldn't be exhorbitantly expensive to have every room in your
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; house under surveillance. (You may be relieved to hear that I don't have any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; plans to start webcasting Meonthetoilet.com any time soon :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Bummer. And we were hoping ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If that level of surveillance is possible today, I don't think it's a huge
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; stretch to postulate a future system which could cover not just your house,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; but also shops, businesses, public areas etc and at significantly higher
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; quality than the best available  today. Sure, if you decide to go hiking in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the middle of nowhere there won't be any cameras, apart from those you bring
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with you (or ones which follow you if we soup up the tech a bit).
</EM><BR>
<P>LEO stuff can sure track a human moving across a landscape. And
<BR>
helicopter based optics (passive infrared and optical) makes person
<BR>
tracking 1) unavoidable 2) undetectable.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
With nanotechnology one can make surveillance really 100%.
