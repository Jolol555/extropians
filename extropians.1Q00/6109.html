'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;This is certainly as it should be, as it's hard to imagine these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organizations doing their jobs effectively without this sort of secrecy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power proportional 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the little 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the little 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonetheless, the secrecy of our top levels of organization is certainly as
<BR>
it should be, as it's hard to imagine these organizaitons doing their jobs
<BR>
effectively without this sort of secrecy.  This may not have been the
<BR>
point to which you were replying, but it's right anyway.  ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;So ubiquitous surveilance promotes despotism; since despotism is nasty, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the extent that we can prevent ubiquitous surveilance, we should.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, you must have come into the thread late.  You seem to completely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misunderstand (a) what I am proposing and (b) why I think it would be a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea.  I am not necessarily proposing omniscience for the masses.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advocate &quot;transparency.&quot;  There is a difference.  In particular I advocate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power proportional transparency which means that the more power you have to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect the lives of others the more exposed you must be.  Such that if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the designated leader of the free world, you will live under a virtual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microscope with nearly everything about you being recorded and available for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perusal by those whose lives you have the power to effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also propose that the transparency be mutual and two-way, such that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anytime I access any information about you, you can automatically be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notified of (a) what information I got about you, (b) when I got it, (c) how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I got it, (d) who I am, and (e) whatever information I got about you, you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be given about me.  For instance say I looked up Dan Fabulich's home 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address and telephone number.  You would be notified that I did that and you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would, if you wanted, be notified of my home address and telephone number.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You could also be notified of where, when and how I make use of your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the top levels of government are under extreme scrutiny, yet to be
<BR>
scrutinize someone about X, you have to reveal X to the scrutinized, how
<BR>
is it NOT the case that both the top levels of government and the little
<BR>
guy are under extreme scrutiny?  Whoever is fully scrutinizing Clinton is
<BR>
fully scrutinized by Clinton.  It seems that even if your system works
<BR>
flawlessly, the result is simple total surveilance a la Brin, where the
<BR>
cameras are everywhere and anyone who wants to can look at any camera at
<BR>
any time to find out what you're up to right now.
<BR>
<P>How could you guarantee that whatever I learn about you, you learn about
<BR>
me?  If the information is already organized into facts (telephone
<BR>
numbers, addresses, etc.) it's easy to see, but when the question is of
<BR>
the form &quot;are they having sex right now?&quot; it's hard to imagine how a
<BR>
simple system could reveal that to you and reveal that to the targetted
<BR>
party in any useful way, or even answer the question without at least
<BR>
human level intelligence.  The problem gets compounded when I start asking
<BR>
&quot;with whom are they having sex right now?  How?  Are they doing so in the
<BR>
approved way?&quot;  In general, the whole point of surveilance is to detect
<BR>
wrongdoing.  I want to ask &quot;are they commiting a wrongdoing?&quot;  How would a
<BR>
simple system know that?  How could a simple system reveal that to others?
<BR>
<P>Finally, what's stopping the government from using the cameras all the
<BR>
time, with your full knowledge?  Sure, you'd get lots of information about
<BR>
the despot at the head of government, but, it doesn't *matter* how much
<BR>
information you get about the despot; indeed, more information only makes
<BR>
the despot's threats more plausible.  You both know he's a despot making
<BR>
unreasonable demands and that he could squash you like a bug if he felt
<BR>
like it.  How has transparency helped you?
<BR>
