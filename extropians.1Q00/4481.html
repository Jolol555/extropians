<EM>&gt; Now, I thought it was supposed to be the evil Micro$ofties that tried to

<EM>&gt; treat vaporware like a current feature. :-)  I could say the same thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about Windows with equal accuracy (after all, it runs POSIX applications,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DOS programs, and all the major Unix shells, and Microsoft could easily slap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other interfaces on top if they wanted to).  The questions are:
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't arguing that Windows sucks or that Unix is great because in
<BR>
a year or three it will have x, y, and z.  I was arguing against the
<BR>
notion that it would be a horrible thing if most computers ran Unix
<BR>
at some point in the future.
<BR>
<P>I'll admit to knowing basically nothing about Windows internals, but the
<BR>
conventional wisdom is that the OS is pretty tightly coupled to the UI,
<BR>
otherwise why would doing anything on a Windows machine remotely be such
<BR>
a pain?  And even if technically Microsoft could slap completely new
<BR>
interfaces onto Windows easily, they couldn't do anything non-incremental
<BR>
for business reasons.  The installed base is overwhelmingly important.
<BR>
Same applies to Apple.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1) Is there anything decent you can use now (and if you have to compile it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself, you've completely missed the point as far as the mass market is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerned).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, you can use Gnome &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</A>&gt; or KDE
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</A>&gt; right now.  Most Linux distributions ship with one
<BR>
or the other as the default desktop, and easy to install binary packages
<BR>
are available.  To the extent that I care, they already look and feel
<BR>
more or less like Windows and provide roughly the same GUI capabilities.
<BR>
The aforementioned Eazel is really just a project/company (ex-Apple UI
<BR>
people I think) that wants to make Gnome even easier to use.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Is there reason to think that X years of improvement in Linux UIs will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yield better results than X years of improvement in Microsoft UIs?  (And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be nice if the reason amounted to more than 'oh, open source will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automatically make everything wonderful'.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Gnome and KDE have only been around for a few years and are already
<BR>
quite slick.  I will predict that more UI innovation will come from
<BR>
the open source camp than Microsoft or Apple in the future.  Unix is a
<BR>
platform anyone can innovate on, Windows and MacOS are platforms only
<BR>
their corporate owners can innovate on.  However, I'd guess that any
<BR>
real UI innovation won't originate on the traditional desktop (perhaps
<BR>
video games or mobiles).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't see this changing anytime soon.  I expect that the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority new applications rolled out in the near future will reuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parts of the existing XML/HTTP infrastructure and be platform neutral.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Some will even be truly innovative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the client, probably.
</EM><BR>
<P>The server too, for many applications.  While there's some interesting
<BR>
stuff happening on the client, XML and the whole net infrastructure
<BR>
are really enabling the B2B revolution.  Of course when you have N-way
<BR>
communications what qualifies as a client and what qualifies as a server
<BR>
is kind of nebulous.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But for apps that interact with a database you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get about a factor of five cost savings by writing the server app on top
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of COM+ and running it across clusters of cheap boxes, as opposed to going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the one-big-box approach or trying to hand-code a distributed app on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unix.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hand-code what?  Use CORBA.  From my limited vantage point, forget about
<BR>
COM and CORBA, Windows and Unix.  Write everything in Java (now there's
<BR>
a real cost savings vs. C++), abstract your transport, and you can easily
<BR>
plug into COM, CORBA, some fancy message queue, or whatever, easily.
<BR>
