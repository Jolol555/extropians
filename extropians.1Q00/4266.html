<P>Roger that.  Been there and back.  Dont wanna do it again.  Will
<BR>
use my theological training to further rationalism if I possibly can.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...Once this is in place, the reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theological 'high ground', and they will be seen for what they truly are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opressive luddites...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.  Now consider a way we must deal with these people by trying
<BR>
to understand what it must look like from their perspective.  Remember
<BR>
that they all have at least one ability that you and I have not: the ability
<BR>
to totally suspend disbelief.  Considering this, we are proposing a system
<BR>
where their eternal lives are not in the hands of an omnipotent god, but
<BR>
rather in the hands of the medics and technologists who they have never
<BR>
trusted, using a scheme which even we in our more sober moments
<BR>
must admit is scary.  They have the ability to imagine themselves a
<BR>
saviour.  We do not.  We must actually invent ours.
<BR>
<P>But as we will see tomorrow (I fear), the christian hordes swing
<BR>
elections, controlling huge amounts of wealth, influence, power.
<BR>
Our futures may well depend on how well we can get along with
<BR>
and influence the christians.  {8-[  spike

<P>ps Heres something I found on the webnews:
<BR>
<P>NBC ANGERS BIBLE BELT: Pocatello, ID, television station KPVI refuses to air
<BR>
Thursday's debut of God, the Devil and Bob, making it the second NBC
<BR>
affiliate to drop the controversial new animated series (KSL-TV in Salt Lake
<BR>
City is also boycotting). An NBC source told Variety the network expected a
<BR>
few more stations - probably in the Bible Belt - to drop the program as
<BR>
well. Sources also told the paper that NBC execs hope to capitalize on the
<BR>
controversy and may even start promoting the affiliate defections in promos.
