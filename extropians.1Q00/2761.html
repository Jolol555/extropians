<EM>&gt;&gt; Another problem with cancer cryotherapy is that cryotherapy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; tends not to kill *all* the cells.  A few get lucky during the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thaw and one cell is all it takes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since cancers tend to evolve heavily, this might be a way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discovering genes useful for cryopreservation. Just freeze a cultured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tumour, unthaw it, let the surviving cells divide, freeze again, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so on. Eventually you would evolve tumour cells that could deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freezing quite well, and you could start looking for the genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;involved. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a real cute idea.  Even better, cancer cells often 
<BR>
develop resistance by altering regulation of genes, which 
<BR>
creates more opportunities for pharmocological intervention.
<BR>
<P>Vladmir Gelfand did this (for other purposes) while trying
<BR>
to preserve a melanin-producing cell line. Freezing pops
<BR>
the melanin-containing organelles and the release of 
<BR>
melanin kills the cells somehow.  He put the cells through
<BR>
several freeze-thaw cycles; he ended up with a line that
<BR>
adapted by making very little melanin (grey cells, he calls
<BR>
them.)  So it's definitely *possible*, although melanophores
<BR>
are a bit odd freezing-wise.
<BR>
<P>It might be interesting to see if HeLa cells or some other
<BR>
such workhorse has already developed such tendencies (i.e.
<BR>
compare an old frozen line to one that's been through lots
<BR>
of cycles)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The hard part is to do this in vivo rather than in vitro,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since we want cryoprotectant mechanisms that work on tissues rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than single cells.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think a cryopreservation trick might be useful even if
<BR>
you couldn't do full-tissue preservation with that one trick.
<BR>
It's a pretty cheap and painless experiment, anyway.
<BR>
<P>P.S.: The problems with melanophore freezing apply to 
<BR>
human melanophores too.  A successfully revived corpsicle
<BR>
might end up an albino even if the other problems were 
<BR>
successfully resolved.
