<EM>&gt;&gt;I really enjoy being on this list.  I have learned alot and made some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;friends in the bargain.  I am surprised there are not more people on it.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;still feel a little like a &quot;pioneer&quot; by being here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe you *are* a pioneer.  I am sure that in 20-30 years when the viability of strong AI and nanotech start to become evident to the world at large, folks will look back to the archived writings and web pages of some of the people on this list and say &quot;hey, those freaks were right all along!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I had that experience in Russia, where the dissidents were right all
<BR>
along, and for years were not just disbelieved, but in the best cased
<BR>
dismissed and shun, and more often than not, persecuted, and living
<BR>
in fear and poverty.   Now everybody knows they were right all along,
<BR>
but nobody even concentrates on this.  People - the healthy, unscared
<BR>
persecutors and the rest of the crowd who were busy making money and
<BR>
contacts and having fun while the &quot;pioneers&quot; were bleeding for common
<BR>
future - now these people own all the results, and they never pay to,
<BR>
write about, or think of the dissidents.
<BR>
<P>How many of the Internet billionaires are talking, writing, or
<BR>
supporting pioneers of the Web and cryptography?
<BR>
<P>How many times in your life do you hear: &quot;You were right all along.
<BR>
We were dumb.  Now, please have our money&quot;?
<BR>
<P>I know some aging Russian dissidents in Boston who are still discussing
<BR>
who was right when, over tea with cheap cakes bought on foodstamps.
<BR>
Nobody else ever listens.
<BR>
<P>I am for practicism now.  There is little point lamenting that the
<BR>
world is ungrateful.  Not as the main method of self-gratification
<BR>
anyway.   If you are a pioneer, make sure you can benefit from it too.
<BR>
Or if you are an unselfish pioneer, be prepared to be forgotten.
