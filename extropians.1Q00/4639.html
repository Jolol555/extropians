<P><EM>&gt; It would also be nice to see actual models of human behavior that are highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  predictive, especially ones that can not only predict, say, habits or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  genetic stuff, but what the effects of a given change will be.  Granted, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some extent we all have this.  We interact with other people and expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  certain ranges of reactions from them.  We even expect certain norms in 
</EM><BR>
film
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  and fiction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we DO have such models, although, as you point out, we often don't 
<BR>
understand our models much better than we do the more complex (and 
<BR>
&quot;complete&quot;) human systems they model.  We just accept the &quot;output&quot; of those 
<BR>
models on an ad-hoc basis.  Attempts to RIGOROUSLY model human systems are 
<BR>
still in their infancy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; and quite another to develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; PRESCRIPTIVE systems of analysis.  As I've written here before, I do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; any fundamental inconsistency between scientific materialism and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;determinism&quot; on the one hand and the notion that sentient beings are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; actors capable of making (and required to make) moral choices.  In brutal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; summary, my reconciliation of these two notions derives from complexity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; theory: above a certain level of complexity, mental systems cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; accurately enough modeled in practical terms to completely predict their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; behavior, requiring such systems to employ generalizing heuristics that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  map
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; satisfactorily onto a traditional notion of the realm of &quot;ethics&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  There are a few problems here.  One, I question whether materialism is or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can be scientific.  Science is typically taken to be a method of gaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  knowledge or knowledge gained via that method.  Materialism is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ontological position.  I'm not claiming the twain never doth meet, just 
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  one does not imply the other.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose you're right - one could be a &quot;scientific spiritualist&quot; or a 
<BR>
&quot;superstitious materialist&quot;.  But it seems that, from a pragmatic point of 
<BR>
view, scientific materialism yields the best predictive results in our lives.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Two, the problem for morality of determinism is not about prediction per 
</EM><BR>
se,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  but about responsibility and choice.  To wit, if an alleged actor cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  choose any of her actions, then the typical -- and, to me, correct -- view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is that she's not responsible for her actions.  In other words, we can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  praise or blame her for doing right or wrong, good or ill, this or that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But that does not exhaust morality either.  After all, intentions as well 
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  actions and results have to come into play.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that a rigorous determinist has to give up the notion of personal 
<BR>
moral responsibility.  If I were a classical determinist, I suppose I would 
<BR>
come to that conclusion - and promptly become an existentialist nihilist (a 
<BR>
conclusion to which much of Western culture came in the 20th century).  But 
<BR>
I'm not, so I don't.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Three, the complexity argument doesn't resolve the issue the way Greg wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it to be resolved -- with all sides being right and everything taken up 
</EM><BR>
into
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  to some greater whole.  Instead, if a system is deterministic, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  deterministic, whether to itself it cannot be modeled or not.  (I would 
</EM><BR>
also
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  submit that when we model our and other people's actions, we need not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  complete or total -- any more than in trying to predict where to point the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cameras on the Galileo probe presumes a complete knowledge of celestial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  happenings.  But that's what Greg meant by &quot;generalizing heuristics,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  right?:)
</EM><BR>
<P>That is what I meant.  But I've come to the tentative conclusion that it's 
<BR>
not just an accident of our current state of knowledge that we have to use 
<BR>
imperfect models and moral heuristics to guide our actions.  I think it's a 
<BR>
fundamental fact of life for complex minds: They can't model themselves or 
<BR>
other such minds completely (much less GROUPS of such minds), so there will 
<BR>
always be an irreducible core of activity that will be within what we now 
<BR>
call the realm of moral philosophy and ethics.  Thus, as the complexity of a 
<BR>
system to be treated as a potential moral object increases (relative to the 
<BR>
moral SUBJECT'S ability to accurately emulate and model it), the more that 
<BR>
system MUST be treated as a moral object.
<BR>
<P>I know this statement has implications for the discussion Robert Bradbury and 
<BR>
I were having about &quot;the ethics of godhood&quot; a couple of months ago (?), but I 
<BR>
resolve that with another &quot;moral axiom&quot; based on a notion of &quot;reflexivity of 
<BR>
moral subjecthood&quot;: An entity that must act as a moral subject within its own 
<BR>
realm should be treated as a moral object by &quot;superior&quot; beings (i.e. beings 
<BR>
more capable of predicting its behavior deterministically) as a &quot;meta-rule&quot; 
<BR>
(i.e. the Golden Rule as a sort of irreducible ethical &quot;operating system&quot;)
<BR>
<P>I know the above is VERY opaque - but that's because I haven't found the time 
<BR>
to write the book that explains it all in more detail :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  That a system is complex does not clear up everything either.  After all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  paradigmatic complex systems tend to magnify small pertubations.  That 
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  so, imagine a determined determinist who despite his scrutiny overlooks one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  small disturbance that happens to be completely undetermined.  Soon, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  disturbance might affect the whole system.  What I'm saying is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  complexity should make us a little humble -- though we should not retreat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  before it like some savage before a graven idol.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>And what I'm saying is that this humility you mention is actually the &quot;engine 
<BR>
of morality&quot;.
