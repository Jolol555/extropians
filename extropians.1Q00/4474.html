<P><EM> &gt; *All* respects?  Not quite.  There is nothing in Unix-land (or anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; else, AFAIK) that even begins to compare with the capabilities of COM+ for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; writing distributed applications.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
So tell us, why and how is COM+ better than MPI or PVM, or any of the
<BR>
newer funky userland active-messages efforts. Stability? Availability?
<BR>
Throughput? Latency? (of what sense is this if task response time
<BR>
itself sucks due all the massive OS code bloat). Excellent support?
<BR>
Because there is so much already written well debugged code for COM+,
<BR>
since it has been with us since time immemorial?  Because COM+ is an
<BR>
open (comes with source), uncorruptible standard, not linked to a
<BR>
single OS, with well-documented track of absolutely corrupt (let's
<BR>
call it outright evil) business practises?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Now, I thought it was supposed to be the evil Micro$ofties that tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; treat vaporware like a current feature. :-)  I could say the same thing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about Windows with equal accuracy (after all, it runs POSIX applications,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; DOS programs, and all the major Unix shells, and Microsoft could easily slap
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other interfaces on top if they wanted to).  The questions are:
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The POSIX compliancy thing is a joke, as you well know. According to
<BR>
the test suite, my CP/M system as well as my pet rat are fully POSIX
<BR>
compliant. I'm not particularly interested in DOS programs, because
<BR>
they typically do not come with source, and are built to fit into DOS'
<BR>
limitations. There is little point in looking for bash for Win98 on
<BR>
OpenSource software depository for Windows (which hasn't any
<BR>
OpenSource followship worth speaking of, and no central
<BR>
depository). And we all know what we can expect Microsoft to do:
<BR>
largely nothing (with the exception of profit maximisation), as is
<BR>
monopolies' wont.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I can't afford to run M$ OS due to their notoriously lousy
<BR>
securety and stability problems. As an illustration, I could have made
<BR>
this (plain text) mail invisible to M$ Outlook users, by using a
<BR>
pretty innocuous phrase like begin followed by two blanks (and maybe a
<BR>
comma) at the beginning of this message. Or crashed anybody's M$ box
<BR>
who still thinks that running M$ OS and using browser in HTML
<BR>
rendering mode for reading mail is a smart idea, by embedding a
<BR>
file:// URL referring to local driver combination. Hahah. How funny.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 1) Is there anything decent you can use now (and if you have to compile it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; yourself, you've completely missed the point as far as the mass market is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; concerned).
</EM><BR>
<P>I could hardly care less about mass market (I make no illusions about
<BR>
me being an average user). God, if Linux is one day truly successfull
<BR>
one has to create protection mechanism against damage done by
<BR>
stampeding masses of well-meaning, but clueless idiots, and aggressive
<BR>
commercial efforts to usurp development, including such universally
<BR>
well-liked practices like silently sneaking user web behaviour
<BR>
tracking trojans into your streaming multimedia player, and
<BR>
government-mandated remotely exploitable back doors (thanks for that
<BR>
go to that J. Reno bitch). One would have to use cryptographic
<BR>
authentication linked to authorities and massive code reviews against
<BR>
evermounting attempts to corrupt code. What a fucking nightmare. We
<BR>
need a crisis management group against OpenSource corruption, asap. It
<BR>
probably has already begun.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 2) Is there reason to think that X years of improvement in Linux UIs will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; yield better results than X years of improvement in Microsoft UIs?  (And it
</EM><BR>
<P>You think you can improve a text console?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; would be nice if the reason amounted to more than 'oh, open source will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; automatically make everything wonderful'.)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
X-Windows is not an UI. Why must I resort to third party products like
<BR>
BackOrifice 2k or PcAnywhere to do anything remotely over the network?
<BR>
God, if I start to enumerate what is right with Linux and wrong with
<BR>
Microsoft this would take me the whole week. My god, recently these
<BR>
jokers thought putting executable code into the friggin' _file system_
<BR>
was a monstrously smart idea, in M$'s attempt to reinvent symbolic
<BR>
links. &lt;/throwing hands up in exasperation&gt;. 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; I don't see this changing anytime soon.  I expect that the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; majority new applications rolled out in the near future will reuse
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; parts of the existing XML/HTTP infrastructure and be platform neutral.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Some will even be truly innovative.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; For the client, probably.  But for apps that interact with a database you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can get about a factor of five cost savings by writing the server app on top
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of COM+ and running it across clusters of cheap boxes, as opposed to going
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, yes, M$ has now invented the Beowulf.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; with the one-big-box approach or trying to hand-code a distributed app on
</EM><BR>
<P>Er, you should have noticed that the one-big-box is profoundly
<BR>
obsolete, at least outside the M$'s technology circle.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Unix.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have always hand-code a distributed app, because there is no magic
<BR>
which makes a monolithic application distributed.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong, there's plenty wrong with Unix. I don't like its
<BR>
monolithic, increasingly subject to code-bloat approach. Much would be
<BR>
gained if a tiny-memory-footprint realtime nanokernel with excellent
<BR>
message passing support would surpass Linux (QNX, L4 would seem to
<BR>
move in the right direction). Why can't a 2-8 kByte core image
<BR>
nanokernel be handcoded in assembly? I would like to see hardware
<BR>
threaded code support for steeper abstraction gradients, including
<BR>
languages supporting it, stack processors, reconfigurable processors
<BR>
and eventually totally dynamically reconfigurable hardware a la CA
<BR>
machines. Emulating Linux on such architectures is certainly
<BR>
unbearable cruft, so it has to die on the way there.
<BR>
<P>Trying to discuss M$ offerings in the context of OpenSource is
<BR>
ridiculous. It's a totally different league.
