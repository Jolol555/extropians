<P><EM>&gt;In the early 70's Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead addressed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different classes I was attending at the University of Western
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ontario.  Bateson lectured about cybernetics, and the &quot;double
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bind&quot; theory as a cause of schizophrenia, and everything in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between, in an hour or so.  Mead, sometime in the same semester,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;addressed one of my anthropology classes. Coincidently, if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remember correctly, they had recently separated from some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a relationship.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bateson and Mead were married for a time.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I had enrolled at UWO to study linguistics and anthropology with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the single objective of returning to the &quot;mission field&quot; as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bible translator to indigenous jungle people (as I've mentioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before).  In the brief encounters I had with Bateson and Mead, my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind, for twenty odd years locked more securely than any chastity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;belt, was pried open.  I was astounded by the scope of reference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each so comfortably, and easily drew from.  They gave me curiosity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the joy of questions.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I concur, When I read Bateson's &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; I was so
<BR>
astonished I began to reread it as soon as I had finished the first
<BR>
reading, I read it again several times in the following months.
<BR>
<P>He opened my mind further than anyone else with the possible
<BR>
exception of R. Buckminster Fuller.
