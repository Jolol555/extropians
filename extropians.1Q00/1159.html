<EM>&gt; Isn't a late-term fetus (last trimester) to be honest a... baby?  Semantics

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its a semenatic issue.  The collection of information contained in
<BR>
a late-term fetus (leaving aside the question of information growth
<BR>
due to the experience of the parents), probably falls into the category
<BR>
of semi-easily reproducible.  On the other hand the information
<BR>
contained in a 2 year old is many many orders of magnitude above this.
<BR>
<P>Instead of pushing the valuation back towards the younger end of the
<BR>
spectrum, it is probably much more rational to push it *ahead*
<BR>
to the older end of the spectrum (though this flies in the face
<BR>
of the emotional ties that soft wet cuddly babies generate).
<BR>
<P>I'd suspect that the first year or so of life is primarily involved
<BR>
in neural outgrowth laying the foundation for the huge pattern
<BR>
accumulation that is occurs in the 1-3 y.o. stage.  Once you have in place
<BR>
the foundation for locomotion and speech recognition and production
<BR>
then the rate of accumulation of difficult-to-reproduce information
<BR>
goes up substantially (as would rational valuations on the proto-human).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I remember reading about a controversial philosophy professor who has put 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward the idea that children up to a certain time after birth should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under &quot;probation&quot; as to whether or not they are allowed to live by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents.  There have been protests at the college that recently hired him to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to kick him out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Irrational people know no limits.  Seems like a reasonable and logical
<BR>
strategy to me.  Though it depends what he uses to judge the &quot;probation&quot;
<BR>
period.  Past problems with gene defects (that might provide a rationale
<BR>
due to the &quot;poor investment&quot;) will soon be correctable.  So the question
<BR>
is how do you decide who has a right to life and who doesn't??
<BR>
<P>[Oh the thought police are going to get me for that comment...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course ancient cultures like the Spartans and also I believe the Vikings 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did this.  But they were warrior societies that wanted only the fit to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survive to produce the best fighters and parents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe the current investment in Western countries for raising
<BR>
children to adulthood is running around $500K.  For that price those
<BR>
babies had better be giving you a *lot* of emotional &quot;stroking&quot;.
<BR>
If you can't get that stroking (from a retarded or autistic child
<BR>
for example), then the only rationalization is compassion.  As the
<BR>
state of the world shows, compassion is a limited resource and
<BR>
people should look a little more closely at how they allocate theirs.
<BR>
<P>[Please don't flame me for the above, I have a huge amount of compassion
<BR>
but I tend to allocate mine towards humanity in general rather than
<BR>
specific instances of humanity.]
