<EM>&gt; &gt; some form or another regretting ever wanting to live

</EM><BR>
The vampire myth is a classic example of this.  Live forever with incredible 
<BR>
powers but at the price of being a moral monster and never seeing the sun 
<BR>
again.  I think this whole societal cliche has to do with a &quot;sour grapes&quot; 
<BR>
syndrome where we try to explain why the present order is the best way due 
<BR>
to not being able to change it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ja.  Bill Murray in Groundhogs Day.  Finds he is cursed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;live the same day over and over.  Pretty soon he is struggling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to figure out a way to kill himself or end it all somehow.  Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually a pretty entertaining movie, if you can get used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Murray in kind of a semi-serious role.
</EM><BR>
Actually that movie is not nearly as bad as others. For instance,
<BR>
after he figures out he can't kill himself off, Murray's char
<BR>
goes on to spend his time learning new skills and otherwise
<BR>
improving himself in order to reach his goal.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I loved Groundhog Day.  I would love to be able to hit the &quot;reset button&quot; 
<BR>
and see how many different ways I could approach a situation and what the 
<BR>
consequences would be, without permanent consequences like in real life.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
