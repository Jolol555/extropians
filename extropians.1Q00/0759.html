<P><EM>    &gt;Now, what gets interesting is the problem of seeing those black holes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Nanoprobes (or even non-nanoprobes) may have a hard time detecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;them early enough to avoid falling into or being irradiated by them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;The question is whether you have to have a Chandra-mass telescope to focus
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the incoming X-rays?  If so, you are definately no longer a nano-probe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;So, we have yet another possible problem in the realm of interstellar
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;travel (in addition to cosmic radiation and hitting dust particles).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that's a serious problem. A stellar black hole is only about 15 miles
<BR>
in circumference (black holes don't have a meaningful radius) so the chance of
<BR>
hitting one directly by accident is almost nil, and a probe moving at 2% of the
<BR>
speed of light a near direct hit is what you'd need to get into trouble.
<BR>
A super massive black hole is a little larger, about the size of the solar system,
<BR>
but there are probably only one or two this big per galaxy and so can be avoided.
<BR>
<P>Chandra just discovered the closest known black hole to earth, it's
<BR>
1600 light years away. What would be really interesting is if it can find
<BR>
any mini black holes, those about as massive as a mountain and made in the
<BR>
first second of the Big Bang. Such a beast would be super hot but so tiny that
<BR>
it would not be very bright, if one is found it would have be nearby and that
<BR>
would mean mini black holes are common.
