<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyone interested?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Certainly, so long as it doesn't get inundated by anarchists who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;closet socialists (the whole Eugene gang).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I feel the need to butt in with my two cents worth here.  In &quot;left&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchist thought, two very different definitions of socialism are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognized.  The first, &quot;state socialism&quot;, is the familiar authoritarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marxist kind that we're all familiar with, and the second (in opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot; . . . To quote Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism is 'the no-government system of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialism.' [Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets, p. 46]. In other words,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'the abolition of exploitation and oppression of man by man, that is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abolition of private property [i.e. capitalism] and government.' [Errico
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Malatesta, 'Towards Anarchism,' in Man!, M. Graham (Ed), p. 75]&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Vague pronouncements without thinking things through to their proper
<BR>
conclusion.  Property are real goods acquired by an individual in
<BR>
exchange for the labor of the individual. Abolishing property abolishes
<BR>
the principle that an individual has a right to be paid for his labor,
<BR>
which results in slavery.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Anarchism, therefore, is a political theory that aims to create a society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system and so work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equality. They see the goals of liberty and equality as mutually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-supporting. Or, in Bakunin's famous dictum:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      'We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 269]&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Pure double speak. As noted above, the abolition of property is the
<BR>
enslavement of the individual, therefore, socialism is a state of a lack
<BR>
of freedom of the individual. Freedom and socialism cannot co-exist,
<BR>
revealing why the term 'anarcho-socialism' is an oxymoron.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot; . . . rather than being purely anti-government or anti-state, anarchism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primarily a movement against hierarchy. Why? Because hierarchy is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisational structure that embodies authority. Since the state is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;highest&quot; form of hierarchy, anarchists are, by definition, anti-state; but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is not a sufficient definition of anarchism. This means that real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchists are opposed to all forms of hierarchical organisation, not only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state. . . .&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine and good. Rather than a heirarchy, have an economic system
<BR>
structured on networks rather than heirarchies. How are individuals to
<BR>
be rewarded for their labor, and how are individuals to be able to save
<BR>
the fruit of their labor without the concept of property? If anyone has
<BR>
the right to go and take the property savings of an individual, how is
<BR>
the individual to be motivated to produce at a rate greater than a mere
<BR>
subsistence level?
<BR>
<P>These are the questions that pie eyed 'socialists' refuse to answer
<BR>
because it exposes that their plan has no clothes.
