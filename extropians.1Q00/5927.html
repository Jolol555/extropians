<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; There's also the question of whether the indiginous population would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; welcome the reinstatement of imperialist external rule.  Most of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; countries worked hard to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Economically many countries are worse off, but it would be a terrible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; blow to their pride to ask for the hated rulers to come back in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; start running things again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you have an apartment house that you aren't managing well, you can hire a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; management company to do it for you.  There are cities that contract out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ambulance services, garbage collection, and even fire fighting services, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; order to save money.  Why not contract out the entire government to a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporation who could manage the country professionally?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An interesting idea, but how would you keep these new governments from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passing laws that lock out all competitors, to prevent replacement in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case they themselves become corrupt (or were corrupt all along)?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments are restricted from passing laws...well, nobody's perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (yet), and neither are any existing set of laws, so who gets to debug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever legal system people come up with as the flaws are found?
</EM><BR>
<P>These issues have been dealt with before, and that is why constitutions have
<BR>
been developed.  Code the rights of the people and the duties of the corporation
<BR>
into an unchangeable constitution.  But allow sensible regulations to be passed
<BR>
by the corporation, dealing with day to day matters.
<BR>
<P>The nice thing about it, is that people will no longer have to deal with
<BR>
political issues.  Right now, if you don't like your ISP, you sign up with
<BR>
another ISP.  You don't concern yourself with who the president of your ISP is,
<BR>
how your ISP budgets its money, or attend the board meetings that your ISP has.
