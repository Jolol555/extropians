<P><EM>&gt; Close readers of the list will know that I am one of the most vocal and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consistent worriers about opposition to transhumanism.  Ruminating (some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might say obsessing) about this over the holiday, I've decided that a more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systematic approach to concern about sources of opposition to our ideals and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goals is necessary.  To this end, I've begun work on a website in which I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will collect links to groups and resources that appear to present a current 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or potential threat to the transhumanist agenda.
</EM><BR>
<P>A good idea. It might be useful to add more information on which memes
<BR>
each group promotes that are counter-transhumanistic, although this is maybe
<BR>
the second step after compiling a good starting list of anti-progress
<BR>
groups. 
<BR>
<P>I have been planning to make an opposition page for a long time, with
<BR>
links to transhumanism-critical pages and my (or others')
<BR>
comments/refutations/acknowledgements to them. However, this is
<BR>
broader and more relevant on a &quot;strategic&quot; level.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if enemies of progress is the right term really. The view
<BR>
that we are making progress is also criticized severely within much of
<BR>
postmodern thought, but most of it doesn't seem to belong on the
<BR>
list. Perhaps a better definition of who/what should be on the list is
<BR>
that they are moving against science, technology, reason and human
<BR>
liberty.
