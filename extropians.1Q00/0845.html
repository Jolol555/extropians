<P><EM>&gt;  rephrase: can you give me *ONE* single example of a case where, using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  criticism as your only tool, you succeed in ADDING TO the body of 
</EM><BR>
knowledge 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  stored in your mind ? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I can think of two right off hand: 1) Halley's comet falsification of 
<BR>
Newtonian mechanics and 2) warping of space-time (Einstein) falsification of 
<BR>
1919.  These two are commonly used as examples of deductive reasoning 
<BR>
over-throwing an old theory yet _not_ proving the new theory.  Both events 
<BR>
met the requirements of conjecture and refutation (falsification) of Popper, 
<BR>
and survived yet the knowledge came from the other direction (refutation of 
<BR>
theory, NOT PROOF).  
<BR>
<P>In the first case a very specific prediction was made (a comet will return in 
<BR>
December  1758, in a certain sky location) that if did not come true, that 
<BR>
would have crippled if not destroyed orbital calculation using Newtonian 
<BR>
mechanics, but instead the comte returned and destroyed the proviously 
<BR>
allegedly &quot;true&quot; theory of Ptolomy/Aristotle/.  
<BR>
<P>In the second case, Einstein's theories could have been destroyed, but the 
<BR>
idea of universal quantity call &quot;time&quot; was destroyed instead.  Later this 
<BR>
happened with mass and velocity no longer beeing thought of a changeless. 
<BR>
<P>So the threatened destruction of one resulted in destruction of an erroneous 
<BR>
explanation and knowledge increased.  No one said that the new theory was 
<BR>
&quot;true&quot; after the tesing.  That is the philosophically important part of 
<BR>
deduction (opposed to induction). [1]  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From this unification also increases knowledge by generating a plethora of 
</EM><BR>
new conjectures.   This is called &quot;fruitfullness&quot; in the philosophy of 
<BR>
science's theory on generation of new knowledge.  The survivors then add to 
<BR>
knowledge themselves built on top of the destruction.  This is also called 
<BR>
the &quot;dynamical&quot; character or the &quot;fertility&quot; of the theory (Frank, Philipp, 
<BR>
in Klemke, et al.1998, 467).
<BR>
<P>There are many such example where the new theory is not proven, yet the old 
<BR>
theory is destroyed and knowledge increases: Koch's postulates vs. 
<BR>
spontaneous generation, Darwinism vs. Creationism,  Astronomy vs. Astrology,  
<BR>
(Is this not happening with science in general vs. religion in general?).
<BR>
<P>Notebly this has not happened with: Golgi body vs. &quot;cellular artifacts,&quot;  
<BR>
Prion vs. virus explanation for CJD/BSE (even with the Noble Prize already 
<BR>
given for Prions).
<BR>
<P><P>[1] Stephen Hawking said theories are not reality, only models predicting 
<BR>
observations (see the reference in my post to John K. Clark today).  
<BR>
According to Hawking, theories are not even explanations of reality and 
<BR>
certainly not &quot;true or false&quot;, just better or worse at prediction.
