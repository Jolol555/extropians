<EM>&gt; &gt; It occurred to me after I read Eliezer's enthusiastic response to

<EM>&gt; What?  I don't remember responding to anything of the sort.

<EM>&gt; Just kidding.

<P>Common decency compels me to confess at this point.  All those
<BR>
dinosaur.die.die posts on the usenet from ~ 1990 were not written
<BR>
by Eliezer at all.  I wrote them all and signed them with his name
<BR>
as a little gag.  That innocent young man had never even *heard*
<BR>
of heavy metal bands or acid rock at that stage of his life.
<BR>
Thru a little neurohacking experiment gone awry, I managed to
<BR>
convince him that he had in fact posted the silliness.
<BR>
<P>And by the way, all those posts under my name regarding choosing
<BR>
Mars colonists based on their size: Eliezer wrote those.  Just thought
<BR>
I would clear up that little misunderstanding.  spike
<BR>
<P>{8^D
<BR>
<P>not.
