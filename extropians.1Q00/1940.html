<EM>&gt; More is currently assisting us in the development of what will be the

<EM>&gt; leading business strategy hub on the Internet,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Wow!  I hear people say the people in this list are talkers and not doers in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the classic silicon valley success story way but this proves them wrong!  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huzzah to Max for being part of such an impressive project!  I hope he will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get stock options if he hasn't already.  I'm sure being rich would help 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; further his extropian goals! :)

<P>Hollow laughter ...
<BR>
<P>Congrats to Max -- and good luck coping with the bad food, long hours
<BR>
spent at the desk, gut-gnawing anxiety, unreliable pay-cheques, sudden-
<BR>
death panics over how to manage exponential growth, and all the other
<BR>
fun that comes from working for a start-up _before_ you get to the stage
<BR>
of IPO's and stock options!
<BR>
<P>I'm now working for the third start-up I've been employed by. Start-ups
<BR>
are burn-out city: I'm 35 and I don't think I've got the energy to go
<BR>
through this sort of experience again, at least without some serious smart
<BR>
drugs. It's the first I've been in that's actually made it to market;
<BR>
we should be going public in the UK next month, and unless the guys with
<BR>
the money are lying to us, we should have stock options enough to make
<BR>
it worth the pain.  Despite the WIRED hagiography, start-ups aren't an
<BR>
automatic ticket to having a fun time in the office and getting rich
<BR>
in the process: they can be a fast-track road to Not Having A Life,
<BR>
fucking yourself over, and generally rendering yourself miserable and
<BR>
penniless when they collapse under you.
<BR>
<P>Max is a big boy -- I've seen him on this list since, um, 1991 or 1992 --
<BR>
so I figure he probably knows what he's getting into.
<BR>
<P>Good luck. You're going to need it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who, twenty-nine months after joining DataCash as contractor #1, three
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks before the company was registered, is now looking back in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bafflement and wondering how two programmer dudes in an office in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh and one slick-willie money man in a shared office in London
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somehow turned into a corporation: and who is slightly rueful about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having insisted on coming in as a contractor for the first six months,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than an employee/shareholder, because he figured the probability
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of failure was about 80%.)
