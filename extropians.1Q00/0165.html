<EM>&gt;I-80, holding the Mona Lisa, with a caption saying &quot;here be art

<EM>&gt;that can stop the world&quot;, in the meantime, along comes Mick's truck,

<EM>&gt;he's squinting, trying to read the caption, oooopppps, too late...

<P>Thanks for making me your point's poster grrrl, and I loved Robin's
<BR>
response, but if I was to billboard the arts on a fast track, I'd do more
<BR>
of a master-minded display of arts and sciences coalescing in a future body
<BR>
design with brilliantly enhanced senses that glisten across the steely road
<BR>
with neon fission bursting particles like refracted sounds and lights
<BR>
bending time and stilling time, if only for a moment, and then giving each
<BR>
passer-by an extended sensorial moment to pay ATTENTION (rather than a toll
<BR>
fee) to my art which is the accumulation of all arts but placed carefully
<BR>
and inspiring in the moment.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the oooooppps would be refracted around to and come out as a
<BR>
deflecting sppppoooo which, to my own ears, has a more melliferous resonation.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Sooner or later people will come to treat physical reality the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same way they do data files -- if it isn't of any use now, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might as well compress it and put it on a backup tape.
</EM><BR>
<P>I spent probably most of my mental time in the future -- a LONG way into
<BR>
the future but that doesn't stop me from enjoying each moment (why would I
<BR>
want to stop the world, I rather like the spinning) -
<BR>
<P>sppppoooo ... oh, there you went so fast that I didn't even get a chance to
<BR>
backup.
