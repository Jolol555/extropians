'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&lt;sigh&gt;  YES.  REALLY.  Take my word for it for chrissake.  :)  A list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enemies will not suffice: you have to figure out how to write down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;function that takes grids of numbers and spits out a 1 if it's a picture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of one of the enemies on your list and a 0 otherwise.  This is a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;complicated function which nobody can write down today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Using AIs here is the application of a magic genie that will solve all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your computational problems.  A genie like that might not WANT to solve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all our problems; it might just decide to do its own thing or figure out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the meaning of life or what have you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tell me it is *impossible* and I will shut up.  The mere fact that its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not easy does not make a hill of beans difference to me.  It wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *easy* going to the moon. If it can be done, at some point or another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somebody will throw enough money and enough programmers at the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get it done.  The fact that nobody has done it yet, or that *you*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't see a way to do it does not matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I don't think it's impossible.  I think it's hard.  Which means
<BR>
that it's easier for the more powerful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But even a hugely massive problem becomes manageable when tasks are broken 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up and distributed.  The bigger the problem, the more hardware and software 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you throw at it.  If you have every machine on the planet working to break 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it there is no such thing yet as an unbreakable code.  You have to admit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that at *some* level of computational power the problem can be solved.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think you'll also have to admit that at some point in the future that level 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of computation will be reached.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  And it will be more accessible to the powerful than the weak.
