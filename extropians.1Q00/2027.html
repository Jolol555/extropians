<EM>&gt; &gt; Um, a 50% efficiency figure for LEDs sounds a bit on the high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side. I'm  confident that the efficiency is high. Last I heard, the
</EM><BR>
white 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; light ones are about to push the efficiency of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fluorescents/gas-discharge, somewhere around 18%(?), which is pretty
</EM><BR>
darned cool. Ultraefficient red  LEDs might be quite a bit higher, like
<BR>
30-35%. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Lamps, including LEDs, are normally not rated in terms of efficiency
<BR>
(watts of light per watt of electrical power input) because human
<BR>
perception of light varies with the spectral character of the light. 
<BR>
Instead, LEDs are usually rated in millicandelas of luminous intensity at
<BR>
the angle of peak intensity, at some recommended operating current.  And
<BR>
lamps in general, including LEDs, are rated in luminous efficacy, which
<BR>
is in units of lumens per watt, at some recommended operating current,
<BR>
voltage, or power.
<BR>
<P><P>A standard (non-halogen) 100 watt 120 volt incandescent bulb has a
<BR>
luminous efficacy of 17.5 lumens per watt when operated at the
<BR>
recommended voltage.  The figure for an LED could be lower or higher than
<BR>
that, depending on the specs of the LED.  It varies a lot.  Some LEDs put
<BR>
out 10 or 20, or more, times as much light per unit of input power as
<BR>
other LEDs.  The luminous efficacy of an incandescent lamp or an LED can
<BR>
be pushed higher by operating the lamp at a higher input power than the
<BR>
recommended level, but that reduces the life expectancy.  In practice,
<BR>
LEDs are operated from a current regulator circuit, and the power
<BR>
consumption of that circuit affects the net luminous efficacy of the
<BR>
overall lighting system.  The current regulator is usually just a
<BR>
resistor, but that resistor can waste a lot of power.  Incandescent lamps
<BR>
operate directly from a constant-voltage power source and do not require
<BR>
a current regulator circuit, as they are self-regulating.
<BR>
<P><P>To calculate the efficiency of a lamp from the luminous efficacy, one
<BR>
needs to apply a conversion factor for the physical power equivalent of
<BR>
light.  That is 1.61 milliwatts per lumen at 555 nanometers wavelength
<BR>
(green), which is the wavelength of the peak photoptic response of the
<BR>
human eye.  At other visible wavelengths the conversion factor is higher
<BR>
(more milliwatts per lumen).  So the maximum possible luminous efficacy
<BR>
is 621 lumens per watt, and that would only be possible at a wavelength
<BR>
of 555 nm.
<BR>
<P><P>Using the 1.61 milliwatts per lumen factor, and an efficacy of 17.5
<BR>
lumens per watt, the nominal efficiency of a 100 watt incandescent bulb
<BR>
would be 2.8%, but that would be technically correct only if the bulb
<BR>
emits all of its light at about 555 nm.  Since the bulb actually puts out
<BR>
a yellowish white light, the actual efficiency, based on the physical
<BR>
power equivalent of the light, is higher, probably somewhere in the range
<BR>
5% to 8%.  Specific information about the spectral content of the light
<BR>
would be needed to calculate an exact efficiency figure.  But an
<BR>
efficiency figure can be a misleading expression of the performance of a
<BR>
lamp, since the perception of light varies according to the spectral
<BR>
content of the light.  Comparing the efficiency of a red LED with the
<BR>
efficiency of a soft-white fluorescent tube is like equating apples and
<BR>
oranges, because of the color difference between the LED and the
<BR>
fluorescent lamp, and its effect on the perception of light.  Luminous
<BR>
efficacy is a better practical standard of comparison than efficiency.

<EM>&gt; I dunno about efficeincy numbers but FYI LED's are replacing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incadesants on trucks.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My 48 ft RGN has all LED lites.  They supposedly last almost forever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and use a fraction of the power to produce more light.  Very Bright
</EM><BR>
tail 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lites..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is they cost (a LOT) more.  But the price is going down.
