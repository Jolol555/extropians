<BR>
<EM>&gt; These open debates on this list may *seem* not to lead directly to many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate and tangible results, but I think that view disregards the many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very useful and fruitful cooperations and ideas that people subscribed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this mailing list *are* gaining from this list -- and about which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who are individually benefiting and who (after some listening in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and contributing to discussions on this list) just quietly go do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps send back (?too) little feed-back.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I did not mean to imply that all of our discussions are pointless.
<BR>
I was trying to focus on the specific mode where we &quot;debate&quot;, although
<BR>
perhaps a better term would be &quot;argue&quot; or even &quot;fight&quot;.  The classic bad
<BR>
example would be the gun control topic which took up so much time and
<BR>
energy a few months ago.  Both sides in that debate were convinced that
<BR>
they were good and the other side was evil, and no amount of energy was
<BR>
spared in an offer-no-quarter battle.
<BR>
<P>In a memetic conflict like this, the disputed ground lies in the minds
<BR>
of the audience (normally there is no real expectation of convincing the
<BR>
opponent).  Both sets of memes are competing to advance their share of the
<BR>
this memetic landscape.  They are trying to overcome the rival, to move
<BR>
the battle front one way or the other, to take over more memetic ground.
<BR>
<P>No doubt one side or the other did gain some ground in the memetic war
<BR>
of the guns debate.  But both sides come away determined to fight even
<BR>
harder next time, to consolidate their gains or retake lost territory.
<BR>
It is very questionable whether the gains are worth all the destruction
<BR>
and costs imposed by warfare, even memetic warfare.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     (For example, the Dutch &gt;H organization &quot;Transcedo&quot;, perhaps the 2nd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oldest European &gt;H organization, was started about 4 or 5 years ago
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by 4 people who met each other on *this* mailing list; in its turn,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this local Dutch group 2.5 years ago organized the first European &gt;H
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gathering which has now snowballed into a solid annual event (called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;TransVision&quot;) with a significant momentum of its own, and which in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its turn again is I think amazingly (and unexpectedly) much helping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transhumanism and Extropianism in Europe getting organized.  The local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dutch group is enjoying growing attention from national media; and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enjoying a steadily increasing influx of new local people interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Transhumanism; all of this will help strengthen the &gt;H 'movement'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and will give it more man- and brain-power.  If it were not for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions on this mailing list and the things inspired by them, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think Transhumanism in Europe might still be nearly non-existent.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's great that Transcedo has been so successful and influential.
<BR>
This is the kind of thing where we can be very successful, working and
<BR>
brainstorming to support each other's efforts.  It's a positive-sum
<BR>
game, where we expand the options and possibilities available to us.
<BR>
Debate tends to be zero-sum or even negative-sum.  I feel that we can
<BR>
best increase extropy by being supportive of each other rather than by
<BR>
looking for battles to fight.
