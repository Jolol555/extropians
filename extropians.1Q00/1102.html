<EM>&gt; &gt; The way this is phrased got [Robert Bradbury] to thinking --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Why do we have such a &quot;magical mystery cult&quot; about a collection of cells?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   [I'm probably going to get eaten alive for that statement -- bygones...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert I know you will endure a lotta crap for this, but I grok your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message.  Abortion is one of those hot button subjects, second only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to those devices which hurl small lead objects at high speeds.  But it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not not be.  Seems we should be able to dissociate the emotion from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abortion, if we wish.  Looks to me like we have now or will soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the technology to selectively block the action of any hormone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we should be able to figure out which of these causes us to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such strong emotional response to abortion.  Then block it.  Then
</EM><BR>
<P>I would hazard that those neurotransmitters that cause such an emotional
<BR>
reaction to abortion would be those that cause emotional reactions in
<BR>
general. Blocking them, or as I understand you, removing them from the
<BR>
equation of your mental make-up is tantamount to &quot;roboticizing&quot; your
<BR>
thought processes. This is something that on the surface seems to have
<BR>
tremendous merit, and indeed would be quite useful in specific
<BR>
situations, but I think at a deeper level is probably not the best
<BR>
course of action in this particular instance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; make the decision for parenthood based only on intellectual criteria,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaving emotion, religion, hormonal drives, etc. completely out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the question.
</EM><BR>
<P>But Spike, don't you see? It may be those very things that you want to
<BR>
factor out of the decision making process that should be given the most
<BR>
weight. A decision as weighty as whether or not to allow the growth of a
<BR>
potential human being should take into account all available
<BR>
information, including that which may not be considered to be
<BR>
&quot;rational&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;, &quot;theistic&quot;, or otherwise. Life isn't lived in a
<BR>
vacuum, and rather than try and create one in my mind, I think I would
<BR>
be better off through integration and understanding of my emotional,
<BR>
less rational heritage. Parceling those things out seems like only half
<BR>
a solution, imho.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then perhaps we would have a world in which *all* children that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are born are children that are *wanted*.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I applaud the sentiment. The reality, however, is that there will always
<BR>
be those who question the decision to bring (or not) another sentience
<BR>
into the world of existence and self-awareness. Given the kind of
<BR>
technologies we discuss, coupled with our current understanding of
<BR>
physics, it definitely seems to suggest that all matter has the
<BR>
*potential* to be sentient, at our level and beyond. What this indicates
<BR>
to me is that the scope of this problem (abortion) is so vast that we
<BR>
should try to take into account all thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and
<BR>
actions when attempting to decide as a society what the best course of
<BR>
travel into the future should be.
