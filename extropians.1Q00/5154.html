<EM>&gt; Sarah, if such a technology were to ever be instituted, at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a chance for justice? Perhaps a grande civil suit against those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'defendents'?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly so. Thinking about it, it seems likely that any resurrection would
<BR>
be carried out on a case-by-case basis by interested individuals, rather
<BR>
than through some global effort. That might mean that such people would not
<BR>
be 'reinstituted', although (1) doubtless some far-right group would love to
<BR>
see Hitler popping round for tea and biscuits and (2) no-one is sure who
<BR>
Jack-the-ripper was, so if s/he was resurrected, who'd call for justice
<BR>
against him/her?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, suppose one brought a civil suit against Hitler: he doesn't have any
<BR>
property, so what could one get on winning the case? In terms of a criminal
<BR>
prosecution, would there be any point in bringing someone back, simply to
<BR>
imprison them for life? (Assuming Hitler's guilt, which I'm totally at ease
<BR>
with doing.) I can't help but think that there are better things to spend
<BR>
our time doing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! A thought: at least those people given the death penalty and
<BR>
subsequently cleared could be brought back. Boy, would they be pissed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah
