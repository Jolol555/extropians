<P><EM>&gt; It's like Robert, out on the information highway, presenting us with an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example of art, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, point taken on my use of limited classic examples and on Robin's point
<BR>
that Natasha's art would stop trucks (so she should present it on a truck
<BR>
so you don't have the inertia matching problem causing accidents).
<BR>
<P>Thanks also for her reminding me that the point of the clock is to get
<BR>
people to think in long time horizons.  I've been doing this for so
<BR>
long that I forget that others don't have this perspective.  It seemed
<BR>
so obvious to me many years ago that if you were going to live hundreds
<BR>
of years you would be pro-environment and &quot;conservationist&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I do think perhaps that this observation may get lost from the
<BR>
press releases (though I will admit to not reading them closely).
<BR>
People will tend to lose sight of the point of the clock as soon
<BR>
as you mention living hundreds of years because you've immediately
<BR>
cast yourself as someone from la-la land.  Until you get people to
<BR>
accept that as a *probability*, not as a mere *possibility*, everything
<BR>
that falls out as a consequence is fictional speculation.
<BR>
<P>But, that being the case, it brings us back around to &quot;conservationism&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;greens&quot; &amp; &quot;politics&quot;.  If you assume that we are going to live hundreds
<BR>
of years then of course you are going to have a conservationist perspective.
<BR>
So being a transhumanist, would seem to *inherently* incorporate a
<BR>
pro-environment political orientation.  I personally can remember in my
<BR>
youth, fishing for cod and haddock in the ocean banks East of Boston.
<BR>
We also caught 600-800lb tunafish.  Today?  Nada.  The oceans have been
<BR>
stripped clean in a classic case of &quot;raping the commons&quot;.  This was
<BR>
entirely due to the politicians caving in to the short-sighted economic
<BR>
agenda of a special interest group (commercial fisherman), and even
<BR>
subsidizing the building of larger more efficient harvesting vessels.
<BR>
We are now dealing with similar problems in the Pacific Northwest
<BR>
regarding salmon fisheries.  Its a crime and the battles have not
<BR>
yet been won by the conservationists/resource &quot;managers&quot;.  Given
<BR>
the economic incentives involved, even if we do manage to develop
<BR>
oceanic wildlife &quot;preserves&quot;, it is going to take active government
<BR>
policing to see that they are not violated.  Fortunately we probably
<BR>
have the satellite technology to do this.  Though I could see
<BR>
requirements for un-tamperable GPS recording &quot;black boxes&quot; on
<BR>
fishing vessels.
<BR>
<P>Now, given Greg's work, one needs to be careful in splitting the hairs
<BR>
when it comes down to where we would oppose the agenda or actions of
<BR>
organizations like the Greens or Sierra Club.  It seems to me that at
<BR>
the root of some of these organizations is a desire to return the Earth
<BR>
to its &quot;natural&quot; state.  Since that would &quot;theoretically&quot; require
<BR>
eliminating all the humans, this would seem to be a very *anti-humanist*
<BR>
perspective.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone familiar with these movements know of any good sources on
<BR>
the &quot;philosophy&quot; of &quot;Greenism&quot;?  I.e., someone who has looked closely
<BR>
at how much &quot;greenism&quot; is &quot;enough&quot;?  How do they resolve the inherent
<BR>
paradoxes in nature?  E.g., it used to be that conservationists would
<BR>
try to put out fires, now it is realized that the &quot;natural&quot; thing to
<BR>
do is to let them burn.  How do they resolve the question that extinctions
<BR>
have occured &quot;naturally&quot; for billions of years?  How do they make
<BR>
a distinction between man and a volcano causing extinctions which in turn
<BR>
may create new niches, allowing for further evolution)?  It seems that
<BR>
in taking on the extremists, we should be very clear about what we
<BR>
do support in cases where we are aligned with the moderates.
