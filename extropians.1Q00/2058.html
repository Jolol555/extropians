<P>
FYI: Here's just one example of the kind of anti-genetic engineering stuff I 
<BR>
encounter in my monitoring of the Greens.  Note that these folks now clearly 
<BR>
link opposition to non-agricultural uses of genetic engineering into the same 
<BR>
movement that has already declared victory against &quot;GM crops&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Just for the record, I DID predict that European anti-GM sentiment would 
<BR>
result in trade tension and, ultimately, capitulation by US govenrment and 
<BR>
industry.  The momentum is all on their side right now; opposition to Green 
<BR>
genetic luddism is poorly organized and not energized by the kind of 
<BR>
widely-accepted, unifying ideological underpinnings enjoyed by the Greens.
