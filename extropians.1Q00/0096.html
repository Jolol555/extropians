<P>I would have to add to Natasha comments the opportunist marketeers.  I haven't
<BR>
been in Europe for a year or so, and was fairly stunned while flying
<BR>
through Zurich on Swiss Air at the subtle &quot;Green&quot; emphasis on &quot;Natural&quot;
<BR>
products on both the in-flight video (you had to go through a screen
<BR>
that said nothing but &quot;Natural&quot; to get to the movies) as well as the
<BR>
butter on your meal trays screaming &quot;Natural&quot;.  When I asked the flight
<BR>
attendent about this, they had no answer as to why this was being presented
<BR>
so blatantly.
<BR>
<P>I can only suspect that the V.P. of Marketing at Swiss Air has a brother
<BR>
who is a farmer getting his markets cut out from under him via growth
<BR>
hormone enhanced cow products.  (One would presume the Swiss landscape
<BR>
makes it more marginal and more likely to suffer from competition
<BR>
in agricultural products.)
<BR>
<P>Now, of course this presents an interesting opportunity.  A directed
<BR>
campaign at Swiss Air, asking them if they would prefer to fly planes
<BR>
powered by the &quot;incantations of wizards&quot; could point out how on the
<BR>
one hand they embrace technology, yet on the other hand they are trying
<BR>
to deny it.  It would probably only take letters from 3-4 of us
<BR>
(particularly if we bought some stock and wrote as stockholders)
<BR>
to get the thing up to corporate &quot;significance&quot; level (if we got some
<BR>
press as pro-progress folks take on luddites, it would be even better).
<BR>
<P>When you are dealing with individuals making &quot;food&quot; choices it is one
<BR>
thing.  When you are dealing with a food supplier making choices that
<BR>
force a more expensive choice upon you, then you have a very interesting
<BR>
case, particularly when the supplier inherently and obviously must rely
<BR>
on scientific technology for their business.  Why can't I select the
<BR>
&quot;un-natural&quot; meal choice and get a discount on my ticket?
<BR>
<P>Even if you can't move Swiss Air directly, you can do it indirectly
<BR>
through Delta becase of their Code-Share agreements.  The U.S. pro-tech
<BR>
culture can directly confront the European luddites.  (Which isn't to
<BR>
say that all Europeans are that way, its just a bias thats been setup
<BR>
by the press, primarily due to the Mad Cow disease handling).
<BR>
<P>Food for the mental grist-mill.
