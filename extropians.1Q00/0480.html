<P>Ja me too.  {8^D  However, as I said, I have to my own satisfaction
<BR>
determined that the notion of a universal power casting into the lake
<BR>
of fire those who fail to believe, is one that evolved in order for
<BR>
the powerful to control the proletariate.
<BR>
<P>I was once a fundamentalist believer, but in college I happened to sit
<BR>
in on a physics colloquium where Carl Sagan's Cosmos, which led me
<BR>
to Steven J. Gould's Ever Since Darwin, which led me to Darwin
<BR>
himself.  I was amazed at how thought provoking a 130 year old
<BR>
book could be: Darwin's Origin of Species and the Descent of Man
<BR>
are two books that revolutionized my view of everything.
<BR>
<P>Today I am a formally trained Old Testament scholar and atheist
<BR>
without the slightest cogitive dissonance or doubt regarding my
<BR>
convictions.  How I wish I had discovered Darwin at age 11
<BR>
instead of 22.  I would have saved myself much time during the
<BR>
critical formative years.  Good luck to you, John, in your own
<BR>
search for truth.  {8-]  spike
