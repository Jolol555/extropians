</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; property rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is one thing to hold the opinion that infinitely copiable memespace
</EM><BR>
<P>Assumption check: Who says memespace is infinte? In a finite universe, there is
<BR>
a limited amount of memespace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; should be fenced off and privately held the same way as uncopyable
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; dirtspace, but it is quite another to continue claiming that those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oppose the former also oppose the latter when you know that's not true.
</EM><BR>
<P>memescapes and landscapes are equal to me. I am equally comfortable living in
<BR>
the land of ideas as I am living in concrete reality. This is one reason why
<BR>
even extropians have let the socialist statists at ICANN steal the whole kit and
<BR>
kaboodle out from under us. Since eventually that is where most of us will be
<BR>
living one day, failing to see memespace as real estate is a serious
<BR>
miscalculation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Either you can't see the obvious fundamental objective difference, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are spreading a malicious lie; in either case, further rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument with you on the issue is impossible until you admit that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement is false, and that &quot;property&quot; and &quot;intellectual property&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are two completely separate things, unfortunate linguistic and legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similarities notwithstanding.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are not separate things, if you accept the view that the mind is merely a
<BR>
program. Your right of existence and self ownership is bound up in your right to
<BR>
ownership of your own self program. Having legal structures that ensure that the
<BR>
product of that software mechanism are properly paid for is an essential part of
<BR>
your self ownership rights. If such structures are not in place, then for all
<BR>
intents and purposes you are the slave of whoever feels like using your ideas in
<BR>
violation of your contract with them individually, or with the social entity to
<BR>
which you all belong.
