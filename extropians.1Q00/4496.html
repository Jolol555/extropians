<P>It depends.
<BR>
<P>If your parents were British citizens I believe you've got a legal claim
<BR>
on UK citizenship. Otherwise, you're a foreign immigrant, and since
<BR>
1970 successive governments have tightened up on immigration into the UK
<BR>
to the point where it's probably fair to say that's it's harder to get
<BR>
into the UK than the USA -- unless you're an EU resident. So the
<BR>
easy option is probably to locate a friendly and easy-to-cope-with EU
<BR>
government, get residence on their soil, then move. Ireland, maybe?
