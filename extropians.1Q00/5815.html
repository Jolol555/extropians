</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There's also the question of whether the indiginous population would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; welcome the reinstatement of imperialist external rule.  Most of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; countries worked hard to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Economically many countries are worse off, but it would be a terrible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blow to their pride to ask for the hated rulers to come back in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; start running things again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you have an apartment house that you aren't managing well, you can hire 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;management company to do it for you.  There are cities that contract out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ambulance services, garbage collection, and even fire fighting services, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;order to save money.  Why not contract out the entire government to a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporation who could manage the country professionally?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If this idea caught on, then corporations would have to compete against 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other to win bids.  If countries adopted this idea, government would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reduced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the boring task of keeping the streets clean, and making the trains run 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There are historical precedents - the famed East India Corporation, for one 
<BR>
very large scale and enduring example.  They didn't do particularly worse 
<BR>
than the natives in many or most cases, I suspect, but they did function as 
<BR>
an arm of British Imperialism.  When all else failed, you called in the 
<BR>
navy.  There is another case worthy of note, however.
<BR>
<P>In the New Hebrides, for about one-hundred years there was joint rule 
<BR>
divided between the British, French and natives.  If you had a legal issue, 
<BR>
you could pick which court you wanted it tried in.  If opposing parties 
<BR>
chose a different one, then there were procedures to handle joint 
<BR>
proceedings.  Such arrangements are also standard within the arbitration 
<BR>
community.  What I'm suggesting is that it may not be necessary for ONE 
<BR>
corporation/trust/co-op/Mondragon-style organization to centralize all 
<BR>
decision-making power.  A devolution to decentralized competition, so long 
<BR>
as a basic framework of rules is followed, may be more effecient and less 
<BR>
productive of special-interest problems.
<BR>
<P>My own solution - just to put it out there again - is to first go for a 
<BR>
universal contract.
