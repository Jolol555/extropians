<P>
Extropians,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with John Grigg who said it was a good movie but
<BR>
nothing like 2001 which was very similar.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't much really care for &quot;style&quot; or whatever so much
<BR>
as I do real content and real meaning in a story.  And basically, all
<BR>
the story lines on every ET movie to date, including Star Trek, ET,
<BR>
2001, Contact, Mission to Mars, and all the rest (including all
<BR>
religious ideas about some powerful God out there hiding from us..)
<BR>
are so absurd and ridiculous when you think about them.  Are you
<BR>
listening ETs!!!???  Gods!!!???? screw your &quot;prime directive&quot;, or any
<BR>
other &quot;theodicy&quot; or excuse you can come up with for hiding and not
<BR>
helping.  Please get down hear and do whatever you can to help me save
<BR>
my parents and everything else who is about to die.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess, as long as there is something dieing about every
<BR>
second or so on this planet, I won't be satisfied with an ET movie
<BR>
until the ETs in the story come rushing in with their hospital ships,
<BR>
emergency rescue vehicles, sirens a blazing and lights a
<BR>
flashing... or whatever, and do all they can to help save those people
<BR>
from dieing before anything else.  What's all this crap about: &quot;What
<BR>
would you ask a more intelligent alien?&quot;  The answer, it seems to me,
<BR>
should be obvious.  The question should be: &quot;How can I save my grand
<BR>
parents...  and everything else that is about to die down here before
<BR>
it is to late!?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;spoiler&gt;
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
...
<BR>
...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems so absurd to think that some supper aliens would have
<BR>
some impersonal head sculpture, (with a single alien that remained
<BR>
behind hidden in it?)  that would kill humans if they failed some kind
<BR>
of test...  or accidently kill someone if he was next to the monolith
<BR>
when something came through it as in 2001/2010...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a supper alien has helped me save my friends, family,
<BR>
pets... from dieing, then I might wonder what I would ask next.  How
<BR>
smart does an ET have to be before he knows that that is the one and
<BR>
only most fundamental and important of all question or issue that must
<BR>
be dealt with first before anything else?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a movie or story or religion gets at least remotely
<BR>
close to such a plain, simple, and fundamentally obvious truth, I'll
<BR>
be very disappointed with any ET story or depiction of some supposed
<BR>
powerful God in some religion or whatever.  How can we, as a society,
<BR>
be so completely blind and ignorant in all of our Sci-Fi fantasies and
<BR>
our religions to what seems to me to be so blatantly obvious?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
