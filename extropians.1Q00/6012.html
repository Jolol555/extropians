<EM>&gt; `Sox18,' they said two years ago, `is an endothelian-specific gene which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably involved in transcriptional control of endothelium-specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genes.' Tonight's news report sez it's the (or a) key gene controlling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; angiogenesis. Switch it on locally, and you'd get fast growth of blood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supply where you need it. Switch it off with statins or other antagonists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you stop tumor vascularisation cold. Or so I surmise.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there's going to be a backlash against some of the over-promising
<BR>
of the value of the human genome project and other gene sequencing efforts.
<BR>
Just knowing a gene's sequence does not automatically give you the ability
<BR>
to control its activities.
<BR>
<P>In the first place, since the protein folding problem is not understood,
<BR>
the gene's sequence gives only a very rough idea of the shape of the
<BR>
protein it codes for.  And similarly it tells very little about the shape
<BR>
of the other molecules and molecular clusters that it has to interact
<BR>
with to do its work.  You probably don't have enough information to allow
<BR>
you to synthesize a drug that will mimic the shape of the protein well
<BR>
enough to block or promote its efforts.  You have some hints, but there
<BR>
is much experimental work needed.
<BR>
<P>Also, the whole question of gene regulation goes beyond knowing just the
<BR>
sequence that codes for the gene.  What turns it on, what turns it off,
<BR>
is a complicated interaction of many genes.  It will take a long time
<BR>
even once the HG is in hand to untangle the web of interactions dealing
<BR>
with any particular function in the cell.  (Of course much of this work
<BR>
is ongoing and doesn't depend on knowing the sequences.)
<BR>
<P>And then even when we have the ability to control the gene or to
<BR>
synthesize a duplicate, we still face the questions of clinical delivery,
<BR>
side effects of the drug, and beneficial or harmful effects elsewhere
<BR>
in the body of the gene that we may be promoting or blocking.
<BR>
<P>In short it's a long road starting from the gene sequence to the point
<BR>
where you have a clinically effective treatment for a related disorder.
<BR>
Yes, knowing the genetic sequence is of tremendous value in making the
<BR>
research more effective, but it's not a magic wand that will lead to
<BR>
instant cures flowing from the lab.  As the HGP completes I think we
<BR>
will start to see a major PR effort to tone down the expectations of
<BR>
prompt miracle cures.
