[dead horse; baby seal; qualia... they all look the same to me...]

<P>[skye wrote:]
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, but what that would mean then is that by so
</EM><BR>
computing you would disprove them by saying that the
<BR>
things which people define them by are false.  If you
<BR>
say that something called a &quot;fizzle&quot; had four legs and
<BR>
I see something you call a fizzle that does not have
<BR>
four legs, either your definition is wrong or your
<BR>
identification of the fizzle is wrong.  If it don't
<BR>
talk like a duck and it don't walk like a duck, then
<BR>
it is a non-duck object.  Therefore....
<BR>
if we've computed qualia....
<BR>
they aren't.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ja, i understand that. in hindsight, i think it was poorly worded, but
<BR>
what i was getting at is that it seems that something much like an aspect
<BR>
of qualia is computable. pedantic? quite possibly. 
<BR>
<P>[and dan wrote:]
<BR>
<EM>&gt;So on what grounds should we accept a qualia axiom?  On what grounds
</EM><BR>
should we reject it?  Can any account of qualia be given which does not
<BR>
beg the question against a qualia skeptic?  The skepticism alone has not
<BR>
convinced the believers, and the axiom, naturally, hasn't convinced very
<BR>
many non-believers.  How can debate move forward from this point?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yea, i hear ya. it does kinda seem to be at a deadlock. well, lets see
<BR>
here... does the term &quot;awake&quot; describe anything? have you ever had
<BR>
insommnia? if so, was there not something fucked up about that? if so,
<BR>
what, exactly? did you answer this already and did i forget? is that a
<BR>
meaningless question? har... i see how this can get old. dan, if your
<BR>
really sick of it, thats cool with me. i can quit any time. honest. no, i
<BR>
mean it. [twitch]
