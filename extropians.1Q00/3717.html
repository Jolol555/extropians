<P>
Friends,
<BR>
<P>Following up on Robert's &quot;The Tsiolkovski Tower Re-examined&quot; post, there's
<BR>
a little related idea I wanted to run by you guys.
<BR>
<P>In the August (I think) 1965 issue of Scientific American there was an
<BR>
article on &quot;trains&quot; running in evacuated tubes inside of underground
<BR>
tunnels.  I loved the idea 35 years ago, and I've thought about it often
<BR>
since then.  What appealed to me was the elegance and efficiency.  A
<BR>
cylindrical train car, like a piston in a cylinder, leaves the station with
<BR>
a boost of atmospheric pressure behind it (airlocks close behind it
<BR>
sequentially to keep the air from filling a significant length of the tube.
<BR>
&nbsp;The air between airlock doors and station exit doors is then pumped out.)
<BR>
Then the  train accelerates downhill by gravity and some form af additional
<BR>
propulsion, perhaps linear induction (electrical), until it reaches its
<BR>
cruising depth and speed.  Then it glides along to its next stop where it
<BR>
is decelerated by a similar process in reverse.  To whatever extent you can
<BR>
minimize the train-to-tube friction--by maglev, for example--you get a free
<BR>
ride.  It's very much like a spacecraft in orbit, and, in fact, at orbital
<BR>
velocity, it actually is in orbit, the passengers are weightless and the
<BR>
train car does not push down of the bottom of the tube.  Over the years of
<BR>
playing with this I discovered that at escape velocity--about 25K mph--the
<BR>
centripital force would be exactly one gee directed upward against the top
<BR>
of the tube.  This means that as the train accelerates from zero to 17.5K
<BR>
mph (orbital velocity) and then from there to 25K mph, a passenger in the
<BR>
train would experience a gradual lessening of the downward force of gravity
<BR>
until it reached zero at 17.5 K mph, then, if the train rotated 180 degrees
<BR>
in the tube and continued to accelerate, the passenger would experience a
<BR>
gradual increase on the &quot;downward&quot; force, until at  25K mph, he would be
<BR>
sitting with his or her butt pressed into the seat just like any present
<BR>
day train passenger.  (This example is simplified for explanatory purposes,
<BR>
and is only accurate for a tube circling the planet at the equator.
<BR>
Elsewhere there are side thrust forces due to coriolis effects and due to
<BR>
tube curvature in any turns.) 
<BR>
<P>Now, I thought to myself, as a result of seeing the train as being &quot;in
<BR>
orbit&quot;, that you could actually use this as a launch method if you could
<BR>
get the end of the tube--or, in train parlance, the end of a &quot;spur&quot; of the
<BR>
&quot;line&quot; up above the atmosphere. (You could have an airlock-type closure on
<BR>
the end of the tube, so that you didn't really have to go all the way up
<BR>
the &quot;hard&quot; vacuum.  You could open the airlock briefly so the space train
<BR>
could exit and then afterwards close the airlock door behind it.)
<BR>
Depending on certain small details, such as how precisely tangentially you
<BR>
exit the tube, you may have to adjust your orbit a bit with ye olde
<BR>
conventional thrusters to avoid plunging back into the atmosphere half an
<BR>
orbit later.  Compared to the launch energy however, this adjustment is
<BR>
very, very small.
<BR>
<P>Okay.  So now, how to get the tube up there, some hundred miles or so.
<BR>
Here's where things get fun.  I started out with the old &quot;mountainside
<BR>
ramp&quot; idea, trying to take advantage of mother nature and Mount Everest for
<BR>
the first six miles.  But clearly those first six miles are nothing
<BR>
compared to the last ninety-four,  so I abandoned that idea right away.
<BR>
Then, using a seven to one incline, I imagined a kind of roller-coaster
<BR>
dorsal-ridge truss-structure ramp, the end of which would be a hundred
<BR>
miles up, the base at the end two hundred miles wide, and the dorsal ridge
<BR>
707 miles long (base 700, height 100, hypotenuse 707).  (This is the
<BR>
closest I come to a comparison with the Tsiolkovski Tower.)  It was at this
<BR>
point that I had my little Eureka moment.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Throw away all of that massive truss structure.  Throw it ALL away.
<BR>
Dispose entirely of the idea of a compression loaded structure.  Support
<BR>
the launch tube entirely in tension, and not sky hook from above, but
<BR>
rather sky hook from below.  Picture a  seven hundred mile long conical
<BR>
balloon with a hemispherical base of radius one hundred miles.  Slice it in
<BR>
half axially, and lay it down on its cut side in the mid-Pacific.  With the
<BR>
cut edges anchored, and the balloon inflated, and the tube attached to the
<BR>
dorsal ridge, you have your launch ramp. And with airlocks to allow access
<BR>
to the interior of the ballon, you would have very little ocean surface
<BR>
area obstructed.
<BR>
<P>(Places Nobel prize back on mantlepiece, draws blinds and dances little
<BR>
dance of self-adulation, as dog, lying before fire, looks on wondering,
<BR>
&quot;What's gotten into him?&quot;)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
