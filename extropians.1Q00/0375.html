<EM>&gt;Where are the genuine ACTIVISTS in this population --not &gt;polemicists, not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opportunists, not wannabes, but individuals who &gt;really want to accomplish 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something other than rhetorical victories?
</EM><BR>
Welcome to the Extropian Digest list!! :)
<BR>
Seriously, I am isolated here in Alaska but based on what I read my 
<BR>
impression is things are getting done but by a relative few.  Isn't that how 
<BR>
things usually work everywhere?!  I see the Extro's carried out with top 
<BR>
scientists coming from all over to speak, Max and Natasha making many 
<BR>
appearances in the mass media, books being written, an Extropy Institute 
<BR>
website that as time goes by is improved and updated and probably many other 
<BR>
things too.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I think the digest fosters a sense of community and develops 
<BR>
friendships so is carrying out a very vital function.  I can see though 
<BR>
where you would want grow frustrated with things, so please tell us how 
<BR>
things are done in your organization to accomplish goals.
<BR>
<P>Talk is easier then action.  Also many people on the list are probably so 
<BR>
involved just trying to make a living they are limited in trying to do more 
<BR>
in their lives.  Eliezer has his vision of the singularity institute but the 
<BR>
money is not yet there and may never be to the extent he needs.
<BR>
<P>I admit I have seen Max's requests for donations to cover debts and to have 
<BR>
programmers help him out.  My understanding is he runs things on a very 
<BR>
small budget and out of his home.  I bet he would love to devote his full 
<BR>
energies to developing the Extropy Institute if time and funding allowed but 
<BR>
at least being a professor of philosophy is a pretty cool day job.
<BR>
<P>In the cryonics world there is much the same frustration in terms of a lack 
<BR>
of support in the financial area.  As is often said in Cryonet, there is no 
<BR>
need to go to outsiders for funding because in our own camp there is more 
<BR>
then enough money to go for our goals if people would only contribute 
<BR>
generously.  I read sadly the posts of Paul Wakfer on this list in '96 when 
<BR>
he spoke of the need of support for the reversible cryonics suspension 
<BR>
project he created called the Prometheus Project.
<BR>
<P>With one generous and very rich multi-millionaire donor the Extropian 
<BR>
Institute could have the kind of infrastructure the &quot;big&quot; think tanks have.  
<BR>
Max, Greg, Natasha and the other officers could have a field day I bet with 
<BR>
a twenty million dollar donation but it may be a long way in coming.  But 
<BR>
they have done so much really with very little.

<EM>&gt;Finally, I want you to believe that however assertively I may &gt;present my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current views on directions, approaches, tactics and &gt;strategies, I am in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every case most willing to compromise, or &gt;relinquish, as necessary for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;success of our endeavor. I would &gt;much rather cooperate with a planI am not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;optimistic about than do &gt;nothing. I feel, as you can sense, disturbed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about what I see as a &gt;tendency of this group to lose focus on action* and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather dissipate &gt;themselves ininterminable debate, frivolous projects, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind-games or &gt;pleasur-able but irrelevant chat that costs them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing.This means &gt;that I'm seeking a tough-minded group that will be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known publicly, &gt;not as people who desire to live forever,but as dedicated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idealists &gt;who fully intend to do precisely that- --despite mindless 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;opposition, ridicule, personal risk and daunting trials.Sincerely,Bob
</EM><BR>
<P>That you would say this really impacted me.  I hope your intelligence and 
<BR>
desire is put to good use.  You are looking for your own extropian dirty 
<BR>
dozen to get the job done.  I look forward to seeing how things develop.
<BR>
