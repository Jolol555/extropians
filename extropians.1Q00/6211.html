<P>I think Spike here is wrong.  Yes, ubiquitous surveillance under the current
<BR>
legal system would lead to a huge amount of new arrests and convictions for
<BR>
victimless crimes.  This might flood the court and prison system.  But what
<BR>
will change?  The current US court and prison system is flooded and the
<BR>
public response seems to be: make the laws tougher, hire more cops, and
<BR>
build more prisons.
<BR>
<P>There is no way to guarantee ubiquitous surveillance will bring about a
<BR>
fundamental change.  Even if the system of victimless crime laws must
<BR>
collapse under its own absurdity because ubiquitous surveillance there's no
<BR>
way to prevent lots of people from being harmed in the interim.
<BR>
<P>Nor is there any guarantee that a regime of ubiquitous surveillance will be
<BR>
permanent anyway.  It might be along the lines of one person, one vote, one
<BR>
election, one dictator.  The steps might be:
<BR>
<P>1.    adopt ubiquitous surveillance,
<BR>
2.    lots of crazy laws are enforced,
<BR>
3.    millions are jailed as they are convicted of breaking these laws,
<BR>
4.    someone rises up who undo the harm of the system,
<BR>
5.    ubiquitous surveillance is outlawed, but the government, a few
<BR>
powerful people, and small groups keep using the technology illegally and
<BR>
benefitting from it at a great disadvantage to everyone else.
<BR>
<P>It's sort of like saying we should outlaw locks on doors because I'll be
<BR>
able to steal back anything someone else steals from me.  In a nice small
<BR>
village, this might even work, but for 99% of the Earth's population, it
<BR>
would only encourage stealing.
