&nbsp;but why not find a way of changing our emotional state into that &quot;noble&quot;

&nbsp;state - of humility and resignation or whatever - directly, rather than go

&nbsp;through the inefficient and horrendous process of getting to that state 
<BR>
&nbsp;through having long series of painful experiences. That would be lot more

<P>Robin. First of all: we are assuming that one  a &quot;results&quot; oriented person 
<BR>
vs. a &quot;process&quot; oriented one. The road vs. the goal, etc. Many of us would 
<BR>
not want to give up our life paths, even if they were painful.
<BR>
<P>Also, If such a thing were possible, perhaps by implanting memories or just 
<BR>
rerouting, it would lose it's value IMO.  What was viewed once as &quot;noble&quot; or 
<BR>
&quot;calm&quot; would be closer to &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;unmovable&quot;.  Even more to the point, 
<BR>
there is the removal of goal of nobility and wisdom to get us THROUGH pain, 
<BR>
which would make us  horrifically unprepared should any real pain occur. 
<BR>
Lastly there is the spiritual growth which occurs, which tunes the body and 
<BR>
mind to &quot;being&quot; what one is. 
<BR>
You would not recieve the results you expected, I bet.

<P>&lt;&lt; You could choose the wrong one's?  A person might decide early 
<BR>
&nbsp;on that ambition and status are key and create a driving and relentless 
<BR>
&nbsp;personality.  They might never or too late realize how at least for them 
<BR>
&nbsp;this was a mistake.  I would still take the chance for myself but try to be 
<BR>
&nbsp;balanced in my approach.

<P>And here is a good point. If we can &quot;choose&quot; our wisdom when we are too young 
<BR>
to know what it is (before our pain causes growth) would we be equipped to 
<BR>
choose the correct &quot;nobility&quot;  that fits our life?  Or do we get it 
<BR>
pre-scribed by a neuro-shrink, or some kindly AI? Our parents? We then are 
<BR>
into an area I find highly disturbing.
