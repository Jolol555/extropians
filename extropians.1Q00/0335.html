<EM> &gt;That person would not accept your view that the universe is changing -
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the underlying essence for example might be eternal and unchanging and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the apparent change an illusion. A philosophical view a great deal of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;people have taken, however much we might disagree with them. It cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;even be refuted, which makes it silly from a popperian empiricist
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;view, but these people do not even feel they have to subscribe to that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;view. People with a different ontology and epistemology can be awfully
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;hard to convince that you are right...
</EM><BR>
<P>I've noticed it's become a bit of a trend these days to start throwing the
<BR>
word &quot;illusion&quot; at perceived effects. Unfortunately, doing this merely
<BR>
amounts to insubstantial wordplay and misdirection (perhaps in order to
<BR>
allow the offender to ignore such entities - keeping the thought required in
<BR>
building a rational framework of reality to a minimum - usually by valuing
<BR>
only the empirical - &quot;condemn it to the flame!&quot;). Remember, words like
<BR>
&quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;qualia&quot;, and as mentioned above, &quot;change&quot; are mere labels
<BR>
that have been applied to various perceived effects. Let's take &quot;change&quot;,
<BR>
for instance. Imagine that you are some entity able to view our universe
<BR>
outside of the influence of time. A good analogy for what they might &quot;see&quot;
<BR>
is of the electric wire game. (the one where you have to guide the metal
<BR>
hoop through a piece of charged convoluted wire - if your hands shake and
<BR>
the hoop touches the wire, the circuit is made and a buzzer signifies your
<BR>
failure). Imagine that we can only perceive the bit of wire within the hoop
<BR>
at any point in time. As the hoop is moved along the wire, &quot;time&quot;
<BR>
progresses. Of course, from this perpective, &quot;change&quot; is certainly a
<BR>
reality. It merely describes the difference between two perceptions of the
<BR>
same entity -the wire- given the passing of time - as the hoop is guided
<BR>
upward along the wire, we could notice the change in the relative densities
<BR>
of the wire from top to bottom, perhaps. Now, from the perspective of
<BR>
eternity, the viewer of the whole wire at once, time, and so change, is
<BR>
irrelevant - and might be called an &quot;illusion&quot; by one of these external
<BR>
observers. Pretty soon, another more wise observer would point out that in
<BR>
fact, an illusion is a misdirection. By witholding certain information, a
<BR>
magician will dupe the audience into thinking they are doing one thing, when
<BR>
in actual fact, something quite different is going on. In the case of
<BR>
change, no extra claims were ever made. Change is and always has been the
<BR>
label given to our perception of the passage of time in relation to entities
<BR>
that are fluid in time. The same goes for consciousness. It is merely the
<BR>
label given to the perceived effect of being, no mechanism for how this
<BR>
might be so is entangled in the label &quot;consciousness&quot;, and nor is anything
<BR>
about the objective nature of the effect. In the context of the magician's
<BR>
illusion, imagine urging everyone not to call the show &quot;magic&quot;, but instead
<BR>
something else, something that incorporates the reality of the situation,
<BR>
maybe &quot;magic trick&quot; or &quot;illusion&quot;. Of course, to be able to do this, you
<BR>
have to know what that something else is, and the original word has to imply
<BR>
something extra than merely pointing to the particular style of a magic
<BR>
show. &quot;Consciousness&quot;, &quot;Qualia&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; don't imply anything, they're
<BR>
merely pointers. So by calling such concepts &quot;illusions&quot; you are saying that
<BR>
words such as &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;change&quot; communicate more than just a
<BR>
pointer to the perceived effect, in fact, that they communicate something
<BR>
about the very nature of and the mechanisms behind the perceived effect.
<BR>
They do not. Consciousness, particularly, is a complete unknown. Nobody
<BR>
knows what it IS (from the perspective of eternity), what it's function is,
<BR>
or how exactly it is brought about, yet the &quot;illusion&quot; squad seem to think
<BR>
that the very word &quot;consciousness&quot; itself carries with it baggage that
<BR>
implies the contents of the black box, and that they know better. Wrong on
<BR>
both counts.
<BR>
To reiterate: When people talk of &quot;qualia&quot;, or &quot;consciousness&quot; or &quot;change&quot;
<BR>
they are merely &quot;pointing&quot; to the perceived effect. No claims are being made
<BR>
in the use of the word as to the specific nature or function of such
<BR>
entities. Calling these things an illusion from this perspective is clearly
<BR>
utterly meaningless. They DO exist, I and everybody else Do perceive them,
<BR>
and that perception is all that the label points to.
<BR>
