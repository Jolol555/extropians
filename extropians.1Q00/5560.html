Are you listening ETs!!!??? Gods!!!???? screw your &quot;prime directive&quot;, or any 
<BR>
other &quot;theodicy&quot; or excuse you can come up with for hiding and not helping. 
<BR>
Please get down hear and do whatever you can to help me save my parents and 
<BR>
everything else who is about to die.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Brent, I have had similar thoughts and feelings.  It would be nice if the 
<BR>
'galactic U.N.' would send rescue workers to our world to cure all our 
<BR>
diseases and to greatly extend lifespan.  But I honestly believe that even 
<BR>
if they are out there that they believe (and perhaps rightly) that we need 
<BR>
to develop and grow technologically and culturally without their 
<BR>
intervention.  They could greatly damage our potential and stifle us by 
<BR>
doing such a rescue effort.  You are thinking in terms of individual lives 
<BR>
but they may be thinking about the human race as a whole and see the deaths 
<BR>
of individuals as sad but a part of things until we deal with our problems 
<BR>
by developing the necessary technologies.  Growth through pain.
<BR>
<P>And we both know that at least some religions teach that this life is just 
<BR>
the blink of an eye to God and that we must simply endure and do the best we 
<BR>
can until it is over.  In the next life we will gain all the rewards we 
<BR>
deserve and see this life as a very short but crucial learning experience.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I guess, as long as there is something dieing about every second or so on 
<BR>
this planet, I won't be satisfied with an ET movie until the ETs in the 
<BR>
story come rushing in with their hospital ships, emergency rescue vehicles, 
<BR>
sirens a blazing and lights aflashing... or whatever, and do all they can to 
<BR>
help save those people from dieing before anything else. What's all this 
<BR>
crap about: &quot;What would you ask a more intelligent alien?&quot; The answer, it 
<BR>
seems to me, should be obvious.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see a film where this begins to happen but then the 'space 
<BR>
patrol' arrests them and they are tried for interfering with an inferior 
<BR>
civilization.  The focus of the film would be the trial.
<BR>
<P>you wrote:
<BR>
The question should be: &quot;How can I save my grandparents... and everything 
<BR>
else that is about to die down here before it is to late!?&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>If there is an afterlife then they will be alright but if not then it will 
<BR>
be a great loss.  Have you told them about cryonics?  Perhaps, they would 
<BR>
surprise you by being interested.
<BR>
<P>you wrote:
<BR>
How smart does an ET have to be before he knows that that is the one and 
<BR>
only most fundamental and important of all question or issue that must be 
<BR>
dealt with first before anything else?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>He just may not see things the way you do.  A different perspective and 
<BR>
value system that comes from a different culture and biology.  Again, 
<BR>
he/she/it may wish he could help us but it is better for us to make our own 
<BR>
way and gain the confidence and experience that would come from that.
<BR>
<P>you wrote:
<BR>
Until a movie or story or religion gets at least remotely close to such a 
<BR>
plain, simple, and fundamentally obvious truth, I'll be very disappointed 
<BR>
with any ET story or depiction of some supposed powerful God in some 
<BR>
religion or whatever. How can we, as a society, be so completely blind and 
<BR>
ignorant in all of our Sci-Fi fantasies and our religions to what seems to 
<BR>
me to be so blatantly obvious
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>In most sci-fi the alien tries to share the cure for cancer but is shot by 
<BR>
an ignorant mob!  Now, that could never happen, right?  And as for religion, 
<BR>
many clergy, believers and theologians have wrestled with this issue for 
<BR>
centuries, and had their own challenges with it.
<BR>
<P>Again, I think I understand where you are coming from.  But perhaps the 
<BR>
world is changing in a way so that the horrors you describe will be a thing 
<BR>
of the past in less then a century.  Perhaps.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
