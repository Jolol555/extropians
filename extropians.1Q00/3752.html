<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know, this may be old news around here, but I stumbled upon the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actual text of Clinton's National Nanotechnology Initiative...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/nni.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/nni.pdf</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I read it.  Items that disturb me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A)  How does *anyone* manage to write a 101-page paper on nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without using the words &quot;Drexler&quot;, &quot;Merkle&quot;, or &quot;Foresight&quot;?  Is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some deliberate conspiracy to shut Foresight out?  Does anyone on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commission know they exist?  Are these guys (1) being controlled by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Foresight from behind the scenes, (2) good friends of Foresight who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't mentioning Drexler so as to avoid triggering the bogosity meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of fools, (3) honestly so uninformed that they haven't read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_Nanosystems_, or (4) blood enemies of the Institute for Molecular 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Manufacturing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;C)  Much ado about spy/infotech aspects of nanotech and &quot;national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;security&quot;.  One brief mention of advanced-material fighter jets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nothing about about nanoweapons or active shields.  No quotes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Admiral Jeremiah.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Conclusion:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These people are deliberately avoiding all mention of diamondoid and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drextech.  I'm not sure whether they're good guys or bad guys, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't trust them.
</EM><BR>
<P>What they are is politicians.  I was also disappointed that they could dare 
<BR>
propose a national nanotechnology initiative (NNI) without any mention of 
<BR>
St. Drexler.  But in retrospect I can see why they did it.  NNI is going to 
<BR>
have to fight for its life in Congress against hundreds of other special 
<BR>
interests which want funding.  Any mention of Drexler would inevitably lead 
<BR>
NNI opponents to cite the most &quot;way-out&quot; drextech discussed in his writings 
<BR>
(&quot;impossible&quot; things like immortality and universal wealth) as &quot;proof&quot; that 
<BR>
NNI is nothing but an expensive pipe dream which would waste money that 
<BR>
should be spent on more &quot;practical&quot; scientific projects, like AIDS and 
<BR>
cancer research.
<BR>
<P>The pro-nano politicians (thank God for them - is this not reason enough to 
<BR>
vote for Gore in November?) also have to take every possible effort to make 
<BR>
sure none of the opposition hears anything about certain other things that 
<BR>
Drexler discusses, like the gray goo problem.  Get that on the national 
<BR>
radar and you can forget about NNI for a long time.  My guess is that 
<BR>
Drexler himself realizes the political realities of something so 
<BR>
revolutionary as NNI, and my guess is that he is not miffed about not being 
<BR>
mentioned in the proposal, particularly since (mentioned or not) Foresight 
<BR>
is likely to be one of the beneficiaries of NNI.
