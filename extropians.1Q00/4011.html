<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The way the Freenet system is designed to work, a given document may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stored on one or more server nodes.  Each node stores a certain number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of documents, ranked by priority.  When a document is fetched, its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rank is increased and that of all others is lowered.  When documents'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rankings drop below a certain level, they are deleted from the node,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although pointers are kept to other nodes where they may still be present.
</EM><BR>
<P>So unpopular opinions or information will be drowned out by the din of
<BR>
consensus. I guess I misspoke. It should be called PoliticallyCorrectNet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This produces a sort of crude &quot;economy&quot;, where document requests are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treated like payment to keep documents present in the system.  Documents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which are requested more often get higher rankings and get replicated on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple servers.  Documents which are requested too rarely eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get dropped from the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with this kind of system is that there is no method for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively determining the demand for a piece of information.  In terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the &quot;economy&quot;, document requests are too crude to serve as currency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they are too easily &quot;forged&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the other direction, the system attempts to offer publishing services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to anyone, without regard for ability to pay.  It is in effect a pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commons, and since there are no costs to publishers, we can expect that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the resource will be over-utilized.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So we are likely to see documents flooded into the system, both by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people trying to wash out the ones they don't like, and by genuine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users attracted by the free service.  People will create request bots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cooperative circles in order to keep their documents present (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to flush the ones they don't like out of the system).
</EM><BR>
<P>Given this, I don't think that this will fly due to pure economics. Memory space
<BR>
is cheap, while bandwidth is expensive. Your system is putting high demands on
<BR>
your scarce resource while putting low demands on your cheap resource.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's a highly unbalanced and fragile system which is unlikely to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much robustness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or much of anything, IMNSHO. Sorry Lee.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However it could still be a good testbed for the basic mechanisms for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; storing documents, moving them around, and so on.  If the ranking system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were updated to be more reasonable (based on real payments, for example)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then it could grow into a more stable system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Payments from whome? Lets see, you could get payments from requestors, in the
<BR>
form of subscriptions, or you could get your space sponsored, in the form of
<BR>
either advertisement base broadcasting or public television and radio (though
<BR>
they are both also taking advertizin these days).
<BR>
<P>Your system asks for server owners to provide free space to post information,
<BR>
which is fine, free bulletin boards have been going on since the Roman Empire.
<BR>
Its your ranking popularity system, and the abusinve traffic that will result,
<BR>
wasting bandwidth that will be the ruin of this concept.
