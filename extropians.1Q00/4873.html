</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In the current issue of Wired magazine is an article I did not expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to see, the author expresses great fear over Nanotechnology, computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; smarter than humans, and of course genetic engineering.  After expressing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sympathy for the ideas if not the methods of Ted Kaczynski, ... pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standard Luddite stuff, the bizarre thing is that the author is Bill Joy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; chief scientist and cofounder of Sun Microsystems.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have had a chance to read it now, and I was unhappy with it, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;several reasons.  For one thing, it is a one sided polemic.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, even with this emphasis, the dangers aren't really spelled out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very clearly.  For robotics, we are given only a quote from Moravec about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how they will inevitably out-compete humans.  We have discussed here in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the past the principle of comparative advantage, ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For nanotech it is the standard grey goo scenario, ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For genetic engineering it is any of the scary frankenfood scenarios ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With this rather sketchy outline of the dangers, Joy fleshes out his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;article with a rambling passage about the early days of the nuclear arms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;race, ...  He looks for essentially the same solution ... give up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them and stop working on them.  .... There is no discussion of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dangers of setting up such a universal monitoring system.  ... deaths of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poor people around the world if economic growth is thwarted ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In short, it's a powerful but one sided argument, strong on attack but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;short on defense.  ... the ideas seem so outlandish and impossible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implement that it seems unlikely to go anywhere.  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>As an academic, what stands out most to me is that it is a sermon, not an
<BR>
[academic-style] argument.  It is not going to convince the people I talk
<BR>
to the most, but might well influence other sorts of people.
<BR>
<P>He writes: &quot;But if we are downloaded into our technology, what are the
<BR>
chances that we will thereafter be ourselves or even human? It seems to me
<BR>
far more likely that a robotic existence would not be like a human one in
<BR>
any sense that we understand, that the robots would in no sense be our
<BR>
children, that on this path our humanity may well be lost.&quot;

<BR>
<P>I think this is his key intuition, and is the key intuition that drives most
<BR>
fears of the future.  It is like the proverbial grumpy grandpa, who sees
<BR>
that the kids today are not like he was, and fears the &quot;world is going to
<BR>
hell in a handbasket.&quot;  He knows that the &quot;moral fiber&quot; of his generation is
<BR>
what kept them from the abyss.  And if his no good grandson exceeds some
<BR>
threshold of tolerable difference, why he's just going to disinherit him,
<BR>
ha, and strike a blow for decency everywhere.
<BR>
<P>This sort of grumpy grandpa neglects how different his generation is
<BR>
from the generations that went on before him, and how little his ancestors
<BR>
ten or ten thousand generations back might have approved of how his generation
<BR>
lived.  With a broader historical perspective, such a grumpy grandpa would
<BR>
probably realize how wide the range of environments are that can make folks
<BR>
happy and productive, and might then accept this grandkids world a bit more.
<BR>
<P>Yes, on a social level Bill &quot;Long Now&quot; Joy seems such a historically narrow
<BR>
grumpy grandpa.  If his descendants incrementally and voluntarily choose to
<BR>
become more robotic, why Bill is horrified, and fears true human decency
<BR>
is lost.  That's now the way it was when he was a kid, by gum, why if God
<BR>
had intended men to fly, he'd have given us wings.
<BR>
<P>Btw, I find it curious people are shocked to find that they might agree
<BR>
with something Kaczynski wrote.  Would they be shocked if Kaczynski had
<BR>
written that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that computers will get cheaper?
<BR>
Why must a person who does evil things be wrong about everything?
