Hiya!
<BR>
<P>Many of you have probably seen Bruce Sterling's 3/1/2000 manifesto by
<BR>
now. (If anyone asks me I'll repost it to the list; it's a bit long, 
<BR>
though ...)
<BR>
<P>I subscribed to the mailing list. There's a lot more out there than
<BR>
Chairman Bruce's initial public manifesto made clear. In a nutshell,
<BR>
he's trying to set up a new (art|environmental|political|ideological)
<BR>
movement. 
<BR>
<P>Axioms of Viridianism (as I understand it):
<BR>
<P>* Viridianism comes with an expiry date: 1-December-2012. (This is to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid the &quot;is cyberpunk dead, yet?&quot; problem; as Sterling says, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone who _still_ doesn't get it by then is going to be unreachable.)
<BR>
<P>* It's very concerned with the environment,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT
<BR>
<P>* It explicitly reject irrationalism, superstition, and anti-technological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bias.
<BR>
<P>* As a civilization, we have a major carbon dioxide abuse problem. We
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;need to work out how to deal with this. (NOTE: no hint of anti-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear or anti-space sentiment here. This ain't your usual green
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;politics.) In particular, we need to deal with the entrenched industries
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and interest groups that make short-term profit at the expense of shitting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in their own back yard.
<BR>
<P>* Leave the teen-agers and kids alone; this is a movement for old folks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who feel some responsibility for the world they live in.
<BR>
<P>* Cops and soldiers are our friends. Terrorists are not. Forget the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;underground romanticism of traditional subversive organisations. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;goal of Viridianism is not to emulate the Black Panthers but to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentally change the framework of political debate over the next
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;decade: if the police are going to be arresting people at the end of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this period it won't be us, it'll be the polluters we oppose.
<BR>
<P>* All movements need a handy opposition, which is why we're picking on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polluters. (Cynical self-conscious admission that, well, the movement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exists because it's a movement, as well as to follow its goals.)
<BR>
<P>Other axioms that came out of the manifesto:
<BR>
<P>* Forget isms and ideologies -- they're twentieth-century hokum that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't work. Instead, pick whatever works and run with it.
<BR>
<P>* Technology is cool. Change is cool. The future is overlapping and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increasingly rapid waves of change.
<BR>
<P>* The first decade of the 21st century is going to be a lot like the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;first decade of the 20th century, psychologically and culturally;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the big bugaboo will be environmental damage and global warming 2.0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which supersedes the imperialist militarism 1.0 release which brought
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;us world war one.
<BR>
<P>Comment:
<BR>
<P>I find this fascinating -- it's the first sign of a green ideology
<BR>
emerging that isn't implicitly, or explicitly, entropian.  Not that I'd
<BR>
have expected entropy from Bruce, who's a sizzling powerhouse of ideas,
<BR>
but I'm so used to seeing environmentalist-based ideas corrupted by the
<BR>
dreadful streak of pessimism about human potential that runs through
<BR>
most green politics that an _optimistic_ techno-green movement comes as
<BR>
a welcome surprise. 
<BR>
<P>As far as I can see, Viridianism runs orthogonally to some extropian
<BR>
currents -- it says nothing about transhumanism and it's not
<BR>
pro-libertarian, but neither is it opposed to life extension research
<BR>
or AI, and it explicitly eschews existing political ideologies as
<BR>
prescriptive strait-jackets. And, as befits the new century, it's a
<BR>
disposable movement that comes with a built-in expiry date. (If global
<BR>
warming isn't an established issue in politics at every level by 2012,
<BR>
either it doesn't exist -- pack up bags, go home, say &quot;sorry, I was
<BR>
wrong&quot; -- or it's going to take more than a cultural movement to put it
<BR>
on the table.)
<BR>
<P>Why do I have this weird, creepy feeling that, in combination with 
<BR>
extropian ideas leaking out into the general media, we are seeing a sea-
<BR>
change in the ideological underpinnings of our culture? On the way out
<BR>
go deep green &quot;original sin&quot; ideologies (&quot;we must stop breeding and go
<BR>
back to subsistence agriculture and bashing each other on the head with
<BR>
ricks, for we are sinful and can only destroy the environment&quot;), 
<BR>
totalitarian ideologies (communism, fascism: both assert &quot;we own your
<BR>
body, we control human nature&quot; -- communism being class-based and fascism
<BR>
being state- or race-based). In come new ideas, fighting to make headway
<BR>
against an increasingly bureaucratic, control-oriented, disengaged
<BR>
establishment.
