<EM>&gt;Stewart, isn't the concept of &quot;species&quot; somewhat specious itself?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I.e. there is no fixed line defining the variation among individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a single species, versus the existence of two or more distinct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species.  It seems to be a matter of argument among individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specialists in that particular branch of biology.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's sort of like having more powerful telescopes -- the more deeply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you look, the more stars you see.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is briefly mentioned in chapter 34 &quot;Species Loss Revisited&quot; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_The State of Humanity_ by Julian L. Simon, ISBN 1-55786-119-6.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you can't tell what a species is, it's hard to inventory them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or determine whether we're gaining or losing them.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the concept of species has held up surprisingly well, and 
<BR>
fruitfully for biology.  Example of the fruitfulness: Darwin. 
<BR>
Analysis of the dynamics of any biological community begins with 
<BR>
species identification; without it you have nothing.  (My first 
<BR>
training was as a biologist at Stanford, and I stay current, if only 
<BR>
for the high yield of useful metaphors.)
<BR>
<P>There are certainly soft edges of definition at times, and some 
<BR>
microbes are famously promiscuous with their traits, and the debate 
<BR>
between &quot;splitters&quot; and &quot;lumpers&quot; in taxonomy continues, yet to me 
<BR>
one of the most astonishing phenomena of all biology is the stability 
<BR>
of species.  Red squirrels are under constant pressure from black 
<BR>
squirrels to succumb or interbreed in central Michigan; their habitat 
<BR>
has altered drastically from white pine forests to jack pine and farm 
<BR>
land; the niche swerved, and yet the species is absolutely intact.  I 
<BR>
find that constancy far more marvelous, and harder to explain, than 
<BR>
the origins of species.
<BR>
<P>Happily the arrival of DNA analysis has clarified matters enormously, 
<BR>
showing both the specificity of species and their relations and 
<BR>
history.  Hence a note from Peter Warshall the other day noting that 
<BR>
storks now appear to be a weird form of vulture, or vice versa. 
<BR>
Meanwhile vultures and storks continue to make up a highly distinct 
<BR>
and stable set of species.  Try looking a Marobou stork in the eye 
<BR>
(they're your height) and explaining about Julian Simon's theories of 
<BR>
biology.  That same stork eyeballed the first humans.
<BR>
<P>Recall that identification of &quot;genes&quot; is a long debated issue.  Yet 
<BR>
there they are, and the Human Genome Project shows what value you get 
<BR>
when you identify and map them all.
