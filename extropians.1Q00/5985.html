<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; According to Michael S. Lorrey I'm a fascist.  But I think his is a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; broad definition of that term.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How would you define it?  How would you claim Michael defines it?  How are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you not one?  Why would Michael think you are one?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I define a &quot;fascist&quot; as one who advocates a system of government marked by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael has never given (to my knowledge) his definition of a fascist, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he has alluded to the fact that he considers me to be one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am not a fascist because I don't advocate fascism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that Michael thinks I'm a fascist because I am in favor of gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control and ubiquitous transparancy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that you also beleive that people are entitled to
<BR>
'equitable' distribution of other peoples property (i.e. the food a
<BR>
farmer produces should be taken from him at cost), this indicates some
<BR>
socialist leanings. That you are for total surveillance of everyone,
<BR>
including politically incorrect and/or subversive characters (whether
<BR>
its everyone or just a small controlling group that controls the system
<BR>
is irrelevant), and the confiscation of people's abilities to defend
<BR>
themselves against thugs (individual or governmental), which are both
<BR>
policies used by fascists to hold onto power and eliminate opposition,
<BR>
indicates to me that you lean toward the policies espoused by a
<BR>
political party once known as the National Socialist Workers Party. Your
<BR>
only saving grace is that so far as I can tell, you wish to oppress
<BR>
everyone equally, rather than just on minority you'd prefer to pick on
<BR>
(then again, you've said a lot of things denigrating white undereducated
<BR>
males living in rural areas, so maybe you do have those leanings as
<BR>
well), but thats not much of a positive feature. Arguments you've made
<BR>
on this list show that you support a minimum of 2/3 of the planks on the
<BR>
platform found in the Communist Manifesto.
<BR>
<P>You can protest all you want, but its your own words that have placed
<BR>
you in this category. If you don't like that people see you as placing
<BR>
yourself in this category, then maybe you need to really examine what
<BR>
you beleive. Any time you find yourself saying,&quot;I beleive that people
<BR>
should have this freedom, but.....&quot; check yourself. Its that 'but' that
<BR>
kills.
