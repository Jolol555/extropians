<EM>&gt;it is natural to have in societies people who disagree

<EM>&gt;a large society that agrees 100% all of the time; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When someone expresses an opinion I consider extremist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and stupid, (as happens often on this list) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sometimes remind myself that societies NEED
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extremists. They're part of the natural order; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debates they engender strengthen societies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exercise our minds. Their presence helps to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;societies balanced. Hell, sometimes the extremist are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even RIGHT.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I find extremists to be the largest
<BR>
impediment to getting people to take extreme ideas
<BR>
seriously.
<BR>
<P>Society needs different ideas to be explored, and it
<BR>
is fine if different people specialize in exploring
<BR>
different ideas.  But that doesn't need they need to
<BR>
*believe* in those extreme ideas, and hence disagree
<BR>
extremely.   (In fact, I have a paper on why rational
<BR>
creatures should not agree to disagree.)
<BR>
<P>Think of the analogy of wearing suits.  A simple story
<BR>
about wearing suits at work is that there are a few
<BR>
bozos out there who refuse, and they aren't desirable
<BR>
workers.  So everyone else distinguishes themselves
<BR>
from these bozos by wearing a suit, even though they
<BR>
don't like it.  If there weren't such bozos, there
<BR>
wouldn't be a need to wear suits, and everyone would
<BR>
be happier.
<BR>
<P>Similarly with ideas, the reason most people I know
<BR>
resist exploring extreme ideas is that the only people
<BR>
they've seen exploring them are these bozos they do
<BR>
not want others to confuse them with.  So they back
<BR>
off, even though they find the ideas intrinsically
<BR>
interesting.  Just yesterday I talked with a very
<BR>
smart colleague who did not want to hear about nanotech
<BR>
because once years ago some idiot at a party cornered
<BR>
him and blathered on and on about it with very
<BR>
poorly conceived ideas and arguments.
