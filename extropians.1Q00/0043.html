Perhaps the most exciting life-enhancing agent is huperzine A
<BR>
(HupA), which, based on the published research, I believe is
<BR>
the most potent memory-enhancing agent available, far superior 
<BR>
to gingko. Studies also routinely find HupA to be significantly 
<BR>
more potent than the prescription drug for Alzheimer's disease
<BR>
tacrine. HupA improves memory by increasing levels of the 
<BR>
memory-essential neurotransmitter acetylcholine by inhibiting 
<BR>
acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetylcholine. HupA
<BR>
is available over the counter at many health-food stores
<BR>
and is a naturally occurring chemical from Chinese moss.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>The following studies found that HupA is also neuroprotective.

<P>The effects of Huperzine A (HupA), a novel acetylcholinesterase 
<BR>
inhibitor, on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced cell lesion, level 
<BR>
of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities were 
<BR>
investigated in rat pheochromocytoma line PC12. Following a 6-h 
<BR>
exposure of the cells to H2O2 (200 microM), a marked reduction 
<BR>
in cell survival and activities of glutathione peroxidase and 
<BR>
catalase, as well as increased production of malondialdehyde 
<BR>
(MDA) were observed. Pretreatment of the cells with HupA 
<BR>
(0.1-10.0 microM) prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated 
<BR>
the cell survival and antioxidant enzyme activities and decreased 
<BR>
the level of MDA. Our results indicated that in addition to its
<BR>
anticholinesterase effects, HupA had protective effects against 
<BR>
free radical-induced cell toxicity, which might be beneficial 
<BR>
for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

<P>Huperzine a, a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, 
<BR>
inhibits acetylcholinesterase in primary cultures derived from 
<BR>
forebrain, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of embryonic rat 
<BR>
brain. Glutamate induces cell death in cultures from all these 
<BR>
brain regions. Maximum cell toxicity was observed in cerebellar 
<BR>
cultures. Pretreatment of cell cultures with Huperzine A reduced 
<BR>
cell toxicity, as evidenced by cytotoxicity assay and general 
<BR>
morphology. Huperzine A pretreatment also reduced glutamate-
<BR>
induced calcium mobilization, but did not affect elevations in 
<BR>
intraneuronal free Ca2+ ([Ca]i) caused by KCl or (-)Bay K 8644. 
<BR>
The data suggest that Huperzine A could be a potent 
<BR>
neuroprotective agent not only where cholinergic neurons are 
<BR>
impaired, but also under conditions in which glutamatergic 
<BR>
functions are compromised.

<P>Efficacy of huperzine in preventing soman-induced seizures,
<BR>
neuropathological changes and lethality.

<BR>
<P>Huperzine A (HUP) is a potent reversible inhibitor of 
<BR>
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that crosses the blood-brain 
<BR>
barrier. Its ability to prevent seizures and subsequent 
<BR>
hippocampal neuropathological changes induced by the 
<BR>
organophosphate soman was studied in guinea pigs. Results 
<BR>
were compared to guinea pigs treated with pyridostigmine 
<BR>
(PYR, 0.2 mg/kg, subcutaneously). HUP pretreatment at 0.5 
<BR>
mg/kg, intraperitoneally, totally prevented seizures and 
<BR>
ensured the survival of all animals for 24 h after intoxication. 
<BR>
Hippocampal tissue was then free of any neuronal damage. 
<BR>
Comparatively, all animals pretreated with PYR exhibited 
<BR>
epileptic activity after soman poisoning and five of six 
<BR>
animals died. Examination of the hippocampus of the only 
<BR>
surviving guinea pig pretreated with PYR showed extensive 
<BR>
neuropathological changes. Although HUP or PYR induced 
<BR>
similar inhibitions of blood AChE activity, only HUP 
<BR>
pretreatment led to a decrease in central AChE activity. 
<BR>
In binding studies on guinea-pig brain homogenates, HUP 
<BR>
had no affinity for muscarinic, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-
<BR>
methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and gamma-
<BR>
aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and only a very low 
<BR>
one for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In 
<BR>
conclusion, HUP, unlike PYR, protects against soman-
<BR>
induced convulsions and neuropathological changes in the 
<BR>
hippocampus. This efficacy seems to be related to a 
<BR>
protection by HUP of both peripheral and central stores of AChE.
