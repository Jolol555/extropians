PRINCETON, N.J. -- Princeton University researchers have developed a kind of 
<BR>
computer that uses the biological molecule RNA to solve complex problems. The 
<BR>
achievement marks a significant advance in molecular computing, an emerging 
<BR>
field in which scientists are harnessing molecules such as DNA and RNA to 
<BR>
solve certain problems more efficiently than could be done by conventional 
<BR>
computing. 
<BR>
In work to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
<BR>
Sciences, the Princeton scientists used a test tube containing 1,024 
<BR>
different strands of RNA to solve a simple version of the &quot;knight problem,&quot; a 
<BR>
chess puzzle that is representative of a class of problems that requires 
<BR>
brute-force computing. The knight problem asks how many and where can one 
<BR>
place knights on a chessboard so they can not attack each other. For the 
<BR>
purposes of their experiment, the researchers restricted the board to just 
<BR>
nine squares, so there were 512 possible combinations. Of these, the RNA 
<BR>
computer correctly identified 43 solutions. 
<BR>
<P>It also produced one incorrect response, highlighting the need to develop 
<BR>
error-checking techniques in chemical computing. 
<BR>
<P>This test-tube computer does not have any immediate applications, and it will 
<BR>
probably never completely replace silicon technology. But it does have 
<BR>
attractive aspects, said assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary 
<BR>
biology Laura Landweber who led the research project in collaboration with 
<BR>
professor of computer science Richard Lipton, and postdoctoral fellow Dirk 
<BR>
Faulhammer and a student, Anthony Cukras. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It begs the question, What is a computer?&quot; said Landweber. &quot;A computer can 
<BR>
be an abacus, it can be many types of devices. This is really an abstraction 
<BR>
of a computer.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>One advantage, said Landweber, is that the genetic molecules DNA and RNA, 
<BR>
which encode all the instructions for creating and running life, can store 
<BR>
much more data in a given space than conventional memory chips. Another 
<BR>
benefit is that, with vast numbers of genetic fragments floating in a test 
<BR>
tube, a biomolecular computer could perform thousands or millions of 
<BR>
calculations at the same time. It is an extreme example of parallel 
<BR>
computing, which is a rapidly growing area of computer technology. 
<BR>
<P>For example, in the knight problem, each strand of RNA represented a possible 
<BR>
solution, but the researchers did not need to sort through each one 
<BR>
individually; in a series of five steps, a specially targeted enzyme slashed 
<BR>
away all the strands that did not match the requirements of a correct 
<BR>
solution. Researchers believe that such techniques could be valuable for 
<BR>
problems that need to be solved by trial and error, where it is cumbersome to 
<BR>
test possible solutions one at a time. 
<BR>
<P>DNA computing has attracted considerable attention from researchers since 
<BR>
1994 when Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California used DNA 
<BR>
to solve a version of an archetypal problem called the traveling salesman 
<BR>
problem. The idea is that words written in the letters of DNA, referred to as 
<BR>
A, T, C and G, could represent the ones and zeroes used in computer logic. 
<BR>
Computing is accomplished by eliminating molecules whose sequences appear to 
<BR>
be poor solutions and retaining ones that seem more promising. The output of 
<BR>
final molecules can be read like the holes punched in an old-fashioned 
<BR>
computer tape. 
<BR>
<P>Landweber found that substituting RNA for DNA gave her more flexibility in 
<BR>
developing a computing system. With DNA, there is a limited set of 
<BR>
restriction enzymes - a kind of molecular scissors - so scientists may not be 
<BR>
able to cut the molecule where they want. With RNA, Landweber's group could 
<BR>
use just one universal enzyme that targets any part of the molecule. This 
<BR>
aspect streamlines their approach and makes it inherently 'scalable' to 
<BR>
larger problems.
