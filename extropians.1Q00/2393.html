<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I was bouncing a couple of ideas about with some of my colleagues
<BR>
today, discussing how to shut down the internet. (We're an e-commerce
<BR>
enabler firm -- we processess credit cards. So security is a perennial 
<BR>
obsession.) Somehow we drifted onto the topic of distributed denial
<BR>
of service attacks such as TriNoo and Tribe Flood Network and whatever
<BR>
took down Yahoo yesterday; and we also got onto the topic of the RTM
<BR>
worm.
<BR>
<P>&lt;SIDE_TRACK&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I like metaphors. (I'm not particularly bright, and they make it easier
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for me to grasp weird new technologies and explore their possibilities.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they work properly, that is.) I particularly like the metaphor of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nanotech assembler (or the ribosome, for that matter) as being a compiler.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think I already mentioned the idea of using the Thompson Hack to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent assemblers being used for the construction of obvious weapons
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of mass destruction, even in an environment where the blueprints for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;assemblers are widespread, leading to the proliferation of customized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nanoassemblers for special tasks. I'm still trying to explore this idea's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;implications, using the compiler metaphor. If you bear with me through
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the software discussion I'll get to the grey goop ...)
<BR>
<P>&lt;/SIDE_TRACK&gt;
<BR>
<P>While we were discussing DDoS attacks, a couple of paranoid ideas occured
<BR>
to me.  The first was: how is it possible to set up a DDoS attack in the
<BR>
first place? Obviously, you need to spread the DDoS clients to as many
<BR>
host systems as possible. This typically requires a degree of social
<BR>
engineering insofar as you need to make people trust you enough to run
<BR>
your system -- relying on an external intrusion (like the RTM worm)
<BR>
may work once, and is vastly easier in a monoculture, but isn't necessarily
<BR>
reliable: if someone else discovers the security hole your worm relies on
<BR>
and patches it before you pull the trigger, you've lost.
<BR>
<P>One way of earning trust is to look like something else -- something
<BR>
that obviously needs to take data from a central source and do something
<BR>
with it, but something that is nevertheless benign.  For example,
<BR>
take Seti@Home. The Seti@Home clients are closed-source! They regularly
<BR>
download batches of data, process it in mysterious ways, and upload the
<BR>
results to a central server. If I was an infowarrior from Big Black,
<BR>
I'd be drooling at the prospects and doing my damndest to get my hands
<BR>
on the Seti@Home network. All it takes is a minor modification to the
<BR>
client software, so that if it sees a data set with a certain attribute,
<BR>
it triggers a fork()/exec() and executes the data set as a process instead
<BR>
of processing it as SETI data. This would enable a hypothetical attacker,
<BR>
who has set themselves up by disguising themselves as a charitable concern
<BR>
like Seti@Home or distributed.net, to launch a massive simultaneous DDoS
<BR>
attack on some target, by downloading DDoS client software disguised as
<BR>
a new SETI dataset.
<BR>
<P>(If you have access to the operating system authors and the compiler
<BR>
sources as well, you can do something even more scary: the Thompson
<BR>
hack springs to mind again. _Anything_ that grabs data from a socket and
<BR>
writes it to a file handle can be turned into a vicious trojan if it
<BR>
sees a specific signature in its data stream, and you'll never be able
<BR>
to find it unless you keep a low-level debugger pointed at your kernel,
<BR>
because it's your TCP/IP stack that has been compromised.)
<BR>
<P>But I digress ...
<BR>
<P>Nanoassemblers will exist in an economy. They will be used as matter
<BR>
compilers, and they will be operated on source code at the discretion of
<BR>
their owners. Thus, scope for human engineering creeps in. Having kicked
<BR>
around the idea of what you can do to a single compromised, untrustworthy
<BR>
strain of assembler, I'm trying to figure out what you can do with a
<BR>
_distributed_ assembler hack.
<BR>
<P>The Thompson hack basically lets you create compilers that scan their
<BR>
input stream for some signature and snitch on you (or execute some
<BR>
arbitrary payload) if they see it. The nasty sting in the tail of
<BR>
this idea is that the scanner/payload isn't visible in the source code
<BR>
to the compiler; because one of the scanner/payload combinations in a
<BR>
contaminated compiler is designed to add the patch whenever it recognizes
<BR>
its own source code being re-compiled. With application to assemblers
<BR>
(or, more likely, their control software aboard the nanocomputers used
<BR>
to direct them), this would mean that if you try to assemble some grey
<BR>
goo, the assembler will recognize the grey goo, and assemble something
<BR>
else instead -- probably a pair of handcuffs.  And you can't build an
<BR>
assembler that _won't_ snitch on you without doing it by hand, without
<BR>
involving any off-the-shelf assemblers in the process: because they'll
<BR>
try to propagate the Thompson hack into your new &quot;clean&quot; assembler.
<BR>
<P>The logical next step, if we view this as an enforcement arms race, is
<BR>
for the guys in the black hats to look for ways around the hack. Two
<BR>
ways spring to mind:
<BR>
<P>#1  Build a clean assembler. To do this, build unrecognizable tools
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(at least, to the scanners in the contaminated assemblers) that can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be combined to build something that can compile a clean assembler.
<BR>
<P>#2  Build a weapon than doesn't look like a weapon to the contaminated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assemblers. 
<BR>
<P>I suspect #2 is going to be easier. And I'd look to a distributed service
<BR>
attack propagated by human engineering as a way of doing this without 
<BR>
detection. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;EXAMPLE&gt;
<BR>
<P>*  This is a firearm-free district. The nanoassembly of GAU-27s is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;banned (as is private ownership of ICBMs). The ban is enforced by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snitch patterns that all local assemblers recognize. The patterns
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are regularly updated with all the open-source algorithms for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gatling assembly that are floating around the net.
<BR>
<P>*  Building a GAU-27 isn't a single task (&quot;stuck ingredients in vat,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add assemblers, wave magic wand, remove anti-tank gun&quot;). Different
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;components require different treatments and need to be brought together
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in sequence to produce a whole machine.
<BR>
<P>*  The snitch circuits specifically target critical path steps in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production cycle that are characteristic of building a gatling gun
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;insert six tubes through performated metal disk; align with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convergence angle foo, weld into position&quot;) rather than any other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure (&quot;lay down a perforated metal disk bar centimetres in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diameter, quux millimetres thick ...&quot;) that might be part of something
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else. In fact, it'll probably take a sequence of such steps to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinctively identify the fact that the assembler is working on a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAU-27, as opposed to, say, a replica steam engine boiler. (Lots of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parallel tubes held in place by welding ...)
<BR>
<P>*  Therefore the job of the black hats is to distribute the critical steps
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the construction sequence so that no one assembler (or family tree
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of assemblers, if they're building a macroscopic artefact and tracking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicious patterns from generation to generation via some sort of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analog of telomeres in their instruction set) gets to see the full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picture.
<BR>
<P>*  It might be as simple as &quot;stop: alert human operator! Eject pipe-like
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structures and disk from tank! Await new material input.&quot;  While the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humans take care of the step the pattern recognizers are looking for.
<BR>
<P>*  More likely, it'll be along the lines of a piece of spam saying &quot;hi!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a real cool design for a gold bee that you can use as living
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jewellery! Feed me to your household assembler now!&quot; -- Carrying a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payload that will migrate to a final assembly ground using GPS or 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever to navigate, then self-assemble (at a macroscopic scale) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into something nasty.
<BR>
<P>&lt;/EXAMPLE&gt;
<BR>
<P>On a large scale a nanotech attack may be an analogue of the seti@home
<BR>
corruption described above -- one that works on a system where people
<BR>
download designs from a trusted source, build them, then post them to
<BR>
a destination that will make use of them, all with the idea of doing
<BR>
something useful. (&quot;You too can help colonize Tau Ceti! Download our
<BR>
designs for an endothermic neutron irradiation source and help manufacture
<BR>
DT fuel pellets in the comfort of your own home! Send your upload to
<BR>
the stars!&quot; And all the time you're sending the Traditional IRA splinter
<BR>
group fusion pellets for their forthcoming H-bomb campaign against the 
<BR>
EU.)  
<BR>
<P>This sort of cooperative attack _will_ happen; it's just too tempting.
<BR>
Here's another example: 
<BR>
<P>&lt;EXAMPLE&gt;
<BR>
<P>You drive GNU station wagon 18.3, the Emacs of the automotive world.
<BR>
GNUsw is a great car. You have to paint it yourself, but it comes with
<BR>
steam, diesel, coal, nuclear, and solar power options, two to sixteen
<BR>
wheels, optional hovercraft assist, and it's self-repairing. (And it's
<BR>
a free design, unlike Ford's latest style offering that looks infinitely
<BR>
nicer but expires after twelve months unless you keep paying your license 
<BR>
fees.)
<BR>
<P>GNUsw just happens to have a facility for auto-upgrading itself: it 
<BR>
periodically downloads a set of design improvements from the Free Hardware
<BR>
Foundation's CVS archive, fabricates them, and integrates them into
<BR>
its structure. 
<BR>
<P>This works fine ... until the black hats get at the Free Hardware
<BR>
Foundation. They suborn the FHF archive, and publish a &quot;design
<BR>
improvement&quot; that lies dormant until a certain date, then turns a station
<BR>
wagon into the equivalent of an M1A2. On that date, suddenly your car
<BR>
turns into a vicious armoured killing machine -- along with those of
<BR>
sixteen million of your neighbours.  The scanners embedded in the GNUsw's
<BR>
own assembler suite don't spot the purpose of this design change because
<BR>
the tanks aren't actually carrying guns -- when you weigh sixty tons and
<BR>
can outrun a Jaguar you don't _need_ to :) -- and the tanks are still
<BR>
basically land-going passenger vehicles. The lethal bit is the control
<BR>
software, which has a pattern recognizer for humans that will make the
<BR>
tanks chase them until they turn into red smears.
<BR>
<P>(By the way, it's not just GNU I'm picking on here; the same attack could
<BR>
easily come through a closed-source commercial venture. It's equivalent to
<BR>
the macro viruses so common today on Windows; a vulnerability caused by
<BR>
the system having facilities to permit self-extension, combined with the
<BR>
ability to execute instructions sent from an implicitly trusted source.)
<BR>
<P>&lt;/EXAMPLE&gt;
<BR>
<P>Summary:
<BR>
<P>* Nanoassemblers are compilers.
<BR>
<P>* As such, they can be rigged to &quot;snitch&quot; if used to build something
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;undesirable.
<BR>
<P>* The logical response to this is to use a distributed attack that causes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;no one assembler family to build something undesirable.
<BR>
<P>* Artefacts that posess the capability to autonomously extend or modify
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves are very vulnerable to this sort of attack.
<BR>
<P>* So are distributed networks that process instructions from a remote host.
<BR>
<P>Can anyone pick any holes in this line of thought?
