On Wed, 15 Mar 2000, Spike Jones wrote about the FUZION 150:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Holy schlaMOLY here it comes:
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... well someone there has trouble counting since one story says
<BR>
80+ million.  But IBM is going for 170 million!
<BR>
<P>See: <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2466014,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2466014,00.html</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; PixelFusion's FUZION 150 is a 0.25 micron, single-chip,
</EM><BR>
Gads, its obsolete before it hits the street.  SotA is 0.18 microns now
<BR>
while IBM is going to 0.13 microns Q3 next year.  If the fabless
<BR>
companies get into a position of being 2 generations behind, you
<BR>
have to wonder if they will be able to compete.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 24 megabits of on-chip embedded DRAM.
</EM><BR>
Great!  A *real* PIM (processor in memory) chip that you can buy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This ultra high-performance chip delivers more than 1.5 trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operations or 3 billion floating-point operations per second,
</EM><BR>
<P>Well the 1.5 TeraOps are integer operations, but if I can do &quot;synapse&quot;
<BR>
arithmetic with them, with ~700 of them you get a peta-op which is about
<BR>
in the middle of estimates for &quot;brain-equivalence&quot;.  However since it
<BR>
consumes about 30W, that works out to ~20,000 Watts.  I doubt I'm
<BR>
going to run it at home.  Gotta do something about that.
<BR>
<P>Of course you get interesting architectures, here is my 1 W transmeta
<BR>
chip doing general purpose computing connected to my 30 W video
<BR>
chip to display all the fancy graphics...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; along with 600 gigabytes per second of on-chip memory bandwidth.
</EM><BR>
This is what PIM *really* buys you which is great.  It isn't the
<BR>
arithmetic the brain does that gives it the power, its the
<BR>
internal communciations bandwidth.  So with this much on chip
<BR>
bandwidth a few thousand of them (with optical interconnects) gets
<BR>
in the ballpark of the bandwidth in the brain.
<BR>
<P>Now you did miss the *interesting* thing about the chip -- it comes
<BR>
in a 1060 pin HPBGA (high performance ball grid array?) package
<BR>
and measures 4.5 cm square (big!).
<BR>
<P>So, we assume in ~10 years or less we can knock an order of magnitude
<BR>
off of the power budget and # of processors.  So, looks like by 2010
<BR>
we will get me a desktop machine with a reasonable power budget and
<BR>
something close to brain capacity.  So we only have 10 years to figure
<BR>
out how to program the thing.
