<EM>&gt; Really? lol  A person could easily die in their home if they live alone
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be lying there decaying for several days before someone comes for them!
</EM><BR>
So
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a dedicated cryonicist must be married with eight kids or have a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; roommates or boarders!  Take your choice! :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Possible, yes, but it doesn't happen very often.  Most of us do live with
<BR>
someone, and most young people don't die quietly in their sleep anyway.  I
<BR>
forget the exact current list of leading causes of death (does anyone have
<BR>
it handy?), but I believe most of the big items are things like cancer
<BR>
(where you have time to make your arrangements) and auto accidents (very
<BR>
public, so an ambulance usually arrives before you die).
<BR>
<P>You're arguing that it is possible for cryonics arrangements to fall
<BR>
through.  Well, DUH.  No system is 100% reliable.  But your odds of actually
<BR>
getting suspended if you are signed up are very high.
<BR>
<P>Come to think of it - has there ever been a case of someone who was signed
<BR>
up not getting suspended?  I can't remember one, but I only get news about
<BR>
Alcor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What do you mean by regular in nature?  The processes by which decay of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain structure happens?  Again, I find myself thinking that I hope an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimist in this area is right but I think more research is necessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course we need more research.  The better your model of the process is,
<BR>
the more successful you will be at running it backwards.
