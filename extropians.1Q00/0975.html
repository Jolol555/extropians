Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If we ended aging *tomorrow* (January 19, 2000), the population growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rate would only increase marginally.  It would take decades for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increases to get compounded into a serious problem.  By that time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I expect that (a) people would discover en masse the validity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of reasons for vacating the planet, or (b) why longevity is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such a good idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an hypothesis -- a bit debatable but let's not go into that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now whether ending aging tomorrow would be &quot;good for the species as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a whole&quot; depends a lot on whether you think having your expectations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of your future life *ripped* from your mind and sliced and diced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the meme-cutting-room-floor.  *Most* people would consider that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad.  Of course I'm not very interested in &quot;dying&quot; for &quot;most&quot; people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(After all, what have they done for *me* lately....)
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I disagree, that extropians don't have &quot;ecological concerns&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I consider myself a highly &quot;ecological&quot; person in that, if possible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't want to have to expend resources tomorrow cleaning up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any mess I made today (unless someone can show me concretely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that &quot;tomorrow&quot; cleanups are cheaper than &quot;today&quot; cleanups).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As I expect that analysis is problematic, it makes sense to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me to cleanup today and enjoy the &quot;good life&quot; tomorrow.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a more sensible view. But I doubt you would find many fans around the
<BR>
extropians. Or perhaps you might even find fans but I'm sure we would
<BR>
disagree in what would the threshold be for deciding if some messing up
<BR>
wouldn't be able to be cleaned tomorrow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If the bodies are physical, the limits are more &quot;real&quot; than if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bodies are virtual (primarily due to the fact that &quot;suspending&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtual bodies is easy, while &quot;suspending&quot; real bodies is problematic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ultimately even the virtual body count runs into matter and energy limits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But overall, I think we transcend this planet, long before we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reach its carrying capacity (with &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; technology).
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, let's wait and see.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
