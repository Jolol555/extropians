<EM>&gt; That's a good question.  Maybe you could call it the &quot;longevity

<EM>&gt; break-even point&quot;...official life expectancies are calculated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking the death rate at each age TODAY, and combining them.  This tells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you how long person born today would live if, as he aged, he had the same

<EM>&gt; probability of death at each age that a person of that age does today.

<P>Hal!  Your post led me to a most wonderful insight:  the life expectancy
<BR>
tables that most people take for granted and use plan their own lives are
<BR>
based on propaganda by the one industry that profits from our collective
<BR>
pessimism: the insurance company!
<BR>
<P>If State Farm can convince you that you will probably kick it around
<BR>
75, you are far more likely to pay their rates for life insurance!  And
<BR>
keep paying, as 75 comes and goes.
<BR>
<P>Think about this: if currently healthy people assume their own lives
<BR>
will be the same length as those who perish today, then one is using a
<BR>
model wherein technology stops somehow.  This is unimaginably absurd!
<BR>
<P>However, Insurance Incorporated has managed to sell the notion
<BR>
to a gullible public.  No wonder people are resistant to our extropian
<BR>
life-extension memes.  They have been quietly sold a meme package to
<BR>
the contrary by an industry that stands to lose billions, should it
<BR>
become obvious that most of us who purchase life insurance will
<BR>
pay and pay and pay now for a reward that is likely so distant, its
<BR>
current value is a round off error.  spike
