<P>Hello Cynthia,
<BR>
<P>The technology for telemetric monitoring of selected individuals is
<BR>
advancing rapidly.  Sensing those physiological variables known to
<BR>
be associated with, for example, rage and transmitting that data
<BR>
to a data collection and analysis center multiplexed with  GPS-
<BR>
mediated location information could enable preventive intervention
<BR>
in some cases.
<BR>
<P>In a prison setting, convicts with a history of unmanageable rage
<BR>
would normally, in a technologically mature penal facility, be effect-
<BR>
ively isolated at most times, and adequately supervised at others.
<BR>
<P>The individual's self-control of intense rage-states and aggressive
<BR>
episodes could be enhanced by psychotropic medication -- often
<BR>
impulse-control and aggressive personality disorders are associated
<BR>
symptomatically with seizure-like neurological pathology, and our
<BR>
ability to pharmaceutically manage these conditions is advancing
<BR>
rapidly as newer medications of the carbamazepine and zyprexia
<BR>
class are developed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even if we did manage to keep guns out of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands, I doubt it would have much impact on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tendency to rape, rob and murder.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is often assumed that those who advocate the systematic
<BR>
management and regulation of firearm ownership, conditions of
<BR>
permissible use, and licensing believe this step alone is a
<BR>
magical panacea for the rampant interpersonal violence in our
<BR>
society. Of course, IT IS NOT! The management and control
<BR>
of vehicular traffic by signs, signals and speed restrictions does
<BR>
not prevent involuntary homicide and suicide on highways but it
<BR>
helps. There are, actually, marked similarities between the
<BR>
problems society creates for itself by arming and mobilizing the
<BR>
hyperaggressive persons under discussion -- that is why in
<BR>
my original post I suggested that we RESPOND to these threats
<BR>
in similar ways.
<BR>
<P>Please understand that I was a member of the National Rifle
<BR>
Association for years* but became disillusioned with it as it
<BR>
became progressively politicized. But some of their points are
<BR>
persuasive. For example, neither cars nor guns kill people, but
<BR>
they are INSTRUMENTAL in many cases of avoidable mutilation
<BR>
and death.  Domestic homicide, for example, and homicide while
<BR>
committing a felony, are in some cases different phenomena
<BR>
and must be recognized as such by any preventive program.
<BR>
Discrimination here, as everywhere, is needed.
<BR>
<P>Indeed, no social program can prevent and eliminate mans'
<BR>
inhumanity to man.  Where firearms are concerned, we must
<BR>
try to muddle through to an optimal solution of the problems
<BR>
created, not by their use, but by their abuse.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your reply,
<BR>
<P>Bob
