'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  It doesn't take much computational ability to &quot;detect wrongdoing.&quot;  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look at my screen - I see you slit a child's throat - I compute: &quot;Hey that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like wrongdoing.&quot;  And I call the cops.
</EM><BR>
<P>*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
<BR>
thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
<BR>
which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The only
<BR>
way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
<BR>
amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes in,
<BR>
and a hell of a lot of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3.  You are assuming that computational power will make a big difference.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't see why it should.  The database will be searched by the server.  My 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine (the client) will merely display the results.  If the goal is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two-way power proportional transparency the rule should be that the &quot;despot&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have to search the same servers as the lumpen masses.
</EM><BR>
<P>Allow me to fill in a few blanks.  I'm making some assumptions here which
<BR>
you may not be aware of.  Your argument is a lot like an argument raised
<BR>
by David Brin.  You've probably at least heard of him if you've looked
<BR>
around for information on &quot;transparent socity.&quot;  His argument requires
<BR>
that at some point or other, hidden cameras get very cheap and very easy
<BR>
to move around.  This, he argues, will usher in a transparent society, in
<BR>
which it's impossible avoid being monitored whenever somebody feels like
<BR>
it.  He then provides some argument as to why this would be a good thing.
<BR>
<P>Now, I'll assume for the sake of argument that Brin is right that hidden
<BR>
cameras will get extremely cheap and extremely easy to move around.  (He
<BR>
isn't; it's much harder to transmit and receive information like that than
<BR>
he realizes.)  So no one, not even a despot, could prevent you from
<BR>
observing his every move.  One would *still* need to analyze the data, to
<BR>
figure out which screen to look at.
<BR>
<P>Now, you propose that there should be some servers, probably running a
<BR>
&quot;strong AI&quot; which do that analysis, which look at all the screens at once
<BR>
and detect wrongdoing.  People will not be doing this for themselves, we'd
<BR>
imagine, but would have some server do it.  Obviously, individuals would
<BR>
not own their own servers, (otherwise, they'd be doing it themselves,) 
<BR>
so the government would have to provide some public servers to tell the
<BR>
public when and where they need to watch.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps you already see where this is going.  If the government owns those
<BR>
servers, then the government could just as easily switch them off, or,
<BR>
more likely, deny anyone who isn't a member of the elite access to them.  
<BR>
The people can't prevent this, because they don't own the servers, and
<BR>
because they were depending on those servers to know where to look to be
<BR>
able to call the cops.  Without access to the servers, they have all the
<BR>
information they need buried until terabytes of information they don't.
<BR>
And we're back in the position I'd argued we'd be in the first place: a
<BR>
significant divide in terms of the amount of processing power available,
<BR>
and therefore a vastly increased utility for those with power relative to
<BR>
those who don't.
<BR>
<P>In summary.  This system is very useless without a lot of data-crunching,
<BR>
because otherwise, you don't know where to look.  The more data-crunching
<BR>
I can do, the more useful your system is to me.  The more powerful
<BR>
I am, the more data-crunching I can do.  So the more powerful I am, the
<BR>
more useful your system is to me.  So this system helps the powerful more
<BR>
than it helps the weak.
