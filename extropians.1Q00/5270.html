<P>
The consensus of practitioners in the field of anti-aging, including Julian
<BR>
Whitaker, is that HRT ideally should be administered under the supervision
<BR>
of a qualified doctor -- and that not just testosterone, but other hormones
<BR>
too, should be monitored regularly (and supplemented, as appropriate).  HRT
<BR>
seeks not to raise these levels to super-human, off-the-chart numbers, but
<BR>
merely to the levels of a healthy 20- to 30-year-old.
<BR>
<P>Men who have now reached early andropause, and who have been participating in
<BR>
the anti-aging program (including HRT)
<BR>
of a specialist in New York City have seen good results.  In addition to
<BR>
supplemental testosterone (administered through an easy-to-apply
<BR>
transdermal cream), this program includes supplemental human growth hormone
<BR>
(&quot;hGH&quot;), which has dropped significantly in cost from its stratospheric
<BR>
level of several years ago.  Although still not cheap, hGH nevertheless is
<BR>
affordable on my salary as a legal secretary (and it also helps my budget
<BR>
that my medical insurance covers some of the expenses involved in
<BR>
participating in this program, such as lab fees).
<BR>
<P>The field of anti-aging is growing rapidly, with new information being
<BR>
added to the already-existing body of knowledge at an exponential rate.
<BR>
Together with their associates, a few doctors manage to keep up with it all,
<BR>
studying the latest research results and attending conferences (where they
<BR>
may also appear as speakers).  For prospective patients, contact
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I would also suggest that anyone interested in anti-aging read
<BR>
the article &quot;Forever Young,&quot; by Michelle Andrews, in the April 2000 issue
<BR>
of SMART MONEY Magazine -- now available on newsstands (or in your local
<BR>
library).  In addition to reviewing the benefits of HRT, the article quotes
<BR>
some of its critics -- and also features quotes from Dr. Livesey as well as
<BR>
several of his patients.
