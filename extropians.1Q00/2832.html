<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; only seem to be a &quot;rip-off&quot; because you grew up in a culture where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  legislators _defined_ derivative art as &quot;theft&quot;.  They did such a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  job of propagandizing this idea that it seems &quot;natural&quot;  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey watch it. For years artist were totally unprotected by laws that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protected every other practise. Now we are at*least* in the position of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having the OPPORTUNITY to sue people who steal from art and pretend it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theirs to sell.
</EM><BR>
<P>See?  You made my point: your mind is warped by the rhetoric of IP
<BR>
law.  Recast that sentence to say the same thing from the other point
<BR>
of view: &quot;For years artists did not enjoy the monopoly privilege
<BR>
granted to some other practices...now at least they have lobbied for
<BR>
those grants and can be as litigious as the rest.&quot;  And the &quot;pretend
<BR>
it's theirs to sell&quot; comment is disingenuous: you know as well as I
<BR>
do that copyright prevents them from selling it even when they freely
<BR>
acknowledge where it came from.  
<BR>
<P>The very concept that ideas can be &quot;mine&quot; or &quot;yours&quot; is bizarre,
<BR>
unnatural, and recent.  And contrary to your assertion, it did _not_
<BR>
apply to everyone but recording artists--it still doesn't, for
<BR>
example, apply to mathematicians who may labor for years on a proof
<BR>
and do not claim ownership of it.  It does not apply, for example,
<BR>
to the shapes of letters in a font design--those are public domain
<BR>
and may be implemented by anyone (though the _name_ of a font can
<BR>
be a protected trademark).  It does not apply to collections of data
<BR>
that may have taken years of research to collect if there is no
<BR>
particular creative expression in them (phone books, for example,
<BR>
can be copied and sold routinely).
