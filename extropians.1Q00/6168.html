<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330005751.92707.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This is *excessively* naive.  How could you know if data was important 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;not without analzying it?  Important information doesn't come 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;color-coded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;in red, you know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, the technology is not yet in place so I do have difficulty 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;describing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it with minute particularity, but:  You could set your own parameters.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; instance my preferences list will say something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Notify me whenever:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (1) someone accesses any of my banking data;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (2) one of my listed sworn enemies (a) purchases a weapon (b) comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 200 yards of my person (c) comes within two blocks of my house (d) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any of my data or (e) speaks my name; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (3) anyone is watching me by remote surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This might not seem like a lot of work, but we don't have a computer today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's capable of detecting anything you list in (2) without a human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pre-analyzing the data.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never said the system should or could be implemented &quot;today.&quot;  AI could 
<BR>
very well solve this problem.  Even so, I don't think it would really be 
<BR>
that difficult to solve even with today's technology.  My list of sworn 
<BR>
enemies would be finite (quite small actually).  You could do it with sets 
<BR>
of software agents.  One agent assigned to follow each of the enemies on my 
<BR>
list.  When any one enemy did one of the trigger events, the agent merely 
<BR>
reports back.  Would that really be so difficult to engineer?  I don't think 
<BR>
so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now keep in mind that even if we did, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer would have to be checking millions of different screens all at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;once, and you can see that this project does, indeed, require quite a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of computational power.  Without it, having access to the feeds is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem is that you are thinking of the system as &quot;the 
<BR>
computer.&quot;  Sure it would have to be one *massively* parallel box to handle 
<BR>
all those requests and all that data.  But guess what?  Coming soon to a 
<BR>
planet under you will be a distributed network of intelligent devices of all 
<BR>
kinds.  Think intelligent, networked, and communicating observation and 
<BR>
reporting hardware devices, think innumerable software agents all reporting 
<BR>
back to you according to your instructions, think distributed networked 
<BR>
computing, think &quot;system&quot; as opposed to &quot;the computer&quot; and it should be 
<BR>
easier to grasp.
