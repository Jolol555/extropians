<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm replying to my own reply, since it suddenly occured to me that tensile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  strength per unit density is exactly the WRONG units to use. This would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cause us to use (for example) a 1km thick strand of steel foam in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; preference to a 1m thick strand of solid steel, because they had similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tensile strengths, but one was much less dense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I beg to differ, Stirling.  The steel foam would lose tensile strength in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proportion to its density.  Since it doesnt matter the volume of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space cable, there is no preference between steel and aluminum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for instance.  Aluminum is approximately a third the density of steel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but its tensile strength is also about a third.  I shall wait to post this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until I see if Doug Jones has already jumped on this.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm little slow on the uptake tonight, but I looked up the specific
<BR>
strengths entry in a materials handbook today- to my (not so great)
<BR>
surprise, it's listed as a characteristic length, due to a factor of g
<BR>
being thrown in.  Listed in kilometers, it's the length of an untapered
<BR>
filament that could support itself in a mythical one gee field.  The
<BR>
number I recall seeing for graphite was around 100 km.
<BR>
<P>With v^2 divided by m/s^2, the units drop out to meters.  Every bit as
<BR>
perverse as quoting Isp in seconds... yet another legacy of American
<BR>
Provincial units.
<BR>
<P>Sigh.
