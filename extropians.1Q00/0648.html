Esteemed Extropians,
<BR>
<P>In reaction to the slightly annoying :-) (and in spite of our Extropian 
<BR>
'Dynamic Optimism' to me somewhat surprising) degree to which many people on 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;H and Extropian mailing lists persist in exhibiting what I can only call 
</EM><BR>
(techno-)pessimism and defaitism (see e.g. the threads 'extropian enemies 
<BR>
lists', 'Debate Failure', and 'Opposition to Transhumanism' on this mailing 
<BR>
list very recently), I want to posit the following thesis: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;''Dynamic Optimism'' can be lifted a little in status, namely:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from merely a method of LIVING more efficiently and more agreeably, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;can lift it to a method of *THINKING*, i.e., of logical reasoning,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;comparable to the Scientific Method(+).  
<BR>
<P>In Max More's essay on Dynamic Optimism (<A HREF="http://www.maxmore.com/optimism.htm">http://www.maxmore.com/optimism.htm</A>),
<BR>
Dynamic Optimism is mainly presented as a way to organize one's own life more 
<BR>
efficiently, in order so as to spare oneself frustration and so as to get more 
<BR>
useful work done. 
<BR>
<P>I think I can prove the fact that Dynamic Optimism can also be viewed as a 
<BR>
method of logical THINKING that can be used very profitably and perfectly 
<BR>
legitimately as a tool for reasoning, in a similar way as the Scientific 
<BR>
Method.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Briefly: Each hypothesis A that clashes with Dynamic Optimism is not useful 
<BR>
to an individual believing in hypothesis A, in a similar way as each 
<BR>
hypothesis B clashing with the Scientific Method is not useful to an 
<BR>
individual believing in hypothesis B.  Hypothesis A is therefore 'false' in 
<BR>
the same way, and for the same reasons, as hypothesis B is 'false'.) 
<BR>
<P>Promoting Dynamic Optimism in this way into a (formal) tool of logical 
<BR>
reasoning (where previously it was something between an informal rule-of-thumb 
<BR>
and a lifestyle) makes that one can make use of it in more ways, and above all 
<BR>
in *more direct* ways.  It enables one to conclude in a very *direct* way that 
<BR>
alarmism and defaitism, apart from being useless, annoying, and 
<BR>
frustrating (though nevertheless much loved by some people), are also 
<BR>
(even) logically 'false'.  (Where the word 'false' is used in exactly the same 
<BR>
way as when used in connection with the Scientific Method.)  The reasoning 
<BR>
goes like this: is the theory obviously pessimistic (= non-Dynamically-
<BR>
Optimistic) ?  For example, does the theory say that whatever you do, things 
<BR>
will go wrong ? or that something is incapable of being modified by one's own 
<BR>
efforts into something more useful to oneself ?  If yes, then we can conclude 
<BR>
directly that the theory is false. 
<BR>
<P><P>Best Greetings,   Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Dynamic%20Optimism%20as%20a%20tool%20in%20logical%20reasoning&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000113042430.686A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>; <A HREF="http://www.rubinghscience.org/">http://www.rubinghscience.org/</A>)

(+) The 'Scientific Method', or the 'Method of Scientific Thinking', is as 
follows: (1) Think rationally, i.e., logically; and (2) Do not believe 
anything without ''proof''.  (The 2nd element is the hardest part.)  (The 
because of its interesting-sounding name so well-known ''Occam's Razor'' is 
really only a sub-component of this 2nd element of the Scientific Method, 
making some aspects about things regarded as valid 'proof' more precise.)
