<EM>&gt; &gt; Conclusion:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; These people are deliberately avoiding all mention of diamondoid and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drextech.  I'm not sure whether they're good guys or bad guys, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't trust them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by ignorance.

<P>The figure of merit for researchers is citations.  Workers and papers
<BR>
which are widely cited are by definition the most influential.  They are
<BR>
the ones which get the prestige and the credit.
<BR>
<P>I think it is fair to say that Drexler's work does not have much direct
<BR>
connection to current research in nanotech.  He got some credit (and
<BR>
citations) for his proposal that the protein folding problem might be
<BR>
easier to solve for engineered proteins.  But his visions in Engines
<BR>
and Nanosystems simply don't lend themselves to research that can be
<BR>
done in the labs today.
<BR>
<P>He is more of a visionary, an evangelist.  He points the way to the
<BR>
promised land.  But the people who will get the credit are those who do
<BR>
the work that brings us there.
<BR>
<P>It's ironic, but it is entirely possible that in the end we will come to
<BR>
a fully nanotech future, every bit as amazing as what Drexler envisions
<BR>
- and he will be a forgotten figure.  None of the credit will be his.
<BR>
He will be like a Jules Verne or H.G. Wells, a visionary who caught
<BR>
a glimpse of the future but doesn't get credit because he didn't do
<BR>
the work.  At best he might be a Leonardo, years ahead of his time,
<BR>
but not considered the actual inventor of the technology he foresaw.
<BR>
<P>The Leonardo comparison is probably a good one, because I suspect that
<BR>
by the time nanotech assembly systems are built, they will bear the
<BR>
same resemblance to Drexler's quaint designs that our own airplanes do
<BR>
to Leonardo's plans for flying machines.
