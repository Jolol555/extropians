<P><P><P><P>Telomerase Prevents Onset of Liver
<BR>
Cirrhosis in Mice
<BR>
<P>MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BW HealthWire)--Feb. 17, 2000--Geron Corporation
<BR>
(Nasdaq: GERN
<BR>
- news) reported the publication of independent scientific research that
<BR>
supports the potential role of
<BR>
telomerase as a therapeutic agent in liver cirrhosis. The research,
<BR>
performed by scientists at the
<BR>
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School and Albert Einstein
<BR>
College of Medicine
<BR>
and published in the February 18 issue of Science, provides evidence of the
<BR>
efficacy of telomerase
<BR>
therapy in a mouse model of cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease.
<BR>
<P>Geron provided funding for development of the original telomerase knock-out
<BR>
mouse which led to
<BR>
this study, and has exclusive intellectual property rights to key human
<BR>
telomerase assays, proteins
<BR>
and genes, as well as therapeutic applications of these molecules.
<BR>
<P>Telomerase is an enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA at the ends of
<BR>
chromosomes and thereby
<BR>
confers extended replicative capacity to cells. In the absence of
<BR>
telomerase, telomeres gradually
<BR>
shorten until a critical limit is reached and cells stop dividing and either
<BR>
die or senesce. Numerous in
<BR>
vitro and in vivo studies have established a strong correlation between
<BR>
telomere erosion and cellular
<BR>
aging and disease, but this report is the first published evidence that
<BR>
introduction of telomerase by
<BR>
gene therapy in an animal model prevents the onset of a serious chronic
<BR>
disease. Liver cirrhosis in
<BR>
humans is typically caused by hepatitis or chronic exposure to alcohol, and
<BR>
is the seventh leading
<BR>
cause of death by disease. There is currently no adequate treatment.
<BR>
<P>In previous work led by the senior author of this study, Dr. Ron DePinho, it
<BR>
was shown that although
<BR>
mice normally have very long telomeres, short telomeres could be achieved by
<BR>
eliminating the gene
<BR>
for one of the components of mouse telomerase. Eventually, critically short
<BR>
telomeres are reached
<BR>
and the mice display several age-related disorders similar to those seen in
<BR>
elderly humans, including:
<BR>
an increase in hair graying and loss, ulcerative skin lesions, chromosomal
<BR>
fusions and cancer; and a
<BR>
decrease in body weight and lifespan. The mice also showed a decreased
<BR>
ability to recover from
<BR>
stress which resulted in a decreased regenerative capacity of hematopoietic
<BR>
(blood) and
<BR>
gastrointestinal systems, including the liver, as well as a decreased wound
<BR>
healing capability.
<BR>
<P>In previous experiments, in three separate disease models of chronic stress
<BR>
to the liver, mice with
<BR>
short telomeres were shown to have impaired capacity to recover from such
<BR>
stress compared to
<BR>
mice with long telomeres. DePinho's team has now demonstrated that when DNA
<BR>
for the telomerase
<BR>
gene is delivered by gene therapy to the telomerase knock-out mice, the mice
<BR>
become equally
<BR>
capable of recovery following liver stress as are normal young mice with
<BR>
long telomeres.
<BR>
<P>``This study is important for two fundamental reasons,'' noted Calvin B.
<BR>
Harley, Ph.D., Geron's chief
<BR>
scientific officer and a pioneer in telomere and telomerase biology.
<BR>
``First, it shows telomere loss can
<BR>
be the key factor in chronic age-related diseases. In this in vivo model,
<BR>
the only difference between
<BR>
the experimental mice and the control mice is the lack of telomerase which
<BR>
results in significant
<BR>
telomere loss. This difference generates disease conditions similar to that
<BR>
seen in humans. Second, by
<BR>
showing that telomerase gene therapy can prevent cirrhosis in these mice, it
<BR>
provides a model system
<BR>
to test the safety and efficacy of telomerase therapy in humans, not just
<BR>
for liver disease, but for
<BR>
multiple other disorders in which telomere loss is implicated.''
<BR>
<P>In DePinho's studies, the gene for the RNA component of mouse telomerase
<BR>
(mTR) was first
<BR>
genetically deleted, and then, later, delivered by gene therapy just before
<BR>
telomeres became critically
<BR>
short. In humans, the natural repression of telomerase activity in cells is
<BR>
largely controlled by turning
<BR>
off the gene for the catalytic protein component of telomerase (hTERT).
<BR>
Geron scientists cloned the
<BR>
hTERT gene in 1997 in collaboration with researchers at the University of
<BR>
Colorado, Boulder.
<BR>
Subsequently, in collaboration with investigators at the University of Texas
<BR>
Southwestern Medical
<BR>
School at Dallas, Geron scientists showed that hTERT alone was sufficient to
<BR>
extend the healthy
<BR>
lifespan of numerous cell types, without inducing cancerous changes in the
<BR>
cells (Bodnar, et al 1998,
<BR>
Science 279:349-352; Jiang, et al 1999, Nature Genetics 21:111-114). These
<BR>
discoveries have
<BR>
opened the door for the development of therapeutics to treat numerous
<BR>
degenerative diseases of
<BR>
aging by cell, gene, protein, or small molecule (drug-like) therapies that
<BR>
result in telomerase
<BR>
activation.
<BR>
<P>Geron has an extensive intellectual property portfolio of more than 40
<BR>
issued patents and numerous
<BR>
pending patent applications covering telomerase, including the mouse model
<BR>
used in these recent
<BR>
studies. Geron's patent portfolio includes patents and applications covering
<BR>
both the RNA and
<BR>
protein components of human telomerase, the genes encoding these human
<BR>
molecules, and methods
<BR>
of modulating cell function by administering these molecules to cells.
<BR>
<P>Geron Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on discovering,
<BR>
developing and
<BR>
commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products to treat cancer and
<BR>
