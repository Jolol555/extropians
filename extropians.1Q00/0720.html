<P><EM>&gt; There are psychological studies [...] showing that pessimistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people perform better than those who call themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimists in some tasks (among them being certain branches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of science).  [...] I think there is a strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link between criticism and pessimism. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that pessimism is probably a better tool to achieve *some* tasks such 
<BR>
as citicizing (where 'criticizing' is used in the meaning of 'uncovering the 
<BR>
downsides of things').  Immediately, I conjecture that these tasks in which 
<BR>
pessimists are more successful are exactly those tasks that diminish the 
<BR>
health and growth rate of the individual executing these tasks -- i.e., that 
<BR>
these tasks are self-debilitating.  I claim that those activities for which 
<BR>
pessimism is a better tool are also always precisely those activities that do 
<BR>
not lead to success (= improvement of strength, health etc.) for the person 
<BR>
carrying out the activity. 
<BR>
<P>Criticizing is only done by a (rational) optimist when the criticism opens up 
<BR>
more positive vistas than it closes down. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It would be fine to develop a kind of optimism that is equally critical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without the downsides of pessimism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, try out Max More's ''Dynamic Optimism''.  Wouldn't that be just what we 
<BR>
seek ? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some might be more inclined to making hypotheses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others may prefer criticizing and disproving them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, this implies a symbiosis between (I) optimists creating hypotheses; and 
<BR>
(II) pessimists breaking the hypotheses down.  But, in this symbiosis, the 
<BR>
party II will be compelled (by evolutionary/free-market forces) not to waste 
<BR>
time on uselessly large amounts or uselessly 'black' kinds of criticism.  A 
<BR>
worker in party II who through his criticism can immediately indicate ways for 
<BR>
how to improve the thing criticized, will have a selection advantage. 
<BR>
<P>Also, the party I in this symbiosis needs party II less than vice versa.  
<BR>
Party I can get along by substituting for party II the action of just going 
<BR>
out and trying out their hypotheses in practice.  In contrast, party II can 
<BR>
not do without party I -- a society consisting only of party II will never 
<BR>
create anything new. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So [...] it seems to me that optimism is well suited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for technologists, but not necessarily for scientists. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Look at science as a technology producing scientific theories as its 
<BR>
technological products.  It's only necessary to construct *one* working sample 
<BR>
(version) of a theory -- out of a whole universe of possible theories --, and 
<BR>
it only has to be a theory that works *approximately* in most cases (i.e., 
<BR>
that yields acceptable predictions), and/or that is only slightly better than 
<BR>
older the version of a theory in the same field, and it only has to be a 
<BR>
theory applicable in one small field.  Also, the theory doesn't have to 
<BR>
pretend to be unimprovable, or to be 'final' any other way.  Just discover an 
<BR>
ugly add-on to an existing theory that makes the theory fit more snugly to 
<BR>
some new measurements, call your add-on the ''X''-effect (substitute your own 
<BR>
name for X), and ready ! you've constructed another new and very useful piece 
<BR>
of science.  Then go construct a theory generalizing two of these ugly 'ad 
<BR>
hoc' theories (which is an activity that doesn't require any new evidence) -- 
<BR>
and again you've done it, again you've produced a new bit of science. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bartley describes this as one possible metacontext and lists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two others: [...]
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, you convinced me to really go read Bartley !  But I propose yet 
<BR>
another metacontext, and one in which both Pancritical Rationalism and my
<BR>
'D.O. logic' survive: namely, the context formed by chucking out all 
<BR>
moralism and by equating 'good' and 'true' with 'egoistically useful'. 
<BR>
That is, the only 'good' is that which supports life.  Life is equated 
<BR>
with 'good'.  Anything that survives and/or thrives is thereby 'good' -- the 
<BR>
very fact that it continues to survive is taken as the reason for
<BR>
labelling it with the judgment 'good'.  Anything that does not survive is
<BR>
always automatically 'wrong' and 'bad' by the very fact of non-survival.  A 
<BR>
theory that leads to non-survival or non-growth is 'bad' and 'false' by the 
<BR>
very fact that it doesn't lead to growth or survival.  In this 
<BR>
metacontext, one looks for new scientific theories not in order to
<BR>
improve the world, but in order to find more tools which help you to
<BR>
egoistically survive and grow more effectively.
<BR>
<P>Arrivederci !,       Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Dynamic%20Optimism%20as%20a%20tool%20in%20logical%20reasoning&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000114233650.2233A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)

PS:
&gt; (And I'm still grateful for that copy of ch. 7 of
&gt; &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; that you gave me in Weesp :)
Very welcome !  That book is quite successful in using a portion of my 
resources as its replicator mechanism. :-)
