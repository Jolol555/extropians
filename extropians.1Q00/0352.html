<P>&quot;[2] As a question for the Legal Department: Suppose &quot;Extropianism&quot;
<BR>
were redefined as a &quot;religion&quot;; what protections and advantages would
<BR>
this afford (at the price of some hypocrisy and double-think)?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I know the reason I have not been contacted by the Legal Department
<BR>
is their discouragement over the apparent difficulty of such a task. Well,
<BR>
to liberate your energies I am revealing my amazingly simple secret steps
<BR>
to &quot;rolling your own&quot; religion.  It is a ridiculously easy process of rummag-
<BR>
ing about for twelve -- yes &quot;12&quot; -- items which you either already have
<BR>
or can inexpensively purchase from local suppliers.  Here is your shopping
<BR>
list; look it over quickly to become convinced that ANYONE CAN DO THIS
<BR>
and therefore you can too.
<BR>
<P>[01] A Suprahuman Ancestor
<BR>
<P>[02] At least one Sacred Text
<BR>
<P>[03] Several Magical Procedures
<BR>
<P>[04] A Sacred Talisman and Logo
<BR>
<P>[05] A Sacred Grove, Edifice or Website
<BR>
<P>[06] A Hierophantic Language
<BR>
<P>[07] A Charismatic Spokesperson for [01]
<BR>
<P>[08] A Rationale for Financial Support of [07]
<BR>
<P>[09] A Remedy for Pain and Death
<BR>
<P>[10] Some measure of Financial and Legal Immunity
<BR>
<P>[11] A Sacred Rulebook as a basis for [09]
<BR>
<P>[12] A  System of Indoctrination
