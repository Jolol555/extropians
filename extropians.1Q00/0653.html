<P><EM>&gt; I seem to be laboring under the impression that Western civilization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does less damage to the environment, per capita, than your average Third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World country.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps true, but we are constraining ourselves under environmental
<BR>
regulations to deal with the problem of stealing from the commons.
<BR>
Once we got to the stage where our industry/agriculture etc. were
<BR>
causing &quot;serious&quot; negative health impacts, the political forces
<BR>
started to drive back the pollution &amp; waste of resources.
<BR>
<P>In contrast, countries like Russia or perhaps India and some
<BR>
African nations, where there is a lot of land per capita, you have
<BR>
a lot of room to pollute into before the back-pressures become
<BR>
significant.  There are many areas in Russia that are environmental
<BR>
disaster areas.  If you have high population concentrations, e.g.
<BR>
Mexico City, the back pressures get stronger much sooner.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, I can't remember where I got that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impression from.  I recall that Western farming is much more efficient,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requiring less land for more output;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, this gets done by providing more secondary inputs, e.g. fertilizer
<BR>
for agriculture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recall that the massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forest-clearing needed to produce Third World farmland is not good for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ecology; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True in tropical countries, where the topsoil is thin and easily washed
<BR>
away in the tropical rains.  At that point you have depleted the nutrient
<BR>
base that it took many thousansds of years to build up and must resort
<BR>
to applying secondary inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, etc.) to getting
<BR>
any kind of yield.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and I recall that poorer countries have much higher rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of population growth.  However, I still don't know what the actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figures are for actual &quot;damage&quot; to the environment with respect to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Western civilization and Third World countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would depend alot on what &quot;class&quot; of environmental degradation you
<BR>
are talking about: air (low except in cities or when considered on a
<BR>
global basis), water (high in cities, less high but significant in
<BR>
agricultural regions), toxic contamination (high near refineries,
<BR>
mining, smelting operations), etc.
<BR>
<P><P>There was, I believe a recent article, perhaps in Science about the
<BR>
problems that the use of coal is causing in reduced agricultural
<BR>
productivity in China (due to diminished light availability).
<BR>
So we are getting to the point where the third world countries
<BR>
are becoming aware of the negative feedback caused by environmental
<BR>
degradation.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm looking for figures on things like pollution produced and waste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produced, not, say, energy consumption.  Presumably you can consume ten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times as much energy for a tenth of the environmental cost if you use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nuclear energy instead of burning wooden logs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends whether &amp; how you factor in the costs of mining the uranium,
<BR>
storing the radioactive wastes, vs. planting more trees to absorb
<BR>
the excess CO2.  These apples and oranges comparisons are hard to do.
<BR>
<P>Sorry, I can't give you more than that, but I'm in an information
<BR>
impoverished personal environment currently.  I'd say a good place
<BR>
to start would be a typical &quot;annual&quot; almanac.  You can get country
<BR>
productivity figures from that and probably make estimates as to
<BR>
the environmental damage that results.
