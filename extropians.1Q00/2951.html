<EM>&gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people
</EM><BR>
promoting the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere
</EM><BR>
despite the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place due to
</EM><BR>
it's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity?
</EM><BR>
<P>It would still take a long time for the atmosphere to seep away and one
<BR>
could always continue to replenish it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't get me wrong I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us to go there and I feel we could live there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  I don't want to spend time near so much gravity.:)  I would prefer a
<BR>
free floating existence -- or one inside a hollowed out asteroid.  Either
<BR>
way, I'd prefer to roam over staying on some world for thousands of years or
<BR>
more.  I've already been there, done that, but I didn't get a tee shirt for
<BR>
it.:)
<BR>
<P>It's kind of cute how a lot of people want to move into space only to
<BR>
recreate Earth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe, though, we can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live there under a man made roof to hold in the atmosphere. I asked R.

Zubrin
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this question. All he said was go read his book. Geez, was a straight
</EM><BR>
answer so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult? Perhaps he's only in it for the money as he was more interested
</EM><BR>
in my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; buying his book than answering a question that couldn't have taken but a
</EM><BR>
few
<BR>
<EM>&gt; words.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't read his book either.  Maybe he just didn't want to rehearse all
<BR>
his arguments.  Also, maybe he _is_ trying to make money.  I don't see much
<BR>
wrong with that.  That's probably one reason why he wrote his book.  &quot;Those
<BR>
limos aren't free, you know?&quot;:)
<BR>
<P>You can read my essay on space colonization at my site.  It's probably not a
<BR>
tenth as good as Zubrin's book -- heck, it's much, much shorter -- but it's
<BR>
only a few mouse-clicks away.:)
