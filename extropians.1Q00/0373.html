<P>Harvey, I'm not sure you aren't stretching over the edge here.  There is
<BR>
a *big* difference between *telling* someone how to build a nuclear weapon
<BR>
and committing an act of terrorism with one!  Now, this opens a very
<BR>
interesting area, regarding technologies to build weapons.  An old quote
<BR>
in Xenology (by Freitas) that I'm working on says it is a violation of
<BR>
U.S. Law to disclose information that could be used to build nuclear weapons.
<BR>
But this would appear that this would be a violation of the right of free speech.
<BR>
The courts have recently sided with the individual on this with regard to
<BR>
encryption technology distribution.
<BR>
<P>Now, going back a few years there was a Ph.D. thesis by an individual at
<BR>
Princeton that pretty much spilled the beans on the construction of nuclear
<BR>
weapons.  Does anyone know how that played out in the freedom of speech
<BR>
courts?
<BR>
<P>Mind you, while I'm highly sensitive to people &quot;tapping&quot; my phones,
<BR>
I'm also very sensitive to the Federal Government restricting the
<BR>
distribution of technologies.  So long as a technology may have
<BR>
multiple uses, you can only act in a violation of the law (a
<BR>
violation of privacy) -- not on a &quot;potential&quot; violation of privacy!
<BR>
<P>If Linda Tripp violated the wire-tapping laws, she deserves to get
<BR>
burnt.  At the same time the government has no business restricting
<BR>
technologies that allow people to violate those laws (as long as they
<BR>
have other non-law breaking uses).  It is the *act* which counts, not
<BR>
the *potential* for an act.
