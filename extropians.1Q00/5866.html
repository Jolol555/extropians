<P><EM>&gt;Another project is to create one or more widely-accessible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;low-transaction-cost web sites allowing general betting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lots of betting on technology questions is the best way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know to improve how we learn about new technologies;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;betting markets help us share and combine info in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that other social institutions just can not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Technology questions for what outcome?  If a plan or option is created with
<BR>
regard to technologies' probable consequence, there must be an outcome of
<BR>
something -- communication, transportion, life extension.
<BR>
<P>Now, I realize that we agree on the importance of technologies for the
<BR>
purpose of extreme life extension, we may not agree on which ones to
<BR>
promote.  Whereas I think the one most important use of philanthropic money
<BR>
would be to *increase the well being of humankind*  by designing parallel
<BR>
programs in science and technology to overcome death and disease, you are
<BR>
not convinced that all methods are promising options. You do agree with me
<BR>
that cryonics and uploading are part of extreme life extension and viable
<BR>
investments.  
<BR>
<P>In my view of extreme life extension (superlongevity), technology is the
<BR>
course fueled by &quot;creative&quot; innovations and I think a pretty sure bet. For
<BR>
example, I wouldn't bet (purchase stock)  in Celera if I didn't carefully
<BR>
research whether is a top dog and first-mover in an important, emerging
<BR>
industry; has sustainable advantage gained through business momentum,
<BR>
patent protection, visionaries, or inept competitors; has demonstrated
<BR>
strong past share appreciation; good management and smart financial
<BR>
backing; and has strong consumer appeal.
<BR>
<P>I think extreme life extension (based on technological and scientific
<BR>
advances spurred by creative innovations) is a good bet whether a tangible
<BR>
product or an idea future.
<BR>
<P>I agree with you that social institutions fall short in fast learning and
<BR>
participation.  One of the most widely publicized shared information
<BR>
markets today is genomics, as evidenced by the mercurial nature of the
<BR>
stock market -- which continues to move upward regardless of its falls.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yet another project is to explore the vast untouched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;space of possible forms of government.  Because democracy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems better than monarchy, people seem to have concluded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that current forms of democracy are the best there is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, we have barely dipped our toe into the ocean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of possible forms of government.  (For an example of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a very different possible form, as me about &quot;futarchy.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Please expand on futarchy Robin.  Correct me if I am broadening the
<BR>
blueprint on futarchy, but it seems to me that a furarchy would include
<BR>
encouraging and supporting projects that aim to please people who want to
<BR>
develop the technologies that will extend life immeasurably.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The big projects I think of as a waste are most space,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;medicine, and education, and parenting projects. 
</EM><BR>
<P>As sub-projects, I think that endeavors that bring humankind a lot of
<BR>
enthusiasm and enjoyment could certainly benefit humankind in enormous
<BR>
ways.  The sheer thrill of space exploration build our human esteem, and
<BR>
the arts influences culture more than any other area of knowledge and
<BR>
learning. If medicine includes the sciences and technologies that keeps
<BR>
someone from dying, I do not think it a waste.  Medicine functions as a
<BR>
safety net to keep us alive and kicking.  For more further out concepts
<BR>
about extreme longevity, medicine helps us get there.
