<EM>&gt; So - how about the Revolution Foundation?  A well-funded group develops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both a business plan - and an invasion plan - for a target country.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ineffective leadership is forced out in one way or another.  The group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes in with sufficient resources (mostly trained staff, this isn't to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be another throw-money-away venture) to build up needed institutions -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; courts, schools, etc.  Our favorite sort of minimal-interference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market-respecting government is instituted.  It doesn't have to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democratic, day one likely it can't be.  &gt;Now&lt; buy the land. Sit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back and wait.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's thinking outside the box, Rob, I'll grant you that...
<BR>
<P>Part of the problem is that there is a reason why those governments are
<BR>
so bad.  They are in a position to enrich themselves, and few people
<BR>
have the willpower to resist such temptation.  You might not have such
<BR>
an easy time installing your favorite sort of government, without them
<BR>
succumbing to the lures of easy wealth.
<BR>
<P>There's also the question of whether the indiginous population would
<BR>
welcome the reinstatement of imperialist external rule.  Most of those
<BR>
countries worked hard to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism.
<BR>
Economically many countries are worse off, but it would be a terrible
<BR>
blow to their pride to ask for the hated rulers to come back in and
<BR>
start running things again.
