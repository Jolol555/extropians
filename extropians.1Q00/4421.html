<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corel and Intel discuss alliance
<BR>
In talks with computer maker to launch cheap line of
<BR>
PCs that would challenge Microsoft's dominance
<BR>

Technology Reporter
<BR>
Thursday, March 9, 2000
<BR>
<P><P>Ottawa -- Corel Corp. is in talks with Intel Corp. and at least one
<BR>
major computer maker to launch a line of cheap personal computers that
<BR>
takes direct aim at Microsoft Corp.'s near-monopoly in desktop PC
<BR>
operating systems.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There are lots of discussions under way,&quot; Corel head Michael Cowpland
<BR>
told The Globe and Mail yesterday, just before the start of the Ottawa
<BR>
software maker's annual general  meeting. &quot;We've been talking for
<BR>
months.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Mr. Cowpland said the talks are &quot;multifaceted&quot; and involve other
<BR>
computer industry players. Although he wouldn't reveal further details,
<BR>
Corel and Santa Clara, Calif.-based  Intel would likely also want to
<BR>
include a computer maker, a browser company and an  Internet service
<BR>
provider. &quot;There's a huge amount of action.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Under the deal being discussed, Corel will supply its Linux operating
<BR>
system, a cheap and reliable alternative to Microsoft's dominant Windows
<BR>
software. There are no details on what the hardware component of the
<BR>
computer would be, but Intel markets a line of low-cost microprocessors
<BR>
called Celeron.
<BR>
<P>Doug Cooper, a spokesman for Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, said the
<BR>
two companies have been working together for &quot;quite some time,&quot; but that
<BR>
the key relationship in the arrangement would involve Corel and a
<BR>
computer maker. &quot;We want to ensure that the mainstream software works
<BR>
best with Intel chips.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A definitive deal would be a technology industry landmark because it
<BR>
would mark a new path for Intel, which has made its name -- and its vast
<BR>
fortune -- largely on the back of its  lucrative relationship with
<BR>
Microsoft. The two giants have dominated their respective areas  of the
<BR>
PC industry through a partnership commonly known as &quot;Wintel.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But Mr. Cooper said Intel believes in choice. &quot;It's certainly good news
<BR>
for consumers,&quot; he said of the talks.
<BR>
<P>There is no indication that Intel plans to sever or scale back its
<BR>
relationship with Microsoft of Redmond, Wash.
<BR>
<P>For Corel, a deal would mark its latest -- and easily most important --
<BR>
step in the company's strategy of increasing its user base by bundling
<BR>
low-cost versions of its software with the major players in other
<BR>
corners of the PC industry.
<BR>
<P>But a deal would also mark a return to a head-on confrontation with
<BR>
Microsoft, a strategy that sent Corel into a tailspin in the mid-1990s
<BR>
as it attacked the software giant's  entrenched position in the office
<BR>
software market.
