<EM>&gt;I really enjoy being on this list.  I have learned alot and made some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friends in the bargain.  I am surprised there are not more people on it.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still feel a little like a &quot;pioneer&quot; by being here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe you *are* a pioneer.  I am sure that in 20-30 years when the 
<BR>
viability of strong AI and nanotech start to become evident to the world at 
<BR>
large, folks will look back to the archived writings and web pages of some 
<BR>
of the people on this list and say &quot;hey, those freaks were right all along!&quot;
