<EM>&gt;  Are they those weird lying-down bikes that get stuck in the tread of

<EM>&gt;  semi-trailers?

<P>ahem.

<P><P>I hardly EVER run over bikes.

<P>Thanks to Spike's earlier post however i have been giving recumbents (known 
<BR>
as &quot;bents&quot;?) some little thought.  Currently I'm tending toward the three 
<BR>
wheeler version....two front one rear.  For some reason I've always been 
<BR>
enamoured by that configuration .
<BR>
<P>The idea of a three wheeler with electric assist is interesting..
