<P><EM>&gt;I get the impression there's some wonderment as to why I'm raising the issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While I understand that the ordinary way of doing things is to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arguments on every possible side of an issue, multiple organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with conflicting goals - a situation that some may even associate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things like &quot;the free exchange of ideas&quot; - I thought I should take at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least a shot at doing what a transhuman would do in this situation; get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a complete consensus by everyone on the correct course of action.  I may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be a transhuman, but we're all supposedly rational people here, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it does seem to me that our choices here are not a matter of decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but of perception.  There is one unambiguous set of correct actions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;under all three major supergoals, and I want to at least take a shot at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;getting a consensus on that by all major Extropians and organizations.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i understand, and dig, for whatever that's worth.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, i'm not trying to get a consensus... i'm trying to persuade or be
<BR>
persuaded. who needs consensi, (is that right?) anyway? aw well. thats
<BR>
beside the point, i suppose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In particular, my argument is that the probability of a Sysop Mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working is at least 30%, while the probability of uploading working for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any given person in the absence of a Sysop, even given the technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is no more than 0.1%.  den Otter and sayke have had a lot to say about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this, about the glory of individuality and the evil of Big Brother and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their reluctance to give up control, but none of it seems to address the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basic fact that 30% is more than 0.1%.  If you open up box A, you have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;30% chance of survival.  If you open up box B, you have a 0.1% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survival.  Those are the facts.  Everything else is just a side effect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a context-dependent heuristic.  Forget the instincts.  Forget the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emotions.  Forget the social algorithms.  Think like an AI.  Which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more:  0.3 or 0.001?  That's it.  That's all.  Everything else is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irrelevant.  You don't need to look inside those black boxes to see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answer.  You just need to know the numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nice numbers, but i disagree with them. i think that the probability of
<BR>
uploading working for me, in the absence of a Sysop, and given the
<BR>
technology, is somewhere in the ballpark of 70%. and, i think that the
<BR>
probability of a Sysop Mind working is no more then 0.1%.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i pulled my numbers outa my ass. where didja get yours?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyway, that might be beside the point, because i don't think a sysop is
<BR>
doable. your welcome to convince me, though, of course.
