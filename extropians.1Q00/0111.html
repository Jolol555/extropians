<P>This is an interesting question and it does deserve some serious
<BR>
discussion.  Why have we got a billion people running their lives
<BR>
around an individual whose existance is up for question?!?
<BR>
<P>The lack of rational examination of this question is *stunning*.
<BR>
<P>My general feeling is that Jesus as an individual might have exiested.
<BR>
Throw out all of the virgin birth stuff and look at the missing 30
<BR>
years of his life.  If he happened to spend that time in far east
<BR>
studying Buddism and similar perspectives, then returned to try
<BR>
and transplant it onto the Jewish background with its predictions
<BR>
for a Messiah things start to make much more sense.   It was a
<BR>
case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and the
<BR>
hole basically won.  As the Gospels were written long after
<BR>
he was dead, when the religion was getting off the ground, there
<BR>
would seem to be ample room for embelishment, explaining the
<BR>
&quot;miracles&quot;, etc.  The suppressed areas of his life/teachings/followers
<BR>
(in the Gnostic religious sects?), point out that the &quot;popular&quot;
<BR>
information is a highly selective view.
<BR>
<P>So, in answer to Mick's question, I would say there is very little
<BR>
hard evidence that people would agree upon indicating he actually
<BR>
existed.  However, there is enough circumstantial evidence to believe
<BR>
that he might have existed but we have a classic case of the historians
<BR>
writing the history.
<BR>
<P>I believe that from a &quot;historical&quot; viewpoint, there is some evidence
<BR>
that the Roman governors of Palestine crucified any number of criminals
<BR>
and rabble-rousers.  So someone who was being acclaimed as a Messiah
<BR>
would certainly be viewed as a threat and dealt with accordingly.
<BR>
<P>In &quot;The Science of Aliens&quot; by Clifford Pickover, he discusses some of
<BR>
the tradeoffs involved in interpreting some of religous history as alien
<BR>
visitations.  He cites work by Eve LaPlante, who debunked many &quot;abduction&quot;
<BR>
stories, in saying that Mohammad, Moses and Saint Paul were probably victims
<BR>
of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (which would account for seeing &amp; hearing
<BR>
things).  He also quotes Dostoyevsky, who was an epileptic as
<BR>
believing that Mohammad was clearly an epileptic.
<BR>
<P>Robert Freitas, in Chapter 3 of his Xenology Volume, argues that
<BR>
much of the &quot;fanciful&quot; in Biblical history can be explained as
<BR>
sitings of visting aliens.  The tone of both the Pickover &amp; Freitas
<BR>
works would tend to cast doubt on the &quot;alien visitation&quot; explanations,
<BR>
but if you want to really believe in the &quot;miracles&quot;, this is the best
<BR>
scientific explanation for them.
