<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know what the solution is, but I'm leaning more and more toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; leaving the technology in the hands of Big Brother until we as a race 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mature enough to handle it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think this shows one of the major problems in this line of thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- because if Joe Q. Public is not to be trusted with a nanoassembler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how can we then trust Big Brother? If humans are not morally evolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough (whatever that means), then the aggregate of humans making up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Big Brother is also not likely to be morally evolved enough. And if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maniac with nano gives you bad dreams, then try not to dream about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nasty Big Brother with nano.
</EM><BR>
<P>You make a good point.  Although (probably by force of habit) I trust my 
<BR>
government with a nuclear bomb more than I would trust my neighbor, there is 
<BR>
always the potential for big brother to become malicious.  I am less worried 
<BR>
about this as I believe US-style government of the people, for the people 
<BR>
and by the people is becoming the global norm.  But still it will probably 
<BR>
be some time before I am willing to trust religious governments with 
<BR>
anything like nano-power.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the best alternative (and maybe the unavoidable alternative) is to 
<BR>
trust our fate to the electronic intelligences who will be our mental 
<BR>
descendants.  Sure they may decide to do away with us, but once (if) they 
<BR>
become sentient there may be little we can do to prevent that anyway.  I'd 
<BR>
probably be more willing to trust my fate to a completely rational EI than 
<BR>
my less than rational peers.
