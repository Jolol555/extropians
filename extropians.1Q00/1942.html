Hello,
<BR>
I'm going to make a wish.
<BR>
Is there anyone here that would highlight or summarize discussions being 
<BR>
conducted here?
<BR>
I see on this list there's a line as style in exposing things.
<BR>
Is there any way of highlighting like this for example.
<BR>
Thanks and ....
<BR>
CIAO
<BR>
Gabriele

<EM>&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman Sow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  Incredible movie. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     You mean you haven't got a DVD player yet?  Oh Randy get with the times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;video is sooooo 2nd Millennium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     I forget who came up with that line but I thought it was priceless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     That is a great movie though isn't it.  As far as acting, Carrey blew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Truman away when he played Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;When Truman came up against the wall at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     I can relate to that too.  Very often when people bring up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the &gt;topic of death, I will inevitably mention that death &quot;may&quot; not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; be &gt;inevitable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;When I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;try to explain that it is really just a problem with biology and it &gt;can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;be corrected, I usually get a look as if I just tore off my face 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and &gt;revealed some terrifying Sci Fi creature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I hear you. We are quite different from the ordinary run of people. That's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all there is to it. Somehow we took another path to being people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I never understood why this should come as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a shock to people these days.  As a species human kind has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;been &gt;searching for the answer to immortality from the moment we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;realized &gt;that we are alive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Somehow when we (as opposed to all those others) read something, or come 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;across some knowledge, we understand it in a different way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;have been searching for answers and now we are coming up with answers that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;don't involve having to die to get there.  Seems to me that there should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;less &quot;faith&quot; involved in physical immortality than the leap of faith or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;gamble that there may be a spiritual after life involving a transference into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;another dimension, an alternate reality or even an unseen UFO in the tail of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a comet.  To me these are no longer valid options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     Then there is the old why would anyone want to live forever refrain. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;someone truly does not care if they die than they are not really living to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;begin with.  Ask the same person if they would be willing to die tomorrow and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the answer is almost always &quot;no&quot;.  It should be obvious... That is the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;point!  Perhaps it's just another step in evolution or natures way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;choosing it's Immortals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I read a fascinating article today in Science News about how different 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;modes of reasoning are used by people of different cultures/continents. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The researchers tested reasoning skills of some people in Bumfuck Mongolia 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(East Uzbeck). They posed a situation where they said that all bears in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the northern part of the world were white. They said that a man from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;northern part of the world had seen a bear. The researchers then asked the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tribesmen what color the bear must have been. Without exception, to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;growing  frustration of the researhers. all the men replied, &quot;Well, how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would I know?! Ask your friend who saw the bear!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The study concluded, citing numerous other examples of typical cultural 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasoning, that analytical reasoning is a learned skill, and not something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innate, or something to that effect....
