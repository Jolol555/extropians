<P><EM> &gt; That depends. If you want a heterogenous system, then you need to take the sum 
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't want anything, as it is your question. However, while
<BR>
homogenous (say, tetranitrotetrahedrane (unlike octanitrocubane, not
<BR>
yet synthesized), or salts with N5+ ion), the energy density in
<BR>
explosives is not very high. One typically achieves higher densities
<BR>
in heterogenous systems (sometimes one uses heterogenous/homogenous
<BR>
mixes, adding finely dispersed aluminum to explosives, for
<BR>
instance). Of course, purely heterogenous systems do not detonate very
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>Have a gander at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/asearch?type=all&query=%22high+density+explosive%22">http://www.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/asearch?type=all&query=%22high+density+explosive%22</A> 
<BR>
<P>and do a websearch on &quot;high energy density&quot; (maybe &quot;high energy
<BR>
density materials&quot; aka HEDM).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; of the inputs to determine the grams (or mililiters) to the number of joules 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; output. I'm assuming that a nanotech solution might be able to mix hererogenous 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; chemicals in a stable form until a trigger is given.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you talking about an explosive device or a fuel cell?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Oh? I thought the hydrogen-hydrogen bond was fairly week by chemical standards. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The bond might be weak (one would ideally want N-N triple bond
<BR>
formation), but then in chemistry you typically do not have educts in
<BR>
atomic form. In fact I doubt an atomic hydrogen suspension in liquid
<BR>
He would be very stable at all. Atomic stuff embedded in a matrix (Ar,
<BR>
or some other noble gas) will be probably too dilute. Atomic nitrogen,
<BR>
in an Ar matrix? Might work. Just don't warm it up ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Is it just the sheer density of atomic hydrogen that you could get?  If so, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; having to dilute it with something else might be greatly detrimental to its 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; efficiency.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Interesting, but not really within the realm of chemical energy anymore.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't really matter, storing energy in inertia wheels isn't
<BR>
chemical energy either. As of Rhombic (caution: it might be vaporware
<BR>
or a straight hoax, the company site strikes me slightly kooky), I
<BR>
like the 1 kW/1.5 kg density specs, and the non-Carnot nature of the
<BR>
thing (really elegant, this). Interesting, what the lifetime is (how
<BR>
much rad does the diamond still get?), and how much energy integrated
<BR>
over total operational time the device releases.
<BR>
<P>As usually, we live in truly interesting times.
