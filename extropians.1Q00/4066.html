<EM>&gt; &gt; I want an uploading process that actually takes my brain

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my humble opinion that's not possible. I feel it is impossible for the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason I don't believe in ghosts, vitalism of the soul, pure energy beings with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex intelligence's, spirits or any non material mind et cetera . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe for information to be stored and manipulated one needs a complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material apparatus to direct energy about--to and fro--like the switches and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gates in silicon chips or the earlier transistors. I believe neurons can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to these same gates and switches. If you smash those neurons or turn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them to dust there is no more information or mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you, James, although in your next comments, I couldn't
<BR>
figure out at first what you meant by &quot;xian&quot;. You mean &quot;Christian&quot;,
<BR>
right, as in writing Xmass, instead of Christmas? Kinda cute, but I
<BR>
really had to think to figure it out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suppose a person, a pious priest even, has a brain injury. Before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the injury s/he was good and pious and caring and would never consider acting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overtly evil (by western xian definitions). After the injury . . . even murderous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual. Has the soul changed? In xian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms is s/he now considered hell bound and damned? (as seen by other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans--not making assumptions about godly forgiveness, so let's not go there)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is if the mind or soul were &quot;vital&quot; no amount of damage to the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could affect behavior. We know it does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since damage to the material does affect behavior/information, then the mind is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the pattern in that matter not the electrochemical energy scurrying about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from neuron to neuron.
</EM><BR>
<P>In scientific terms, this idea of mind as an organized, causally
<BR>
developing pattern is almost surely the only one that makes any sense.
<BR>
Disrupt the pattern, and this brings the personal integrity of the
<BR>
developing mind into question. Indeed, the practical identity of one's
<BR>
original mind could quite possibly be effectively destroyed no matter
<BR>
how much the *new* pattern claims to be the same person. Outside of
<BR>
stories from the field of medicine, people obviously tend to shy away
<BR>
from this sort of &quot;fate worse than death&quot; stuff, and prefer not to deal
<BR>
with any philosophical implications that consideration of disrupted or
<BR>
damaged minds might tend to bring up.
<BR>
<P>In my own personal thoughts about grand scale philosophy, I myself have
<BR>
sometimes forgotten that the human mind must necessarily have this the
<BR>
basic physical vulnerability. For instance, it's sometimes seemed like a
<BR>
neat idea to me to think that I could personally survive in a &quot;galaxy,
<BR>
far away&quot;, if only a near perfect copy of me were somehow generated
<BR>
*way* out there (this would be almost as in a religious afterlife, in
<BR>
the sense that science wouldn't have the &quot;ghost&quot; of a chance of
<BR>
detecting such an unlikely, faraway, event). Unfortunately, for this to
<BR>
work, I have to deal with it as an outcome of space being infinite,
<BR>
which in turn also means infinite numbers of copies that aren't really
<BR>
enough like me to *be* me, also infinite numbers of copies that would
<BR>
resemble a brain damaged me. The result is that it's much better to deal
<BR>
with my real survival as something actually, instrumentally detectable
<BR>
to science on *this* planet (if technology is advanced and I am
<BR>
sufficiently lucky, anyway). Referring to my &quot;far galaxy&quot; fantasy,
<BR>
what's the good of those randomly generated person-copies, if they are
<BR>
so far away as to be detached from everything currently around me, and
<BR>
also apt to be somewhat like the brain damaged &quot;Man Who Mistook his Wife
<BR>
for a Hat&quot;, more likely than not?
<BR>
<P>Getting back to high-tech uploading and the like, if we develop the
<BR>
technology for making mind copies, we'll presumably take great care that
<BR>
the copies are good, complete, and reliable &quot;whole mind&quot; copies of our
<BR>
original thoughts, emotions, and dispositions. Further, if we want it
<BR>
that way, we could also take care to shut down our old brains, in good
<BR>
timing with starting up any new uploads of ourselves. So, no &quot;old self&quot;
<BR>
watching the new self, and wondering if it is &quot;really me&quot;, at least if
<BR>
we care to do it the right way, instead (OK, maybe there'll some such
<BR>
doppleganger awkwardness for a few of the volunteers in the initial R&amp;D
<BR>
for the upload technique). Given that we're *not* talking about random
<BR>
damage here, and given that we *are* talking about one way to
<BR>
verifiably, really, survive, I don't see what the objection to a truly
<BR>
*good* uploading procedure might be. Could it be that there are really
<BR>
bad, lingering philosophical memes in the way of many people, memes like
<BR>
&quot;I don't need a tech answer, I'll try for a sure thing in Heaven, or
<BR>
maybe in a &quot;random galaxy, far away&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the most scientifically interesting topic that relates to this
<BR>
right now is the controversy over whether cryonically frozen people
<BR>
could ever really be revived, as themselves, with practical memory and
<BR>
identity intact. In this regard, I was interested to read Robert J.
<BR>
Bradbury's recent (Wed, March 1st), message, where he raised a concern
<BR>
about lysosomal enzymes possibly destroying the mind patterns of current
<BR>
cryonically frozen persons. The concern here is one of enzymes almost
<BR>
literally chewing up memories, as in &quot;there go the neurotransmitter
<BR>
proteins that marked the path to remembering who my best friend was when
<BR>
I was twelve&quot; -- that sort of thing could be a real &quot;ouch&quot;! The point
<BR>
is, if memories and skills can be preserved by freezing, that's good,
<BR>
but if there is a real problem that essentially destroys the protein
<BR>
structure of brain synapses, then cryonics as we know it would be a
<BR>
total loss, or else just a gamble that didn't work.
