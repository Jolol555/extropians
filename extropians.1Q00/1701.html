<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                        January 28, 2000
<BR>
<P>BREAST CANCER SCREENING AID CLEARED FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war against breast cancer has a new weapon, thanks to an
<BR>
advanced sensor developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device, called the BioScan System, was developed by
<BR>
OmniCorder Technologies, Inc., Stony Brook, N.Y.  OmniCorder received
<BR>
clearance to market the system from the Food and Drug Administration
<BR>
in December 1999.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have determined that cancer cells exude nitric oxide.
<BR>
This causes changes in blood flow in tissue surrounding cancer that
<BR>
can be detected by the sensor.  The BioScan System is sensitive to
<BR>
temperature changes of less than .015 degree Celsius (.027 degree
<BR>
Fahrenheit) and has a speed of more than 200 frames per second.  It
<BR>
causes no discomfort to the patient and uses no ionizing radiation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Clearance for use of this noninvasive diagnostic tool is an
<BR>
important milestone for us,&quot; said OmniCorder president and CEO Mark
<BR>
Fauci, who noted that the device has also been cleared to be marketed
<BR>
for other applications.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensor, called the Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector
<BR>
(QWIP), was invented by Dr. Sarath Gunapala, principal engineer of
<BR>
JPL's Device Research and Applications Section. The digital sensor
<BR>
detects the infrared energy emitted from the body, thus &quot;seeing&quot; the
<BR>
minute differences associated with blood flow changes.  Earlier
<BR>
versions of QWIP had potential applications, such as locating hot
<BR>
spots during fires and observing volcanoes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is a great pleasure to see something I invented being used
<BR>
for public benefit,&quot; said Gunapala, &quot;especially in medicine and even
<BR>
more so in the early detection of cancer.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The BioScan System also uses Dynamic Area Telethermometry,
<BR>
invented by Dr. Michael Anbar, founding scientist of OmniCorder.  The
<BR>
two technologies work together to image the target area and to provide
<BR>
the physician with immediate diagnostic information.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology,
<BR>
Pasadena, Calif.
