</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Do you ever get the feeling that just plain ol' luck is behind much of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens in life?  Are the Bill Joys, Alfred Noyces, Bill Gateses, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really supreme geniuses, or did they just win some kind of global lottery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No question, that when opportunity knocks, you have to get up and answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the door.  But you also have to live in the right neighborhood, and be at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;home at the time.  You could add to that, your parents answering their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respective doors before you, and their parents before them.  An amazing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;string of sevens at the cosmic crap table leads to the founding of a Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Microsystems, an Intel, or a Microsoft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have no doubt that Bill Joy is a very talented software architect.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would surprise me a whole heck of a lot if most of the folks on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list couldn't have done all that Bill Joy did, had they been in his shoes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when opportunity--the silicon revolution--came knocking.  Read the bio part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of his wired article.  Between the lines I got the impression that when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was at Berkeley, buried beneath his work, the OTHER Sun Microsystems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;founders came and found him.  Dragged him off.  Now he thinks he's hot 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Mommy, mommy, the future scares me!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Go back to Aspen, Bill.  Write some more code.  The future doesn't need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;YOU.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;lots of snipping&gt;
<BR>
<P>Well, I do agree with what I think is your main point:  That Bill Joy tends 
<BR>
to overstate the magnitude of the danger from GNR tech and, moreover, he 
<BR>
doesn't really seem qualified to serve as the point man on this issue.  But 
<BR>
I wouldn't be as hard on old Bill as you are.  After all Ray Kurzweil (who 
<BR>
at least has a more proven track record when it comes to prediction of 
<BR>
future tech) wrote that we have ~50% chance of exterminating ourselves with 
<BR>
GNR.  And he considers himself an *optimist*.  My vote for point man on the 
<BR>
issue would probably be Eric Drexler, and he was so worried about the 
<BR>
dangerous potential of nanotech that he started the Foresight Institute to 
<BR>
get smart folks thinking and talking about how to minimize the risks.
<BR>
<P>Sure we might have preferred that someone else had appointed themselves town 
<BR>
crier on this issue, and we might agree that Bill Joy tends to be a little 
<BR>
reactionary in his characterization of the risks.  But the fact of the 
<BR>
matter is that we *are* hurtling headlong into a great unknown that, by 
<BR>
*all* accounts, has some potential to end in utter global disaster.  It was 
<BR>
Drexler, after all, who came up with &quot;gray goo,&quot; not Bill Joy.  So perhaps 
<BR>
it is a good thing that Bill Joy has put these questions on the radar screen 
<BR>
of the general public.  At least it will get people talking.  If Joy's fears 
<BR>
are completely unfounded, that will be revealed by the national debate he 
<BR>
has fomented.  But we must recognize the possibility (however remote) that 
<BR>
extreme pessimists like Bill Joy are right and extreme optimists (like you) 
<BR>
are wrong.  In any event, given the *huge* magnitude of the potential 
<BR>
dangers, it is probably a good idea to have a national (preferably a global) 
<BR>
debate so that a consensus (if possible) can be reached.
<BR>
<P>By the way, as to your observations of Bills Joy and Gates being winners in 
<BR>
the lottery of life, I agree.  You have to be at the right place at the 
<BR>
right time.  But you also have to be prepared to take advantages of 
<BR>
opportunities as they arise.  Because like it or not, I was at the same 
<BR>
right place at the right time as Bill Gates.  However, I had not spent my 
<BR>
youth learning to code and did not have the foresight to develop an 
<BR>
operating system and market it to IBM.  Further, if I'd had the foresight 
<BR>
(say 20 years ago or so) to invest every dollar I could scrape together into 
<BR>
Microsoft, I'd be one of those lucky lottery winners, and if you had done 
<BR>
the same so would you.
<BR>
<P>But I don't begrudge those who were lucky enough to do it.  And I don't 
<BR>
agree that fortune just fell into their laps just because they happened to 
<BR>
be at the right place at the right time.  Sure they were lucky, but luck is 
<BR>
just the nexus of preparation and opportunity.  The preparation component is 
<BR>
just as important as the opportunity component.  You want to be lucky?  
<BR>
Here's a hint:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The harder I work, the luckier I get.&quot;  Can't remember who this quote is 
<BR>
attributed to.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
