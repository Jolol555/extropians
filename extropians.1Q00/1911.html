<P><EM> &gt; Eugene, someday you are just going to have to prove to me that you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are a card-carrying Extropian.  Sometimes the things you say leave
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; me doubting...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
(Pst! I'm a crypto-entropian agent, spreading the corrosive doctrine
<BR>
of dynamic pessimism!)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; As I tried to indicate the market will take some time to develop.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but I was talking about near-future. Methinks I saw a methanol
<BR>
refueling station a few weeks ago. If future infrastructure will we
<BR>
developed with methanol in mind, we could have gas stations which also 
<BR>
could double for methanol refuelling, without any corrosion problems.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The California Y2004 laws for non-polluting fleet sales begin drive
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this forward.  Once you get the car volumes high enough, translating
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; into low enough costs for fuel cells, then as the automobile fleet
</EM><BR>
<P>First onboard methanol reformers, then directly methanol metabolizing
<BR>
cells. Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; slowly gets replaced a market slowly develops.  Yes for the first 3-5
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; years you still pump in gas/alcohol from your gas station.  But pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; soon the Agriculture industry wakes up to the fact that they can grow the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fuel and do so (they do it now, but the market is still limited by
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure the renewables will play a major role in the
<BR>
picture. Biomass takes land to grow, usually creating denaturated
<BR>
habitats. Also, synthesis gas production from biomass is less
<BR>
convenient then coke, oil or methane.  Methane, especially als
<BR>
clathrate (methane hydrate), seems to be highly plentiful. Renewables
<BR>
might just have a hard time to compete. And then direct photosynthesis 
<BR>
will arrive, as well as microwaved power from the skies.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the fuel consumption technology).  After that some bright entrepreneurs
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; wake up to the fact that you can grow it at home.  Since one can see
</EM><BR>
<P>Why aren't we seeing any <A HREF="http://www.rooftop.com/">http://www.rooftop.com/</A> ? 
<BR>
<P>Because they undermine the customer/ISP relationship. Customers can
<BR>
create their own networks, by virtue of operating a box on the top of
<BR>
their houses. I don't think it's a coincidence Nokia bought them, and
<BR>
keeps the technology off market.
<BR>
<P>The energy providers will try to actively suppress proliferation of
<BR>
such empowering technologies. This might seriously delay deployment.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the path, then some bright folks will push the last step
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; earlier in the process and you get Fuel@Home groups springing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; up around the country.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Your perspective regarding the difficulties for PhoMe is justified
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for today, but not in light of the path I've outlined above.   Some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;mandated&quot; requirements to drive fuel cell technology development is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; necessary.  Then the turnover time in automobile fleet replacement is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; constraint.  The bacteria look difficult now, but in 10 years they will be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; easy and the development costs will be cheap (I've done the numbers --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; *unbelieveably* cheap).
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I don't think you could ever harvest high-proof methanol hooch from
<BR>
bacteria directly (i.e. without further destillation, which is a
<BR>
pain). You rather need immobilized, stabilized enzymatic systems, a
<BR>
kind of photosynthetic panel fixing (ideally atmospheric) carbon
<BR>
dioxide and water to directly produce methanol from captured photons.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The market development time will drive the fuel production methods.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; And MeOH distribution infrastructure by then
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; will be dominated by these previously in charge of it, i.e. abovesaid.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Initially, no argument, but unless they get clever and get zoning
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; restrictions on Fuel@Home, I don't see how they can stop it.  The Oil
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and Gas industries haven't stopped the installation of solar hot water
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in homes, but the penetration has been slow because the installation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is still a labor intensive process and that makes the payback time long.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The long payback times (10+ years?) really diminish the incentives
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to get the loan, manage the subcontractor, etc.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It is actually good that the fossil people think methanol is not the
<BR>
enemy. At least initially they will help to roll out the
<BR>
infrastructure. After they realize what is going on, it will be too late...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Fuel@Home is somewhat simpler because it doesn't have to be tied into
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the existing home infrastructure to the same degree.  What will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; make it fly is a kit that most do-it-yourselfers can install.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Then you could see automobile suppliers providing the kits as part
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the purchase package to make the sale a better &quot;deal&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I suspect the average person annually spends 5-10 times as much on gas
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; as they do on hot water, so if you can get the kit cost down to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 3-5x the average annual fuel bill I think its a no brainer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great. How long until you can buy such a kit? 30 years? 40?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Its worth noting that for many of the oil producing countries, though
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this dampens their revenue stream from depleting natural resources,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; many of them are relatively rich in land mass and renewable solar
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; energy.  The question will be whether they build up their educated
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; populations (engineers, etc.) to levels that are high enough that they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can develop technologies that take advantage of this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Currently there is no evidence for this. They still have plenty of
<BR>
time, however, and surely enough financial resources to buy any
<BR>
technology/specialists they need.
