<P>
I have no knowledge of the practical application of Cryonics so I'd like
<BR>
to ask those that do if the following is a nutty idea. As I understand it
<BR>
some otherwise promising cryoprotectants are rendered useless
<BR>
because they're too viscous to infuse at body temperature, much
<BR>
less during cool down. But what if you engineered a bacteria to produce
<BR>
the cryoprotectant and then infused the bacteria; wouldn't that make the
<BR>
viscosity of the substance irrelevant and as a bonus be dirt cheap too?
<BR>
<P>I got to thinking about this when I read at <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/mussels.htm">http://www.doe.gov/mussels.htm</A>
<BR>
about a super glue that mussels use to attach themselves to rocks. This
<BR>
viscous super strong adhesive turns hard as a rock in about 60 seconds
<BR>
and is made up of 5 proteins. Scientists have now cloned all five genes
<BR>
that make the proteins so soon they'll be able to make the stuff by the ton,
<BR>
before it took 10,000 mussels to produce one gram of the adhesive.
<BR>
<P>I recall that in the August 21 1997 issue of Nature there is an article by
<BR>
Virginia K Walker and Peter L Davies about a protein in the cold resistant
<BR>
mealworm insect that is the most powerful known organic antifreeze, 100
<BR>
times as potent as the one found in arctic fish. It lowers the freezing point
<BR>
but it also does something much more important, when things get really cold
<BR>
and ice does form it does so as smooth hexagonal disks, not as dangerous
<BR>
sharp edges and pointy spikes which is what you get without any antifreeze
<BR>
or even if you use the one from arctic fish. Since only one protein is involved
<BR>
not 5  I would imagine it would be easier make cryoprotectant than adhesive
<BR>
but to my knowledge this has not been done, probably because most
<BR>
think a new glue is far more valuable than a new cryoprotectant.
