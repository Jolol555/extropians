<EM>&gt; Another factor to consider - what would the typical person's reaction be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon seeing a news report about pro-life groups financing cryonics for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fetuses? Probably laughter, and after that, a mental association of
</EM><BR>
cryonics
<BR>
<EM>&gt; with the pro-life movement.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are at least three problems with this.  One, most people know very
<BR>
little about cryonics anyway.  So, said news report would probably go
<BR>
unnoticed.  Two, cryonics is already thought of as weird, whacky, kooky,
<BR>
etc.  The image problem is already here and it's sticking.  It might change,
<BR>
but I think that will happen as the technology gets better -- not by passing
<BR>
up chances to get more people on board.  (Certainly, a lot of cryonicists
<BR>
have courted religious types before -- trying to get them on board.  Why
<BR>
don't they stop?  After all, cryonics will look laughable, according to Zeb,
<BR>
if it becomes associated with them, right?:)
<BR>
<P>Third, there are a lot of pro-Lifers out there.  Surely, only a few a
<BR>
willing to protest abortions and, thankfully, even fewer are willing to bomb
<BR>
clinics, but this is true of any movement.  If my memory's correct, the %age
<BR>
of Americans* who are pro-Life is about 30 or 40%.  That's not a fringe
<BR>
group.  After all, most of the GOP Presidential candidates in the US run on
<BR>
a platform that is antiabortion.
<BR>
<P>Have to really run now!

* I'm using them as examples because a) these are the ones I'm familiar with
<BR>
and b) America has the biggest chunk of the cryonics pie.
