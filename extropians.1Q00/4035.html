<EM>&gt; I totally agree.  For the same reasons I do not want to be uploaded.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would only wind up with a perfect copy of me and so the process had better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not kill me! lol  I want an uploading process that actually takes my brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and transforms it into a form of energy without any loss to the authentic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I'd like to do is non-destructively copy myself a lot of times (upload,
<BR>
but &quot;I&quot; am still little old me), onto really mega hardware, then ask all the
<BR>
new me's to work out how to get &quot;me&quot; in there too, with the other &quot;me's&quot;
<BR>
running at super dooper really fast speed, giving them access to methods of
<BR>
upgrading their hardware, etc.
<BR>
<P>I think this would probably work because
<BR>
a) I'm smart; lots of sooped-up versions of me could crack this before
<BR>
(virtual) lunchtime, and
<BR>
b) I'm a really nice guy, so I'd want to help myself out, even if it wasn't
<BR>
really myself, you know the drill.
