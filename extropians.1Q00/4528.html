THE DURK PEARSON &amp; SANDY SHAW LIFE EXTENSION NEWS 
<BR>
FDA UPDATE!!---FDA's Ten Year Plan
<BR>
The FDA's newly announced Ten Year Plan for Dietary Supplement Strategy is
<BR>
a real laugh. (Those who want to read the whole thing can download it at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/">http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/</A>) The FDA states, as the goal of its Ten Year
<BR>
Plan that, by the year 2010, the FDA will have established a
<BR>
&quot;science-based regulatory program that fully implements the Dietary
<BR>
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).&quot; So it only takes
<BR>
them (if they meet their &quot;goal&quot;) sixteen years to implement the DSHEA. 
<BR>
Many of the items listed in the Ten Year Plan as subgoals, such as
<BR>
defining the difference between a dietary supplement and a drug and
<BR>
defining when a disease claim for a dietary supplement becomes a drug
<BR>
claim, are issues that have already been decided in the relevant
<BR>
Congressional statute (DSHEA) that determines the extent of FDA authority
<BR>
over dietary supplements. The classes of substances that qualify as
<BR>
dietary supplements are explicitly given in the DSHEA. The DSHEA also
<BR>
makes it clear that a truthful statement of a substance-disease
<BR>
relationship about a dietary supplement is not be regulated as a drug
<BR>
claim.

<P>ARE WE TO BECOME SERFS OF THE DRUG MONOPOLY?  By William Faloon
<BR>
While politicians are trying to get Medicare (meaning the taxpayer) to
<BR>
shoulder part of this burden, The Life Extension Foundation has shown that
<BR>
inflated drug prices are a result of a protected monopoly the FDA grants
<BR>
to the pharmaceutical giants. As anyone familiar with free markets knows,
<BR>
lack of competition means the consumer pays exorbitant prices for lower
<BR>
quality products. In the case of prescription drugs, Americans pay the
<BR>
highest prices in the world and are often the last the gain access to
<BR>
therapies that were long ago approved in other countries. 
<BR>
Up until now, HMOs and insurance companies have been subsidizing consumer
<BR>
prescription drug purchases through nominal &quot;co-pay&quot; arrangements. That
<BR>
price protection is rapidly vanishing, as most HMOs have lost money over
<BR>
the last three years and are raising premiums and co-pays on prescription
<BR>
drugs to cut the financial hemorrhage. In some cases, HMOs are going out
<BR>
of business because their premium base does not cover the skyrocketing
<BR>
costs of prescription drugs.

What's Hot
<BR>
----------
<BR>
GOVERNMENT STOPS BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG TRIAL 
<BR>
After results showed the blood pressure drug Cardura prevented far fewer
<BR>
heart complications than a cheaper, more conventional water pill, the
<BR>
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) prematurely halted that
<BR>
portion of a large cardiovascular drug study and urged patients taking the
<BR>
medication to consult their doctors. &quot;Cardura was less effective at
<BR>
lowering blood pressure and at preventing cardiovascular complications,
<BR>
particularly heart failure,&quot; said study steering committee chairman Dr.
<BR>
Curt Furberg of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. &quot;It is also
<BR>
ten times more expensive than the diuretic.&quot;

<BR>
<P>ATRIAL FIBRILLATION COMPLICATES HEART ATTACK RECOVERY 
<BR>
Approximately two million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, an
<BR>
irregular heart quivering more common in older adults. Researchers at
<BR>
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., found 22 percent
<BR>
of elderly heart attack patients experienced atrial fibrillation prior to
<BR>
or just after suffering a heart attack. Patients with both conditions
<BR>
experienced more disability and death than people who suffered a heart
<BR>
attack but no atrial fibrillation. &quot;We didn't think atrial fibrillation
<BR>
would be as common as we found it to be,&quot; said senior author Dr. Allen J.
<BR>
Solomon. &quot;When elderly heart attack patients have atrial fibrillation,
<BR>
they are at increased risk for having a stroke, congestive heart failure
<BR>
or a second heart attack. Their hospital stay is also longer.&quot;

GLAUCOMA
<BR>
To understand glaucoma, it is necessary to comprehend the responsibilities
<BR>
of the various structures of the eye and their placement.  Recall that the
<BR>
iris is the colored portion of the eye that contains smooth muscle and
<BR>
regulates the amount of light entering the eye. The pupil is the opening
<BR>
in the iris, through which light passes to the lens and the retina. The
<BR>
cornea is the part of the eye that produces the greatest amount of
<BR>
convergence of light and comprises 1/6th of the outermost tunic, referred
<BR>
to as the fibrous tunic of the eye bulb. The retina or nervous tunic is
<BR>
the innermost tunic of the eye. The optic nerve passes through the retina
<BR>
at a point called the blind spot. This is an apt description, for the
<BR>
blind spot contains neither rods, photoreceptors that respond to dim
<BR>
light, or cones, photoreceptors that respond to bright light and allow
<BR>
color vision. Nerve impulses initiated by the rods and cones are passed to
<BR>
the bipolar cells, which in turn pass them to the ganglionic cells. The
<BR>
fibers of these cells pass in front of the retina forming the optic nerve,
<BR>
which carries the nerve impulses to the brain
<BR>
Grape seed-skin extract, a proanthocyanidin, is considered a powerful
<BR>
antioxidant, defending the collagen matrix against free radial attack and
<BR>
guarding it against enzymatic breakdown, through the enhanced delivery of
<BR>
oxygen and blood to the eye. When normal mechanisms designed to deliver
<BR>
oxygen fail, a variety of ocular disorders can develop.

THE FOURTH ALCOR CONFERENCE ON LIFE EXTENSION TECHNOLOGIES
<BR>
The world is changing rapidly. Only a few years ago, most people
<BR>
considered cloning of mammals to be no more than science fiction.
<BR>
Repeated successes in this area have shown to be a reality today. More
<BR>
importantly, medical technologies like cloning and the use of embryonic
<BR>
stem cells to regenerate tissues, promise to make it possible to reverse
<BR>
all the major degenerative diseases within our own lifetimes. Even aging
<BR>
itself is under heavy attack by today's biological and medical
<BR>
technologies. 
<BR>
The Fourth Alcor Conference of Life Extension Technologies is a meeting of
<BR>
scientists and individuals who are working toward the expansion of human
<BR>
health and longevity. This conference will cover topics relevant to these
<BR>
pursuits.
