</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Very interesting paper!  A few comments and nitpicks:
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, both for the praise and the criticism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This &quot;Doubles of DT&quot; also took me a few minutes to figure out.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll try to improve my presentation of this and the other awkward
<BR>
parts you mention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I was puzzled by 2019 as the date the most recent technology &quot;began&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to dominate, and at first I thought it must be a typo.  Later on it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explained that technically, by this model, the &quot;old&quot; economy, based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agriculture, is still larger than the &quot;new&quot; economy, based on industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not until 2019 will the new economy grow larger than the old economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is this consistent with economic data?  Is the total GWP today from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agriculture still greater than that from industry?
</EM><BR>
<P>Good questions.  I'll try to take a look at it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It also seems questionable whether the industrial revolution can sustain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a doubling rate of 6.3 years.  The figures from the other model of 58
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or 15 years seem more reasonable.  Wouldn't we expect something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the DJIA to model the growth rate of industry over much of this century?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think it had a doubling time of more like 15-20 years, until this past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decade anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the middle of the transition (where we still are), the growth rate
<BR>
is only half of what it will be at the end.  So the doubling time of 15
<BR>
years over the last half century is consistent with the model.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, how do you figure 9.2 doubles of WP for the industrial term?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You say that this is the number of doubles &quot;during a term's period&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but when did the period for the industrial term start?  I thought you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would start from 2019.
</EM><BR>
<P>It actually the doubles of WP at the end of a term's period (assuming
<BR>
it was the last term), vs. what WP would have been without that term.
<BR>
I'll try to reword.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;These are amazing graphs, but there are some confusing aspects.  I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem to figure out why, qualitatively, the &quot;next&quot; transition looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so different in figure 2 from the previous ones.  For all the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transitions we see leveling, then a bump, then more leveling.  For the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next transition we just see it take off straight up.  Why is it that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;earlier transitions looked like they leveled off but this one doesn't?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a matter of what origin is used for the logs on the X axis.
<BR>
It is LOG(2050 - date), and if you switch 2050 to something different,
<BR>
the graph looks different.  Happy to send anyone the spreadsheet so
<BR>
they can play with things themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For figure 3, it appears to show that this two-week doubling transition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will lead to an annual growth rate of about 8.  But in fact it should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be something like sixty million?  Is this chart showing the log of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;annual growth rate, or the actual growth rate itself?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is showing the actual growth rate, but an instantaneous rate, in
<BR>
annual units.  That is, it's showing the number that appears in the
<BR>
exponent, as the B in Y = A*Exp(B*t).
