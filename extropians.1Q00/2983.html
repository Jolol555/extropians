<P><EM>&gt;            ``The more hours people use the Internet, the less time

<EM>&gt;            they spend with real human beings,'' said Norman Nie...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... I wonder exactly who we are talking with on the net. OK, a
<BR>
quick survey: how many of us are AIs, posthumans, jupiter brains,
<BR>
fictional people, uplifted squids, dogs or internet protocols?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I will spare you the rest.  It did get me to thinking however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what if... somehow our new heaven-sent toy were to disappear,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we were to go back to the way we were, before the internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if we had to rely mostly upon our neighbors for social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contact?  I have never felt so alone as when I am at a block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; party with my neighbors.  We have so very little to talk about,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so little in common. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. Once upon a time we were forced to interact with people
<BR>
simply because of physical proximity (or social class, which often
<BR>
translated into proximity anyway), but now we are associating
<BR>
depending on shared interests, values and projects. Maybe we are
<BR>
really becoming more *efficient* in our social interactions since we
<BR>
now can find the people to have fruitful interactions with more
<BR>
easily? There is no doubt that there are some drawbacks and social
<BR>
contacts we simply have to handle anyway despite a lack of suitable
<BR>
conversation subjects, but overall I think this could be the start of
<BR>
something new and positive in the development of humanity. Or another
<BR>
reason for the species to splinter into special interest groups :-)
