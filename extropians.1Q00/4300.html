<EM>&gt; &gt; James, the scenario you gave of skycars crashing into people on the ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is frightening and yet each year in the U.S. about fifty-thousand people die
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in car accidents!  And a large percentage involving the abuse of drugs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alcohol.  I see skycars being safer then that!  Especially with automatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; controls guided by gps.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Moller skycar uses automatic ejected parachutes as a safety system, so the fear
<BR>
of skycars falling out of the sky is an erroneous fear. Most all car accidents occur
<BR>
due to a car colliding with another car or another object in or along a roadway.
<BR>
Roads are rather confining spaces, and constituted less than 1% of all surface area
<BR>
of the country. It only follows that if cars were free to travel over any surface,
<BR>
not just on roads, there would be far fewer car collisions. Furthermore, given  the
<BR>
addition of a third demension of altitude to the transportation system, there is
<BR>
millions of times more space for people to drive sky cars than they can drive
<BR>
conventional cars, so this will actually reduce the number of collisiions.
<BR>
<P>While air traffic accidents are frequently in the news, there are less than one or
<BR>
two dozen such accidents in the US each year, compared to tens of thousands of
<BR>
accidents on the congested roadways. Most air traffic accidents occur because of
<BR>
three reasons:
<BR>
a) pilot error
<BR>
b) mechanical failure
<BR>
c) overuse of congested air traffic pathways near airports with minimal air traffic
<BR>
controllers and NO collision avoidance systems.
<BR>
<P>Because the Moller skycar is a vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, it can take off
<BR>
and land from anywhere, so the need for airports, and the congested airspace around
<BR>
them, will be obsolete.
<BR>
<P>The collision avoidance technology, and the parachute safety system built into the
<BR>
Moller sky car, eliminates the problems of crashes due to pilot error or mechanical
<BR>
failure, (except in the case that there are multiple engine failures AND the
<BR>
parachute sytem fails.) The Moller Skycar has eight rotary engines built into it,
<BR>
and it can withstand the loss of all but two of these and maintain level flight as a
<BR>
conventional aircraft (and can land horizontally at a conventional landing field in
<BR>
such event).
<BR>
<P>My own prediction that if the Moller skycar is adopted, traffic accidents will go
<BR>
down markedly.
