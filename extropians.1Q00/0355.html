<P>
I see little reason to believe that MNT would lead immediately to an
<BR>
elimination of capitalism or a more even distribution of wealth in society.
<BR>
<P>I have three primary objections to the arguments put forth in THE SPIKE
<BR>
<P>1) As Robert Bradbury points out in another post, a major limitation of
<BR>
nanotech is the complexity of design.  I liken this to the software market
<BR>
that exists today.  It takes the investment of millions of man hours to
<BR>
produce many of the software packages used today.  That translates into tens
<BR>
or hundreds of millions of dollars.  That level of investment will only
<BR>
occur in an environment where a similar pay-off can occur.  That means that
<BR>
there will effectively be intellectual property protection for nanotech
<BR>
designs.
<BR>
<P>It's true that there are large and growing shareware, freeware, and
<BR>
open-source software options.  Nevertheless, the majority of software used
<BR>
in developed nations today is bought and paid for.  Indeed, even in the
<BR>
linux market, there is money changing hands to vendors such as Red Hat who
<BR>
provide support, documentation, their own extensions of the system, etc..
<BR>
So long as there is intellectual work to be done to make nanotech useful,
<BR>
there is likely to be compensation for that work.
<BR>
<P>2) THE SPIKE points out an interesting rule of safe nanotech development:
<BR>
Never create a nanite that can duplicate itself outside of controlled
<BR>
conditions.  Furthermore, the model of MNT you present has many construction
<BR>
components outside the nanites:  A vat in which the construction takes
<BR>
place, the pumps that bring in streams of raw material, the macro-assemblers
<BR>
that put together finished pieces, etc..   All of this suggests to me that
<BR>
with MNT we will still have /factories/ of one form or another.  Simply
<BR>
having a universal assembler and a design for the product I want will not be
<BR>
a sufficient condition to build the product I want.  I will need a
<BR>
specialized facility to safely use that assembler in.
<BR>
<P>3) Incentive.  Consider this a concern with the open source model overall:
<BR>
In a world where all of ones needs can be met with no effort on one's part,
<BR>
where is the incentive to work?  Certainly there are some people who have
<BR>
that incentive, out of curiosity, pride, a desire for fame or glory, etc..
<BR>
But there may be a larger number of people who are equally happy spending
<BR>
all their time in leisure activities that do not directly contribute to the
<BR>
welfare of humanity at large.  One of the two fundamental brilliances of
<BR>
capitalism is that it channels selfishness into behavior that benefits
<BR>
others.  Essential human self-interest (and tribe-interest), in the absence
<BR>
of any structure that directs it, is the ultimate problem in any utopia.  
<BR>
<P>(BTW, all this aside, I enjoyed THE SPIKE and look forward to the US
<BR>
edition.)

<EM>&gt; Sorry to keep banging on about this, but I'm deep into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revisions, updates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and expansions of my book THE SPIKE, for publication in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USA later this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year. I'm try to address some of the critical objections to v. 1.0,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially certain complaints that the economics (implicit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and explicit)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were handwaving and/or naive. I'm happy to stick by some of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (eg, that we might end up with a gift economy if assemblers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prove cheap and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tractable), but the vexing issue is the realistic pathway there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brutally: who pays, and why?
