I urge everyone on the list to read very closely Jeremy Rifkin's piece in the 
<BR>
LA Times that follows.  As a professional rhetorician, I find it an 
<BR>
impeccably constructed polemic, craftily designed to gently tug at the most 
<BR>
powerful negative emotional reactions to human genetic engineering.  This 
<BR>
piece wasn't just dashed off of Rifkin's word processor and he didn't write 
<BR>
it as an impulsive response to developments of the moment.  It is a coldly 
<BR>
calculated step in a plan this man and his followers are carrying out to 
<BR>
block human genetic engineering.  
<BR>
<P>If the geneticists who are doing the work that will save our lives don't get 
<BR>
down out of their ivory towers RIGHT NOW and take these people on in the 
<BR>
media, we're all going to be pretty damned disappointed.

<P>Cloning: What Hath Genomics Wrought?
<BR>
&nbsp;Britain patents 'Dolly process' on animals. Early-stage human embryos are
<BR>
'inventions' too.
<BR>
<P><P>By JEREMY RIFKIN
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, a great change in history comes about quickly and without
<BR>
warning, transforming the very way we perceive ourselves and the world
<BR>
around us for generations to come. Such was the case when the world first
<BR>
heard about Dolly the cloned sheep. Now, Ian Wilmut, the Scottish scientist
<BR>
who cloned Dolly, has made history a second time, and the new development is
<BR>
likely to have an even greater impact on the world than the first.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British patent office has just granted Wilmut's Roslin Institute
<BR>
patents on his cloning process and all animals cloned using the process. The
<BR>
patents have been licensed to Geron Corp., a California-based biotech
<BR>
company. There is something more, however. The patent also includes as
<BR>
intellectual property--i.e., patented inventions--all cloned human embryos
<BR>
up to the blastocyst stage, which is a cluster of about 140 cells. For the
<BR>
first time, a national government has declared that a specific human being
<BR>
created through the process of cloning is, at its earliest phase of
<BR>
development, to be considered an invention in the eyes of the patent office.
<BR>
The implications are profound and far-reaching.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was less than 135 years ago that the United States abolished
<BR>
slavery, making it illegal for any human being to own another human being as
<BR>
property after birth. Now the British patent office has opened the door to a
<BR>
new era in which a developing human being can be owned, in the form of
<BR>
intellectual property, in the gestational stages between conception and
<BR>
birth.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of where people may stand on the question of abortion, one
<BR>
would think that everyone would be shocked at the idea that a company might
<BR>
be able to own a human embryo as an invention.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents, when they read about this extraordinary patent decision,
<BR>
should ask themselves whether their children and future generations will be
<BR>
well served ethically if they grow up in a world where they come to think of
<BR>
embryonic human life as intellectual property, controlled by life science
<BR>
companies. What happens to our children's most basic notions about the
<BR>
distinctions between human life and inanimate objects when the former comes
<BR>
to be regarded by law as mere inventions, simple utilities to be bartered
<BR>
like so many commodities in the commercial arena?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if cloned human embryos are, in fact, considered to be human
<BR>
inventions, then what becomes of our notion of God, the creator? What will
<BR>
future generations say when their children ask, where do babies come from?
<BR>
Will they say they are the inventions of scientists and the property of life
<BR>
science companies?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geron makes the point that it has no intention of cloning a
<BR>
full-birthed human being, but only wants to use cloned human embryos as
<BR>
research tools. Still, this breathtaking patent marks the first commercial
<BR>
step into a brave new world of human reproductive technology and designer
<BR>
babies, where gestational human life becomes subject to ownership and
<BR>
commercial exploitation in ways that challenge our very notions of what it
<BR>
means to be a human being. It is possible that in the not-too-distant future
<BR>
parents will order up their children the way they buy other products, making
<BR>
babies the ultimate shopping experience in a post-modern world.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geron and the life science companies would argue that without patents
<BR>
they would not have the financial incentives to provide cures to deadly
<BR>
diseases and improve human health. Yet the question arises: What is wrong
<BR>
with an economic system in which advancing the human condition depends on
<BR>
allowing a few commercial enterprises exclusive right to claim cloned human
<BR>
embryos as their intellectual property?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years, genomic companies have been engaged in a fierce
<BR>
battle to locate, isolate, define and patent plant, animal and human genes,
<BR>
the raw resources of the coming biotech century. Now, with the British
<BR>
patent office making the first stages of human life a patented invention, a
<BR>
new, even more ominous threshold has been crossed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, the groundwork is being laid for redefining the building
<BR>
blocks of life--the genes, the chromosomes, the cells, the organs, the
<BR>
tissues and now cloned human embryos--as private property, exploitable in
<BR>
the biological market place. Where will this journey end?
