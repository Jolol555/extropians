<P>It was professor Peter Singer of Princeton.  There's some information
<BR>
(mixed in with other news) at <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/99/c/1013.htm">http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/99/c/1013.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Quoting from the above page, here's the story in a nutshell:
<BR>
<P>-----
<BR>
Badgered by protests and calls for his dismissal, Princeton University
<BR>
bioethicist Peter Singer on Tuesday night defended his position supporting
<BR>
euthanasia of disabled infants.
<BR>
The 53-year-old Australian scholar's most controversial works support a
<BR>
parent's right to euthanize severely handicapped infants.
<BR>
<P>Speaking at a debate, Singer said his arguments often are misinterpreted
<BR>
and that he does not support policies that require infanticide in cases of
<BR>
severe disability. He said doctors and parents should agree to any decision.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Killing an infant is not equivalent to killing a person, because by a
<BR>
person I mean something more of a rational, self-aware being,&quot; Singer said.
<BR>
<P>Campus security guards surrounded the packed auditorium while Singer
<BR>
debated Adrienne Asch, a blind Wellesley College professor of human
<BR>
reproduction. Six anti-Singer protesters, one in a wheelchair, stood
<BR>
outside the campus gates wearing signs that read,&quot;Singer and Hitler: Great
<BR>
together.&quot;
