<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;FBI Database of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [Note *1995*....]
</EM><BR>
<P>he did the study in 1997, at the behest of Handgun Control Inc (HCI)
<BR>
because they were convinced that the 'shall-issue' concealed carry laws
<BR>
that were being passed in many states in the 1988-92 period were causing
<BR>
crime to go up. He discovered that it was the reverse, which they didn't
<BR>
want to beleive, they took him to court and got an injunction against
<BR>
him ever mentioning that they had originally hired him. They didn't pay
<BR>
him for the work, and he had to come out with the book in order to
<BR>
recoupe the costs of the study. HCI went apopleptic over his release of
<BR>
his study, and hired some of their best zombies to claim that his study
<BR>
was 'flawed' (when they never read the study), and announced that since
<BR>
his professorship position at the University of Chicago had been
<BR>
originally endowed by the Olin Foundation, and that that Olin
<BR>
Corporation makes guns (when the two are not related), that he was
<BR>
'biased.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not even remotely close to &quot;undeniable.&quot;  Sure everyone knows that crime has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been steadily decreasing recently.  *Nothing* I have ever seen attributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this trend to the large number of guns circulating in society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe it was mentioned on the list a month or two ago (perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before Mike returned), but not particularly well discussed, that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current working academic theory (albeit a very controversial one),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circa *1999*, is that the decline in &quot;crime&quot; in recent years correlates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly with the legalization of abortion.  Fewer unwanted children --&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fewer criminals, nothing to do with guns at all, entirely a sociological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomena.
</EM><BR>
<P>The rise in youth violence can also be tied to the rise in use of SSRIs
<BR>
by children, and it can be tied to the rise in inner city welfare
<BR>
populations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, just to balance the discussion, I've seen &quot;statements&quot; to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect, that the rash of youth violence in recent times is not a change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the actual incidence but a change in the reporting by news hungry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensationalistic media.  Where adultery and children running amok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were once &quot;private&quot; issues, they have now become fodder for public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voyerism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very much so. Ask the average person, and they will insist that there
<BR>
have been more school shootings this past year than ever before. Fact is
<BR>
that there were fewer such incidents than ever before, and if it weren't
<BR>
for the Columbine incident, there would have been fewer deaths on school
<BR>
grounds than ever before. The gun controllers insist this isn't true,
<BR>
but they are also the same people that insist on defining a 'child' as
<BR>
anyone 25 or under.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this premise, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of Congress) to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and enact laws that can keep people from suing the gun manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are highly misguided.  [I might be willing to grandfather certain very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old weapons, but modern day products should be engineered to be safe.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You can engineer computers to be protected from misuse by use of the
<BR>
very circuitry the computer is made up of. To protect a gun from misuse,
<BR>
you will need to install a computer on the gun, that is small enough,
<BR>
power supply and all, to not impede the use of the gun. Current research
<BR>
models are projected to add a minimum of $1000.00 to the cost of each
<BR>
gun if put in production, which also decreases their reliability, as gun
<BR>
recoil is NOT something that electronics are particularly good at
<BR>
dealing with on a frequent basis, and compact power supplies are
<BR>
notoriously short lived. Additionally, such technology limits the gun's
<BR>
use to the OWNER. Other family members or employees would not be able to
<BR>
use them.
