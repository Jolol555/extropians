<P>
<EM>&gt;My grandfather told me the two very most important skills for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any young man to have are: auto mechanics and self defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OK.  One has been marginally useful, mostly as a hobby,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other totally useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dear Spike,
<BR>
<P>I don't think these are at all useless, in both the smaller
<BR>
picture and the larger picture.
<BR>
<P>In the smaller picture, taking _literally_ what your grandfather
<BR>
said, if you learn the details of your mode of transportation and
<BR>
if you learn how to protect yourself, the world is open to you
<BR>
to explore, and you can explore with an added confidence that
<BR>
you are equipped to handle many situations.
<BR>
<P>In my early 20s (I'm 38 now), I took apart my bicycle because
<BR>
I thought that it needed an overhaul, and that was the start of
<BR>
thousands of miles of travelling in the next 15 years on my
<BR>
bicycle, visiting new places. And I don't even think that I'm
<BR>
a very mechanical person either (my mountain bicycle now with
<BR>
it's various sealed components are still a mystery to me).
<BR>
The process of putting my bicycle together from its pieces and
<BR>
then being totally dependent on it and myself, in strange foreign
<BR>
places did more (and still does) for my confidence than anything
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, the self defense skills, and the learning process
<BR>
for that, I consider very important, not only because you
<BR>
learn to rely on yourself, but because the skills (can) teach
<BR>
you methods for interacting with the rest of the world. The
<BR>
Aikido that I learned some years ago taught me ways to
<BR>
&quot;be present&quot; that I still find valuable every day. The other
<BR>
self-defense courses I took in my 20s showed me simple ways
<BR>
to be aware of my environment and some ways to take care of
<BR>
myself, if I find myself in a bad situation. (I also owned
<BR>
a gun and learned how to use that, until my old repetitive
<BR>
strain injury stopped my ability to practice regularly, and
<BR>
so I sold it.)
<BR>
<P>I think that your gradfather was right on target too, if you
<BR>
take a step back and see a larger picture for what you learn with
<BR>
auto mechanics and self-defense: learning self-reliance
<BR>
and self-responsibility. Whatever activities a parent can
<BR>
find for encouraging and supporting these traits in their
<BR>
kids will have long-lasting effects. I'm not a parent now, but
<BR>
I'm still a kid at heart, and I remember quite vividly the
<BR>
activities that my parents supported that put me out in the world
<BR>
in good ways, being responsible for my actions (making lots of
<BR>
mistakes, of course), and relying on myself.
<BR>
<P>Finally, if I wish to add one thing to the 1) self-reliance and
<BR>
2) self-responsibility ideas to try to teach to one's kids:
<BR>
don't be afraid to be alone. There will be times in ones life when
<BR>
one's own convictions and choices and values puts one apart
<BR>
from those others around you. So don't be afraid and trust yourself.
<BR>
