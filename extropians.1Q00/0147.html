</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, but most of the books of the New Testament were letters 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written by Paul, who never met Christ.  The Gospel of Luke, and its
</EM><BR>
sequel, The  Acts of the Apostles were also written long after Jesus
<BR>
died, as was The 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Revelation (Apocalypse) of John.  Only three of the Gospels even claim
</EM><BR>
to have 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; any association with Apostles of Christ, and the best evidence is that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they were oral traditions written down 50-150 years afterward.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes, Paul converted to Christianity a couple of years after Christ was
<BR>
killed, after he had been dispatched to Damascus to put down a Christian
<BR>
community which he subsequently joined, but it might be fair to say that
<BR>
he was a contemporary of Jesus, was closely associated with the some of
<BR>
the earliest Christians, and was able to recount the life and teachings
<BR>
of Jesus.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi (religious teacher),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would like to see some evidence of this.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I can't provide a specific quotation from a Jewish authority, but it is
<BR>
not surprising to me that he could be called a Rabbi, since he was a Jew
<BR>
who instructed Jews on religious matters, and had many followers, which
<BR>
is pretty much the definition of a Rabbi.  A controversial Rabbi, to be
<BR>
sure.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many prophets who came 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before&gt; Mohammed,&gt; &gt; the Seal of the Prophets (the last prophet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mohammed was born around 570AD, and died around 632AD.  The writings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attributed to him occurred after that date, over 600 years after 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstrom 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Even though Mohammed lived centuries after Jesus, it would not preclude
<BR>
Jesus being recognized by Muslims as a prophet.  The holy building called
<BR>
the Kabaa, which looks like a black cube, located in the center of the
<BR>
religious compound at Mecca, was built by Abraham (according to legend),
<BR>
so that suggests that Islam reveres Abraham, who long pre-dates Jesus,
<BR>
and who is part of the Jewish tradition.  The Muslims call Jews and
<BR>
Christians 'People of the Book', meaning that Jews and Christians adhere
<BR>
to the holy scriptures which pre-date the Koran, and Muslims allow that
<BR>
Jews and Christians worship the one true God.  That suggests that Muslims
<BR>
respect the scriptures of the Christians and the Jews, just as Christians
<BR>
respect at least some of the scriptures of the Jews.  I don't have a copy
<BR>
of the Koran, much less one with an index, so I can't easily look up
<BR>
whether any mention Jesus actually appears in the Koran.
