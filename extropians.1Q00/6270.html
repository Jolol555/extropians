</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lets look at the number of cameras in a total ubiquitous open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance system:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Range of average camera(at useful resolution): 50 m radius
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Field of view: 90 degrees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Area under surveillance by 1 camera: ~7500 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Area of dry surface of Earth: 148,300,000 square kilometers or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 14,830,000,000,000,000 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Number of cameras necessary to cover every square meter of the dry land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the planet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras,
</EM><BR>
<P>But the vast majority of those cameras would be pointing at a place where
<BR>
there aren't any humans, vehicles or robots and so would be worthless. A
<BR>
fairly universal surveillance system (obviously I agree no system will be
<BR>
perfect) could get by with a tiny fraction of that number of cameras,
<BR>
particularly if the cameras are mobile.  As for cost, already today you can
<BR>
get an (admittedly rubbish quality) web-cam for less than £50, and at that
<BR>
price it wouldn't be exhorbitantly expensive to have every room in your
<BR>
house under surveillance. (You may be relieved to hear that I don't have any
<BR>
plans to start webcasting Meonthetoilet.com any time soon :)
<BR>
<P>If that level of surveillance is possible today, I don't think it's a huge
<BR>
stretch to postulate a future system which could cover not just your house,
<BR>
but also shops, businesses, public areas etc and at significantly higher
<BR>
quality than the best available  today. Sure, if you decide to go hiking in
<BR>
the middle of nowhere there won't be any cameras, apart from those you bring
<BR>
with you (or ones which follow you if we soup up the tech a bit).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; which if you treat each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camera as a network device on an internet like system, would require a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network a minimum of approximately 150,000 times larger than the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worldwide internet (but only if you have nothing BUT cameras on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network, no servers, routers, or clients), and is 20 times greater than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the capacity of the IP number system's maximum capacity.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, I think your numbers may be inflated with a lot of redundant
<BR>
cameras, but even if they're not, I wouldn't like to bet against the future
<BR>
existance of a network 150,000 times the size of today's net. Lucent have
<BR>
already made a cable which could accomodate all of North America's voice and
<BR>
(I think) data traffic at once.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routers and clients for each of the 6 billion members of the human race,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this should add at least another 50 billion IP addresses to the network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assuming that you can put a couple thousand cameras on one router, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one server can handle a million or so cameras at once.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now lets say we use Zero's Rules as a filtration protocol, recapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Notify me whenever:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) someone accesses any of my banking data;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) one of my listed sworn enemies (a) purchases a weapon (b) comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 200 yards of my person (c) comes within two blocks of my house (d)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;accesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any of my data or (e) speaks my name; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) anyone is watching me by remote surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) seems to be pretty easy, and is more of a network/database function
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a camera function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) The enemies list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) purchases a weapon: unless you have evidence that shows a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat of imminent harm, then I don't see how you could claim a right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this information, however, it is easily obtainable enough by adding some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reporting functions to the NICS database system already in place. In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance of private sales, any video footage showing a gun in a 2 foot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proximity to an 'enemy' would be sufficient, assuming that the weapon in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question actually looks like a weapon, and that the system is capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delineating between dinner knives and a combat knife, a pen and a pen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun, a hand raised in greeting and a hand poised to strike, a walking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cane or a beating cane (or a cane with concealed sword or gun), and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to xray a person and determine if the person has a weapon concealed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their person...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) comes within 200 yds of Zero's person: This is less difficult than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitoring all cameras, so long as your system knows your GIS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coordinates at all times, and the GIS coordinates of all enemies at all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times, video feeds would only be neccessary to make sure that its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually an enemy and not someone wearing the enemies ID chipset in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort to confuse and bollux up your complex defense network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) much like (b), only a limited number of cameras need to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; d) accesses any of my data: This is a toughie, because you really have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no idea where in the world any of 'your data' is at any gien moment, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you really have no control over what other people do with 'your data'. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may query your bank info once, then resell it a million times through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encrypted channels, unless you want to do away with encryption as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (not likely to happen).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e) speaks my name: Ok, then we are adding microphone devices to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network, so the number of IP addy's needed is now double what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculated for just video feed, and you need voice recognition software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is totally foolproof with all languages and accents and speech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impediments ( plus you'll need video sign language translators that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read the couple dozen different sign languages), AND these applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will need to be context sensitive to be able to discriminate between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone actually referring to you, and someone giving a mathematics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lecture, or reading a comic book aloud...
</EM><BR>
<P>I basically agree with most of this, but I think you're attacking a bit of a
<BR>
straw man in e).  The system wouldn't have to be totally perfect to at least
<BR>
have a reasonable chance of catching your name, particularly if it only has
<BR>
to monitor your &quot;sworn enemies list&quot;.  In fact this is possible today - if
<BR>
you can persuade your sworn enemies to permanently wear a radio mike linked
<BR>
up to a computer with the latest speech-to-text software.

<BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Anyone who is watching you by remote surveillance: relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible, as with microtechnology, 'remote surveillance' could be any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bug, bird, etc. that doesn't need to be on your perfect network, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would need to be able to trace their line of sight communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (another physical impossibility) to their own encrypted private network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; break their encryption, and track the signals to the GIS coordinates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through any number of other devices or networks that would be stripping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and counterfeiting ID data on the packets, of one of your enemies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But given the technology required for universal surveillance, it should
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comparatively easy for everyone to have a gizmo strapped to their wrist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; monitoring vital functions which would trigger an alarm (and nearby
</EM><BR>
cameras)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the event of their demise. Any murderer would be caught &quot;on tape&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; police would converge on the location immediately. Even if some kind of
</EM><BR>
slow
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; poison was used, you could simply rewind the video from the victim's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personal camera, find the point when their food was tampered with and
</EM><BR>
again,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nail the murderer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
He added:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; First you are assuming that a camera with 360 degree field of view in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both the x/y and x/z coordinate planes would have sufficient resolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to record that info, that the persons system would not have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pre-emptively EMPed by a person wishing to do them harm, and that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person wishing to do them harm is either trackable by their own unit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which they likely won't be wearing) or identifiable in video.
</EM><BR>
<P>To carry on the poisoner example, Let's say the poisoner is president of the
<BR>
Magic Circle (and therefore adept at slight of hand, used to concealing
<BR>
things from cameras and a master of disguise). He slips something in my food
<BR>
as the waiter brings it from the restaurant's kitchen.  Despite all this,
<BR>
the fact that he walked right past my plate just before I was served (and
<BR>
then keeled over dead after my first bite) would be registered by the Crime
<BR>
Analysis Computer. The CAC could then rewind the tape, tracking his
<BR>
movements backwards (perhaps over several cameras, or via his own personal
<BR>
camera(s) until the point when he's putting on his fiendishly clever
<BR>
disguise, identify him and send round the cops. (Or if it's looking at
<BR>
historical footage, fast forward whilst tracking him to his current
<BR>
location). Obviously it's all a bit late for me personally, but the very
<BR>
high probability of retribution is likely to be an effective deterant to the
<BR>
committing of the dastardly deed in the first place.
<BR>
<P>As for EMP and most other camera disabling technologies (all those where the
<BR>
network knows the camera has been disabled), presumably this would trigger
<BR>
immediate alarms, which would probably cause me to, at the very least, stop
<BR>
eating and be on my guard (and probably take further defensive action if I
<BR>
was the sort of person to have a sworn enemies list :). In any case I would
<BR>
presume that the act of disabling a camera in a public place (or on someone
<BR>
else's property) would itself be a crime and footage just prior to the zap
<BR>
would probably be enough to identify the zapper (or at least place them on
<BR>
the scene).
<BR>
<P>Also, if the technology was good enough to have a personal mobile camera
<BR>
covering everyone then anyone who disabled their own camera (prior to a
<BR>
crime) would be inviting suspicion and might automatically be tracked by
<BR>
other cameras as they pass. Yeah, we're talking a lot of computing power and
<BR>
memory (but hands up anyone who doesn't think future capabilities in these
<BR>
areas won't dwarf today's).
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, I'm not saying that this kind of surveillance capability
<BR>
doesn't make me uncomfortable, but if such a system manages to prevent some
<BR>
religious nut from wiping out humanity before I can grow a diamond
<BR>
space-ship and head for my nano-engineered asteroid utopia then the
<BR>
(admittedly big) bad points might be worth it.

<EM>&gt; The system is part of a controlled gate system, so the person always has

</EM><BR>
<P>If current systems can recognise (even somewhat disguised) faces head on and
<BR>
at a certain distance, it doesn't seem a great leap to imagine future
<BR>
systems which have a 3d scan of the criminal (or whoever) and can recognise
<BR>
them from the side, in motion and wearing a false nose. Again the system
<BR>
won't be perfect but I think it could get pretty reliable. - there's already

software which can recognise people solely by the way they walk (and I
<BR>
understand it's fairly hard to fool).

more vulnerable to such attacks.
