<P>&nbsp;Damien Broderick
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry to keep banging on about this, but I'm deep into revisions, updates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and expansions of my book THE SPIKE, for publication in the USA later this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year. I'm try to address some of the critical objections to v. 1.0,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially certain complaints that the economics (implicit and explicit)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were handwaving and/or naive. I'm happy to stick by some of what I wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (eg, that we might end up with a gift economy if assemblers prove cheap
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; tractable), but the vexing issue is the realistic pathway there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brutally: who pays, and why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's what I've sketched in draft. It's thin as it stands. I'd welcome
</EM><BR>
any
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exact analytical commentary, either on or off list. If my terminology is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong, tell me. Urls to papers that have addressed these issues would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially welcome. If anyone knows Dr Drexler or his associates and
</EM><BR>
wishes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to pass this along for their commentary, feel free to do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I know this thread will immediately turn into a blistering debate on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of the Buddha's views of spacetime, or the sociobiology of sport,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I really would welcome some focussed reaction. We've got to get these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas out there, people, and I have a nice window right now. I would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make sure that what I'm saying is as informed and accurate as possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And as Prof Robin will tell you, I'm no economist.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ==================
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In what follows, `minting' is a user-friendly synonym for MNT, molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ==================
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once you have a working matter compiler, you can share out the job of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing the programs to a hundred million nano hackers on the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Today, computer enthusiasts write reams of code and post it for free, or
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; shareware--just for the pleasure of it, for the art, to show how good they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are, to earn the esteem of their peers. Increasingly, vast code structures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the operating system Linux are `open source', freely available for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elaboration by a host of enthusiasts who participate in their development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and evolution. MP3 digital music is increasingly available on the Web, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while the record companies were nervous at first, they are adapting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learning to make money even when music of every kind is running free. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future enthusiasts will be up all night coding ever more subtle and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cunning Killer Apps for the mint, selling them from garage start-ups
</EM><BR>
(until
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the code pirates sell the CD-Roms at a 99 percent discount, or generously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; steal and re-post your code on the net), or, like the graffiti tagger kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did back in the 20th century, finding street glory by sending their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications out instantly onto the net as shareware and freeware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reality check--hard economics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We need to pause here and take a breath. Who is supposed to be funding
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; leap into future technology, especially when its end result is a new kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of productivity that bites the hand that feeds it? Grant for the sake of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument that Drexler's trajectory of development is not impossible, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it makes quite a lot of sense. Somebody starts with first-stage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; molecular nano-technology in the lab, and step by step a new industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emerges, culminating in fourth-stage or mature minting. Each of those
</EM><BR>
steps
<BR>
<EM>&gt; needs to have its independent economic rationale. Corporations and private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investors must be convinced that their money will earn a good return--a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better return than if it were put into hamburger franchises or real
</EM><BR>
estate.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yet how can they sensibly arrive at that conclusion if the extravagant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utopian dreams of nano's more vocal enthusiasts have any validity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To put the matter crudely: putting your nest egg into nanotechnology, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be said, would be like investing in a machine that could counterfeit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money, or turn lead into gold. Even if counterfeiting where not a crime,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine the inflationary consequences. Well, of course, in a way the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post-World War Two western economies and their banking systems have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly such machines, pumping out paper money that is issued as a promise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against endless future growth. So far, with a hiccup or two, the global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economy has done quite well under this shaky fiction or non-stop juggling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; act. That's because technology really has managed to produce more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the same amount of effort.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Barry Jones saw how things were going in the micro-electronics end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economy, and in Sleepers, Wake! put his finger on what will also drive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development of minting. Miniaturisation, he notes:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permits an exponential rise in output together with an exponential fall in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total inputs--energy, labor, capital, space and time. In economic history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no remote equivalent to this... This overturns the folk-wisdom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that for every advantage there is a corresponding disadvantage or price to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be paid (`You can't have your cake and eat it too').
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cybernetics theorist of the 1950s, Norbert Wiener, foresaw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer-controlled automation as a kind of equivalent to slave labor, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hence supposed that human workers in competition with these machines would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be driven into ruinous slave-wages themselves. That hasn't happened, by
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; large, although there is an increasingly large number of people either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without work or sequestered in part-time work for McDonald's or the local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypermart. Still, as Jones points out, Wiener's fears were misplaced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because he `failed to read economic history... Slaves don't provide
</EM><BR>
markets
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for sophisticated, diverse, personalised production. Computers break down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hierarchical work structures, providing the challenge/opportunity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual creativity.'  Even so, he acknowledges, there are victims:
</EM><BR>
those
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lacking literacy and numeracy, people simply not able to join the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `information rich'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still, all this is so only because investors can make money from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information technology and the hardware that supports it. The technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dynamic that results in the frequent doublings recorded by Moore's law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might falter if consumers suspect (as many do now) that they are paying
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; `bloatware', sloppy or massively redundant code requiring colossal extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amounts of computing grunt to do pretty much the same jobs about as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If that happens, the national and international markets for an
</EM><BR>
ever-growing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; number of small computers and their software will become exhausted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Meanwhile, the cost of refitting fabrication plants to create chips at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller and denser scales balloons. Why should canny investors choose to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move their money into the nano field if they can see, at the end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development tunnel, an even more frightening prospect: assembler machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that literally compile material objects, including more of themselves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where's the profit in that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The answer, as usual, is that the market funds investments evaluated by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variety of horizons. IBM has been profligate in funding pure research, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has reaped rich rewards. Government-funded as well as privately-endowed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; university researchers continue to pump out endless astonishing
</EM><BR>
discoveries
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and applications. Corporations such as Geron (in cancer, stem cell and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telomere research) and Zyvex and Ntech (in micro- and nanotech realms)
</EM><BR>
work
<BR>
<EM>&gt; on both immediate and long-term studies into topics that might yield truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flabbergasting outcomes eventually and in the meantime could bring more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited products to market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Recall the development curve of today's almost ubiquitous personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers, which started half a century ago as immense clunky behemoths,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passed through phases or epochs where prices dropped by consecutive orders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of magnitude so that first governments and their militaries could own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers, then huge businesses, then smaller businesses with the arrival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of spreadsheets, then secretaries and students as word-processors became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common, and now the gadgets are getting as routine as personal phones (an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even more explosive marketing phenomenon), with specialised variants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lurking under the hood of your car or running your microwave cooker. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be the same with nanotechnology. Nobody expects K-Mart assemblers to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrive overnight. By the time they do, a lot of money will have been
</EM><BR>
spent,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot more recouped, and the economics of the world will have
</EM><BR>
transitioned,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by small and large jolts, into a new equilibrium (if we are lucky) as odd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to our eyes today as the world of the Keynesian welfare state would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been to an 18th century merchant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even experts who differ with Drexler over the wilder outcomes of the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miniaturisation technology agree that nano spells immense change in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economy. Professor George M. Whitesides, Mallinckrodt Professor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chemistry at Harvard, sees nano as an extension of microelectromechanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machinery (MEMs). He notes, as we saw above, that shrinking the scale of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superconductors, say, pushes up the costs of fabrication plants. `If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want 20 percent return on investment, and you put in $10 billion, how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microwidgets do you have to sell every year for the few years that that
</EM><BR>
fab
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is the state of the art? The answer is, a lot. And people who have to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the money don't like that.'  In the immediate future, Whitesides
</EM><BR>
expects
<BR>
<EM>&gt; impacts from inexpensive microtechnology rather than nano. For example, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predicts that instead of a newspaper `you might buy a sheet of paper; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back side of it would be a battery, the front side of it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display. You read it, scroll to find reference works on it, see animated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illustrations, and when you're done, you throw it away.' But making common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumables like reusable and downloadable paper with embedded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microelectronics will provide some of the industrial base for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adventurous miniaturisations. Whitesides warns that you can't just shrink
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; machine and expect it to work. Those planning the creation of mints via a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developmental trajectory like Drexler's four stages will take that for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; granted. It will be necessary to fund each step of the molecular nano
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revolution by careful, incremental advances that are each profitable but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow the shift to the next stage as it emerges from the lab.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When that occurs, though, we really should expect to see some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extraordinary leaps. Some of the limits common to today's economics of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production and distribution will blow away. There is good news and bad in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this prognosis.
