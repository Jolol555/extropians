At 11:18 AM 3/2/2000 -0500, you wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It seems you have granted that ...  Everything we can know about ethics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *is* in principle learnable via science.  You might claim that progress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in this science will be terribly slow, or that it will stop at some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; limit to scientific progress.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, I haven't contradicted myself.  The hypothetical you offered me was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that, through some scientific process, we might predict what I would think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about ethics at the end of inquiry.  Surely, then, I can't know more about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ethics than I would know at the end of inquiry, so, you argue, everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can know about ethics is an empirical matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, if no scientific process can DO that, then everything I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about ethics is NOT an empirical matter, since we can't actually run the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experiment.  So if you agree with me that we'll never have a process like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this, then you'll be forced to agree with me that ethics cannot be done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purely empirically.
</EM><BR>
<P>To be more precise, such a science might predict your beliefs at any stage
<BR>
of a cognitive process; I see no reason to focus on some mythical &quot;end.&quot;
<BR>
And let's not get distracted by the straw-person of perfect prediction.
<BR>
It could be plenty useful if predictions were just much better than random.
<BR>
<P>And let's keep our eye on the key claim at issue: can one study ethics
<BR>
via scientific methods?  You complained that evolutionary psychology folks
<BR>
were pretending to study ethics, while instead ethics is just a different
<BR>
world; no factual statements are relevant to judging ethical statements.
<BR>
I am saying that ethics is part of science, just as other cognitive and
<BR>
social sciences are.  You *can* learn about what is right by empirical
<BR>
study.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I countered with TWO objections, the main one being the first, that, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;priori, a prediction like that is impossible.  (I'd primarily hinted at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this argument, since you seemed to agree with me that it couldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done.) To predict what I would think about ethics at the end of inquiry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the process would have to predict what I would come to believe on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basis of the answer that it would give me; in other words, it would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to predict the result of its own computation.  A priori, this can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>The standard of a science of ethics isn't the ability of it to predict
<BR>
some mythical &quot;end&quot; of ethical inquiry, any more than the standard of
<BR>
solar physics is to predict the final end of the sun, billions of years
<BR>
after humans may have vastly changed the galaxy.
<BR>
<P>You can't say that science is irrelevant if it can't predict
<BR>
perfectly.  And it is far from obvious that ethical opinion is some
<BR>
maximally opaque computation which can only be predicted by running it.
<BR>
Certainly many other things that brains do can be predicted, even though
<BR>
in principle brains could make it very hard to predict them, if they
<BR>
tried hard at it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And, unfortunately, getting close just doesn't cut it in this case, as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might in sociology, economics, or general psychology.  Knowing a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about human interaction is useful, but I already know A LITTLE about what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think about ethics (and what I'm going to think).  Knowing somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more, while potentially helpful, still won't render ethics a purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;empirical matter unless it can tell me EVERYTHING I'll think about ethics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which it can't, thanks to the problems I describe above.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're trying to make this a choice of extremes: either science must
<BR>
predict everything exactly, and do it soon damn it, or the subject (ethics)
<BR>
is just not a scientific subject; it is fundamentally different.
<BR>
This same attitude would say &quot;scientists shouldn't pretend to be
<BR>
understanding love; there's no way science could exactly predict who I
<BR>
would love at the end of the universe, since I could work hard to
<BR>
make that unpredictable.  Thus love and science are just two different
<BR>
things.&quot;
