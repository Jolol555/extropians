<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Spike, get yourself an electric bicycle engine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have three motorcycles for that purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>A bicycle with an electric engine is not just a really crap motorcycle; it's
<BR>
a really, really nice bicycle. You still pedal, you still get exercise and
<BR>
clean living fun (unless you live near the brown coal power plant that
<BR>
generates the electricity for the batteries), but you also get speed, and
<BR>
this insane satisfaction. I can never explain this satisfaction factor - the
<BR>
most sceptical people that I've met have always crumbled when they actually
<BR>
had a ride. It meets some need that we've all had since we were kids and had
<BR>
to ride really bad kids bikes up really big hills.
<BR>
<P>Actually, the engine would do well on a recumbent, and probably for long
<BR>
trips you'd have somewhere to store extra batteries (my are they ever
<BR>
heavy!).
