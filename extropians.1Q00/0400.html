</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if all of her productions were recognizable variations on a similar

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;desire and discipline or whether it is a more natural process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(akin to &quot;growing&quot;).  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think so.  Variations on a theme is in itself creative.  Even the
<BR>
slightest of variations, the most subtle nuance -- can change a perspective
<BR>
and invite an entirely new interpretation.  I have been making variations
<BR>
on a theme for years -- *evolution.*   It's perpetual.  I evolve as my work
<BR>
evolves as I evolve and the &quot;tools&quot; evolve.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When Chagall or Monet were developing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impressionistic style or Erte was doing Art Deco, it was creative,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because it had never been done before.  Today we would look at artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing similar work as technically adept but not particularly creative.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is important to recognize that a &quot;style&quot; is not without a &quot;concept&quot;.
<BR>
Impressionism is a concept of expression based on a particular intent.  The
<BR>
intent was to depict a scene in painting with emphasis on use of oils in
<BR>
relation to brush stroke, color and use of light, which would allow these
<BR>
*elements* to have an identity, rather than the &quot;image&quot; dominating the
<BR>
painting.  (i.e., Their primary object was to achieve a spontaneous,
<BR>
undetailed rendering of the world through careful representation of the
<BR>
effect of natural light on objects.)  
<BR>
<P>Musical impressionism &quot;emphasized tonal color and mood rather than formal
<BR>
structures such as the sonata and the symphony.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>This was not entirely new, as Impressionism developed from a cumulation of
<BR>
changes occurring simultaneously.  Impressionism developed from variations
<BR>
on a theme -- a style and concept -- whether in music or visual images.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would agree that desire and discipline may be useful in the communication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and recognition aspects of expressing creativity, but I question whether they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are required for &quot;creativity&quot; itself.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Creativity can be a skill acquired by desire and discipline.  A well
<BR>
balanced creativity is a combination of free association and manifestation.
<BR>
&nbsp;Otherwise, it is stuff that may, by chance, be interesting, but is more
<BR>
apt to prove viable if there is some talent behind it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would object strongly to the suggestion that the purpose of creativity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is to &quot;make things happen&quot;.  Creativity occurs every time we string
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;words together and may have no value other than our own entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I use creativity to make things happen which is its purpose for me as an
<BR>
artist. Creativity is a mechanic of the mind, and the brain uses it to make
<BR>
things happen.  Our survival is in part based on our use of creativity.
<BR>
That's why we don't stick our finger in the flame twice in a row.  We go
<BR>
*around* the fire to get what we want and such act is a product of being
<BR>
creative about the circumstances.
