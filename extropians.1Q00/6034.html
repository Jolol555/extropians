<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Its not as if the entire US population suddenly mutated in the last two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; separate from the rest of humanity. There are significant reasons why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; weight and rate of obesity is so high here, and its not medical. Part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; corn-fed diet, part is that Americans watch more TV than anyone else,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; least exercise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I am convinced that corn is very bad, and I have thrown out my pop corn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;maker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you serious?  (Sometimes irony is hard to pick up over e-mail.)  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are serious, what's so bad about popcorn?  I eat the stuff literally every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me tell you a true story. When I was in the Air Force, I was first
<BR>
stationed at McChord AFB outside Tacoma, WA, which is right next door to
<BR>
Fort Lewis. A lot of the guys in my unit would go over to the army base
<BR>
to go to the NCO club, called the Madigan Club, as they had great
<BR>
dancing and music, and didn't get the Tacoma gang banger element that so
<BR>
many other clubs in the area had to deal with (violence on a regular
<BR>
basis). A lot of army guys I knew would go to the club with their wives,
<BR>
many of whome were immigrants from Korea or the Phillipines. It was
<BR>
rather sad to see these girls, who were raised on a
<BR>
rice/pork/chicken/fish diet their whole lives, and were quite petite and
<BR>
beautiful, plump up in mere months as they shifted their diet to the
<BR>
standard american processed corn, sugar coated, diet,  to become as wide
<BR>
as they were tall....
