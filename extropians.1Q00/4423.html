<P>I came to that realization a couple of years ago, and it sure changed what I
<BR>
post.  I'm not too worried about the long run, but in the next 5-20 years
<BR>
the possibility of getting raked over the coals by some government for
<BR>
violating a law that hasn't even been passed yet is an issue of some
<BR>
concern.  Its already too late to avoid being identified as a subversive
<BR>
element, of course...
<BR>
<P>But its worse than that.  Unless really draconian privacy measures get
<BR>
enacted before the market for online personal information gets going, I'd
<BR>
expect just about anything that isn't actually secret to be easily found.
<BR>
That means credit history, purchasing history, most of the paperwork you've
<BR>
ever given the government, and probably a lot of other info I'm not thinking
<BR>
of.  Won't that be fun?
<BR>
<P>Of course, it could be a lot worse.  What if some kind soul (or repressive
<BR>
government) were to dig up a landfill and read off all the data on the
<BR>
floppy disks, hard drives and tapes that they find there?  That would be
<BR>
dirt cheap to do with modestly capable AI and robotics, after all  - and
<BR>
what percentage of 'securely erased' files would actually be unrecoverable
<BR>
to 2010-2015 era technology?
