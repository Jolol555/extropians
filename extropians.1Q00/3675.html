I'm glad these trips were so enjoyable...as they should be!  Before we had 
<BR>
kids, my wife Rochelle and I traveled extensively throughout Europe.  We 
<BR>
lived (and I worked) in Germany for 3 months, and traveled throughout Italy, 
<BR>
Greece, Scandinavia for 3 more months (the dental care, even in Deutschland 
<BR>
was medieval- people love gold crowns on their front teeth, not to mention 
<BR>
rampant gum disease throughout the 'richer countries'.  There is simply no 
<BR>
better dental care in the world than in the good ol' US of A!)  A year later, 
<BR>
we did it all over again!
<BR>
<P>But you are right- traveling- It was an absolute blast.  Imagine us having to 
<BR>
be burdened with the following weekly decisions during the weekends:  whether 
<BR>
to visit Amsterdam, or a trip down the Rhine, or visit Paris, or go to 
<BR>
Bavaria, or spend the weekend in Switzerland or Copenhagen,  etc.  Tortured 
<BR>
decisions that went on for months.  Well, someone had to do it!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, enjoy traveling, cause once the kids come, the main vacations are 
<BR>
softball, soccer, and basketball weekend tourneys throughout the state, 
<BR>
coupled with finger-licking luxury dinners at either Denny's or Burger King.  
<BR>
The past, or the present, wouldn't change one day of either!
