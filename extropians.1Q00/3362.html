<EM>&gt; From: john grigg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20rehabilitation%20versus%20punishment%20in%20a%20future%20society....&In-Reply-To=&lt;38B3156F.3A8@geocities.com&gt;">starman125@hotmail.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Stirling Westrup made some enlightened comments about how even the most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cruel and sadistic individuals in the future will be seen as &quot;sick&quot; and not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil and worthy of severe punishments as in our day.  I do feel that some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people commit heinous crimes at least partially from mental illness and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;psychological demons&quot; while others are essentially healthy and simply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose the wrong choice.
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I am 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like murder 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rape. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Same here. It is, IMHO, not more &quot;enlightened&quot; to prefer 
<BR>
treatment to punishment or vice versa, btw; morality and 
<BR>
justice are subjective and rather arbitrary matters of 
<BR>
personal preference. It would therefore be a good idea 
<BR>
if everyone could decide for him/herself (in a standard 
<BR>
legal contract) what should happen to people that do 
<BR>
damage to them or their property (within certain 
<BR>
parameters of public consensus, of course).
<BR>
<P>Especially in the case of murder such a contract 
<BR>
could solve a lot of legal/moral problems. It would 
<BR>
also be interesting to see whether people who have 
<BR>
chosen &quot;treatment&quot; or soft punishments for their 
<BR>
potential murderers would get whacked more often 
<BR>
than those who have selected tough punishments,
<BR>
btw. This assumes that one's preferences are 
<BR>
made public, of course. I can see people wearing 
<BR>
t-shirts which warn would-be assailants about the 
<BR>
hideous tortures they'll have to endure in VR Hell 
<BR>
should they kill them. Could be quite effective, 
<BR>
especially when a picture of one's favorite torture 
<BR>
device is included.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this might be a reasonable compromize for many
<BR>
people.
