<EM>&gt; Some lessons that eventually surfaced:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (a) Always have plan B and perhaps plan C (essential for Russia).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (b) There are as many sharks in America as Russia (if you look closely).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (c) There are concepts that cannot translate across cultures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (d) Knowledgeable management is crucial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (e) Never structure your business strategy towards a single primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     investor.

<EM>&gt; I walked past a woman in the metro tonight.  She had one young child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standing beside her and another infant in her arms.  The arm holding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the infants head ended in an outstretched palm.  At the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the passage was a seemingly talented flutist playing not sad, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not happy tunes.  I noticed a 10 ruble (~$.30) note in his flute case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whom should I have helped -- both, neither?  I really don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anymore.

<P>Robert,
<BR>
<P>I intended to reply, but then realized how premature that would be.
<BR>
Just stared at the monitor trying to penetrate the screen and pin
<BR>
down what was making me resonantly mute.  Borges once asked if
<BR>
there was a single word that contained the Universe.  No idea why
<BR>
I thought of that.  Just let me think about this, O.K.?
