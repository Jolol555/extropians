<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;GDP (and gross world product) if the U.S. had picked a side at random in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;the Bosnian war and bombed it than if the U.S. had done nothing.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Hmm, if so, what would are your grounds for opposing such a policy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I care about some things that aren't measured well by GDP, such as pain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death, control of one's destiny, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Pain and death should lower GWP.  I agree that in principle GWP could
<BR>
be improved to measure individual preferences for &quot;freedom&quot;, but I'm
<BR>
skeptical that this choice is close enough to the border line that
<BR>
adding freedom in would actually change the decision.  How much larger
<BR>
than the pain and death effects do you think the freedom effect would be?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;... Consider the motto &quot;Futarchy: vote values, but bet beliefs&quot;. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You spoke of giving a single agency responsibility for measuring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;objective function. Such agencies always have some ability to add their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own biases into the decisions involved in producing such indicators. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I could go for having several competing agencies measure things with the
<BR>
official measurement being some combination (e.g., median) of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I want to insure that the value decisions are made by the average person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if possible, or if that isn't possible, then by processes that the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person can understand well enough to hold accountable. I suspect that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average person will be better able to understand the value decisions being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;made if they are presented in the form &quot;bombing Serbia will increase GWP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by 0.001% and cause 100 innocent people to die&quot; than if they are presented
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the form of an objective function where the average person is asked for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinions on what numbers to use in weighting GWP versus innocent deaths.
</EM><BR>
<P>The later doesn't preclude the former.  The public is only willing to attend
<BR>
to a small fraction of decisions.  So the key is how to let the public
<BR>
control all the decisions they don't attend to.  I imagine the public using
<BR>
decisions like whether to bomb Serbia to tweak existing weights.
<BR>
<P>That is, you might see that using the current weights the decision is to
<BR>
bomb Serbia.  Since you don't like this decision, you might &quot;trace&quot; this
<BR>
decision by examining the different components, such as GWP up .001% and 100
<BR>
deaths of innocents.  You might see that increasing the weight on innocent
<BR>
deaths by 20% could tip the decision the other way, and so you might lobby
<BR>
for such a change.  The people who would oppose you are those who see this
<BR>
change reversing other decisions that they like.
<BR>
<P>Given some rough equilibrium of political pressure, the weights would settle
<BR>
down somewhere.  And the big benefit is that all the other decisions, the
<BR>
ones the public isn't willing to attend to, will be made consistently with
<BR>
the values that the public expressed in the decisions that they did attend to.
<BR>
And as usual, any large enough faction could call the public's attention to
<BR>
a particular decision they think is especially mistaken.
