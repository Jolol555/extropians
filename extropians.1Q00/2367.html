I portray my interests, often interject my humor (not always realized at the
<BR>
quick of the draw in the webworld) in some forums. But as to the clarity of
<BR>
myself online, the skeletal is there, and yet I tend to give impressions of
<BR>
shy attributes (quiet persona), however in real life, I am animated,
<BR>
exaggerated and vociferous. (ironic isn't it) It seems that one cannot fully
<BR>
comprehend a person, and often can misconstrue said words online to be a
<BR>
different connotation altogether. (as I'm sure many of you have experienced)
<BR>
As far as divulging personal information online, I'm honest, but will
<BR>
protect with ambiguous diction games when needed. Mystery can be a
<BR>
successful measure of acceptable privacy. I do reply to all stray emails
<BR>
that are sent to me via my websites, and use the previous tactic to any
<BR>
adverse questions or comments. (or use some sort of humor distraction)
<BR>
For the most part, I represent myself to the best of my ability in hopes to
<BR>
meet or hear from people with the same interests. I appreciate comments and
<BR>
visitors to my sites including those they may send via email. I also attain
<BR>
great pleasure in creating my webpages, such as in art, you can be &quot;God&quot; of
<BR>
the particular creation, and view your product with streaming validations.
<BR>
I have made some great connections thru the web, cyber bonding has been good
<BR>
to me.
<BR>
I do not have an alter ego, although I do find the combination notion
<BR>
appealing. Yet, consider that there may be some obstacles when faced with a
<BR>
real time situation if that were ever actualized. I myself want to reach out
<BR>
for myself, and as myself, (credit where credit is due if you will) Perhaps
<BR>
thats selfish?
<BR>
Web presence rocks!
<BR>
Fully addicted,
<BR>
Gina &quot;Nanogirl&quot; Miller

<BR>
&nbsp;so many of my substantial relationships have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; begun on line  that I don't misrepresent myself any more - i see everyone
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; here as a potential meat body acquaintance and they deserve to know the
</EM><BR>
real
<BR>
<EM>&gt; me  Still, I have another screen name, I act EXACTLY the same and no one
</EM><BR>
knows
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it;s me..  go figure
