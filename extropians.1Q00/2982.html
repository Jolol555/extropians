Greetings, Extropian Mailing List units. 
<BR>
<P>As you undoubtly have noticed, the ``Guns: Hate Them or Love Them'' Jihad
<BR>
members have gathered at the Extropian Mailing List again, forever
<BR>
battling over value judgements, and using up the available bandwidth.
<BR>
<P>I humble request that you refrain from joining the bandwidth killing spree.
<BR>
Remember, a number of units actually pay real world money for Internet access.
<BR>
<P>I suggest that the non-combattant units of the Extropian Mailing List
<BR>
filter away messages from the Jihad members, optionally using a quasi-
<BR>
intelligent filtering agent which identifies and terminates any Jihad
<BR>
oriented texts, so one still can read any non-Jihadic texts sent from
<BR>
the Jihad members.
<BR>
<P>The filtering program could e.g. count the use of value judgemental words
<BR>
and invectives used in a text to decide whether it should eliminate the text
<BR>
or not.
<BR>
<P>I understand such a program, which can recognize a flame war, exists already,
<BR>
and can recognize, and remove, a text which would upset the program's user.
<BR>
Unfortunately, I have no pointer stored to that program at this time.
<BR>
<P>Also, I remember that in the Olden Days one could tell the Extropian Mailing
<BR>
List software to stop sending oneself texts which matches certain criteria.
<BR>
<P>Has this functionality disappeared?
<BR>
<P>I believe that a filtering mechanism, of the kind discussed above, could have
<BR>
a certain use, and help to cool down the Jihad members to their senses, so
<BR>
they abstain from the rude list behaviour they currently display.
<BR>
<P>Flame wars lack usefulness. Avoid them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kpj
<BR>
