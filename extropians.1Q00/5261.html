<P>There is a good PBS program about Carnegie, the steel industry and all of
<BR>
the public works he did.  It isn't clear whether he was compensating for
<BR>
guilt he may have felt at taking advantage of his workers (strike breaking,
<BR>
etc.) or whether he wanted to promote education &amp; learning (since
<BR>
his empire was based to a large degree on technology and innovation)
<BR>
or whether he simply a generous individual who wanted to return
<BR>
some of what he had acquired.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What history says to me that individualistic or collectivistic societies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophies are premised on distorted perspectives of who and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human beings are. We are both social (collective) and individual so our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; societies need to reflect a similar balance which is no mean trick and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always successful, but it is none the less the most correct approch.
</EM><BR>
<P>This does of course raise very *interesting* questions as to whether,
<BR>
in the future, when humans have much higher inter-individual communication
<BR>
bandwidths, they will choose to operate more as collectives (e.g. the borg)
<BR>
and less as rugged individuals.
<BR>
<P>There is the urban wisdom, that over time, couples grow more and more
<BR>
alike (due to the shared knowledge base and experiences).  It would
<BR>
be interesting to speculate that being individuals (in fact and
<BR>
in our acts) is due entirely to the fact that I know something
<BR>
uniquely different from what you know.  If we can know what each
<BR>
other knows in a relatively short time (i.e. we can transfer your
<BR>
L1/L2/L3 cache and your long-term memory to my L1/L2/L3 cache
<BR>
and long term memory) then the entire concept of &quot;individuals&quot;
<BR>
seems to become very fuzzy.
<BR>
<P>I cannot help but conclude that in the light of rational thought and
<BR>
the experiences on which those thoughts are based, we are as one.
<BR>
Only if you have different experiences or think irrationally can
<BR>
you be an &quot;individual&quot;.
