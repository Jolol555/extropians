<EM>&gt; &gt; so that it went 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; floating off it would destabilize the earths rotation with

<EM>&gt; &gt; ugly results.... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Kinda like a tire out of balance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't know if it's so far fetched.  my personal knowledge in the matter is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nill, but i read an article in new scientist (either 28/11/1998 or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5/12/1998, can't remember) about someone proposing that 600 million years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago the earths tilt was at around 51 degrees (they were using this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justify the fact that there used to be glaciers around the equator at that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time), but since the earths tilt is &quot;known&quot; to have been around 23 degrees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 430 million years ago they needed  to find a quick way of changing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earth's tilt by that amount in that short (170 million year) period.  one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them suggested that ice formation around the current poles would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shifted the tilt by the needed amount.  the contention from other geologists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seemed to be the difficulty in the creation of the ice in the right places,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not in the maths of the tilt shift which suggests that the calculations in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that department were correct.  i'll see if i can find it again.
</EM><BR>
<P>An imbalance in the formation of ice is in fact quite
<BR>
easy and very visible today.
<BR>
<P>In the east of north America there is ice and snow in
<BR>
the winter and the weather is cold from about 40 degrees
<BR>
north. The Atlantic water is cold polar water.
<BR>
<P>In Europe there's a warm gulf stream carrying north from
<BR>
the equator. Weather in Europe is pretty decent till about
<BR>
60 degrees north. Once you get further to the north (or to
<BR>
the east, away from the Atlantic), you'll get to experience
<BR>
`real' winter.
<BR>
<P>That's a difference of about 20 degrees, or 2500 km. If for
<BR>
some reason (vulcanic activity in the atlantic that forms
<BR>
new mountains and disrupts the flow of water) the difference
<BR>
would become any bigger, we could start wobbling in a pretty
<BR>
short time period.
<BR>
<P>In fact, some people believe that we had such a wobble at the
<BR>
end of the last ice age, some 12500 years ago. This is still
<BR>
a controversial thing but there's anecdotal and geological
<BR>
evidence pointing to some pretty devastating events back then.
<BR>
Then again, there's other geological evidence suggesting that
<BR>
nothing of that magnitude happened and that the end of the ice
<BR>
age wasn't that spectacular at all.
<BR>
