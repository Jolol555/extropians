</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;I have read many of the posts on this thread and I'm mind boggled.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;if we are really talking about having some money to do something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;courageous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;with — what do you want to do? Live or die?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;I call it a war on death.  The best defense is a cultural offense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yeah sure spreading longevity propaganda is a good idea.  But I think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have a hard time getting John &amp; Jane Public to get on board until we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;eliminate (or at least substantially reduce) world poverty and hunger.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mean the obvious response is: &quot;What?!?  There are *millions* of starving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people in the world who don't have access to decent medical care, potable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;water or residential and communication infrastructures and you want us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;work on giving them indefinite life spans?  Are you mad?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have a different opinion.  Whether or not anyone thinks investing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extreme life extension is an inappropriate allocation of monies makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little difference in the long term.  People once thought that a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guys who wanted to fly airplanes were mad.  Those madmen became heros who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;persisted in their dream.  Today we benefit from it — but flying airplanes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was just a mere ambition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think anybody thought the Wright Bros. (I assume that's who you were 
<BR>
referring to) were mad.  In fact there were others during and before their 
<BR>
time who had also attempted flight, but with much less success.  But I agree 
<BR>
with what I think is your main point--that if some independent lab or 
<BR>
research group were to come up with the fountain of youth the world would 
<BR>
beat a path to their door.  Problem is the resources needed to cure death 
<BR>
seem to be well outside the reach of any independent lab or group of 
<BR>
independently funded researchers.  Granted I could be wrong, but I do 
<BR>
believe that in order to get that job done, you are going to have to court 
<BR>
traditional sources of research funding, and that means holding out your 
<BR>
palms to good old Uncle Sam.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But, let's not divert from the central question originally posed to us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which was:  &quot;What bold endeavors do you wish you could see funded in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next decade?&quot;  I'm not so concerned about what anyone thinks when I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carefully considering one important problem regarding the well being of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humankind and what I would do to help humankind overcome it.  As such, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use of the money would be to *increase the well being of humankind.*  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better way to philanthropically bestow well being than to overcome disease
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and death -- whether it be through uploading, cryonics, AI, genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering, nanotechnology, etc.  (Personally, I do not believe that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be any one isolated avenue but a combination of many fields.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In that the pools of money originally referred to was in part from &quot;(1) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;estimated fifteen trillion dollars that baby boomers stand to inherit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the World War II generation,&quot; the baby boomers are most definitely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interested and involved in basic areas life extension.  Cosmetic surgery,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fitness routines and lean figures may seem very mundane, but multi-track
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and see these boomers a decade up the road and they will be lined up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics, and then a few more decades up the road and they may be lined up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have their brains uploaded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also,  the word &quot;endeavors&quot; is plural and there is no reason why you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feed the world with your $100 million.  I'd take the billions and free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone from the prison of death.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, hey I'm down with that.  If somebody said &quot;Give me a $100 million and 
<BR>
I'll cure death&quot; they'd have my $100 million in a heartbeat.  By the same 
<BR>
token if someone said &quot;Give *me* a $100 million and I'll end hunger and 
<BR>
poverty&quot; they'd have my money in the same heartbeat.  Problem is nobody is 
<BR>
saying either one.  So today, if I had a $100 million, I guess I'd give it 
<BR>
to Foresight.
