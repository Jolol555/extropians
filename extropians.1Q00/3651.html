<EM>&gt; Let me try again. I have a couple of motley colored designer gummi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bears, which I drop into a big beaker of cold water.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I bring the solution to the boil. Soon after I have a homogenous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gelatine solution, all traces about the gummibear's original shape and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coloration erased. Now time stops in the beaker. Freeeeeze. 256 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later, time resumes, and the system is given advanced (but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Omega-grade) future intelligences for analysis and reconstruction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which information is still present about the shape and distribution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coloration of the original gummi bears? Would the type of technique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used for reconstruction influence the result a lot?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, a good reconstruction could tell you the exact mass of each flavor of
<BR>
gummy bear that was originally present, but that's about it.  This seems to
<BR>
be a very close analogy to the case of a brain being dissolved in acid.
<BR>
However:
<BR>
<P>Suppose, instead, that we subject the gummy bears to a different series of
<BR>
insults.  First we expose them to a series of reactants that break down the
<BR>
dyes that give them their color. Then we cool them to 0 C, neatly dice them
<BR>
into lots of tiny gummy bits, and preserve the resulting pile of discolored
<BR>
fragments in liquid nitrogen.  Can we reconstruct the original shape and
<BR>
color of the gummy bears?
<BR>
<P>If we don't know that it started out as a pile of gummy bears, probably not.
<BR>
If, however, we know what happened, it isn't even all that hard.  You can
<BR>
tell the color of a gummy bear fragment by recognizing the reaction products
<BR>
left over from its de-coloring, and you can fit the pieces back together
<BR>
based on their shape.
<BR>
<P>Now, I think that the case of cryopreservation is a lot closer to my example
<BR>
than yours.  Typical slides of preserved tissue show a bewildering jumble of
<BR>
mixed-up parts, not a homogeneous sludge.  In this kind of situation the
<BR>
quality of your repair techniques has a very large impact on your ability to
<BR>
do a reconstruction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is not about pessimism at all. You aren't an engineer, are you?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm a software engineer - and yes, that is a very different thing than being
<BR>
a programmer.  But that's another thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I use a true random generator (or a pseudorandom generator unknown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to you) to scramble the picture, information is lost. Period.
</EM><BR>
<P>No kidding.  I've said that several times myself.  There's no need to keep
<BR>
beating a dead horse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are surely aware that the position you question are held by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only specialists in the matter there are? There are no better ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet. What are your credentials in the matter? Programmer, aren't you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, the argument from authority.  Does this mean you don't have actual data
<BR>
on hand?
<BR>
<P>There are no specialists on brain reconstruction.  Neurobiology,
<BR>
conventional medicine and cryopreservation are all only tangentially
<BR>
related.  Asking a specialist in one of these fields about reconstruction
<BR>
techniques is like asking a paint-and-canvas artist about digital image
<BR>
processing.  Heck, most 'experts' still seem to think that clinical death
<BR>
and the capacity for spontaneous recovery are meaningful yardsticks here.
<BR>
<P>The only group that even tries to understand the real situation are the few
<BR>
pioneers who do cryopreservation research for the cryonics organizations,
<BR>
and they haven't had the time, funding or manpower to create the kind of
<BR>
well-supported body of experience that would allow them to become a real
<BR>
specialty.  Besides, the last I heard they were cautiously optimistic except
<BR>
when they're asking for money.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, the people whose opinions I most respect in this regard
<BR>
unanimously hold the same position I do.  The only difference between my
<BR>
claim and the comments that Drexler, Merkle et. al. make is that I left out
<BR>
the minimal qualifiers that scientists habitually attach to any statement of
<BR>
fact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So we assume a best case as default. No further research needs to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done, because the information Is Still In There, Somehow.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, we take past experience as our guide.  Finding ways to computationally
<BR>
unscramble mangled structures is so common that we should expect it to
<BR>
happen as a matter of course whenever someone decides to devote some real
<BR>
effort to any given problem.  If you don't think it can be done in this
<BR>
particular case, you need to actually show that the necessary information
<BR>
does not exist.
<BR>
<P>Which brings me back to the point you've been ignoring.  The fact that a
<BR>
structure 'appears' scrambled says nothing about its actual information
<BR>
content.  The fact that cremation and long-term decomposition cause
<BR>
irreversible damage is easy to demonstrate, but the same is not true of less
<BR>
severe insults that leave substantial amounts of structure intact.  So, do
<BR>
you have any actual experimental evidence regarding the degree of
<BR>
information loss caused by various forms of trauma?  Failing that, do you
<BR>
have a good logical argument for believing that the information loss is
<BR>
catastrophic?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; 2) Every repair scheme I've ever heard of relies on massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computing power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; and very limited intelligence.  This is totally unrealistic.  We should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This sentence makes no sense. It is also pure fabrication.
</EM><BR>
<P>You need to calm down and start actually reading me before you reply.  Look
<BR>
at Drexler's scenario in Engines of Creation for a typical example of what
<BR>
I'm talking about.  You've got a bazillion MIPS of computing power being
<BR>
used to run something that sounds like a mating between a molecular CAD
<BR>
program and an expert system.  I understand why he didn't want to spend
<BR>
another 50 pages getting the reader fully up to speed on what is really
<BR>
possible, but his brief references to engineering AI go right past most
<BR>
people without ever making an impression.
<BR>
<P>Certainly, there are people around who know better.  Drexler is one of them,
<BR>
and so are most of the other big names in nanotech.  But most people (even a
<BR>
lot of extropian and transhumanist types) are still thinking in terms of a
<BR>
program that shuffles atoms using algorithms that any good programmer could
<BR>
implement.
<BR>
<P>That is not even remotely realistic.  What they should be imagining is
<BR>
something more like the FBI working over an especially important crime
<BR>
scene, only with even more layers of specialized knowledge and processing.
<BR>
The degree of expertise that can be applied to solving each particular
<BR>
sub-problem (membrane reassembly, oxidation reversal, etc.) will grow
<BR>
steadily over time, and it is difficult to say exactly where it will reach
<BR>
its limits.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see many problems in getting frozen, a number of precautions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assuming. I see a lot more problems in staying frozen, mostly because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of above attitudes. &quot;What, me worry?&quot; hits too close to the mark for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfort.
</EM><BR>
<P>What on Earth does an argument about the quality of current suspensions have
<BR>
to do with the long-term stability of cryonics organizations?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; nonsense.  Most cryonicists do in fact end up being suspended when they
</EM><BR>
die.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; So, people shouldn't use this as an excuse for dismissing cryonics - if
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nobody is dismissing anything. You once again missed what this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all about.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, if you look back on this thread, you'll find that my original
<BR>
remarks were directed against a post that argued this very point -
<BR>

<BR>
all were high enough to constitute a valid reason for not bothering to sign

up.
