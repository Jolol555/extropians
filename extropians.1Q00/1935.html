<P>
There are two things that are certain, &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;Taxes&quot;.  A cliche precisely because it is said so often and believed by so many people.  Now you and I might not buy that meme, but much of the population on this planet does.  
<BR>
<P>As for people responding as if you had &quot;just torn your face off...&quot;, seems like a pretty natural, if distinctly &quot;2nd Millenium&quot;, response.  Reflecting on most of the people that I see on a day to day basis, two things become readily apparent; Most people appreciate a fair amount of &quot;Certainty&quot; in their lives, and a great many people live lives that are long strings of boredom punctuated by short spurts of interesting events.  For the person on the street, living for a very extended length of time would only be attractive if it meant escape from the general mundaneness of everyday life.  As well, the idea that Death is a certainty (part of the great circle of life)is so strong a meme in our societies that to give it up would cause most people some cognitive dissonance(which a lot of people will expend a lot of energy avoiding).  Each of us will in our own way deal with the &quot;truth&quot; of mortality.  And there is comfort in certainty, even if that certainty is the macabre belief that we must one day die.
<BR>
<P>On a personal note.  On two occasions I found myself facing my own mortality in &quot;Stage Wall&quot; fashion; Once while on call to go to the Gulf War, I was in the Navy (an acronym for Never Again Volunteer Yourself), the Other in a near drowning accident while Scuba diving(actually it was a near stupidity accident). On both these occasions I realized how much joy even the mundane aspect of life brought me.  And after the dust settled? Now to quote someone but I don't know who &quot;I want to live forever or die trying!&quot;.  I do however think that I will one day cease to &quot;be&quot; in the flesh, and I secretly hope that it is via being shot by the jealous lifemate of some alien babe while orbiting a massive Black Hole.
