&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reading some of the responses to Max's original post on God,
<BR>
arrogance and belief, it strikes me that there seems to be a sort of fear
<BR>
of commitment to the term &quot;atheist.&quot;  In my experience, many who call
<BR>
themselves agnostic and cringe at the word &quot;atheist&quot; have a deep rooted
<BR>
fear of possible repercussions from taking a firm stand on such a
<BR>
self-description --almost as if the slightest percentage of a possibility
<BR>
of God Itself (usually in the traditional 'image of man' form) condemning
<BR>
one's soul to eternal damnation is enough to leave the loophole in their
<BR>
belief systems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quibbling over semantics is not the real issue; the real issue is why many
<BR>
rational thinkers cannot trust their rational beliefs enough to call
<BR>
themselves atheists.  With all due respect to the self-proclaimed
<BR>
agnostics, I find such a belief position weak and compromising, with the
<BR>
underlying fear of commitment to one's most rational desires and thoughts
<BR>
as its basis.  The bottom line is this: either there are gods (or God, if
<BR>
you prefer) or there are not.  I cannot prove one way or the other, but I
<BR>
have a tremendously strong, rational belief that no God or gods exist.  For
<BR>
those who take such an either\or, compromising view as Agnosticism, I would
<BR>
not put much weight on any other view which they claim to support either.
<BR>
This is the same reason why many like-minded individuals could have a far
<BR>
friendlier conversation with a fundamental Christian, Buddhist --whatever--
<BR>
than with a non-committing Agnostic.
