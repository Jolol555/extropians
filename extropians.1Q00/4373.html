<P><EM>&gt; Well, as with any prediction of the future, I can only extrapolate from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present conditions.  I have only been alive 37 years and, due in large part 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to my voracious curiosity, I have rarely if ever suffered from any prolonged 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period of boredom (so long as I have had access to materials with which to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt to satisfy my curiosity--namely an interesting book or access to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet).  Now, I know its a bit presumptuous to try to predict the next 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 37,000 years based upon only the past 37, but given my present significant 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitive and experiential limitations its the best I can do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have the same impression. I have discovered that the more I learn,
<BR>
the more exciting just standing at a bus stop becomes - what was once
<BR>
just empty time is suddenly an opportunity to play with ideas, build
<BR>
stories and study the surroundings. 
<BR>
<P>I have also noted that the more I learn, the more I want to learn and
<BR>
experience. This causes a problem: I still only have 24 hours in a day
<BR>
and there are much more stuff I could do that I can do. Hence I
<BR>
constantly have to make choices about it, but for every exciting think
<BR>
I postpone I know I can nearly always return to it and do it
<BR>
someday. If I live to 37,000 I will likely have the time for most of
<BR>
the stuff I currently have postponed, but will now have an even
<BR>
greater number of future excitement to long for.
<BR>
