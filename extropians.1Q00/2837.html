<P><EM>    &gt; If a black hole has an event horizon from within which nothing can

<EM>    &gt;escape, then how can the mass within the black hole exert a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;gravitational attraction on anything outside the event horizon?
</EM><BR>
<P>Gravity is nothing but Space -Time curvature. If you place a canon ball on
<BR>
a rubber sheet the sheet will be distorted but that doesn't prove something
<BR>
must come out of the ball to bend the rubber.

<P><EM>    &gt;The only problem I've seen pointed out with black holes is that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;violate a &quot;conservation of information&quot; principle.  The basic problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;is that once matter goes into the black hole, its impossible to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;back any information that was contained in that matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps not. According to General Relativity any accelerating mass generates
<BR>
gravitational waves, as an object is being pulled into a Black Hole at ever increasing
<BR>
speed most of the resulting gravitational waves will escape before the thing is inside
<BR>
the hole. The waves might in theory contain enough information to reconstruct the
<BR>
object. I'd hate like hell to try to do it in practice however.

<P><EM>        &gt;What if two black holes began ever so slowly to collide.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless the two holes were exactly lined up, and they never would be, they'd go into orbit
<BR>
around each other. You'd get a spinning dumbbell shaped hole, but an unsymmetrical
<BR>
very massive object rotating at nearly the speed of light would radiate huge quantities of
<BR>
gravitational waves. When a gravitational wave leaves an object there is a recoil in the
<BR>
opposite direction, this would push the two parts of the dumbbell together very very quickly
<BR>
until you get a spherical hole. Stephen Hawking proved that the area of the event horizon of
<BR>
the resulting hole is always greater than or equal to the area of the two holes that made it,
<BR>
never less.
<BR>
<P>Hawking says this discovery gave him an important insight because he noticed that in this
<BR>
regard the area of the event horizon is similar to entropy, it also never decreases and he
<BR>
didn't think it was a coincidence. He wondered if this meant a Black Hole has entropy,
<BR>
if so he wondered if it had a temperature too, if so he wondered if it gave off Black Body
<BR>
radiation just like everything else that has a temperature, if so he wondered if the smaller
<BR>
a black hole was the higher its temperature would be, if so he wondered if it would keep
<BR>
getting smaller and thus hotter until it exploded. He found the answer to all these questions
<BR>
was yes.
