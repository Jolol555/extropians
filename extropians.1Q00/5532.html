</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What I noticed was that, from the point of view of the gunmen, facing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the compound, the camera was always off to their right.  There were never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any flashes as you say with the camera behind the gunmen, nor are there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any with the camera to the left of the gunmen.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: You're right, my error, the flashes are seen 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;across a range of angles to the *right* of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated muzzle (to the left of the viewer when 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;looking that the frames I was when I wrote that). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal, if in fact the flashes always occurred when 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the FLIR was in only one spot, then you might have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an argument, however, they do not. This graphic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/flir&sun.jpg">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/flir&sun.jpg</A> shows 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the outer limits of angles from which the FLIR  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sees flashes at location 5, which is located at the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/Figures/Fig02.jpg">http://rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/Figures/Fig02.jpg</A>)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conjunction of the red lines I've superimposed over 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox's graphic. The flashes are seen by the FLIR 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when the FLIR is in locations where the rear of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the gym (the rear-most structure) is visible and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from locations where the front of the building 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is visible. On/off bursts of rapid-pulse flashes 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occur at location 5 even as the FLIR plane moves 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;across a range of angles. These facts are totally 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inconsistent with a fixed reflective object.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A reflective object at location 5 would reflect 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a beam of sunlight that would be seen from only 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one angle and would appear as one single flash 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only once as the camera passed across that angle. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely inconsistent with the FLIR 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence before us. For the reflective-surface
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theory to have any merit, it must explain how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a single reflective object at one location can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reflect in many directions, doing so only some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the time, and most important, it must explain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;how it emits rapid-pulse reflections at a rate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;around 8 times per second. Nobody has done this,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus the reflective theory is without merit.  
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;I didn't find Cox's analysis very convincing.  He sets up all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these assumptions but doesn't indicate the limits of his reasoning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example, he describes &quot;misses&quot; in azimuth, where the plane isn't in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the right position to have seen a reflection.  He describes &quot;large&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;small&quot; misses, but never says what these mean quantitatively.  We need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to know these values, plus the uncertainty which would be caused by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tilted ground, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then in analyzing misses in altitude, he assumes the plane is at 9000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feet!  Oops, as the recent news stories have made clear, the plane was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at 4500 feet.  This not only eliminates this objection, it casts doubt on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his azimuth calculations since the plane wasn't where he thought it was.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It also makes you wonder about the thoroughness of his investigation.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I forwarded your comments on the specific 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;features of Cox's analysis that you raised to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;his webmaster. I hope he'll give us a reply.
