*thinks*  I don't stop dreaming, during the day... it
<BR>
just sort of slows down.  In idle moments, or when I'm
<BR>
sitting around, I dream while I'm drawing or writing. 
<BR>
Sometimes I get carried away, but not very often. 
<BR>
Pretty glad I'm not the type who talks in their sleep,
<BR>
I get the feeling I'd be muttering to myself while
<BR>
drawing or whatever.  I can remember long strings of
<BR>
things for a short period of time, also... when I was
<BR>
a child, and I used to get really excited about
<BR>
something I was reading (I was a big SF nut from about
<BR>
four onwards) I would run into my parents room and
<BR>
recite a page or two, the book hanging at my side.  I
<BR>
don't do that anymore, but once in a while I can
<BR>
recall something fairly strongly that I shouldn't *be*
<BR>
able to recall, knowing my normal memory.  It doesn't
<BR>
have to do anything with traumatic experiences or
<BR>
anything like that.  I remember the barcode off of one
<BR>
of the posters in my health class two years ago... I
<BR>
remember a conversation I had in nineteen eighty nine
<BR>
while I was in a restaurant almost verbatim, though it
<BR>
wasn't really about anything.  I guess you could call
<BR>
it occaisonal spontaneous eideticism... *sighs* wish I
<BR>
had it all the time.  Or when it would actually be
<BR>
usefull.

<EM>&gt; Lucky buggers. Here's one of my recurrent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obsessions: I believe most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take it for granted that everyone else in the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uses roughly the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of mental imagery protocols. We all know enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to distinguish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extroverts from shy cerebrotonics, and the jocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the willowy sensitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; types, and the inarticulate from the freely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; babbling, but since the early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1960s, when I had an epiphany about all this, I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been informally polling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people about their visual imagery. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most can form some kind of red triangle in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagination, and rotate it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the left, then to the right, and go on to make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; picture of their dear old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maman, check the color of her eyes, and so on. Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are exceptionally good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at this stunt, making elaborate flowcharts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tracking through them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without moving a muscle (or maybe they twitch in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sympathy). Others can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `see' whole movies as they read a novel. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Me, I've got *zero* visual imagery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The module's not there, apparently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is presumably one reason I was regarded as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cretin in primary and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of secondary school. I couldn't spell very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well, because I couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inwardly *see* the words. Eventually I managed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognize stuff on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; page, but answering `spelling bee' questions was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utterly hopeless. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though I soon knew five times as many words as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone else, and more or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less how to use them, I could not spell them orally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I couldn't *see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them inwardly* (whatever the hell that is).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Same thing with simple arithmetic and algebra, let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone geometry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hopeless. Scribble scribble, tongue out the corner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my mouth, maybe by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brute force I could work out what the fuck they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; babbling about, but so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much teaching was automatically pitched in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visualization mode that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was repeatedly stranded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I never became a scientist, to my intense regret.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't hack it as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosopher, either, once the notation started to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dance on the blackboard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I need to turn everything into narrative, run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compression algorithms on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; word chunks, then fool around with those. This can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be amazingly powerful,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and many poststructuralists do just this, hence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sound like posing wankers -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I suspect many of them must share my cognitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defect. Not all, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now that movies and visual art and TV are such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; major part of the pomo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agenda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has a very strange effect on my writing. Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I write a fair bit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fiction, often set in places where the settings are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfamiliar, I need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide the cues and codes that switch on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; readers' visual imagery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machinery. Since that stuff doesn't work with me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the inside, I'm in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; roughly the position of a deaf person learning to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grunt out sounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; painfully associated with meanings, with hardly any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate feedback.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's weird, I tell you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I reckon a lot of those smart people who never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite `achieved their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential' might have the same imagery structures as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine, or maybe other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds that are equally alien.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to hear from anyone else here with odd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal-imagery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modalities. (I should add that I seem to use a kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of ancillary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinesthetic imagery, with bits of my body image
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *feeling* rotated, etc, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space; so I can score fairly well on those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rotate-the-gadget-and-say-which-one-is-next tests in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IQ trials, by turning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself into one and dancing. I almost immediately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knew the answer to one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; famous question about tetrahedra, cited in an A. C.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clarke novel, that only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; geniuses are supposed to get. But I'm damned if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can *picture* a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tetrahedron in my head...)
