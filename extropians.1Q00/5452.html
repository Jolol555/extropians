<P>
<EM>&gt; I have a friend, Octavio, who is a doctor; he is very sympathetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the cause of social development and social justice in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to have your permission to send him a PRIVATE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy of your brilliant letter.  I will tell him that he is NOT to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send it to anyone else without YOUR permission.  Only this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Forum and my friend the doctor will know of your letter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you may trust me on that promise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, go ahead the more people that has access to it the better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; May I also say that when Americans like myself say things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are critical of our country, which we love as much as you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yours, it is because we are trying to understand things better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and to find better ways of solving our own problems. For every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad thing I might say about the United States, I could easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say three very good things.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, the usa is a country I like a lot, and it has several good
<BR>
things as well, I just wanted to express my opinion about the things
<BR>
I dislike from the U.S. Here we have a lot of bad things too but
<BR>
I think we have more good things than bad and I also have to accept
<BR>
that our cooperation with the U.S. And the rest of the world has
<BR>
improved greatly over the years, it looks like we are slowly learning
<BR>
to be good neighboors and it is also obvious we need each other to
<BR>
survive.
<BR>
<P>I hope that with more people with access to this information the 
<BR>
changes
<BR>
will happen sooner.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Just one more thing: when we speak honestly about the greed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of some American corporations, we are talking about a business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization and its practices.  Often, most if not all of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Americans who work for this corporation are as greedy, but no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more greedy, than you or I.  But complex organizations have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a life of their own, and often situations arise where no one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really in control of operations, so that the evil, if there is any,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refers to a human invention, and not necessarily to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can earn their living because we created what at times behaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a monster.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree... all corporations and it's employees are greedy because it's
<BR>
natural they want to make money, I consider myself a greedy person as 
<BR>
well
<BR>
however I try to be ethic, so I don't hurt others in my pursuit of 
<BR>
money
<BR>
or success.
<BR>
<P>I think that's what makes us extropians, we want to use technology, 
<BR>
science
<BR>
and the resources we have to make our world and lifes better.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Thank you for your letter,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bob
</EM><BR>
<P>You are welcome.
<BR>
