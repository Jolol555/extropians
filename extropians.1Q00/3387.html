<P><P>I disagree to a certain extent with respect to &quot;peaceful&quot;.  The aggressive,
<BR>
competitive tendencies that often lead to behaviors that would be
<BR>
difficult to classify as &quot;peaceful&quot; are essential in many aspects of
<BR>
business.  I have a strong suspicion that in a competition between &quot;smart,
<BR>
peaceful&quot; and &quot;smart, aggressive&quot;, the aggressive side would probably win.
<BR>
I realize that &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;belligerent&quot; are not the same,
<BR>
but they *are* on the same side of the tracks.  Competition between
<BR>
businesses can be viewed as a form of economic warfare from the POV of the
<BR>
businesses involved.  
<BR>
<P>The current gene pool would seem to indicate that &quot;smart, aggressive&quot; is a
<BR>
more successful mix.  But as with all things, it depends on what your
<BR>
goals are.
