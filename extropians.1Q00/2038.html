<EM>&gt; &gt; You are absolutely right.  What was I thinking?  The police force and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prosecutors would not arrest and prosecute one of their own!  That is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exactly why the system failed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An alternative solution: create a second police system with no power to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investigate or arrest private citizens, and charge it with investigate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal activities of public officials and the regular police force.
</EM><BR>
That
<BR>
<EM>&gt; gives you a special interest that actually benefits from prosecuting these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of offenses, instead of trying to cover them up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, then you have to worry about abuses by this new police force,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; cops and public officials are in a much better position to defend
</EM><BR>
themselves
<BR>
<EM>&gt; against corrupt prosecutors than an ordinary citizen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Though your proposal has merit, the police forces in the US already have
<BR>
internal affairs divisions which are supposed to do just that.  It also
<BR>
sounds a lot like what happens in dictatorships where new groups are created
<BR>
to watch over old one loyal to the dictator.  (Think of the SS as Hitler's
<BR>
means of keeping control over the Stormtroopers (SA).)  One wonders where
<BR>
this stops.
<BR>
<P>Still, the idea is not totally ludicrist.  One problem I do see is that of
<BR>
regulatory capture.  A lot of regulatory agencies -- and Billy's &quot;second
<BR>
police system&quot; is this with guns (some nonpolice government agencies also
<BR>
carry guns, such as park rangers) -- become captured by what they regulate.
<BR>
While the second police force would have a vested interest in
<BR>
arresting/prosecuting cops, the first police force would have an interest in
<BR>
making sure it controlled or came into a symbiotic relationship with the
<BR>
second one.  This is why big drug companies have so much sway over the FDA,
<BR>
why defense contractors control the Pentagon, why teachers have the biggest
<BR>
say in school board elections (which are notably held separate from regular
<BR>
elections), and why beauty school owners often sit on the beautician's
<BR>
boards in their areas.
<BR>
<P>The regulated have a greater interest than the general public in currying
<BR>
favor from the regulators.  See, e.g., _The Rule of Experts_ by S. David
<BR>
Young details this process in various licensed industries in the US.  (The
<BR>
same applies elsewhere.  Look at the Olympic bribery scandal, which is
<BR>
merely a recent, high profile instance.)
<BR>
<P>One could have a citizen review board instead, though such things usually
<BR>
become very political -- as has happened in NYC, USA.  The citizen review
<BR>
board there has basically become a way for the Mayor and his critics to do
<BR>
battle -- as opposed to it professed mission.
<BR>
<P>I think, however, the best solutions to this &quot;who watches the watchers&quot;
<BR>
problem are 1) to reduce the overall power of government so that the chances
<BR>
for corrupt or wrong behavior are lower (if cops are not allowed, e.g., to
<BR>
search motor vehicles or people's person with a warrant, then less people
<BR>
will be harassed by cops fishing for evidence) and 2) to spread the ideals
<BR>
of a free and rational culture so that the people don't tolerate
<BR>
governmental abuses of power (a daunting task, but this is the sort of
<BR>
culture -- in a diluted form -- that gave us the Bill of Rights and its
<BR>
protections).
