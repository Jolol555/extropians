<P>I am continuing to think about ways to do this.  Lately, I have been considering
<BR>
dumping some mountain tops through underground tunnels that come up under the
<BR>
ocean.  It has some advantage because you can run the thing off the difference in
<BR>
gravitational energy, and do not have as big a cooling problem as my last
<BR>
suggestion.  Of course, you have to pick a mountain that people will allow to be
<BR>
moved, but this may be offset by the nice flat land you can give them where the
<BR>
mountain was.  For a small island, you may only need a small part of a mountain (or
<BR>
just hollow out a part) given that you can restructure the material to have just as
<BR>
much strength at a much lower density.
<BR>
<P>I remember thinking about this stuff back in the early seventies, long before the
<BR>
promise of MNT.  I was considering what it would take to build a robot harbor
<BR>
dredger.  This machine would swim into a harbor and dredge up a load of silt from
<BR>
the bottom and then swim out and dump it in deep water.  My design allowed the
<BR>
machine to recharge its batteries from the gravitational energy of lowering the
<BR>
silt.  This way it could work 24-7 and would have to surface only to replace worn
<BR>
parts.  After working on this a while, I realized that a fleet of these could be
<BR>
used to build a deep water island out of parts of the undersea shelf.  The surface
<BR>
part of the island would go slowly, because the robots would need to dump most of
<BR>
the load in deep water to get the energy to put a small part of the load on the
<BR>
surface, but it could be done.  All of the above is not very practical (i.e. would
<BR>
cost too much) unless you can &quot;grow&quot; the robots.  (Anyone know how much we could get
<BR>
paid to dredge a deep channel up the Mississippi?  The Gulf is a nice place to put
<BR>
an island.)
<BR>
<P>One of the problems with MNT is that it makes too much possible.  When it gets here,
<BR>
I fear I will find myself in the position of the proverbial centipede who could not
<BR>
decide which foot to move first.
