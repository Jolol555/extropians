Gina Miller, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:nanogirl@halcyon.com?Subject=Re:%20why%20atomic%20precision%20assemblers?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200001230140.RAA04213@finney.org&gt;">nanogirl@halcyon.com</A>&gt;, writes regarding nano-assembly:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's the molecular building blocks approach. Many people are considering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this as a first step towards mature molecular manufacturing and for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes molecular building blocks may be all that we need. But if you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to build very strong diamondoid materials you need to be able to put every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atom in it's place. It's a first step, it may be sufficient for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes, but it won't give you diamondoid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Drexler's work does seem to be based on using small molecular units for
<BR>
assembly.  Nanosystems in section 8.6.4 describes several methods for
<BR>
diamond construction, depending on what crystal face you are working on.
<BR>
The first, for adding to what is called the 111 surface, consists of
<BR>
(1) removing a hydrogen, (2) adding a unit consisting of two carbons
<BR>
and a hydrogen, (3) adding a hydrogen to the carbons just added, and (4)
<BR>
removing two hydrogens farther along.  This keeps the face of the carbon
<BR>
terminated with hydrogen atoms to preserve the necessary crystalline
<BR>
structure.  They also a one at a time carbon atom addition to the 110
<BR>
crystal surface, and a pairwise carbon atom addition to the 100 face.
<BR>
<P>In 8.6.5 he discusses building with even larger units, Cumulene strands,
<BR>
which are one-dimensional strings of pure carbon, or hexagonal strands
<BR>
like tightly rolled tubes of graphite, can be laid down parallel to
<BR>
produce diamond structures.
<BR>
<P>I think the bottom line is that the particular tools and units that are
<BR>
used will depend on the mechanical and chemical constraints of what is
<BR>
to be built.  It may turn out that you add some atoms in a unit, and
<BR>
then remove some of what you just added.  In the 111 diamond synthesis,
<BR>
it is necessary to keep putting on and taking off hydrogen atoms to
<BR>
prevent incorrect bonds from forming as the carbon loops back on itself.
<BR>
The best synthesis approach for a given structure will depend on messy
<BR>
details of chemistry.
