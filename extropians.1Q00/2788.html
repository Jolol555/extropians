Keep some of that cutting and pasting in there, John; I find it helpful,
<BR>
because wading through the thread is a pain. Maybe reply at the top and have
<BR>
the thread below; that way, one peruses if necessary. You could reply inline
<BR>
to the most pertinent stuff, then have an &quot;Appendices&quot; section, I guess.
<BR>
Make those messages bigger; it encourages people to chuck that old 14.4K
<BR>
modem they've been to damn lazy to replace.

<EM>&gt; I am trying to change.  My first impulse was to cut and paste Queenemuse's

<EM>&gt; entire Seussian riff but I caught myself and just copied the part most

<EM>&gt; appealling to me.  Again, it shocked me when I first got on the list and
</EM><BR>
saw
<BR>
<EM>&gt; all the cut and pasting.  In time I picked up the habit.  I'm glad we
</EM><BR>
don't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; all meet at a nearby restaurant everyday where there is drinking and
</EM><BR>
smoking
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for hours!  You folks are a terrible influence on me. :)

<P>I was thinking that &quot;stuff vitamin pills down your neck&quot; might be closer to
<BR>
the mark, but I am suspicious about how many of us actually try practical
<BR>
life extension, and how many of us just wait for the miracle cure (and this
<BR>
from someone who is trying to get a notebook together, so he can do his
<BR>
teleworking in the nearest cafe, replete with endless latte's...)
