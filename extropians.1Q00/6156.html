<EM>&gt; I agree it is in principle possible, within known physics, to copy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pattern of function and interconnection of the brain, and to implement a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functional equivalent in some type of computer.  Such a process could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; termed &quot;copying the contents of a brain.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know if you're aware of this, but the atoms within the brain do
<BR>
not remain constant.  I forget what the exact rate of turnover is, but
<BR>
something like 50% of the atoms get replaced every six months.  So
<BR>
whatever &quot;we&quot; are, it's clearly not the atoms.
<BR>
<P>If you scan in one neuron at a time, destroy the old neuron, and replace
<BR>
it with a robotic interface to equivalent computations taking place
<BR>
elsewhere, you can migrate, one neuron at a time, to the new substrate,
<BR>
without ever losing consciousness.  In this case, would it not be
<BR>
possible to say that the new individual is unambiguously &quot;you&quot;, with the
<BR>
change of physical substrate as irrelevant as the turnover among your
<BR>
constituent amino acids?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How is your notion of &quot;migrating consciousness&quot; different from the ancient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea that there exists a &quot;spirit&quot; which can possibly move from one body to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another?  If this is not what you believe, shouldn't you make this clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by not adopting language that will be taken as implying that this is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you propose to achieve, by means of technology?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody cares about what the ancient ideas are.  The comparision is
<BR>
wholly irrelevant, like making fun of airplanes by comparing them to the
<BR>
legends of Daedalus or the chariot of the Sun.  We discuss only the
<BR>
technical possibility.
<BR>
<P>And yes, if you can move an identity into a computer, then you can
<BR>
create duplicates of the identity as well as moving it.  You're the one
<BR>
bound by the ancient preconceptions, not Samantha.  Your preconception
<BR>
of the mysterious spirit requires that it not be subject to copying;
<BR>
then, you use the fact that a given technical procedure could copy a
<BR>
spirit to prove by an alleged reductio ad absurdum that the same
<BR>
technical procedure cannot move it, or that the process of moving only
<BR>
creates a copy.
<BR>
<P>If you take a brain and put in the blender, you destroy the
<BR>
informational identity.  If you replace one neuron at a time with a
<BR>
biologically equivalent neuron, or just wait a few years while the cells
<BR>
metabolisms churn, you have moved the identity from one set of atoms to
<BR>
another.  If you replace one neuron at a time with a computational
<BR>
equivalent, you have moved the identity from one set of atoms to
<BR>
another.  If you read out the information and create a functionally
<BR>
equivalent copy, you have created two identities, neither of which has
<BR>
any stronger claim to being the &quot;real you&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In short, your argument rests on a sleight-of-hand.  If you
<BR>
nondestructively copy all the information in the brain, creating a
<BR>
duplicate, then the impulse is strong to identify the original set of
<BR>
atoms as the &quot;real you&quot;, implying that the second set of atoms is a
<BR>
&quot;fake you&quot; - and if a nondestructive upload &quot;merely creates a copy&quot;,
<BR>
then surely a destructive upload also &quot;merely creates a copy&quot;.  If one
<BR>
set of atoms maintain physical identity, and the other doesn't, then the
<BR>
temptation is very strong to say that the first set of atoms has a
<BR>
stronger claim to informational identity.  But this is a mere
<BR>
anthropomorphism.  If the informational equality is perfect - i.e., with
<BR>
margins of error substantially below the ordinary &quot;noise level&quot; of the
<BR>
brain's computational environment - then both sets of atoms have an
<BR>
equally strong claim to being the &quot;real you&quot;.  They are both the
<BR>
original.  They are both copies.  The atoms are irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>Who says there's such a thing as an observer-independent definition of
<BR>
personal identity, anyway?  Maybe someday we'll discover one, but we
<BR>
certainly have no experimental base with which to make the assertion in
<BR>
present time - just a set of preconceptions derived from the &quot;ancient idea&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But I am not an object.  I am not a noun, I am an adjective.  I am the
<BR>
way matter behaves when it is organized in a John K Clark-ish way.  At
<BR>
the present time only one chunk of matter in the universe behaves that
<BR>
way; someday that could change.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- John K Clark
<BR>
<P>Yours,
<BR>
Eliezer.
