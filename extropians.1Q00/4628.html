<P>
The Department of Defense under the auspices of the recently passed 
<BR>
antiterrorism bill have added new DOMESTIC antiterrorism teams.  The 
<BR>
new units shoulder patch was recently delivered to a friend of mine. 
<BR>
You may view the new shoulder patch at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.mccullagh.org/image/otherphotos/terror.html">http://www.mccullagh.org/image/otherphotos/terror.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Thanks to Declan Mccullagh for placing the digital photo of the patch 
<BR>
on his web site.  The patch came to a Freematt's Alerts subscriber, 
<BR>
who is a retired police supervisor.  The patch came in an unmarked, 
<BR>
brown envelope.  According to an unnamed military source the patch is 
<BR>
of the latest issue (about 8 weeks old).  On a related front,  Ohio 
<BR>
currently is in the process of getting 5 - 50 man anti-terrorist 
<BR>
teams to be attached to the Ohio National Guard and stationed in the 
<BR>
following areas:  Cleveland, Toledo, Cincinnati, Central Ohio 
<BR>
(Columbus) and the Akron/Canton/Youngstown area.  These units are 
<BR>
funded via a separate channel and are not funded by the state 
<BR>
government, but rather from a federal antiterrorism fund.  It is not 
<BR>
clear who they take their orders from.  Other National Guardsmen are 
<BR>
not being informed of these unit activations, the reason given is the 
<BR>
usual &quot;need to Know&quot; excuse.
<BR>
<P>These units have training from and are rotating out of Rangers, Delta 
<BR>
(Combat Applications Group), SOCOM, and other 'snake-eater' groups. 
<BR>
This has been in the works for the last couple of years.  Originally 
<BR>
each state was supposed to get one 50 man unit.  Ohio requested, and 
<BR>
apparently obtained, a total of 5 (250 men total). Other states have 
<BR>
at least one 50 man unit with some states getting additional teams as 
<BR>
needed or requested.  These state groups are not to be confused with 
<BR>
the unit that is featured with the above shoulder patch.  That 
<BR>
apparently is a national or federal antiterrorism team.
<BR>
<P>It should be obvious that everyone should be concerned over the 
<BR>
constitutional questions as to the legality of such military teams 
<BR>
acting domestically.  Of equal concern to me is that due to the cult 
<BR>
of secrecy of our military forces, it is very unclear just what role 
<BR>
and power these new units have or will have.  I'm especially 
<BR>
concerned that in an age of decreased domestic terrorism (The US is 
<BR>
currently at a 20 year low) the rapid and ill defined expansion of 
<BR>
police state groups such as this will cause more domestic incidents 
<BR>
such as the bungled raid at Waco.  When the only tool you have is a 
<BR>
hammer every problem looks like a nail.

Subject: Re: JPEG of DOD Anti-Terrorist patch -- WHO'S IN CHARGE?!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Subject: JPEG of DOD Anti-Terrorist patch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;This [shoulder patch] came from a police supervisor on my list.  Interesting.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Although the shoulder-patch came from a police supervisor, what is MOST
<BR>
interesting about it is that its logo indicates that it is a Dept of
<BR>
DEFENSE patch ... *not* a patch of *civilian* law enforcement -- Dept of
<BR>
Justice, FBI, ATF, etc.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the *real* questions are crucial *Constitutional* questions:
<BR>
<P>1.  Does this patch imply that *domestic* counter-terrorism efforts in the
<BR>
*civilian* sector are now under the direction and control of a *military*
<BR>
task force in the Dept of Defense, rather than under control of *civilian*
<BR>
domestic law enforcement agencies?
<BR>
<P>2.  Are there parallel Anti-Terrorism Task Forces in the *civilian* Dept of
<BR>
Justice (FBI) and perhaps Treasury Dept (ATF)?  If so, are they operating
<BR>
separately from the Defense Dept task force -- with likely wasteful
<BR>
redundancy, turf-wars and information-hoarding?  Of if they are [hopefully]
<BR>
cooperating, then who the hell is really in charge?!  Is the military
<BR>
controlling or making decisions for *civilian* law enforcement?
<BR>
<P>3.  Are the apparently-operational (complete with shoulder-patches)
<BR>
*military* anti-terrorism officers and staff active in *civilian* domestic
<BR>
investigative and/or enforcement activities?  If so, are they on their own,
<BR>
or are they under control if *civilian* law enforcement?  And -- if not, is
<BR>
this the first step in a military take-over over civilian law enforcement,
<BR>
and/or investigation of American civilians (or is it just one more step in
<BR>
the often-apparent, covert creeping militarism of formerly-civilian law
<BR>
enforcement?!)?
<BR>
<P>Would any of our elected so-called representatives -- presidential or
<BR>
congressional -- *dare* to ask these questions?  Publicly?!  And *demand*
<BR>
answers?!!
