<EM>&gt; &gt; Look at this one guy who employs a handful of people and has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his own supercomputer. He's beating the pants off of the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people in decoding the genome, and because the government hates being on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the losing end, is now trying to socialize his results.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Point A:  He is not beating the pants of &quot;the government&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Firstly, it is not the government, but a mixture of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     government, philanthropic, and pharmaceutical money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Secondly, &quot;The government&quot; have gotten about as far as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Venter, arguably further, as PE Corp has a bunch of fragments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     which they _may_ assemble first, no one knows.
</EM><BR>
<P>a) the government project has been at it for ten years. Venter started
<BR>
two or three years ago and has already sequenced the fly genome, which
<BR>
shares about an 80%+ commonality with the human genome, and will finish
<BR>
the human genome one or two years before the government project, and at
<BR>
a cost that is a small fraction of what the government has spent. I'd
<BR>
say thats beating the pants off of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Point B: In my humble opinion Venter is being granted ownership  to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information which is not for sale. I own it already. And so do you. I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selling. Therefore I do not want the government (who is trying via their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patent officers) to steal my ownership rights and give them to Craig Venter.
</EM><BR>
<P>The human genome is something that I do agree all human beings share an
<BR>
equal ownership in. The government apparently has no intention to give
<BR>
Venter any patent rights at all, and is pretty pissed that he's making
<BR>
them look like idiots. Considering that any government information that
<BR>
isn't classified for defense purposes is required to be made available
<BR>
to everyone freely, the government is breaking its own law by refusing
<BR>
to provide Venter (who is one of us) with any of their own results. Not
<BR>
only that, but they are trying to get Venter to share his results
<BR>
without any sort of propreitary use agreement. When he balked at this,
<BR>
they got all huffy and started making him look like the bad guy.
<BR>
<P>So far as I know, all Venter is interested in doing with the genome
<BR>
information is to package it and sell it to other researchers. The fact
<BR>
that he added value to the information by actually sequencing it is the
<BR>
value and investment he has a right to a return on. He has no problem
<BR>
with other companies doing their own sequencing and selling that
<BR>
information. What he has a problem with is other companies getting for
<BR>
free his results that the government wants him to provide to them. As
<BR>
far as I am concerned, he is totally justified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He is not patenting innovative medicine, or proteomic interventions, or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _functional_ variants on the genome.
</EM><BR>
<P>he isnt trying to patent anything that I have heard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead, he has filed patents on thousands of _fragments_ of code. Raw code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since when?
