<P><EM>&gt; I believe that it was pointed out in Science a year or two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago, that efforts to catalogue and preserve endangered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species was wrong-headed.  Why?  Because the investment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time and money for each &quot;endangered&quot; species was so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large and the extinction rate so rapid, that while you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were saving one species you were aware of you would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; losing hundreds you were unaware of.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with this is that there is no such high extinction rate at 
<BR>
present. To cite &quot;Species Loss Revisited&quot; by Julian Simon and Aaron 
<BR>
Wildavsky (reprinted in the book &quot;The State of Humanity&quot; by Julian Simon): 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The scare about species extinction has been manufactured in complete 
<BR>
contradiction of the scientific data.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest proven observed rate of extinction until now is only one 
<BR>
species per year. Yet the &quot;official&quot; forecast has been 40,000 species 
<BR>
dying out per year in this century, a million in all.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P>Additional criticism of the &quot;bio-geography&quot; theory of extinction rates 
<BR>
recently been reported in _Science_ (Charles C. Mann, &quot;Extinction: Are 
<BR>
Ecologists Crying Wolf?&quot;, _Science_, 253 (Aug. 1991), 736-8), but further 
<BR>
discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Now, don't get me wrong. I am of the opinion that every extinction that 
<BR>
occurs is a tragedy, and a worse one if we haven't gotten ANY samples of 
<BR>
DNA since we have no idea what marvelous inventions mother nature has 
<BR>
encoded there. I just think that we need to have a well balanced view of 
<BR>
what the actual ecological problems of the world are, as opposed to what 
<BR>
the scare mongers would have us believe.
