<EM>&gt; And of course this goes the other way when the first gengineered apples

<P>Well, just to be balanced about this -- In '89 I went to Australia
<BR>
to watch the America's Cup races, had my first encounter with Kiwis.
<BR>
Ate quite a few of them while I was there.  Came back to the states
<BR>
and didn't eat any for a while.  After a couple of years I tried one.
<BR>
My face swells up, my eyes fog over with mucus, my sinuses clog.
<BR>
Classic hyperimmune reaction.  I suspect a couple of Kiwis could
<BR>
come close to killing me.  My father now has the same problem with
<BR>
bee stings.   I've got a pretty good immune system and don't get
<BR>
sick very much, the downside is potential overreactions to rarely
<BR>
encountered proteins or other chemical molecules.
<BR>
<P>While there is a slight chance that the reaction may be due to
<BR>
some preservative or pesticide they put on Kiwi's in the U.S.,
<BR>
I'd be more willing to bet it is the natural Kiwi chemical content.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line -- It doesn't tke Genetic Engineering to make foods
<BR>
dangerous.  There are millions of people with nut and other
<BR>
allergies that are quite aware of this.  What Genetic Engineering
<BR>
will eventually offer is foods with the hyperallergic promoting
<BR>
molecules removed.  We have a way to go until we get there however.
<BR>
<P>So, to my mind all foods are potentially dangerous and *informed*
<BR>
consumers, esp. those who tend to be hyperallergic, should have access
<BR>
to all that information.  But to the large fraction of the population
<BR>
that doesn't experience these problems, a little information can be
<BR>
a dangerous thing.
