<P>
I was watching C-span this morning, killing time till I left for a
<BR>
routine physical. The featured story was about independant truck
<BR>
drivers and their attempts to get some government action going over
<BR>
the recent dramatic oil price hikes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Thinking of our own EvMick I was pondering what kind of things we
<BR>
could come up with that could help, besides some sort of
<BR>
legislation.
<BR>
<P>One of my forte's are electronic commerce networks. I envision
<BR>
something like this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;EvMick is cruising down the road in his new hypertruck, one of the
<BR>
things going is his new GPS based ECN. (electronic commerce
<BR>
network) As he drives along he not only gets route info, but every
<BR>
fuel stop is displayed along with it's real time prices. The
<BR>
display is colorcoded (red,yellow,green) so EvMick can see at a
<BR>
glance which stations are in range. Noting that he's going to need
<BR>
a fillup, Mick spots a likely vendor on his screen, with a few
<BR>
quick keystrokes he submits a bid for a hundred or so gallons at a
<BR>
price a few cents below his posted price.
<BR>
<P>Before the hapless station owner can even reply, another station
<BR>
owner nearby spots EvMicks bid and based on Micks location, knows
<BR>
he's within range, and offers to fill Micks bid. A bit of hageling
<BR>
later, Mick accepts the bid from the second owner for a bit less
<BR>
than he originally bid.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A number of questioners on the show were after the Govt to crack
<BR>
the strategic oil reserve over this. I thought rather than do this,
<BR>
and rather than open their own oil reserve, they might insure their
<BR>
most precious commodity by futures contracts.
<BR>
<P>Ideas, comments?
