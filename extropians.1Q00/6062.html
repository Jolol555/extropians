<P>Which brings me back to what Natasha and Robert are saying.  People are
<BR>
acting against their self-interest.  They need to be educated,
<BR>
culturally.  Plain, old-fashioned marketing.  If there is any role for an
<BR>
NGO, it is education.  Once people are sold on the idea that a greatly
<BR>
expanded lifespan is highly valuable for both themselves and most of 
<BR>
the people around them, the market demand and investment dollars will flow
<BR>
naturally.  There is a mantra embedded in the collective consciousness,
<BR>
&quot;The Internet is the Future.&quot;  Seeing how that simple hypnotic phrase has
<BR>
transformed our economy overnight, I can only imagine what the effects
<BR>
would be after embedding a similar suggestion about longevity.

<P>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri game featured an advert for the Longevity Vaccine
<BR>
which I've always thought was a superb piece of extropian propaganda.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I want to live for ever - who wouldnt.  Failing that I'd settle for a
<BR>
couple of thousand years.  Even five hundred would be nice&quot;
