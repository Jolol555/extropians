<BR>
<P>First artificial DNA can create new forms of life
<BR>
<P>Jonathan Leake and Roger Dobson
<BR>
<P>SCIENTISTS have made the world's first synthetic DNA - the molecules that
<BR>
form the blueprint for life.
<BR>
<P>The breakthrough means that the first artificial organisms could be &quot;born&quot;
<BR>
within two years and raises the prospect of humans redesigning whole
<BR>
species, including themselves.
<BR>
<P>The DNA was created at the University of Texas where researchers have mapped
<BR>
out the exact way it will be configured to create synthetic organism one
<BR>
(SO1), the microbe destined to be the world's first man-made creature.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We are synthesising DNA to create the first synthetic organism,&quot; said
<BR>
Professor Glen Evans, director of the university's genome science and
<BR>
technology centre. &quot;SO1 will have no specific function but once it is alive
<BR>
we can customise it. We can go back to the computer and change a gene and
<BR>
create other new life forms by simply pressing a button.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The researchers are planning to create a series of designer bugs, with
<BR>
super-efficient mechanisms for infecting target tissues such as cancer
<BR>
tumours - and then killing them. Some would infect the human gut to produce
<BR>
vitamin C.
<BR>
<P>Critics, however, have warned that the scientists risk unleashing a microbe
<BR>
master race with increased powers to infect humans and wildlife.
<BR>
<P>The researchers' success lies in having found a way to create long chains of
<BR>
DNA. Such chains are made up of four types of molecule which join up in
<BR>
twosomes known as &quot;base pairs&quot;. The base pairs then link to form a ladder
<BR>
that twists into the famous DNA double helix.
<BR>
<P>In nature, one chain of DNA can contain hundreds of thousands of base pairs.
<BR>
Until now, however, scientists have found it impossible to join together
<BR>
more than 100.
<BR>
<P>Evans's team has broken this barrier with a technique that first creates
<BR>
short chains of DNA and then joins them together in a controllable way.
<BR>
<P>The scientists are close to achieving chains that contain 100,000 base
<BR>
pairs - enough to form the basis for simple life forms.
<BR>
<P>The design for SO1 is based on analyses of the genes of other small
<BR>
bacteria. Genes are the functional units of DNA, each one being responsible
<BR>
for creating a protein essential to processes such as respiration.
<BR>
<P>Evans plans to copy the vital genes from each bacterium, select the best and
<BR>
join them together. In nature all DNA also contains &quot;junk genes&quot; with no
<BR>
function but Evans plans to omit these - possibly making SO1 the most
<BR>
efficient organism that has lived.
<BR>
<P>The work to create SO1 is complex but the test of success will be simple.
<BR>
Can SO1 feed and reproduce? If so, then Evans will indeed be celebrating new
<BR>
life. Opponents, however, will regard such an event very differently.
<BR>
<P>Tony Juniper, policy and campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said
<BR>
the bugs could present a serious threat to human health and the environment.
<BR>
He said: &quot;Scientists have already unleashed genetically modified organisms
<BR>
and we are now seeing the damage they can do. Playing God by creating
<BR>
entirely new life forms could have very serious consequences which should be
<BR>
publicly and fully debated.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Others are less perturbed. Michael Reiss, a specialist in bioethics at
<BR>
Cambridge University, said he would become concerned only if such life
<BR>
became sentient. &quot;In the 19th century people thought there was some vital
<BR>
essence to life and there was real controversy when the first organic
<BR>
compounds were made. My own view is that DNA is just an extension of that
<BR>
process,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Evans believes that man will one day be able to create complex life forms.
<BR>
For now, however, the first benefit could be simpler - the end of the
<BR>
vitamin pill. &quot;Humans need but cannot make vitamin C because we lack one
<BR>
particular enzyme,&quot; he said. &quot;If we put that enzyme into one of our
<BR>
artificial organisms and drink it, the bug will live in our guts making
<BR>
vitamin C for ever.&quot;
