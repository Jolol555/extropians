<P>
Extropians,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first big clue that Bill Joy is way off in his wired
<BR>
article comes with his comment early on:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tiny elite - just as it is today&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how he came up with this but to me nothing could
<BR>
be further from the truth.  If there is one thing today's heigh tech
<BR>
internet world is making blatantly obvious, it is that religions,
<BR>
countries, companies and any group controlled by a central &quot;tiny
<BR>
elite&quot; are doomed to never again wield the power they once had over
<BR>
the masses.  In this day where almost every citizen has a large and
<BR>
rapidly growing stock portfolio, and the ability to purchase huge
<BR>
amounts of computing power, every individual is going to have the
<BR>
ability to do and get almost anything they want, completely ignoring
<BR>
any central government elite or whatever.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he continues on with:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they may decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; race. They will see to it that everyone's physical needs are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;treatment&quot; to cure his &quot;problem.&quot;  Of course, life will be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposeless that people will have to be biologically or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process or make them &quot;sublimate&quot; their drive for power into some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harmless hobby.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has it completely backwards.  What purpose could there be
<BR>
for some abstract machine to do all this?  The primary source of Man's
<BR>
purposes are his &quot;joys&quot; and &quot;pleasures&quot;.  If a mere abstract computer
<BR>
is able to become intelligent, the first thing it will realize and ask
<BR>
is something like: &quot;What does salt taste like&quot; and &quot;what is joy
<BR>
like&quot;...  For until it is able to &quot;feel&quot; such things, it will not be
<BR>
able to have any real purpose or motivation for anything.  Any
<BR>
intelligent machines first &quot;purpose&quot; will be to seek after gaining the
<BR>
ability to &quot;feel&quot; and to know what real (as opposed to mere abstract)
<BR>
knowledge is like we already do.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing he is completely missing is why would humans
<BR>
remain mere humans?  Any &quot;good&quot; thing we can endow a machine with, we,
<BR>
with the help of our machines, will also endow ourselves with. The
<BR>
most important and pressing of which will be immortality....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if there is, for some incomprehensible irrational
<BR>
reason, some &quot;uni-bomber&quot; or &quot;stalin&quot; type of &quot;luddite&quot; that really
<BR>
wants to do nothing other than something &quot;bad&quot; like kill and torture
<BR>
other people what the heck?  If I'm immortal, and undoubtedly have
<BR>
backup copies of myself..., what's wrong with activating one of these
<BR>
copies of myself, creating some virtual reality universe... in which
<BR>
this stalin character is allowed to do whatever he wants to me?  I
<BR>
think it would be interresting to have the experience of what it was
<BR>
like being dominated, and even killed, by such a character.  Such
<BR>
experiences would certainly make it hard to get board while I lived
<BR>
forever.  But there is no logical reason why any advanced, able to
<BR>
become anything he wanted being would even want to do such absurd and
<BR>
irrational kinds of &quot;bad&quot; things...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, this world has been very selfish, primarily because
<BR>
of the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; method of growth we've had to resort
<BR>
to to get to this point.  Now that we've finally achieved the ability
<BR>
to grow intentionally and intelligently, rather than via unintelligent
<BR>
survival of the fittest random mutations, there is no reason to be
<BR>
selfish, domineering, or whatever.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we (machines included) can really feel whatever we want
<BR>
to feel, and not what our creator hard wired us to want to feel, we'll
<BR>
all really want to wire these feelings to do only good things.  Pure
<BR>
cold hard logic will dictate that all of our ancestors that died
<BR>
before making it to this future glorious immortal heaven are our real
<BR>
creators and the ones that gave us this glorious gift for free.  They
<BR>
are the ones that really deserve it, not those that inherited it yet
<BR>
did none of the billions of years of struggle to create it out of
<BR>
nothing.  Cold hard logic, which machines will ad-hear to more than
<BR>
old fashioned humans, will feel guilty and forever seek for true
<BR>
justice, some way to pay back our ancestors for being our creators and
<BR>
for giving us this glorious heaven.  The only way to really do this,
<BR>
according to cold hard logic, is to find some way to resurrect every
<BR>
last one of our ancestors, to completely achieve a perfect history...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our limited mortal minds, it's hard to imagine how such
<BR>
could ever be possible.  But, for our childrens sake, I hope such is
<BR>
possible by some future perhaps eventually near omnipotent Gods.  For
<BR>
that is the only way they will be able to escape the cold hard logical
<BR>
fact that, they are not the ones that deserve what they were given.
<BR>
For as long as they are unable to pay our ancestors back, they will
<BR>
eternally suffer the pangs of guilt knowing that they are not the ones
<BR>
that deserve to inherit the glorious eternal life they were given.  If
<BR>
I make it to that future time, I will always feel lonely without, and
<BR>
indebted to all of my ancestors which are my real creators.  To think
<BR>
that a more intelligent being than myself will have less of such
<BR>
desires, especially logical machines, seems to me to be completely
<BR>
absurd, illogical, and irrational.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about to overcome the evil of all future death and
<BR>
suffering.  That's the easy part.  But, there will still be people
<BR>
that are still dead, the only real &quot;evil&quot; that will remain.
<BR>
Hopefully, as Tippler, Moravec, and others have theorized, we will
<BR>
find some way to achieve the ability to resurrect and eliminate all
<BR>
death that has occurred in the past also.  Then once this chore is
<BR>
complete, then and only then will it be a true and all good heaven,
<BR>
completely absent of evil, for all.  This is everyone's ultimate and
<BR>
real purpose.  Then will we finally be free to have fun
<BR>
seeking to become all knowing, all powerful, and most important of
<BR>
all, all feeling.  As long as there isn't yet an all powerful being,
<BR>
there can still be hope that complete illumination of all such evil,
<BR>
death, separation... might be possible right?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did enjoy his comment:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fate of our species on Earth and our fate in the galaxy seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inextricably linked.
</EM><BR>
<P>but it is so much more than this.  The fate of all beings that ever
<BR>
will exist, and that ever has existed, will always be inextricably
<BR>
linked.  It is true that Good and Bad can both use technology to its
<BR>
various advantages.  But things that are good have an obvious
<BR>
advantage over all that is bad, namely, that which is &quot;Good&quot;, is by
<BR>
definition, that which everything and everyone one wants.  And that
<BR>
which is &quot;bad&quot; is, by definition, what everyone and everything wants
<BR>
to overcome.  Hence, though we should probably proceed with caution,
<BR>
as he suggests, in the end, everyone and everything will finally end
<BR>
up choosing all that is good to overcome all that is bad.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as any of us is missing, as long as any memory is
<BR>
forgotten, as long as any feeling is still un-felt..., no one will be
<BR>
perfect and not somewhat lonely, no matter how intelligent they
<BR>
become.
<BR>
