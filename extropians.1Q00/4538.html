John, you can have such an experience without dying. Go see Dr, Micheal 
<BR>
Pershing and his &quot;Temporal Lobe Seizure&quot; creating equipment in his lab. With 
<BR>
finely tuned magnetics no stronger than common appliances around us 
<BR>
everyday, when placed near the temporal lobes of your brain, he can 
<BR>
reproduce EVERY SINGLE spiritual experience known to humanity from 
<BR>
throughout recorded history.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is fascinating technology!  I would love to visit his lab and under 
<BR>
careful supervision experience the effect for myself.  Do you know of a 
<BR>
website that would tell me more?  Shades of 'Altered States' but without the 
<BR>
sensory-deprivation tank.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Take into account piezo electic phenomenon when rocks are deformed or when 
<BR>
we come near strong magnetic fields associated with geological formations 
<BR>
and this, for me, explains spiritual phenomena. Especially ghost stories 
<BR>
from rock castles. This rationally explains spiritual phenomena like the old 
<BR>
hag, the feeling someone's in the room with you, visions of angels or devils 
<BR>
or aliens, experiences akin to near NDE...and on and on and on. People that 
<BR>
are extremely susceptible to these experiences are creative people and 
<BR>
people considered artistic. It's all just in our heads!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I see this explaining SOME spiritual phenomena.  I have heard how the 
<BR>
creative and also the mentally ill (who are sometimes both) are more 
<BR>
suseptible to hallucinations.  I still believe in nde's as presented by at 
<BR>
least some who have experienced them but I am glad you shared this with me.
<BR>
<P>I read awhile back how the wind can sometimes whip through holes in old 
<BR>
decrepit buildings, and if the nature and size of the hole(s) was just right 
<BR>
it could create a sort of ultrasonic freqency that can induce very fearful 
<BR>
feelings and hallucinations in people!  No wonder people say the howling 
<BR>
winds around old houses scare them!
<BR>
<P>Also at the moment of falling asleep, a person can lucid dream without 
<BR>
realizing it and think they are awake and experiencing some form or another 
<BR>
of bizarre attack.  The brain's mechanism for holding the body will kick in 
<BR>
and this makes them feel paralyzed against their will.
<BR>
<P>I will not accept sweeping generalizations against all stories of 
<BR>
supernatural religious experience, flying saucer sightings and abductions, 
<BR>
nde's or hauntings.  I believe that for many of the claims there are mundane 
<BR>
scientific explanations, or they are frauds and  delusions, but there are 
<BR>
those accounts which are actually true.  I try to keep an open mind and look 
<BR>
at the arguments of both sides.  And I think there are some very 
<BR>
close-minded people on both sides of these matters that won't look at what 
<BR>
the other side is trying to put forward.
<BR>
<P>Again James, thanks for the information about Dr. Michael Pershing.  I look 
<BR>
forward to learning more about his work.  If his technology hit the streets, 
<BR>
you would have Nancy Reagan on tv saying, &quot;just say no when someone offers 
<BR>
to let you put a hallucination-inducer on your head!!&quot;  Those will be 
<BR>
followed by ads with William Shatner, since he wrote the 'Tekwar' series!!  
<BR>
In an agonized capt. Kirk tone of voice he will say, &quot;please, please, just 
<BR>
don't do it!&quot;  And the police would be carefully watching local electronic 
<BR>
supply stores to see if they were fronts for the big organized crime gangs 
<BR>
based in Silicon Valley! :)
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John
