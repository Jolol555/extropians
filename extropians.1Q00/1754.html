Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P>I don't know if you saw this news item from a couple of weeks ago.
<BR>
It caught my eye because I _did_ have a pretty bad influenza a
<BR>
few weeks ago, and I _do_ study cosmic dust. However, my first
<BR>
reaction to this news item was &quot;this is really weird, it must
<BR>
be a joke&quot;.  But I'm not a biologist. Do any of these ideas make
<BR>
sense to you biologists out there?
<BR>
<P>Amara
<BR>
<P><P>P.S. The &quot;solar&quot; theory below, I just don't buy. My understanding
<BR>
of radiation pressure forces in the interplanetary space and in
<BR>
planetary magnetospheres is the material would be forced outward.
<BR>
Therefore, this theory linking to heavier solar activity would
<BR>
mean that the radiation pressure forces would blow the dust
<BR>
outwards _more_ from the Solar System. If these scientists have any
<BR>
science papers on this topic, I would like to see them because
<BR>
maybe I missed their logical link. Have you heard of the journal
<BR>
&quot;Current Science&quot;? My Institute doesn't have that in our library.

<BR>
<P>The flu outbreak which has struck down tens of thousands of sufferers
<BR>
may have come from outer space, according to scientists based in
<BR>
Cardiff.
<BR>
<P>The flu outbreak which has struck down tens of thousands of sufferers
<BR>
may have come from outer space, according to scientists based in
<BR>
Cardiff.
<BR>
<P>Astronomers at the University of Wales are challenging the view that
<BR>
the outbreak was caused by the bug being passed from person to person.
<BR>
<P>Instead they blame the spread of the illness - which brought many
<BR>
hospitals to a standstill - on solar activity which brought cosmic dust
<BR>
into the earth's atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>However, a British expert in viral diseases, Dr Nigel Higson, has
<BR>
described the theory as &quot;very unlikely.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Dust from comets
<BR>
<P>The Cardiff-based team led by Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe believes
<BR>
the dust from comets which passed near the Earth contain either the
<BR>
virus itself or DNA molecules which produce the flu bug.
<BR>
<P>They also claim their solar theory was responsible for other outbreaks,
<BR>
including the 1918 epidemic of Spanish flu which was blamed for 20
<BR>
million deaths worldwide.
<BR>
<P>Their report, called The Dilemma of Influenza, is due to be published
<BR>
in the journal Current Science.
<BR>
<P>Prof Wickramasinghe claimed the theory could also help health managers
<BR>
prepare for major outbreaks of disease.
<BR>
<P>Solar activity link
<BR>
<P>&quot;It could help predict epidemics because there is a very short space in
<BR>
time between a peak in solar activity and the effects reaching us here
<BR>
on earth.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It has never been proven that a virus such as the flu can be passed
<BR>
from one person to another,&quot; said Professor Wickramasinghe.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Instead, we believe these outbreaks are caused by particles in the
<BR>
stratosphere coming down to the earth's surface.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;What we are getting from the high atmosphere, be it a virus or a
<BR>
genetic trigger, is significantly more dangerous than anything we may
<BR>
catch from other people,&quot; he added.
<BR>
<P>Theory discounted
<BR>
<P>But Dr Nigel Higson, Chairman of the Primary Care Virology Group, said
<BR>
it was &quot;very unlikely&quot; that individual flu outbreaks could be linked to
<BR>
dust from outer space.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Humans are not the natural host for flu, it tends to be found in birds
<BR>
where it can change very quickly, before being transmitted to the human
<BR>
population through close contact,&quot; said Dr Higson.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I can't prove or disprove the theory that flu comes from space - but
<BR>
it doesn't affect the management of a virus wherever it comes from,&quot; he
<BR>
added.
<BR>
<P>Dr Higson said further research was being carried out to establish how
<BR>
flu viruses are spread from one individual to another.
