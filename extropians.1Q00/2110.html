The recent comment re: &quot;Incompetent People Really Have No Clue, ...&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2058.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2058.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Is worth a read for people who didn't see it.  It points out
<BR>
one of the reasons many people on the list (who are presumably
<BR>
pretty competent), keep bumping their heads against the reality
<BR>
that exists in the world.  I see it *a lot* in Russia where
<BR>
you may have very educated people who will intelligently discuss
<BR>
space, medical progress and subjects that can best be attributed
<BR>
to Russian history/mysticism (lets say palm reading or astrology)
<BR>
in the same conversation, seeming to apply the same relative
<BR>
&quot;reality merit&quot; to them.  Unfiltered &quot;reality&quot; acceptance has
<BR>
to be the flip-side of the coin of &quot;reality&quot; rejection (by those
<BR>
who are &quot;incompetents&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now, that brings us to the question of how do you promote &quot;longevity&quot;
<BR>
given the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that this is impossible.
<BR>
<P>Tim Ventura (<A HREF="mailto:TVentura@illuminet.com?Subject=Re:%20Writing%20Letters%20and%20Incompetent%20People&In-Reply-To=&lt;389c54ec0.4ed7@aeiveos.wa.com&gt;">TVentura@illuminet.com</A>) posted a nice suggestion:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are we just so much mush--sitting around and telling each other how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great transhumanism is? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Here, here!!!  It takes not only &quot;dynamic optimisim&quot; but dynamic *action*,
<BR>
on both the personal level (e.g. signing up for cryonic suspension or
<BR>
actively doing research in these areas or contributing to the appropriate
<BR>
organizations) *and* a group level (running local transhumanist groups, or
<BR>
educationg people in your family or at work and dealing with that nasty
<BR>
messy thing called politics).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wrote to the whitehouse today (you can get there from www.whitehouse.gov)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and asked Al and Tipper to de-regulate biotech when he takes office, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he probably will--because I'm just not seeing the progress from George W. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Al is a pretty tech-lit guy but there are questions as to whether
<BR>
he is in the pocket of Big Pharma.  So there people have a basis for
<BR>
discussions with their friends, family &amp; politicians, I'll offer some
<BR>
comments on how to move this forward.
<BR>
<P>a) Support the Life Extension Foundation (www.lef.org).  Saul is doing a good
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job applying the profits they make from supplement sales to fundamental R&amp;D.
<BR>
<P>b) Educate yourself about and invest in biotech.  Everything from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geron's cloning research to the many companies working on both
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angiogenesis promotion (for working around clogged coronary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arteries) and blocking (to stop cancer growth).  There are many
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more examples.  Find those topics of interest to you or your family,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learn about them, and support research in those areas.
<BR>
<P>c) View Big Pharma (and biotech turning into big Pharma, such as Celera
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be) as a double-edged sword.  On the one hand they conduct a lot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of research and expand our knowledge base, but they rarely have the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective of &quot;how can I give this patient one treatment that &quot;fixes&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this problem forever?&quot;.  Ultimately we have to work in that direction.
<BR>
<P>d) Support government funding of basic research.  Small companies can't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do much of this and that which is done by Big Pharma is generally private.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small companies have to rely on government or investor support and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investors are looking for short term ROIs.  The more of such support
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is the more research we will get that ultimately comes together
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an understanding of aging and treatments for it.
<BR>
<P>e) Support moving the FDA from a gatekeeper to an Underwriters Laboratory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type of organization.  There are a lot of scam artists still in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world (as a trip to the A4M meetings will show).  At the same time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people die for lack of access to advanced treatments (e.g. all the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people that might benefit from angiogenesis inhibitors that are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unavailable because they are still in &quot;trials&quot; waiting for FDA approval.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smart individual in a non-critical situtation should be able to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use only FDA approved substances.  At the same time, people should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have the freedom to take risks with unapproved materials (or even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be stupid, since the Web makes it easy for the FDA and watchdog groups
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to publish counter-stupidity material).  We need to move from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Big Daddy says...&quot; to &quot;Uncle's advice is...&quot;.
<BR>
<P>f) Educate yourself, speak about life-extension as &quot;gravity&quot;.  Engage
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people in the conversation and break up those mental memes that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say it &quot;cannot happen&quot;.  Discuss with people why they would not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentally want to live thousands of years in relative luxury.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't want to do this, go for the jugular of why they are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not happy with their life.  Expect them to squirm and wriggle.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, ask them what they are doing to prepare for their 1000'th
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birthday party.  Exhaust their arguments one by one until they flip.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they flip get them to sign up for making it happen sooner.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being gravity is important -- once you get past the fact that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will happen, then the only thing that is important is how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many people we lose before we get there.
<BR>
<P>There is relatively little &quot;regulation&quot; of biotech at this time that
<BR>
is slowing down progress, other than that required for &quot;prudent&quot;
<BR>
laboratory practices (we don't want to kill workers by accident).
<BR>
As Clinton's recent proposals moving against Internet pharmacies
<BR>
shows, the Democrats can from time to time get sucked into being tools
<BR>
for the medical monopolies such as the AMA.  (Internet pharmacies promote
<BR>
peoples' choices, lower the barriers and costs to access to drugs, are
<BR>
good for Big Pharma, but bad for local M.D.'s.  Most importantly, the
<BR>
current proposals increase the power of the Federal Goverment and the FDA
<BR>
and that probably should be avoided.)
<BR>
<P>Finally, there is at least one pro-medical choice lobbyist in Washington D.C.
<BR>
They played a role in previous legislation (the Hatch bill?) to protect
<BR>
consumer choice with regard to supplements (something the FDA is testing
<BR>
the limits on).  They are currently pushing for legislation along the
<BR>
lines of (e) above.  Unfortunately, since they are pro-choice, they
<BR>
also find themselves supported by, or in the company of, some rather
<BR>
dubious types of medical practicioners.  If you want to know more
<BR>
about supporting the legal aspects, you should probably contact the
<BR>
People's Medical Society (www.peoplesmed.org) or the A4M
<BR>
(www.worldhealth.net).  Unfortunately neither site seems to have
<BR>
obvious links to &quot;legislative&quot; agendas, so you you have to probably
<BR>
contact them directly for such information.
