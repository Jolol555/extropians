<EM>&gt; We need people who have theological training to develop a whole theological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis (in several religions) for extropic concepts, and get them promoted in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both the religious and mainstream press. Once this is in place, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to the theological 'high ground', and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will be seen for what they truly are: oppressive luddites.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; This is an interesting thought.  It's good to understand where the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person's perspective on things so you can better communicate with at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the possibility of making a positive connection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By having knowledgeable and compassionate individuals trained for what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire, it would be possible to gain positive impressions from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memberships.  This way, especially in a roundtable discussion, you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop goodwill rather then animosity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But you may be going to far in saying that the theological &quot;highground&quot; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be at least partially taken to the point where religious leaders will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen as oppressive luddites!  If they are really against a certain thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will demand membership to &quot;close ranks&quot; and rally round interpretations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of core doctrines.  They are the religious leader in touch with God
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; according to their group and not you, and so they can do this.
</EM><BR>
<P>The point is though that if it is seen that there are two alternate and opposing
<BR>
ethical arguments, then we don't automatically secede the ethical authority to
<BR>
them, and rational people will feel that its ok to choose between the two
<BR>
alternatives.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would rather not have this happen because of a &quot;us vrs. them&quot; mentality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where people are labeled and then treated in a certain way.  This has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already been discussed extensively on the list.  We may not be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control their actions but we can control our reactions.  Being understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and level-headed in public forums will take transhumanist views much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farther.  I think Max and Natasha are good examples of trying to do this in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mass media.  And for now, they along with Robert Bradbury, Nick Bostrom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a few others, are the one's who are dealing head-on with these issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and doing the best they can.
</EM><BR>
<P>When the luddites have already started the us vs. them argument, its noble, but
<BR>
not very effective, to pull the 'turn the other cheek' strategy.
