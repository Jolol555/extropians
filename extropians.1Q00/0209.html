<P>Commenting on Randy Smith's message:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was the point of my &quot;Message&quot; exactly. Does membership in this group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commit me to the support of what some fraction of current Extropians happen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to espouse?
</EM><BR>
<P>Abosolutely not.  If you can make a rational argument for disagreement
<BR>
with a large fraction of the &quot;group&quot;, then I think most self-proclaimed
<BR>
group members would support you in having that position even though
<BR>
they might disagree with it.   In the final run, the disagreements would
<BR>
probably come down to differences in fundamental assumptions or probabilities
<BR>
of various outcomes.  In these forums, I think we can find common ground
<BR>
in agreement to disagree and respect those disagreements until such time
<BR>
as someone comes up with better evidence or arguments for supporting one
<BR>
case or another.
<BR>
<P>While I'm unsure of the &quot;transhumanist&quot; perspective, I am clear that
<BR>
that the Extropian perspective places a high value on rational debate.
<BR>
Rational debates allow a questioning of assumptions and extrapolations
<BR>
of positions based on assumptions that may not be &quot;confirmable&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I think all within this group are free to cite those assumptions which
<BR>
the consider valid and those that they question.  A majority agreement
<BR>
with an assumption in no way constitutes &quot;validity&quot; demanding minority
<BR>
agreement.  In fact, within this group, I would expect that any majority
<BR>
would embrace any minority opinions for the simple reason that they
<BR>
must be able to respond to the question &quot;But, what if you're wrong?&quot;.
<BR>
In this forum, being wrong may doom us all.  So if I am wrong, I'm
<BR>
extremely enthusiastic about recanting if someone from one of the
<BR>
minorities can show me that is the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I happen to feel strongly opposed to it, do you honestly feel I hold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this view on statistical grounds, so that I will be dissuaded by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force of mere numbers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely not.  You especially, I would expect to hold a position based
<BR>
on careful consideration of the arguments.  If 17 Joe Shmoes come along and
<BR>
disagree with you, all it means is that I must examine the arguments
<BR>
in more detail.  If 17 Robert Owen clones come along and disagree with
<BR>
you, then I might tend to side with the clones on the weight of my
<BR>
respect for their known relative intellectual capabilities.
<BR>
<P>Unqualified numbers are meaningless.  Numbers of relative meritability
<BR>
are significant.  Membership in a group where you self-select in
<BR>
does not constitute &quot;relative meritability&quot;.  It only says that you
<BR>
have an open mind and are willing to listen to rational arguments.
<BR>
(In contrast, non-membership may be an indication that one is unwilling to
<BR>
listen to rational arguments or willing to listen to irrational arguments.)
<BR>
<P>Only observation and experience indicate the quality of the arguments
<BR>
and therefore the degree to which they should be accepted.  One of
<BR>
the things I liked about the Wall St. Journal article, was that they
<BR>
talked to Sasha and Max and Natasha and I -- while we have similar
<BR>
opinions, we have reached them through different rational paths.
<BR>
<P>However, as I have argued before, Joe Q. Public, does not have the time
<BR>
or in some cases the education to research the details required for
<BR>
accepting things like G.E. foods.  In those cases we should be very
<BR>
open about providing access to the logic, papers, rationale, etc.
<BR>
But to be efficient about this we must also provide our informed
<BR>
opinions or viewpoints.  In those cases where others disagree we
<BR>
should not hesitate to point this out.  It is only by forcing
<BR>
the debate into public discussion that we may educate each other
<BR>
sufficiently to come to rationale conclusions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I joined this group, there was no understanding that I was appointing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it my proxy or my public ideological representative, authorized to speak for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me on social and political issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nor is there that assumption, IMO.  I personally, on matters relating to
<BR>
philosphy would refer queries to you or Max, just as I might refer questions
<BR>
art &amp; other subjects to Natasha, politics &amp; genders to Kathryn, law to
<BR>
Greg, economics to Robin, physics to Hal or John, etc.  In a forum of rational
<BR>
debate, one refers people to those who are more informed on various topics
<BR>
than oneself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, shouldn't that be &quot;Transhumanist/Extropian?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Most likely.  I would think EIsm is a subset of THism because THism
<BR>
would seem to be more generic.
