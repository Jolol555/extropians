<P>
I think I estimated here recently that medicine contributed about
<BR>
one year to life expectancy over the last century or two.  Let me
<BR>
revise that to perhaps two years.  I just read and considered:
<BR>
<P>Bunker, John P; Frazier, Howard S; Mosteller, Frederick (1994):
<BR>
Improving health: Measure effects of medical care.
<BR>
The Milbank Quarterly 72(2), 225-258.
<BR>
<P>This paper estimates the gains in US life expectancy from various
<BR>
specific medical treatments, including immunization and screening.
<BR>
Adding up all the items for which they estimate ranges gives a total
<BR>
range of 4.9 to 5.5 years.  Four items contribute the most by far, so
<BR>
we can add it up this way:
<BR>
<P>Item            Min Mos.  Max Mos.    Date Innovation
<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------
<BR>
smallpox           3         6          1800
<BR>
diabetes           6         6          1920
<BR>
diphtheria        10        10          1950
<BR>
heart disease     14        14         &gt;1950
<BR>
all the rest      25        29          Misc.
<BR>
---------------------------------------------
<BR>
Total             59        66
<BR>
<P>I'll accept diabetes, but take issue with other three,
<BR>
and take issue with just taking them literally.
<BR>
<P>On diptheria, Bunker et al credit medicine with the
<BR>
entire fall since 1950, even though the US death rates
<BR>
from it continued to fall after 1950 at about the same
<BR>
rate they fell before 1950.  The 1999 US Stat Abstract,
<BR>
chart #1423 says deaths per 100,000 were:
<BR>
<P>1912 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980
<BR>
139  139  82.1 54.1 30.8 11.8 14.1 3.8  1.2  0.5  0.1  0.2  0.1  &lt;.05
<BR>
<P>On smallpox, the question is what the death rate would
<BR>
be today had medicine never intervened.  It seems natural
<BR>
to suppose that smallpox death rates would have fallen
<BR>
dramatically to near zero today just as did all the other
<BR>
once deadly contagious diseases lacking substantial
<BR>
medical prevention.
<BR>
<P>On heart disease, I just don't see that we have data tying
<BR>
it to medicine.
<BR>
<P>Finally, these numbers assumes that people who die of a
<BR>
disease were otherwise just as healthy as the people who did
<BR>
not die of it.  Since I don't believe this, I will knock off
<BR>
1/3 from the total result.  So I'll accept an estimate of
<BR>
(2/3)*(27+10) months, or 22 months life expectancy gain from
<BR>
medicine.
<BR>
<P>The paper also discusses contributions of medicine to quality
<BR>
of life, rather than just mortality.  So I'll note that an
<BR>
analysis, <A HREF="http://papers.nber.org/papers/W6895">http://papers.nber.org/papers/W6895</A>, of quality-adjusted
<BR>
life improvements 1970-1990 finds that &gt;80% of the total
<BR>
improvement is from lifespan changes, with &lt;20% due to other
<BR>
quality of life contributions.
