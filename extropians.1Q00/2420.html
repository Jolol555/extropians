<P><EM>&gt; Now, if you believe it is feasible, but are not signed up, then you

<EM>&gt; leaving your frozen head to me, so I can harvest meme-sets from it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if you don't believe it will work, given the analysis that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are thus far available, it seems you have some internal demons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to wrestle with.  You can't simply say you want &quot;proof&quot; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it *will* work, you have to *assert* that it can never work.
</EM><BR>
<P>You know, the knee-jerk &quot;Cryonics is a necessity&quot; theme that some folks have on 
<BR>
this list has always annoyed me. Frankly, I think that cryonics IS is a good 
<BR>
last-ditch solution to terminal diseases. Now, the question is, how much should 
<BR>
I be willing to give up for that chance of being frozen if suddenly struck 
<BR>
down? Clean air? Clean water? A low crime area? Financial independance?  This 
<BR>
is the cost that *I* look at as the cost of cryonics. In order to take 
<BR>
advantage of cryonics (which is almost non-existant in Canada) I would have to 
<BR>
move to a place where crime is an order of magnitude higher, (ie a big US 
<BR>
city), and where life spans are ten years or so lower, and sign a life-
<BR>
insurance policy at rates which would no longer permit me to live off of 
<BR>
chemical-free foods. Is this statistically the best thing for me to do to 
<BR>
maximize my life expectancy?  I think not.
<BR>
<P>For once I would like to see a Cryonics fan give an assessment of what folks 
<BR>
have to GIVE UP in order to join the ranks, and how it would be worth it. For 
<BR>
example, if in the next 10 years, a fantastically expensive immortality drug is 
<BR>
created, will the money spent on a Cryonics policy still seem like it was the 
<BR>
best bet?
