<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I find it shocking that most of American population would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered criminals if the things they do were known - according
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the laws they collectively support.  This is no different from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any other repressive regime.  Actually, in some that I know, most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people actually believed the gov't.  In U.S., they don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many people in the US simply prefer to forget about government, and get on with
<BR>
their lives. You might view this as hypocritical, since the US advertises itself
<BR>
as a democracy, but if this cognitive dissonance works, if it does keep
<BR>
government out of personal life, then it will just have to do, until a real
<BR>
apolitical society comes along.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(I like reminding people that out of millions of animal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species, humans are the only one who have any problem seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each other naked - and this is entirely the consequence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;warped social norms.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps so, but then again, I really, really don't want to see the US Congress
<BR>
without clothes.
<BR>
&lt;Yech! Bleech! Puke! Gag!&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The laws contradict each other and don't make any sense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The examples are too numerous to list.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps all laws should contradict each other and make no sense, because the
<BR>
more that happens, the more people can ignore laws, and freedom prevails.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't think the current U.S. population would ever *be able*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to live in openness in the mildest issues.  They are all so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brainwashed and warped they'll have to die without ever seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ouch! You have a valid point there, I think. Who has done this nasty thing to
<BR>
the US population? Did secular government do it? Or is it that the people who
<BR>
founded this country (yeah, I live in the US), were religious fanatics with
<BR>
guns? When you try to separate the Church from the State, it pisses off the
<BR>
Church more than reasonable people may appreciate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd venture to define violence as depriving people of free choice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of their experiences.    U.S. gov't applies violence to everybody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- to the extent that people don't even know anymore what they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feel if they were free.
</EM><BR>
<P>People don't know anymore what they would feel if they were free -- and not
<BR>
taking psychedelic drugs to feel it.
