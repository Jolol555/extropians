</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Lets look at the number of cameras in a total ubiquitous open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveillance system:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Range of average camera(at useful resolution): 50 m radius
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Field of view: 90 degrees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Area under surveillance by 1 camera: ~7500 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Area of dry surface of Earth: 148,300,000 square kilometers or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 14,830,000,000,000,000 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Number of cameras necessary to cover every square meter of the dry land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the planet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the vast majority of those cameras would be pointing at a place where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there aren't any humans, vehicles or robots and so would be worthless. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly universal surveillance system (obviously I agree no system will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfect) could get by with a tiny fraction of that number of cameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly if the cameras are mobile.  As for cost, already today you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get an (admittedly rubbish quality) web-cam for less than £50, and at that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price it wouldn't be exhorbitantly expensive to have every room in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; house under surveillance. (You may be relieved to hear that I don't have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plans to start webcasting Meonthetoilet.com any time soon :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Good to hear. However, the fact that a camera isn't pointing at anything
<BR>
doesn't mean it won't be on the network, and won't be getting data
<BR>
downloaded from it by automated filter/analysis systems, and won't be
<BR>
taking up bandwidth. Moreover, a current day web-cam is of pathetic
<BR>
quality as an instrument of surveillance. Additionally you brought up a
<BR>
factor that would INCREASE the number of cameras on the network:
<BR>
enclosed areas. For example, my apartment is less than 100 square
<BR>
meters, yet I would need 5 cameras to cover it all on the interior, so
<BR>
there would be many billions of areas of suboptimal coverage where you
<BR>
would need overlap. My original calculation was that  there was optimal
<BR>
area coverage and camera utilization.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If that level of surveillance is possible today, I don't think it's a huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stretch to postulate a future system which could cover not just your house,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but also shops, businesses, public areas etc and at significantly higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality than the best available  today. Sure, if you decide to go hiking in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the middle of nowhere there won't be any cameras, apart from those you bring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with you (or ones which follow you if we soup up the tech a bit).
</EM><BR>
<P>However, this system would be totally dedicated toward security, nothing
<BR>
else. Most people wouldn't care to spend more than 1-5% of their annual
<BR>
income on personal security. You are talking about a system that would
<BR>
cost several times the entire GDP of the planet to build and maintain on
<BR>
an annual basis. Cameras wear out, cameras get destroyed by weather, and
<BR>
by people who don't want to be seen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which if you treat each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; camera as a network device on an internet like system, would require a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; network a minimum of approximately 150,000 times larger than the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worldwide internet (but only if you have nothing BUT cameras on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; network, no servers, routers, or clients), and is 20 times greater than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the capacity of the IP number system's maximum capacity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I said, I think your numbers may be inflated with a lot of redundant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras, but even if they're not, I wouldn't like to bet against the future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existance of a network 150,000 times the size of today's net. Lucent have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already made a cable which could accomodate all of North America's voice and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I think) data traffic at once.
</EM><BR>
<P>If optimally used, and that is just voice and data. Video bandwidth is
<BR>
several orders of magnitude fatter. I was simply talking the number of
<BR>
nodes, but if you wanna talk bandwidth, we can go there as well. The
<BR>
numbers favor me evem more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; routers and clients for each of the 6 billion members of the human race,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this should add at least another 50 billion IP addresses to the network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; assuming that you can put a couple thousand cameras on one router, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one server can handle a million or so cameras at once.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Now lets say we use Zero's Rules as a filtration protocol, recapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Notify me whenever:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) someone accesses any of my banking data;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) one of my listed sworn enemies (a) purchases a weapon (b) comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 200 yards of my person (c) comes within two blocks of my house (d)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any of my data or (e) speaks my name; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) anyone is watching me by remote surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) seems to be pretty easy, and is more of a network/database function
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a camera function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2) The enemies list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a) purchases a weapon: unless you have evidence that shows a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threat of imminent harm, then I don't see how you could claim a right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this information, however, it is easily obtainable enough by adding some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reporting functions to the NICS database system already in place. In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; instance of private sales, any video footage showing a gun in a 2 foot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proximity to an 'enemy' would be sufficient, assuming that the weapon in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; question actually looks like a weapon, and that the system is capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; delineating between dinner knives and a combat knife, a pen and a pen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun, a hand raised in greeting and a hand poised to strike, a walking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cane or a beating cane (or a cane with concealed sword or gun), and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; able to xray a person and determine if the person has a weapon concealed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on their person...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; b) comes within 200 yds of Zero's person: This is less difficult than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; monitoring all cameras, so long as your system knows your GIS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; coordinates at all times, and the GIS coordinates of all enemies at all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; times, video feeds would only be neccessary to make sure that its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actually an enemy and not someone wearing the enemies ID chipset in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; effort to confuse and bollux up your complex defense network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; c) much like (b), only a limited number of cameras need to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; monitored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; d) accesses any of my data: This is a toughie, because you really have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no idea where in the world any of 'your data' is at any gien moment, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you really have no control over what other people do with 'your data'. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; may query your bank info once, then resell it a million times through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; encrypted channels, unless you want to do away with encryption as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (not likely to happen).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; e) speaks my name: Ok, then we are adding microphone devices to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; network, so the number of IP addy's needed is now double what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; calculated for just video feed, and you need voice recognition software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is totally foolproof with all languages and accents and speech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; impediments ( plus you'll need video sign language translators that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; read the couple dozen different sign languages), AND these applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will need to be context sensitive to be able to discriminate between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone actually referring to you, and someone giving a mathematics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lecture, or reading a comic book aloud...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I basically agree with most of this, but I think you're attacking a bit of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straw man in e).  The system wouldn't have to be totally perfect to at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a reasonable chance of catching your name, particularly if it only has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to monitor your &quot;sworn enemies list&quot;.  In fact this is possible today - if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can persuade your sworn enemies to permanently wear a radio mike linked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up to a computer with the latest speech-to-text software.
</EM><BR>
<P>The less discriminating it is, the more hits it will feed back to the
<BR>
user. The more hits it feeds back will increase the paranoia level of
<BR>
the user.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3) Anyone who is watching you by remote surveillance: relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; impossible, as with microtechnology, 'remote surveillance' could be any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bug, bird, etc. that doesn't need to be on your perfect network, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would need to be able to trace their line of sight communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (another physical impossibility) to their own encrypted private network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; break their encryption, and track the signals to the GIS coordinates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; through any number of other devices or networks that would be stripping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and counterfeiting ID data on the packets, of one of your enemies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But given the technology required for universal surveillance, it should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; comparatively easy for everyone to have a gizmo strapped to their wrist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; monitoring vital functions which would trigger an alarm (and nearby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the event of their demise. Any murderer would be caught &quot;on tape&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; police would converge on the location immediately. Even if some kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; poison was used, you could simply rewind the video from the victim's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; personal camera, find the point when their food was tampered with and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; nail the murderer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He added:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; First you are assuming that a camera with 360 degree field of view in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; both the x/y and x/z coordinate planes would have sufficient resolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to record that info, that the persons system would not have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pre-emptively EMPed by a person wishing to do them harm, and that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; person wishing to do them harm is either trackable by their own unit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (which they likely won't be wearing) or identifiable in video.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To carry on the poisoner example, Let's say the poisoner is president of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Magic Circle (and therefore adept at slight of hand, used to concealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things from cameras and a master of disguise). He slips something in my food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the waiter brings it from the restaurant's kitchen.  Despite all this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact that he walked right past my plate just before I was served (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then keeled over dead after my first bite) would be registered by the Crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Analysis Computer. The CAC could then rewind the tape, tracking his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movements backwards (perhaps over several cameras, or via his own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camera(s) until the point when he's putting on his fiendishly clever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disguise, identify him and send round the cops. (Or if it's looking at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical footage, fast forward whilst tracking him to his current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; location). Obviously it's all a bit late for me personally, but the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high probability of retribution is likely to be an effective deterant to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; committing of the dastardly deed in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you are assuming that he would be inserting the poison in your food
<BR>
in an area that is covered by what you've admitted will be a suboptimal
<BR>
system (not likely). You are also assuming that the act will be
<BR>
performed by the individual themselves, rather than by an autonomous
<BR>
agent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for EMP and most other camera disabling technologies (all those where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network knows the camera has been disabled), presumably this would trigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate alarms, which would probably cause me to, at the very least, stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eating and be on my guard (and probably take further defensive action if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was the sort of person to have a sworn enemies list :). In any case I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presume that the act of disabling a camera in a public place (or on someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else's property) would itself be a crime and footage just prior to the zap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would probably be enough to identify the zapper (or at least place them on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the scene).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, if the technology was good enough to have a personal mobile camera
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; covering everyone then anyone who disabled their own camera (prior to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime) would be inviting suspicion and might automatically be tracked by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other cameras as they pass. Yeah, we're talking a lot of computing power and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory (but hands up anyone who doesn't think future capabilities in these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; areas won't dwarf today's).
</EM><BR>
<P>Dwarfing todays total global capacity for ONE application? I don't think
<BR>
so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Incidentally, I'm not saying that this kind of surveillance capability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't make me uncomfortable, but if such a system manages to prevent some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religious nut from wiping out humanity before I can grow a diamond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space-ship and head for my nano-engineered asteroid utopia then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (admittedly big) bad points might be worth it.
</EM><BR>
<P>THis is the worst weasley argument to make. The paradox of this argument
<BR>
is that:
<BR>
<P>a) your perceptions of crime and our trust in humanity today are based
<BR>
upon the lowest common denominator
<BR>
b) the lowest common denominator is a low paid, low intellect, low
<BR>
educated lowlife.
<BR>
c) at the same time, you claim to hold the transhumanist ethic that
<BR>
technology will lift up and improve the lives of all people, increasing
<BR>
their intelligence and capacity to learn, and access to knowledge and
<BR>
information. 
<BR>
d) that your perceptions of crime are based on the lowest quartile of
<BR>
the population, while your expectations of the future population reflect
<BR>
the highest quartile.
<BR>
e) you are assuming that the transhumanist trends will make human beings
<BR>
better people, but when it comes to crime you assume that they will
<BR>
become the worst possible human beings.
<BR>
<P>This is the perceptual dissonance in the arguments for total
<BR>
surveillance that makes it not only distasteful for me, but IMHO exposes
<BR>
the hypocrisy of the people who beleive in it. (besides the fact that
<BR>
the person arguing for total openness the most on this list right now
<BR>
wont' post his real name or location, how hypcritical is that?)

<EM>&gt; at a certain distance, it doesn't seem a great leap to imagine future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems which have a 3d scan of the criminal (or whoever) and can recognise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them from the side, in motion and wearing a false nose. Again the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't be perfect but I think it could get pretty reliable. - there's already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software which can recognise people solely by the way they walk (and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand it's fairly hard to fool).

<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyway, one comment, in case someone hasn't brought it up.  Imagine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ubiquitous surveillance is just around the corner, what things do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be used to counteract it?  There're always ways to fake out any

<EM>&gt; &gt;sow propaganda of suspicion about the system, and denigrate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;integrity of the system, and the popultion will dismantle the system for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you. Put out enough autonomous agents of your own that are built to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bollux up the system, and the system will be degraded to the point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;uselessness. This is pretty basic stuff, right out of standard SpecWar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and/or ChiCom insurgency manuals.... tho updated for the new technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The tactics of warfare never change, only the weapons and the targets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Current network security / anti-virus stuff may not be great (far from it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in fact), but it is improving and even at today's standard I doubt any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual or organisation would be able to totally take out the internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short of launching a lot of nukes (and even then there's likely to be some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survivors in a bunker somewhere who'll still be able to play Quake). If this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is true today, I imagine future systems are likely to be less rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more vulnerable to such attacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>As chips drop their operating voltage to get greater processing for less
<BR>
power consumption and heat generation, they actually become easier to
<BR>
EMP. Taking the babyblanketnet out completely is not necessary to make
<BR>
it useless. An extended campaign to simply corrupt the reliability of
<BR>
the information it put out, and produce areas of spotty coverage, will
<BR>
cause people to lose faith in the system and refuse to pay for its
<BR>
upkeep.
