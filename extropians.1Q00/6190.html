<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330045846.29906.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This might not seem like a lot of work, but we don't have a computer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that's capable of detecting anything you list in (2) without a human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;pre-analyzing the data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I never said the system should or could be implemented &quot;today.&quot;  AI 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very well solve this problem.  Even so, I don't think it would really be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that difficult to solve even with today's technology.  My list of sworn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enemies would be finite (quite small actually).  You could do it with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of software agents.  One agent assigned to follow each of the enemies on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; list.  When any one enemy did one of the trigger events, the agent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reports back.  Would that really be so difficult to engineer?  I don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;  YES.  REALLY.  Take my word for it for chrissake.  :)  A list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enemies will not suffice: you have to figure out how to write down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;function that takes grids of numbers and spits out a 1 if it's a picture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of one of the enemies on your list and a 0 otherwise.  This is a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complicated function which nobody can write down today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using AIs here is the application of a magic genie that will solve all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your computational problems.  A genie like that might not WANT to solve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all our problems; it might just decide to do its own thing or figure out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the meaning of life or what have you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tell me it is *impossible* and I will shut up.  The mere fact that its not 
<BR>
easy does not make a hill of beans difference to me.  It wasn't *easy* going 
<BR>
to the moon. If it can be done, at some point or another somebody will throw 
<BR>
enough money and enough programmers at the problem to get it done.  The fact 
<BR>
that nobody has done it yet, or that *you* don't see a way to do it does not 
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I think the problem is that you are thinking of the system as &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer.&quot;  Sure it would have to be one *massively* parallel box to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all those requests and all that data.  But guess what?  Coming soon to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; planet under you will be a distributed network of intelligent devices of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kinds.  Think intelligent, networked, and communicating observation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reporting hardware devices, think innumerable software agents all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; back to you according to your instructions, think distributed networked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computing, think &quot;system&quot; as opposed to &quot;the computer&quot; and it should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; easier to grasp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Doesn't matter.  Put emphasis on the &quot;massive&quot; and you see what I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;getting at.
</EM><BR>
<P>But even a hugely massive problem becomes manageable when tasks are broken 
<BR>
up and distributed.  The bigger the problem, the more hardware and software 
<BR>
you throw at it.  If you have every machine on the planet working to break 
<BR>
it there is no such thing yet as an unbreakable code.  You have to admit 
<BR>
that at *some* level of computational power the problem can be solved.  I 
<BR>
think you'll also have to admit that at some point in the future that level 
<BR>
of computation will be reached.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
