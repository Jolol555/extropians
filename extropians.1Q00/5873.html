<P><P>Having lived near a grain dump, I can attest to the enormous quantities of

grain that are dumped every year.  I have no idea what the exact quantity

is but I am pretty sure that the U.S. dumps over a million tons of grain
<BR>
each year.
<BR>
<P>How would you define &quot;efficient and equitable&quot; distribution of the dumped
<BR>
grain?  Grain is a true commodity; the reason it is being dumped and left
<BR>
to rot is that the markets for selling it are saturated i.e. there are no
<BR>
more buyers.  Being an easily renewable resource, it makes far more sense
<BR>
to dump the excess than to further depress the market by selling below
<BR>
cost or giving it away.  In other words, meddling in the grain market will
<BR>
produce a situation that is even worse than exists now.
<BR>
<P>A far better way to solve the hunger problem is to fix the broken
<BR>
economies of these starving countries (and the governments that created
<BR>
them) so that they can afford to buy U.S. grain.  This way the buyers
<BR>
would benefit in general and the producers would benefit from an expanded
<BR>
market.  While one could argue that a better solution would be to improve
<BR>
local agricultural production, I think that in many cases competing with
<BR>
the production efficiency of the U.S. agricultural industry simply to
<BR>
have local production is a futile effort and not a useful application of
<BR>
resources in the long run.
