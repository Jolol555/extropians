<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How do we act differently now, knowing that we could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  getting videotaped, any where, any time?  Eventually you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  know some yahoo is going to invent a mechanical robofly that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  can carry a camera and microphone into your home, thru the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  AC vent or something.  Would that affect the way we act?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  It is suddenly a privacy advantage to be a nerdy nobody.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
On the one hand, I think
<BR>
<EM>&gt;a consensual society of free individuals governed by law would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unworkable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a world where one could not CHOOSE to conduct some of one's affairs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without observation, or at least where observation was an infringement of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etiquette, ethics and/or law.  On the other, I was forced to consider just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how much time and money gets spent in legal &quot;swearing matches&quot; about what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said by whom in a particular meeting or what happened when in some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unexpected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;event like an accident giving rise to a tort claim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What if the default presumption was that all of one's business affairs 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be recorded by all involved?  What if the default presumption was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the operation of every piece of equipment in a construction project 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was being recorded?  The vast majority of litigation boils down to &quot;who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said what&quot; and &quot;who hit who&quot; type questions.  If the presumption was that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things would be
</EM><BR>
recorded unless the parties to a transaction agreed otherwise, people 
<BR>
wouldhave to offer a damned good reason to switch off their cameras.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I can't say I've come to any final conclusions, but I have come to a much 
<BR>
less firm opposition to consensual surveillance.
<BR>
<P>At my day job (preparing in-house all the ads, brochures, posters, T-shirts, 
<BR>
the company website and anything else that requires photography, computer 
<BR>
graphics, printing or writing),  which I'm sure is repeated in various 
<BR>
permutations in millions of work places, power struggles are constant and 
<BR>
often unbelievably destructive to the welfare of the company.
<BR>
<P>Anyone who doesn't protect himself and be at least aggressive enough to 
<BR>
scare off the predators of the various warring camps is destroyed.  The 
<BR>
employee burnout and turnover is unreal.  The only way I can do my job 
<BR>
without having it totally perverted into nothingness is to battle dailly.
<BR>
<P>If what I did was an open book, I would be interrupted every few minutes by 
<BR>
some person who had authority demanding that I do something else instead of 
<BR>
what some other authority had told me to do, which would then ensure that I 
<BR>
would be chewed out by the other boss.  Or, one of the bosses would catch me 
<BR>
experimenting with some COREL feature or looking up some JavaScript 
<BR>
construct, or just sitting momentarilly and thinking about how to best do my 
<BR>
job, any of which has been the cause of major dressing downs.
<BR>
<P>When the early '90's recession ended, and, with it, cheap, dispensible 
<BR>
skilled labor, it became more and more apparent that my work was, if not 
<BR>
indispensible to the survival of the company, at least a major factor in 
<BR>
their profitability.  Nevertheless, this behavior continued on the managers 
<BR>
part, and numerous other people who made huge amounts of money for them 
<BR>
walked out at various times.  Finally, I started walking out.  And suddenly 
<BR>
they started treating me respectfully!  So, I continued that behavior - 
<BR>
walking out for the day and leaving critical projects hanging - and their 
<BR>
behavior got even better!
<BR>
<P>Still, it is only by means of taking all sorts of measures to hide what I am 
<BR>
really doing that I can get the critical aspects of my job done at all.  
<BR>
Since the management is in a state of Hobbesian war, they never count the 
<BR>
cost of the labor in doing anything.  I often make sure that jobs take ten 
<BR>
times as long as necessary just to buy time to do the essential stuff.  This 
<BR>
may not last, however, as I am fairly certain that they have now installed a 
<BR>
keystroke monitor.  I am looking for a good job as a security guard - dark, 
<BR>
silent, alone.
