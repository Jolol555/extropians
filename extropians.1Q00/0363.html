<EM>&gt; About 50% of what they bring me is easily the best I've ever had in my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 40% is OK, and 10% is crappy looking.  *Way* better than Safeway and at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least as good as the conventionally grown produce at the local premium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grocery store.

<EM>&gt; I wish they'd irradiate it, though.

<P>Here, here!!  A fine example of an educated consumer.  While there may
<BR>
be some bad press regarding radiation byproducts, I suspect most of it
<BR>
is fear-mongoring.  On balance, the probable risk reduction you get from
<BR>
killing the bacteria would offset any marginal increase in toxin exposure
<BR>
that might come from radiation generating &quot;new&quot; molecules (after all vegetables
<BR>
and many fruit are a chemical soup of natural &quot;pesticides&quot; anyway).

<EM>&gt; My wonderful life extension doctor recommends eating organic.  His arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are outlined in his book, &quot;Renewal:  The Anti-Aging Program,&quot; by Dr. Timothy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Smith.  There are many pages of references for anyone who wants to check out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cites themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't read the book.  However, much of anti-aging &quot;science&quot; is working
<BR>
at the margins.   If they don't make distinctions of relative risks
<BR>
(tobacco &gt;&gt; alcohol &gt;&gt; pesticides &gt;&gt; herbicides, etc.) and lump them
<BR>
all together they are oversimplifying and trying to sell books without
<BR>
giving you a balanced presentation of the data.
<BR>
<P>For people who can afford it, going organic is perfectly fine.  However
<BR>
the probable benefits are probably slightly below taking one-a-day
<BR>
vitamins.  You have to be somewhat careful with organic however.
<BR>
Dr. Ames is fond of quoting the story of the development of a highly insect
<BR>
resistant vegetable developed by one company.  It turned out that it has
<BR>
about 3x the normal level of carcinogenic toxins.  The average consumer
<BR>
eating his nice pretty pest-free organic food has no way of knowing
<BR>
whether the grower &quot;happened&quot; to invent one of these and is serving it
<BR>
up to you.
<BR>
<P>Which brings us to a *very* interesting question.  Is there *any* regulation
<BR>
at all on developing new foods?  Aren't growers/seed companies free to
<BR>
breed anything and market it?
<BR>
<P>So, in theory the logic being applied to GM-&quot;labeling&quot;, re: safety, should
<BR>
be reversed and applied to any &quot;home&quot;/&quot;corporate&quot;-bred varieties as well.
<BR>
Ideally the exact chemical composition of *all* of the foods in our food
<BR>
supply should be available so the complete mutation/cancer-promotion or
<BR>
allergic reaction potential could be assesed by the consumer.
