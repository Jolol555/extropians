<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No, that's justificationalism. Science is about (see above)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  criticizing ideas. . . . Read Bartley's &quot;Retreat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to Commitment&quot; . . . 
</EM><BR>
<P>I would also recommend Radnitzky and Bartley's _Evolutionary Epistemology, 
<BR>
Rationality and the Sociology of Knowledge_ Open Court Press.  In paryticular 
<BR>
page 48, on &quot;the selective elimination model of knowledge&quot; that does not use 
<BR>
justification of facts or &quot;proof.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Here is what I wrote to the sci.philosophy NG:
<BR>
--------------
<BR>
Epistemology is the theory of knowledge,  why we believe what we believe.   
<BR>
To get around blind faith justification is: &quot;simply _don't_ use justification 
<BR>
as the criteria for knowledge.&quot;
<BR>
<P>. . . In stead, as Sir Karl Popper wrote in his (1963 first ed., 1989 fifth 
<BR>
ed.)  _Conjectures and Refutations_, scientific knowledge (such as theories) 
<BR>
are conjectures (hypothesis) and peer reviewed criticism.  The wider the peer 
<BR>
review the better (as Kuhn suggested in his (1998) _Objectivity, Value 
<BR>
Judgement and Theory Choice_).  The process is evolutionary.  This idea grew 
<BR>
from a branch of non-justificational knowledge: Evolutionary Epistemology 
<BR>
(EE). 
<BR>
<P>Details of the EE concept:
<BR>
A science theory starts as an informed guess (hypothesis: inductive or 
<BR>
deductive, rational-istic or empirical-istic) based on what is known at the 
<BR>
time (background scientific knowledge).  Then, the hypothesis get combined in 
<BR>
a self-organizing web of knowledge during the peer review process of 
<BR>
criticism in the form of questions and tests the original author(s) then 
<BR>
answer (e.g., experiments, mathematics, logic essays) either satisfactorily 
<BR>
or not. 
<BR>
<P>The surviving theories are inductively accepted even if the theories 
<BR>
themselves were deductively reasoned. The famous &quot;problem of induction&quot; is 
<BR>
still present, that even the survivors could be wrong and modified or 
<BR>
overturn someday.  But, contrary to the &quot;Greek styled Skeptics&quot;  theories are 
<BR>
not self-justified based on blind faith.  Even more, theories are never fully 
<BR>
justified as &quot;fact.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>. . . But we _can_ look at if the theory is logically consistent, 
<BR>
self-contradictory, reproducible by empirical experiment, accurate, broad 
<BR>
scope for purposes of unifying knowledge (possesses the property of 
<BR>
&quot;consilience&quot; or &quot;reduction&quot; with other branches of science), consistency, 
<BR>
simplicity, and the ability to lead knowledge in new (hopefully better) 
<BR>
directions.
<BR>
<P>Notes:
<BR>
This non-justificational evolutionary epistemology is called: Pancritical 
<BR>
Rationalism (PCR) which is a synonym for comprehensively critical rationalism 
<BR>
(CCR) (see Bartley, _Retreat to Commitment_  below).  Actually, I prefer the 
<BR>
name CCR, over PCR (because I am a microbiologist where PCR means polymerase 
<BR>
chain reaction, a procedure to amplify DNA and genes). 
<BR>
<P>CCR derived from the work by Sir Karl Popper, William W. Bartley III and 
<BR>
Donald Campbell.   You could say CCR emerged out from the ideas that EE 
<BR>
addressed, as a solution to the problems raised by the Greek Skeptics.  
<BR>
<P>CCR needs both conjecture and criticism if our knowledge is to grow. 
<BR>
<P>Before CCR, Popper had the first answer, called critical rationalism (CR).  
<BR>
The problem was that CR was seen as having an irrational reliance upon 
<BR>
rationality!  Rationality is something most scientists take for granted, that 
<BR>
is that rationality is better than irrationality.  However, once the 
<BR>
consequences are seen by choosing _both_ (rational and irrational) approaches 
<BR>
to science, one can be chosen rationally over the other (guess which one) 
<BR>
because one works better.  (Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend would probably 
<BR>
disagree.)
<BR>
<P>However, the only way this choise can be made _without_ recourse to 
<BR>
justification (again), is through criticism of the choice! CCR must criticize 
<BR>
itself!  Thus this is the answer to the NG postings conjecturing that &quot;one 
<BR>
can not question one's own questioning.&quot;  The answer is not only that &quot;Yes 
<BR>
you can,&quot;  but also that &quot;Yes, and you must&quot;  (or more correctly . . . the 
<BR>
process of CCR _will_ force itself upon you and almost spontaneously) if you 
<BR>
are using non-justicicational evolutionary epistemology. 
<BR>
<P>Example of self-criticism of CCR:
<BR>
Can a critical argument discrimination between true and false without the 
<BR>
logical law of non-contradiction?   I think any sane person would agree 
<BR>
non-contradiction is required for critical arguments (even the &quot;value&quot; 
<BR>
oriented Kuhn? and the anarchistic Feyerabend?).  If one finds a 
<BR>
contradiction in an argument, it had better be corrected, explained 
<BR>
satisfactorily, or the other side of the argument gets stronger.  Yet, in CCR 
<BR>
non-contradiction is conjectured to be essential to argument but _not_ a 
<BR>
self-evident &quot;fact.&quot; This illustrated the big difference between 
<BR>
justificational and non-justificational philosophies.  When the law of 
<BR>
non-contradiction is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; in CCR no alternate idea can beat it.  
<BR>
That is, anything else to replace is not accepted and non-contradiction is 
<BR>
accepted because it has (so far) survived over (selected over) the 
<BR>
alternatives.   Everyone agrees to use it as a basis for deciding truth and 
<BR>
fallacy.  It is a tool of evaluating criticism and choosing theories that are 
<BR>
&quot;better.&quot;   This can be done with every idea, so no blind faith justification 
<BR>
is needed.

Worked Cited:
<BR>
Bartley, William W.  III. _The Retreat to Commitment_.  Second ed.  Open 
<BR>
Court Publishing. 1984.   This book seemed too religious for me at first 
<BR>
(i.e. it seem to be about the history of how irrationalism destroyed the 
<BR>
Protestant philosophy and the resulting ups and downs during the past 150 
<BR>
years.  Yet, the real purpose of the book is to introduce CCR in the 1962 
<BR>
first edition (re-named PCR in the 1984 second edition).  It is basic 
<BR>
evolutionary epistemology. 
<BR>
Radnitzky, G. and William W. Bartley, III.  Eds. _Evolutionary Epistemology, 
<BR>
Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge_ Open Court Publishing. 1987.  
<BR>
This is a collection (anthology) of several evolutionary epistemology 
<BR>
philosophers, also some &quot;cognitive&quot; psychologists.  This book shows how ideas 
<BR>
evolve by a kind of Darwinian natural selection and improvement over older 
<BR>
(e.g., refuted) ideas.  I have not read this book but I get referred to it a 
<BR>
lot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Internet references (The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy):
</EM><BR>
&quot;Karl Popper:  Karl Popper is generally regarded as one of the greatest 
<BR>
philosophers of science of this century. He was also a social and political 
<BR>
philosopher of considerable stature, a self-professed `critical-rationalist', 
<BR>
a dedicated opponent of all forms of scepticism, conventionalism, and 
<BR>
relativism in science.&quot;
