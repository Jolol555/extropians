<P>
I found the observations by Queenemuse quite perceptive on what some teens 
<BR>
might find most appealling in terms of the classic, medieval Heaven and Hell 
<BR>
scenario.
<BR>
<P>At least the impression I got as a kid was that being physically tortured 
<BR>
for all eternity would not be fun and so I did not want to wind up there.  I 
<BR>
remember how as a young boy my mother would have me watch the Billy Graham 
<BR>
crusade.  At the beginning would be a cool and very short cartoon showing 
<BR>
people going to Hell when a trapdoor underneath them at judgement day opens 
<BR>
up and then they are chased around by classic looking demons with horns and 
<BR>
pitchforks through winding tunnels.  This was my favorite part of his 
<BR>
program!  He no longer runs this.
<BR>
<P>Actually, the way I visualized Heaven was a place without all the 
<BR>
frustration, death and pain of this world.  A place where everyone had 
<BR>
material plenty and was deeply loved and cared for.  Definitely different 
<BR>
from the nice but dull Catholic church I attended as a young kid.
<BR>
<P>Now, a really delinquent kid might be like the main character of, &quot;A 
<BR>
Clockwork Orange&quot; and fantasize about being one of the bad guys having a 
<BR>
great time being bad!  I still remember how I felt sorry for the main 
<BR>
character when he got out of prison and went home to find his old 
<BR>
gangbuddies are now cops and just as bad as ever.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>

Yeah... I mean even take a look at the two images the biblical artists 
<BR>
giveus: Consider Hell: naked people being gorged with food, brimstone, 
<BR>
torture chambers, forced todo things against their will, sex orgies, demons, 
<BR>
fire, hobgoblins, etc., etc.Now let's look at Heaven:downcast eyed, pious, 
<BR>
dour people in uncomfortable pews, praying or signinghymns, kneeling on hard 
<BR>
wood- and everyone, even the guys, wear the samewhite dresses.Now if anyone 
<BR>
has ever spent hours on their knees as a kid in those awfulpews, wishing it 
<BR>
would, but secretly believing it would never end..um.... which do you think 
<BR>
would a normal, healthy hot blooded kid choose?; - )
