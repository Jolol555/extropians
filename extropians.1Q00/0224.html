In a message dated 00-01-04 15:34:01 EST, you write:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Another category:  terrorist organizations.  There are a number of groups
<BR>
&nbsp;currently active which are making physical attacks on scientific labs and
<BR>
&nbsp;harassing scientists.  The most prominent that I know of in the USA are
<BR>
&nbsp;PETA, the Animal Liberation Front, and Reclaim the Seeds.  In Europe, 70
<BR>
&nbsp;labs researching genetically engineered crops have been attacked.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Groups like this can have a chilling affect on research.  I used to work in
<BR>
&nbsp;an entomology department, and no one there would do flea and tick research
<BR>
&nbsp;because they were afraid of animal rights groups.  (Fleas and ticks require
<BR>
&nbsp;mammalian hosts.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Recently an animal rights group claimed to have sent out envelopes to
<BR>
&nbsp;scientists booby-trapped with razor blades:
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ampef.org/news/jd_release.htm">http://www.ampef.org/news/jd_release.htm</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;More of the same:
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ampef.org/alfhits.htm">http://www.ampef.org/alfhits.htm</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;While I agree with the points made earlier that we should try to consider
<BR>
&nbsp;every opponent a potential ally, people who have resorted to the use of
<BR>
&nbsp;violence and vandalism are beyond reason.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;/XMP&gt; &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Actually, I would classify terrorist groups under &quot;Anti-Transhumanism&quot; as 
<BR>
such groups do not practice tolerance or non-coercion, even though many of 
<BR>
them are likely to be completely unaware of transhumanism.
