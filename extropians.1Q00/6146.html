Re: The &quot;two pills scene&quot; in &quot;The Matrix&quot;
<BR>
<P>I've enjoyed the threads on &quot;The Matrix&quot;,
<BR>
and agree that, like most SF movies, it
<BR>
had significant technical flaws.
<BR>
(Batteries?!?!?!?)
<BR>
<P>The continued emphasis on the &quot;two pills
<BR>
scene&quot; on this list has moved me to point
<BR>
out something that will only make sense to
<BR>
people knowledgable about Joseph Campbell's
<BR>
ideas about mythology and what he called
<BR>
the &quot;monomyth&quot;: the &quot;two pills scene&quot; is
<BR>
a classic &quot;threshold of the adventure&quot;
<BR>
scene. The decision Neo is presented with
<BR>
in the scene was whether or not to refuse
<BR>
the &quot;call to adventure&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In fact, the whole movie fits Cambell's
<BR>
&quot;monomyth&quot; formula so well that it's almost
<BR>
as if the filmakers were doing it intentionally,
<BR>
as Lucas did with the first Star Wars movie.
<BR>
This might be why the film seemed predictable.
<BR>
<P>One twist was that the &quot;realm of
<BR>
adventure&quot;, which is often some enchanted
<BR>
realm outside of ordinary reality (&quot;Oz&quot;,
<BR>
etc.) was, in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, ordinary reality
<BR>
itself, as opposed to the virtual world of the
<BR>
Matrix in which Neo grew up.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;two pills scene&quot; was Neo's last
<BR>
chance to turn away from the adventure
<BR>
and stay within the confines of the
<BR>
world that he knew.
<BR>
<P>Had he backed down, according to Campbell,
<BR>
he would either have become a tragic figure,
<BR>
reduced to an existence without meaning
<BR>
because he had refused his true calling,
<BR>
or something bad would happen to force
<BR>
him to change his mind. (Like when Luke
<BR>
Skywalker's aunt and uncle were killed by
<BR>
stormtroopers after he refuses Ben
<BR>
Kenobi's request for assistance.)
