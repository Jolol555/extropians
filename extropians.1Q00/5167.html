<P>
some observations about an interesting debate ...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems that the crux of the problem here is not logic, but intuition
<BR>
-- and ultimately, emotion. den otter and yudkowsky, both products ofevolution,
<BR>
have imperfect knowledge; but both believe that they know something fundamental
<BR>
about reality. indeed, as human beings, no one could do better. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the debate revolves around the creation of a _power_ -- an entity that
<BR>
has no further charactrization than near infinite power and incrutability. to
<BR>
den otter, an inscrutable power, at the very best, is neutral to human beings.
<BR>
that is, we can only regard its potential actions as random. from this
<BR>
perspective, a _power_ is little different from an detonating fusion bomb. at 
<BR>
the worst, den otter fears that the continuance of existence is an universal
<BR>
goal of all existent entities, and as such, may direct the _power_ to pursue
<BR>
the extermination of human beings as an explicit subgoal. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yudkowsky, on the other hand, contends that the potential actions of a
<BR>
_power_, while uncertain, is not random even from the present human
<BR>
perspective. his intuition is that something resembling morality is embeded in
<BR>
the deep structure of reality; therefore, a sufficiently intelligent being
<BR>
would have access to that knowledge and entertain a chance of preserving
<BR>
humanity. every agrees that the reasoning of a _power_ would be 
<BR>
incomprehensible to any human being -- one would have no way of verifying its
<BR>
motives -- only through a priori knowledge of the fabric of reality could one
<BR>
retain some peace of mind in the presence of a _power_.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is clear that the logic of both sides are nearly flawless;
<BR>
however, the premises are inductively derived and not subject to algorithmic
<BR>
analysis. i'm fairly certain that the premises are self-evident to their
<BR>
respective authors, but self-evidence is evolution's quick-fix to limited
<BR>
knowledge; at some level, somethings just feel &quot;right&quot; to some and &quot;wrong&quot;
<BR>
to others ... a fundamentally emotional evaluation ... subject to
<BR>
individual experience, genetic makeup, and all the other evolutionary
<BR>
sludge.
