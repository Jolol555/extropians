<EM>&gt; &gt;Similarly, if a market said a given treaty made war more likely the treaty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could not be approved on the justification that it would keep us out of war,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thought it might be approved on other justifications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The natural response of those who negotiated the treaty would be that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have nonpublic information which is better than the market's information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I said on another list (on the subject of corporate board decisions): ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To which you responded: ... expect them to publicly declare their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       best estimate, and to bet a lot for it.  If speculators don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       believe them and move the price to their estimate, I think it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       reasonable to say the decision should go with the market estimate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       not with what the board says is its estimate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the case of treaties, I suspect that negotiators will find some hard-to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-analyze argument for secrecy (based on ethical problems with insider trading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and/or on the desire to prevent other nations from knowing how badly our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government wants the treaty).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, I'd expect people to offer hard to analyze arguments against my 
<BR>
proposal.
<BR>
They might even be right.  But I'm not sure what more I can do besides make a
<BR>
proposal and respond to the arguments people actually make with the best
<BR>
analysis we can muster.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;3) Choose some official national objective function, something like GDP,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;only more carefully measured and trying to include more contributions like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the value of leisure, etc.  Have some independent and well monitored agency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;continually update this estimate of the state of the nation.  Then have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says that among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all the decisions markets are considering (including letting policy makers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;do what they want), D gives the highest conditional estimate for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;national objective.  I think this is the most promising approach.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Given the problems experts have agreeing on how to quantify relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well understood things like inflation, I wouldn't expect much agreement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about how to quantify something for which you don't even have a name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd expect that measuring the value of unowned things like Linux or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whales would be more subject to political manipulation.
</EM><BR>
<P>We already measure GDP, and I suspect just using futarchy based on GDP in
<BR>
fifty years time would probably result in a better government than we have
<BR>
now.  If so, any improvements we make on better measures beyond GDP just
<BR>
make futarchy even more attractive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I don't think a single official measure is wise. I'd prefer to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handfull of different measures (an economic growth indicator, an inequality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indicator, a leisure indicator, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>But then you couldn't have a simple constitutional decision rule like
<BR>
the one I proposed.
