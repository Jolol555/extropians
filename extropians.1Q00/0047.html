<EM>&gt; &gt; This is not as much as a &quot;Duh!&quot; as you think.  It is was currently believed

<EM>&gt; &gt; that DNA defines an animal's appearance and much of its personality. These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clones had identical DNA and different egg cells.  The egg cells were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought to be empty containers to hold the DNA.  Now that the animals look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and act different, it appears that DNA is not the end-all blueprint that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought it was.  Apparently, much of the animals definition comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; non-DNA sources.

<P>One should always be able to revisit hypotheses.
<BR>
<P>There are several things that I, far from an expert in this field, can
<BR>
think of that don't require &quot;non-DNA sources&quot; (or more precisely, non-NA
<BR>
sources):
<BR>
<P>1) Mitochondrial DNA. This has been handwaved about before. I had my
<BR>
doubts long ago that one should call an organism a true clone if it
<BR>
didn't have identical mitochondrial DNA. Not unlike calling Y2K the
<BR>
Millennium, we appear to be stuck with the misnomer. I propose calling
<BR>
what we have today &quot;loose cloning&quot;, and getting *all* the genetic
<BR>
material as right as possible, &quot;tight cloning&quot;.
<BR>
<P>2) Increased mutation rate due to yet-undetermined factors in the
<BR>
current procedures. There is nothing that says the DNA sampled is
<BR>
error-free and 100% representative of the animal it was taken from.
<BR>
<P>3) Differences in expression of existing genes due to methylation and
<BR>
other only-recently-discovered factors. See #2 above.
<BR>
<P>4) Retroviruses present in the ova.
<BR>
<P>5) Then there's the telomere-shortening problem. I can imagine different
<BR>
clones aging at different rates.
