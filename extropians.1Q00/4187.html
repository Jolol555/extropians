<P><EM>&gt; I'm afraid I can't completely share your optimism, at least initially. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things on the Extropian agenda could potentially come under legal purview.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian groups have been shown to be highly effective lobbyists, and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not been hesitant to block the approval of medical innovations which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenged &quot;traditional values.&quot; Good examples of this would be RU486, late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; term abortions, and assisted suicide. And the problems won't be just with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evangelists. The bozos that were sounding the alarms about the UPC code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and remember Ronald Wilson Reagan = 666?) weren't the same heavy hitters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (e.g. bishops and leaders of major denominations) that would get into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fray when you start talking about totally redefining basic terms such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;life&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; and even assigning god-like attributes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines. Various legitimate ethical questions will undoubtedly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approached from biblical perspectives, as absurd as such a juxtaposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may seem, which could well have at least a da!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mpening effect. Like it or not, the religious types are very effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizers, and can do much to influence our freedoms. I think we'd better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get really used to hearing the accusation &quot;playing God.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The reason why this sort of thing happens is that rational people are loathe to
<BR>
delve into theology, which is the memespace that these arguments originate from,
<BR>
and so the reactionaries are conceded the originating territory from which they
<BR>
can assail progressive concepts. Activist extropians must first wash out their
<BR>
distaste and take an active part in the theological debate, do no concede that
<BR>
territory from the start. With such predecessors as Teilhard des Chardins who
<BR>
originated their Omega Point theories completely within the context of theology,
<BR>
our concepts are not strangers to religion. We need people who have theological
<BR>
training to develop a whole theological basis (in several religions) for
<BR>
extropic concepts, and get them promoted in both the religious and mainstream
<BR>
press. Once this is in place, the reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to the
<BR>
theological 'high ground', and they will be seen for what they truly are:
<BR>
opressive luddites.
