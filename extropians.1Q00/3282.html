like

<P>This topic has been the subject of inventive and various science fiction
<BR>
scenarios for years, and this is one place where I suspect the (somewhat
<BR>
disciplined) imagination of sf writers might be as good a guide as anything
<BR>
an engineer or psychologist might come up with. So we have everything from
<BR>
the grandiose VR worlds of the insanely rich in Bill Gibson's NEUROMANCER
<BR>
novels, to the Voodoo AIs in those same novels, to Neal Stephenson's
<BR>
somewhat morphable consensus world in SNOW CRASH (not uploaded
<BR>
consciousness, but cognate), to the rather plodding version in Tom Easton's
<BR>
SILICON KARMA, to Iain M Banks's FEERSUM ENDJINN, and on and on...
