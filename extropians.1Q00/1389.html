<P><EM>&gt;Second, perhaps we need to discuss what I'm trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diagrammatically represent.  Think of it as similar to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;square of opposition representing not logical relationships
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but relationships among belief-systems, dominant and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recessive personality traits, and ideological group dynamics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Quite a bit for one diagram -- maybe TOO much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's a lot for one diagram.  More specific
<BR>
diagrams would certainly be easier to discuss
<BR>
and analyze.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [3] Thus &quot;atheism&quot; and &quot;nihilism&quot; are related as points on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       continuum -- a very different relationship.  The diagram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       shows how an ideological tendency can pass through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       series of stages, contiguous elements representing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       modification of each other but not a negation.  If, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       example, Atheism is a denial of the supernatural, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       Nihilism takes this much farther to a denial of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       supernatural AND the natural (or secular). But nihilism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       is not a conversion of atheism, but rather an significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       amplification or magnification of a common tendency.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since my philosophy is rusty,
<BR>
I checked my dictionary for defs of &quot;nihilism&quot; and
<BR>
found 3 very different definitions (i.e., there's
<BR>
more than one philosophy under that particular 
<BR>
umbrella).  The one that seems closest to your
<BR>
definition is &quot;which denies any objective basis
<BR>
for truth, esp. moral truths&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You can say that they are related because they both
<BR>
deny something.  I would measure relationships between
<BR>
different belief systems more on shared denials and
<BR>
shared tenets.  Just about any system denies something
<BR>
and holds something else.  Even if you say that 
<BR>
&quot;belief in God&quot; is a subset of &quot;objective basic in
<BR>
truth&quot; that is a awfully small subset.
