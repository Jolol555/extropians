<P><EM> &gt; I agree that in the long run we will probably be entities of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; pure thought, but during the evolutionary period, I don't think
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't know what we will be. We don't know whether discrete
<BR>
individuals will still exist, whether we will have a hierarchy of
<BR>
metaindividuals of all scales, or we all dissolve into a structureless
<BR>
freely diffusing meme soup, filling up all available substrate. It is
<BR>
also certainly not under individual control (i.e. for me/you to
<BR>
decide), but a result of a coevolutionary drift. We don't know whether
<BR>
diversity will be amplified or eradicated. We don't know anything. Big
<BR>
surprise, huh?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; many would survive a situation in which they went from being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; embodied to disembodied overnight.  You lose a *lot* of &quot;hooks&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're just noninteracting (VR wraith), but retain your body image,
<BR>
then you are soon bored. Extremely bored, perhaps enough to wax
<BR>
psychotic. If you just simulate the brain as a self-contained,
<BR>
isolated unit, then you'll start hallucinating real soon, and be a
<BR>
virtual vegetable after a few subjective months/years, assuming no
<BR>
further stabilisation constraints.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; on which concepts based on sensory experiences rest.  Question:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; what fraction of language(s) would you lose if there were no
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; physical &quot;senses&quot;?  (colors, sounds, positional concepts, perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; some emotions, etc.)  They might be replaced by physical science
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; specifications or mathematical representations but that requires
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; training in quite different perception and throught processes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; than most of us currently have.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
But there are physics of computation originated constraints, which do
<BR>
not let you decouple entirely from the underlying physical
<BR>
reality. You can't slow down your clock too much, or you go extinct.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Until we develop a meme set and a language (object exchange protocols?)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for the disembodied, I think we are going to have to retain the illusion
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of having bodies.  You, Eliezer, are perhaps on the cutting edge
</EM><BR>
<P>We are visual beings, and we use linear phoneme sequences for
<BR>
communication. These will probably persist for a while.
<BR>
<P>Of course golems will have probably other means of communication. In
<BR>
ALife experiments coevolving robot colonies develop their own
<BR>
languages.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; of considering what may be required for these representations and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; exchanges.  I would suspect that 90+% of people who consider themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; transhumanists haven't thought very much about this problem perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in part because it is so hard to think about while we are still stuck
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in bodies.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not hard, it is impossible to think about.
