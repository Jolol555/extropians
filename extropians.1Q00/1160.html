<EM>&gt; I would hazard that those neurotransmitters that cause such an emotional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaction to abortion would be those that cause emotional reactions in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general. Blocking them, or as I understand you, removing them from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equation of your mental make-up is tantamount to &quot;roboticizing&quot; your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought processes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Removing the emotions entirely might tend to make one sociopathic
<BR>
and that presumably is undesirable.  Now, on the other hand strengthening
<BR>
the rational mind and giving it a stronger &quot;no/no-go&quot; link to the
<BR>
emotional centers of the mind would seem to be a good thing.
<BR>
Fleeing from the lion on the savannas of Africa is a good thing.
<BR>
Starting a brawl in a bar in Moscow when some Russkiis have had
<BR>
a few too many drinks and call Americans bad words is not (at
<BR>
least most days...).
<BR>
<P>The mental studies I've done in the past give my rational mind
<BR>
a fair amount of seniority over my emotional mind.  That doesn't
<BR>
mean that I don't enjoy giving the emotions free reign once in
<BR>
a while but does tend to mean part of me is always on the lookout
<BR>
for something I might regret later.  The brain is a multi-processor,
<BR>
you can use it as such if you want.
<BR>
<P>Along those lines, that part is always *questioning* the emotions --
<BR>
&quot;Is there a point to that emotion?  Is it useful? Does it make life
<BR>
more fun or provide some meaning? etc.&quot;  But I realize the emotions
<BR>
don't &quot;mean&quot; anything and they should not be allowed to drive the car
<BR>
without an adult present.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Life isn't lived in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vacuum, and rather than try and create one in my mind, I think I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be better off through integration and understanding of my emotional,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less rational heritage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well put.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What this indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me is that the scope of this problem (abortion) is so vast that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should try to take into account all thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions when attempting to decide as a society what the best course of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; travel into the future should be.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  There is little difference between an abortion and an SI
<BR>
deciding to terminate the program of a sub-SI and erasing all
<BR>
memory of it.  And the jury is still unresolved on that problem.
