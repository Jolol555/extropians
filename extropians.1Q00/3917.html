(((I urge you to donate some of your computational/networking 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources to the Freenet project, even if it's a single xDSL
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box. Details how to help see Latest News below.)))

<P>&quot;I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though
<BR>
she's too young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I
<BR>
worry that 10 or 15 years from now, she will come to me and say
<BR>
'Daddy, where were you when they took freedom of the press away from
<BR>
the Internet?'&quot; -Mike Godwin

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Latest News 
<BR>
<P>18th Feb 2000 - Now is your chance to help Freenet is now in its
<BR>
testing phase, to facilitate this we need people who can run a Freenet
<BR>
node on their computers. To participate you will need a computer
<BR>
capable of running java 1.1 which has a permanent connection to the
<BR>
Internet, a fixed IP address, and is not behind a firewall. If you
<BR>
have access to such a beast and would like to help the Freenet project
<BR>
please click here for instructions on how to install a Freenet server.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;What is Freenet? 
<BR>
<P>The Freenet project aims to create an information publication system
<BR>
similar to the World Wide Web (but with several major advantages over
<BR>
it - see next section), where information can be inserted into the
<BR>
system and associated with a &quot;key&quot; (the key is normally some form of
<BR>
description of the data such as &quot;freenet source code V1.0&quot;). Later
<BR>
anyone else can retrieve the data using the appropriate key. In this
<BR>
respect it is a little like the World Wide Web which requires a &quot;URL&quot;
<BR>
to retrieve a particular document.  To participate in this system
<BR>
users will simply need to run a piece of Java software on their
<BR>
computer, and optionally use a client to insert and remove information
<BR>
from the system.  Anyone can write a client (or indeed a server)
<BR>
however the reference implementations will be written in Java.  If you
<BR>
are interested in why someone might want to create a system like
<BR>
Freenet please take a look at the philosophy page.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Why is Freenet interesting? 
<BR>
<P>Click on any of the following reasons for more information about each:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freenet does not have any form of centralised control or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administration 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be virtually impossible to forcibly remove a piece
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of information from Freenet 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both authors and readers of information stored on this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system may remain anonymous if they wish 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information will be distributed throughout the Freenet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network in such a way that it is difficult to determine
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where information is being stored 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can publish information, they don't need to buy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a domain name, or even a permanent Internet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of information will increase in proportion to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the demand for that information 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information will move from parts of the Internet where
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is in low-demand to areas where demand is greater 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;What is Freenet's current status? 
<BR>
<P>Much of the server is complete, and a command line client (which is
<BR>
developed in parallel and shares some code with the server) is also
<BR>
nearing completion. As of 8th Feb 2000 the following remains to be
<BR>
done:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some minor changes to message behaviour 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix hashing on Liberator (a contributed Perl
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of a Freenet client) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement tunneling (a mechanism which will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dramatically improve Freenet response times) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed up handshaking mechanism (which will also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improve response times) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct a wide-scale multi-node beta-test (at present
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most tests have been conducted by running several nodes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the same computer). 
<BR>
<P>You should subscribe to the announcement mailing list to be informed
<BR>
of major releases (this is a low traffic mailing list).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Can I help?
<BR>
<P>Yes, definitely. If you have Java programming experience, or are
<BR>
familiar with cryptography then you will be particularly useful, but
<BR>
everyone is welcome. If you just want to find out more make sure you
<BR>
have read everything on this site - and then join the General mailing
<BR>
list. If you are keen to contribute, first take a look at the code in
<BR>
CVS, then you should join the Development mailing list and let us know
<BR>
what you think you can do.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Why implement the first Freenet server in
<BR>
&nbsp;Java? 
<BR>
<P>Because: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java is the most cross-platform language currently
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are free Java implementations available such as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaffe, we will ensure that Freenet is always compatible
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with these versions even if Sun attempt to make it more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult for free Java implementations to keep up. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java has excellent network support 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java is easier to debug than other languages such as C++,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this lets us get on with the business of implementing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freenet quickly and reliably!
