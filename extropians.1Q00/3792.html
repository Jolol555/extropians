<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; Freezing is largely nondissipative.  No. Disagree strongly here.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It doesn't matter how strongly you disagree; this is basic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; physics.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I guess this does mean you don't know your basic physics. 
<BR>
<P>No. There is nothing simple about the freezing process in animal
<BR>
tissue. The numbers of researchers are few (in toto about 250). There
<BR>
are no good detailed models, especially molecular and mesoscale. There
<BR>
is little published data.
<BR>
<P>I hate to argument from authority, but what are your credentials? You
<BR>
must have obviously spent years of study in the matter, and be a
<BR>
well-known cryobiologist with years of experience to be able to speak
<BR>
in such a strong voice of authority. You seem not to be a member of
<BR>
the Society for Cryobiology. What are your publications? You're not an
<BR>
active poster on Cryonet. I haven't seen you on MURG nor on NEL. I
<BR>
don't recall you from any of the nanotechnology lists. For all I knew
<BR>
you could be a computer programmer, sorry, &quot;software engineer&quot;. Or a
<BR>
&quot;system analyst&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;Though not having to bear burden of proof,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You, like myself and all other posters, bear the burden of proof
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to the extent you want to convince the list of your point of view.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Raising the dead is
<BR>
fairly extraordinary in my book. Let's try to maintain at least a
<BR>
weak pretense of remaining scientific, ok?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; As a practical matter, argument in favor of change from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a traditional technique (in your case, from freezing to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; vitrification) bears more burden of proof.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Good point. But. Get out, and study the literature. Argue from basic
<BR>
physics you're so fond of. You'll find out vitrification is the clear
<BR>
winner. You can argue from ultrastructure, or use such weak, quaint,
<BR>
relatively irrelevant metrics as viability.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; An argument for changing from a faith-based belief in a soul
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to belief in the efficacy of cryonics in general bears
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; very little burden of scientific proof.  The standard of care
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the immortality industry is remarkably low.   The cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; industry with all its warts already meets a much higher
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; standard than most immortality consumers demand.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Because consumers want to believe, obviously. There is a reason why
<BR>
cryonics has been called religion. Perception of the reality and
<BR>
inevitability of your personal demise is evolutionary not a desireable 
<BR>
trait.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Not at all arguing against scientific study -- after all I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consider myself to be a sophisticated consumer and want the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; best science possible for *my* body.  But if the issue
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is the practical consumer choice of signing up for cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; vs. succumbing to the promises of faith-based immortality,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; let's put this &quot;burden of proof&quot; thing in perspective.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This is not about not signing up because chances are slim. This is
<BR>
about using your leverage as a consumer to demand better quality of
<BR>
service. Remember that this is not normal business, because it is so
<BR>
small and selects for weird personalities. You can try to compensate
<BR>
if you're aware of that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; damage Merkle's analysis may be too *pessimistic*: we can often use
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;This is a joke, no?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; No.  MLE is a very inefficient way to solve the problem if one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; instead can solve most of the problem using pattern matching
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; algorithms. (While according to Merkle's analysis we will have more
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't use pattern matching algorithms on mush. Because the
<BR>
resulting structure could have been the result of many, many previous
<BR>
states. You don't have the information to choose which one of them has
<BR>
been the right one. Because that information has become destroyed by a
<BR>
dissipative physical process. Why is your knowledge of simple physics
<BR>
suddenly so selective?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; than enough CPU cycles to do MLE, this is important if for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other reasons, as you argue, the problem is harder than he states).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;The cryptoanalysis analogy is btw perfectly valid if you attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;reconstruct the real thing by monitoring operation (say, using 10^9
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;nanoprobes in vivo), especially if including manipulative measures
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;(exciting subsystems and analyzing their activity dynamics).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It would be even more useful if we had pre-deanimation measurements
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to test against.  SPECT, EKG, and behavior videos may be crude by
</EM><BR>
<P>I was in fact referring to obtaining low-level neurosignatures in
<BR>
vivo, i.e. prior to suspension. Again, such technology is currently
<BR>
unavailable, and is likely to stay unavailable during our remaining
<BR>
life span. Reality is unfortunately quite impervious to wishful
<BR>
thinking.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; future standards, but they provide a substantial amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; information on target neural dynamics that is currently being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lost.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You're deriving sure lots of constraints, but not enough by far. A
<BR>
metaphorical drop in the sea. You want to reconstruct the real person,
<BR>
not somebody a bit like him.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;It's just that a lot of people will die, perhaps all of us here
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;present, if we wait for the advent of this technology (if it indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;arrives, which is far from being guaranteed). Nor is sustainability of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;patient storage guaranteed.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The probabilities are small, but the expected value is vast.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; A finite but still large version of Pascal's wager.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm not into stainless steel personal ornaments. There's a reason for that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;If you thought that typical cryonics patients look bad, don't even try
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;to look at straight freeze. Ugh.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It does not at all matter how they &quot;look&quot; to an eye untrained
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in chemistry *and* computational reconstruction techniques.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Er, I do have a degree in chemistry (including physical chemistry,
<BR>
organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, biochemistry and computational
<BR>
chemistry). My background on computer science is autodidactic, but
<BR>
relatively broad. It includes image processing and some medical
<BR>
imaging. I've spent quite a few thought and shared many a discussion
<BR>
about similiarly minded persons bout using DSP for removing freezing
<BR>
artefacts.
<BR>
<P>To this particular eye, it still looks bad.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;Your stainless steel bracelet does not guarantee salvation.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Certainly not.   That's where we fall back on faith in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Omega point. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;Ischaemia is being adequately addressed, also (especially,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;considering the resources) by the mainstream. Brain vitrification is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;not.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; This is a good point.  I'm not arguing against vitrification
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in favor of freezing.  I'm arguing that it makes very good sense
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to sign up even with the bad-looking freezing methods employed
</EM><BR>
<P>Sign up, now, but demand accountability. Urge your CSP (right now
<BR>
you've the exciting choice of one) to train the personnel and document
<BR>
procedures, doing quality control, doing research.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; today.   It makes good sense to support scientific research
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; into techniques such as vitrification as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeedy. Sorry if I yelled at you, but I'm pretty emotional about the
<BR>
matter.
