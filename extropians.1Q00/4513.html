US preacher finds demon-possessed PCs
<BR>
<P>Forget about viruses and malicious hackers; the real threat these days
<BR>
is far more insidious. Your home computer may be host to a demon, and
<BR>
you and your family may well come under its malevolent control, the
<BR>
Weekly World News reports.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;While the Computer Age has ushered in many advances, it has also opened
<BR>
yet another door through which Lucifer and his minions can enter and
<BR>
corrupt men's souls,&quot; the paper quotes the Reverend Jim Peasboro, author
<BR>
of an upcoming book, The Devil in the Machine, as saying.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Demons are able to possess anything with a brain, from a chicken to a
<BR>
human being. And today's thinking machines have enough space on their
<BR>
hard drives to accommodate Satan or his pals, the paper reports.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Disk capacity is an issue, however. Only a PC built after 1985 has the
<BR>
storage capacity to house an evil spirit, the minister explained.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The Georgia clergyman says he became aware of the problem from
<BR>
counseling churchgoers. &quot;I learned that many members of my congregation
<BR>
became in touch with a dark force whenever they used their computers,&quot;
<BR>
he said. &quot;Decent, happily married family men were drawn irresistibly to
<BR>
pornographic Web sites and forced to witness unspeakable abominations.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;Housewives who had never expressed an impure thought were entering
<BR>
Internet chat rooms and found themselves spewing foul, debasing language
<BR>
they would never use normally,&quot; he declared.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;One woman wept as she confessed to me, 'I feel when I'm on the computer
<BR>
as if someone else or something else just takes over.'&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The minister said he probed one such case, actually logging onto the
<BR>
parishioner's computer himself. To his horror, an
<BR>
artificial-intelligence program started spontaneously.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;The program began talking directly to me, openly mocked me,&quot; he
<BR>
recalls. &quot;It typed out, 'Preacher, you are a weakling and your God is a
<BR>
damn liar.'&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Then the device went haywire and started printing out what looked like gobbledygook.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;I later had an expert in dead languages examine the text,&quot; the minister
<BR>
said. &quot;It turned out to be a stream of obscenities written in a
<BR>
2,800-year-old Mesopotamian dialect!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The minister estimates that one in ten computers in America now hosts
<BR>
some type of evil spirit.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The Reverend advises anyone suspecting that their computer is possessed
<BR>
to consult a clergyman, or, if the computer is still under warranty, to
<BR>
take it in for servicing.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;Technicians can replace the hard drive and reinstall the software,
<BR>
getting rid of the wicked spirit permanently,&quot; he says.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>A 'Net search turns up no matches whatsoever for &quot;peasboro&quot; - which I
<BR>
actually find fairly surprising - and nothing about the book on Amazon. 
<BR>
Still a great story, though.
<BR>
