<EM>&gt; I'm not so sure, infrared photons add to the vibrational energy of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; molecule.  I only think you will get momentum transfer if the photon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is reflected (as in the case of a light sail).  Which raises an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting point, if the photons are always going light speed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they are transfering momentum to the light sail, then, *shouldn't*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the photon being reflected back be of a lower frequency (to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for conservation of energy)?  Hmmmmm...
</EM><BR>
<P>I think what happens is that you can consider the absorption and
<BR>
reemission as two separate events.  From the sail POV, it abosrbs the
<BR>
photon and gets more momentum.  Then it re-emits it at the same frequency.
<BR>
But from a stationary POV the emission is at a lower frequency because
<BR>
the sail is now moving away faster, hence it is doppler shifted downward.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would agree that photons, when absorbed by a gas, increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the energy state of the molecules, but this can be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vibrational or rotational modes in addition to velocity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of the time, I don't think the photons are going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-emitted but instead, the increased pressure of the gas will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfer momentum to the walls of the container which will then radiate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infrared photons as heat.   In the upper atmosphere, I suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you would see gas molecules functioning as a black body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and radiating infrared photons.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, with gas molecules the energy will partition itself among the
<BR>
various degrees of freedom, vibrational, rotational and translational.
<BR>
This then corresponds to the temperature of the gas.  As you say this
<BR>
will heat up the walls of the container as well.
<BR>
<P>I think the basic point with respect to the original question is that
<BR>
it doesn't really make sense to say that a molecule &quot;absorbs energy&quot;.
<BR>
There is no such thing as &quot;energy&quot; in the sense of an immaterial
<BR>
&quot;substance&quot; that can be absorbed.  Energy is the potential to do work.
<BR>
Particles, including photons, can carry energy.  So one way to transfer
<BR>
energy to a molecule is by hitting it with a particle, whether a photon
<BR>
or another molecule.
