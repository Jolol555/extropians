<EM>&gt; &gt; As a disbeliever in patents, this article warmed my heart,

<EM>&gt; As a hopeful inventor can someone explain to me why patents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered bad?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their hard won
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual efforts?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  In a free capitalist society, people should profit from the free
<BR>
exchange of goods or services with other individuals, or any other
<BR>
freely entered profitable contract or dealing.  By contrast, if you
<BR>
obtain a patent, you prevent me, via a state granted monopoly on a
<BR>
particular implementation of an idea, from using my own intelligence,
<BR>
labor and industry to similarly profit.
<BR>
<P>This is coercive, oppressive and destructive, as well as against
<BR>
liberty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is intellectual property worth less because it springs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes so easily from the creative mind?  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>No, make all the profits you want off your legitimate intellectual
<BR>
property.  (Hint -- if your so-called property derives from a grant
<BR>
from the government, its legitimacy is highly questionable.  In this
<BR>
case, it's a government hand out.)  I make profits from my
<BR>
intellectual property -- I write computer programs, and help people
<BR>
integrate other peoples' software into their systems.  These profits
<BR>
do not depend on coercing others into not doing likewise.  That's a
<BR>
bullies' game, not fit for free women and men.
<BR>
