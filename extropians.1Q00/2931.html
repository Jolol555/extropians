<EM>&gt; Normally in these studies they do attempt to control for other variables.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's true, most people who take megadoses of C also take other vitamins,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and may have a healthier diet and lifestyle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on the study, especially on the methodology of the experiment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But these factors are not perfectly correlated.  Some people rely on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swallowing pills and eat like pigs.  Others follow an ascetic diet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and exercise regimen but refuse to take &quot;unnatural&quot; vitamins.  As a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result when you do your statistical analysis you do have some basis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for disentangling the various factors (at least, the ones you know to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check for).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sadly, I've noted such behavior among pill poppers.  I've seen people eat
<BR>
basically McDonald's style food and pop some niacin and a multi, etc.  While
<BR>
I don't know if anyone has studied this intensively, the behavior is
<BR>
prevalent.  A lot of people tend to see supplements as a means to escape
<BR>
from other diet and lifestyle changes.  Why not, e.g., eat junk food, sit on
<BR>
the couch, and just swallow some extra esther C?  It's certainly much
<BR>
easier, if you like that life style, than eating healthy, living actively,
<BR>
and taking supplements.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With a large enough population that it should be possible to draw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusions about the various factors and their effects.  The statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests used by the researchers should show how successful they have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in isolating the various factors affecting health and longevity.
</EM><BR>
<P>You still can't say until you examine the way the experimental and control
<BR>
groups were chosen and monitored.  After all, one could, if one doesn't get
<BR>
a random sample, have one biased toward healthier or unhealthier people.
<BR>
(This seems to be the case with some of the EMF studies.  The people living
<BR>
next to strong EMF sites -- power plants, high tension wires, etc. -- tended
<BR>
to be poorer than average and less likely to have regular medical exams,
<BR>
etc.)
<BR>
<P>Salutations!
