<P>
Here is a charity which is, in my personal opinion, very much deserving of 
<BR>
support: C.R.A.C.K., Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity.  They're at 
<BR>
www.cashforbirthcontrol.com, and the url really says it all.  This 
<BR>
organization will pay drug addicted women and men $200 to sterilize 
<BR>
themselves.  The consequences of this are obvious, and excellent- fewer 
<BR>
crack babies, fewer babies with fetal alcohol syndrome, etc.
<BR>
<P>As someone who has worked in the charity/humanitarian industry for a few 
<BR>
years, I can think of few other organizations more deserving of one's 
<BR>
support than this.
<BR>
<P>I also have a personal stake in this issue- my adopted nephew is an African 
<BR>
American male, born to a drug and alcohol- addicated woman.  My nephew 
<BR>
Joshua was this woman's tenth baby.  All his older siblings had been put up 
<BR>
for adoption immediately after birth, as he was, because the mother was 
<BR>
never in a suitable condition to care for a child.  Of course this didn't 
<BR>
stop her from continuing to get pregnant with assorted men, time and time 
<BR>
again.  When she gave birth to Joshua, the mother was so intoxicated that 
<BR>
she fell off of the delivery table.  Miraculously, Joshua does not have 
<BR>
fetal alcohol syndrome or any other noticable medical problems.  He's only 
<BR>
thirteen months old, though, so only time will tell.  Most other babies of 
<BR>
drug addicted mothers are not so lucky.
<BR>
<P>As far as other worthwhile charities, I also like Grameen Bank and Trickle 
<BR>
Up, both of which specialize in microcredit lending in the third world.  The 
<BR>
charity I worked for, as a volunteer and later as a salaried employee, is 
<BR>
ORBIS (www.orbis.org).  However, for a variety of reasons, I do not 
<BR>
particularly recommend support of this organization.  C.R.A.C.K. is the only 
<BR>
charity I'm aware of which is doing really worthwhile work right here in the 
<BR>
United States.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes to all,
<BR>
<P>Bill Douglass
