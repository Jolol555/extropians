<P><EM>&gt; I had a thought once. What if two black holes began ever so slowly to collide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What effect might one observe as the two event horizons just touch? Assume the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mass of both for sake of argument is exactly equal. Would particles be pulled in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two? This would be difficult for plank sized items, no? Or would they have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fall to one side or the other of the resultant hump left in space between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two dents made in space time? What would determine to which side a particle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; falls? Perhaps this is a foolish thought after all I'm not an expert just an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inquiring mind. Still though, any thoughts?
</EM><BR>
<P>Many interesting things happen when black holes collide (at least 
<BR>
theoretically). One is that the final resulting black hole has an apparant 
<BR>
volume less than the sum of the apparant volumes of the two colliding holes.
<BR>
As for particles being pulled in two, it wouldn't happen. Quantum fluctuations 
<BR>
alone would ensure that the particle went one way or the other. Then again, in 
<BR>
an area of such extreme gravitational stress one would expect to see lots of 
<BR>
spontaneous pair production, one particle of each pair being sucked into each 
<BR>
hole.
<BR>
<P>Finally, there was an interesting science fiction short story in which one 
<BR>
researcher was extracting information from micro black-holes by colliding them. 
<BR>
She was (somehow) intercepting infinitely red-shifted photons that were being 
<BR>
pulled out of one hole and falling into the other, at the exact moment when 
<BR>
their event horizons touched.
