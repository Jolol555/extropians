<EM>&gt; Anyway, I must admit I was confused about something he called a usual error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I understand the sound in space, but I don't understand seeing stars out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; windows...... I would appreciate it if one our more astronomically trained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; members might help with that. Is he saying you can't see stars in space or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what am I missing?

<P>&quot;Bad: In a scene from high above Naboo, we see a fleet of Trade
<BR>
Federation ships
<BR>
silhouetted against the planet, and beyond that the sky is full of
<BR>
stars. 
<BR>
Good: This is a common scene in science fiction movies, but ask yourself
<BR>
a
<BR>
question: have you ever seen anything like it in real life? The answer
<BR>
is no. When
<BR>
NASA broadcasts live scenes from outside the Space Shuttle, you usually
<BR>
see the
<BR>
Earth in vivid blues, browns, greens and dazzling white, but you never
<BR>
see stars at
<BR>
the same time. And if you can see stars, the Earth is tremendously
<BR>
overexposed.
<BR>
The reason for this is contrast. Stars are fairly faint, while the Earth
<BR>
(or the Shuttle, or astronauts floating in space) are very bright.
<BR>
They're sitting in full sunlight! 
<BR>
<P>So the Earth, when lit by the Sun, is many hundreds or thousands of
<BR>
times brighter
<BR>
than the stars behind it. When the astronauts set the camera to take
<BR>
pictures, they
<BR>
need to adjust it for that brightness. To expose the Earth correctly,
<BR>
they need to
<BR>
shut out most of the light hitting the camera, and the faint stars
<BR>
cannot be seen. If they adjust the camera to let in enough light to see
<BR>
stars (or more accurately, use a camera which amplifies the light of the
<BR>
stars), the Earth floods the camera with light, vastly overexposing
<BR>
itself. So even though the sky looks black, there will be no stars in
<BR>
the picture. 
<BR>
<P>I have received a few emails about this part, asking if the human eye
<BR>
would see
<BR>
things differently than a camera. In other words, the human eye is
<BR>
capable of
<BR>
seeing higher contrast than a camera, so is my objection still valid?
<BR>
Yes, it is. Ron Parise is a Shuttle astronaut who happens to work down
<BR>
the hall from me (how cool is my job?), so I asked him if he could see
<BR>
lots of stars out the Shuttle window when the sunlit Earth was below
<BR>
him. He said no; the only stars you can see are the very brightest ones,
<BR>
and only a few of those. As with a camera, the human eye only has a
<BR>
limited range of brightness it can perceive, and the Earth (or Naboo!)
<BR>
is so bright it swamps all the stars. 
<BR>
<P>As a side note, I'll add that some people, remarkably, think that NASA
<BR>
never
<BR>
actually sent men to the Moon; that all the Apollo films were faked. As
<BR>
a piece of
<BR>
key evidence, they cite that all the pictures taken from the Moon have
<BR>
no stars in
<BR>
them! So instead of asking someone who might understand photography,
<BR>
they jump
<BR>
to the conclusion that NASA managed to undertake the largest conspiracy
<BR>
in history.
<BR>
This is Bad reasoning in its absolute highest form.&quot;
