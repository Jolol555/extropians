<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have been thinking of utility of launching some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  personal liberty action campaigns on simple issues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to pave the road to more complex things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Such as organizing a Body Art Rally in Boston
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (where most of the body mod is prohibited,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  except for genital mutilation of male babies).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Or starting public lawsuits based on blue laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so that they have to be repealed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Would anybody comment on this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Do you think it makes sense?
</EM><BR>
<P>It certainly makes sense, as the tactic that has probably done more to extend 
<BR>
human liberty in the Anglo-American world than any other, from the campaigns 
<BR>
of the suffragettes through Ghandi to Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks and MLK 
<BR>
(whose day we celebrate in the US on Monday).  Disciplined civil 
<BR>
disobedience, coupled with skillful, well-organized and financed legal work 
<BR>
is the ultimate tool of liberty in societies premised on the rule of law.  
<BR>
(N.B.: civil disobedience has limited to no effectiveness in societies whose 
<BR>
ruling orders operate outside the bounds of any legal authority.  See Tian An 
<BR>
Men Square and the Soviet Jewish emigration protesters of the late 1970s.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  What have been tried recently?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably the most notable campaigns of this kind since the heyday of the 
<BR>
civil rights movement and anti-war activities of the 1960s have been the 
<BR>
anti-abortion movement, gay rights demonstrations and some isolated 
<BR>
environmentalist campaigns (the WTO mish-mash in Seattle being the most 
<BR>
recent).
<BR>
<P>I would generalize the last 20-30 years in the US as having been a period of 
<BR>
consolidation of changes made as a result of the civil liberties activities 
<BR>
of the 1960s.  In particular, the &quot;mainstreaming&quot; of the race-oriented civil 
<BR>
rights campaigns of the 1950s and early 1960s has probably clouded public 
<BR>
perception of the real utility of the classic model of civil disobedience and 
<BR>
blunted its effectiveness.  Furthermore, the specific federalist legal 
<BR>
strategies employed to good effect by Marshall's &quot;Inc. Fund&quot; &quot;legal SWAT 
<BR>
team&quot; ultimately caused such a broadening of the use of stretched 
<BR>
constitutional tools like the federal Commerce Clause that principled 
<BR>
libertarians have developed deep misgivings about the legal-theoretic 
<BR>
framework that was created in its aftermath.  The almost metaphysical 
<BR>
reasoning employed to rationalize the constitutionality of corrective 
<BR>
legislation in what the Founders would almost certainly have identified as 
<BR>
&quot;private&quot; relationships would make any non-lawyer's eyes cross.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  What are the good targets to start poking that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can lead to liberation in serious areas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because of the constitutional morass of Commerce Clause rationalizations that 
<BR>
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has given rise to in cases involving private 
<BR>
relationships, the best targets are those that involve clear-cut &quot;state 
<BR>
action&quot;, as that term is used in 5th and 14th Amendment jurisprudence.  Thus 
<BR>
the examples I've heard you discuss, Sasha, such as prohibitions on public 
<BR>
dancing or body modifications, are at least somewhat appealing candidates.  
<BR>
Here one runs into the doctrine of the &quot;Police Power&quot;, the nebulous notion of 
<BR>
the core power of the state generally.  As a legal theoretic matter, one has 
<BR>
to identify places where the Police Power runs squarely into a clear-cut 
<BR>
constitutional guarantee of individual liberty, such as the 1st Amendment's 
<BR>
protection of free speech.  
<BR>
<P>So you'll understand the kind of arcane reasoning through which such 
<BR>
campaigns of civil disobedience have to navigate, consider how opponents of 
<BR>
such a campaign will articulate their response.  The state has, under its 
<BR>
inherent Police Power, the right to regulate such matters of &quot;vital public 
<BR>
concern&quot; as public health.  In exercising that right, your adversaries will 
<BR>
say, the state has the right to regulate tattoo artists and body piercing 
<BR>
salons, for instance.  Over against that principle, you will have to argue, 
<BR>
is a constitutionally protected right of free expression.  You will then have 
<BR>
to make a compelling showing that body mods and piercing fall within that 
<BR>
right.  At that point, you will have to show that the state has struck an 
<BR>
improper balance between these two principles.  Prepare for a long, drawn-out 
<BR>
and expensive legal battle, with Attorneys General from many states filing 
<BR>
amicus briefs against you.
<BR>
<P>In &quot;serious areas&quot; that you identify, the right to control one's own body 
<BR>
seems to be the most vital to transhumanists.  Unfortunately, you will look 
<BR>
in vain for a specific articulation of that principle in the US Constitution, 
<BR>
as the many courts who have considered reproductive rights issues have 
<BR>
discovered.  Here, we are in the realm of the mysterious &quot;penumbral&quot; rights 
<BR>
of the 1st, 5th and 14th Amendments, may Jefferson have mercy on us . . .
