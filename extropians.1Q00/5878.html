'What is your name?'  'Michael S. Lorrey.'  'Do you deny having written
<BR>
the following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not until you say:&quot;Some things are considered good and bad subjectively,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but there are some objective, universal thruths, to which all other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things can be compared as a matter of relativity, or as subjective to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those objcetive truths.&quot; This cuts the knot. At this point, anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still thinks all things are subjective looks foolish, because there ARE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universal thruths: gravity, relativity, tanstaafl, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm as big a fan of objectivity as the rest of 'em, but I don't think this
<BR>
argument works.  Certainly, the subjectivist looks like a fool, but we
<BR>
objectivity fans have ALWAYS had the upper hand as far as popularity is
<BR>
concerned.  ;)
<BR>
<P>Your assertion that there are univeral thruths doesn't let you jump out of
<BR>
your own perspective any more than writing down all your beliefs in
<BR>
symbolic logic does.  Any subjectivist could reply to this argument: &quot;but
<BR>
is it only a subjective truth that there are thruths?  If so, mightn't
<BR>
there be thruths for *you* which are radically different from *my*
<BR>
thruths?  Or no thruths for *me* at all?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I don't take there to be a good (read: useful) argument against a
<BR>
self-described subjectivist.  I also don't take there to be a good
<BR>
argument against us.  The subjectivist sees the objectivist as trying to
<BR>
employ a kind of skyhook to lift herself upwards and out of her own
<BR>
perspective to reach the objective context-independent truths; the
<BR>
subjectivist then goes on to report that all the hooks proposed thus far
<BR>
fail to fit that bill.  But rather than coming to terms with this and
<BR>
remaining open-mindedly committed to the truths which he already holds,
<BR>
the subjectivist embraces a NEW skyhook: relativism.
<BR>
<P>But the moral of subjectivism is to maintain your own point of view with
<BR>
an open mind, NOT to reject all points of view.  After all we've learned,
<BR>
you'd think the subjectivist would have managed to avoid falling into this
<BR>
trap.  But many of them haven't... instead going on to make claims which
<BR>
could only be made from no one's perspective, from the God's eye view, the
<BR>
view from nowhere.  &quot;Morality is both subjective AND objective!  Ha ha!  
<BR>
I've thought my way up, out and above this debate!&quot;  If THAT'S what you
<BR>
got out of subjectivism, you've missed the point entirely.
<BR>
<P>In the end, we have to accept that our view is basically right, and work
<BR>
from there.  If you disagree with me about something, don't try to climb
<BR>
your way out of the dilemma.  Converse with me.  That's how we learn and
<BR>
grow.
