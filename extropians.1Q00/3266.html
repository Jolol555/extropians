Stirling Westrup made some enlightened comments about how even the most 
<BR>
cruel and sadistic individuals in the future will be seen as &quot;sick&quot; and not 
<BR>
evil and worthy of severe punishments as in our day.  I do feel that some 
<BR>
people commit heinous crimes at least partially from mental illness and 
<BR>
&quot;psychological demons&quot; while others are essentially healthy and simply 
<BR>
choose the wrong choice.
<BR>
<P>In time they may become very mentally ill but they made the choice in a 
<BR>
healthy state of mind to go down that road.  I think with advanced neuronano 
<BR>
we will be able to look into brains/minds and see what the case is for each 
<BR>
person to give them a fair punishment.
<BR>
<P>Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I am 
<BR>
not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like murder 
<BR>
and rape.  Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together.
<BR>

<P>By the same token, if we resurect Ted Bundy,we'll cure him of whatever 
<BR>
twisted impulse caused him to commit those crimes.Remember, before we can 
<BR>
achieve trancendance, psychology will have to become a hard science. (Your 
<BR>
can't improve what you can't understand.) The consequencesof this seem often 
<BR>
not to be sufficiently appreciated by members of this list.When most folks 
<BR>
hurt others, they are reacting to internal torments of their own. If you can 
<BR>
cure those torments, they'll get better.
