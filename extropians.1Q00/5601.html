Dear friends--
<BR>
<P>Following on with my personal obsession right now, I'd suggest funding for
<BR>
research in the linguistic and neural net bases of biological interactions,
<BR>
from the genome on up through brains and on to ecosystems. Understanding and
<BR>
predicting how biological systems coordinate, communicate, and translate
<BR>
communications into physiology and behavior is going to be the biggest
<BR>
problem facing us in the life sciences in the next century--and it's
<BR>
traditionally been an area of little interest and even considerable bias.
<BR>
Removing the bias (an effort which is underway, and proceeding very slowly)
<BR>
and then funding research and conferences on biological language systems and
<BR>
cooperative interaction would go a long way to pushing the science.
<BR>
<P>And frankly, we're not going to survive on Mars until we can design a
<BR>
low-energy, stable, and robust ecosystem that can support humans for years.
<BR>
We quite simply do not have the theoretical understanding necessary to
<BR>
design such a system, and trial and error attempts (leading possibly to a
<BR>
multi-billion dollar space disaster) could push our planetary exploration
<BR>
program back by decades. Biosphere 2 in its early, idealistic incarnation is
<BR>
a sobering reminder of how naive we still are!
<BR>
<P>Such research, of course, could be fed back immediately into everything from
<BR>
disease control to environmental remediation to designing a world biological
<BR>
community that would comfortably support the twenty billion or so people we
<BR>
might expect by 2050, given longevity and health improvements that would
<BR>
also follow.
<BR>
<P>To make the next long leap, we have to understand much more about who we are
<BR>
and how we function together and in nature, and how nature functions with
<BR>
and without us.
<BR>
<P>Greg Bear
