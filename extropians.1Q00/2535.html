Excerpted from Gurwitsch, Piaget and Recursive Equilibration, by 
<BR>
Joe Dees
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
The phenomenology of perception (wherein all perception is an 
<BR>
intending of its perceptual object), was built upon the foundations 
<BR>
laid by not only Franz Brentano (PSYCHOLOGY FROM AN 
<BR>
EMPIRICAL STANDPOINT, SENSORY AND NOETIC 
<BR>
CONSCIOUSNESS), but by his more famous student Edmund 
<BR>
Husserl (IDEAS PERTAINING TO A PURE PHENOMENOLOGY 
<BR>
AND TO A PHENOMENOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY [BOOK ONE; 
<BR>
GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO A PURE PHENOMENOLOGY, 
<BR>
BOOK TWO, STUDIES IN THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF 
<BR>
CONSTITUTION - (Dees: how we constitute perceptual objects) 
<BR>
and BOOK THREE, PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE 
<BR>
FOUNDATIONS OF THE SCIENCES], LOGICAL 
<BR>
INVESTIGATIONS I and II (Dees: especially II), CARTESIAN 
<BR>
MEDITATIONS, PHENOMENOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY, 
<BR>
EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT, and FORMAL AND 
<BR>
TRANSCENDENT LOGIC), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (THE 
<BR>
STRUCTURE OF BEHAVIOR, THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF 
<BR>
PERCEPTION (Dees: a landmark work), SENSE AND NON-
<BR>
SENSE, SIGNS, and THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE), the 
<BR>
Gestaltists, and Jean Piaget, and reaches its fully elaborated state 
<BR>
in the work of Aron Gurwitsch (THE FIELD OF CONSCIOUSNESS, 
<BR>
MARGINAL CONSCIOUSNESS).  The main contribution which the 
<BR>
Gestaltists (mainly Franz Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler and Max 
<BR>
Wertheimer) made to the phenomenology of perception was their 
<BR>
concept of context-dependence, and Gurwitsch took the gestaltists 
<BR>
to heart on the issue of stimulus-sensation constancy.  Contra the 
<BR>
assertions of the &quot;naive introspectionists&quot;, the light from an apple 
<BR>
cannot be considered atomistically, without reference to its gestalt, 
<BR>
or surrounding environs; there is an interdependence between each 
<BR>
part of a perception and its neighbors, the effect of which is to, 
<BR>
among other things, cause the perceived hue of the selfsame 
<BR>
object to appear differently to the perceiver, depending upon 
<BR>
contiguous hues.  Whereas naive introspectionists asserted that 
<BR>
such perceived differences were learned illusions, Kohler argued 
<BR>
that hues, among other perceptions, are context-dependent (1947: 
<BR>
67-99).  On the basis of his critique, Gurwitsch rejected the 
<BR>
constancy hypothesis (1964: 161-173), and devoted an entire 
<BR>
section of THE FIELD OF CPONSCIOUSNESS to an analysis of 
<BR>
the gestalt concepts of proximity, closure and good continuation, 
<BR>
finding each of them to be an example of context-dependence 
<BR>
(1964: 85-183).  Gurwitsch also saw Henri Bergson's concept of 
<BR>
qualitative multiplicity in this light (1964: 140-144).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence the early Piaget had upon Gurwitsch may be 
<BR>
seen in his acceptance of assimilation and accomodation in the 
<BR>
formation of schemata.  He rejects Piaget's attempt to organize 
<BR>
perception by means of this process, but accepts it as a means by 
<BR>
which functional meanings, or uses, are acquired, maintaining, I 
<BR>
believe correctly, that organization is an autochthonous feature of 
<BR>
experience (1964: 30-36).  Let me try to mediate between the two.  
<BR>
Given that the visual field organizes phenomena, and precisely 
<BR>
phenomena in focus, it is nevertheless necessary to learn to focus 
<BR>
our lenses, to co-ordinate the two lines of sight, to correlate 
<BR>
focusing with binocularity (which are not innately linked, for we can 
<BR>
separate them), and to synthesize vision with our other perceptual 
<BR>
modes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husserl's contributions, of course, are many.  The most 
<BR>
seminal of these, however, did not originate with Husserl himself, 
<BR>
but with his teacher, Franz Brentano.  These include the 
<BR>
characterization of perception as (1) intentional, and (2) pre-
<BR>
reflectively self-aware (1874: 153-189).  These descriptions obtain 
<BR>
whether the object apprehended is psychic, somatic, or in the 
<BR>
physical world.  Reflection is, according to Brentano, the wresting 
<BR>
away of intentionality from its primary object in order to thematize 
<BR>
the act itself.  Husserl, building upon Brentano, asserted that all 
<BR>
worldly phenomena are grasped from a spatiotemporal perspective 
<BR>
(1913: 101-132).  This entails that all worldly perception is 
<BR>
necessarily incomplete, presenting us with visual objects the back 
<BR>
of which we cannot see, sounds whose origin we cannot ascertain, 
<BR>
touch which does not completely enfold and permeate tactile 
<BR>
objects, etc., nor can we grasp their full historicity all at once.  In 
<BR>
fact, we can never grasp any transcendent object in its entirety, 
<BR>
precisely because we cannot behold it from tne infinite number of 
<BR>
possible spatiotemporal perspectives upon it in all modalities of 
<BR>
worldly perception or even in any one of them; it is inexhaustible.  
<BR>
This means that we cannot determine any worldly object 
<BR>
absolutely.  The character of worldly perception as contingently 
<BR>
(rather than absolutely) determining is the basis for its ambiguity 
<BR>
and grounds the possibility of multistable interpretations of its 
<BR>
objects.  However, since objects are context-dependent, the co-
<BR>
presence of context further determines the object, partially resolves 
<BR>
ambiguity, and numerically decreases multistable possibilities.  
<BR>
Context is part of what is known as outer horizon.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object is also more fully grasped by mens of a series of 
<BR>
perceptions which are positionally or modally distinct.  That this is 
<BR>
true indicates that the determinations gained within each act of 
<BR>
perception may be retained in memory and reflectively integrated 
<BR>
with the determinations made by subsequent perceptual acts.  
<BR>
Furthermore, if the perceptions are modally and serially 
<BR>
contiguous, as when I circle around an object while maintaining my 
<BR>
gaze upon it, rather than glancing elsewhere and back again or 
<BR>
substituting touch for vision, the determinations are not discrete or 
<BR>
discontinuous.  Rather, they flow smoothly into one another, each 
<BR>
blending seamlessly with its precursor and successor, and imbue 
<BR>
me with a synthesis; a perception informed by memory, fromwhich 
<BR>
I may imagine, by extrapolation, the determinations to be grasped 
<BR>
from other perspectives not yet assumed.  Although not 
<BR>
necessarily correct, these extrapolated determinations are, in 
<BR>
principle, correctable by assuming the positions in question.  Thus 
<BR>
each perception is bound simultaneously by an inner horizon, 
<BR>
which refers to perspectives upon the object not yet and no longer 
<BR>
assumed, and an outer horizon, which refers to perceptual fields 
<BR>
not yet or no longer assumed, and which may or may not relate to 
<BR>
the object presently perceived, as well as the contextual field which 
<BR>
surrounds the presently perceived object, and from which it 
<BR>
emerges (1913: 91-95, 124-128, 133-135).  We may distinguish 
<BR>
between these two types of horizons by calling the first the world 
<BR>
horizon and members of the second type field horizons.  The world 
<BR>
horizon contains all field horizons, and is reflectively approachable 
<BR>
but not apprehensible in its totality.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husserl's contributions to Gurwitsch's thought are by no means 
<BR>
limited to those discussed here; these are merely the main themes 
<BR>
that gurwitsch uses (1964: 155-305), excepting the 
<BR>
phenomenological reduction, or epoche, which is the bracketing, or 
<BR>
placing in abeyance, of the existential belief in the intention-
<BR>
independent reality of the phenomenal world. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merleau-Ponty's main contribution to Gurwitsch is his close 
<BR>
correlation between world-perception and body-perception.  To 
<BR>
perceive the world is to perceive by means of the body, hence to 
<BR>
perceive the body as well.  Both the existence of the body and its 
<BR>
position relative to the perceived object are implied in the 
<BR>
perception of every extrasomatic object, in its correlation with 
<BR>
proprioception.  Likewise, both the presence of the object and its 
<BR>
position relative to the body are implied in every proprioception, in 
<BR>
its correlation with the extrasomatic object.  In other words, world-
<BR>
perception and body-perception are mutually correlative and 
<BR>
mutually grounding (1945: 203-206).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurwitsch, in THE FIELD OF CONSCIOUSNESS, presents the 
<BR>
thesis that there is a structure common to all perception and 
<BR>
conception - the theme/thematic field/margin structure (1957: 56).  
<BR>
Within a perceptual or conceptual field, there is always a theme, or 
<BR>
focus of intention, surrounded by a thematic field, or context, which 
<BR>
is in turn bounded by a margin, or fringe.  In vision, this structure is 
<BR>
mainly spatial; in audition, it is primarily temporal (although both 
<BR>
aspects of spatiotemporality are present in all perceptions and are 
<BR>
equipresent in our most primordial sense, taction).  If our focus is a 
<BR>
concept, its thematic foeld is composed of other concepts relevant 
<BR>
to it.  Since our acts may themselves be made objects of our 
<BR>
intention, we may, instead of thematizing a particular object within 
<BR>
the somatic or extrasomatic field, thematize the act of somatic or 
<BR>
extrasomatic perception itself, which discloses the tripartate 
<BR>
structure of perceiver-perceiving-perceived.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In MARGINAL CONSCIOUSNESS, Gurwitsch asserts the 
<BR>
omnipresence of three orders of existence in at least marginal 
<BR>
form.  These are &quot;(1) a certain segment of the stream of 
<BR>
consciousness, (2) our embodied existence, and (3) a certain 
<BR>
sector of our perceptual environment&quot; (1985: xlv).  The 
<BR>
omnipresence of these three existential orders is said to 
<BR>
&quot;constitute an a priori necessary condition of consciousness&quot; and 
<BR>
to be the foundation of Husserl's &quot;natural attitude&quot; which, prior to 
<BR>
the phenomenological reduction, assumes an intentionality-
<BR>
independent existing world, for they incessantly provide evidence of 
<BR>
this world to consciousness (1985: 56-59).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, somatic awareness and the perceptual world, or noesis 
<BR>
and noema, mutually imply each other (1985: 59-63), as do figure 
<BR>
and ground for the Gestaltists.  One may begin either with somatic 
<BR>
perception and be led to its referent noematic horizon, or with the 
<BR>
distal perceived world and be drawn to its noetic central nexus.  It 
<BR>
is Hubert dreyfus' contention that the same type of relationship 
<BR>
exists between embodied awareness and self-consciousness 
<BR>
(1992: 235-255).  Alfred Schutz, a long time friend and colleague of 
<BR>
Gurwitsch, insisted upon a fourth omnipresent existential order: 
<BR>
&quot;intersubjectivity, i.e. our knowledge of others is always in the 
<BR>
margin&quot; (1952: letter quoted in 1985: xxxvi-xxxvii).  In other words, 
<BR>
Schutz maintained that our knowledge of ourselves as sociocultural 
<BR>
and language-bearing beings among similar others never entirely 
<BR>
leaves us.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building upon Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, Gurwitsch 
<BR>
designates the body as a &quot;peculiar, specific, and special object&quot;.  
<BR>
There are two reasons for its privileged status.  First, it is the only 
<BR>
object of which we are aware not only through &quot;external&quot; 
<BR>
perception, but also through proprioception.  Second, it is the only 
<BR>
material object which is always perceived, and which forms the 
<BR>
center of reference, and orientation from which we externally 
<BR>
perceive all worldly objects (1985: 59-62).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a world horizon, such that a sector of the world may 
<BR>
be perceived but not the perceptual world at large, so there ar 
<BR>
somatic and psychic horizons.  Thus I may become aware of being 
<BR>
embodied as the &quot;confused horizon&quot; to which any particular 
<BR>
kinesthetic or &quot;vital&quot; feeling (vigor, langour, etc.) refers (1985: 34-
<BR>
37), and of my ego as the horizon enclosing a section of my 
<BR>
stream of consciousness.  In either case, the horizon may be 
<BR>
reflectively approximated, but never completely grasped (1985: 20-
<BR>
23).  We may also lose our bearings in all three horizons.  For 
<BR>
instance, I may begin walking due north in a strange town on a 
<BR>
cloudy day and, after several curves and turns, suddenly realize 
<BR>
that I know neither where I am nor in which direction I am going.  
<BR>
Liklewise, when I first stood on one foot with my eyes closed and 
<BR>
attempted to hold my other foot sideways at a forty-five degree 
<BR>
angle to the floor, I was surprised by how far I was off.  Finally, I 
<BR>
may be working through a problem and completely lose my train of 
<BR>
thought.  Practice will improve my ability to maintain my bearings, 
<BR>
but perfection is not achievable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard M. Zaner, a student of Gurwitch's, advanced his 
<BR>
teacher's work in at least two ways (in THE CONTEXT OF SELF).  
<BR>
First, he further develops Gurwitsch's description of the 
<BR>
theme/field/margin macrostructure of perception/conception by 
<BR>
means of a desceiption of the fine-grained system of intrinsic 
<BR>
simple, complex, double and multiple self-and cross-reference by 
<BR>
means of which constituents configure into a gestalt theme.  There 
<BR>
are, in addition, such referencings present between constituents of 
<BR>
the theme and constituents of its thematic field, but these 
<BR>
theme/field relations do not demonstrate the degree of relevancy 
<BR>
present in intra-thematic relations.  A change in focus, however, 
<BR>
may change the character of the theme by promoting field 
<BR>
constituents to the status of theme constituents, by demoting 
<BR>
theme constituents to field status, or both, as well as by similar 
<BR>
promotions and demotions between field 
<BR>
and margin (1981: 67-91).  Second, Zaner expands the concept of 
<BR>
contexture, stating that not only is extrasomatic perception 
<BR>
organized into a gestalt contexture, but also that somatic 
<BR>
perception/action comprises a second contexture, and mental life 
<BR>
comprises a third.  He goes on to assert that these three 
<BR>
distinguishable yet inseparable contextures are related, through the 
<BR>
same type of intrinsic referencing system found in eachn of them, 
<BR>
into a larger system which he equates with the self and terms the 
<BR>
complexure of life (1981: 92-109).  My addition to this is that the 
<BR>
complex referencing 
<BR>
structure of contexture is, on the level of definition rather than 
<BR>
positionality, also the structure of sign/sign relations in sign 
<BR>
systems, and that the relations between these symbolic 
<BR>
contexture maps and the territories of the perception/action 
<BR>
contextures are sign/signified relations.  Self-onsciousness 
<BR>
learns/constructs, utilizes and traverses these systems.
