<BR>
<EM>&gt;As I see it, transhumanism is not per se technology dependent. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strives to improve the human condition through rational means, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that is independent on which means are available. But transhumanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also has a kind of a &quot;subtext&quot; or stronger sense that says the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;condition can be so radically changed through these means that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes sense of talking about a transhuman or posthuman condition. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is much stronger than the first meaning, and also likely technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dependent - there doesn't seem to be any likely non-technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;means to achieve this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see it that way too. In addition, humans and their technology will continue to
<BR>
evolve, no matter what. While technophobes and technophiles philosophize,
<BR>
technology continues to accelerate. That much is clear.
<BR>
What is not so clear is whether humanity will manage to move past superstition
<BR>
and tyranny. That seems a more important question to me, because failure to get
<BR>
past superstition and tyranny has dire (mortal) consequences that failure to
<BR>
develop a particular technology does not have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So what happens if technology X is impossible? Suppose X is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics. Then a possible way of reaching the other posthuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibilities before dying is closed, but people who are lucky or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;young enough to take advantage of new possibilities will become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;posthuman anyway. If X is nanotechnology a lot of exciting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibilities cannot be reached, but there are still ways of reaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a posthuman condition, even if it doesn't include utility fogs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter compilers. If X is life extension, then things are bleak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individually, but it is still no absolute limit of becoming (mortal)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;posthumans.  Going through our favorite technologies it seems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is no single technology we *need*, there are a lot of useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologies we would like to see developed but there are enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibilities so that the failure of several technologies will still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not mean the end of the posthuman dream.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about a technology to end superstition and tyranny?
<BR>
I suggest we might call that technology &quot;psychonomy&quot; -- how do you like that
<BR>
name?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What if all the transhumanifying technologies are impossible? While it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might be that they are all physically impossible, there is a risk that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(say) social developments makes them infeasible. Not terribly likely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but worth considering. Assume it is impossible to reach a posthuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;level and the strong interpretation of transhumanism does not hold. Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanism then pointless?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not if transhumanism includes technologies which have already proven useful
<BR>
(or necessary) to transcendence. IOW, if we can transcend through other
<BR>
technologies than the ones you've mentioned, transhumanism remains viable,
<BR>
feasible, and workable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would say this is not true. Even if I cannot expect to become an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immortal transcendent superintelligence able to develop in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inconceivable directions, I can improve my human condition through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rational means. It is not as flashy, but I will still benefit. Dynamic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;optimism is good even if you live in the stone age. A rational,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology-friendly humanism can do a lot of good, and help overcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the superstition and tyrrany. Also, if the limits to development are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not set by inflexible physical laws or insurmountable resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constraints but by social limitations, a transhumanism of the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind can help overcome these limitations and bring about opening up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;further changes.
</EM><BR>
<P>In further support of your comments, if transhumanism correlates to
<BR>
enlightenment of the hyper-cognitive kind, then transhumanism may even transcend
<BR>
technology. As technology is to Homo sapiens, so transcendence may be to
<BR>
transhumans.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To sum up, I don't think transhumanism is dependent on technology, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limits on technology will also put limits on transhumanism. Totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without technology it just becomes a kind of humanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seldom does such incisive and coherent analyses as yours arrive in cyberspace.
<BR>
<P>Grok it and rocket,
