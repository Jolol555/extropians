<P><EM>&gt; The question is of dubious relevance anyway; the militia movement is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and never was monolithic.  It may well include racists; it also includes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Blacks (like the spokesman for a prominent Ohio group) and Jews (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  most of the San Diego group, or so it was said some years ago).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

Comming from Ohio, I know who you mean (the fellow who testified before the 
<BR>
House of Representatives)and I believe left the org because of Klan 
<BR>
infiltration, among other reasons.  Did ya know that after Butler goes to 
<BR>
that big Klan Rally in the sky, Aryan Nations is considering a move here?
<BR>
<P>Do you accept the data gathered by the Southern Poverty Law Center? Too 
<BR>
Leftist for ya? Academics? Defamation League? Funny thing is, I am frequently 
<BR>
doubtful about what the government does simply because its dominated by 
<BR>
self-serving lawyers-everyone has hit Law school, if not passed their bar 
<BR>
exam.  So when a prosecuter says something, I scrutinize it for possible 
<BR>
motivations (career-wise benefit) as well as defense lawyers who again, 
<BR>
formulate &quot;reality&quot;
<BR>
to suit their wallets, &quot;ain't that right OJ?&quot;  
<BR>
<P>After looking into some of the militia's personally, and finding their booths 
<BR>
loaded with literature of a truely doubtful patriotism; one can surmise 
<BR>
pretty much who they are.  Let me make it clearer, the pamphlets and such 
<BR>
were klan material intermixed with anti-tax and anti-government crapolla.  
<BR>
What am I supposed to decide, coupled with reports that appear to butress my 
<BR>
own personal experiences?  Actually, I am not interested in feeling safer by 
<BR>
taking away your firearms.  I just want to have mine when the mouth breathers 
<BR>
and droolers come over the hill.  
<BR>
<P>Yours, in Paranoia
