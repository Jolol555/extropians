<P>
I just finished reading S. Baxter's new book, 'Manifold Time'.  Although I 
<BR>
enjoyed reading it, the last 5-10 pages of this 400+ page book was very 
<BR>
disturbing.  And scary. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In a nutshell, the discussion is that our universe, being metastable, i.e.,  
<BR>
not in its lowest energy state, is like living in the 'wrong neighborhood'.   
<BR>
&nbsp;The proclaimed goal, at least announced by some of our descendents a billion 
<BR>
years hence, is to time-travel back to present day, and induce a quantun 
<BR>
tunneling effect that brings back the universe to its 'true, vacuum state'.  
<BR>
This has the unfortunate 'side effect' of instantly destroying all of 
<BR>
humankind, in fact all life forms, all matter in our 'false universe'.  
<BR>
<P>The lofty and 'moral' goal is our descendents as 'the end of time, is that 
<BR>
since we are currently residing in a 'false vacuum' state, and the universe, 
<BR>
in order for it to be the 'mother' of untold other future universes, with 
<BR>
untold fecundity (life), (black holes are a big keyword in this book) our 
<BR>
descendents deliberately induce a true vacuum which spreads at the speed of 
<BR>
light, and eventually will destroy the universe.  
<BR>
<P>The first question:  Does anyone who has studied this theory of 'false 
<BR>
vacuum's' feel that 'breaking the universe' is indeed possible?  If not now, 
<BR>
in the near future???  Secondly, the 'noble goals' that the author impresses 
<BR>
upon the reader, are, IMHO,rather irritating, and  anathema to me.  Why would 
<BR>
you, or anyone, want to destroy our life, so that we can be the 'proud' 
<BR>
progenitor of future lifeforms in trillions of other universes, trillions of 
<BR>
years hence?  Its not our fault we were born in the 'wrong neighborhood'!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Any takers on this.  
<BR>
<P>Thanks, 
<BR>
<P>Ed
