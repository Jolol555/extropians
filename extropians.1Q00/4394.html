<EM>&gt; &gt; Come to think of it, I don't want you to have a near-anything box.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Who's to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say you won't make assasination nano-bots to resolve a personal dispute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between us?  Or perhaps you join a doomsday cult and your &quot;god&quot; commands 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to set nerve gas loose in my neighborhood.  To be honest, I don't (yet)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trust my fellow man enough to give him almost unlimited power to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever his heart desires in the privacy of his own home.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You are talking about an &quot;everything&quot; box, not an &quot;almost anything&quot; box!
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how an &quot;almost anything&quot; box is much safer than an &quot;everything&quot; 
<BR>
box if with it you can really make almost *anything.*  Unless by &quot;almost 
<BR>
anything&quot; you exclude all manner of things such as gases, germs, viruses, 
<BR>
bacteria, programmable replicators, robots, super-computers, radioactive 
<BR>
matter, etc., etc.  Sounds like your &quot;almost anything&quot; box would actually be 
<BR>
limited to almost nothing, save maybe a McDonald's Happy Meal or two.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You should sit back and think about what you are saying though...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Presumably if you are smart enough to design and manufacture assassin-bots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you could find dozens of ways to harm someone that do not require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resorting to nanotech!  Opening the bleeder valves of the brake lines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the car driven by the targeted individual seems so much easier;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as would lacing the milk in their refrigerator with doxorubicin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;afalatoxin or even Safrole, those might take longer.  Be sure to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;steal something when you are leaving, so they don't know you came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by to poison them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure I could do it like that, but for the fact that it would be near 
<BR>
impossible to implement any of those methods without leaving some evidence 
<BR>
identifying myself as the perpetrator, or at least risk being seen by some 
<BR>
nosy neighbor or nano-sized surveillance camera.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its highly questionable whether nanotech could ever provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-traceable methods of harm.  If you have audit trails on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the &quot;almost anything&quot; machines
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean if you have *non-hackable* audit trails.  That's a big if.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and/or extensive nano-enviro-monitors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(nano-Transparent-Society), it is questionable whether anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could get to you to do concrete damage.  Since the good guys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outnumber the bad guys (we hope), presumably there would be quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;active public and private development of nanodefenses, just like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we now have locks on our doors and cameras in our banks.  Things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't change, they just get smaller.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are mistakenly carrying the paradigm of the good old days into 
<BR>
the great unknown nano-frontier.  I don't think the number of good guys 
<BR>
versus bad guys will make a hill of beans worth of difference.  There are 
<BR>
probably many times more law enforcement officers than there are hackers.  
<BR>
That didn't stop Melissa virus or the recent DoS attacks, and it probably 
<BR>
won't stop sufficiently equipped and motivated nano-crooks.  Sure, in the 
<BR>
end the mounties may always get their man, but that won't mean jack to you 
<BR>
and me once our neighborhood has gone gray goo.
<BR>
<P>Seeing as how the tech will most likely be managed by AI, anybody who can 
<BR>
copy, steal, evolve or purchase on the black market the necessary 
<BR>
hard/software to control their own AI will probably be able to hack all but 
<BR>
the newest and most advanced security measures.  Get your hands on an AI 
<BR>
capable of self-optimization and self-evolution and within days you may well 
<BR>
be able to hack every imaginable security device.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The species as designed cannot be made guaranteeably more trustworthy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Doing that requires re-engineering the mind.  Which is why, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long run, IMO, higher-intelligence AIs might seek to do away with humans.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  I think we're more trustworthy than we were back in the age 
<BR>
of empires.  Heck I think we're more trustworthy than we were before WWII, 
<BR>
or even before the U.S. Civil Rights movement, or since the end of South 
<BR>
African apartheid or even the fall of the USSR.  Maybe not by much, buy 
<BR>
little by little we are evolving into a better species.  This trend will 
<BR>
certainly continue.  Sure there will probably always be the odd crackpot who 
<BR>
is largely untrustworthy.  But, if we can safely get past the demise of 
<BR>
religious fundamentalism (and *that* is probably the biggest if of all), I 
<BR>
think there will be fewer and fewer reasons for any one wacko to be wacky 
<BR>
enough to unleash destruction on the rest of us.
<BR>
