<P><EM>&gt; Thats it!  If you compare the results of extropians with the

<EM>&gt; general population, we were way more T than F, the opposite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the majority.  Could it be as simple as that?  T vs F?  spike

<P>I think so -- especially when you combine the introverted and
<BR>
intuitive features.  Sociality is the creature of extroverted feeling
<BR>
types; when you consider the relatively archaic and unsocialized
<BR>
character of extroverted feeling in dominantly introverted thinking
<BR>
types [these traits relate as bipolarities on Jung's &quot;Function Com-
<BR>
pass&quot;) that refine rational cognition at the expense of feeling, the
<BR>
picture comes into focus pretty well.
<BR>
<P>A typical social situation will demand behavior expressive of this
<BR>
inferior function, so that if you were to observe yourself most
<BR>
carefully at these times, Spike, you would probably discover
<BR>
some responses that are gauche, not entirely what is expected
<BR>
from most others. A negative feedback loop develops, and....
<BR>
<P>An extroverted feeling-type friend could probably tell you what
<BR>
behavior could be helpfully modified.
