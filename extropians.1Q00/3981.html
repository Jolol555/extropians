Please define &quot;adaptive mutations&quot;.  Its well known
<BR>
(now) that everything from bacteria to human cells
<BR>
have methods for controlling self-mutation.  In
<BR>
bacteria its called error-prone repair and in cancer
<BR>
cells its called a mutator phenotype (brought on
<BR>
by damage to the mechanisms that prevent cell division
<BR>
in the presence of mutations).  These mechanisms provide
<BR>
survival advantages in stressful environments, so it
<BR>
is natural that nature would evolve them.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you simply mutate enough copies of your genome,
<BR>
sooner or later you *will* come up with an &quot;adaptive&quot;
<BR>
mutation.  This doesn't require cellular &quot;consciousness&quot;
<BR>
or quantum evolution.  It simply requires the basic
<BR>
application of the mechanisms we already to know to
<BR>
be the case.  Now, if you had hard evidence that
<BR>
adaptive mutations were occuring *regularly* at
<BR>
*highly* improbable frequencies, then you might have
<BR>
a case for an interesting phenomena.  However, to
<BR>
get those numbers you have to keep track of how
<BR>
many genomes nature threw away to get the adaptive
<BR>
variant.  And those numbers are very difficult to
<BR>
come by in most situations.
