<P>
<EM>&gt;Stirling Westrup made some enlightened comments about how even the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cruel and sadistic individuals in the future will be seen as &quot;sick&quot; and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evil and worthy of severe punishments as in our day.
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you know the comments are &quot;enlightened&quot; if you are clearly unaware of
<BR>
the thought processes that went into the proposal?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I do feel that some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people commit heinous crimes at least partially from mental illness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;psychological demons&quot; while others are essentially healthy and simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choose the wrong choice.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's simpler that that - clouding the situation with dodgy contemporary
<BR>
ideals such as the labelling of socially incompatible individuals as &quot;ill&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;diseased&quot; will not help. As Descartes said &quot;I am what I am&quot;. He knew
<BR>
that he was Descartes, had the faculties and &quot;choices&quot; of Descartes and
<BR>
nobody or thing else. Same with you. You do what you do and ONLY what you
<BR>
do. Righteousness is irrelevant. A pointless crusade followed by fools who
<BR>
need to be told what to think and propagate this &quot;wisdom&quot; to others for
<BR>
socio-sensory gratification (seeming wise attracts mates!). Someone rapes my
<BR>
wife, I'll want to kill them - not due to a cosmically significant &quot;floaty&quot;
<BR>
righteousness, just because that was my reaction. I did not decide to have
<BR>
this reaction - I discovered that I had this reaction to such situations. I
<BR>
can decide to attempt to block this urge, but then where did the urge to
<BR>
decide to block the first urge come from? Within parts of &quot;me&quot; over which
<BR>
the consciousness that &quot;I&quot; consider my &quot;self&quot; has no control. The &quot;decision&quot;
<BR>
to block this particular urge may have come from somebody or something else,
<BR>
but still the attachment of &quot;authority&quot; to such external agents had it's
<BR>
origins in our incorruptible, predetermined base motivations.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I
</EM><BR>
am
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like
</EM><BR>
murder
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and rape.  Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on what you are trying to achieve. Again I see the magic word
<BR>
&quot;should&quot; - the mark of a follower. What &quot;should&quot; I do?
<BR>
Well I say who &quot;should&quot; define the &quot;shoulds&quot;? Well, here in this text it's
<BR>
me, and I say you &quot;should&quot; think for yourself. On all issues. Not just those
<BR>
that haven't been flagged as untouchable by some self-appointed &quot;authority&quot;.
<BR>
So, are you trying to cause pain in the offender's consciousness as vengence
<BR>
(with the highly suss assumption that the consciousness is the central
<BR>
control structure of the mind) or train the offender's intelligence against
<BR>
the action you object to?
<BR>
I would argue that training the mind is fair enough, but not with the side
<BR>
effect of torture. In future, with perhaps alternative methods of mind
<BR>
control, we can beat these errant units into shape using non-painful
<BR>
methods.
<BR>
My personal conclusion on this subject is the modify or banish idea. A
<BR>
leader of a social order could put a question to an offending member - Be
<BR>
modified or leave this society. If the individual had a problem with
<BR>
modification, he can go - if not, then a simple painless modification would
<BR>
surely be the best solution to the problem in hand.
<BR>
What do you think about this?
<BR>
