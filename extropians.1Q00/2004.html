<P>
<EM>&gt;He opined that popular predictions of the apocalypse, the Rapture, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;End of the World, tend to peter out after 2000. In fact, there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religious -- presumably he meant Christian -- predictions of the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world with deadlines after 2012.
</EM><BR>
<P>The obvious response to this is a reminder that religions have always
<BR>
had apocalyptic expectations and mythology---long before, of course, we
<BR>
approached the year 2000 on a standard calendar.  They faded, were
<BR>
revised, or whatever but the apocalyptic inclination persisted.  With
<BR>
Christianity particularly intense periods of apocalyptic fervor have
<BR>
appeared and disappeared; these sometimes centered on dates (for
<BR>
example, the years 666 and 1000) which, of course, passed without
<BR>
incident.
<BR>
<P>Magic dates don't always have to be the focus, though.  Consider the
<BR>
Millerites, a vocal Christian sect which was absolutely sure for some
<BR>
reason that the Rapture would occur on a particular date in 1843, then,
<BR>
when nothing happened, in 1844.  After a while some people stopped
<BR>
listening and the Millerites, fragmenting, learned to not be so
<BR>
specific. . . .
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But the point that interests me is that if the Christians stop jumping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up and down shrieking &quot;the sky is falling!&quot; because they're run out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;messianic deadlines, politics and cultural life will take an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interesting turn.
</EM><BR>
<P>Doubtful.  If they move away from immediate millenarianism it won't be
<BR>
because they've given up on the basic idea.  Same for the possibility
<BR>
that they accept certain technologies---some religious people have
<BR>
accepted new technologies in the past because they become ubiquitous and
<BR>
part of the culture's fabric.  Many devout Christians today accept
<BR>
bicycles, movies, and various basic facts about medicine and astronomy
<BR>
even though these things were once considered abhorrences or heresies by
<BR>
some.  Certain technologies, however, such as the ones we are expecting,
<BR>
challenge religious assumptions more substantially than your average
<BR>
Twentieth-century appliances.
<BR>
<P><P>The (S/s)ingularity, of course, is a notion which has many of the
<BR>
qualities of a classic apocalyptic program.  All the religious believers
<BR>
assure us that their apocalypse is the true one and that yes, this time
<BR>
it really will happen.  Those of us expecting a singularity or something
<BR>
like one say the same thing.  But we probably really are right.  At the
<BR>
very least we have a chance of being right.
