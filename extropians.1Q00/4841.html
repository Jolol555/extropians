<EM>&gt; [...] I think there is a problem with a country that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contains more guns than legal gun-owners. 
</EM><BR>
<P>And that problem is ...?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Especially when that country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compounds that problem by a complete failure to make these dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instrumentalities as safe as they can practically be,
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume you're referring to the rumored &quot;smart guns&quot; that won't fire
<BR>
unless the hand is wearing a magic ring, or some such.  One more thing
<BR>
to go wrong in an emergency -- when the battery runs down, or you took
<BR>
the ring off to go to bed.  Or the burglar cuts off your finger to get
<BR>
the ring.  Or the cops develop a gadget that disables the ring remotely,
<BR>
and gangs steal one or reverse-engineer it.
<BR>
<P>Guns are safer than a lot of things.  If people want safer guns, they'll
<BR>
pay for safer guns.  My guns are safe enough for me, thank you.  (I
<BR>
particularly like the &quot;decocker&quot; model.)  But as long as one child is
<BR>
accidentally shot every now and then, politicians will have an excuse to
<BR>
disarm anyone who can't afford the luxury model.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; and the fact that gun owners unnecessarily enjoy more anonymity than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; car owners. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that is wrong.  It chafes me that if I owned a car I wouldn't be
<BR>
able to park it without registering my name and address with the city.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Japan does not allow every wacko in the country to own a gun. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you suggesting that Japan is populated mainly by wackos?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does that make the Japanese government a fascist regime?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it doesn't *make* the Japanese government fascist.
<BR>
<P>In Japan, I hear, the police inspect your apartment whenever they like,
<BR>
just in case you have any guns.  Never mind whether that's just or
<BR>
unjust: How many dead cops would it be worth to adopt such a policy in
<BR>
America?
