<EM>&gt; I sincerely wish the U.S., was doing what you say, but unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the U.S. is still a very imperialist and interventionist country.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However please note, That this is because of the way the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international issues and I'm sure more Americans oppose to imperialism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of it's current foreign policies, than those who advocate them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think it's merely the government to blame here.  For example, the
<BR>
views I've expoused -- i.e., about the US basically acting like any garden
<BR>
variety imperial power (and not the worst of the bunch; I don't want to just
<BR>
make a shrill case here) -- all depend on research any US citizen or
<BR>
resident can do.  I do not have some special gnosis, nor am I privvy to some
<BR>
secret proceedings of the State Department, on these issues.
<BR>
<P>So, partly to blame are American complacency.  Granted, government and the
<BR>
some of the Media do distort things, but one does not have to spend day and
<BR>
night in used books stores and research libraries to find this stuff out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But unfortunately when you live in America, you don't get all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the things that happen in our regions of the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree on that.  Americans, I've noticed, tend on the whole not to care
<BR>
much.  Too many of them view foreign nations as either vacation spots or war
<BR>
zones.  Now, that said, I'm not advocating that everyone in the US suddenly
<BR>
become a scholar of world affairs and culture.  Far from it, because I fear
<BR>
that more public interest might make America even more interventionist.
<BR>
After all, if Americans remained unaware of Somalia in the early 1990s,
<BR>
maybe just maybe the problem would have contained itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Speaking of my country (Mexico)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although after the end of the usa/Mexico war when we lost more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; territory the usa has never invaded or threatened us militarily,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they've forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us to do what they think it's better using all sorts of resources or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excuses.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand this, but one minor point I would add too.  I don't want to
<BR>
whitewash the American role in that war, but, at the time, both nations did
<BR>
a lot of bad things.  It was probably inevitable that eventually they would
<BR>
clash.  A lot of Europeans, at the time, actually believe the US would lose
<BR>
and Mexico because the latter had the bigger army.
<BR>
<P>That said, we must admit Mexico has a prett corrupt government now and that
<BR>
needs to be cleaned up.  This is starting to change -- perhaps not quickly
<BR>
enough -- but I doubt Mexico will be more assertive vis-a-vis the US until
<BR>
it does.  After all, PRI does rely on a lot of US support, official and
<BR>
unofficial, whereas opposition parties do not.  At least, this is my
<BR>
North-of-the-border understanding.:/
<BR>
<P>I would also like to see Mexico become more free market oriented.  That is,
<BR>
for the government to get out of the way NOT of American big business but of
<BR>
individual Mexicans.  A step along this path would include denationalizing
<BR>
government owned industries, downsizing the government, and legalizing all
<BR>
victimless crimes (such as marijuana production, distribution, and use).  Of
<BR>
course, the US would never go for that, so it's just my pipe dream.  (No pun
<BR>
intended!:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
