<P>
<EM>&gt; That attack on logical positivism has always bothered me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I usually see this attack directed at some form of matieralism (&quot;Matieralism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't explain emotions.&quot;) The answer for that is &quot;Yes it can, emotions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns of neuron firings in the brain.&quot; (c.f. Dennett, Hofstadter).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could a similar defense work for logical positivism? Given empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge of how human (or any other kind of) mind(s) work, don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophical systems and ideas become just as matieralistic and examinable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as computer programs?
</EM><BR>
<P>As a guy with sympathies for the logical positivists (as, I think, we'd
<BR>
all do well to have at some point or other), I have to say that the attack
<BR>
bothered me a bit as well when I first heard it.  However, I find the
<BR>
attack on logical positivism *as stated* to be irrefutable.  ... and yet
<BR>
one can't help but wonder if some more refined version of logical
<BR>
positivism can do the job better.
<BR>
<P>However, your move sounds to me more like the sociobiologist's move to
<BR>
make ethics a science than logical positivism per se.  The problem with it
<BR>
is this:  Suppose I waved a magic wand and, all of a sudden, we knew
<BR>
everything about all of our future behaviors.  (I want to stress that this
<BR>
wand is magical, and we will never have a wand like this.)  We now try to
<BR>
ask, &quot;given that So-and-so did such-and-such on such-and-such a day with
<BR>
such-and-such intentions, heck, even given that her action has
<BR>
such-and-such Total Consequences (tm) [now this is REALLY a magic wand!],
<BR>
was this action right or wrong?&quot;
<BR>
<P>It's not at all obvious what answer you'd give, if any, since no empirical
<BR>
facts by themselves can establish that an action is right.  You could make
<BR>
a claim WITHIN ethical theory that &quot;an action is right iff the following
<BR>
facts obtain ...&quot; but that claim itself would not be verifiable.
<BR>
<P>Note that I'm WITH Dennett et al in arguing that, for example, spooky
<BR>
mental qualia don't exist, but I DON'T think that I can prove this
<BR>
scientifically; I'd be at a loss as to how to even begin to do something
<BR>
so.  The best science can give us is: &quot;No verifiable evidence for them SO
<BR>
far!&quot; which is a sufficient knockdown for many theories but not for
<BR>
theories which attempt to tell some story about how they're true but
<BR>
necessarily unverifiable.  So called &quot;mental realists&quot; like Searle and
<BR>
Nagel do that with arguments about qualia, and most ethical theories can
<BR>
run a similar trick.  &quot;Of course it hasn't been verified.  I TOLD you it
<BR>
wasn't verifiable.  It's still right, however.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Aside: &quot;source-code&quot;, or &quot;domdule&quot; level understanding of the structure of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human mind could tell us, once and for all, in real physical terms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly what humans mean by &quot;mean&quot; (assuming most humans use isomorphic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mental machinery for these sorts of cognitive operations, which seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable). Epistimelogy would become empirically descriptive, and we'ed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have some sort of physical base on which to build a philosophy .
</EM><BR>
<P>Would we?  &quot;But how do you know that your source-code understanding is the
<BR>
RIGHT one?&quot; any skeptical epistemologist might point out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is the sort of stuff I was hoping to see when I started studying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychology. Boy was I in for a disappointment :)
</EM><BR>
<P>May I direct you towards our fantastic cognitive science department?  They
<BR>
may have a lot more of what you're looking for there.  ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; P.S. I think Eliezer said it best when he observed that when one attempts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bottom out human formal systems like physics or math or philosophy, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finds human semantic primitives, not universal ontological primitives.
</EM><BR>
<P>How could you tell the difference?
