<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm as forward thinking as the next guy (well maybe not on this list), but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally I'll stick to the old-fashioned food for as long as possible.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know the general consensus is that GM food is OK.  But the same thing was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought about such things as cigarette smoking, silicone breasts and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thalydomide (sp?) once upon a time.  Sure maybe GM stuff is harmless, but my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal is long life.  I ain't taking any chances ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Odd that you chose that set of comparisons: (1) No one with 2 brain cells
<BR>
to rub together ever thought smoking was safe, even in 19th century,
<BR>
until tobacco company advertising in the 50s. (2) Silicone breast implants
<BR>
_are_ completely safe, and all the propoganda and court cases you've heard
<BR>
about are piffle.  (3) Thalidomide was a big goof--no argument there.
<BR>
Fortunately, our FDA had enough delay-causing bureaucrats to keep it off
<BR>
the market long enough for us to discover its dangers (of course someone
<BR>
else discovered that, and the FDA would have approved it without the test
<BR>
that discovered it, so they don't really deserve any of the credit they
<BR>
claim for keeping us safe from Thalidomide, but that's a different story).
<BR>
<P>In short, I think the question is not how well-tested or how new a
<BR>
technology is, but how truly _different_ is it from well-known stuff,
<BR>
how confident can we be in our assessments given the facts, and how
<BR>
honest and reliable are the people giving us those facts?  If one is
<BR>
reasonably well-educated and understands whats going on with GM foods,
<BR>
if one ignores anything said by the government, industry advertising,
<BR>
and political scare groups, and looks at just the facts, they are
<BR>
pretty clear to me: moving proteins around shouldn't hurt anyone.
<BR>
Sure, if I had some severe allergy to peanuts or something I'd want
<BR>
to know if any peanut proteins were used in this tomato I'm buying,
<BR>
but besides that, GM foods just aren't different enough to make me
<BR>
worry despite their being new and untested.
