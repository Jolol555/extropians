<EM>&gt; Seriously, what territories have you acquired lately that were worth the

<EM>&gt; version of &quot;The Gallic Wars&quot;, cross the Rubicon and trip on a narcissistic

<EM>&gt; high at each &quot;Hail Spudboy&quot;.What's coming are the Huns, the Vandals, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Goths and the Visigoths, and worst of all, the knife twisted by your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bestfriend. Is this not an adequate metaphor for &quot;The Wages of Imperialism&quot;?

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert, imperialism in the classic sense may be gone, but that is because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's too expensive and make's for poor public relations!  We now live in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age of neo-colonialism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I quite agree, although; as I recall, Zero Powers does not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our global corporate CEO's are the new conquering Ceasers who write their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of the 'Gallic Wars' as business self-help manuals!  And they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too hailed as great defenders of their respective way of life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have unhesitating agreed five years ago. Not, I not so sure that
<BR>
the heroes of corporate imperialism are popular due to the exportation of
<BR>
jobs and the importation of low-quality merchandise.  But most importantly,
<BR>
because the public profoundly fears &quot;internationalism&quot; in any form. I know
<BR>
Michael Lorrey believes that because I see some value in internationalism
<BR>
(e.g. the expansion of international law, improved balance of trade arrange-
<BR>
ment through international offices, etc.) that I am ready to sell-out our
<BR>
country's ideals motivated by some sinister will-to-power or commercial
<BR>
gain by progressive seduction of populations.
<BR>
<P>Michael would, I think, prefer to allow our military to secure the benefits
<BR>
of corporate capitalism for leaders and shareholders.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And the 'barbarian hordes' of our day would be India and China who want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desperately the technological and economic type of power we possess.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't overlook ideological fanaticism. And beyond this, the unstable balance
<BR>
of power in the Near East and Asia inclines me to consider Iran and North
<BR>
Korea as the greatest threats to our global position.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Where does the knife-twisting come from in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age?  Our own government, ourselves?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I have, perhaps discourteously, represented Michael's opinion
<BR>
[with whom I disagree but whose right to which I am willing, as one is,
<BR>
to defend to the human limit, as my military record will attest -- no
<BR>
hyperbole  here] it would be interesting to read his response to your
<BR>
question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I hope in time we can get beyond this thinking and nationalistic concern in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all camps concerned.  What will the 'wages of neo-colonialism' ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am doing a White Paper on this subject even as we speak; while I cannot
<BR>
reproduce my response in this document, perhaps we could discuss this
<BR>
later.  Your question is, in my view, of the highest importance.
