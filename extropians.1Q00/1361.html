<P>
Caveat: The below is not me defending, or attempting to convince. It is
<BR>
me describing; in part so that E. Shaun can decide whether to trust
<BR>
anything I say, and in part to find out what I happen to hold true in
<BR>
this chunk of time on a Sunday afternoon. Apologia: I use the word
<BR>
&quot;pinheaded&quot; to refer to a specific certainty, not to anyone who holds
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Eliezer had some great things to say a while back:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;
<BR>
I don't trust my mind, but I can't think with anything else.
<BR>
The validity of reason, the validity of choice, or the validity of
<BR>
knowledge cannot be proven; but there is no better way available.
<BR>
--Eliezer S. Yudkowsky
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Amen to that.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P>Yes. the human brain is wired for comfortable certainty. Credulity comes
<BR>
in more than one flavor, it seems.
<BR>
<P>I choose to be selective about giving in to the wiring on some matters,
<BR>
since the wiring is just wiring. 
<BR>
And some of it is just plain orneriness on my part, Shaun. Weak and
<BR>
compromising? If you say so (laugh).
<BR>
I just figure I don't have enough data to think further than the data. 
<BR>
<P>Given someone's particular explication of (a) (G/g)od, I may be able to
<BR>
reject it outright. 
<BR>
<P>For a lot of them, though &quot;I can't imagine an entity that meets these
<BR>
specs&quot; is as close as I can get, and sometimes that certainty is absent
<BR>
for me. A suitably subtle (G/g)od might well have escaped my attention.
<BR>
<P>Personally, specifically, on the NONexistence of the overall category
<BR>
&quot;((G/g)od(s))&quot;: Zetetically, I find I can say
<BR>
<P>a) I haven't seen a clearly identifiable one, or convincing evidence of
<BR>
same, of the J-C stripe lately.
<BR>
b) I don't find a whole lot of putative evidence and argumentation
<BR>
regarding any stripe overwhelmingly convincing.
<BR>
c) 1) I've lived a very fortunate life, and it'd be easy for me to
<BR>
credit something outside myself for some of that/ 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I've had bad things happen to me, and it'd be easy for me to
<BR>
ditto.
<BR>
d) I have no sharp-edged, powerful idea what/if to credit for (c1) or
<BR>
(c2), nor any driving need to.
<BR>
e) I initiated and later gave up militant agnosticism in my teens.
<BR>
f) I had a crisis over the Problem of Evil in my teens.
<BR>
g) I have no interest in meeting anyone else's standards of rigor
<BR>
concerning such a quasimponderable.
<BR>
h) I find the freeze-out of cosmological constants in our closed
<BR>
universe to amuse me, as conceivably the barest possible hint of the
<BR>
existence of an Artist at work, of a creator locking the door and
<BR>
throwing away the key and chuckling sotto voce.
<BR>
i) Point (h) above doesn't throw me into paroxysms of guilt at still
<BR>
labeling myself an agnostic; it makes me laugh.
<BR>
j) I am still working on a (bad, in my view) tendency to claim more
<BR>
certainty in some cases than is warranted. 
<BR>
k) I seem to have the (j) matter well in hand in this tiny area; why
<BR>
abandon that?
<BR>
l) I get a kick out of tickling my God wiring from time to time.
<BR>
m) I like being ornery sometimes.
<BR>
<P>You and Max can call me a wuss, and you can mistrust me because I don't
<BR>
have a hard lock on whatever you call the (absolute? of course not!
<BR>
absolutely not!) (certainty? but what is that without absoluteness?)...
<BR>
...well, whatever you call your (dis)belief in the (non)existence of
<BR>
whatever you think (a) (G/g)od is(n't) or whatever (G/g)od supposedly
<BR>
told someone else. (Are you at least smiling yet?)
<BR>
<P>BIG OL' DAMN CAVEAT: Now, all that aside, &quot;God Sez&quot; has been a really
<BR>
shitty excuse for much very bad behavior over time, and I can well
<BR>
understand a passionate reaction to that. Indeed, I experienced one. I
<BR>
can imagine more of the same if/when I come face to face with such in
<BR>
the future.
<BR>
<P>But these days, I try not to waste my time arguing.
<BR>
<P>Michael (Go ahead and judge me. Ego absolvo (absolvatur?) te, life's too
<BR>
short not to.)
<BR>
<P>Looking forward to the day when he can determine experimentally how many
<BR>
agnostics can dance without dissolving into a banal abyss of pinheaded
<BR>
certainty...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Upon reading some of the responses to Max's original post on God,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrogance and belief, it strikes me that there seems to be a sort of fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of commitment to the term &quot;atheist.&quot;  In my experience, many who call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves agnostic and cringe at the word &quot;atheist&quot; have a deep rooted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear of possible repercussions from taking a firm stand on such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-description --almost as if the slightest percentage of a possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of God Itself (usually in the traditional 'image of man' form) condemning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's soul to eternal damnation is enough to leave the loophole in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Quibbling over semantics is not the real issue; the real issue is why many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational thinkers cannot trust their rational beliefs enough to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves atheists.  With all due respect to the self-proclaimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agnostics, I find such a belief position weak and compromising, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; underlying fear of commitment to one's most rational desires and thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as its basis.  The bottom line is this: either there are gods (or God, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you prefer) or there are not.  I cannot prove one way or the other, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a tremendously strong, rational belief that no God or gods exist.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those who take such an either\or, compromising view as Agnosticism, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not put much weight on any other view which they claim to support either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the same reason why many like-minded individuals could have a far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friendlier conversation with a fundamental Christian, Buddhist --whatever--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than with a non-committing Agnostic.
