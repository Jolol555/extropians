<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
Michael and Joe exchanged a set of messages with relatively
<BR>
low information content (which I generally do not mind since
<BR>
we are all friends here *right*!?!)
<BR>
<P>Then On Tue, 15 Feb 2000, Joe E. Dees wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just a gentle reminder that one thing has NOT changed on this list; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you favorite topic is STILL banned.
</EM><BR>
<P>that was following a comment that might have been considered &quot;baiting&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Then someone else commented on the lack of free speech seemed to
<BR>
confirm Joes comments and express a &quot;kick-the-dog&quot; attitude about
<BR>
this unfortunate situation.
<BR>
<P>Just so you don't feel the overlords aren't watching, I'll make
<BR>
a few comments...
<BR>
<P>To the best of my knowledge there is no current censorship or
<BR>
filtering of the messages on the list (the current requirements
<BR>
on having to be on the list to submit &quot;unfiltered&quot; posts,
<BR>
restricts junk mail until they begin forging our names from
<BR>
viruses embedded on our normal host systems.).
<BR>
<P>So, from my perspective that means you have &quot;free speech&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Free speech does not however extend to a blanket right to
<BR>
waste the disk space, CPU cycles and human-time of the
<BR>
list subscribers.
<BR>
<P>My mailbox is currently unfiltered.  If another flame war
<BR>
were to erupt that would require me to invest significant
<BR>
time and energy in installing &quot;junk&quot; filters, I would be
<BR>
strongly inclined to send bills for the time involved to
<BR>
the individuals who were responsible for that additional
<BR>
work.  Now &quot;responsible&quot; individuals (see the EI principles)
<BR>
would pay those bills, understanding that they had negatively
<BR>
impacted me (and the EI List) (not dissimilar from shouting &quot;FIRE&quot;
<BR>
when there is none in a crowded nightclub).  The &quot;irresponsible&quot;
<BR>
individuals (not paying the bills), I'd just haul into court
<BR>
(even though I might lose) simply based on the principle of
<BR>
&quot;time&quot;=&quot;money&quot; and if you cost me time, I'm going to get it
<BR>
back from you one way or another.
<BR>
<P>[In this context I am promoting *rational* thought regarding
<BR>
the impact of the messages you post.  What you mail to another
<BR>
individual is &quot;private speech&quot; and I don't care what you say.
<BR>
What you post to the list is &quot;public speech&quot; and it involves
<BR>
impressions, costs and impacts on the people reading those posts.]
<BR>
<P>So if you *knowingly* post a message to the list that is designed
<BR>
to do nothing more than &quot;tease the dog&quot;, then you should think twice.
<BR>
Note: I include *myself* in this category!  If you want to &quot;tease
<BR>
the dog&quot; do it in private with the dog, not on the list.  I will
<BR>
admit there is a fine line here in using rhetorical devices to
<BR>
get someone to see your point and simply stirring the muddy
<BR>
waters.  It takes careful re-reading to determine whether you
<BR>
are trying to keep things at DEFCON 1 or 2 or whether you are
<BR>
seeking to push them to DEFCON 3 or 4.]
<BR>
<P>If the &quot;wake-UP&quot; calls didn't work, I'd begin discussions with
<BR>
the board about only allowing paid-up EI members to subscribe to
<BR>
the list (after all we are providing a service, no?)
<BR>
and then lobby for a &quot;nuisance&quot; tax on inflamatory messages.
<BR>
[Of course we would institute an impartial &quot;peer&quot;-review
<BR>
committee for what constitutes and inflamatory message
<BR>
(or maybe just let the list as a whole vote on it -- as I
<BR>
alluded to in the jury thread).]
<BR>
<P>If none of the above worked, I'd simply take my toys
<BR>
and go play elsewere.  I'm sure there are venues where
<BR>
the people are more interested in understanding positions
<BR>
and reasonings from which they are derived rather than
<BR>
simply assaulting other &quot;beings&quot; with said positions.
<BR>
<P>As the recent discussions regarding &quot;subject lines&quot; shows.
<BR>
We can have some *very* divergent opinions and still manage
<BR>
to understand those positions and discover how a small
<BR>
sacrifice in &quot;free speech&quot; might be to the benefit of
<BR>
the readers.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this points out the difference between members
<BR>
of a community and evangelical preachers.
<BR>
<P>Robert
