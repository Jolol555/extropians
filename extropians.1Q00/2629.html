*winces* wow, that must be unpleasant at times. But
<BR>
don't worry...too much...everyone's parents are
<BR>
adamant about certain things... in my mom's case,
<BR>
eating and dating... I skipped a meal last night, now
<BR>
she's sure that not only am I vegetarian, but I have
<BR>
some absurd eating disorder...and I have hard times
<BR>
with her about my friends, several of which are
<BR>
male...she occasionally sits me down and tells me how
<BR>
important it is not to be sexually active...and then
<BR>
makes quips about me dating my best friend. One plus
<BR>
being that they don't force me to go to church... but
<BR>
that doesn't help you any...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; yesterday I got into a 'discussion' (which turned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 'her screaming at me and running off' thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunately) with a girl at my school, when she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started talking about how &quot;God's going to end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&quot; and stuff like that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's happened to you, too? Once a girl sat down on
<BR>
the bus and wouldn't move...she kept going on and on
<BR>
about how evil snakes are because they kicked adam and
<BR>
eve out of the garden...I turned around and told her
<BR>
quite logically told her some things, and the next
<BR>
moment I was apparently a satanist of the worst sort,
<BR>
among other things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh, if only! Everyone else in my family is highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religious; only recently have I made the only slight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inroad of progress so far, talking my mom out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making me attend church (they're Catholics) every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sunday morning (although I'm supposed to spend that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hour at home reading religious literature).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eventually....
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd try to bully your parents into letting you read
<BR>
cultural things... and maybe try to push into some
<BR>
research on the 'heathens' if you frame it the right
<BR>
way... you might as well try to squeeze as much
<BR>
knowledge out of those hours as you can, and even
<BR>
reading the bible comes in handy in terms of
<BR>
literature...authors keep making obscure
<BR>
references.... Anyway, I hope my feeble suggestions
<BR>
come to some help.
