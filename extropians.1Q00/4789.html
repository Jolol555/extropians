<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Crime%20and%20Safety%20engineering%20[was:%20Ooh%20a%20gun%20fight!!]&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000314015049.55263.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this premise, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of Congress) to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and enact laws that can keep people from suing the gun manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are highly misguided.  [I might be willing to grandfather certain very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old weapons, but modern day products should be engineered to be safe.]
</EM><BR>
<P>What you say is so obviously correct that, but for the efforts of the NRA 
<BR>
and its proponents, it hardly needs saying.  We recognize that cars, in the 
<BR>
wrong hands, are dangerous.  So we do what we can to make them safer, by 
<BR>
requiring that they come with such &quot;unnecessary&quot; parts as turn signals, seat 
<BR>
belts and headlights.  We also require that drivers demonstrate their 
<BR>
competence at driving before they are allowed to do it.  They must be 
<BR>
licensed and their licenses must be renewed from time to time.  There are 
<BR>
databases which contain the name and address of every car owner in the 
<BR>
country.  If their car is used in a crime or an injury-causing accident the 
<BR>
owner can be identified.  Thank God there is no car-owners equivalent of the 
<BR>
NRA, or none of that would be possible.  Thank God also that this country 
<BR>
will wake up one day, do the right thing and defeat the vocal minority of 
<BR>
2nd Amendment fanatics in this country.
