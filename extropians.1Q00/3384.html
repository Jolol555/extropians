<BR>
So I imagined a future in which the religious were obliged to give birth to 
<BR>
every possible deformed and mutant offspring, sapping their resources and 
<BR>
driving out the last few intelligent members.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I found your post very interesting.  It would make for a good science 
<BR>
fiction novel about a lost colony or a community in a postapocalyptic world. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-written it could be very gut wrenching.  Get started on it, Damien!  
<BR>
And even if all offspring were healthy, it would still put a terrible strain 
<BR>
on a community.
<BR>
<P>Another plot line would be where a large, space colony bourne religious 
<BR>
community with advanced nanotech which disallows birth control but allows 
<BR>
the use of science to cure birth defects.  The use of science to raise the 
<BR>
children in artificial wombs is even widely done but seen as God's way of 
<BR>
allowing the doctrine to be carried forth.  The women wind up having far 
<BR>
more children then they would have under normal condition.
<BR>
<P>I have a hard time with the Catholic doctrines you based your post on, 
<BR>
though I started out Catholic myself.  Of course, many Catholics today 
<BR>
ignore the Vatican directive not to use birth control and would laugh at the 
<BR>
idea of seriously doing what you suggested as a logical conclusion to 
<BR>
Catholic doctrines.  The lives of individuals and doctrines and histories of 
<BR>
organizations can be full of contradictions.
<BR>
<P>I once saw a cartoon that showed the world jammed full of people in the year 
<BR>
3000 with the vatican finally announcing that birth control is to be 
<BR>
allowed!
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
