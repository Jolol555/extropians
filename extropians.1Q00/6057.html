<P>
Hal discussed that &quot;the protein problem is not understood&quot;.
<BR>
John commented &quot;you can find its shape with X ray diffraction or NMR&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I'll offer several comments as to why this will move fast.
<BR>
1) It is recognized that you will have lots of gene sequences to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which you will want the actual structure.  Scientists involved
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this field (as documented in Science), are moving towards
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an assembly line approach (as was done with sequencing), to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow much, much faster throughput for crystalization and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X-ray diffraction or NMR.  Still, there will be some proteins
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for which you cannot get crystals.
<BR>
2) Computer modeling of the protein shape, based on first principles,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known shapes of protein &quot;motifs&quot; (that have been copied throughout
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the genomes), and expanded computer power (e.g. IBM's Blue Gene)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will converge to give highly accurate models for those proteins
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that for which crystals are difficult, and even those for which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are easy.
<BR>
3) We will rapidly determine genes involved in specific pathways (through
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolutionary conservation across organisms), the regulatory sequences
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for genes (which must be conserved across organisms as well) and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathways in which they function (through differential expression studies).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing what genes stay together and play together, combined with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer analysis of the 3-D substructures that identify conserved
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regions, catalytic sites, phosphorylated amino acids, etc. will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow rapid assignment of functions.
<BR>
4) Much of the genome is involved in developmental processes and therefore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be left to &quot;cleanup&quot; efforts and/or those interested in basic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biology or birth defects.
<BR>
<P>All of this implies that within a few years, we should have identified
<BR>
the pathways and genes and functions responsible for the major diseases
<BR>
and pathologies.  Some solutions will be easy, and others will be difficult.
<BR>
But once the problems are identified, clever people can identify
<BR>
multiple possible targets and work on them until solutions are found.
<BR>
<P>So, I think over the next ten years people will be quite surprised
<BR>
at how fast things will move.
<BR>
