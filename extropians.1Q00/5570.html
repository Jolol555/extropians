<EM>&gt; you have to have simple organisms that don't have such adaptations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  The simplest organisms, living off either solar energy or
<BR>
energy produced by deep sea vents, got established *very* early,
<BR>
within a few hundred million years after the asteroid/cometary
<BR>
bombardment declined to non-sterilizing levels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You need an environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which life can arise, solve the basic survival problems like energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production and reproduction, and reach a level of complexity that allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex adaptations to evolve.  That implies that a world that has a stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period followed by wild climate swings may support interesting life, but one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has always had extreme shifts may not evolve life in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  But the evidence suggests we have suggests that primitive
<BR>
organisms (bacteria and archea) that are able to survive over a much
<BR>
wider range of environments frozen to ~100C (at high pressures) than
<BR>
can complex animals at this time.  So the adaptations to these
<BR>
environments could occur in simple organisms and then be incorporated
<BR>
into more complex organisms.  On our planet the vectors seems to have
<BR>
taken two directions.  One, that evolves greater complexity and a second
<BR>
that seems to have evolved adaptation to environmental extremes.  Now,
<BR>
it may be that the extreme environment vector for life was a direct
<BR>
result of extinction events (such as Snowball Earth).  There was
<BR>
only a limited &quot;complexification&quot; vector for a long time, perhaps
<BR>
because it kept getting truncated.  Only after Snowball Earth have
<BR>
things been stable enough for complexification to generate an
<BR>
explosion of species.  However on planets that always have extreme
<BR>
environmental swings, the only vector that can develop is one
<BR>
that includes first extreme tolerance followed by complexification.
<BR>
It may take longer since you probably have some energy and reproduction
<BR>
costs associated with the environmental adaptations.  Its difficult
<BR>
to say however, whether the penalty for this is only millions or many
<BR>
billions of years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which leads me to what I found interesting about this whole theory.  IMO it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be rather unusual (to put it mildly) for a planet to undergo the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of shifts the authors are talking about without completely wiping out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  For bacteria and yeast, they freeze quite well.  So you
<BR>
simply can't remain frozen *too* long or have massive radiation exposures
<BR>
while frozen.  Archea on the other and can seek out the environmental
<BR>
extremes and live off unconventional energy sources, e.g. deep sea vents.
<BR>
Only if you vaporize the surface of the planet down to the bottom of
<BR>
the oceans and heat the first several km of rock (where bacteria may
<BR>
be living in buried organic material) do you wipe out all life.  So the
<BR>
questions with all extinction events, are, &quot;How severe is it?&quot;, and
<BR>
&quot;How much does it roll back the development of complexity?&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You need a combination of surface gravity, water abundance, solar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy levels and geography that falls within very narrow limits to get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of behavior they describe.  Disturb any one parameter by very much and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you either can't get large climate shifts, can't recover from one, or don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any enclaves where complex life can survive from one warm era to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha, but they (in Rare Earth) are careful to say that they are considering
<BR>
complex life primarily *as we know it*.  For example, I question their
<BR>
assumption that you need oxygen.  Yes, all complex life on earth requires
<BR>
oxygen.  However microbiology shows what you really need is free energy
<BR>
sources.  As I've mentioned in other discussions, I could see adapting
<BR>
humans to be solar powered.  We might have a slower life pace, but we
<BR>
would still be intelligent.  Whether complexity has to wait for the
<BR>
accumulation of oxygen is unclear.  The vector for the development of
<BR>
intelligent plants could have gone much further much sooner.  In our
<BR>
case, the Snowball events certainly would have reset evolutionary
<BR>
progress back to a low level.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Which, of course, would have interesting implications for the expected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abundance of sentient life in the universe.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.
