<P>
I have been very interested in the thread about a nanotech-gift economy.  I 
<BR>
will restate my own views on the subject.  When mature nanotech is here I 
<BR>
see a level of prosperity the developed nations will have never have seen 
<BR>
before.  Open-source designs will be available for just about anything one 
<BR>
could want.  But should a person want a state-of-the-art design they will 
<BR>
have to pay because a for profit company that designed that blueprint will 
<BR>
be selling it rather then giving it away.
<BR>
<P>So if you can tolerate having a generic and technically just adequate device 
<BR>
you go with open-source but if you want the best, latest and most innovative 
<BR>
you will pay for it.  And you get accompanying &quot;social status&quot; by paying for 
<BR>
the designs.  Of course advertising will reinforce the desire of people to 
<BR>
&quot;be cool&quot; and buy the latest designs.  &quot;Look at Larry, his clothes are 
<BR>
open-source, what a loser!&quot;
<BR>
The corporations will need income flowing in from sales to keep the R&amp;D work 
<BR>
going also.  Information even more then now and not the raw materials 
<BR>
really, will be what drives the economy.  Mature nanotech will truly make it 
<BR>
the information age.
<BR>
<P>Some variables regarding a nanotech-gift economy are to what extent would 
<BR>
A.I. make it easy to develop state of the art open-source designs?  
<BR>
Considering the computer power available in the 2030's and 40's I would 
<BR>
thing even a average citizen could with home A.I. help create some very 
<BR>
impressive products.  Of course an entire corporation's efforts would 
<BR>
probably far outdo his/her design but then when is enough ever enough?  In a 
<BR>
future prosperous society I see status symbols becoming sadly even more 
<BR>
important as people try to impress eachother.
<BR>
<P>Another question is the exact nature of a nanotechnology.  Is a bottle of 
<BR>
nanoassemblers simply poured over raw materials?  Or is it a device the size 
<BR>
of a microwave or a large refrigerator?  Would the models available to 
<BR>
consumers allow them to build homes or vehicles?
<BR>
<P>Considering the possible terrorist applications of nanotech (or even just an 
<BR>
accident of some kind) and how it would also threaten corporate interests I 
<BR>
could easily see heavy government regulation to the point that there would 
<BR>
be no chance for a nanotech-gift economy to ever develop.
<BR>
<P>In the name of national security nanotech assemblers could be kept under 
<BR>
wraps to be used only by corporations and government departments that are 
<BR>
cleared officially to do so.  Just as individuals don't get to have their 
<BR>
own private inhome nuclear reactors to power their house, so the mid 21st 
<BR>
citizen may be legally banned from personally using a technology that could 
<BR>
transform society and at the least severely bend the rules of the old 
<BR>
economic order.  I hope I am wrong on this point but I doubt it.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to critiques on this post.  I think I have brought up some 
<BR>
pertinant points.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
