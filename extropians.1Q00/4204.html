<P><EM>&gt; *thinks* I wonder... can the same memory be stored in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different parts of the brain? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Individual memories are apparently stored as modifications in synaptic
<BR>
connections in many neurons, so they are spread out across most of the
<BR>
brain already. The nice thing about distributed representations is
<BR>
that if you lose one part of the pattern, the whole is not lost. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could almost see some kind of process whereby a computer's neural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net was interfaced with a person's... and then, somehow, you kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shove...  *thinks* not very coherent in this form, but I'm sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking about whether or not a neuron has any natural capacity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfer it's state to another neuron... and whether some form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excitation could cause them to transfer along a chain.  Kind of like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providing space for it to move through...
</EM><BR>
<P>To my knowledge not. I'm working on memory transfer between the
<BR>
hippocampus and cortex, and there is no real evidence this can occur -
<BR>
which makes life much harder for me :-) What seems to happen in my
<BR>
reasearch is that one part of the brain can train another part to do
<BR>
the same function, but this a rather special case and likely not
<BR>
workable everywhere else.
<BR>
<P>As for uploading, I guess that if you integrate a computer with a
<BR>
neural network to your mind, and learn how to integrate the network
<BR>
with your thinking, gradually more and more of your thought processes
<BR>
would exist within the computing matrix. The problem is that &quot;you&quot;
<BR>
would be growing - it would not be that your memories and everything
<BR>
*moved* to the computer, but rather that new parts developed inside it
<BR>
enhancing your abilities. So the old brain would still be needed until
<BR>
enough interconnections had emerged to make it irrelevant - but that
<BR>
might not happen for some functions.
