<P>&lt;&lt; So I take it you
<BR>
&nbsp;would consider such a non complex machine which is clearly superior
<BR>
&nbsp;to the worlds best artist at resolving differences in color, to be a
<BR>
&nbsp;far better artist? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>OK, you can take cake too, and tea and scones, but it's nothing to so with 
<BR>
what I said. 
<BR>
<P>You might also call an electronic tape measure a better architect than Frank 
<BR>
Lloyd Wright . Why not assert that therefore, architecture's not complex?
<BR>
<P>Detecting a particular vibrational measurement neither negates nor indicates 
<BR>
the *concpets* complexity. It merely indicates the complexity of the device. 
<BR>
Nor does it describe the phenomenon red in any way. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How our vision works, the very fact that human beings INVENTED a machine 
<BR>
to do that, when there are millions of shades of that color which we can 
<BR>
quicly recognize under one heading,  is indicative of the complexity of the 
<BR>
concept humans invented to describe any color, even a simple primary color 
<BR>
like 'red.' 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;And it illustrates the lengths we go to qualify it, elusive as it is.
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;&lt;  Clearly the difference is, our representation of such a
<BR>
&nbsp;simple shade of red, though it isn't quite as complex, is simply
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;phenomenal&quot;, &quot;artful&quot;, &quot;spiritual&quot;, &quot;motivational&quot;, &quot;emotional&quot;,
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;joyful&quot;... or whatever you want to call it, rather than some
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;abstract&quot; or mapped, doesn't matter what the actual physical
<BR>
&nbsp;representation is made of binary number. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Here we go again, assuming that being an artist means a whole bunch of 
<BR>
touchy-feely emotional mystical subjective crap, - a &quot;gift&quot; from above, not a 
<BR>
feat of engineering the mind/body connection. Fine of the senses through 
<BR>
training, practice and discipline of intense nature. 
<BR>
<P>Music and the arts are measurable sciences. Numbers are part of that. 
<BR>
Integrated until nearly intuitive, yes,  but always present.
<BR>
<P>The results are for the enjoyment and emotions, but the art itself is a 
<BR>
mechanical process, and obeys a body of laws or principles just like any 
<BR>
other technology.
<BR>
<P>Just because you don't understand them, don't assign mystic spiritual values 
<BR>
to those who do.
