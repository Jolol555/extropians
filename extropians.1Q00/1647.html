Hi Jeff Davis,
<BR>
<P>You Said in part...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your original post got me to thinking.  My feeling is that all the bits and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pieces of the &quot;ecocosm&quot;--as you so aptly call it--play a range of roles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;both cooperative and competitive, so looking for the beneficial role for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viruses strikes me as a bit of good outside-the-box logic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks so much for the virus info and legwork...the reason I put this
<BR>
question to the extr..list was that I didn't have the background to know
<BR>
where to &quot;swing the Axe&quot; at the available info...and your extraordinary
<BR>
kindness has helped me see where to start.
<BR>
<P>I think outside the box because I am happy and have achieved a level of
<BR>
intellectual humility...because without humility, nothing important can be
<BR>
learned.
<BR>
<P>If information starts as large as the universe, and grows at a rate &gt;
<BR>
factorial of the rate of accellerating discovery, then we must - by
<BR>
definition be nearly totally ignorant. That is the mathematical/scientific
<BR>
basis of rational humility. To deny this creates profound blindness.
<BR>
<P>I have always been amazed at how closed minded even those of +140 IQ
<BR>
are...in fact, if there were a reliable measure of &quot;closed mindedness&quot;, my
<BR>
intuition is that high IQ correlates very closely with closed mindedness
<BR>
(for reference, I'm 152 or so). Why?  because the low self-esteem generated
<BR>
during the &quot;boy you sure are wierd&quot; social/familial experiences of geeky
<BR>
childhood, results in an extraordinarily strong desire to be right at all
<BR>
costs cause being &quot;right&quot; is one thing that hi-IQ folks can be very good at.
<BR>
I think this is one of the reasons for frequent nitpicking and &quot;much ado
<BR>
about not much&quot; on this list.
<BR>
<P>ie...The reason books are so powerful is not because of cheap replication.
<BR>
Primarily, it is because ideas in print sneak past the &quot;I must have the idea
<BR>
first if I'm gonna own it&quot; ego watchdog. Ideas we read, are easy to annex as
<BR>
our own. No one can hear or see us do it - including ourself...so I don't
<BR>
have to &quot;give credit&quot;. Once I grew up, I realized that I spoke the ideas as
<BR>
if they were my own all the time. Yet, I rarely had an original idea. After
<BR>
I became aware of this phenomenon, I stopped thinking that original ideas
<BR>
were important....what's really important is deliberate choices to do or not
<BR>
do something about the ideas...and - oddly enough, now I have original
<BR>
ideas...all the time.
<BR>
<P>Another phenomenon of High IQ. &quot;As soon as I can conceive of the
<BR>
inevitability of a thing, I won't do anything about it to either stop it or
<BR>
make it happen&quot;...why? because &quot;it's inevitable...why bother&quot;. Thus, the
<BR>
vast majority of high IQ folks live lives of &quot;didn't really do anything
<BR>
important&quot;. This is why I didn't renew Mensa membership after the first
<BR>
year.
<BR>
<P>Thanks Again,
<BR>
Dave Gobel
