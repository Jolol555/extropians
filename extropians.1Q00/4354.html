<EM>&gt; What if I want to get rid of my truck, and need toothpicks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an iron, an old copy of Dos 3.0 and a credit to do something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later with (actually, I need to pay my debts and buy groceries).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The owner of Dos wants flowers; the owner of iron wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a movie ticket, toothpicks are not there, my lender wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cash, and my grocer is offline.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It may be quite complicated in many cases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matching is harder too than just exchange for cash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But barter definitely has some benefits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are people who don't like money, and people who don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like IRS, and just curious people...
</EM><BR>
<P>Look up Yankee Magazine. There has been a Swopper section there for
<BR>
decades, its got some serious adherents. People swop everything from
<BR>
magazine collections and baseball cards to antiques and vacation time at
<BR>
waterfront or other resort locations, massages, legal work, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if you include currency as one of the goods, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the service could have all kinds of transactions, some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them taxable, some not?  Then you don't have a barter-vs-cash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dilemma, you have a service that does everything that others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do, plus barter...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are also alternate currencies that do not have to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exchanged for $.  That's also hard to tax.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They can have external backing.  Like, in rights to stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at one's home as a guest or in personal sexual favors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let the govt tax those  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Having some sort of a commodity exchange rating database set up, so that
<BR>
the history files tell me that 1987 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4x4s are worth
<BR>
one 1986 Chevette, two tire irons, and a grease gun, alternately its
<BR>
worth 200 cases of Budweiser and a bottle of Jack Daniels. If the same
<BR>
database says that a bottle of Jack Daniels is worth two cases of
<BR>
Budweiser, I know the exact value in cases of Budweiser of my Jeep.
