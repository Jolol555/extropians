<P><EM>    &gt;France's entire nuke  program  is made up of breeder reactors,
</EM><BR>
<P>The entire program? I don't think so!
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;which are also capable of burning off nuclear  waste.
</EM><BR>
<P>Burning off? Please explain what that means. Exactly what nuclear waste
<BR>
product are we talking about? What is the nuclear reaction that renders
<BR>
this &quot;waste&quot; harmless. What stops this &quot;burning&quot; from making more waste
<BR>
than it gets rid of.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Thats why France has nowhere near the waste problem we do,
</EM><BR>
<P>They may not have the political problem that the USA has as to where to
<BR>
permanently store highly radioactive material but that has nothing to do
<BR>
with technology.

<P><EM>    &gt; Plutonium in the IFR would never leave the containment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;High level wastes were blanketed around the reactor to absorb
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;stray neutrons, thereby speeding their decay.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is that going to work? OK, a neutron might turn a cobalt 60
<BR>
atom into a harmless isotope of nickel but a neutron could also
<BR>
turn U238 into plutonium or cause U235 to fission and produce
<BR>
more cobalt 60, or turn common potassium into potassium 40.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; World stocks of Pu are a rich source of power. They are not a liability
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; unless they are NOT burned in power plants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Getting rid of weapons grade plutonium in power plants might be a good idea
<BR>
but you don't need a breeder for that.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; The problem here in the US is that the anti-nuke crowd refuses to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; reprocessing,
</EM><BR>
<P>Thousands of tons of plutonium exist on the earth and more is made every day,
<BR>
but most of it is mixed in with other extremely lethal radioactive waste so it's
<BR>
very hard to work with without separating it out in a chemical reprocessing plant.
<BR>
It only takes a few pounds to make a bomb so I want it hard to work with, I don't
<BR>
want a reprocessing plant.
