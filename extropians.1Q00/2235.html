&nbsp;&nbsp;WAR ON ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN WRITERS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;By Ian Williams Goddard
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter McWilliams, author of the classic civil-libertarian 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;treatise &quot;Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do,&quot; [1] is facing 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up to 5 years in prison for growing cannabis, which he used 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to treat symptoms of AIDS. [2] In 1996, Californians voted 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to legalize cannabis smoking and growing for medical purposes, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;yet two years later McWilliams was arrested in California for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;growing cannabis to treat AIDS. By arresting a well-known 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;author and activist for consensual activity approved by The 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People, the government is sending the message that democracy 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will not stand in the way of its war on consensual medicine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent the possibility of justice, the court prohibited 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;McWilliams from informing the jury that he has AIDS, that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannabis has therapeutic value for AIDS patients, and that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;California legalized the medical use of cannabis. In short, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the court prohibited McWilliams' defense -- a kangaroo court 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by definition -- in an antidemocratic effort to override the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law stipulated by The People. Having been found guilty of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;growing cannabis, Peter McWilliams now faces sentencing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we also consider the recent persecution by the legal 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;system of investigative journalists James Sanders and David 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffman for their separate efforts to make evidence about 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Flight 800 crash and the Oklahoma City bombing known, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[3] it becomes clear that U.S. authorities are bypassing 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;traditional restraints on the abuse of power -- restrains 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that differentiate democratic from fascist societies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;McWilliams, Sanders, and Hoffman are all well-known 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authors and outspoken critics of the authorities, they 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are the &quot;loyal opposition&quot; by definition, and they are the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of people who end up in jail in totalitarian societies. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;While being financially devastated in the process, both 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;David Hoffman and James Sanders narrowly escaped prison 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;time for their &quot;crimes&quot; against authoritarianism. Now 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;another anti-authoritarian author, Peter McWilliams, is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;staring down the barrel of a 5-year-prison sentence. You 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;may be able to help end this assault on both freedom and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy by writing a *cordial* letter to Judge King on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;McWilliams behalf: <A HREF="http://www.petertrial.com/letters.htm">http://www.petertrial.com/letters.htm</A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;========================================================
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM PETER MCWILLIAMS:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;========================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-2-2000
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Peter McWilliams.  I am a cancer survivor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living with AIDS.  I was arrested in July 1998 on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;federal medical marijuana charges, even though I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live in California, a state that approved medical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marijuana use in 1996.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1999, the federal prosecutors
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success fully obtained an order prohibiting me from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioning to the jury that I have AIDS, that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marijuana is medicine, that the federal government
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplies eight patients with medical marijuana each
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month, or that California has a law permitting the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very act that I was accused of violating.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I never denied my medical marijuana cultivation,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that left me with no defense whatsoever.  To avoid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an almost certain guilty verdict and a ten-year
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mandatory-minimum sentence, I pled guilty to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lesser charge.  (The whole story is at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.petertrial.com">http://www.petertrial.com</A> )  My sentencing for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this charge will be on March 27, 2000.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deadline for turning in letters of support is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 20, 2000.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you please take the time to send a letter,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a fax, or even an e-mail, to the judge on my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behalf?  It would make all the difference in my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter need not be long or eloquent.  One
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence is sufficient.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge can sentence me to 0 to 5 years.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;federal sentencing guidelines place my recommended
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(but not mandatory) sentence in the 5-year range.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probably unavoidable that I get a sentenced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to some time -- perhaps the full five years.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking the judge -- and what I am asking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you to ask the judge -- is that I be able to serve
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my sentence under &quot;home detention,&quot; also known as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;electronic monitoring.&quot;  (An electronic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transmitter would b  permanently fastened to my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ankle and my whereabouts would be monitored 24
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours a day.  I would not be able to leave my home
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for medical or court appointments.  As I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live in Los Angeles, this will allow me to write
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my books, including Galileo LA.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In writing the Judge King, please observe these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonsense guidelines:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Please be respectful.  The judge owes me, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, nothing.  You are asking for a favor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Judge King was asked to allow me to use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical marijuana while out on bail, he said
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the attorneys on both sides, in a voice
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trembling with compassion, &quot;I am struggling
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mightily with this.  Please, struggle with me.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, there was nothing in federal law that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permitted him to allow me to break federal law,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even to save my life, but I believed the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sincerity of his struggle.  Personally, I don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want judges rewriting law as they see fit.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge King is a good judge upholding a bad law.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sentence, however, is at his discretion.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe he will be fair, that he will read
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the letter you send, and he will be moved by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your heartfelt request.  I believe we owe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courtesy to the King.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Please focus on my health
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://www.petertrial.com/undetectable.htm">http://www.petertrial.com/undetectable.htm</A>)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my contributions to society (through my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;books -- <A HREF="http://www.mcwilliams.com/books">http://www.mcwilliams.com/books</A>) as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons why I should receive home detention
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or electronic monitoring (the term can be used
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interchangeably).  The legal arguments will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be made by my attorney.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  If you know me, please say so, and state any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;positive character traits you may have noticed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wafting by from time to time.  (This letter is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not written under oath, so you will not be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrested for perjury.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  If you have read any of my books, please say
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so.  If they helped you, please say how.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exception: Please do not mention &quot;Ain't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody's Business If You Do.&quot;  See 5.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Please do not give your opinion of the War on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs (unless you're in favor of it), how the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government treated me in this case (unless you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approve), your views on medical marijuana
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unless you're against it), or anything else
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;critical of the status quo.  Save those
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remarks, however well-reasoned and accurate,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for letters-to-the-editor.  Such comments may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be counterproductive in a letter to a federal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  If you can, please keep the letter to one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;page, and no longer than two.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual letters (those things made popular in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last millennium, printed on paper, put into
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;envelopes, and sent through the Post Office) are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best.  Typed is better, but handwritten is fine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please use the most impressive letterhead to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which you have legitimate access.  (Your business
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stationery is better than your personal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stationery, for example.)  If you don't have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stationery, you can create a letterhead on any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word processor in about two minutes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please address the letters to &quot;The Honorable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George H. King&quot; and begin the letter &quot;Dear Judge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King,&quot;.  Please mail the letters TO ME at:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter McWilliams, 8165 Mannix Drive, Los Angeles,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CA 90046.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know you're probably not going to get
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around to writing a letter (and I know just how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you feel -- I don't know where to find an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;envelope any more, much less a stamp -- please
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send a fax (signed, on letterhead, if possible,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if not, that's fine) to (323) 650-1541.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think you might not get around to sending
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fax, please send an e-mail.  Please write at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bottom of the e-mail &quot;You have my permission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reformat this letter, print it, and sign my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name at the bottom.&quot;  Your name will be signed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you, next to which will be the initials of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the person signing it.  Please include your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete mailing address.  The e-mail address is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peter@mcwilliams.com.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, please circulate this request as widely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you can -- post it on bulletin boards, send it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receptive people on your e-mail list, send it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out in newsletters, put it on your web page.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly use your creativity, but, please, no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spamming.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot post the entire message of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missive, the online address of this request is

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you from the bottom of my weary but very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grateful heart.
