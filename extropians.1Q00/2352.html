<P>
I would ask the questions John Clark asked, but in more extended form,
<BR>
with specific cases:
<BR>
<P>- Why court, bacteria, criminals, accidents, Gods,
<BR>
according to some beliefs, wild animals, aging process,
<BR>
and just about anyone and anything else, can decide to
<BR>
terminate a person's life, but the person can't?
<BR>
<P>- What if I decide that my purpose of life is accomplished,
<BR>
and want to just quietly leave?
<BR>
<P>- What if the person's burden of guilts, pains, or displeasures
<BR>
is unbearably high?  Who has a right to tell people that they
<BR>
should continue the existence that brings them extreme, unbearable
<BR>
pain, and what can be the reason for it?
<BR>
<P>- Is it justifiable to give a poison pill to a person who is
<BR>
about to be tortured to death by sadistic criminals?
<BR>
<P>- What if people are mad biologically immortal (I assume this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bioethicist supports prevention of death from diseases - it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be illogical to give bacteria a right over a person's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life that the person himself doesn't have), then does it mean
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the person absolutely has to live forever?
<BR>
<P>- Are there any other things that can't be terminated, including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal possessions, or one's life is an exception?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the basis for this exception?
<BR>
<P>- Does this refer to personality as a whole, or sub-personality,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as particular set of interests and concepts?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is one allowed to terminate a certain line of actions or thoughts?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it only biological existence that can't be terminated?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, can biological existence of chickens be terminated?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about carrots?
<BR>
<P>- What if my religion requires me to end my life in certain cases?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an invalid religion with invalid ethics?  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I tell which religion is valid?
<BR>
