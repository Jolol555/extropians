(From other sources, I get the impression that Japan might be truly clued. 
<BR>
Heck, even their anime is pretty clued. Look to the Japanese to be the first 
<BR>
culture to emotionally accept the upheaval ahead.) I am very interested in 
<BR>
knowing how much China knows, seeing as how the Orient looks to be the 
<BR>
bogeyman of this century.

<BR>
<P>Very interesting comments.  As I understand, the Japanese government and 
<BR>
academia saw the promise in nanotech long before the United States did and 
<BR>
funded appropriately.  And so a hidden major reason for the Clinton 
<BR>
administration's generous funding of nano research is to deal with the 
<BR>
foreign competition!  Competition can be a good thing, eh?
<BR>
<P>Considering the nature of Japanese anime, I would say they look forward to a 
<BR>
technologically transformed society and that they, like the west, have some 
<BR>
strong fervor for apocalyptic views.  When giant transforming robots are a 
<BR>
staple of modern militaries we had all better watch out for Japan though! 
<BR>
lol!
<BR>
<P>I do also worry about China.  I hope they can learn to live peaceably with 
<BR>
the rest of their global neighbors.  I think of China like an adolescent 
<BR>
male who was pushed around alot by neighborhood bullies who have since grown 
<BR>
up and matured emotionally.  But the victim of this is still carrying a big 
<BR>
grudge and wants to kick some butt to prove his place in the neighborhood.  
<BR>
The question is, can we guide this lad of one billion people to that state 
<BR>
of societal maturity without a major hot or cold war??
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
