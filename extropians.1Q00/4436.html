<P>
With the arrival of Paypal, which charges no annual fees and no
<BR>
transaction percentages for credit-card-based money transfers to any
<BR>
email address in the US, inertialess money is finally here.  (Paypal
<BR>
intends to make money off the interest accrued on cash floating in their system.)
<BR>
<P>This heralds the beginning of a seismic shift in the economic structure.
<BR>
&nbsp;It will herald the dawn of micropayments, take a huge bite out of the
<BR>
dominance of cash, eventually kick over the credit-card system now used,
<BR>
and perhaps create a great Webbed structure of cash applause.  For some
<BR>
years now, I've visualized a system where, each time one visits a
<BR>
sufficiently great Website, one clicks a button that sends a few cents
<BR>
to the owner.  Websites, mailing posts, bon mots, good causes, great
<BR>
ideas - all upheld and rewarded by a system of cash applause that, with
<BR>
the rise of ultraproductivity, may become a dominant part of the social
<BR>
system.  Those who distribute the largest tips would see more pages and
<BR>
posts and jokes written to please them, providing a means whereby
<BR>
greater wealth translates into greater status and cultural dominance,
<BR>
while simultaneously creating a fog of money which helps to ensure that
<BR>
the have-nots don't starve.
<BR>
<P>By way of bringing this future to pass, I've already sent $10 apiece to
<BR>
Vernor Vinge and Ed Regis for completely changing my life at the ages of
<BR>
fifteen and eleven respectively, and I've kicked back $1 to Eric Watt
<BR>
Forste for running a website that was one of the major stepping stones
<BR>
on my path to transhumanism.  I'd send some dough to Mitchell Porter
<BR>
(for &quot;Hyper-Weirdness by WWW&quot;) and Anders Sandberg (for the &quot;Anders
<BR>
Transhuman Page&quot;), but I believe they live outside the US, so I'll wait
<BR>
until Paypal extends its reach.
<BR>
<P>If you have somebody you'd like to cheer on with the green folding
<BR>
applause, or at least blue electronic applause, then this is your chance
<BR>
to sign up with Paypal.  If you sign up to the extent of entering a
<BR>
credit card, you get a free $10 in your account, which can be withdrawn
<BR>
(!) or sent on as applause for your favorite transhumanist Websites.  If
<BR>
you sign up using the link
<BR>
&nbsp;https://secure.paypal.com/refer/pal=sentience%40pobox.com
<BR>
to register (*), you and I both get a free $10 in our account (although
<BR>
I believe it drops to $5 after March 15th).
<BR>
<P>Let's hear it for the future, for the rise of the inertialess economy,
<BR>
and for free money from the venture capitalists!
<BR>
<P>Yours in Singularity,
<BR>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

(*)  I offered both ExI and Foresight the chance to be in this link over
two weeks ago, but I got a response from neither; time is running out on
the offer; I would be posting about Paypal and the social consequences
even if they weren't offering me $10 to do it; therefore, I'm going
ahead with my own account reference.
