<EM>&gt; With the arrival of Paypal, which charges no annual fees and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transaction percentages for credit-card-based money transfers to any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; email address in the US, inertialess money is finally here.  (Paypal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intends to make money off the interest accrued on cash floating in their system.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that PayPal and similar systems have great potential for
<BR>
providing low cost user-to-user electronic money transfers.  As I wrote
<BR>
last week, they recently announced a merger with x.com, another company
<BR>
doing something similar.  eBay has announced their own payment system,
<BR>
BillPoint, partnering with Wells Fargo Bank.  And yesterday, Bank One
<BR>
announced their eMoneyMail service which will also let you transfer
<BR>
money to other people electronically.  For gold bugs, e-gold and a
<BR>
competitor starting soon called GoldMoney.com will allow you to open
<BR>
accounts denominated in grams of gold that can be used to pay other
<BR>
account holders.  Most of these systems besides Paypal charge fees, but
<BR>
perhaps with competition they will be forced to eliminate them eventually.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This heralds the beginning of a seismic shift in the economic structure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It will herald the dawn of micropayments, take a huge bite out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominance of cash, eventually kick over the credit-card system now used,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and perhaps create a great Webbed structure of cash applause.  For some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years now, I've visualized a system where, each time one visits a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently great Website, one clicks a button that sends a few cents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the owner.  Websites, mailing posts, bon mots, good causes, great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas - all upheld and rewarded by a system of cash applause that, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rise of ultraproductivity, may become a dominant part of the social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen something similar beginning already.  Somebody on the e-gold
<BR>
lists posts with a .sig file saying something like, &quot;Interested in my
<BR>
two cents?  Click me two cents worth of e-gold!&quot; with a URL link you
<BR>
can click on and more or less automatically transfer $.02 to the guy.
<BR>
He said that he's gotten several dollars worth of donations in the few
<BR>
weeks he's been doing this.
<BR>
