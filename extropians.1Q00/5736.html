<BR>
DRUG MAY COMBAT MEMORY LOSS IN PARKINSON'S AND OTHER DISORDERS
<BR>
An experimental drug taken for a short period of time has been shown to
<BR>
reverse drug-induced &quot;working&quot; memory loss in monkeys, according a study
<BR>
published in the journal Science. Working memory enables people to briefly
<BR>
hold information while thinking and comprehending information. Drugs used
<BR>
to treat psychotic conditions can alter dopamine receptors in the brain,
<BR>
resulting in working memory impairments.

<P>SCIENTISTS DISCOVER TWO PROCESSES INVOLVED IN BREAST CANCER
<BR>
Researchers have discovered two cellular processes that trigger the spread
<BR>
of breast cancer. University of Iowa researchers showed that aberrant
<BR>
cytosine methylation and chromatin condensation shut off maspin (mammary
<BR>
serine protease inhibitor), a gene that suppresses tumor development in
<BR>
healthy breast tissue. When maspin is silenced, tumor cells grow and
<BR>
spread. The scientists indicated the discovery is an important step toward
<BR>
development of drugs that prompt maspin expression. The scientists
<BR>
indicated the discovery is an expression.

Protocols
<BR>
---------
<BR>
ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX
<BR>
Esophageal reflux occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter malfunctions,
<BR>
allowing the backward flow of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.
<BR>
Being overweight or pregnant, over-eating, smoking, eating fatty and spicy
<BR>
foods and specific foods like citrus fruits, peppermint, and chocolate,
<BR>
will cause reflux as will drinking alcohol, coffee, and carbonated drinks.
<BR>
The main symptom of esophageal reflux is heartburn, which feels like a
<BR>
burning sensation beginning in the stomach and sometimes moving upward
<BR>
into the chest and throat. 
<BR>
Taking an antacid after a meal will usually reduce the risk of heartburn.
<BR>
Maintaining a reasonable weight, avoiding the foods mentioned above,
<BR>
eating smaller meals more often (four or five meals a day instead of
<BR>
three large ones), and sleeping on the left side with your head elevated
<BR>
4 to 6 inches above the rest of your body are a few measures people can
<BR>
take to avoid heartburn.

<P>IMMUNE ENHANCEMENT
<BR>
The Life Extension Foundation's Immune Enhancement protocol is designed to
<BR>
enhance immune function in aging patients, in patients receiving cancer
<BR>
chemotherapy, and in those suffering from chronic viral or bacterial
<BR>
infections.
<BR>
Free radicals have been linked to immune-system damage that accompanies
<BR>
normal aging. A strong immune system is critical to the prevention of
<BR>
infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. It is thought that cancer cells
<BR>
form regularly, and that a vigilant immune response is therefore required
<BR>
to kill or deactivate these deformed cells before they become malignant
<BR>
tumors. Members of the Life Extension Foundation have long been encouraged
<BR>
to follow a daily antioxidant regimen that protects against
<BR>
immune-suppressing free radicals.
<BR>
Vitamins are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and protection
<BR>
against oxidants. Dietary supplementation with ascorbic acid, tocopherols,
<BR>
and vitamin B6 enhances several aspects of lymphocyte function. Benefits
<BR>
are most evident in the elderly.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>MALE HORMONE MODULATION THERAPY
<BR>
We know that many of the degenerative diseases of aging in men such as
<BR>
Type II diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease are related to
<BR>
a testosterone deficiency. We also know that common characteristics of
<BR>
middle-age and older age such as depression, abdominal fat deposition,
<BR>
muscle atrophy, low energy, and cognitive decline are also associated with
<BR>
less than optimal levels of free testosterone.(58,219)
<BR>
Both the synthetic and natural testosterone drugs require a prescription,
<BR>
and this prescription should only be written when blood or saliva tests
<BR>
reveal a testosterone deficiency.
<BR>
Alternative physicians usually prescribe testosterone creams and other
<BR>
types made at compounding pharmacies, whereas conventional doctors are
<BR>
more likely to prescribe a box of ready-made FDA-approved testosterone
<BR>
patches. All forms of natural testosterone are the same and all will
<BR>
markedly increase free testosterone in the blood or saliva.
<BR>
Caution: DO NOT REPLACE TESTOSTERONE IF YOU HAVE PROSTATE CANCER. Men with
<BR>
existing prostate cancer should follow an opposite approach as it relates
<BR>
to testosterone.

<BR>
<P>OBESITY
<BR>
Americans face a major health problem, and it's related to nutrition, or
<BR>
what could be called the dark side of nutrition. Being overweight or obese
<BR>
are underlying risk factors for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, heart
<BR>
disease, cancer and stroke. Obesity is a major cause of the overall loss
<BR>
of energy experienced by so many people.
<BR>
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a component of beef and milk that has
<BR>
been shown to reduce body fat in both animals and humans. CLA is essential
<BR>
for the transport of dietary fat into cells where it is used to build
<BR>
muscle, and produce energy. Fat that is not used for anabolic energy
<BR>
production is converted into newly stored fat cells. There are published
<BR>
research findings about how dietary CLA reduces body fat, but first let's
<BR>
take a look at why many Americans are now deficient in CLA compared with
<BR>
their parents.

<BR>
<P>VERTIGO
<BR>
Vertigo occurs most often in relationship to an infection, particularly if
<BR>
the ear is involved. This is called labyrinthitis. It is usually
<BR>
self-limiting. Vertigo which persists warrants a medical work up. Most
<BR>
often this work up will fail to disclose a cause. This is usually benign
<BR>
positional vertigo and is treated with certain head exercise.
<BR>
If conventional medicine is unable to treat vertigo successfully, you may
<BR>
want to consider taking medications that can correct a neurological
<BR>
deficit that may be causing your vertigo. Some people have found that 5 to
<BR>
10 mg per day of Hydergine can be an effective therapy for vertigo. Other
<BR>
people have successfully used 2400 to 4800 mg of piracetam per day for
<BR>
this condition. A third option is to take 20 to 40 mg of vinpocetine a
<BR>
day.

Product of the Week

<BR>
SUPER SAW PALMETTO / NETTLE ROOT FORMULA
<BR>
Published scientific literature, along with ten years of experience at the
<BR>
Life Extension Foundation, shows that saw palmetto extract by itself is
<BR>
effective in alleviating symptoms of benign prostate disease in most men.
<BR>
However, newly published studies reveal evidence that men over age fifty
<BR>
should add nettle root extract to the new saw palmetto extract for
<BR>
prevention purposes. As men age, their ratio of estrogen to testosterone
<BR>
increases, thus making it important to inhibit the effects of estrogens,
<BR>
sex hormone binding globulin and dihydrotestosterone. While saw palmetto
<BR>
protects against prostate enlargement caused by dihydrotestosterone,
<BR>
nettle root is required to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cells in
<BR>
response to estrogen and sex hormone binding globulin. Since we now have a
<BR>
molecular understanding of how nettle functions in the body, it would
<BR>
appear that most men could both prevent and effectively treat benign
<BR>
prostate hyperplasia by taking Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root. Super Saw
<BR>
Palmetto/Nettle Root contains a new methanolic nettle root extract which
<BR>
is more effective than the ethanolic extract.
