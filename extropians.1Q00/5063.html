<EM>&gt; Background:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.vouchers/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.vouchers/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.school.voucher.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.school.voucher.ap/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/1999/US/12/20/school.vouchers.02/">http://www.cnn.com/1999/US/12/20/school.vouchers.02/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, in both Florida and Ohio the voucher programs are down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the reasons are quite different.  In Cleveland they are saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its a violation of the separation between Church and State, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Florida they are saying that it violates the state's constitutional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirement to provide a &quot;high-quality system of free public schools&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, the voucher supporters seem to be vowing to pursue this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The articles seem to suggest that given the variability of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state constitutions, unless the Supreme Court says &quot;no vouchers&quot;, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are likely to get some split between voucher and non-voucher states.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the recent newspaper article, where I think it was claimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;60% (!) of Americans supported teaching both the theories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creationism and evolution side-by-side, of course it doesn't take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much to realize that if parents move their children en-mass to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;religious&quot; education, we are going to end up with a larger fraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the population who cannot think &quot;rationally&quot;.  [Unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe in the pipe-dream that a &quot;religious&quot; education will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promote rational thought and downplay &quot;miracles&quot;.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Just because they think both theories should be taught doesn't mean that
<BR>
they think both theories should be given any credence. My own parents
<BR>
put me through sunday school for some 10 years, but probably would have
<BR>
been worried about my intelligence if I actually took the genesis myth
<BR>
seriously.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, fairly often the finger-of-blame for the poor-quality public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; education goes to the teacher's unions.  How do extropians reconcile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the freedom people should have to organize for collective barginning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the result (which seems to be the freedom to teach poorly)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its the right to be stupid. As stupid as ya' wanna be....
