<EM>&gt;    IAN: The shots appear to be visible only from one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    side of the building, which is because the primary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    indicated sniper location is behind the building 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    when viewed from the other side -- I'm looking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    at the video now. From the visible side, the shots 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    are visible across a range of angles to the left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of the indicated gun muzzles. I don't believe any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    shots are seen from the angle that would be viewing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the guns from the rear.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I noticed was that, from the point of view of the gunmen, facing
<BR>
the compound, the camera was always off to their right.  There were never
<BR>
any flashes as you say with the camera behind the gunmen, nor are there
<BR>
any with the camera to the left of the gunmen.
<BR>
<P>You suggest that the building would obstruct the views if the camera were
<BR>
in front of the gunment (on the other side of the compound from where
<BR>
they are).  Possibly true, but it looked to me like the camera had a
<BR>
relatively steep view downward, and so unless the gunmen were very close
<BR>
to the walls of the building, they should still be visible.  Most of
<BR>
the flashes pointed out by Allard came from different locations around
<BR>
the compound (one on the tank, one an infantry-tank maneuver outside
<BR>
the building they were demolishing, a pair of bursts from within the
<BR>
courtyard, and flashes from outside the burning building that was near
<BR>
the pond).  Given that gunfire is occuring from a variety of positions
<BR>
we might expect some shots to be detected with the camera coming from
<BR>
a drastically different angle.
<BR>
<P>The fact that all of the flashes are seen from off to the right side
<BR>
is evidence in favor of the reflection hypothesis, depending on the
<BR>
orientation of the building.  In the late morning, the sun should be
<BR>
in the southeast, meaning that reflections should be most visible when
<BR>
the plane is northwest of the building.  This would mean that the large
<BR>
water pond or pool in the corner of the compound should be generally
<BR>
on the north side, so that as the plan &quot;turns the corner&quot; around that
<BR>
point it is in position to see reflections.  If you look at the reference
<BR>
Ian lists below, <A HREF="http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/Figures/Fig02.jpg">http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/Figures/Fig02.jpg</A>,
<BR>
you see that this is exactly the orientation of the compound.  In short,
<BR>
every one of the flashes seen is with the plane in the approximate
<BR>
position where a reflection would be likely to occur.
<BR>
<P>This stretches the bounds of coincidence, since we have at least 5
<BR>
flashes, all seen from this same angle.  If we divide the circle into
<BR>
quadrants, with reflections only visible from the northwest quadrant,
<BR>
the chance that the plane would have been in that section for all five
<BR>
flashes purely by coincidence is one in 1000.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    The question then is: are these flashes on the FLIR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the reflections of sunlight off debris on the ground? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    That was a big debate that the FBI abandoned not too 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    long after it was decisively proven by Maurice Cox, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a retired IR-imagry analyst, that the flashes can't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    be sunlight reflections. His fairly simple analyses 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in &quot;The Sun Reflection Geometry Report&quot; show several 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (<A HREF="http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm">http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm</A>) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    reasons why the flashes cannot be sun reflections. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think the FBI has fully abandoned this theory.  They did require
<BR>
that the test be conducted over ground that had been scattered with
<BR>
debris and glass, obviously hoping that this would in fact produce
<BR>
flashes and reflections.  According to some reports, they got some
<BR>
flashes, although whether they had the characteristics and appearance
<BR>
of the Waco flashes remains to be seen.
<BR>
<P>I didn't find Cox's analysis very convincing.  He sets up all
<BR>
these assumptions but doesn't indicate the limits of his reasoning.
<BR>
For example, he describes &quot;misses&quot; in azimuth, where the plane isn't in
<BR>
the right position to have seen a reflection.  He describes &quot;large&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;small&quot; misses, but never says what these mean quantitatively.  We need
<BR>
to know these values, plus the uncertainty which would be caused by
<BR>
tilted ground, etc.
<BR>
<P>Then in analyzing misses in altitude, he assumes the plane is at 9000
<BR>
feet!  Oops, as the recent news stories have made clear, the plane was
<BR>
at 4500 feet.  This not only eliminates this objection, it casts doubt on
<BR>
his azimuth calculations since the plane wasn't where he thought it was.
<BR>
It also makes you wonder about the thoroughness of his investigation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   IAN: The video, &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is available in some video stores, like Blockbuster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   It shows some of the gun shots. It's regrettable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that we all don't see this at the same time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   hope that those answers address your questions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, thanks for your comments.
