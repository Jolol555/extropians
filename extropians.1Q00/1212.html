<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether God exists or not is a

<EM>&gt; This is not true of the atheist position as clearly evident in recent

<P>Not at all. &quot;God&quot; exists and &quot;Zeus&quot; exists as words in the above paragraph.
<BR>
<P>THIS is the basis of all the confusion in this and similar threads. Ontological
<BR>
questions are asked as if they were NOT propositions or sentences. If,
<BR>
instead, logical questions were asked about STATEMENTS which include
<BR>
such words as terms.  Instead of asking if there were some empirical method
<BR>
by means of which such entities could be observed if in fact they exist, that
<BR>
is, turning the question into one of designing an experiment and thus asking
<BR>
empirical statements about this issue, it is necessary to formulate logical
<BR>
statements which are amenable to Truth-analysis, e.g. reductio ad absurdum.
<BR>
<P>We don't want to ask empirical questions about the existence or non-existence
<BR>
of something --we want to make STATEMENTS which assert or deny the
<BR>
existence of something, and then see if we can determine their truth, falsity
<BR>
or undecidability.  Put differently, there is no way to KNOW if &quot;God&quot; exists
<BR>
but there is a way of knowing whether &quot;God exists&quot; is true or false, once
<BR>
were decide what we mean by &quot;God&quot; [above, I took &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Zeus&quot; as
<BR>
&quot;words&quot; to falsify your statement].
<BR>
<P>There is ABSOLUTELY no way to prove by empirical induction or logical
<BR>
analysis that the word &quot;God&quot; as the subject of a sentence has or does
<BR>
not have a real objective referent. But when I state&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;IF everything in the universe, and therefore the universe itself,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the effect of at least one cause, AND IF the universe is finite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with respect to space and time, THEN the universe must be the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequent of at least one original cause which cannot be an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of anything but itself, AND cannot be a part of the uni-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verse, AND cannot be finite in space and time.&quot;
<BR>
<P>if you cannot demonstrate that the proposition itself contains contradiction,
<BR>
or if you cannot rigorously derive from this proposition two statements
<BR>
which are mutually contradictory, then the proposition is TRUE.  Only
<BR>
THEN, will I assert that the term &quot;God&quot; is equivalent to the phrase &quot;original
<BR>
cause&quot;, meaning I define the word &quot;God&quot; as &quot;Original Cause, then I can
<BR>
substitute God in the proposition and it will remain true.  Of course this
<BR>
only proves that &quot;God&quot; in this sense IS if the antecedents in the conditional
<BR>
statement are granted.
<BR>
<P>NOTE: In the above statement, &quot;the universe&quot; means &quot;the Domain of all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible human experience&quot;.
