<P>
The Nanotechnology Initiative was the subject of the discussion at the
<BR>
Foresight Nanoschmooze a couple of weeks ago.  Many of the issues posted on
<BR>
this list came up at the time (why review boards are clueless, etc.).  Much
<BR>
complaining was going on about projects being funded that have little of
<BR>
nothing to do with MNT.
<BR>
<P>I advocated that it was better to get going and flood the NSF with applications
<BR>
for actual MNT projects, than to sit around &quot;counting other people's money.&quot;
<BR>
Even if only a small number of such projects get funded, the fact is that all
<BR>
applications will have to be examined, and in the process, some amount of
<BR>
education will happen in a place that sadly needs it.  This is something each
<BR>
of us can do, although it might not seem that it is going to make much of an
<BR>
impact.  If enough people put intelligent proposals in front of the eyes of the
<BR>
reviewers, it will change the background level, even if they do not consciously
<BR>
notice it.
