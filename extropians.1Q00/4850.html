<P>It's not that patents are bad per se, but that our framework for dealing
<BR>
with them is bad.
<BR>
<P>For starters, a major culprit is the USPTO. Their framework gives patent
<BR>
examiners a financial incentive for passing patents, regardless of merit;
<BR>
they seem incapable of discerning even trivial prior art in software
<BR>
and business practice patent applications, for example. (As witness the
<BR>
patent on &quot;windowing&quot; as a Y2K solution that they granted last year --
<BR>
a technique in wide use since the mid-seventies!)
<BR>
<P>A lot of the patents they grant are, incidentally, invalid in the rest
<BR>
of the world: partly due to procedural differences, but also because
<BR>
they grant patents on things that elsewhere in the world simply aren't
<BR>
patentable. Like fundamental algorithms. 
<BR>
<P>A second problem is the duration of patents. Twenty years, or seventeen,
<BR>
may have been right early in the 20th century, but in terms of the
<BR>
information economy it's equivalent to granting patents that last for
<BR>
more than a century; the pace of change is ridiculously fast.
<BR>
<P>When you put &quot;allow over-broad patents on trivial or obvious applications&quot;
<BR>
together with &quot;excessive duration&quot; and &quot;don't bother checking the prior
<BR>
art properly&quot; you get a horrible gridlock. Instead of protecting inventors
<BR>
and enabling them to reap the rewards of their work, you end up with a
<BR>
system that forces inventors to wade through a mire of litigation, prevents
<BR>
people from making free use of obvious techniques, and promotes an arms
<BR>
race among company patent lawyers. This is a _distraction_ from invention
<BR>
and innovation, not an encouragement.
<BR>
<P>At the very least, Bezos has a point -- cut the duration of patents in the 
<BR>
business and software fields, allow public review and challenge before 
<BR>
finalizing them. I'd also like to see some mechanism that would allow
<BR>
non-commercial or non-profit-making entities to use patented software
<BR>
developments without encumbrance, as long as there is no potential for
<BR>
infringing on the patent holder's profit-potential --  a &quot;public good&quot;
<BR>
clause equivalent to the &quot;fair use&quot; get-out in copyright law. But whatever
<BR>
the remedy, the diagnosis stands: the current patent system is broken
<BR>
and needs fixing.
