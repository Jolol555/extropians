<EM>&gt; &gt; I read how in the U.S. Marine Corps the drill instructors call the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obese recruits 'baby whales' and at the end of the 13 weeks these trainees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have lost weight and toned up quite alot due to the loving attention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their instructors in making sure they get enough exercise and don't overeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ;)  Now, we have overweight yuppies paying former drill instructors good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money to give them the sort of ferociously loving attention most nineteen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; year-olds dread.  But of course it is not really the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I was in Basic Training (Army), it was common for obese individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lose 40 pounds in 8 weeks and you couldn't help but to gain lean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; muscle mass.  I went in at 150-lbs and came out at 135-lbs despite gaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some lean mass, and I wasn't obese by any means.  My body fat was easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;10% by the time I left.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I went into the Air Force, I was already a pretty serious weight lifter, so
<BR>
my weight was over the max limits, even though I had low fat levels (the USAF has
<BR>
the lowest maximums of all services, they want you to look good in a suit,
<BR>
fighting ability be damned). I sweated and dieted till I squeezed my weight down
<BR>
to 183 before basic, then I lost 16 more pounds in basic to the point I was
<BR>
digesting my innards even though I was eating three helpings at every meal...
<BR>
<P>There were guys who had somehow gotten into basic in an overweight state, and they
<BR>
got put into the 'fat boy squad'. They were the guys running back and forth
<BR>
stopping traffic, etc. as the unit was marching across base to various activities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All it took was heavy exercise every day and a regulated diet (Army food,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while mediocre in flavor and texture, *is* designed to be quite healthy).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The results are a lot more lasting too, because it tends to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; habitual behavior modification.  The point being that it is a lifestyle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change, not a &quot;something I do for two hours on four days a week&quot;, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why yuppie DIs are probably a waste of money.
</EM><BR>
<P>It might be a good camp for a few weeks though....locate the camp in the
<BR>
carribean, make it co-ed....
