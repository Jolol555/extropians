<EM>&gt;Just time for a brief response.  I would never say &quot;I believe the Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will rise tomorrow.&quot;  I would prefer &quot;I EXPECT&quot; the sun to rise tomorrow&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is a very different proposition. Or, to probe a little deeper, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might say &quot;IF the sun doesn't rise tomorrow, THEN our formulations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the Mechanics of Planetary Motion, or the Psychophysiology of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Human Perception, or both, are either incomplete or gravely flawed.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you would be incredibly wrong.  Any ten year old could tell you that
<BR>
the sun does *not* rise; had you said this a millenium ago (when people
<BR>
commonly *believed* it to be true) your 'expectation' would have been
<BR>
assumed correct.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on topic (semantics it must be...): the terms &quot;expect&quot; and &quot;believe&quot;
<BR>
both refer to a realm of knowledge that is not objectively known, but
<BR>
assumed.  &quot;Expect&quot; seems stronger, but it is not uncommon to hear Joe
<BR>
Religion say &quot;I expect the coming of Christ by year X,&quot; or Jane Engineer
<BR>
say &quot;I believe nanotechnology will be mainstream by Y.&quot;  I think Lee Daniel
<BR>
Crocker was spot-on in his definition of a &quot;rational belief;&quot; truly, the
<BR>
only things one can know absolutely are the things of the past...things
<BR>
that have happened already.  I expect that I will live at least one more
<BR>
day, I believe I will live at least ten more --these are rational beliefs
<BR>
and expectations.  I also believe that I will live to be at least 100 years
<BR>
old --still possible (even probable), but it is more of a guess than a
<BR>
rational belief\expectation.  Believing that I will live to see 1000 years
<BR>
old is irrational --it *may* happen, but looking at the technologies we
<BR>
possess today, and guessing at the breakthroughs in the next century, it
<BR>
would be just a belief...an irrational one at that.  Not enough data to say
<BR>
it with any assurance.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why Atheism is a rational belief...there is absolutely no hard
<BR>
evidence to prove that there is a God (and admittedly, not a lot to prove
<BR>
that there isn't) and so I believe that unless I am faced with some
<BR>
irrefutable proof otherwise, I will continue to believe --strongly-- that
<BR>
there is no God.  Just because I am letting a .00001% (or less) possibility
<BR>
in does not mean that I should call myself Agnostic any more than should a
<BR>
fundamental Christian with the same allowance for no God.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read my initial post again this evening, I saw that I may have come
<BR>
across a bit harder than I initially intended; I do not *hate* any
<BR>
agnostics (or anyone, for that matter) but simply question the validity of
<BR>
their belief system on such a core matter.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's start thinking forward...
