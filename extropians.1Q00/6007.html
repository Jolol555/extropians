</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If producers give away excess capacity below cost, it lowers the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;margin on the grain that they do sell for a profit, sometimes forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;them out of the market.  The short-term effect may be beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(recovering expenses), but the glut of too cheap grain creates a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;negative long-term effect on overall production because it decreases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;effective market size from a producers standpoint.  If the world worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your way, the producers would quickly sink into unprofitability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would shut down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So its just like OPEC.  They are destroying produce to artificially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;inflate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the price.  Perhaps this indicates that there are too many grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;producers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and that society (and the grain market) would be better off if some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; *did* shut down?  I realize that probably wouldn't go over too well for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; those producers that had to do the shutting down.  But in general might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; not be better than the collosal waste that current practice creates?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The thing is, Zero, that in an economy the size of ours (which a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;person cannot totally appreciate), a few million pounds of grain is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sort of waste you will get merely because the system that is already in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;place to discourage farmers from planting too much might be off on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;estimates by a fraction of a percent, or if the estimated rainfall is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;off by a few percent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;A good comparison is to compare the grain production of the US with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wood consumption of building a house. Most contractors and architects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will budget in at least 10-20% overage for wood that is waste cuttings:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its those ends of short wood that are useless, or wood that arrives with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;splits, knots, warps, theft, etc..  Using the current wastage of the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;grain market, which deals with forces of nature that are far harder to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;estimate for and control than a supply of well cut wood, the contractors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would have to improve their efficiency by a factor of two to four to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as good and efficient with their wood.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seems to make sense.  As much as I *hate* waste, I cannot completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate it from my own life.  I don't suppose I can blame contractors or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farmers for having the same problem.  Do you know how much grain is dumped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on average per year?  And what percentage that is of total US production?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know the specific data for specific crops or stages of
<BR>
distribution, but I've heard that of all food produced in the US, almost
<BR>
1/3 is lost between pests in the field and in storage, rotting, market
<BR>
fluctuations, trimmage, overpreparation, etc. between the field to the
<BR>
dinner table. Considering how perishable an item food is, thats really
<BR>
not that bad. Used to be as much as 2/3, and still is in most parts of
<BR>
the world.
