<P>I'm pretty sure this is wrong, since time of ingestion correlates with the

spontaneous miscarriage is averted, since morphogenesis follows a time

table; hmmm...) 
<BR>
<P>When this interpretation also occurred to me many years ago, I realised
<BR>
that if it were true, Catholics and other godbotherers of a certain kind
<BR>
might be *morally obliged to take thalidomide whenever the chances of
<BR>
pregnancy arose, to ensure no premature loss of immortal baptisable souls!
<BR>
The argument here is that if a foetus aborts, it presumably has no chance
<BR>
to benefit from the sacraments God has provided as the pathway into
<BR>
salvation, poor little things. It's not true that `every sperm is sacred'
<BR>
in theology, but every embryo certainly is. So, just as all hitech means of
<BR>
care must be used`to keep alive premmies and very old suffering people, so
<BR>
too, I reckon, Catholics and their thinkalikes must be obliged to take
<BR>
drugs that prevent `spontaneous' abortions. True, these might be regarded
<BR>
as part of the kindly plan of the Lord, but then so must be any infection
<BR>
or life-threatening physical defect that can be fixed by antibiotics or
<BR>
surgery, yet these are *required* of the faithful. So I imagined a future
<BR>
in which the religious were obliged to give birth to every possible
<BR>
deformed and mutant offspring, sapping their resources and driving out the
<BR>
last few intelligent members. It was a cruel and nasty fantasy, but then so
<BR>
was the system of `thought' that gave rise to it...
