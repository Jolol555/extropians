<EM>&gt; This is not as much as a &quot;Duh!&quot; as you think.  It is was currently
</EM><BR>
believed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that DNA defines an animal's appearance and much of its personality.
</EM><BR>
These
<BR>
<EM>&gt; clones had identical DNA and different egg cells.  The egg cells were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought to be empty containers to hold the DNA.  Now that the animals look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and act different, it appears that DNA is not the end-all blueprint that
</EM><BR>
we
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thought it was.  Apparently, much of the animals definition comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-DNA sources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This throws much of our assumptions about genetics out the window.  It
</EM><BR>
means
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that characteristics of children come from the parents via other
</EM><BR>
mechanisms
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in addition to DNA.  It means that a complete mapping of human DNA genome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still won't give us complete control over a child's characteristics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scanning fetal DNA won't be able to detect all birth defects, or even all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; birth defects inherited from the parents.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be very interested in details regarding the differences in the
<BR>
appearance and behavior of the cloned animal since this is the first I have
<BR>
heard of it. In previous experiements with genetically duplicate colonies of
<BR>
mice they found some were right handed other left handed. However, it would
<BR>
seem to me that it &quot;throws out&quot; the assumptions. More over, I would be
<BR>
hesitant is drawing conclusion regarding heritable behavior between animals
<BR>
and humans. My belief is that what distinguishes us from animals is the lack
<BR>
of genetically inheriated behavior. Just look at  the very wide variations
<BR>
of behavior among humans, then compare that with a chimp. Sure there are
<BR>
differences among troops of chimps, but most revolve the very narrow range
<BR>
of eating patterns.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a major problem for genetics and biology.  We have to develop an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension to genetics that track trait inheritance outside of DNA.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also is a problem for cloning replacement organs.  What if we get an exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA match, and the organs are still rejected by the body as being alien?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --
</EM><BR>
Has research begun to reveal a possible problem here? Yes, environment has
<BR>
long been know to contribute to the final out come, but in this case it
<BR>
would should be easy to control.
