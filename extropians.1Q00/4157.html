<P><EM>&gt; ...existence is literally everything that exists...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm afraid this is just too circular to be informative. This is what is
<BR>
bound to happen when you try to turn a concept into an axiom, and
<BR>
you end by saying something like &quot;existence is exactly what it is and
<BR>
not something else&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's possible that some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these things could exist in a non-spatial way.
</EM><BR>
<P>When you use an undefined term as a verb in the subjunctive mood,
<BR>
EVERYTHING is possible. The noun &quot;Existence&quot; and the infinitive
<BR>
&quot;to exist&quot; are entirely different things. As in, &quot;esse est percipi&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The approach I personally prefer is to treat things as &quot;virtual objects&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which which &quot;exist&quot; only in terms of their relations with each other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That is, they are completely specified by their relationships. To have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relationships is to exist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be is to be something.  To be is to have an identity, or to be is to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an identity.  To be aware of something, on whatever level, is to enter into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a relationship with it.  Indentification, to whatever degree, is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relational process.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why can't we stick to the action of existing and deal with that? Why do
<BR>
you insist on simultaneously confronting the action of knowing? It is not
<BR>
that they lack association, it is that we avoid confusion by taking things
<BR>
one at a time.
<BR>
<P>To sum up my position: [1] To be is to relate;  [2] Existence is relation-
<BR>
ality and existing is to be a term in one or more relations; [3] That which
<BR>
exists does so as a member of an ordered pair or n-tuple insofar as they
<BR>
instantiate or concretize a relation.
<BR>
<P>Platonically, the Forms are Relations; objects exist precisely insofar as they
<BR>
participate in the actualization of a Form.
<BR>
<P>Once this is out of the way, one can move forward to epistemology by
<BR>
postulating that that relations and their relata are that which is intelligible
<BR>
within a perceptual field. I do not need a knowing subject because knowing
<BR>
is a relationship between two relata; &quot;subjectivity&quot; and &quot;objectivity&quot; are
<BR>
uselessly unintelligible.  There is simply knowledge and known co-existing
<BR>
in an epistemological field which you can call &quot;consciousness&quot; or, like
<BR>
Maxwell's mathematical electromagnetic field, call it nothing at all. The
<BR>
relation that is actualized, the important thing, is &quot;knowing&quot;.
