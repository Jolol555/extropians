<P>
Uh oh, too bad I'm not an american citizen.
<BR>
<P>But this whole issue concerns us all who defend
<BR>
civil liberties, and not just of us who are interested
<BR>
in altered states of consciousness.
<BR>
<P>I keep wondering why the US, keeps becoming
<BR>
more and more restrictive and intolerant as the time
<BR>
passes, I remember that as a child and as a teenager
<BR>
I admired this country because it was a country where
<BR>
you suposedly were free, and had the chance to improve
<BR>
your life quality as well.
<BR>
<P>Then I started to notice as I started travelling to the us
<BR>
that it wasn't as free as I thought and I began to feel
<BR>
disappointed, specially when I noticed that the US
<BR>
goverment (not the citizens) likes to manipulate things
<BR>
to justify whatever they want to do.
<BR>
<P>Like this drug war, it is ridiculous that while the media
<BR>
and goverment tells us drugs are evil, that they turn
<BR>
normal people into criminals, and ruin your life,
<BR>
and they keep talking and talking what are they going to
<BR>
do to stop drug traffic and protect the children, drugs
<BR>
become more readily available, the prices get lower
<BR>
and the quality higher, not only that, but if you've read
<BR>
excellent books like acid dreams you'll know that US
<BR>
goverment did experiments with lsd and other mind
<BR>
altering substances, without the consent of people
<BR>
while searching for the perfect mind controling substance.
<BR>
<P>And not only that, if you talk with vietnam veterans
<BR>
(what I've done) they'll tell you that airplanes with
<BR>
tons and tons of drugs appeared on a regular basis
<BR>
so soldiers could be happy, they also gave them
<BR>
amphetamines to be more agressive and could
<BR>
endure more.
<BR>
<P>So my theory is that this drug war, is just a tool
<BR>
of control a silent weapon to rob people of their
<BR>
liberties, a tool to justify racism (most of drug
<BR>
related incarcerations, happen in poor black
<BR>
districts) it is also used to justify US intervention
<BR>
in foreign lands (like communisn was used before)
<BR>
and I don't doubt it'll be also a tool to gradually
<BR>
erode our civil rights (because unfortunately
<BR>
most of what the US goverment decides
<BR>
affects things worldwide)
<BR>
<P>I've always thought that the more restrictive a
<BR>
goverment is with their citizens, the more
<BR>
it hinders progress, civilization and economic
<BR>
development, I suppose the founding fathers
<BR>
thought this as well and that's why the
<BR>
constitution defends so vehemently civil rights
<BR>
of people, so it is very sad that, more restrictive
<BR>
policies are being enacted.
<BR>
<P>However fortunately it is the goverment who wants
<BR>
to do this, not the average citizen, and although the
<BR>
majory is willing to trade their freedom for
<BR>
&quot;security&quot; most people is becoming aware of this
<BR>
with the passage of time, and fertile positive meme
<BR>
petri dishes (like this list) keep informing people, so
<BR>
it is very probable that this advance towards restriction
<BR>
and intolerance can be stopped, and that parties like
<BR>
the libertarian are getting more powerful (although
<BR>
I still believe no single party should have all the power)
<BR>
<P>any comments?
