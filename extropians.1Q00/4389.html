Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The general objective of this study was to examine the role of mitochondria
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the aging process. Two alternative hypotheses were tested: (i) that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;overexpression of Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) in the mitochondria of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila melanogaster would slow the accrual of oxidative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;damage and prolong survival or (ii) that there is an evolved optimum level of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;superoxide anion radical, such that overexpression of Mn SOD would have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;deleterious or neutral effects. Microinjection and mobilization of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transgene, which contained a 9-kb genomic sequence encoding Mn SOD, produced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 experimental lines overexpressing Mn SOD by 5-116% relative to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;parental y w strain. Comparisons between these lines and control lines
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;containing inserted vector sequences alone indicated that the mean
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity of the experimental lines was decreased by 4-5%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relative to controls. There were no compensatory changes in the metabolic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate, level of physical activity, or the levels of other antioxidants, namely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cu-Zn SOD, catalase, and glutathione. There were no differences between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups in rates of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide release, protein oxidative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;damage, or resistance to 100% oxygen or starvation conditions. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;experimental lines had a marginally increased resistance to moderate heat
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stress. These results are consistent with the existence of an optimum level
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Mn SOD activity which minimizes oxidative stress. The naturally evolved
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;level of Mn SOD activity in Drosophila appears to be near
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the optimum required under normal conditions, although the optimum may be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shifted to a higher level under more stressful conditions. Copyright 1999

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxidative stress-induced damage is a major causal factor leading to the loss
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of function characteristic of the aging process. Various antioxidant defenses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are marshalled by the organism so as to combat this oxidative damage and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;delay the onset of senscence. CuZnSOD is one of the major antioxidant enzymes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and has been shown to play an important role in the extended
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity of Drosophila melanogaster.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although assays exist with which to measure the CuZnSOD RNA prevalence and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enzyme activity, there existed no antibodies that permitted the measurement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the actual amount of Drosophila enzyme protein present.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of such a tool would enhance our ability to understand mechanisms
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of antioxidant gene expression in this organism. We have developed a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polyclonal antibody against synthetic SOD peptides that is specific for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila CuZnSOD as shown by Western blots. It is very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sensitive when tested against native Drosophila CuZnSOD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protein. Its use in our experimental system confirms the prior RNA and enzyme
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;activity measurements that indicate that our genetically selected long-lived
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;strain has significantly higher levels of CuZnSOD protein than does the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate control strain.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reactive oxygen (RO) has been identified as an important effector in ageing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and lifespan determination. The specific cell types, however, in which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidative damage acts to limit lifespan of the whole organism have not been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;explicitly identified. The association between mutations in the gene encoding
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the oxygen radical metabolizing enzyme CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;loss of motorneurons in the brain and spinal cord that occurs in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;life-shortening paralytic disease, Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(FALS; ref. 4), suggests that chronic and unrepaired oxidative damage
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occurring specifically in motor neurons could be a critical causative factor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in ageing. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila which express human SOD1 specifically in adult
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;motorneurons. We show that overexpression of a single gene, SOD1, in a single
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cell type, the motorneuron, extends normal lifespan by up to 40% and rescues
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the lifespan of a short-lived Sod null mutant. Elevated resistance to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidative stress suggests that the lifespan extension observed in these flies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is due to enhanced RO metabolism. These results show that SOD activity in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;motorneurons is an important factor in ageing and lifespan determination in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila.
