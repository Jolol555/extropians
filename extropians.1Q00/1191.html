<EM>&gt; decriminalization of drugs.  I just want to see the &quot;war&quot; be toned down to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensible level.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I hear this sentiment expressed fairly frequently.  Allow me to chime
<BR>
in with some data that might change your mind.
<BR>
<P>Though the regulatory story is complex, prior to the late 19th
<BR>
century, some of the most super-vilifed drugs of today were fairly
<BR>
readily available to most Americans.  Cocaine and various opiates,
<BR>
including heroin and morphine, were not hard to obtain -- certainly no
<BR>
harder to obtain than, say, valium is today.  In certain locales and
<BR>
at certain times they were easier to obtain; you simply went to the
<BR>
druggist and bought them.  Certain patent medicines available through
<BR>
the mail without a prescription contained either, primarily depending
<BR>
on whether they were meant as analgesics or &quot;tonics&quot;.  Smokable hemp
<BR>
(marijuana) was also widely used, and was, as far as I can tell,
<BR>
completely decontrolled everywhere throughout the United States for a
<BR>
century or so at least.
<BR>
<P>As far as I can tell, the widespread arrival of opium was what changed
<BR>
this picture somewhat.  Fairly racist attitudes toward Chinese opium
<BR>
smokers fueled a public hysteria which led, by steps, to the
<BR>
nightmarish situation that pertains today.
<BR>
<P>Despite the relatively laissez-faire attitude of the state and federal
<BR>
governments in the U.S. for a century or so, almost all commentators
<BR>
at the time agreed that the number one drug problem was with
<BR>
*alcoholic beverages*.  A little historical investigation will
<BR>
eliminate the doubt about this, but allow me to adduce the Prohibition
<BR>
period as evidence.  Alcoholic beverages' special combination of ready
<BR>
availability, acute and short-term effects and long-term addictive
<BR>
properties made it particularly ruinous to a large number of people
<BR>
and undermined public health in a manner which no other drug came
<BR>
close to doing, except perhaps smokable tobacco.
<BR>
<P>This situation is identical *today*!  Even government studies show the
<BR>
use and abuse of alcohol *alone* (and especially in combination with
<BR>
tobacco) takes a much greater toll on the public health than all other
<BR>
illegal drug abuse combined does.  This includes accounting for
<BR>
short-term effects, long-term effects and accidents.  I refer you to
<BR>
this study by the National Institute of Health in re: alcohol and
<BR>
illegal drugs specifically:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.nida.nih.gov/EconomicCosts/Index.html">http://www.nida.nih.gov/EconomicCosts/Index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Bear in mind that this is a government funded study which might be
<BR>
biased in favor of showing negative effects of illegal drugs, and it
<BR>
still shows alcohol as much worse of a problem than all other illegal
<BR>
drugs combined.
<BR>
<P>Prohibition against certain drugs has not changed the situation.
<BR>
Alcohol and tobacco claim far more lives than other drugs in America,
<BR>
just as they always have done.  If anything, drug prohibition seems to
<BR>
have worsened the situation by creating an illicit appeal to illegal
<BR>
drugs and by imposing huge social costs in terms of imprisonment and
<BR>
so on.
<BR>
<P>So please bear in mind that if you support the drug war on
<BR>
recreational drugs, then to be logically consistent you ought to
<BR>
support prohibiting alcohol and tobacco.
<BR>
<P>Any other position is hypocritical.  Either alcohol and tobacco, our
<BR>
most dangerous drugs, ought to be banned too or none of them should be
<BR>
banned.
<BR>
<P>There can be no statistical doubt that alcohol and tobacco do far more
<BR>
harm than the illegal drugs.  In fact, certain illegal drugs, such as
<BR>
LSD, statistically do no harm to the public health, yet carry huge
<BR>
penalties.
<BR>
<P>It is for this reason I support total drug legalization.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James Wetterau
