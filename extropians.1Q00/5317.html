<P>Whoa!  You've got stuff in there I did not freaking write!!!

<BR>
<P>was from Robert Owen -- not me.  I was actually questioning this statement
<BR>
of his.  To dovetail it in my comments makes me look blatantly incoherent.
<BR>
(Not that I'm never guilty of blatant incoherence, but I plead innocence in
<BR>
this particular instance.:)
<BR>
<P>It also appears Robert and I are closer on our views of this than I
<BR>
originally thought...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robert, imperialism in the classic sense may be gone, but that is because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's too expensive and make's for poor public relations!  We now live in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; age of neo-colonialism.  It is at least superficially a more acceptable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of the old ways of doing things.  Conquered territories are
</EM><BR>
occupied
<BR>
<EM>&gt; now by our corporate powers that bind and control (and for some mutual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit) our third world neighbors.  We control them, and in turn their
</EM><BR>
own
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ruling elite bind the common people of their nation's to supply us with
</EM><BR>
what
<BR>
<EM>&gt; we want from them.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Neo-colonialism&quot; has problems here as a contrast to imperialism.
<BR>
Imperialism always has rested on influence and is generally when one nation
<BR>
controls another.  Paradigmatic cases of it are the British and Roman
<BR>
Empires.  However, even though these two nations managed to occupy a lot of
<BR>
territory, one must also remember a lot of their control was mediated by
<BR>
local authorities.  In fact, even for bona fide provinces of Rome, the local
<BR>
governor and local elites did much of the ruling.  Granted, in any fight
<BR>
between Rome and the Provinces, Rome usually won.  (Not so later on when
<BR>
emperors rose from provincial stock and used their resources at the edge of
<BR>
the Empire to dominate Rome.)  Britain, likewise, used the Indian elite and
<BR>
even Indian soldiers to control India (as well as to fight elsewhere for the
<BR>
British Empire).
<BR>
<P>True colonialism implies not just control but populating the dominated
<BR>
regions.  Empires usually do this to maintain control, just as Romans
<BR>
populated Britain and Palestine with their own stock.  The Greeks before
<BR>
them did likewise.  Colonialism is merely a tool of imperialism.  But, in a
<BR>
sense, colonialism at its extreme would lead to the empire not existing.
<BR>
Why?  Well, if the controlled areas become so much like the controllers,
<BR>
then we would have a unified nation, not a conglomeration of nations which
<BR>
is the hallmark of empire.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Neo-colonialism&quot; could be viewed as just another tool.  In fact, long
<BR>
before the term was invented, the British Empire was spreading through the
<BR>
Niger River region via business and missionary influences.  See Michael
<BR>
Doyle's excellent work _Empires_ for more on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our global corporate CEO's are the new conquering Ceasers who write their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of the 'Gallic Wars' as business self-help manuals!  And they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too hailed as great defenders of their respective way of life.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, John's rhetoric is getting ahead of him.  Yeah, that sounds cute, but
<BR>
truth be told, global corporations play boths sides of the game.  Nor do I
<BR>
think of CEOs as &quot;the new conquering Ceasers[sic]...&quot;  There are some
<BR>
unscrupulous businesspeople out there, but a Ceasar is not so petty and
<BR>
small.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And the 'barbarian hordes' of our day would be India and China who want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desperately the technological and economic type of power we possess.  As
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ancient Romans did, we educate and employ them but they often return to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own people to share our ways and secrets.  Just as Rome was
</EM><BR>
partially
<BR>
<EM>&gt; bested because of 'Roman-trained enemies'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will we go the same way?  Where does the knife-twisting come from in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age?  Our own government, ourselves?
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem here is that John is taking the metaphor too far.  Granted,
<BR>
there are parallels between US behavior and that of many other empires, but
<BR>
it's not just another production of the great &quot;Tragedy of Empire.&quot;  China,
<BR>
e.g., is an empire in its own right.  It controls Tibet and has a sphere of
<BR>
influence on its periphery.  It's by no means a disorganized horde.  (I'm
<BR>
not about to glaze over taking about the Yellow Peril.  I'm just recognizing
<BR>
that China is organized and has its own agenda apart from reacting to US
<BR>
policy.)
<BR>
<P>India hardly is threatening the US.  It's one of the disturbing features of
<BR>
US foreign policy that it is not until this year that an American President
<BR>
is seriously thinking of having good relations with the world's most
<BR>
populated democracy.
