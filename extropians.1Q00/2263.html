<P><EM>&gt;I spent several hours studying the earlier Waco video a few months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree that, based on these photographs, a structure of some sort is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;present in the courtyard on the day of the fire, which was not there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;few days ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However I question whether this would be a &quot;sniper's nest&quot; for a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons.  The main one is that this does not seem to be a very reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position for a sniper to hide.  It is in the courtyard, surrounded on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;three sides by buildings occupied by the people he would be sniping at.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It does not appear to be a very defensible position, as he could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bullets coming at him from three directions.  Further, he would himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be firing at virtually point-blank range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Sniping&quot; usually connotes a somewhat long-distance firing activity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Placing your &quot;nest&quot; in the middle of the enemy's courtyard, mere yards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the walls, just seems utterly absurd.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Your analysis seems reasonable on its face. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We should note that the tank's penetration around
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the rear of the gym, with supplemental machinegun
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fire, was obviously providing cover for the close-in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sniper(s). The thermal flashes in the courtyard are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very pronounced, and can be broken down into rapid 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fire of machine guns. The vast majority of expert 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis says they are gun shots, and the initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;counter explanation of sunlight reflections has 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been invalidated and abandoned by the FBI. Now 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the FBI says (1) that FLIR can't pick up gun 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shots and (2) the flashes are glitches on the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tape. (1) is false, &quot;Waco: A New Revelation&quot; shows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;FLIR tape of a gun fight where gun shots are visible
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the exact same way seen at Waco. (2) is improbable,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;since the locations of flashes over time remain fixed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with respect to the ground, even as the camera changes 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it's location. In short, flash locations are not random.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shots would be fired so close is odd, but I believe 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the evidence indicates that they were. There must be a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reason why they needed to get so close, maybe we'll 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;figure it out. As for the snipers nest. I got word 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from one of the lawyers that the tank punched the wall 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;out at that point (not visible on the FLIR) and a sniper 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or snipers used the punched-out-wall as a makeshift hide.
