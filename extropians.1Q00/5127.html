<P>
EvMick, since you are such a cool guy, and I happen to have a
<BR>
very tall stack of books on thermodynamics on my desk, floor,
<BR>
in my bookcase, etc. (due to the research on Matrioshka Brains),
<BR>
I'll take a stab at your question...
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All power sources that I'm familar with go from hot to cold.
</EM><BR>
<P>They must do this.  The second law of thermodynamics requires it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By that I mean 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the power source(gasoline, diesel, electric, charcoal, firewood, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever) is concentrated.  Using this concentrated heat source and  some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type of mechanism a tempetrure differential is produced with the ambient.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, and the efficiency is commonly expressed as delta(change-in)-T/T,
<BR>
or (T2 - T1)/T2.  The reference on my desk is Nanomedicine, Section 6.3.1,
<BR>
but it is in all thermodynamics texts.  As Robert points out, going from
<BR>
the human body (310K) to the periphery (307K) {(310-307)/310)} yields a
<BR>
1% efficiency.  Not very good.  If you want more energy (from more efficient
<BR>
conversion) for the nanobots, you are going to have to &quot;burn&quot; glucose at 600K.
<BR>
That gives you ((600-310)/600) or around 48%.  Better than *most* common
<BR>
power sources (nuclear reactors, coal plants, engines, etc.) today.
<BR>
<P>I'll offer a point of trivia, that since the differential in temperature
<BR>
should be greater when you are driving in Minnesota, than when you are
<BR>
in Florida (lower outside temp), in theory you should get slightly better
<BR>
gas mileage in those Northern climes. [Caveat, the efficiency may be
<BR>
masked by many other factors that I'm unaware of.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My truck has a radiator, electric company generators have cooling towers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc.  There must be a tempeture differential for power to be produced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The limit for power conversions on Earth is how hot you can make
<BR>
the power carrier (burning).  If your engine were constructed out of
<BR>
titanium carbide, it might have an operating temperature of around 2400K,
<BR>
it would then sink the waste heat into the environment at 294K.  That
<BR>
would yield an efficiency of (2400-294)/2400 or 88%.  The reason that
<BR>
diesel engines are more efficient than gas engines is that they
<BR>
burn slighly hotter, and therefore have better efficiency.  But since
<BR>
iron has an operating temperature only up to 1400-1500 degrees K
<BR>
(before it starts getting soft), that makes your efficiency much lower
<BR>
than if you had a ceramic (e.g. titanium carbide) engine.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure you could browse the web and find the difference in operating
<BR>
temperatures between diesel and gas engines that determines the slight
<BR>
differences in efficiency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How about if we go about it backwards?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How much &quot;Coldth&quot; can be concentrated in a mobile source?  Is a solid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen brick possible?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha, yes, of course, solid N2 bricks have a temperature of ~60K.  And
<BR>
if you were delivering the heat of your engine to a solid N2 brick
<BR>
you would of course have higher conversion efficiency (more MPG).
<BR>
<P>The problem is that creating something cooled *below* the ambient
<BR>
heat sink temperature (~294K) is very expensive.  At least one
<BR>
figure I've read is that it costs you ~3x as much to create the
<BR>
cold &quot;sink&quot; as you would get back from using it.  So you would have
<BR>
to burn 3x as much petrol to produce N2 bricks to fill your radiator
<BR>
as you would get back by using that as the heat sink.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assume it is (or something like it).....could usable amounts of electricity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be developed using &quot;thermocouple technology&quot;?  Or merely by letting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen boil off and powering &quot;steam&quot; engines?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, the principles are no different from those at higher temperatures.
<BR>
The problem is that the laws of thermodynamics kill you in attempting
<BR>
to create a sink that is cold.  Now if you were running your truck around
<BR>
on Neptune, you would most likely have liquid nitrogen circulating between
<BR>
the engine and the radiator.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this instance the ambient temp. of the atmosphere would heat the nitrogen 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brick causing (hopefully) a useful pressure differential.  The only exhaust 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be nitrogen....chilly nitrogen...no nitrogen dioxides even...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  You could get the energy for free by mining frozen LN2, focusing
<BR>
the (weak) sun on it and letting it boil off powering your &quot;steam&quot; generator.
<BR>
However, the efficiency would be much lower.  LN2 boils at 77K.  So
<BR>
the efficiency of converting solid nitrogen blocks to nitrogen &quot;steam&quot;
<BR>
is only (77-63)/77 or 18%.  Not very good.  The net result, you are
<BR>
going to have to shovel a lot more N2 bricks into your boiler than
<BR>
you pump diesel fuel into your tanks currently to go the same
<BR>
distance.  Do you care?  Depends on the price you have to pay the
<BR>
LN2 brick miners. You really want to run your truck inside the orbit
<BR>
of Venus, using a radiator fluid that has the greatest differential
<BR>
between the melting point of the solid and the boiling point of the
<BR>
liquid.  And, believe it or not, I have no idea what this substance
<BR>
would be....  I suspect, since it is commonly used in proposed nuclear
<BR>
reactors that liquid sodium is good (1156 BP, and 370K MP).  So you
<BR>
could get (~68%) in this system. Note that you can change the MP and BP
<BR>
by applying pressure to the system, but that makes it much to complex
<BR>
to discuss here.
<BR>
<P>Note that the purpose of the radiator fluid is to allow you to &quot;burn&quot;
<BR>
your engine as hot as possible without allowing a melt-down.  But
<BR>
you tend to be constrained by the properties of the fluid.  Since
<BR>
cars and trucks use water, you are always running at temperatures
<BR>
over the boiling point.  You could run the engines somewhat hotter,
<BR>
but it would require a more pressurized system (or a different coolant).
<BR>
More pressurized systems are more expensive, think metal (hydraulic)
<BR>
coolant pipes rather than rubber hoses.  And if one bursts, oh boy....
<BR>
<P>It cheers my heart to hear you thinkin about this stuff.  Clever
<BR>
people, thinkin about everyday stuff and askin why?  Thats what
<BR>
what made science what it is today and gave us our present
<BR>
technological ramp and will make things more interesting in
<BR>
the future as the phase space for creativity expands.
