<P>Thermodynamics.  Not just a good idea, its the second law.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My truck has a radiator, electric company generators have cooling towers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc.  There must be a tempeture differential for power to be produced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about if we go about it backwards?
</EM><BR>
<P>Cant go that way, any more than you can pick up speed coasting
<BR>
uphill outta gear in that rig you're driving.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How much &quot;Coldth&quot; can be concentrated in a mobile source?  Is a solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen brick possible?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure it is.  Sounds like an expensive way to dump heat, but it would
<BR>
work great, give you high efficiency.  But why make nitrogen bricks
<BR>
when you can dump the heat directly into the air with your radiator?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this instance the ambient temp. of the atmosphere would heat the nitrogen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brick causing (hopefully) a useful pressure differential.  The only exhaust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be nitrogen....chilly nitrogen...no nitrogen dioxides even...
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger all that.  EvMick, I can tell from your posts that you are a
<BR>
bright chap.  You should borrow or buy yourself a book on thermo-
<BR>
dynamics for engineering students.  Thermodynamics is one field that
<BR>
makes total sense.  You dont even need advanced math training to
<BR>
grok it.  Next time you drive that diesel rig this way you can borrow
<BR>
mine.  Look up carnot cycle and carnot efficiency and it will explain
<BR>
everything you need to know.  Sounds like you have practically
<BR>
figured it all out on intuition alone, an admirable thing in itself.
<BR>
<P>Your diesel rig likely has a turbocharger that is driven by
<BR>
exhaust gas, which technically makes it a Brayton cycle with
<BR>
a verrry complicated combustion chamber.

<P>Wildwood!  That isnt all that far from my old stomping
<BR>
grounds.  Do drive carefully EvMick.  I am honored to
<BR>
have you as a friend.  spike
