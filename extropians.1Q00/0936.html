<EM>&gt; &gt;Perhaps we could analyze this problem from two angles.  One would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technical feasability.  The other is whether Right to Life groups &gt;would
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;willing to support -- financially, politically, or morally &gt;-- this
</EM><BR>
option.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paul Wakfer tried to promote this idea when he created the Prometheus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Project whose goal was to develop and implement fully reversible
</EM><BR>
suspension.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   Of course present suspension methods are NOT reversible and this will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really limit the ability to drum up public support.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cryopreservation _is_ reversible for single celled embryos, no?  I'm not
<BR>
saying this is the stage at which to do this, but it makes it seem more
<BR>
likely to be able to do this at the very early stages of development.
<BR>
<P>Also, even if it's not reversible now, it certainly seems like it would be
<BR>
technically easier to solve this problem than it would be to solve it in the
<BR>
case of adult humans.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that many women who go in for abortions would not want the baby to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be cryosuspended.  They want the potential human being (child) killed as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter of convenience.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where did I say all women who abort would want or have to do this!?!  We
<BR>
would only need a small number who would want another option -- aside from
<BR>
aborting with death for the fetus or continuing the pregnancy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course where is the father in situations like this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Non-issue, especially since in the US, where this is most likely to happen,
<BR>
the father has no legal standing in abortions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And to suspend the child would definitely raise expenses for the abortion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clinics.  I don't think they would want their high profit margins to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfered with.
</EM><BR>
<P>This doesn't matter either.  Many or most abortion clinics might not want
<BR>
this.  So what?  McDonald's probably doesn't like it when a vegan restaurant
<BR>
opens next door.  Big deal!  The point is, if enough women want this and
<BR>
it's technically feasible, then it can and might happen, regardless of what
<BR>
abortion clinics think.
<BR>
<P>But why wouldn't this be merely a high end service the abortion clinics
<BR>
could provide?  I think that might be more likely, just as when I go to the
<BR>
hair stylist, I can get the $12 haircut or the $30 shampoo and styling.
<BR>
<P>Off to work!
