<EM>&gt; Eliezer, while I applaud Eric and Open Source in general, as a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture too poor or the number of people trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneously modify the same code too large (requiring someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to interpret the spagetti that results), then open-source may not

<P>ROFL!!!!
<BR>
<P>Since no one has ever attempted to build anything big using Open Source
<BR>
methods, you can hardly claim that they have been proven to work better.
<BR>
Linux is tiny compared to most modern commercial software, both in terms of
<BR>
LOC and of total functionality.  Mozilla was only a mid-sized app by modern
<BR>
standards, and look what happened to it...
<BR>
<P>I'm with Robert on this one.  Open Source is better than the code-and-fix
<BR>
swamp that most software companies have mired themselves in, but it is
<BR>
fundamentally incompatible with any disciplined practice of software
<BR>
engineering.  Since the benifits of a modern software engineering system are
<BR>
much larger than those of open source (there are ducumented instances of
<BR>
productivity gains as large as 600-to-1, and sustained improvements of 20% -
<BR>
50% per year are commonplace), it is pretty obvious which approach should
<BR>
win out.
<BR>
<P>Fox anyone who is curious about this topic, I recommend Steve McConnel's
<BR>
&quot;Rapid Development&quot; and &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; as a good intruduction to what
<BR>
software engineering is, why we need it, and what results we can expect from
<BR>
it.
