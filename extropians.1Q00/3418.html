<EM>&gt; Sure, in principle, but then you are back to Eugene's super-gods who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reconstruct everyone from atmospheric molecule motions.  Once information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has degraded into heat, there is no practical technology which is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be able to re-create that information.  And such degradation is exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what happens in chemical reactions that increase entropy.  Distinguishable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states transform into indistinguishable states.  Macro scale information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (at least at the molecular and structural level) changes into micro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scale information (meaning heat).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if you are talking about incinerating the brain, or dissolving it in
<BR>
acid, or something equally drastic, I agree.  But the kinds of injuries that
<BR>
actually occur with any significant frequently aren't nearly that severe.
<BR>
<P>For example, a few hours of ischemic injury would leave a quiet recognizable
<BR>
brain.  You've got lots of molecules that have been degraded in some way
<BR>
(denatured proteins, etc.), but the general structure of the cells is
<BR>
preserved and most of the damaged components are pretty much where they
<BR>
started.  If you understand what healthy cells are supposed to look like,
<BR>
and you know the chemical pathways that cause the damage, restoring the
<BR>
tissue to its original state should not be a big deal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I maintain that given our current state of knowledge, we simply don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know whether there is sufficient information in frozen tissue to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reconstruct its initial state to any particular degree of precision.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  I rather suspect that our real disagreement is here.  IMO, current
<BR>
evidence adequately supports the assumption that information storage in the
<BR>
brain is not localized - i.e. that each bit is stored as part of the pattern
<BR>
of interconnections of a very large number of neurons, rather than in the
<BR>
state of some particular part of a single cell.
<BR>
<P>That means that you don't need to put every atom exactly back in its
<BR>
original position to get a successful reconstruction.  The important
<BR>
features are relatively large, highly redundant structures containing vast
<BR>
numbers of molecules.  Obliterating those structures beyond recognition will
<BR>
require far more damage than you would normally see - you'd have to drop the
<BR>
brain in a blender, or do something equally drastic.  I'm not sure how much
<BR>
natural decay it would take, but it seems obvious that we're talking about
<BR>
days or weeks rather than hours.
<BR>
<P>If, however, you believe that all of the fine structure within an individual
<BR>
cell is important, that would make the problem much more difficult.  Then
<BR>
you would have to get each molecule back to exactly its original position
<BR>
and state, so the amount of damage required to prevent reconstruction would
<BR>
be much lower.  I still think, however, that you make insufficient allowance
<BR>
for the fact that reconstruction isn't limited to just looking at the frozen
<BR>
tissue and following simple atom-shuffling algorithms.
