Well, it should be obvious that the technology of high-temperature
<BR>
methane metabolizing fuel cell units installed in every home would 1)
<BR>
save a lot of gas (non-Carnot plus electricity generation in situ
<BR>
(hence no need for long-haul transport) coupled to warm water
<BR>
generation) 2) be virtually emission free 3) eliminate brownouts 4) be
<BR>
relatively easy/cheap to develop.
<BR>
<P>The same thing applies to composite-frame motor-in-wheelhub fuel cell
<BR>
cars (Pt/Pd/Ru on carbon cloth, polymer proton membrane, methanol
<BR>
onboard reformers). Of course development costs would be higher, but
<BR>
consider the markets.
<BR>
<P>If we implemented them both the Inland Empire would be entirely
<BR>
smog-free. However, home owners do not even insulate their
<BR>
air-conditioned houses.
<BR>
<P>My suspiction is that people are unconcerned/ignorant enough not even
<BR>
to demand an analysis.

<EM> &gt; to some degree, but it ignores the problem of diminishing returns and

<EM> &gt; you should have a careful analysis of the marginal costs &amp; benefits

<EM> &gt; of each level of environmental milestones and implement each successive

<EM> &gt; level only as the economy grows enough to support those additional
