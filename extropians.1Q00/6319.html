<P>
I suspect many of you are like me in not making a big deal of most 
<BR>
public/official holidays (e.g., I spent Christmas Day a few years ago 
<BR>
setting up my first web site, after paying brief respects to Sir Isaac 
<BR>
Newton on his birthday). However, I particularly like April Fool's Day. 
<BR>
It's a wonderful opportunity to show people how easily they can be fooled, 
<BR>
how unaware they often are, and how they need to improve their critical 
<BR>
thinking skills. A few do this in a mean-spirited way, but mostly it seems 
<BR>
to take place in a humorous way.
<BR>
<P>Since I teach classes in Critical Thinking and Logic (I have one this 
<BR>
semester), I like to use examples of effective April Fool's gags as 
<BR>
examples, and even to try out on students. (Unfortunately the next class 
<BR>
isn't until April 6th this year.)
<BR>
<P>Last year, my favorite was an article in Red Herring (a business technology 
<BR>
magazine). It appeared as a substantial and entirely journalistically 
<BR>
plausible profile of a start-up company, Tidal Wave Communications, making 
<BR>
a device you wear behind your ear. It picks up your thoughts and allows you 
<BR>
to send and email by thinking. The story went on for several pages, 
<BR>
included photos of the companies principals, and photos of the product. Red 
<BR>
Herring is an excellent business tech magazine, so it was an effective way 
<BR>
to fool people, and the gag was pulled off with great skill. (I highly 
<BR>
recommend reading it. The story (without the photos is here: 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue65/news-tidalwave.html">http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue65/news-tidalwave.html</A> ) Some readers 
<BR>
were quite upset at being taken for a ride. Without any knowledge of 
<BR>
neuroscience it would be difficult for most people to catch onto this one 
<BR>
right away.
<BR>
<P>If you come across clever gags like this, I would appreciate hearing about 
<BR>
them. Fresh material for the class is always good. Maybe we should also add 
<BR>
a page to the ExI site for such things, including resources for critical 
<BR>
thinking.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
