<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As a disbeliever in patents, this article warmed my heart,

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.around.com/patent.html">http://www.around.com/patent.html</A>
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; As a hopeful inventor can someone explain to me why patents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; considered bad?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their hard won
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intellectual efforts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.  In a free capitalist society, people should profit from the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exchange of goods or services with other individuals, or any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freely entered profitable contract or dealing.  By contrast, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obtain a patent, you prevent me, via a state granted monopoly on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular implementation of an idea, from using my own intelligence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labor and industry to similarly profit.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that it is pretty difficult for the second guy to prove
<BR>
he never had any input from the first. Any moron can look at an
<BR>
invention and smack their head, saying, oh yeah I see how that works. If
<BR>
they go and start making their own without ever having actually bought
<BR>
the original device from the original inventor, are they really an
<BR>
inventor, or just a cheap shallow crook with no consideration for
<BR>
others?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is coercive, oppressive and destructive, as well as against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property. I'm having
<BR>
fun with those bozos right now on alt.anarchy. They don't understand
<BR>
that I've painted them into a paradox. They either have to acknowledge
<BR>
property rights or admit that they beleive that individuals are slaves
<BR>
to the group.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is intellectual property worth less because it springs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sometimes so easily from the creative mind?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, make all the profits you want off your legitimate intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property.  (Hint -- if your so-called property derives from a grant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the government, its legitimacy is highly questionable.  In this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, it's a government hand out.)  I make profits from my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property -- I write computer programs, and help people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrate other peoples' software into their systems.  These profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do not depend on coercing others into not doing likewise.  That's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bullies' game, not fit for free women and men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>However patent protection makes sure that EVERY user of your invention
<BR>
pays his fair share, which is not the case currently with software,
<BR>
where you have between 20-50% piracy rates. Those who pay for software
<BR>
licenses wind up paying for the pirates, feel gyped, and are more likely
<BR>
to commit piracy themselves as a result. They know they are getting
<BR>
shafted, but not by who they think they are...
