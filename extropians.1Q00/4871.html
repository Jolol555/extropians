<P><EM>&gt;I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intentionally in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;premise, the efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Congress) to try and enact laws that can keep people from suing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the gun manufacturers are highly misguided.  [I might be willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to grandfather certain very old weapons, but modern day products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be engineered to be safe.]
</EM><BR>
<P>I routinely try any such devices that come out.They are little more
<BR>
than gimicks and none works even remotely successfully.
<BR>
<P>The technology counter to urban myth, does not exist.
<BR>
<P>I will trade most of my personnal defense guns for a phaser when
<BR>
they exist, not before.
