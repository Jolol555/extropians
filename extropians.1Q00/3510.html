<P>
I've decided to go ahead with the creation of the Deep Anarchy
<BR>
List. Below is my proposal for most of the list Welcome message.
<BR>
(A few &quot;housekeeping details&quot; will be added.)
<BR>
<P>Your comments and suggestions are most welcome.
<BR>
<P>Frederick Mann
<BR>
<P><P>This welcome message for the Deep Anarchy List contains two parts:
<BR>
(1) List Purpose and Scope
<BR>
(2) General Guidelines for subscribers
<BR>
<P>Part 1: List Purpose and Scope
<BR>
----------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF &quot;THE STATE&quot;
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</A>&gt;, Max More, Ph.D.,
<BR>
President, Extropy Institute. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</A>&gt; (writing as
<BR>
Max T. O'Connor) coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Traditional anarchists want to abolish the &quot;State.&quot; In planning their
<BR>
strategies and in doing their thinking about this they rarely question
<BR>
the existence or fundamental nature of their enemy. This situation
<BR>
wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that their mistaken beliefs
<BR>
often lead them into counterproductive political strategies. Thus we
<BR>
observe the ludicrous sight of self-named anarchists joining political
<BR>
parties (usually the Libertarian Party) in order to hasten the end of
<BR>
the system. The idea seems to be: We can remove it by being
<BR>
absorbed by it!
<BR>
<P>I want to suggest that when we talk of &quot;the State&quot; we are not talking
<BR>
of any entity, either concrete or abstract. I will provide two main
<BR>
arguments for this: One from considerations of methodological
<BR>
individualism, and another that could be called &quot;the argument from
<BR>
fuzziness.&quot; &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot; is the view that results from these
<BR>
thoughts; it is the idea that we already live in an anarchy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The purpose of the list is to explore the deepest aspects of
<BR>
coercive political systems -- which manifest in individual human
<BR>
minds. According to Robert Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
<BR>
Maintenance':
<BR>
<P>&quot;But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to
<BR>
avoid repairs of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack
<BR>
effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon
<BR>
effects only, no change is possible. The true system, the real
<BR>
system, is our present construction of systematic thought itself,
<BR>
rationality itself. And if a factory is torn down but the rationality
<BR>
which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply
<BR>
produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic
<BR>
government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced
<BR>
that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat
<BR>
themselves in the succeeding government...&quot;
<BR>
<P>A Deep Anarchist is someone who has examined and radically
<BR>
changed certain &quot;systematic patterns of thought&quot; which most
<BR>
traditional anarchists take for granted, without question or
<BR>
challenge.
<BR>
<P>Max More indicates: &quot;Traditional anarchists want to abolish the
<BR>
&quot;State.&quot; In planning their strategies and in doing their thinking
<BR>
about this they rarely question the existence or fundamental
<BR>
nature of their enemy.&quot; For an examination of the &quot;enemy,&quot;
<BR>
see '#TL07B: The Nature of Government'
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.htm</A>&gt;.
<BR>
<P>The main purpose of the list is for subscribers to assist each
<BR>
other in becoming Deep Anarchists. A secondary purpose is
<BR>
to persuade others to also become Deep Anarchists. A further
<BR>
purpose is to explore appropriate strategies and tactics for
<BR>
Deep Anarchists to apply in order to expand freedom.
<BR>
<P>According to Sally Kempton: &quot;It is hard to fight an enemy
<BR>
who has outposts in your head.&quot; One of the insights of Deep
<BR>
Anarchy is that certain &quot;systematic patterns of thought&quot;
<BR>
(Pirsig) constitute &quot;enemy outposts&quot; in the heads of
<BR>
traditional anarchists that &quot;often lead them into
<BR>
counterproductive political strategies&quot; (More). Deep
<BR>
Anarchists have removed the &quot;enemy outposts&quot; from
<BR>
their heads.
<BR>
<P>According to Steve Biko: &quot;The most potent weapon in the
<BR>
hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.&quot;
<BR>
As a result of cultural conditioning, practically all humans,
<BR>
including most traditional anarchists, have certain &quot;enemy
<BR>
outposts&quot; (Kempton) or &quot;systematic patterns of thought&quot;
<BR>
(Pirsig) that &quot;often lead them into counterproductive political
<BR>
strategies&quot; (More). Deep Anarchists realize that in some
<BR>
important ways the minds of traditional anarchists are in
<BR>
a sense &quot;owned&quot; by their enemies and used as vehicles
<BR>
to reinforce, perpetuate, and propagate coercive political
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>Pemes = political memes. Deep Anarchists realize that
<BR>
the most fundamental &quot;enemy&quot; consists of certain Deep
<BR>
Pemes. The power of coercive political systems depend
<BR>
on these Deep Pemes being reinforced, perpetuated, and
<BR>
propagated without question or challenge. See '#TL074:
<BR>
PEME-THEORY - BASIC, INTERMEDIATE &amp; ADVANCED'
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm</A>&gt;.
<BR>
<P>Loosely speaking, traditional anarchists can be categorized
<BR>
as Anarcho-Socialists -- 'An Anarchist FAQ Webpage'
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931</A>&gt; -- and
<BR>
Anarcho-Capitalists -- 'Anarchist Theory FAQ' by Bryan Caplan
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm">http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm</A>&gt;.
<BR>
Unproductive arguments and attacks between the two sides,
<BR>
claiming that their anarchism is the &quot;only anarchism&quot; are not
<BR>
appropriate for the Deep Anarchy list. We want as many
<BR>
anarchists as possible to become Deep Anarchists.
<BR>
<P>Bridging gaps between Anarcho-Socialists and Anarcho-Capitalists
<BR>
is appropriate for the list.
<BR>
<P>Part 2: List Guidelines
<BR>
-----------------------
<BR>
<P>List-usage Rules:
<BR>
1) Please keep your posts relevant to the topic of Deep Anarchy.
<BR>
2) Subscription to the list is at the sole discretion of  the list
<BR>
owners. The list owners reserve the right to remove and/or ban
<BR>
anyone from the list at the owners' discretion.
<BR>
3) No personal or ad hominem attacks. Discussions among
<BR>
a large number of people will inevitably bring disagreements;
<BR>
however, counter-statements and opposing viewpoints should
<BR>
always be presented in a rational, logical, sensitive and mature
<BR>
manner. Anyone using the list to conduct personal attacks will
<BR>
be unsubscribed and permanently banned from the list.
<BR>
4) No &quot;make-wrong&quot; posts -- this means no messages whose
<BR>
purpose is strictly to tell another subscriber that he or she is
<BR>
wrong and that you are right. Please make a deliberate effort
<BR>
with every post to produce desirable results. It's much more
<BR>
productive when everyone focuses on producing desirable
<BR>
results. For essential reading on this see the 'bicameral stage
<BR>
2' section of: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm</A>&gt;.
<BR>
5) Please respect the time of others and refrain from posting
<BR>
time-wasting messages.
<BR>
6) No advertising or spamming.
<BR>
7) Owners and subscribers can invite anyone to subscribe to
<BR>
the list.
<BR>
8) Neither the list owners nor any subscribers can be
<BR>
held liable in any way for any information obtained in any
<BR>
form from this list. The list owners and maintainers
<BR>
are not responsible for any information or advice given on
<BR>
this list and make no claims for the competence of any
<BR>
advice or information mentioned by list subscribers.
<BR>
9) If you decide to remain subscribed to this discussion
<BR>
list, your doing so indicates agreement by you to all of the
<BR>
policies and guidelines outlined in this Welcome Message.
<BR>
Please unsubscribe immediately if you are unable to agree,
<BR>
by sending a blank email to:
<BR>
