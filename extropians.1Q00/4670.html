<P>Define &quot;using the alt registries&quot;.  Sure I suppose it would be easy to
<BR>
get a large number of Linucians (not all of them) to *recognize*
<BR>
domain.tux.  But who'd want such a domain unless they're publishing only
<BR>
material of interest to penguins?  And what is MS's customers'
<BR>
motivation to demand access to such material?
