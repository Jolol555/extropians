<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The &quot;ubiquitous transparancy&quot; will _not_ appear suddenly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Instead, those who consider themselves the rulers of various areas of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;planet will make sure that _they_ get the surveillance to control the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;others,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and prohibiting the others from using the surveillance against them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In short, you get a dictatorship in which those with the big guns get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;snoop on those with smaller (or no) guns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well the transparency I advocate is mutual, two-way, transparency.  Meaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the individual would be no more subject to surveillance than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government.  In fact my suggestion is &quot;power equivolent surveillance,&quot; such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the more power you have to meddle in others lives, the *more* you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject to surveillance.  In this scheme, the President and members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congress would live in a virtual fish bowl and we the people would be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to know virtually *everything* about their political, business and personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affairs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, I have to admit that I tend toward transparency fanaticism.  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were calling the shots there'd be no secrets, *none*.  I realize the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical difficulties (if not impossibilities) in implementing this anytime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soon.  But I do foresee a time when ubiquitous transparency will not only be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doable, but will be absolutely necessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>I share your enthusiasm for accountability for our elected and appointed
<BR>
leaders, however your proposal that they have more surveillance than the
<BR>
average person runs counter to every security protocol of any leader
<BR>
security detail that ever kept its subject alive for more than 5
<BR>
minutes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When we have gotten past national sovereignty and moved on to cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democratic global governance, there will be no need for such things as state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secrets and national security.  At that point we will only be concerned with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1) individual security and (2) global security.  Both of those types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security would best be served by ubiquitous transparency.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
<BR>
other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually nothing
<BR>
but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market and
<BR>
use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
<BR>
corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
<BR>
bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
<BR>
money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
<BR>
are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
<BR>
formation of other corporate structures as well...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Since you also advocate gun control (meaning those with the big guns get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to disarm those with smaller guns), you advocate that those who consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;themselves the rulers (a) get to snoop on everybody else, (b) one cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;use weapons to overthrow them, and (c) you cannot find out what they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In short, you get a dictatorship which make the old ones, SSSR, Mainland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;China, and Nazi Germany look like democratic societies in comparison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know the NRA doesn't like to let this be known but: &quot;gun control&quot; is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synonymous with total disarmament.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
<BR>
sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
<BR>
allowed to become law.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Power corrupts, so why give the power brokers more of it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't advocate that at all.  I propose giving more power to those are less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful.  I do propose opening the flood gates of surveillance, but its a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two-way floodgate, and I'd call for more information about the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flowing to the people than the other way around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Since the powerful will have greater computational resources, they will
<BR>
be able to make better use of the intelligence value of this ubiquitous
<BR>
surveillance, so even if everyone has the same 'access' (or even if the
<BR>
powerful have 'less' access, they will still make better use of the data
<BR>
and will be able to oppress people more as a result. Surveillance is
<BR>
merely an intelligence gathering channel. Its value is directly related
<BR>
to how much you can process in a given amount of time, and how much
<BR>
useless data you can filter out. Unless you are going to mandate that
<BR>
everyone have exactly the same amount of computing power, no more, no
<BR>
less, then your scheme cannot work as you envision it, and it will
<BR>
become a tool of repression for the powerful.
