</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a hopeful inventor can someone explain to me why patents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considered bad?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their hard won intellectual efforts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; No.  In a free capitalist society, people should profit from the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; exchange of goods or services with other individuals, or any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; freely entered profitable contract or dealing.  By contrast, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain a patent, you prevent me, via a state granted monopoly on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; particular implementation of an idea, from using my own intelligence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; labor and industry to similarly profit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem is that it is pretty difficult for the second guy to prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he never had any input from the first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How is that my problem?  That does not justify using the machinery of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state to prohibit me from using my own intelligence and labor as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see fit.  That's what your use of a patent to restrict me does.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it doesn't. You can even go to the patent office, buy a copy of the patent
<BR>
file, take it home, and build the device or whatever. Its perfectly legal, you
<BR>
don't owe anybody anything, you just can't make money off of the other guy's
<BR>
idea. The presumption is that once one person has had an original idea and its
<BR>
been published, the 'land' occupied by that idea in the world of memespace has
<BR>
now been claimed and is being developed, and that this meme now exists as an
<BR>
entity in society, so it is not possible to call any other invention of the same
<BR>
idea as original, unless you can somehow prove that you never had been exposed
<BR>
to that idea or its offshoots before.. If you think that you have an equal
<BR>
'right of access' to that memespace, then you are no better than a socialist who
<BR>
is against property rights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Moreover, under what theory of rights do you obtain exclusive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership of a technology just because you were first?
</EM><BR>
<P>The same theory of rights that grants a land patent to a homesteader who stakes
<BR>
the first claim on that undeveloped land.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Only one in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which rights derive from state grants.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, state grants are derived from the concept that the state is entrusted by the
<BR>
people with unclaimed land that is assumed to belong to all, to disburse it in
<BR>
fair portions as developers seek to claim and develop that land.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We all routinely benefit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilization and nobody makes us pay.  I'm typing in a house that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; central heating.  I enjoy this but I haven't paid the inventor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; houses or furnaces.  What a calamity!
</EM><BR>
<P>Since patents do not last in perpetuity, and houses and central heating date
<BR>
back to the time of early civilization, the memes of 'house' and 'central
<BR>
heating' have become fair use technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is a non-problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Any moron can look at an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; invention and smack their head, saying, oh yeah I see how that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In what way does this justify the state's stepping in and assigning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership of a technology?
</EM><BR>
<P>because once an inventor has published his invention to the general public, then
<BR>
its not possible for another person to be able to claim that they had originated
<BR>
that idea subsequently, so it was not actually a new creation of that person's
<BR>
mind, but a recycling of an existing idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Deal freely with other people, or are you afraid to do so and have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call in the nanny state to help?
</EM><BR>
<P>In a society where not many people seem to think that others should be paid as
<BR>
fairly for their honest work as they themselves would like to be, and where
<BR>
concepts of integrity and honesty have nearly lost their meaning, either have
<BR>
the state do it, or let me start enforcing the old codes of honor and integrity
<BR>
as it used to be done. Only a gullible dupe would blindly trust everyone without
<BR>
protection like you seem to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If&gt; they go and start making their own without ever having actually bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the original device from the original inventor, are they really an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inventor, or just a cheap shallow crook with no consideration for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; others?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is it theft to learn from others' ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is theft, plagiarism, and basically dishonest to use another's ideas without
<BR>
credit and requested recompense. If you don't understand this basic concept,
<BR>
then I have no basis to trust you either. Men who do not understand honor have
<BR>
no honor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe the original inventor should have made the person in question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sign an NDA.
</EM><BR>
<P>A patent is a societal NDA. If I invented the automobile, and I made every
<BR>
person who bought a car from me sign an NDA, I would also have to require that
<BR>
anyone they ever showed the car to to sign an NDA as well. How feasible is that?
<BR>
That is the main reason why using only contract law to protect intellectual
<BR>
property fails, and why patents were created to redress that need.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nah, that would require the inventor to actually work hard to protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this right.  Better for the state to just give her a handout, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>As opposed to letting everyone else steal her ideas? Enforcing the law and
<BR>
mandating that members of soceity operate honestly is not a handout, it is
<BR>
justice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is coercive, oppressive and destructive, as well as against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are mistaken.  The parallel is entirely in your head.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this case it is you who are arguing for the omnipotent state to act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the arbiter of property, and it is I who am arguing for free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade.  You are taking the socialist line here.
</EM><BR>
<P>No I am not. The anarcho-socialist argument is that property rights don't exist
<BR>
because they infringe on other individuals 'right of free access'. Opponents of
<BR>
patents are using the same principle with original ideas. Just as there is a
<BR>
limit to the amount of land on the planet, once you've sold one piece of land,
<BR>
you cant sell it again to someone else, once a person has had an original idea
<BR>
and it has been published publicly, then it is not possible for someone else to
<BR>
have originated that idea. Given a finite universe, there are a finite number of
<BR>
ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is intellectual property worth less because it springs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes so easily from the creative mind?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, make all the profits you want off your legitimate intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; property.  (Hint -- if your so-called property derives from a grant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the government, its legitimacy is highly questionable.  In this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; case, it's a government hand out.)  I make profits from my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual property -- I write computer programs, and help people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; integrate other peoples' software into their systems.  These profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; do not depend on coercing others into not doing likewise.  That's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; bullies' game, not fit for free women and men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; However patent protection makes sure that EVERY user of your invention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pays his fair share,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The universal sign of the socialist argument!  Let the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide what is &quot;fair&quot; and redistribute the wealth accordingly.
</EM><BR>
<P>The government does NOT decide what is fair, the market decides what the fair
<BR>
value of a particular patent is. All the government does is make sure that
<BR>
everyone who uses that idea actually pays for it what the market determines it
<BR>
is worth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No thanks, I prefer free dealing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Free stealing you mean.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; which is not the case currently with software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where you have between 20-50% piracy rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does the existence of burglary justify the government deciding who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owns which houses and doling them out in arbitrary 17 year periods to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whoever can claim them first?  Please take your statist schemes elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>The existence of burglary justifies the government:
<BR>
a) allowing homeowners to shoot intruders
<BR>
b) making it a crime to break and enter
<BR>
c) hiring police to investigate such crimes and bring criminals to justice.
<BR>
d) protect the original land claims of the first settlers on that land through
<BR>
the justice system.
<BR>
<P>Whether the 'government' is a monopoly state or a competetive PPL system is
<BR>
irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>If you think burglary is ok, then be prepared to get shot, arrested, and/or
<BR>
jailed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Those who pay for software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; licenses wind up paying for the pirates, feel gyped, and are more likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to commit piracy themselves as a result. They know they are getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shafted, but not by who they think they are...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can protect my own property thank you.   I don't need the nanny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state and its protection racket.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Prove it. Show me a system where you can protect a milliion copies of a software
<BR>
application distributed around the world from being pirated. It hasn't been
<BR>
invented yet.
