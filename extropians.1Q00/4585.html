<EM>&gt; &gt; Right!  You almost said it here Greg.  *Why* do you think this attitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has finally changed?  It because we have good battle simulators running...

<P>That works for me.  The good guys are way ahead.  {8-]  Also, that is
<BR>
one rare example of military technology that really does have good
<BR>
commercial spinoffs: faster computers, more programmers, etc.  Take
<BR>
a look at some of the better flight simulators.  You might be impressed
<BR>
with the realism: they sim such subtleties as the moment of inertia
<BR>
coupling, high speed sub-mach buffet, performace loss at altitude, the
<BR>
real performance characteristics of the planes.  Perhaps this will
<BR>
eventually be seen as a first step in creating sims good enough to
<BR>
fool an uploaded human.  spike
