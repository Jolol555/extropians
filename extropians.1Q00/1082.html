Hal Finney commented on my proposals:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) Have courts enforce a rule that policy makers must always (except for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; specific exceptions) prefer a market estimate over other sources when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; estimating matters of fact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This seems the most reasonable approach to me, although as I wrote I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see why it has to be enforced by courts.  Ultimately, if IF proves its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value the system should be self enforcing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Self-enforcing?  That depends on how you think democracy works.  Maybe, if
<BR>
you thought voters would always severely punish any politician who ever
<BR>
deviated from following what voters abstractly thought was the best source
<BR>
of information.  But there are reasons to suspect politics isn't like this.
<BR>
(And if voters perfectly disciplined politicians, why have any court review
<BR>
of political choices?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2) Have the rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that there is more than an X (=75%?) chance that a random jury, chosen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; twenty years later ... would agree that D was better ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I suspect it would be hard to find this much certainty on most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controversial issues.  So this rule would probably not be used much.
</EM><BR>
<P>The more this was a problem, the lower a value of X one might choose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 3) Choose ... something like GDP ... independent ... agency ... update ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says that ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; D gives the highest conditional estimate for this national objective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Choosing that objective function would be a massive political battle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Chances are people would want to change it from year to year, too, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their concerns change.  Education is the big issue one year; the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's crime, the next it's taxes, then it's growth.  People wouldn't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to turn their political decisions over to a formula that they couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change as needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure changing the objective yearly would be that much of a problem.
<BR>
As long as the time when the objective is measured is several decades in
<BR>
the future, I don't think sort of annual variation politics would induce
<BR>
would make that much difference in which decisions this system (which
<BR>
I'm calling &quot;futarchy&quot;) would prefer, at least compared to our current
<BR>
system.  There is a lot of correlation across countries in GDP, lifespan,
<BR>
education, environmental cleanliness, etc.  Bad decisions that governments
<BR>
make mostly hurt all these things, rather than trading one for another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But aside from these issues, the more important first step is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have some way for IF to be tested.  I don't think the online game at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;www.ideosphere.com has had very meaningful results ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If there is to be significant support for using IF in the political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;process then it must be given an opportunity to prove its worth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't see that happening any time soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes of course we need better tests, and yes the value of ideosphere as
<BR>
a test is greatly limited because its only play money.  Anyone help in
<BR>
arranging better tests would be greatly appreciated.
