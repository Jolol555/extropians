<EM>&gt; Disk capacity is an issue, however. Only a PC built after 1985 has the

<P>In the debased literature of possession which pervades modern
<BR>
popular culture, which I am familiar with mainly via trashy
<BR>
made-for-TV movies (such as the _Amityville Horror_ cycle), very
<BR>
simple appliances, such as lamps, can be possessed.  However, serious
<BR>
students of possession, such as the good clergyman, may well know
<BR>
better.  Of course, the recurring theme of possessed **houses**
<BR>
may indicate too great a weight of evidence to be so easily
<BR>
dismissed (;-&gt; ;-&gt;).
<BR>
<P>Speaking of haunted houses -- have you ever read J. G. Ballard's
<BR>
high-tech take on this theme _The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista_?
<BR>
It's a story in the wonderful Vermilion Sands sequence, written
<BR>
during the late 50's and early 60's.  Don't let the dates fool
<BR>
you -- Ballard was heavy into launching the New Wave movement, much
<BR>
to the irritation of many SF traditionalists.  I suspect that
<BR>
many Extropians react to Ballard the way the SF conservatives did --
<BR>
there's a deliciously subversive Entropian theme pervading his
<BR>
work -- a sort of languid resignation to decay and the winding
<BR>
down of things, which I find strangely compelling, at times.
<BR>
Part of me resonates strongly to his portrayal of &quot;beach fatigue&quot;.
