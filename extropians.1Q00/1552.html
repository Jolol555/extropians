<P>Do you feel that with the end of the Cold War and subversion
<BR>
of main counter-movements to the mainstream, there is growing
<BR>
turning to repression against the most fundamental personal
<BR>
attempts to liberate one's personal and social behavior, appearance
<BR>
and perceptions?
<BR>
<P>The fact that people either don't resist (I assume that if one resisted
<BR>
arrest for illegal dancing in the street, or anything else, by
<BR>
doing *whatever it takes* to continue it, they would be murdered
<BR>
police on the spot - they just don't try to assert their rights
<BR>
anymore) or are invisible (hundreds of thousands of people robbed 
<BR>
of their possessions, freedoms, and beaten and raped daily in jails
<BR>
for completely harmless activities, away from the social eye, just like
<BR>
GULAG in Russia), this doesn't make it better.
<BR>
<P>I would assert that most of American population would be considered
<BR>
guilty of jailable offences if they were caught.
<BR>
<P>If this is not a definition of a cruel repressive regime, I don't
<BR>
know what is.
<BR>
<P>As with the Gulag, the population that hasn't been jailed yet was 
<BR>
brainwashed to support persecution of some activities, desperately
<BR>
hopes they won't be caught for others, and prefers to discuss idiotic
<BR>
non-issues rather than growing repressions.
<BR>
<P>And I don't see any viable opposition.
