<P>
<EM>&gt;As I recall, John K. Clark assumes the existence of qualia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on experience and Dan Fabulich claims we have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason to make such assumptions.  The only way to settle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this dispute is to find evidence that qualia do not exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even more important and fundamental is to define the components of
<BR>
propositions being made. In terms of the existence of qualia, we must,
<BR>
BEFORE anything else, define both existence
<BR>
and qualia. We have defined qualia many times, so I won't bore you again,
<BR>
but not existence. This, like a great many other commonly used words is
<BR>
assumed defined, the existence of a coherent symbolic counterpart in our
<BR>
minds being the source of the assumption. But these symbols, useful to the
<BR>
animal within us, are far from dependable when working with pure logic. In
<BR>
fact, they don't have to have any counterpart in reality at all.
<BR>
The failure of certain people to acknowledge the above leads to propositions
<BR>
such as &quot;Qualia does not exist&quot;. Well, my definition for entities that exist
<BR>
is those entities I can perceive through my senses either directly or
<BR>
indirectly. I know of no other definition. Given this, it is irrational to
<BR>
propose that qualia do not &quot;exist&quot;, since we all directly perceive them.
<BR>
I could go on all day, but the points I'd make I've already posted several
<BR>
times to no effect.
<BR>
Got any comments folks? Any alternative definitions of existence? From here
<BR>
we can begin a real debate - not from ten miles down a line of highly
<BR>
questionable personal assumptions as is usually the case. Take out the
<BR>
ambiguity from the bottom up, and then you'll see former matters of opinion
<BR>
become matters of fact, and real progress on issues can be made, avoiding
<BR>
the &quot;who's got the biggest golden hat?&quot; game that humans seem incapable of
<BR>
avoiding even when engaged in supposed rational debate.
