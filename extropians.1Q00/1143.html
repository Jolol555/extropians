<EM>&gt; &gt;[Spike is] acquainted with a bright child who had not, at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; age of 5, been introduced to the concept of death.

<EM>&gt; &quot;sheltered environment&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (middle class-America) is in a fairly direct way responsible for costing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me amounts ranging from 6 to 7 figures.

<P>Wow Robert!  I didnt know you had *that* kinda money!  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  If you want to be a bit harsher, don't hesitate to demonstrate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that its dog-eat-dog as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you Robert.  I didnt think it was a good idea to raise
<BR>
the girls the way my friends did, but I had to go along, since I am
<BR>
prochoice when it comes to other peoples kids.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>My notion is that little children can accept death easier than older
<BR>
ones can, especially if you go down the road of explaining that
<BR>
every living thing is made up of jillions of tiny cells, so that when
<BR>
one wretched beast devours another, the cells of the second
<BR>
beast join up with the cells of the first.
<BR>
<P>Not terribly accurate, but maybe its the way to explain harsh
<BR>
realities to kids.  Then you can also bring in the safety angle:
<BR>
&quot;Be careful, we like your cells collected the way they are now...&quot;
<BR>
etc.
