A challenge for the next century!Introduction: On February the 28th, 2000, 
<BR>
it was 100 years since the birth of my grandfather Bredo Morstøl, presently 
<BR>
in cryonic suspension in Nederland,Colorado.  He has now been suspended for 
<BR>
10 years.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I was very impressed by the scope of your vision and hopes for the future of 
<BR>
society.  I liked the focus on personal freedom to travel and emergency 
<BR>
preparedness.  You could be the father of the survivalist/transhumanist 
<BR>
movement! :)
<BR>
<P>Congratulations to your grandfather for being suspended.  perhaps, one day I 
<BR>
will get to meet him in the flesh!  What organization is maintaining him 
<BR>
while in suspension?
<BR>
<P><P>you wrote:
<BR>
And let us be sure our constitutional charter makes it a punishable felony 
<BR>
to attempt to outlaw the most life-extending treatments like cryonics &amp; 
<BR>
human cloning.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>To me this would be a violation of a person's right to stand up for what 
<BR>
they view is right.  I could never agree with this.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, welcome to the list.  I hope the world takes on the shape you 
<BR>
envision.  I want to learn more about the communities on the high sea's you 
<BR>
are developing.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
