<EM> &gt; I keep wondering why the US, keeps becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; more and more restrictive and intolerant as the time
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; passes, I remember that as a child and as a teenager
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I admired this country because it was a country where
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you suposedly were free, and had the chance to improve
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; your life quality as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me just add a &quot;me, too&quot; from the UK. If half the rhetoric
<BR>
about freedom coming out of the USA was true, I'd be queuing up
<BR>
to immigrate. Alas, it isn't. The USA is just another country,
<BR>
albeit a very big one, with the usual range of political pathologies.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; So my theory is that this drug war, is just a tool
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of control a silent weapon to rob people of their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; liberties, a tool to justify racism (most of drug
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; related incarcerations, happen in poor black
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; districts) it is also used to justify US intervention
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in foreign lands (like communisn was used before)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and I don't doubt it'll be also a tool to gradually
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; erode our civil rights
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not deliberate, though. There's no evil cabal of masterminds
<BR>
who sat down at a committee table one morning and said &quot;right, now
<BR>
how can we grab control of civil society and justify a neo-imperialist
<BR>
foreign policy in the nake of fighting crime?&quot;
<BR>
<P>You might want to consider who profits from the War on Drugs:
<BR>
<P>1)  Every police department that's profited from the sale of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assets seized under civil forfeiture laws
<BR>
<P>2)  Every politician who's been able to cut budget requirements by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forcing the cops to rely on (1) as a revenue centre
<BR>
<P>3)  Every senior police officer who's used the WoD as justification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for recruiting more officers (thus putting them in charge of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bigger department)
<BR>
<P>4)  Everyone who works as an employee in the prison system (especially
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the _private_ prison system)
<BR>
<P>5)  Anyone who works for the FBI, DEA, or the rest of the Federal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anti-drug apparatus (owing their whole lifestyle to the WoD)
<BR>
<P>6)  Every politician who's been able to make sound-bite time out of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;striking a tough pose on drugs
<BR>
<P>7)  Every banker or S&amp;L officer who's quietly accepted large deposits
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of dirty money and recycled it in some other form
<BR>
<P>8)  Every drug dealer who has been able to sell cocaine for US $100
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gram ... when as a pharmacist a decade ago I use to buy it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wholesale at pharmaceutical quality for US $7 for 5 grams.
<BR>
<P>Dropping the WoD unconditionally at this stage would damage the US
<BR>
economy to the tune of something like $100Bn-$150Bn a year in turnover.
<BR>
This would be Bad for Business. It'd even hit the GDP!
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; However fortunately it is the goverment who wants
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to do this, not the average citizen, and although the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; majory is willing to trade their freedom for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;security&quot; most people is becoming aware of this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with the passage of time, and fertile positive meme
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; petri dishes (like this list) keep informing people, so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it is very probable that this advance towards restriction
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and intolerance can be stopped, and that parties like
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the libertarian are getting more powerful (although
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I still believe no single party should have all the power)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; any comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>Technology determines what laws can be enforced, and how intrusive
<BR>
such enforcement will be. It also renders old laws obsolescent and
<BR>
new laws necessary. Unfortunately, legislators are not technologically
<BR>
literate; they tend to be lawyers or accountants. Rapidly changing
<BR>
technology therefore makes a terrible background for a democratic
<BR>
legislature that is primarily populated by people who don't have a
<BR>
clue what's going on around them.
<BR>
<P>I figure the popularity of libertarianism among workers in the high-tech
<BR>
sector in the USA has something to do with the libertarian stance on
<BR>
civil liberties (which I agree with), and something to do with disgust
<BR>
over  the general inability of government to get to grips with providing
<BR>
the environment a high-tech industrial sector requires -- the economic
<BR>
side of the coin. Calls for cutting back government are, as often as
<BR>
not, a plea to &quot;stop them pissing in the swimming pool, now!&quot;
