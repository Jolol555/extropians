<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    February 1, 2000
<BR>
<P>THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD HAS A GOOD MEMORY
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By compiling all the solar wind data gathered in the space 
<BR>
age, NASA scientists have concluded that even though the solar 
<BR>
magnetic field is constantly changing, it always returns to its 
<BR>
original shape and position.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We now know that the Sun's magnetic field has a memory 
<BR>
and returns to approximately the same configuration in each 11-
<BR>
year solar cycle,&quot; said Dr. Marcia Neugebauer, a Distinguished 
<BR>
Visiting Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, 
<BR>
Calif.  &quot;Current theories imply that the field is generated by 
<BR>
random, churning motions within the Sun and should have no long-
<BR>
term memory.  Despite this expectation, the underlying magnetic 
<BR>
structure remains fixed at the same solar longitude.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's interesting that the solar magnetic field varies in 
<BR>
strength and direction, but not in longitude,&quot; said Dr. Edward 
<BR>
Smith, senior research scientist at JPL.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solar wind is composed of charged particles ejected from 
<BR>
the Sun that flow continuously through interplanetary space.  The 
<BR>
solar wind carries part of the Sun's magnetic field into space.  
<BR>
Before completing this research, scientists knew that features of 
<BR>
the solar wind reaching the Earth tended to repeat about every 27 
<BR>
days, said Neugebauer.  The new information pinpoints the 
<BR>
repetition interval at 27 days and 43 minutes and shows that the 
<BR>
Sun has kept this steady rhythm, much like a metronome, for at 
<BR>
least 38 years.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern escaped previous detection because it is a very 
<BR>
subtle statistical effect.  There are many larger variations in 
<BR>
the solar wind that come and go, which largely mask the 
<BR>
underlying pattern.  This repetitive behavior can't be seen if 
<BR>
these data are examined for only a few months or years, but it 
<BR>
was revealed in this 38-year database.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why the Sun's magnetic field behaves in this way is a 
<BR>
puzzle, but the answer must lie deep within the Sun,&quot; Smith said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're trying to understand how magnetic fields are 
<BR>
generated in the Sun, the planets and the stars,&quot; said 
<BR>
Neugebauer.  &quot;A better understanding of how the Sun generates its 
<BR>
magnetic field will help us better understand the solar wind and 
<BR>
space weather.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluids conducting electricity under the Sun's surface 
<BR>
generate the magnetic field, Neugebauer explained, and the 
<BR>
field's apparent memory is most likely caused by a structure and 
<BR>
process occurring deeper inside the Sun than previously believed.  
<BR>
&quot;There may be something asymmetric about the Sun's interior, 
<BR>
perhaps a deep-seated lump of old magnetic field,&quot; she said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings, published in the February 1 issue of the 
<BR>
Journal of Geophysical Research, are based on all the solar wind 
<BR>
data collected from the dawn of space exploration through 1998, 
<BR>
both by Earth-orbiting satellites and interplanetary spacecraft.  
<BR>
This includes about 335,000 hours of solar wind speed data and 
<BR>
250,000 hours of magnetic field data.  Co-authors of the article, 
<BR>
in addition to Neugebauer and Smith, are Drs. Alexander 
<BR>
Ruzmaikin, Joan Feynman and Arthur Vaughn, all of JPL.
