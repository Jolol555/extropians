<P>This is my best effort at a summary of Karyn Ashburn's talk.  I
<BR>
promised to show it to her before I posted so she could make
<BR>
corrections or additions.  Since I emailed it to her sister Elise 10
<BR>
days ago, I believe I've fulfilled that promise.  I haven't heard back
<BR>
from her yet, but should she reply, I'll be sure to post whatever she
<BR>
has to say.

<BR>
Minicon Panel Report (VERY long)
<BR>
<P>The best piece of programming I attended at Minicon was a panel, or
<BR>
rather a lecture, by Karyn Ashburn, Elise Mattheson's sister.  She is
<BR>
a speech therapist, with lots of initials after her name, who works
<BR>
with adult populations, many of whom are nonverbal or barely verbal,
<BR>
and she isn't a member of fandom.  As the sister of a member of
<BR>
fandom, however, she's had an opportunity to observe us in one of our
<BR>
native habitats when meeting Elise at conventions.  And as a non-fan
<BR>
and a person passionately interested in speech production, she's
<BR>
noticed some common features in the way fans verbally communicate.
<BR>
<P>We were lucky in that she hadn't shown up for her panel at 5:00 on
<BR>
Saturday, which would have been in a smallish function room and
<BR>
restricted to only an hour.  Instead she was rescheduled for after
<BR>
closing ceremonies in the ballroom, so a large fraction of the
<BR>
convention members had a chance to hear her.  Because we wouldn't let
<BR>
her leave, her talk ended up being about 2 1/2 hours long, but she
<BR>
still left us with a lot of questions.  I recommend her as a speaker
<BR>
to any convention.  The bare gist of what she said follows.
<BR>
<P>On those occasions when she showed up at a con to meet Elise, she saw
<BR>
lots of fans in groups talking.  To her they seemed angry and rude.
<BR>
To Elise they seemed nothing of the sort.  Observing them more
<BR>
closely, she realized that they were using different social cues,
<BR>
different body language, different eye contact, and even different
<BR>
ways of forming vowels than what she jokingly called &quot;my people&quot;, or
<BR>
what for convenience sake I'll call mundanes.  She hastened to say
<BR>
she doesn't have a theory, or even yet much of a hypothesis for why
<BR>
this may be (or a large enough sample size across populations to
<BR>
prove that this is so), but she does have a lot of questions.
<BR>
<P>She also seemed quite concerned that we would feel offended by what
<BR>
she had to say, but what she told us was so interesting, and often so
<BR>
recognizably true, that I don't think anyone was.  Of course
<BR>
everything that I'm about to say is an overgeneralization; different
<BR>
fans possess these traits to greater or lesser degrees.
<BR>
<P>First, the mechanics of actual vocal production, especially vowels.
<BR>
The phonemes in the words &quot;him&quot; and &quot;meet&quot; are produced with the
<BR>
tounge in various positions, and the lips stretched back.  The
<BR>
phonemes &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; are produced with rounded lips.  This, at any
<BR>
rate, is the case in mundania.  Fans, she has noticed, push the
<BR>
vowels forward; rounding the lips somewhat even for &quot;ee&quot; and &quot;ih&quot;.
<BR>
We use our lips a lot, but at the same time, we use our cheeks and
<BR>
our chins not as often as would be expected.  We stabilize the cheeks
<BR>
and the chin, and we &quot;prolabialize&quot;. (When, while sitting at a table,
<BR>
I leaned my chin on my hands while talking to her, she became
<BR>
uncomfortable.  She can't do that easily; her chin moves more when
<BR>
she speaks.)
<BR>
<P>Second, fans articulate more than mundanes.  She had various of us
<BR>
stand up and say things, and then repeated them in &quot;mundane&quot;.  When I
<BR>
said the phrase &quot;talk to&quot;, she pointed out that I had pronounced the
<BR>
&quot;k&quot; on the end of &quot;talk&quot;.  Mundanes, she said, wouldn't.  We
<BR>
pronounce more of the terminal consonents in a phrase than a typical
<BR>
mundane does.  We are more likely than mundanes to pronounce the &quot;h&quot;
<BR>
in &quot;where&quot;, and the &quot;l&quot; in &quot;folk&quot;.  (She seemed to think it was
<BR>
rather charming; that we were preserving old pronounciations, or
<BR>
reinventing them from the way words are spelled.)
<BR>
<P>We also speak in larger word groupings between breaths.  This does
<BR>
not necessarily mean that we speak faster; we just pause for a
<BR>
shorter time between words -- except where there is punctuation.  She
<BR>
pointed out that when Teresa Nielsen Hayden said she came from Mesa,
<BR>
Arizona, Teresa actually pronounced the comma by putting a slightly
<BR>
longer pause there, while most mundanes would simply run the words
<BR>
together.  Mundanes slur a lot of consonents that we pronounce
<BR>
individually.  We use punctuation in our spoken utterances.
<BR>
Sometimes we even footnote.
<BR>
<P>What we say in those large word groupings is also different.  We tend
<BR>
to use complete sentences, and complex sentence structure.  When we
<BR>
pause, or say &quot;uh&quot;, it tends to be towards the beginning of a
<BR>
statement, as we formulate the complete thought.  The &quot;idea&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;information&quot; portion of a statement is paramount; emotional
<BR>
reassurance, the little social noises (mm-hmm) are reduced or
<BR>
omitted.  We get to the heart of what we want to say -- if someone
<BR>
asks us how to do something we tell them, not leading up to it gently
<BR>
with &quot;have you tried doing it this way?&quot;
<BR>
<P>This leads us to body language.  Our body language is also different
<BR>
from mundanes.  We tend to not use eye contact nearly as often; when
<BR>
we do, it often signifies that it's the other person's turn to speak
<BR>
now.  This is opposite of everyone else.  In mundania, it's
<BR>
*breaking* eye contact that signals turn-taking, not *making* eye
<BR>
contact.  She demonstrated this on DDB; breaking eye contact and
<BR>
turning slightly away, and he felt insulted.  On the other hand, his
<BR>
sudden staring at her eyes made her feel like a professor had just
<BR>
said &quot;justify yourself NOW&quot;.  Mutual &quot;rudeness&quot;; mixed signals.
<BR>
<P>We use our hands when we talk, but don't seem to know what to do with
<BR>
our arms.  When thinking how to put something we close our eyes or
<BR>
look to the side and up, while making little &quot;hang on just a second&quot;
<BR>
gestures to show that we're not finished talking.  We interrupt each
<BR>
other to finish sentences, and if the interrupter got it right, we
<BR>
know we've communicated and let them speak; if they get it wrong we
<BR>
talk right over them.  This is not perceived as rude, or not very
<BR>
rude.
<BR>
<P>We accept corrections on matters of fact and of pronunciation; when I
<BR>
asked her about whether fanspeak might be related to Asperger's
<BR>
Syndrome, and mispronounced &quot;Asperger's&quot;, I was corrected in
<BR>
mid-sentence by the man sitting next to me, corrected myself, thanked
<BR>
him, and finished the sentence.  One Doesn't Do That in Mundania.
<BR>
Fans understand that mispronouncing words one has only read is very
<BR>
common in fandom, and not mortally embarrassing.
<BR>
<P>When we make a joke, we don't do a little laugh in the middle of a
<BR>
word to signal that it's funny; we inhale and exhale a very fast,
<BR>
short breath at the end of the sentence, rather like a suppressed
<BR>
beginning of a laugh, or a kind of a gasp.
<BR>
<P>She didn't get much into why this is all the case (I think she was
<BR>
surprised at the laughter when she suggested diffidently that we
<BR>
might be a bit under socialized.  No, really?? &lt;grin&gt;), and turned
<BR>
away questions about possible pathology.  While more comfortable with
<BR>
us now, I suspect she was probably still worried about offending us.
<BR>
She did suggest that many of the common features of fanspeak seem to
<BR>
be related to thinking in &quot;written English&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The day before, while waiting for her sister to show up, Elise had
<BR>
suggested that perhaps the overuse of the lips and underuse of cheeks
<BR>
and chin had come from very small children wanting to communicate
<BR>
complex ideas to grownups; the facial muscles still being
<BR>
underdeveloped, the easiest way to articulate would be to concentrate
<BR>
on the lips, holding the cheeks and chin still as a way to reduce the
<BR>
complexity of word formation.
<BR>
<P>I hope others who were at the panel can expand upon what I've
<BR>
reported, especially the parts I may have ommited.  It truly was the
<BR>
most interesting lecture or panel I've ever attended, and I can't
<BR>
recommend her too highly if you can convince her to speak at a
<BR>
convention you're involved with.  It would both give her more test
<BR>
subjects and us more cool information &lt;grin&gt;.
