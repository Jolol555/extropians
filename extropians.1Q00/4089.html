Later someone said that to ridicule anything by saying anything-

schmanything, or *-schm* is to ridicule Jewish people!

<P>I had a teacher in highschool who taught languages and was born and raised 
<BR>
in France.  We would poke fun at the French language by saying, &quot;Le class&quot; 
<BR>
or quite simply putting &quot;le&quot; before any noun we spoke.  This really 
<BR>
infuriated the French sensibilities of our young and beautiful teacher who 
<BR>
would immediately demand an end to it.  That was the only time I ever saw 
<BR>
her really mad!
<BR>
<P><P>those French!,
