Here is a post I made to the list on February 24, 1998.  I have not
<BR>
looked into the topic further since then but this was my evaluation
<BR>
based on studying the web site at that time:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't find Dr. Mills' credentials or his theory very impressive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He's a medical doctor, with no degree in physics.  He has created a theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that says that the electrons in hydrogen atoms can drop to lower than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the standard lowest-energy orbital, when interacting with a &quot;secret&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; catalyst that he has invented.  This releases heat, so he is trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get people to invest in his mysterious energy-production technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He runs these chambers with hydrogen gas and his catalyst.  He has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; input heat to ionize the hydrogen, but when he measures heat output it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems like more is coming out than was going in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is very similar to the cold fusion story.  Doing calorimetry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (measuring heat in and out) accurately is much more difficult than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-specialists realize.  It is easy to get false results by not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accounting for all the changes properly.  There is also the possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that some chemical reaction is occuring with the hydrogen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The hydrogen atom is the most thoroughly studied in physics.  The chances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that some chemical interaction can cause electrons to take up orbitals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forbidden by quantum mechanics, but that nobody else has noticed it before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this MD did, seem impossibly small.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The secrecy, the attempts to raise money by claiming a virtually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inexhaustable source of energy, setting up a business rather than doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional scientific research, all point to it being a scam.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
