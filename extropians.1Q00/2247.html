<EM>&gt; &gt;1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The answer to the first question seems to be: suprisingly low.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Goodness, no.  Vaccination remains the only effective treatment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for smallpox, even today.  Given that smallpox is transmitted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;through the air human-to-human, and that it's mortality is ~30%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in populations adapted to it, and that virtually everybody used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to get it, about 2 billion owe their lives to that one.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jenner's famous small pox inoculation was devised ~1800, though
<BR>
a similar treatment was common before.  Unfortunately, this is
<BR>
before we have good mortality cause data.  The first good data
<BR>
in England are from ~1850, when only ~1% of deaths were from
<BR>
smallpox.  So it is hard to say how much smallpox medicine reduced
<BR>
mortality before 1850, but it clearly couldn't contribute more than
<BR>
~1% after.  (Also, a source I found said that smallpox was ~10% of
<BR>
mortality across Europe in ~1700s.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Some others I can think of are whooping cough,
</EM><BR>
<P>When the Whooping Cough vaccine was introduced to the US ~ 1930,
<BR>
that disease only accounted for ~1/200 of deaths.  And death
<BR>
rates from it seemed to be falling as fast before the vaccine
<BR>
as after.
