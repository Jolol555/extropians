organized during the conference itself, advance proposals may be

for the mornings and exhibition sessions for the afternoons.
<BR>
<P><P>CONFERENCE VENUE
<BR>
<P>The conference will be held at Chandeliers, the conference facility of

<BR>
<P><P>WELCOME RECEPTION
<BR>
<P>A welcome reception will be held from 6:30pm to 8:00pm on Monday,

February 21, 2000, the evening of the first day of the conference.
<BR>
<P><P>GENERAL INFORMATION
<BR>
<P>Visas
<BR>
<P>Visas are not required for citizens of most American and European
<BR>
countries.  If you are uncertain about whether you need a visa,
<BR>
contact the local British consulate for information.
<BR>
<P>Getting to Anguilla
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;From North America, Anguilla is usually reached via San Juan (Puerto
<BR>
Rico).  From Europe, the best connections are via
<BR>
St. Maarten/St. Martin (from Amsterdam or Paris), or Antigua (from
<BR>
London).  St. Martin is very close to Anguilla and is connected by
<BR>
ferry as well as by plane.
<BR>
<P>Local Transportation
<BR>
<P>The simplest way to get around Anguilla is to rent a car.  You will
<BR>
need to buy an Anguilla drivers license, but this is a formality.
<BR>
Taxis are also available.  Another possibility is to hitch rides from
<BR>
local residents, who are eager to provide them and will often stop to
<BR>
offer rides unsolicited.  Transportation will be provided at specific
<BR>
times between Mariners and the InterIsland hotel.
<BR>
<P>Weather
<BR>
<P>Expect temperatures in the 20's or 30's Celsius, 70's or 80's
<BR>
Fahrenheit.  There is often a strong wind, with cloudbursts that
<BR>
quickly blow over.  Dress code for the conference is shorts and
<BR>
T-shirt.
<BR>
<P>Money
<BR>
<P>The local currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), with an
<BR>
exchange rate of approximately EC$2.7/US$1, but many goods and
<BR>
services in Anguilla, particularly those aimed primarily at tourists
<BR>
(such as restaurants and hotels) are priced in US dollars.  US dollars
<BR>
are freely tradable everywhere on the island, so there is no need to
<BR>
obtain EC dollars before arrival.
