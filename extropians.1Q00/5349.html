<EM>&gt; &gt; But even so the US is not even engaging in economic imperialism.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure the world is our market, but it is also our supplier.  In fact 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;afaik we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have the biggest trade deficit on the planet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I actually agree with you,  but there is something else involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this thread I'm having trouble putting my finger on. Maybe you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help me sort things out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps if we substitute for &quot;imperialism&quot; the word &quot;power&quot; things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might be less muddy.  After all, technically there are no &quot;empires&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the world anywhere at this time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you’re talkin’!  I never really had a problem with the position that the 
<BR>
US is too busy sticking its nose in where it doesn’t belong.  My only point 
<BR>
was that “imperialism” is an untrue and hyperbolic characterization of US 
<BR>
foreign policy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, let's ask the question: can we assign actual centers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power (or control) geographic locations anymore? Does the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power-grid, if any, &quot;float above ground&quot;? Is it an outdated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumption that power centers are governments?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answer to either is &quot;no&quot; then we have to look at how power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IS actually distributed today, and whether the pattern we dis-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cern, if any, is actually significant of anything, or merely an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artifact of history?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I think its fairly clear that power centers are still more or less 
<BR>
geographically located, and that the primary power centers are still 
<BR>
governmental in nature.  Although both these aspects of power are slowly 
<BR>
undergoing fundamental transitions.  Specifically, power is shifting more 
<BR>
and more into resource-fat corporate enterprises and commerical power 
<BR>
brokers.  (Has anyone ever stopped to think how much mayhem Bill Gates could 
<BR>
cause if he *really* wanted to?)
<BR>
<P>I think the distribution of power we see evident today is due both to 
<BR>
specific significant causes and mere historical artifact.  Let’s use the 
<BR>
convenient dichotomy of the “free world” and the rest of the world.  In the 
<BR>
free world, primarily the US, a great deal of power (political and economic) 
<BR>
is derived, I think, precisely from the ideal of freedom.  Free markets, 
<BR>
free enterprise, free thinking and free will lead to innovation, which in 
<BR>
turn leads to any number of technical, strategic and economic advantages.  
<BR>
In the not-so-free world, power over a given nation’s citizens is going to 
<BR>
exist by reason of the historical accident of the state’s mere existence.  
<BR>
But off the top of my head it seems to me that the degree of a nation’s 
<BR>
power in the global community is at least somewhat proportional to the 
<BR>
degree of freedom afforded to that nation’s populace.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, I am currently reading Gregory Stock’s _Metaman_.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067170723X/qid=953451989/sr=1-2/104-2403997-4904450">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067170723X/qid=953451989/sr=1-2/104-2403997-4904450</A>
<BR>
<P>Stock proposes that we humans are merely cellular constituents of a global 
<BR>
superorganism “Metaman” made up of the society of the developed world and 
<BR>
the technical infrastructure which supports it.  In this view there is no 
<BR>
real world power save that of the organism itself, and the various 
<BR>
governmental entities are but mere vital organs of this emerging global 
<BR>
entity.  If this is a legitimate viewpoint, saying that the US is 
<BR>
imperialist is akin to saying that your heart or your liver is exercising 
<BR>
imperial authority over the rest of your body.  Whaddya think?
