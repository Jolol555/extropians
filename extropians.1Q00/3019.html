Sasha &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sasha1@netcom.com?Subject=Re:%20Extropian%20finder%20service?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002172121.OAA09025@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">sasha1@netcom.com</A>&gt; asked:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Could we create a searchable database of extropians
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this idea dovetails with my desire to create an online
<BR>
database of all extropian members tied in with the extropy portal.
<BR>
Whenever someone joins extropy, even if only a free membership, we'd
<BR>
create an entry for them in the database.  We could provide a password
<BR>
protected way for members to updated various information fields
<BR>
associated with their entry via the web.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could allow members to do various kinds of searches for
<BR>
just such purposes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each person would be assigned a permanent extropian ID.  Max
<BR>
would probably get ID #1, and various other long time extropians would
<BR>
be given low id numbers based on when they started to get involved in
<BR>
the extropian movement.  We'd dole out successive id's as new people
<BR>
signed up for the first time.  Smaller IDs and earlier join dates
<BR>
would be more prestigious.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd keep a history of all contributions that person had ever
<BR>
made to the extropy movement.  Information as to whether a person's
<BR>
paying membership had expired or not could be obtained from this.  (Of
<BR>
course some of these fields would be set up not to be changeable by
<BR>
the owner of the record, except by actually making dues payments and
<BR>
so on and so forth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm working on the new extropian books list interface.  I'd
<BR>
like to allow people with paying extropy memberships the ability to
<BR>
&quot;vote&quot; on what books they think should be on (and in what order) a
<BR>
dynamic composite extropian book list for the extropian book store.
<BR>
In order to do this I must have a database of paid up extropian users
<BR>
to allow them update access to their own &quot;voting&quot; book lists.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got the MySQL database, java servlets... set up on the
<BR>
extropy portal for just such purposes.  I'm moving in this direction
<BR>
with all this but it's going to take a while for me to do it all
<BR>
alone.  If anyone else has any ideas (Max, how could I get and
<BR>
maintain a list of paid up extropian members?) or if anyone wants to
<BR>
help out with such an effort that would sure be great!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think such a system would be a great resource for the
<BR>
extropian community for these ans many other reasons.  What do you all
<BR>
think?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
