Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooibos tea (RT) extract contains natural antioxidants and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scavenging agents. We investigated the effects of different concentrations of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;RT extract in medium on growth and changes of growth parameters of cultured
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;chick embryonic skeletal muscle cells. Presence of 2, 10 and 100% of RT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;extract in the culture of primary cells significantly inhibited cell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proliferation. The inhibition of cell growth reflected on decreased DNA, RNA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and protein contents in primary cell culture and fibroblasts and myoblasts.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the primary cells, fibroblasts and myoblasts to synthesize DNA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and protein in the presence of RT extract, measured as an amount of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporated into DNA and de novo synthesized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protein, corresponded with decreasing DNA and protein contents in all three
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cell types. The inhibition effect of RT rose with increasing concentration of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the tea extract in the culture medium. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly affected only by 100% RT extract in every examined cell types.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of RT extract on the growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of primary cells, fibroblasts and myoblasts is due to the potent scavenging
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;activity of the RT extract.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective effects of Rooibos tea (RT), Aspalathus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;linearis, against damage to the central nervous system (CNS) accompanying
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aging were examined by both the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA) and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in brains of chronically RT-treated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rats. Ad libitum administration of RT was begun with 3-month-old Wistar
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;female rats and continued for 21 months. The contents of TBA reactive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;substances (TBARS) in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cerebellum in 24-month-old rats after administration with water were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly higher than those in young rats (5 weeks old). However, no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significant increase of TBARS was observed in RT-administered aged rats. When
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MR images of the brains of 24-month-old rats with and without RT as well as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5-week-old rats were taken, a decrease of the signal intensity was observed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in MR images of aged rats
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;without RT, whereas little change of the signal intensity was observed in MR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;images of the same regions of 24-month-old rats treated with RT, whose images
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were similar to those of young rats. These observations suggested that (1)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in the brain was closely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;related to the morphological changes observed by MRI, and (2) chronic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;RT-administration prevented age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;several regions of rat brain.
