<P><EM>&gt; McVeigh was thrown out of a militia meeting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  because of his views, and he was never a member. Buford was a nazi, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a militia member.

MacVeigh trained with the Michigan Militia.  Bufford had ties with Ole Rev 
<BR>
Butler's ladies club Hayden Lake, Idaho (Hating Lake?) Think that there's no 
<BR>
connection with them and some militias? Think again.

<P><EM>&gt;Who, the greenies? I beleive it.

Greens have yet to successfully produce a single watt of electricty. I am not 
<BR>
unsure if Amory Lovins count as Greens? But his advice has surely saved 
<BR>
electricity and money and still got the job done industrially.
