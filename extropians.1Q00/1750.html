<EM>&gt; Yes, but wouldn't it be true to say that, by hypothesis, Freud observed

<P>Hello Damien,
<BR>
<P>Your question goes to the heart of Freudian &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and
<BR>
deserves a correspondingly substantial answer.
<BR>
<P>My inclination is to invite any member who is truly expert on
<BR>
Freudian theory to make this effort. The Eros-Thanatos scheme
<BR>
was a relatively late development in his thinking and probably
<BR>
reflects the influence of both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.
<BR>
<P>I will restrict myself here to one observation, and wait a bit
<BR>
to see if someone else might not do a much better job than
<BR>
I can in addressing your subtle question.
<BR>
<P>In terms of this later theory, &quot;everything human&quot; is to some
<BR>
relative degree both &quot;eroticised&quot; and &quot;thanatized&quot;; the crucial
<BR>
factor in any case would be an &quot;E/T Ratio&quot;. I add only that
<BR>
the &quot;Thanatotic&quot; wish was an extension of his earlier theory
<BR>
of aggression. Presumably the most mature level of develop-
<BR>
ment, the &quot;Genital&quot;, resolves the &quot;polymorphously perverse&quot;
<BR>
confusion of these trends during the &quot;Anal&quot; sadomasochistic
<BR>
phase.  Parenthetically , keep in mind his concept of defensive
<BR>
&quot;sublimation&quot; in which process any drive or wish is &quot;civilized&quot;.
