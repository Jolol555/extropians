Nah, That's the definition of weasel-worded hairsplitting.  Big diff.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The REAL Definition of &quot;IS&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, most people have heard this quote out of context.  The way this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sound bite was spread around, it sounds ludicrous..  The actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interrogation was much more logical and lawyerly legalistic.  Not to defend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clinton, but just to provide &quot;the rest of the story....&quot;.  (These are gross
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paraphrases from my memory, not real quotes, but the meaning is the same.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prosecutor:  From the previous court transcript, you were asked &quot;Is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any affair with Ms. Lewinski?&quot;  To which you answered, &quot;No, there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affair with Ms. Lewinski.&quot;  In a later deposition, when reviewing that same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question,  you admitted that there was an affair at one time with Ms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lewinski.  Doesn't this prove that you committed perjury, and didn't you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admit to it while under oath to tell the truth?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; President:  Not at all.  The answer to the question depends on what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition of the word &quot;is&quot; is.  If you take the word to mean its proper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; English meaning of present-tense existence, then my answer was correct.  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time the question was first asked, my involvement with Ms. Lewinski had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long been terminated.  I could not say &quot;There is an affair&quot;, because that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been untrue.  I could only say &quot;There was an affair&quot;.  That would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been true, but that question was never asked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prosecutor:  Weren't you sworn to tell the truth, including the whole truth?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; President:  Yes, but only in response to questions asked of me.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defendant is required under law to answer questions that have not been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prosecutor:  Then why did you expand your answer to admit to an earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affair when you were asked the identical question at a later deposition?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; President:  The question was reinterpreted.  Although the question was read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of the prior transcript so that it would be the same question again, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was instructed to interpret the word &quot;is&quot; to also include all past-tense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occurrences as well.  This was a different interpretation of the question,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since I had not previously interpreted the word &quot;is&quot; to be a past-tense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verb.  The reinterpreted question now asked if I currently had or ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previously had an affair with Ms. Lewinski.  I answered that question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truthfully.  I said &quot;At one time there was an affair with Ms. Lewinski.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Presently, there is no affair with Ms. Lewinski.&quot;  Both answers were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truthful and complete.  The change was in the redefinition of the question,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not in a redefinition of my answer.
