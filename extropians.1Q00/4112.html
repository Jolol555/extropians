<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Very interesting comments.  As I understand, the Japanese government and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; academia saw the promise in nanotech long before the United States did 
</EM><BR>
and 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; funded appropriately.  And so a hidden major reason for the Clinton 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; administration's generous funding of nano research is to deal with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; foreign competition!  Competition can be a good thing, eh?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Also, they realise they need technology to stay alive - the Home
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Islands are resource-poor, with a rapidly aging population and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dependent on overseas resources. Anything that can make them more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  efficient, self-sufficient and able to uphold their high standard of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  living will be pursued. On the other hand, my impression of Japanese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  research is that it is often either very applied or very blue sky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  visionary; it seems there is a gap in the middle that might seriously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hinder development.
</EM><BR>
<P>That gap is caused, IMHO, by a relative lack of high-risk entrepreneurialism. 
<BR>
&nbsp;History has shown that the most efficient link between blue-sky research and 
<BR>
concrete, near-term applications is the energy of risky, individualistic 
<BR>
entrepreneurialism, empowered by the swift creation of very flexible networks 
<BR>
that can quickly bridge gaps between previously isolated social groups, 
<BR>
institutions and individuals.  This is precisely what Japanese society seems 
<BR>
to find hard to do, and what the West (especially the United States) is 
<BR>
proving itself extremely adept at.  Note that two Japanese institutions that 
<BR>
have been among the most successful at implementing and exploiting 
<BR>
innovation, Honda and Sony, are both perceived by mainstream Japanese 
<BR>
business society as being &quot;mavericks&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; I do also worry about China.  I hope they can learn to live peaceably 
</EM><BR>
with 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the rest of their global neighbors.  I think of China like an adolescent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; male who was pushed around alot by neighborhood bullies who have since 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; grown 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; up and matured emotionally.  But the victim of this is still carrying a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; grudge and wants to kick some butt to prove his place in the 
</EM><BR>
neighborhood. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The question is, can we guide this lad of one billion people to that 
</EM><BR>
state 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of societal maturity without a major hot or cold war??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Neighbourhood bully? China is much more than somebody who has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bullied by stronger neighbours - for most of its history it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the reverse. I think *that* is the problem - as long as the Beijing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  government see themselves as rulers of an Empire with a manifest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  destiny to be great, they will collide with everyone else. Note the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tremendous benefits Japan or Germany (or Sweden in the 16th century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for that matter) have reaped from turning the energy spent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  nationalist expansionism into other pursuits.
</EM><BR>
<P>My study of Chinese history is completely consistent with this observation.  
<BR>
For 2500 years, Confucian Chinese civilization perceived itself as the 
<BR>
self-sufficient and unchallenged pinnacle of human achievement, a self-image 
<BR>
that was largely justified by experience.  The repeated military and 
<BR>
political defeats at the hands of Western powers in the final 100 years of 
<BR>
Imperial Chinese history was an aberration that caused a deep &quot;identity 
<BR>
crisis&quot; among Chinese intellectuals that made them susceptible to infection 
<BR>
by Western memes like state-nationalism and Marixism-Leninism.  It is 
<BR>
possible to perceive the current state of China's cultural evolution as one 
<BR>
in which it is dealing with the aftermath of these infections.  In the broad 
<BR>
sweep of Chinese history, it is too early to say how the cultural metabolism 
<BR>
of the Sinitic world will re-establish it's own unique equilibrium, but the 
<BR>
best bet is that it will.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  As for China, I don't know. On one hand it has such tremendous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  potential, a booming economy, many cultural memes which could work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  well with transhumanism and sheer size to become the major power of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  this century. But on the other hand, it could break down if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Beijing people cannot handle the transition, and then we get a Balkan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with a billion people involved.
</EM><BR>
<P>Never underestimate the power of Chinese historical and cultural archetypes.  
<BR>
The Confucian world-view was formed in the context of the &quot;Warring States&quot; 
<BR>
period and there is a repeating pattern of what we might (probably 
<BR>
mistakenly) call &quot;balkanization&quot; in inter-dynastic periods throughout the 
<BR>
long period of Imperial history.  The main reason I would reject a simple 
<BR>
expectation of a Western model of &quot;balkanization&quot; in China is the 
<BR>
extraordinary cultural homogeneity established by over two millennia of 
<BR>
Confucian cultural hegemony.  Consider the cultural context of the original 
<BR>
Western pattern of the concept of balkanization, which is an unassimilated 
<BR>
brew of ultimately irreconcilable cultural islands intermixed with each 
<BR>
other.  This context doesn't exist in Sinitic civilization, which is 
<BR>
dominated by Confucian memes in a way that makes christianity's hold over the 
<BR>
West look weak in comparison.
