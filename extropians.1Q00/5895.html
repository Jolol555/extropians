<EM>&gt; &gt; Michael is correct here.  My exhausted state and my zeal conspired to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compell me to make a false statement.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On the practical side, what do you [anyone] think about the impact of
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; poor man's macroengineering project?  Would it be a net gain or loss for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people living there and in adjoining regions?  What would its impact be
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; global climate and ecology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course it would take a weather/climate simulation to come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct answers,
</EM><BR>
<P>Really?:)  Duh!  But seriously, even though I've quoted people who've
<BR>
developed such models -- on this list no less! -- I'm not sure about any
<BR>
such models' ability to do so.  Still, I guess it can't hurt, but it might
<BR>
attract attention, especially if you have to get time on some of the
<BR>
supercomputers... or does what seti@home is doing, which might even get more
<BR>
attention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but I would imagine that having a couple thousand more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; square kilometers of open water in Africa at that latitude would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely make the region less arid, and would also cool it down a bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>One would think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Add the Congo project as well, and you will have a major heat sink where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would do the most good.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would stay away from the Congo project for two reasons.  One, it would
<BR>
cost a lot.  Two, the region is extremely politically unstable right now and
<BR>
probably will remain so for the next few years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since the Sahara induced windflows are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; major engine for the North Atlantic hurricane system, I think it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely change the dynamic there, though whether for the good or bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is questionable. Of the fifty most severe hurricanes of the 20th century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (energy, velocity, size, wave action, etc), 35 occured BEFORE 1950. Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the deforestation peripheral to the Sahara (therefore adding to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heat engine of that body) has occured SINCE 1950, you get the picture...
</EM><BR>
<P>Correlation or cause?  I guess we can test it out.:)
