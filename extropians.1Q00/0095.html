&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, the world is a stage, and they are merely players.  But
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I subscribe neither to the view that social behavior is necessarily
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theatrical, nor the view that human life is a performing art. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Shakespeare made that meme - yes, but not many of us (sociapaths aside)
<BR>
*literally* consider life a game, or a farce or a play. It is a metaphor, a
<BR>
parable... to say that we are players implies that we should not take life so
<BR>
fr**kin seriously, no?
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;&lt; I do mean that I do not engage in role-playing as a means of social
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;interaction; but in my opinion you confuse role-playing with ethics,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;customs, manners and conventions.
<BR>
<P>No, i do not confuse them, thought they are here inter-mingling.
<BR>
A role can be how one behaves, and one can follow conventional roles or
<BR>
unconventional one. It can be chosen, or it can be forced upon one through
<BR>
family or peers. From what I understand of your post, you are striving to not
<BR>
play roles *inflicted* on you by others. Then - if you consistantly forgo
<BR>
all roles - you are playing a role of the &quot;unroleful one&quot; ; )
<BR>
<P><P><EM>   &gt;&gt;If this very real difference is
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observed, then I can also say I DO engage in ethics, customs,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;manners and conventions as a means of social interaction.
<BR>
<EM>   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. Doing that certainly will make your life path less bumpy.
<BR>
&lt;&lt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that others to IDENTIFY me, i.e. decide who I am, by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;using socially-provided generic role-concepts, vocational stereotypes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personality models or gender icons they simply confuse me with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;something else.  Whenever appropriate, I earnestly strive to help them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;correct their misunderstanding.
<BR>
<EM>   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
Again, it may be semantics we are arguing over, but it seems to me thatyou do
<BR>
not object to accepting self appointed roles ( a given task, certain
<BR>
predetermined paths of repeated action that interact one's environment in and
<BR>
over time)** - again, you just don't want OTHERS to determine your roles for
<BR>
you.
<BR>
<P><P>(* Example of a role: accepting the *role* of a father - which is quite
<BR>
different from becoming a father, which requires no commitment)
