<EM>&gt; This fragment from Mike's post brings something to mind. Amara Graps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recently posted a reference to William Calvin's website at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://WilliamCalvin.com/">http://WilliamCalvin.com/</A>  That has a link to his Atlantic Monthly article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Great Climate Flip-flop&quot; which says that the climate system has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential for sudden (over a decade) temperature drops, which could give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe a Siberian climate. The unstable mechanism is the Gulf Stream current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which acts as a conveyor belt carrying warm water to northern Europe and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving them much warmer weather than they would otherwise have. It has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flipped to other modes in the past and apparently could do so again. Melting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Greenland ice cap sounds to me like a pretty substantial nudge.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's been some really good research that indicates that the current 
<BR>
situation in europe weather wise, along with el nino and the general 
<BR>
temperate climate warming is at least partly the result of the rise of 
<BR>
the Himalayan range, however the primary influence still seems to be the 
<BR>
Malenkovich orbit cycles, which seems to predice the end of the &quot;Little
<BR>
Ice Age&quot; 
<BR>
and the current warming trend rather well, according to Drew. He says 
<BR>
that the results he and others have gotten back from cores of ancient
<BR>
&nbsp;glacial ice in Antarctica (8-22 million years old) as well as the more
<BR>
recent glacial 
<BR>
ice in Greenland and the coastal areas of Antarctica track very well
<BR>
with 
<BR>
the Malenkovich predictions of climate change.
