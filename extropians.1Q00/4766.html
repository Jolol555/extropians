<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Not at the expense of rational discourse about the real problems and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;solutions- if gun rights activists are painted as violent antisocial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;irrational paranoid maniacs (the general drift of that cartoon), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;makes it difficult to calmly analyze the situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Political satire is long recognized as a valuable tool in the social tool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kit.  However I don't think there is any danger of cartoons preventing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational discourse among those who prefer to seek it out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is neither
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had called the NRA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational paranoid maniacs,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *that* would be pejorative.  If my quoted phrase offends your sensibilities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would suggest that you are ill prepared to engage in any passionate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since there are more people in the US than guns, then it is hardly a statement
<BR>
of fact. Since there are more people in the world than guns in the world, it is
<BR>
also not a statement of fact. A statement of fact would be,&quot;an organization that
<BR>
fights to maintain every law abiding American's right to own as many or as few
<BR>
guns as they wish.&quot; That would be a statement of fact as well as
<BR>
non-inflammatory.
