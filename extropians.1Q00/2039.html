No offense taken or intended, I believe, I am just trying to focus on the 
<BR>
real, rather then the ideal; which seemed to be where your critique was 
<BR>
situated. As for 'exotic' power sources, I am all for them-as long as they 
<BR>
can actuually work and people want to buy the energy they produce; including 
<BR>
biofuel, fusion, solar, PowerSats, strange matter-whatever.  As you already 
<BR>
seem to know there is so much smoke and mirrors in anticipating future 
<BR>
trends; that a more tactile approach is salutory-hence my focus on natural 
<BR>
gas and wind. These seem to be the only real brightspots, in an otherwise 
<BR>
gloomy energy outcome.
<BR>
<P>Methane-would not necessarilly be the fuel for your engine or fuel cell-but 
<BR>
merely the source, i.e. fuels derived from methane.  Wind Power has been a 
<BR>
decent success in europe and is making Pacific Gas and Electric some real 
<BR>
valuta. Would that it were true for Drexlerian blacktop roads using nano to 
<BR>
illuminate civilization, or or Uncle Arthur's Zero-point energy, in a can. 
<BR>
Sigh!

<P><EM>&gt; I don't follow you. I was being silly about methane, and explaining some

<EM>&gt;  genuine drawbacks of wind. You announce they are the growing-est. Great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for them--vote with your wallet. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Then you lose me. Things cost what they cost. Costs change over time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  don't want a methane powered car badly enough to build one. I like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sailboats a lot, but they're very expensive, specialized vehicles.

<EM>&gt;  Ground-floor apartment dwellers in tightly-packed suburbs don't get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  put up windmills, no matter how much they want to. That's real world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stuff too. You don't have to visit Tomorrowland. You don't have to ride
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in one of the Mad Hatter's teacups, either. I am selective about &quot;early
