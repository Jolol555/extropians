<EM>&gt; &gt; I headed off the issue of &quot;playing god&quot;. I said, (paraphrasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; myself as it's been a while) &quot;Some people would accuse me of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'playing god' but I disagree. To play god, I would have to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; energy into existence from nothing and form that into matter. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to wait a few billion years for that to become life. I'd have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to wait a few more billion years for that life to become human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beings.  Frankly, I don't have time to 'Play God', I'd rather just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use what's already here.&quot;

<EM>&gt; Beautiful! You sound like a very good debater.

<P>Thanks, I try to do my part when I can. I had a forensics teacher in college who
<BR>
thought I was a natural. Only I wasn't allowed to debate with the team. I would
<BR>
had to have been able to travel to other schools for eligibility. Being disabled
<BR>
I was only able to travel in my own vehicle (the school's was not accessible). I
<BR>
was not allowed because the school's insurance did not cover other than school
<BR>
property. I couldn't even sign a waiver and provide my own insurance. So they
<BR>
nor I was ever able to see just how good a debater I might be. &lt;sigh&gt; Guess I
<BR>
lost the debate with them, huh? ;)
