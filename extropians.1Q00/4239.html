We need people who have theological training to develop a whole theological 
<BR>
basis (in several religions) for extropic concepts, and get them promoted in 
<BR>
both the religious and mainstream press. Once this is in place, the 
<BR>
reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to the theological 'high ground', and 
<BR>
they will be seen for what they truly are: oppressive luddites.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is an interesting thought.  It's good to understand where the other 
<BR>
person's perspective on things so you can better communicate with at least 
<BR>
the possibility of making a positive connection.
<BR>
<P>By having knowledgeable and compassionate individuals trained for what you 
<BR>
desire, it would be possible to gain positive impressions from their 
<BR>
memberships.  This way, especially in a roundtable discussion, you will 
<BR>
develop goodwill rather then animosity.
<BR>
<P>But you may be going to far in saying that the theological &quot;highground&quot; will 
<BR>
be at least partially taken to the point where religious leaders will be 
<BR>
seen as oppressive luddites!  If they are really against a certain thing 
<BR>
they will demand membership to &quot;close ranks&quot; and rally round interpretations 
<BR>
of core doctrines.  They are the religious leader in touch with God 
<BR>
according to their group and not you, and so they can do this.
<BR>
<P>I would rather not have this happen because of a &quot;us vrs. them&quot; mentality 
<BR>
where people are labeled and then treated in a certain way.  This has 
<BR>
already been discussed extensively on the list.  We may not be able to 
<BR>
control their actions but we can control our reactions.  Being understanding 
<BR>
and level-headed in public forums will take transhumanist views much 
<BR>
farther.  I think Max and Natasha are good examples of trying to do this in 
<BR>
the mass media.  And for now, they along with Robert Bradbury, Nick Bostrom 
<BR>
and a few others, are the one's who are dealing head-on with these issues 
<BR>
and doing the best they can.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
