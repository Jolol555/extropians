<EM>&gt; So, where do you draw the line and for what application of the rules within a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system? Is the person that you were yesterday &quot;less of a human being&quot; than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are today? Where do children fit along the continuum, not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other species that are significantly related humans? What is the *objective*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criteria that can be used to lay down the threshold line that says: On this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side you are not &quot;human&quot; and over on this side you are? I think this issue is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot more complicated than your summary posting would indicate. Hence the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controversy associated with abortion, animal rights, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never said it wasn't complicated.  I agree, and I think it is so
<BR>
complicated in fact that there are no objective criteria one can use
<BR>
to define the point at which one might attach such things as human
<BR>
rights, or even where one might define such things as sentience or
<BR>
sapience (another few hundred years of philosophy might start to make
<BR>
a dent).  Was I less of a human being yesterday than I am today?
<BR>
Yes, absolutely.  Where do children fit?  I am inclined to think that
<BR>
there is more valuable information content in a toddler than in, say,
<BR>
a dog; but that an old ape might have more than a newborn infant.
<BR>
Similarly, I don't see that there's any bright line of sapience that
<BR>
separates humans from other primates or cetaceans or even dogs--just
<BR>
vague matters of degree.
<BR>
<P>But such complexity and subjectivity is no reason to give up on
<BR>
making choices and judgments.  Humans are very talented at making
<BR>
judgments, and we should do so.  I happen to think that it is a good
<BR>
idea to grant some basic rights to infants, more to adults, none to
<BR>
early fetuses, insects, and microbes, and very few to late-term
<BR>
fetuses and to some non-human animals.  Can I point to exact
<BR>
quantitative reasons for those opinions?  No.  They are just
<BR>
judgments, based on some of the things I know either quantitatively
<BR>
or qualitatively, but I still think they are reasonable judgments.
<BR>
