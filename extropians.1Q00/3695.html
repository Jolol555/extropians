<P>
Robert I know its a sin to post what you sent offlist,
<BR>
but there did not appear to be anything too personal
<BR>
in it, and I cut anything that you might want kept between
<BR>
us guys.  Evidently theres something wrong with your
<BR>
aol account, as I tried this message twice and it bounced
<BR>
twice.
<BR>
<P>Now with that said, I will further comment that I have
<BR>
had chronic problems sending to some aol accounts:
<BR>
yours and EvMick's are two notorious examples.  The
<BR>
only time I get messages bounced are when I am sending
<BR>
to an aol account.  This is unsettling, considering their
<BR>
recent purchase of Time-Warner.  Perhaps the fault is
<BR>
on my end.

<P>Its in there, but if you havent seen that post, do spare
<BR>
yourself Robert.  I was having a bad week.  {8-]  See what
<BR>
happens when you go outta town?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And what happened to Kellie Martin?
</EM><BR>
<P>They killed her character, the bastards.  I dont know why they
<BR>
couldnt have just made her go crazy or something, so she
<BR>
could come back occasionally,  at least, even perhaps as
<BR>
a chronic psych patient.  {8-[
<BR>
<P>I think Im gonna give up ER, or certainly during the times
<BR>
I am suffering emotional storms.   I have three friends who are
<BR>
ER doctors, and all three dislike the show, for one reason
<BR>
or another, but one common theme is that they say the
<BR>
show is vaaaastly overdramatized.  The majority of the
<BR>
patients they see are those who are too lazy to get a regular
<BR>
doctor, or are welfare cases.  In the ER, there is very little
<BR>
paper work to suffer thru, compared to the other free
<BR>
health care that is available.
<BR>
<P>My ER worker friends agree that if serious cases came thru
<BR>
the door at the pace indicated on the show, every doctor
<BR>
and nurse would crack within a year.  spike
