<P>FDA TO HOLD SPECIAL HEARING 
<BR>
Foundation Supporters In Washington DC Area Urged to Attend 
<BR>
<P>The FDA has been overwhelmed by demands from Congress, the Courts and the
<BR>
people to abide by the First Amendment as it relates to dietary supplement
<BR>
health claims. 
<BR>
<P>In response, the FDA is holding a public meeting on April 4, 2000 from
<BR>
10:00 am to 6:00 pm at the Department of Education, Barnard Auditorium
<BR>
(Federal Building 6),400 Maryland Ave SW, Washington, DC. This building is
<BR>
one block east of the L'Enfant Metro Station. (Maryland Ave. exit) 
<BR>
<P>The purpose of this meeting is to discuss implementation of health claims
<BR>
ordered by a Federal Appellate Court in the First Amendment lawsuit
<BR>
victory won by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw against the FDA on January 15,
<BR>
1999. The FDA is seeking public comment on whether dietary supplements can
<BR>
have disease-specific treatment claims attached, or if they are to be
<BR>
limited only to disease risk reduction. If you have any grievances you
<BR>
would like to redress to the FDA, this is your opportunity. 
<BR>
<P>To attend the meeting, you must complete the registration form at the end
<BR>
of this article and fax or mail it to Carole A. Williams, Office of
<BR>
Consumer Affairs, FDA, 5600 Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FDA
<BR>
encourages you to fax this information to them at: 301-827-3052. You can
<BR>
phone them at 301-827-4421 for additional information. 
<BR>
<P>The FDA says you must send them your registration by March 28, a ploy we
<BR>
believe is designed to preclude most people from being able to participate
<BR>
in this public hearing. We urge all Foundation members to make an effort
<BR>
to attend this important event. If the FDA tries to deny you access, you
<BR>
should state that your Constitutional civil rights will be violated if
<BR>
they do not allow you to attend this public hearing to determine what
<BR>
types of health claims you are allowed to hear under the First Amendment.
<BR>
The FDA's failure to allow citizens access to this meeting to discuss
<BR>
these critically important First Amendment issues will in effect, be still
<BR>
another overt act by the FDA to suppress free access to information by the
<BR>
public. 
<BR>
<P>The FDA has only given a one-week notice to apply to attend to this
<BR>
meeting, which is unusually short. It's obvious the FDA would like to be
<BR>
able to tell Congress that the public has no interest in this area. When
<BR>
we tried faxing the FDA's special reservation line today, it did not pick
<BR>
up. We encourage all those who are going to attend to bring cameras and
<BR>
tape recorders to document any attempt by the FDA to deny the public
<BR>
access the this hearing. 
<BR>
<P>Please forward this alert to anyone you know in the Washington, D.C. area
<BR>
who might want to attend, or submit written comments. For complete
<BR>
details, please check out the Home Page of our Website (www.lef.org) 
<BR>
<P>What follows is a summary of this meeting from the FDA along with a
<BR>
registration application: 
<BR>
<P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public meeting to
<BR>
solicit comments on two topics pertaining to health claims in dietary
<BR>
supplement labeling. The first topic concerns implementation of the recent
<BR>
court of appeals decision in Pearson v. Shalala (Pearson). In Pearson, the
<BR>
U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that FDA's decision not to
<BR>
authorize four health claims for dietary supplements violated the First
<BR>
Amendment because the agency did not consider whether the claims, which
<BR>
failed to meet the ``significant scientific agreement'' standard of
<BR>
evidence by which the health claims regulations require FDA to evaluate
<BR>
the scientific validity of claims, could be rendered non-misleading by
<BR>
adding qualifying language. The second topic on which we are requesting
<BR>
comments is whether claims about an effect on an existing disease may be
<BR>
made as health claims, or whether such claims should subject the product
<BR>
to regulation as a drug. We are holding this meeting to give the public an
<BR>
opportunity to provide information and views on these topics. 
<BR>
<P>DATES: The meeting will be held on April 4, 2000, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
<BR>
Please register by close of business, March 28, 2000. Late registrations
<BR>
will be accepted contingent on space availability. Submit written comments
<BR>
by April 19, 2000. 
<BR>
<P>ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at Department of Education, Barnard
<BR>
Auditorium (Federal Building 6), 400 Maryland Ave., SW., Washington, DC.
<BR>
Building entrances are located on the Maryland Ave., SW. and C Street, SW.
<BR>
between 4th and 6th Streets, SW. Federal Building 6 is one block east of
<BR>
the L'Enfant METRO Subway Station's Maryland Ave. exit. Submit written
<BR>
comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug
<BR>
Administration, rm. 1061, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852. You may
<BR>
