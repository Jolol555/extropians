<EM>&gt; &gt; You've missed my point entirely. I have read any and everything I can on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; jacking in, etc. Thanks for giving me a couple titles, but...  Most of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; read sci-fi. I want to know what THE LIST envisions their OWN personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experience of uploading, not what sci-fi authors think. I believe it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; valuable to do so *on list* since this is the pool of talent that is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inherently prone towards researching and making such a thing possible --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exactly NOT as fiction, but as their own reality. I even know people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; studying neuroscience to help it happen!!
</EM><BR>
<P>I look forward to finally having actual communication with my fellows.  
<BR>
Email is OK, face to face conversation is (sometimes) better, but let's face 
<BR>
it -- real communication will only come when you can partake in another's 
<BR>
thoughts, feelings and emotions.  Maybe it's that personally I have never 
<BR>
been a great interpersonal relationship kind of guy.  Too often what I 
<BR>
intend as good natured irony comes across as mean-spirited or &quot;reactionary.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife is the archetypal emotional woman and I know to her I am the 
<BR>
archetypal logical male.  True communication in my household comes only with 
<BR>
truly heroic effort.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to sharing the collective experience of all humanity and 
<BR>
finally breaking past the walls of emotional, experiential and temperamental 
<BR>
difference which separate us.  One of the benefits I expect to come from 
<BR>
having access to a communal consciousness is a truer self-image.  We think 
<BR>
we each know ourselves better than anyone else knows us.  My bet is that the 
<BR>
collective opinion of those people who know us is probably closer to the 
<BR>
truth than our own opinions of ourselves.  One of my main goals in life is 
<BR>
to “know thyself.”  I think I’ll be much further along the path of knowing 
<BR>
who I am when I know who it is my peers think I am, behind all their 
<BR>
misleading social niceties and facades.
<BR>
