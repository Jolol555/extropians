<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Transparency%20(Was%20Re:%20FreeNet%20downside)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000325022501.88216.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mike@datamann.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;If there were no such thing as criminally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; minded people, there would be no need to have this discussion.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact though, is that that is not the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But treating everyone by the standard of the lowest common denominator (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;savage) communicates that there is no value, no benefit to behaving as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizen. If you expect everyone to act the worste possible way, a lot of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will fulfill your expectations. And it will be YOUR fault.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a bit of a cop-out from free will buff like yourself, don't you 
<BR>
think?  If I assume that you are a crook are you going to become a crook?  
<BR>
And if you do is that really *my* fault?  Puh-lease.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sure all people are innocent until proven guilty, I just don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make it a policy to give unknown people the opportunity to prove their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guilt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on me.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However you don't need to know everything about everyone. As work by Robin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hanson and others with Baysean theory shows, you don't need to know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The only people who insist on knowing everything about everyone are those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have the lowest possible opinion of their fellow man. Such people should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered to sick to be allowed to contribute to the development or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implementation of public policy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again you get me wrong.  I recognize that I don't have the capacity to know 
<BR>
everything.  Moreover I have no desire to know everything.  Right now I 
<BR>
could exercize my rights under the FOIA to search through mountains of 
<BR>
government documents.  I have no desire to, so I don't.  My point is not to 
<BR>
give Zero Powers omniscience.  It is to do away with the hoarding of data.  
<BR>
Information wants to be free (yes even your bank records) and I merely want 
<BR>
information to reach its goal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You give untold numbers of people the ability and opportunity to prove 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innocence every day, and they do so in many ways, all the time. That you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to focus on the rare incident and/or minor risk of guilty behavior, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignoring the overwhelming weight of innocent behavior as evidence to attest 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the 'reasonableness' of your proposals indicates that you have some issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like you I want to treat everyone the same.  You want everyone, criminals 
<BR>
and innocent alike, to be able to hide their data and themselves.  I want 
<BR>
everyone, criminals and innocent alike to step out of the shadows.  I'm not 
<BR>
focusing on crime.  I'm focusing on efficiency.  Yes, I do have issues.  My 
<BR>
main issue in this discussion is that the hoarding of data is inefficient, 
<BR>
counter productive and sooner or later will be downright dangerous.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I didn't say that she would dissapear without telling you why, but even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allowed that if she had a damn good reason, then it would be ok.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course it would, based upon the data about her I had access to before she 
<BR>
left.  Why is it so hard for you to grasp that point?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If she told you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;she was going to Jupiter on a NASA mission, with 20 men, for ten years, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would you do then?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ridiculous hypothetical.  My wife would not do that for all the tea in 
<BR>
China, so I can't give any response.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Moreover, once you developed a level of trust in her, from her past record, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acknowledge that it would be ok for her to NOT be under your surveillance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ten years, so you have just given up your insistence of total surveillance. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't spy on your wife at work, do you? Do you feel you have to? Why? Do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a mental problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, simply because the means of ubiquitous surveillance exists does 
<BR>
not mean that I would necessarily make use of them at all.  And even if I 
<BR>
did it certainly would not occupy the bulk of my day.  Just knowing that 
<BR>
universal surveillance was possible would have the desired effect.
<BR>
<P>And, no as far as I am aware I have no mental problems.  But your 
<BR>
frustration at the difficulty you are having with this argument is once 
<BR>
again leading you down the path of hyperbole and name-calling.  If you 
<BR>
simply can't cut that out, I will have to once again drop another debate 
<BR>
with you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In other words, you trust me to the extent that you've been able to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;surveillance&quot; on me.  Without the information gained regarding my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and my respectable background, you'd have no basis for trusting me, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thank you.  You have made my point better than I could have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No I haven't, because I do not base my judgement on 30 years of utter and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance of your every waking movement, action, and utterance.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are now talking about a matter of *degree*.  No you haven't surveilled 
<BR>
me for 30 years, and your surveillance has not been very thorough or 
<BR>
detailed.  But still to the extent that you trust me (which admittedly is 
<BR>
not very much) it is based upon what you *know* about me.  That, Michael, is 
<BR>
called intelligence, data gathering, knowledge, in a word...surveillance.  
<BR>
Get it??
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;given your history on this list of tending to prefer solutions proposed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;espoused by paranoid , megalomaniacal fascists, my level of trust in you is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and would need to be augmented by countering evidence that you are only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;playing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;devils advocate, etc...
</EM><BR>
<P>More name calling.  Come on, do a little better than that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Treating all as if they are each the worst possible person is not the way 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;build trust.
</EM><BR>
<P>One more time, with feeling.  MAS does not treat people as if they were good 
<BR>
or bad.  MAS merely assures that people's actions, whether good or bad, will 
<BR>
be recorded.  Virtually every conversation that the U.S. President has is 
<BR>
recorded.  Why do you think that is?  Is it because we as a nation have 
<BR>
decided that our Presidents are all to be treated as if they are the worst 
<BR>
possible person?  Or is it because the actions of our President can have 
<BR>
drastic and far-reaching effects and, as a result, it is important to have 
<BR>
an accurate record?
<BR>
<P>Stop, think, take a deep breath.  Now reply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Again, no.  MAS has nothing to do with the presumption of innocence.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; presume everyone is innocent until proven otherwise.  MAS merely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *verification* of innocence, or the lack thereof.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why do you need verification of innocence unless you don't trust anyone to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innocent? MAS has EVERYTHING to do with the presumption of innocence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've said it as many times as I can say it in as many different ways as I 
<BR>
can.  If you don't get it by now I have to give up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To the common, public, well of information. Haven't you understood the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tragedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the Commons?
</EM><BR>
<P>And how, exactly, does that have anything at all to do with the discussion 
<BR>
at hand?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't care what the government does, so long as it stays out of my life. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treats everyone like I want it to treat me, then there is no need for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Orwellian anarchy.
</EM><BR>
<P>More big and improbable &quot;ifs.&quot;  The government does not treat you the way 
<BR>
you want to be treated.  Virtually every aspect of your life is documented.  
<BR>
Everytime you get a driver's license, everytime you purchase a firearm, 
<BR>
every time you file a tax return, every time you buy anything other than 
<BR>
with cash or a cashier's check, every time you register a vehicle, every 
<BR>
time you apply for a loan or credit of any kind, and on and on and on...it 
<BR>
is *documented.*
<BR>
<P>MAS will not change the fact that your life is documented.  What it will do 
<BR>
though is allow you to know exactly to what extent your life is and has been 
<BR>
documented (which you do not know now) and what is contained in that 
<BR>
documentation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you know my bank records, then you know my account information. If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my biometrics and my PGP keys, then you can impersonate me and steal my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With total mutual surveillance comes the end of not only privacy, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;property,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free speech, free association, and self defense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite.  See, one more time, the key to MAS is *mutuality*.  Whenever I 
<BR>
access your bank records, you will know it.  You will know exactly what I 
<BR>
found out, when I found it out, and what I did with it.  I could not 
<BR>
impersonate you because whatever I did to impersonate you would *also* be 
<BR>
recorded.  You could then follow my trail and watch as I put on my Michael 
<BR>
Lorrey mask, and counterfeited my Michael Lorrey fingerprints.  In a truly 
<BR>
open society there would be no way for me to get away with usurping your 
<BR>
personality, therefore there would be no incentive for me to try, therefore 
<BR>
you would have no cause to be so scared about me perusing your dossier.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With MAS, because everyone will know everything you say, you won't dare say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything that the majority will dissaprove of.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's hogwash.  Are you saying that you don't express yourself now unless 
<BR>
what you have to say is politically correct or you are incognito?  Seems to 
<BR>
me you've got more intestinal fortitude than that.  My opinions regarding 
<BR>
transparency are not approved by the majority, but I have absolutely no 
<BR>
qualms about expressing them (or couldn't you tell?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With MAS, none of your property belongs to you anymore, because everyone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where it is, and when you are not there to watch it, and what your security 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dealt with this above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;WIth MAS, everyone will know with whome you associate, so you will not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;associate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with anyone that is not approved of by the majority.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you are a *real* coward would you let society dictate who you 
<BR>
associate with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With MAS, everyone will know where you are at any given time. A person with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wish to kill does not care about the consequences of that action, if they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where to find you while they are still enraged, they will find you and kill 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you.
</EM><BR>
<P>That applies now.  There's nothing you can do about that.  Chances are 
<BR>
though that anyone who wishes to kill you can already figure out where to 
<BR>
find you.  Its not often that a stranger who has never met you has the 
<BR>
uncontrollable desire to find you and kill you.  The only difference that 
<BR>
MAS will make in this situation is the assurance that the would-be murderer 
<BR>
will not get away with his crime.  Will that discourage *everyone*?  No.  
<BR>
Will it discourage the great majority of sane people with homicidal 
<BR>
tendencies?  Unquestionably.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If the majority decides that you are a politically dangerous individual, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be found, and dissention will end.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are assuming that surveillance equals totalitarianism.  MAS in a free 
<BR>
society does not make it any more likely than now that dissent will end just 
<BR>
because you can be found.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So now what?  I can say &quot;Hey Michael I see you just paid another $200 to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ATF for another machine gun.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And you can say, &quot;Yes, I know that you know that.  And you also know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know you just paid $200 for another bullet-proof vest, but that wouldn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you much good if I decided to use my armor-piercing bullets on you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And then I could say, &quot;Perhaps, but since I follow you around with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ubiquitous public surveillance camera network, I would know the minute 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; left your house with your machine gun and I could follow you as you got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; closer and closer to my house.  As soon as you got within 100 feet of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; front door, I'd alert the AI police chief who would be ready to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incapacitate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you with the nano-police the second you pointed your gun at me and put 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; finger on the trigger.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And then you could say &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right.  So I won't kill you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; today.  Hey wanna go check out a football game?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which merely illustrates the depth to which your paranoia has developed.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're about 3 straws away from the last one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine gun technology has been around since the 19th century, and it has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the least commonly used gun technology in crime, while there are over 200k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;private owners. This record indicates that, by definition, a person who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;owns a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine gun is not very likely to commit a crime with it, and is therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trustworthy. All your surveillance of me does is feed your paranoias to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point that you and every other paranoiac start screaming to the government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone needs to be locked up in chains to make the world safe for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paranoiacs.
</EM><BR>
<P>2 straws to go.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Without at least some knowlege, what could there possibly be to base 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; upon?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is your primary problem. You don't, in your heart, assume that anyone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good or innocent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well maybe you are different (and apparently you are) but with me trust and 
<BR>
respect have to be *earned*.  That doesn't mean that I assume every stranger 
<BR>
is untrustworthy or unworthy of respect.  It just means they are a blank 
<BR>
slate.  In my mind you are neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy until you 
<BR>
demonstrate yourself as such.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your insistence that people prove their innocence indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you don't beleive in the presumption of innocence. I do beleive in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goodness, innocence, and trustworthyness of the vast majority of people.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not insisting that anyone prove anything.  I merely maintain that we'll 
<BR>
all be better off when we stop hoarding data.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not prejudge everyone based upon the poor behavior of less than 1% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;population, and I know that if anyone ever does prove me wrong in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;particular instance, I am prepared to deal with that individual, in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance, as they should be dealt with, while I can go on treating everyone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as normal, honest, honorable human beings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great.  Me too.  That has nothing to do with transparency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your problem is paranoia coupled with extreme extroversion, my problem is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;introversion. Since when does your problem become more important than mine?
</EM><BR>
<P>1 straw left.  I am neither paranoid nor extroverted.  But to you point 
<BR>
(such as it is), MAS will not interfere one iota with your introversion.  If 
<BR>
you want to stay huddled in your house surrounded by nothing but your 
<BR>
arsenal, MAS will not force you to do otherwise.  Just because I can find 
<BR>
out where you live does not mean I'll be able to drop by without your 
<BR>
permission.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I really hate slick people. I prefer people who are charming as a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course, not because they have to be...
</EM><BR>
<P>You only like people who are charming 24 hours a day?  Where (other than 
<BR>
yourself of course) have you ever met such a person?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Oh, Brave New World.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Slavery is Freedom......all hail Slavery.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah well whatever.  Hey look at that!  You *still* have 1 straw left! Let's 
<BR>
see how long it lasts.
