<P>
Varying degrees of tyranny is practiced in the world.
<BR>
By tyranny I mean the use of violence or threat of violence
<BR>
by some people to coercively impose their will on others.
<BR>
<P>In order for tyranny to occur, some people must have
<BR>
power over other people. In my opinion, this condition of
<BR>
some people dominating and oppressing others at least
<BR>
partly stems from a mind-set I call the tyrant-paradigm.
<BR>
<P>The tyrant-paradigm can be described as a collection
<BR>
of certain memes that are extropian enemies. They are
<BR>
contrary to the extropian principles of open society and
<BR>
self-direction.
<BR>
<P>I further contend that people can reduce tyranny by removing
<BR>
the tyrant-paradigm from their minds. As long as people's
<BR>
minds remain infected by the tyrant-paradigm they will
<BR>
perpetuate tyranny.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a
<BR>
government or to avoid repairs of a motorcycle because
<BR>
it is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and
<BR>
as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is
<BR>
possible. The true system, the real system, is our present
<BR>
construction of systematic thought itself, rationality
<BR>
itself. And if a factory is torn down but the rationality
<BR>
which produced it is left standing, then that rationality
<BR>
will simply produce another factory. If a revolution
<BR>
destroys a systematic government, but the systematic
<BR>
patterns of thought that produced that government are left
<BR>
intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the
<BR>
succeeding government...&quot;
<BR>
-- Robert Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
<BR>
Maintenance'
<BR>
<P>The tyrant-paradigm consists of the &quot;construction of
<BR>
systematic thought,&quot; &quot;the systematic patterns of thought&quot;
<BR>
that give rise to coercive and tyrannical political systems,
<BR>
to some people being ranked over other people.
<BR>
<P>At a high level of abstraction, I describe the tyrant-paradigm
<BR>
as consisting of certain concepts, ideas words, patterns of
<BR>
thinking, attitudes, and beliefs that give rise to coercive and
<BR>
tyrannical political systems. I see the tyrant-paradigm as
<BR>
one of the most important problems in the world.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is
<BR>
the  mind of the oppressed.&quot;
<BR>
-- Steve Biko
<BR>
<P>Consider the possibility that tyranny is a lot easier to
<BR>
practice if tyrants in some ways &quot;own&quot; the minds of their
<BR>
victims. What if the mind-set I call the tyrant-paradigm
<BR>
effectively enables tyrants in some important ways to
<BR>
&quot;own&quot; the minds of their victims?
<BR>
<P>&quot;It is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your
<BR>
head.&quot;
<BR>
-- Sally Kempton
<BR>
<P>The Tyrant-Paradigm Removal List has been set up
<BR>
to explore all aspects of the tyrant-paradigm and for
<BR>
subscribers to assist each other in removing the
<BR>
tyrant-paradigm from their minds.
<BR>
<P>You'll be amazed by how your personal freedom expands
<BR>
as you remove the tyrant-paradigm from your mind!
<BR>
<P>I invite you to subscribe to the Tyrant-Paradigm Removal List by
<BR>
sending a blank email to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tyrant-paradigm-subscribe@topica.com?Subject=Re:%20Extropian%20Enemy:%20the%20Tyrant-Paradigm&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.2.0.58.20000107110614.0433c4b0@209.150.150.38&gt;">tyrant-paradigm-subscribe@topica.com</A>&gt;,
