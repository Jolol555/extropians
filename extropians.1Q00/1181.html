<P>
Sorry I don't have more time to post on these threads. I feel that I 
<BR>
should, especially since I teach a class in Philosophy of Religion. So, 
<BR>
just a few points made briefly (well, more briefly than I'd like):
<BR>
<P>AGNOSTIC AND ATHEIST:
<BR>
Though I always prefer to describe my views in positive rather than 
<BR>
negative terms, if asked    (about the traditional God) &quot;are you an 
<BR>
atheist&quot;, then my direct answer would be &quot;yes&quot;. I think it is a mistake to 
<BR>
say that you should be an agnostic because you cannot prove that there is 
<BR>
no God. There are many things I cannot prove do not exist. My example in 
<BR>
class: there is an invisible, intangible alien elf who lives on top of the 
<BR>
Empire State Building who uses a mysterious mind control technology to 
<BR>
increase conflicts among people to weaken us ready for an alien invasion. 
<BR>
Do I believe this being exists? No. I am an a-elfist, just as I am an atheist.
<BR>
<P>Atheism = a-theism = lack of belief in a God. Lacking belief does not 
<BR>
automatically imply you can *prove* there is no such thing. While I find it 
<BR>
almost impossible to make sense of the Christian idea of God given the 
<BR>
state of the world, I cannot prove that our universe was not created by 
<BR>
some higher power, perhaps even something much like the Christian/Muslim 
<BR>
God. I just see no positive reason to believe this, many strong reasons to 
<BR>
doubt it, and so lack belief.
<BR>
<P>An agnostic is someone who does not know or thinks they *cannot* know 
<BR>
whether there is a God. To be an agnostic, at least in the second, stronger 
<BR>
sense, you need to have a standard of knowledge. Perhaps a supernatural, 
<BR>
unobservable being may not be the kind of thing of which you can have 
<BR>
knowledge. If so, by your standards of knowledge, you would be an agnostic. 
<BR>
You might then also be an atheist--having no knowledge of something, you 
<BR>
might very reasonably take the default position that you therefore do not 
<BR>
believe. (This is *not* equivalent to denying all possibility of the being 
<BR>
existing.) Or, you might say &quot;I do not know if a God exists, but I choose 
<BR>
to believe anyway&quot;. I think most people do this, though not in such a 
<BR>
conscious form. One example of a conscious, cold-blooded agnostic theism is 
<BR>
Pascal's in his infamous Pascal's Wager.
<BR>
<P>So, logically, you can be an agnostic atheist or an agnostic theist. Theism 
<BR>
is about belief, while &quot;gnosis&quot; refers to knowledge.
<BR>
<P>If you were to ask me about the typical notion of God (a supernatural being 
<BR>
who is omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly good [the last being 
<BR>
tricky--good by what standard...], I would say that I am an atheist and 
<BR>
would *not* be an agnostic. According to my standards of knowledge, I feel 
<BR>
comfortable in saying that I *know* there is no such being. (My standards 
<BR>
of knowledge do not require that I can *prove absolutely* that something 
<BR>
does not exist for me to know that it doesn't.) However, if by &quot;God&quot;, 
<BR>
someone simply means a creator and designer not bound by the laws of 
<BR>
physics, I would be an atheist but also agnostic. I would lack belief 
<BR>
because I see no evidence for this (I don't buy Moravec's idea that it's 
<BR>
highly likely that we are a simulation), but such a view doesn't conflict 
<BR>
with my observations such that I would claim to know that there is no 
<BR>
God/gods. Perhaps we *are* a simulation or creation of a being or beings in 
<BR>
a &quot;dimension&quot; outside ours.
<BR>
<P>ARROGANCE, EMPATHY, PERSUASION
<BR>
I have to confess: Sometimes it's just plain fun to hack away at someone's 
<BR>
religious views. Though I grew out of that long ago, I can see some 
<BR>
possible situations where I might still do it. However, I would not fool 
<BR>
myself into thinking of this as an effective means of persuasion. And I 
<BR>
would only do this to someone who I found thoroughly obnoxious.
<BR>
<P>On the whole, I echo QueenMuse's views that showing understanding and 
<BR>
sympathy (sincerely) works better. I cannot genuinely sympathize with 
<BR>
*some* people's approach to religion (or some aspects of some people's 
<BR>
approach)--such as when it's deliberate ignorance and an excuse for hatred 
<BR>
and bigotry. But I really can sympathize with someone who is trying to make 
<BR>
sense of life, especially when they simply lack the knowledge or reasoning 
<BR>
abilities to know better. My many experiences teaching Philosophy of 
<BR>
Religion have shown me two things:
<BR>
<P>(1) Most students lack the scientific education to evaluate issues such as 
<BR>
evolution vs. creation, or soul vs. physicalist views of the mind, and they 
<BR>
have never learned logic or reasoning skills.
<BR>
<P>(2) Approaching people's beliefs with sympathy, understanding, and respect 
<BR>
combined with rigorous challenging questions, has a far better chance of 
<BR>
altering their views than arrogance, attack, and cold argumentation. It 
<BR>
still amazes me that most of my students, even after three or four months, 
<BR>
do not figure out my religious views. I present the arguments as 
<BR>
objectively as possible and spur them to think for themselves. If they do 
<BR>
this, they usually find that no rationally defensible argument can be found 
<BR>
for belief in the traditional notion of God. (I conclude with a class on 
<BR>
faith, which makes it harder for them to take refuge in that!)  Aside from 
<BR>
this being the professional way to teach this class, I am certain that my 
<BR>
approach, either immediately or over time, gets students to rethink their 
<BR>
views more than a combative approach would. (I have plenty of experience of 
<BR>
the latter from my earlier years as an atheist.) I'm sure it helps that, in 
<BR>
addition to rationally examining central theistic beliefs, I also present 
<BR>
some positive alternatives to making sense of life (humanism and 
<BR>
transhumanism).
<BR>
<P>Okay, this was longer than I intended!
<BR>
<P>Onward!
