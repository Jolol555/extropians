<P>
To have a world of mature nanotech with nanoassemblers in every home  is a 
<BR>
dream of mine.  But I wonder if the government would allow the public direct 
<BR>
access to nano assemblers?  In the cause of preventing terrorism as well as 
<BR>
accidents I could see the governments of the world only allowing direct 
<BR>
access to nano to government and corporate entities.  The ulterior motive 
<BR>
would be to maintain their strong control over society.
<BR>
<P>Or would capitalism and corporate greed be the reason for a nanoassembler in 
<BR>
every home?  And even if so, would these be close to the &quot;anything  boxes&quot; 
<BR>
we hope for?  I would like to think that in the world we are brought back 
<BR>
into (cryonic reanimation) there will be home models that can build houses 
<BR>
and vehicles.
<BR>
<P>Any thoughts?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
