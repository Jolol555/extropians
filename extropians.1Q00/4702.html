<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've seen enough hateful cartoons about the NRA that one more is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;surprise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have a point? Don't even try to start a gun rights flame war with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me. Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; database examined to date (and the most unbiased one). I can also retort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against criminals. Do you really want to continue?

I'm sure you don't wanna continue with ME, mikey, because I 
<BR>
scare you shitless!
