I could almost see it now: extropian children's groups going from door to 
<BR>
door, collecting scrap metal and donations... speaking of which why *aren't* 
<BR>
there any Extro-scouts?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Considering his interest in wilderness adventure, Greg Burch could be the 
<BR>
first Extro-Scout scoutmaster! :)  Doug Jones could be the rocketry merit 
<BR>
badge counselor!  Max More could be the extropian philosopy merit badge 
<BR>
counselor!  Natasha could be the counselor for the artistic aethetics merit 
<BR>
badge!  Robert Bradbury would be counselor for the life extension merit 
<BR>
badge!  Eliezer would be the counselor for the A.I. seed badge!  Spike Jones 
<BR>
would be the space macro-engineering merit badge!  Gina Miller would be the 
<BR>
counselor for the nanotech merit badge!  And on an on....
<BR>
<P>There is such a reserve of talent on this list and I have barely scratched 
<BR>
the surface.  If we all lived close enough to eachother and really wanted 
<BR>
to, we could start a first rate scout troop!  &quot;Oh, no, but they mention God 
<BR>
in scout pledges, I forgot!&quot; lol
<BR>
<P>What would the extro-scout oath be like?  How about the uniforms?  What 
<BR>
other merit badges would we have?  What kind of activities and jamboree's 
<BR>
would be held?  And where?  What would the ranks be like?  I think Aristoi 
<BR>
would have to be the equivalant to Eagle scout! :)
<BR>
<P>I just thought of how we solve all the funding problems for cryonics and 
<BR>
transhuman ventures in general!  We will have cute extro-girlscouts go forth 
<BR>
and sell extroscout cookies!!  Chuck full of neuro-enhancing goodness!! :)
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
