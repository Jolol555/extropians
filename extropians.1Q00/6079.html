<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well the transparency I advocate is mutual, two-way, transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Meaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the individual would be no more subject to surveillance than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; government.  In fact my suggestion is &quot;power equivolent surveillance,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the more power you have to meddle in others lives, the *more* you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; subject to surveillance.  In this scheme, the President and members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; congress would live in a virtual fish bowl and we the people would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to know virtually *everything* about their political, business and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; affairs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I share your enthusiasm for accountability for our elected and appointed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;leaders, however your proposal that they have more surveillance than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;average person runs counter to every security protocol of any leader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;security detail that ever kept its subject alive for more than 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not really.  In fact this sort of power-proportional transparency is already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in effect in some ways.  Right now we can know much more about President
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clinton than he could ever know about you.  I know where and when he travels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abroad.  I know why he has gone there and whom he talked to and what they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talked about.  If I wanted to I could, in a matter of minutes, find out what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his agenda is for next week, where he'll be and what he'll be doing.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact its probably fair to say that Clinton is the *most* surveilled person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the planet, as it should be.  And he has been kept alive by his security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail for a little more than 5 minutes.
</EM><BR>
<P>What he does in public is immaterial. Your proposal would have everyone
<BR>
knowing how he takes a crap, what he says to his little cover-up team
<BR>
members, you will be able to catch him when he or his men are destroying
<BR>
evidence or porking their interns...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; When we have gotten past national sovereignty and moved on to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; democratic global governance, there will be no need for such things as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; secrets and national security.  At that point we will only be concerned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) individual security and (2) global security.  Both of those types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; security would best be served by ubiquitous transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;formation of other corporate structures as well...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big scary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human rights?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its pretty obvious you don't see the holes in your own argument. If
<BR>
there is no government, then there is nothing illegal about corporations
<BR>
amassing their own armies. In fact, your point is bogus, because
<BR>
corporations CAN amass their own armies right now. Corporations can buy
<BR>
any weapon manufactured right now except nukes, and they don't need an
<BR>
ATF background check, and they don't pay a $200.00 transfer tax.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;allowed to become law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Examples, please.  Even if that is the case, that is not what *I* advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (at least not yet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Power corrupts, so why give the power brokers more of it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't advocate that at all.  I propose giving more power to those are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful.  I do propose opening the flood gates of surveillance, but its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; two-way floodgate, and I'd call for more information about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing to the people than the other way around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Since the powerful will have greater computational resources, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be able to make better use of the intelligence value of this ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surveillance, so even if everyone has the same 'access' (or even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;powerful have 'less' access, they will still make better use of the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and will be able to oppress people more as a result. Surveillance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;merely an intelligence gathering channel. Its value is directly related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to how much you can process in a given amount of time, and how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;useless data you can filter out. Unless you are going to mandate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;everyone have exactly the same amount of computing power, no more, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;less, then your scheme cannot work as you envision it, and it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;become a tool of repression for the powerful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once again, not really.  It doesn't take much computing power at all to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; browse an efficiently designed and frequently updated database.  Each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen would not have to bear the onerous burden of creating and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintaining their own database.  The database would be publicly maintained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (of course under the glare of a great deal of transparency).  When I wanted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the info, I'd just cruise on over to the database, log in and have a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around.  Not much different than what happens now when you go to google.com.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I would not have much advantage using a 1ghz Pentium III over somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using a 66mhz 486 in browsing such a database.
</EM><BR>
<P>You obviously do not comprehend the scope of the problem at hand. We are
<BR>
talking the ability to monitor and filter the input of MILLIONS of
<BR>
cameras, giving real=time output of deeds being done. The computer that
<BR>
can do that has not been built yet, and when it is YOU won't the first
<BR>
person to get one, it will be the government and the big corporations.
