<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;If producers give away excess capacity below cost, it lowers the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;margin on the grain that they do sell for a profit, sometimes forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;them out of the market.  The short-term effect may be beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;(recovering expenses), but the glut of too cheap grain creates a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;negative long-term effect on overall production because it decreases 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;effective market size from a producers standpoint.  If the world worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;your way, the producers would quickly sink into unprofitability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;would shut down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So its just like OPEC.  They are destroying produce to artificially 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inflate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the price.  Perhaps this indicates that there are too many grain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;producers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and that society (and the grain market) would be better off if some of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *did* shut down?  I realize that probably wouldn't go over too well for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those producers that had to do the shutting down.  But in general might 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not be better than the collosal waste that current practice creates?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The thing is, Zero, that in an economy the size of ours (which a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person cannot totally appreciate), a few million pounds of grain is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sort of waste you will get merely because the system that is already in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;place to discourage farmers from planting too much might be off on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;estimates by a fraction of a percent, or if the estimated rainfall is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off by a few percent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A good comparison is to compare the grain production of the US with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wood consumption of building a house. Most contractors and architects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will budget in at least 10-20% overage for wood that is waste cuttings:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its those ends of short wood that are useless, or wood that arrives with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;splits, knots, warps, theft, etc..  Using the current wastage of the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grain market, which deals with forces of nature that are far harder to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;estimate for and control than a supply of well cut wood, the contractors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would have to improve their efficiency by a factor of two to four to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as good and efficient with their wood.
</EM><BR>
<P>That seems to make sense.  As much as I *hate* waste, I cannot completely 
<BR>
eliminate it from my own life.  I don't suppose I can blame contractors or 
<BR>
farmers for having the same problem.  Do you know how much grain is dumped 
<BR>
on average per year?  And what percentage that is of total US production?
<BR>
