<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem with technological determinism is simply that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it is wrong - it is an oversimplified view of history,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ignoring the complex interplay between technology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society, economics, individuals, serependipity and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; influences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I'm looking at a specific event in history then I agree,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological determinism is overly simplistic.  But if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking at history itself then it makes (some) sense to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at technology as an independent force.  Anything on a lesser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scale is bounded by the limits of the technology at the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and can have very little overall effect.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, civilizations are bounded by the limits of technology, and I
<BR>
certainly think one can make a very strong case that the space of
<BR>
possible political systems at any time is technology dependent. No
<BR>
problem there.
<BR>
<P>But is technology (T) an independent factor, or linked with everything
<BR>
else (E)?  Is the equations T'(t)=f(T), E'(t)=g(T,E) or T'(t)=f(T,E),
<BR>
E'(t)=g(T,E)? I would definitely say the later. We have seen societies
<BR>
*not* develop their technology due to cultural constraints (like China
<BR>
after it closed up for a variety of complex causes) or due to natural
<BR>
resources (no wheels in mesoamerica due to the lack of useful beasts
<BR>
of burden), as well as a complex and fascinating interplay of factors
<BR>
making technological development flicker across the West throughout
<BR>
last millennium. It doesn't seem that unlikely that these factors,
<BR>
that affected a sizeable chunk of all available humans at the time,
<BR>
could under other circumstances have led to another technology
<BR>
development curve. Maybe we should really be thankful for the
<BR>
distribution of land masses enabling sufficient cultural and resource
<BR>
diversity to allow a globally exponential technological development
<BR>
over a long time. 
<BR>
<P>Maybe the time to start worrying is now, when we are racing towards a
<BR>
situation where cultural factors can influence technology globally...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Certainly there are feedback loops that drive certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technologies (think Moore's law and how much people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expecting it to be true) but technology is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; independent force from everything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps we can speed up or slow down progress (or even stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it).  How would we do this?  If by supression then we imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that technology is an independent force.
</EM><BR>
<P>Suppose everybody thinks that it is pointless to develop new
<BR>
computers. There might be some tinkerers doing it anyway, but there is
<BR>
no market demand so they will not be rewarded. After a while, when
<BR>
everybody is using the same old systems, even a radically better new
<BR>
system would have a hard time finding good applications because
<BR>
everybody is using the same old applications with no need to
<BR>
change. This cannot happen in our culture right now (can it? It just
<BR>
felt like someone named Bill stepped on my dewar) due to the overall
<BR>
feeling of change and progress - change breeds change - but that is
<BR>
really a fairly recent historical innovation. There have been
<BR>
societies with stagnant technology like I suggest above in the past.
<BR>
<P>Note that I'm not saying they are perfectly stable - they will
<BR>
probably change with time, and even stagnant societies can revive
<BR>
quite a bit. But it is not because technology wills it, it is because
<BR>
of an interplay of cultural factors (like changes in politics,
<BR>
religion, writing, new ideas or inefficiency), outside factors (trade,
<BR>
competition, changing neighbors) and hard to predict individual
<BR>
factors like lone geniuses, great accidents, nutty emperors or random
<BR>
chance.
<BR>
<P>Today what drives technology seems to be partially profit (financial
<BR>
or otherwise), partially the curiosity of the &quot;nerdocracy&quot; :-) There
<BR>
are many factors, different in different places and often competing
<BR>
directly with each other. This is actually for the best, because it
<BR>
makes it very hard for single factors to inhibit the development. A
<BR>
recession would mean a lot of energy would go into making things
<BR>
cheap, energy efficient or at least work for Mr Engineer and his
<BR>
neighbours, a local ban makes development move elsewhere, a shift in
<BR>
public opinion practically always produces an opposite undertow and so
<BR>
on.
