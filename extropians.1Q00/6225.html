<EM>&gt; &gt; Spike I'm also enjoying Brin's book.  But he seems to waffle over 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinks complete transparency is a good idea, which makes me think that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am a little bit too extremist in my own views.  Oh well, wasn't there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thread around here lately about value of extremists?  :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Exactly!  Anyone who has read my comments on openness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;infonudism over the past year knows Ive waffled more than Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Clinton regarding whether a transparent society is good or bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There will be winners and losers.  One big loser I can think of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is the local porno shop owner, just struggling to make a decent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;living like the rest of us, will lose the patronage of the local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ministerial trade, not to mention most of the deacons, choir, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thats just one example, but abuses are easy to imagine.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;earlier comments on the MikeTracker and the sphexcam are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;two others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Im with you, Zero, in that the tranparent society will probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make it much harder on would-be despots, but we could lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some freedoms to do ordinary legal naughtiness which we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might not want our spouses or coworkers to know about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It isnt as simple as admitting to everyone all our bad habits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brin is right to point out that the transparent society is a mixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blessing/curse.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  Although I'm convinced (so far) that the blessings would outweigh 
<BR>
the curses, I agree that there will be times when even *I* would curse the 
<BR>
confounded system.  But isn't that the case with any useful technology?  Who 
<BR>
doesn't love the freedom and autonomy of getting in your car and going where 
<BR>
you want?  At the same time who doesn't hate the noise and air polution they 
<BR>
cause?  As with anything else in life you have to take the good with the 
<BR>
bad.
