<EM>&gt; Subject: StockGeneration (was Re: [scam] $ pyramid scheme)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 13 months ago, when I heard of StockGeneration, I spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 4 hours analyzing the game and its rules. I came to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the conclusion that it was very well designed, could last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a long time, and could make me a lot of money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I put in $6,000. I've taken out over $90,000 in cash. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $664,000 left in my portfolio. I'm in a position to take out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about $20,000 per month.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Why????
<BR>
<P>What risk did you bear? You can't get 10%+ risk-free returns when there is
<BR>
trillions of dollars in US debt being publicly traded fo 5.7-6.73% returns.
<BR>
Economies don't work that way.
<BR>
<P>The game is nonsustainable. What if the US government sold another $400b in
<BR>
debt and put it into that game? What do you think would happen? You can bet
<BR>
that they wouldn't have $40b to pay the US government at the end of the
<BR>
first month.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;risk&quot; you are bearing in this game is credit risk, which is huge. And,
<BR>
in fact, you're not getting any premium for it.
<BR>
<P>You are very lucky to have made money on this. But tell me how this is
<BR>
different than a chain letter or the Albanian money pyramid scheme. Please.
<BR>
<P>I spend MANY hours a day doing finance-related things. And I'm telling you
<BR>
that the people who solicit participants in this game can expect to go to
<BR>
jail.
<BR>
<P>If I see another post on this subject telling anyone, anywhere, that this is
<BR>
a good idea then I'm going to report this to the appropriate authorities.
<BR>
<P>We have enough problems with moron penny stock games.
<BR>
