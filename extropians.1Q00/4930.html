<P>Ja, in fact I was once involved in a humanitarian effort to help a group
<BR>
of isolated people in Central America.  It was noted that the people
<BR>
looked beautiful and healthy, until it was realized that they were all
<BR>
young, the oldest was around 40.  Turns out the problem was what
<BR>
amounted to the digestive system wearing out, caused by tooth loss,
<BR>
caused by excessive wear, caused by the staple of their diet, which
<BR>
was tough indigenous grain, which was being ground in hollowed
<BR>
stones called metates.  As a grinding agent, the women would add
<BR>
a bit of sand to the grain, which would in fact make the grinding
<BR>
job easier, however, the slightly gritty bread that was made therefrom
<BR>
still contained some of the quartz dust, which would erode the enamel,
<BR>
eventually causing the loss of the tooth and subsequent increase in
<BR>
the effort needed by the digestive system to process the course meal.
<BR>
<P>So we supplied them with three things: a grinding wheel, a reverse
<BR>
osmosis water filter (which eliminated amoebiasis) and a supply of
<BR>
kaopectate, which prevented many infant deaths.  In the long run
<BR>
the effect was to cause the population to increase beyond what
<BR>
that high desert location could support, and the young people
<BR>
began to drift off to Mexico City to lives of who knows what,
<BR>
but with their limited education of things modern (none), and
<BR>
lack of language skills they probably ended up as prostitutes
<BR>
or worse.  We were debating discontinuing the effort when the
<BR>
only practical way into their mesa, an airplane, was stolen... spike
