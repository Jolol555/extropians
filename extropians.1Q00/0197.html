<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
This is the most important posting I have ever made here.  Let me introduce 
<BR>
you to a gentleman by the name of James Swayze who is a keen mind trapped in 
<BR>
a quadriplegic body that is wracked by pain.  I have been in private 
<BR>
correspondance with him and he is one of the finest people I have yet met on 
<BR>
the net.
<BR>
<P>He wishes to have a cryonics policy but would prefer paying his own way with 
<BR>
some help rather then simply take charity.  In trying to deal with his 
<BR>
situation he has conceived of various devices that would greatly help people 
<BR>
in his situation.  In partnership with one of you here he could perhaps 
<BR>
bring these to market and raise funds for himself.  But if all else fails he 
<BR>
would be willing to accept donations to a cryonics organization so he could 
<BR>
be eventually suspended.
<BR>
<P>In his words you will discover an individual who is very articulate and 
<BR>
thoughtful who has suffered in ways that would inspire dread in all of us.  
<BR>
He sees cryonics as a possible route to a healthy body and absolutely 
<BR>
deserves his chance I believe.
<BR>
<P>Among extropian digest members there are so many capable people.  I would 
<BR>
ask that those of you who feel you could help (and be helped) by James 
<BR>
Swayze to contact him.
<BR>
<P>I realize some of you do subscribe to Cryonet but many others do not and so 
<BR>
I have reproduced his two posts here to share with you all the thoughts of 
<BR>
this man.  I could have recommended going to the archive but then many might 
<BR>
not get around to read his words.
<BR>
<P>He starts out in the first post sounding somewhat angry and bitter but this 
<BR>
is in response to a Cryonet topic of why some people choose death over 
<BR>
enduring pain.  But later in the next post he shares how his heart had been 
<BR>
touched by the outpouring of support he had gotten from the list members.  
<BR>
James goes on to discuss how government barely gives him enough support and 
<BR>
yet prevents him from trying to better himself!  It would be a terrible 
<BR>
dilemma to be in.
<BR>
<P>While the Cryonet list members are considering various ways of helping him I 
<BR>
am sure the extropians need to be made aware of him also.  When you read his 
<BR>
posts you will know that he is one of you.  And if any group of people have 
<BR>
the skills to help him it is right here.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg

<P>RE: DAF discussions
<BR>
<P>I've only read a few of the arguments here about DAF. From what I have read 
<BR>
I
<BR>
find it difficult to &quot;extrapolate&quot; much more than a bunch of wordy 
<BR>
individuals
<BR>
that delight in sounding intelligent through the use of 10 dollar words and
<BR>
circular logic. I can further tell that none of you has ever really 
<BR>
suffered. I
<BR>
have and still do. I have been a quadriplegic for 20 years. Contrary to 
<BR>
common
<BR>
conception I DO have pain, very much of it in fact. I along with the 
<BR>
paralysis
<BR>
happen to suffer a bone disease and the dubious distinction of being the 
<BR>
worst
<BR>
case of that disease. I am also diabetic. I am alone and impoverished and 
<BR>
have
<BR>
little practical prospects for alleviating my loneliness.
<BR>
<P>So, I suffer 3 kinds of pain. The first is familiar to all, your basic pain 
<BR>
felt
<BR>
where my nerves still transmit. The second is terribly insidious and is 
<BR>
called
<BR>
&quot;Autonomic Hypereflexic Dysreflexia&quot;. This causes my blood pressure to rise
<BR>
rapidly and dangerously in response to pain stimulus located in areas where 
<BR>
my
<BR>
nerves no longer transmit. There is much anguish to go along with this kind 
<BR>
of
<BR>
pain as I am in danger each and every day of suffering a stroke from the
<BR>
heightened blood pressure which for some odd reason targets especially the 
<BR>
brain
<BR>
causing unbelievable headaches. These headaches increase in magnitude with 
<BR>
each
<BR>
and every heart beat pushing me closer and closer with each pulse to 
<BR>
possible
<BR>
stroke,
<BR>
loss of control or plain oblivion.
<BR>
<P>The third type of pain is mental. I mentioned the loneliness. Imagine if you
<BR>
will that every time you see an attractive woman you must swallow your pride 
<BR>
and
<BR>
forget any aspirations because you, to her, are invisible. Imagine not 
<BR>
having an
<BR>
orgasm whether self induced or with the congress of said attractive woman 
<BR>
for
<BR>
more than 20 years and having no hope of ever having one again in ones 
<BR>
lifetime.
<BR>
Imagine being inventive and intelligent but lacking the use of ones hands to
<BR>
bring any brilliant ideas to fruition. I could go on and on but I think I 
<BR>
have
<BR>
made my point. I doubt any of you really knows suffering as I know 
<BR>
suffering,
<BR>
pain as I know pain. Such suffering and pain that could cause one to seek 
<BR>
relief
<BR>
from oblivion.
<BR>
<P>I consider it every day. So far I have chosen to endure. However, that could
<BR>
change. I would rather be transported and have at least a small chance of
<BR>
realizing the life I lost. For I am not living now I am only existing. I 
<BR>
have
<BR>
for brief periods experienced nonexistence. I was coded when my heart 
<BR>
stopped
<BR>
once. It was total unconsciousness. I know this because I have no memory of 
<BR>
how
<BR>
it felt, only the loss of time. I know this is how death would be. No
<BR>
consciousness....no pain! It's quite simple really and no need for circular
<BR>
syllogistic acrobatics.
<BR>
<P>Like I said I would rather be transported, perhaps even downloaded--provided 
<BR>
it
<BR>
meant some hope of feeling something again. However, I must face reality. I
<BR>
haven't the funds to pay for cryonics. I will keep trying as long as I can 
<BR>
to
<BR>
produce them but there may come a day when I must decide an awful choice. I 
<BR>
must
<BR>
make my choice while I still have the capacity to do so. I am 41 years old 
<BR>
and
<BR>
the quadriplegia, the bone disease and the diabetes are eating away at me. 
<BR>
One
<BR>
day I may not be able to, for myself, end my pain in the face of the reality 
<BR>
of
<BR>
no chance for transportation. Shouldn't I deserve if not in life at least in
<BR>
death, some small bit of dignity? What would you do?
<BR>
<P>James Swayze

<P>RE: Gracious response I have received
<BR>
<P>First let me say sorry for being silent so long. The New Year and fatigue 
<BR>
and a
<BR>
computer mishap
<BR>
(locked up and wiped an entire letter I was working on to post) got in the 
<BR>
way.
<BR>
I am humbled and awed by the caring response I have received from you all to 
<BR>
my
<BR>
post. I Have written some of you individually so forgive me if I repeat 
<BR>
myself
<BR>
here. I am feeling a bit silly for the antagonistic tone of my post. Not one 
<BR>
of
<BR>
you has criticized me for that. I have great hope for humanity and faith in
<BR>
humanism and you all reinforce that for me so incredibly much. I also want 
<BR>
to
<BR>
apologize for mistakenly giving the impression that I may be actively 
<BR>
suicidal
<BR>
presently. In my effort to make my point I chose the wrong words. I should 
<BR>
have
<BR>
said that it is something that given no better alternative is everyday in 
<BR>
the
<BR>
back of my mind. However, I don't brood over it constantly and I would not
<BR>
describe myself as clinically depressed. I like to consider that my 
<BR>
depression
<BR>
could easily be cured with a job and a girlfriend, in other words a real 
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P>I must also say when I wrote my first post I had no intention to solicit 
<BR>
help
<BR>
from you all toward the
<BR>
goal of cryonic suspension. I was surprised and frankly flabbergasted from 
<BR>
this
<BR>
result. That being
<BR>
said I want you all to know I definitely would accept any help I could get. 
<BR>
Only
<BR>
a fool would refuse
<BR>
if under my circumstances. After all, in my belief, it would be the saving 
<BR>
of my
<BR>
life and hopefully
<BR>
so much more. Not three weeks ago I contacted one of the contacts for 
<BR>
acquiring
<BR>
insurance policies to cover suspension contracts that was listed on Alcor's
<BR>
site. They were compassionate towards me but did not know of any company 
<BR>
willing
<BR>
to take the risk with all of my ailments. I admit I did feel some despair 
<BR>
from
<BR>
that and perhaps it came out in my post here that day.
<BR>
<P>I have been in touch with some of you individually where I proposed my wish 
<BR>
to
<BR>
do what I can to do my part. As I mentioned in my post I am inventive. I 
<BR>
have
<BR>
been seeking for some time any who could, for a full partnership, help me in
<BR>
obtaining patents and such as needed to bring my ideas to fruition. In this 
<BR>
way
<BR>
the help will be in helping me help myself. I am not in any way refusing the
<BR>
pledges I just want to be a part and do what I can. I and those of you I am 
<BR>
in
<BR>
contact with are discussing several ideas even a book about my life, which 
<BR>
is
<BR>
actually considered quite a story. Further I am an artist and can paint 
<BR>
(when
<BR>
the muse is kind to me) and wish to try sculpture for which I have several 
<BR>
ideas
<BR>
floating around for quite some time. One of my biggest problems is too many
<BR>
ideas for time and ability to accomplish. I have also been known to build 
<BR>
model
<BR>
airplanes using special rubber band and paper clip clamps I designed which I 
<BR>
can
<BR>
grab with my teeth and a thumb and clasp around a part to hold while gluing.
<BR>
Perhaps I could do art or crafts (I build clocks out of old pc hard drives 
<BR>
and
<BR>
motherboards) for commissions.
<BR>
<P>Some may be wondering how a quad can do all I have mentioned. Though I am a
<BR>
quad, meaning four extremities paralyzed, I am not as impaired as Chris 
<BR>
Reeves
<BR>
when it comes to the use of my hands and arms and breathing. My level of 
<BR>
injury
<BR>
is C5/C6, where C means cervical. Chris's injury is higher than that and 
<BR>
thus he
<BR>
has more impairment. My triceps muscles and many others in my arms do not 
<BR>
work
<BR>
but my biceps and shoulder muscles do. My hands are clinched into a semi 
<BR>
rigid
<BR>
fist. I type by stuffing two sticks with rubber tips between my fingers and 
<BR>
can
<BR>
manage maybe 30 words per minute for a short stint as I get fatigued 
<BR>
quickly.
<BR>
<P>Since I am able to do the things I mentioned and more that I haven't one may
<BR>
fairly ask why can't he work a job? Some may already know the answer to
<BR>
this--disincentives. Now I have heard a rumor that legislation was signed by
<BR>
Clinton that would change some rules that make it impossible for a lot of
<BR>
disabled people to work but I have not seen any news reports of it. I 
<BR>
already
<BR>
planned on looking further into it though. However, this may only be federal 
<BR>
and
<BR>
not affect the local level much. So far for all of my life as a disabled 
<BR>
person
<BR>
the rules have been prohibitive.
<BR>
<P>For instance I am not allowed to own anything over $500 in value so, 
<BR>
technically
<BR>
I can't own my pc or my TV or my stereo, etc., etc.  I am not allowed to 
<BR>
have
<BR>
more than $1500 in liquidible assets or savings. I cannot own a home in 
<BR>
which I
<BR>
do not also live in. I cannot own stocks or bonds. I may
<BR>
only own one vehicle. I must report any income over $25 and that which I 
<BR>
report
<BR>
gets taken away from what I receive so the net gain is zero. These rules 
<BR>
were
<BR>
devised to stop welfare fraud and when applied to the able bodied are 
<BR>
justified.
<BR>
Now there is some allowed extra income for Social Security Disability 
<BR>
pensioners
<BR>
to earn up to a certain amount but it is totally unrealistic in the real 
<BR>
world.
<BR>
This also doesn't take into account the way it meshes with the state portion 
<BR>
of
<BR>
the equation.
<BR>
<P>The biggest disincentive is losing medical coverage. I get $516.55 per month
<BR>
social security disability (SDI) and supplemental security income (SSI)
<BR>
combined. Of that the supplemental security income is $36.55. That is my 
<BR>
entire
<BR>
income unless you include free rent in my folks' home. If I got more from 
<BR>
SDI I
<BR>
would get less SSI. SSI pays my Medicare premium and qualifies me for state 
<BR>
paid
<BR>
Chore Service or my care attendant, which by the way has been my step 
<BR>
brother
<BR>
mostly for these twenty years. If I earned more I would lose SSI and thus 
<BR>
lose
<BR>
the chore service and have to pay for that myself which I could begin to do.
<BR>
<P>My medical costs for supplies, drugs, nursing service fees and wheelchair
<BR>
service was $41,000 last year. This did not take into account doctors fees, 
<BR>
the
<BR>
chore service of $1229 per month and
<BR>
hospital costs. My wheelchair cost $25,000 and is 8 years old. I haven't 
<BR>
been as
<BR>
active as I could
<BR>
be or would have to be if employed but when I was I wore out wheelchairs at 
<BR>
a
<BR>
rate of one every
<BR>
three years. A vehicle for me to drive would be in the neighborhood of 
<BR>
$50,000.
<BR>
<P>If I were employed, away from home, I would need more than one chore person 
<BR>
to
<BR>
manage me and my household chores. Right now the state has me at the highest
<BR>
rate of pay for my step brother and for this he is supposed to cover my 
<BR>
needs 24
<BR>
hours a day 7 days a week. It's ludicrous and would be illegal for minimum 
<BR>
wage
<BR>
alone if they didn't get around it by making him an independent contractor.
<BR>
Something can happen that requires assistance at any time of the day or 
<BR>
night
<BR>
and there is no planning it. Often it is the type of thing that if not dealt
<BR>
with right away can cause injury or even death. The two most dangerous and
<BR>
common are bowel and urinary difficulties. I already described what can 
<BR>
happen
<BR>
if either cannot be emptied. In the case of an accident the skin is 
<BR>
immediately
<BR>
in danger of break down which if occurs takes months to heal and can lead to
<BR>
costly surgeries with skin grafts. The only way we manage is that I am 
<BR>
fortunate
<BR>
enough to have a loving family that pitches in when my step brother is away 
<BR>
at
<BR>
his other job or living his own life.
<BR>
<P>This is all probably more than you all wanted to know. I apologize for 
<BR>
rambling
<BR>
on. I do not mind
<BR>
telling what life this way is like. If more people knew perhaps the 
<BR>
government
<BR>
would be compelled to better remove the barriers and let us do something to
<BR>
contribute. Even if we couldn't reach break even point I think the overall 
<BR>
cost
<BR>
for the country would be less. Once about ten years ago I calculated what I
<BR>
would need as starting out pay to sever the umbilical chord attached to 
<BR>
Uncle
<BR>
Sam. To provide enough to pay for the medical and the care and the equipment 
<BR>
and
<BR>
the trappings that one needs to stay within the social level of ones peers 
<BR>
would
<BR>
take at least $125,000 per year and that's conservative and half of it is 
<BR>
chore
<BR>
and household care. Why the social level part? Does anyone trust a salesman 
<BR>
that
<BR>
drives a junker? How many successful executives compete very well in the 
<BR>
ladder
<BR>
climb wearing cheap clothes living in run down quarters or otherwise not 
<BR>
showing
<BR>
the signs of success? Are there a lot of $125,000 a year jobs out there? Not
<BR>
many I assume. Should the figure be adjusted upwards for 10 years inflation? 
<BR>
I
<BR>
would be glad to work if it comes about either through realistic removal of
<BR>
disincentives or some end around that would allow me to work without losing 
<BR>
my
<BR>
medical coverage and pay for a care attendant. I would of course be very 
<BR>
happy
<BR>
and would really love working as a volunteer for any of the Cryonics groups
<BR>
<P>These disincentives are why I have for many years pinned my hopes on one of 
<BR>
my
<BR>
inventions one day paying off. If I were able somehow to provide for myself 
<BR>
with
<BR>
the aid of some opened doors the pledges made on my behalf could be 
<BR>
nullified or
<BR>
provided for someone else. That of course is not up to me. However, I want 
<BR>
to
<BR>
pledge that should the fruit of my newly shot in the arm endeavors end up 
<BR>
being
<BR>
beyond expectation, in other words should we make a pile from one of my
<BR>
inventions or a book or what ever, I will sponsor someone of need as well
<BR>
myself.
<BR>
<P>In closing I wish to say I would eagerly welcome and invite anyone to 
<BR>
contact me
<BR>
in any manner. If anyone is near my area or passing through please do stop 
<BR>
in. I
<BR>
crave intellectual conversation and the company of like minded thinkers. My
<BR>
family though I love them dearly do not all share my beliefs. Fortunately my
<BR>
best friend and step brother does. Here is my contact information.
