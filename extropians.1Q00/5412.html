<EM>&gt;  &gt; I can back this up.  I have several friends who haven't paid income tax in

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you be a little more specific about the right paperwork and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right hoops? Not that I contemplate anything drastic, but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly interested on IRS' reasoning behind granting this.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>First off, I do pay my taxes and have a generally non-adversarial
<BR>
relationship with the IRS (other than the implicit ones), so I don't have
<BR>
the depth of knowledge of someone who has actually gone through the
<BR>
hassle.
<BR>
<P>One thing to note is that the government will deny you certain privileges
<BR>
normally granted to all citizens if you intentionally do not pay your
<BR>
taxes.  For example, if you as a U.S. citizen marry someone who is not,
<BR>
applications for permanent residency and citizenship for your spouse will
<BR>
be denied.  However, the government can be bribed in this case: you have to
<BR>
pay them three years worth of (back) taxes and they will grant your spouse
<BR>
residency/citizenship.
<BR>
<P>The IRS appears to distinguish between to different types of people who
<BR>
don't pay taxes: passive resisters (people who simply fail to pay taxes)
<BR>
and active resisters (people who actively file legal paperwork with the
<BR>
government).  The so-called passive tax resisters are the ones the IRS
<BR>
usually goes after.
<BR>
<P>Apparently there are several lengthy legal and administrative procedures
<BR>
that will allow one to effectively opt out if you are willing to give up
<BR>
some government granted privileges.  I would speculate there are a couple
<BR>
reasons this might be allowed to happen:
<BR>
<P>1)  There is no legal basis for opting out, but the IRS would rather not
<BR>
waste resources fighting legal battles with those who have demonstrated
<BR>
the willingess and tenacity to do so.
<BR>
<P>2)  There is a marginal legal basis for opting out, but it is possible to
<BR>
file blocking actions that make it very difficult for the IRS to pursue
<BR>
you, so they go after easier targets.
<BR>
<P>3)  There is a legal basis for opting out, but not one they want to
<BR>
advertise or make widely available.
