<P>The plan was to consider totally self-contained reactions at first. One reason

is that I'm not going to assume that every life form has an O2 atmosphere. I

don't want someone to not mention a nifty compound that needs to burn in

flourine, on the assumption that it can't compete with a chemical that combines

in free-oxygen. To a flourine breather, its the O2 reactions that are going to

be nasty things...
