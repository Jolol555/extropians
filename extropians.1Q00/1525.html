<EM>&gt;&gt; but I simply cannot tolerate the sheer loutishness

<EM>&gt;&gt; and incivility exhibited here by this supercilious

<P><EM>&gt; Robert, I suggest you relax and give Shaun a

<BR>
<P><P>Max,
<BR>
<P>Please don't construe the following as in any way a criticism of your having
<BR>
said positive things about Shaun, a lad whose need of a good word in his favor
<BR>
-- particularly by you or someone officially in a leadership role at ExI -- was
<BR>
clearly felt by many.
<BR>
<P>I simply think Robert deserves a good word as well.
<BR>
<P>Robert is one of the smartest, most intellectually engaged people I've ever
<BR>
encountered on any email list -- perhaps THE most intellectually (and
<BR>
productively) engaged. Particularly striking is the volume of extraordinarily
<BR>
thoughtful, expositionally lucid, coherent articles he posts. On another list, I
<BR>
recently called him Robert &quot;Jupiter Brain&quot; Owen to highlight one of the
<BR>
hypotheses I have to explain the super-human cognition that seems to be required
<BR>
for his output. (The other: that there are several people who agreed to work
<BR>
together under one name, to create the impression of a person of super-human
<BR>
capacity.)
<BR>
<P>The post which set Robert off was one which clearly evinced a failure to have
<BR>
understood Robert's previous reasoning. There were other things that were
<BR>
annoying about Shaun's post, like the insulting tone -- perhaps these were the
<BR>
most salient for Robert. But the failure to see the meaning of Robert's
<BR>
carefully thought-through posts alone would have been quite frustrating,
<BR>
especially if one assumes that the failure resulted from laziness, as opposed to
<BR>
stupidity.
<BR>
<P>I make no claims about the source of Shaun's failure to understand (I don't know
<BR>
him). I merely mean to highlight that Robert's experience might be more
<BR>
frustrating than you (or others) realize. Imagine you've just given a delicately
<BR>
constructed argument in a conference talk, and you suddenly discover that the
<BR>
audience isn't listening very closely, is drunk, yet nevertheless feels it
<BR>
possesses the right to respond. Whatever Shaun's actual state of mind, the
<BR>
example probably captures Robert's experience. For me, such an experience would
<BR>
be frustrating enough to warrant a response like Robert's, perhaps even a
<BR>
stronger one. (I might also just join the drunkenness -- indeed, this might even
<BR>
be another way of understanding Robert's response, his favored drink being
<BR>
perhaps different from those of most.)
<BR>
<P>If Extropians lost Robert, the overall caliber of the list would suffer
<BR>
immensely.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.

My email was (mostly) down from ~1999.12.26 through
2000.01.02, and has been sporadic since then.
Things believed to have been sent to, or from me might
not have been. Sorry.
