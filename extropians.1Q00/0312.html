<P>
Sorry to keep banging on about this, but I'm deep into revisions, updates
<BR>
and expansions of my book THE SPIKE, for publication in the USA later this
<BR>
year. I'm try to address some of the critical objections to v. 1.0,
<BR>
especially certain complaints that the economics (implicit and explicit)
<BR>
were handwaving and/or naive. I'm happy to stick by some of what I wrote
<BR>
(eg, that we might end up with a gift economy if assemblers prove cheap and
<BR>
tractable), but the vexing issue is the realistic pathway there.
<BR>
<P>Brutally: who pays, and why?
<BR>
<P>Here's what I've sketched in draft. It's thin as it stands. I'd welcome any
<BR>
exact analytical commentary, either on or off list. If my terminology is
<BR>
wrong, tell me. Urls to papers that have addressed these issues would be
<BR>
especially welcome. If anyone knows Dr Drexler or his associates and wishes
<BR>
to pass this along for their commentary, feel free to do so.
<BR>
<P>(I know this thread will immediately turn into a blistering debate on the
<BR>
nature of the Buddha's views of spacetime, or the sociobiology of sport,
<BR>
but I really would welcome some focussed reaction. We've got to get these
<BR>
ideas out there, people, and I have a nice window right now. I would like
<BR>
to make sure that what I'm saying is as informed and accurate as possible.
<BR>
And as Prof Robin will tell you, I'm no economist.)
<BR>
<P>==================
<BR>
<P>In what follows, `minting' is a user-friendly synonym for MNT, molecular
<BR>
nanotechnology.
<BR>
<P>==================
<BR>
<P>Once you have a working matter compiler, you can share out the job of
<BR>
writing the programs to a hundred million nano hackers on the Internet.
<BR>
Today, computer enthusiasts write reams of code and post it for free, or as
<BR>
shareware--just for the pleasure of it, for the art, to show how good they
<BR>
are, to earn the esteem of their peers. Increasingly, vast code structures
<BR>
like the operating system Linux are `open source', freely available for
<BR>
elaboration by a host of enthusiasts who participate in their development
<BR>
and evolution. MP3 digital music is increasingly available on the Web, and
<BR>
while the record companies were nervous at first, they are adapting,
<BR>
learning to make money even when music of every kind is running free. In
<BR>
the future enthusiasts will be up all night coding ever more subtle and
<BR>
cunning Killer Apps for the mint, selling them from garage start-ups (until
<BR>
the code pirates sell the CD-Roms at a 99 percent discount, or generously
<BR>
steal and re-post your code on the net), or, like the graffiti tagger kids
<BR>
did back in the 20th century, finding street glory by sending their own
<BR>
applications out instantly onto the net as shareware and freeware. 
<BR>
<P>Reality check--hard economics
<BR>
<P>We need to pause here and take a breath. Who is supposed to be funding this
<BR>
leap into future technology, especially when its end result is a new kind
<BR>
of productivity that bites the hand that feeds it? Grant for the sake of
<BR>
argument that Drexler's trajectory of development is not impossible, even
<BR>
that it makes quite a lot of sense. Somebody starts with first-stage
<BR>
molecular nano-technology in the lab, and step by step a new industry
<BR>
emerges, culminating in fourth-stage or mature minting. Each of those steps
<BR>
needs to have its independent economic rationale. Corporations and private
<BR>
investors must be convinced that their money will earn a good return--a
<BR>
better return than if it were put into hamburger franchises or real estate.
<BR>
Yet how can they sensibly arrive at that conclusion if the extravagant,
<BR>
utopian dreams of nano's more vocal enthusiasts have any validity? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the matter crudely: putting your nest egg into nanotechnology, it
<BR>
might be said, would be like investing in a machine that could counterfeit
<BR>
money, or turn lead into gold. Even if counterfeiting where not a crime,
<BR>
imagine the inflationary consequences. Well, of course, in a way the
<BR>
post-World War Two western economies and their banking systems have been
<BR>
exactly such machines, pumping out paper money that is issued as a promise
<BR>
against endless future growth. So far, with a hiccup or two, the global
<BR>
economy has done quite well under this shaky fiction or non-stop juggling
<BR>
act. That's because technology really has managed to produce more and more
<BR>
for the same amount of effort.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry Jones saw how things were going in the micro-electronics end of the
<BR>
economy, and in Sleepers, Wake! put his finger on what will also drive the
<BR>
development of minting. Miniaturisation, he notes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permits an exponential rise in output together with an exponential fall in
<BR>
total inputs--energy, labor, capital, space and time. In economic history
<BR>
there is no remote equivalent to this... This overturns the folk-wisdom
<BR>
that for every advantage there is a corresponding disadvantage or price to
<BR>
be paid (`You can't have your cake and eat it too'). 
<BR>
<P><P>Cybernetics theorist of the 1950s, Norbert Wiener, foresaw
<BR>
computer-controlled automation as a kind of equivalent to slave labor, and
<BR>
hence supposed that human workers in competition with these machines would
<BR>
be driven into ruinous slave-wages themselves. That hasn't happened, by and
<BR>
large, although there is an increasingly large number of people either
<BR>
without work or sequestered in part-time work for McDonald's or the local
<BR>
hypermart. Still, as Jones points out, Wiener's fears were misplaced
<BR>
because he `failed to read economic history... Slaves don't provide markets
<BR>
for sophisticated, diverse, personalised production. Computers break down
<BR>
hierarchical work structures, providing the challenge/opportunity of
<BR>
individual creativity.'  Even so, he acknowledges, there are victims: those
<BR>
lacking literacy and numeracy, people simply not able to join the
<BR>
`information rich'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all this is so only because investors can make money from
<BR>
information technology and the hardware that supports it. The technical
<BR>
dynamic that results in the frequent doublings recorded by Moore's law
<BR>
might falter if consumers suspect (as many do now) that they are paying for
<BR>
`bloatware', sloppy or massively redundant code requiring colossal extra
<BR>
amounts of computing grunt to do pretty much the same jobs about as well.
<BR>
If that happens, the national and international markets for an ever-growing
<BR>
number of small computers and their software will become exhausted.
<BR>
Meanwhile, the cost of refitting fabrication plants to create chips at
<BR>
smaller and denser scales balloons. Why should canny investors choose to
<BR>
move their money into the nano field if they can see, at the end of the
<BR>
development tunnel, an even more frightening prospect: assembler machines
<BR>
that literally compile material objects, including more of themselves?
<BR>
Where's the profit in that?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer, as usual, is that the market funds investments evaluated by a
<BR>
variety of horizons. IBM has been profligate in funding pure research, and
<BR>
has reaped rich rewards. Government-funded as well as privately-endowed
<BR>
university researchers continue to pump out endless astonishing discoveries
<BR>
and applications. Corporations such as Geron (in cancer, stem cell and
<BR>
telomere research) and Zyvex and Ntech (in micro- and nanotech realms) work
<BR>
on both immediate and long-term studies into topics that might yield truly
<BR>
flabbergasting outcomes eventually and in the meantime could bring more
<BR>
limited products to market. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall the development curve of today's almost ubiquitous personal
<BR>
computers, which started half a century ago as immense clunky behemoths,
<BR>
passed through phases or epochs where prices dropped by consecutive orders
<BR>
of magnitude so that first governments and their militaries could own
<BR>
computers, then huge businesses, then smaller businesses with the arrival
<BR>
of spreadsheets, then secretaries and students as word-processors became
<BR>
common, and now the gadgets are getting as routine as personal phones (an
<BR>
even more explosive marketing phenomenon), with specialised variants
<BR>
lurking under the hood of your car or running your microwave cooker. It
<BR>
will be the same with nanotechnology. Nobody expects K-Mart assemblers to
<BR>
arrive overnight. By the time they do, a lot of money will have been spent,
<BR>
a lot more recouped, and the economics of the world will have transitioned,
<BR>
by small and large jolts, into a new equilibrium (if we are lucky) as odd
<BR>
to our eyes today as the world of the Keynesian welfare state would have
<BR>
been to an 18th century merchant.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even experts who differ with Drexler over the wilder outcomes of the new
<BR>
miniaturisation technology agree that nano spells immense change in the
<BR>
economy. Professor George M. Whitesides, Mallinckrodt Professor of
<BR>
Chemistry at Harvard, sees nano as an extension of microelectromechanical
<BR>
machinery (MEMs). He notes, as we saw above, that shrinking the scale of
<BR>
superconductors, say, pushes up the costs of fabrication plants. `If you
<BR>
want 20 percent return on investment, and you put in $10 billion, how many
<BR>
microwidgets do you have to sell every year for the few years that that fab
<BR>
is the state of the art? The answer is, a lot. And people who have to put
<BR>
up the money don't like that.'  In the immediate future, Whitesides expects
<BR>
impacts from inexpensive microtechnology rather than nano. For example, he
<BR>
predicts that instead of a newspaper `you might buy a sheet of paper; the
<BR>
back side of it would be a battery, the front side of it would be a
<BR>
display. You read it, scroll to find reference works on it, see animated
<BR>
illustrations, and when you're done, you throw it away.' But making common
<BR>
consumables like reusable and downloadable paper with embedded
<BR>
microelectronics will provide some of the industrial base for more
<BR>
adventurous miniaturisations. Whitesides warns that you can't just shrink a
<BR>
machine and expect it to work. Those planning the creation of mints via a
<BR>
developmental trajectory like Drexler's four stages will take that for
<BR>
granted. It will be necessary to fund each step of the molecular nano
<BR>
revolution by careful, incremental advances that are each profitable but
<BR>
allow the shift to the next stage as it emerges from the lab.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that occurs, though, we really should expect to see some
<BR>
extraordinary leaps. Some of the limits common to today's economics of
<BR>
production and distribution will blow away. There is good news and bad in
<BR>
this prognosis.
