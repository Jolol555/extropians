<P>I read how in the U.S. Marine Corps the drill instructors call the very 
<BR>
obese recruits 'baby whales' and at the end of the 13 weeks these trainees 
<BR>
have lost weight and toned up quite alot due to the loving attention of 
<BR>
their instructors in making sure they get enough exercise and don't overeat. 
<BR>
;)  Now, we have overweight yuppies paying former drill instructors good 
<BR>
money to give them the sort of ferociously loving attention most nineteen 
<BR>
year-olds dread.  But of course it is not really the same thing.
<BR>
<P>I think a major reason in men and especially women for obesity is that they 
<BR>
see in the popular media all the 'beautiful people' who are models and so in 
<BR>
a state of frustration and despair they simply give up on exercising and 
<BR>
eating right since they feel they can never measure up to the cultural 
<BR>
ideals.  And then they see those around them who are 'blessed' and sometimes 
<BR>
lord it over them, which only increases the downward spiral.
<BR>
<P>Often painful experiences in childhood and the teen years due to cruel peers 
<BR>
are pivotal in creating this negative body-image and resulting 
<BR>
self-destructive behavior pattern.  I have seen this in many people I have 
<BR>
known in my own life.  If only we could all learn to be content in simply 
<BR>
being the best we can be with what nature gave us, combined with proper 
<BR>
exercise and diet.  The proper mental state is so key when it comes to 
<BR>
weight control.
<BR>
