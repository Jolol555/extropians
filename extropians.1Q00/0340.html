<P>I will note that Brian's replies on this subject clearly indicate
<BR>
that he is an &quot;informed&quot; consumer with regard to GM-foods.  That
<BR>
being said, I'll address a few points.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert is correct, Roundup is an herbicide, a very effective one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It kill virtually all weeds, and all grasses as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My concern is about runoff, especially with the increased use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Roundup such crops allow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This kind of agriculture is nonsustainable in the long run.
</EM><BR>
<P>We would have to go into a long discussion regarding ultimate
<BR>
breakdown products, downstream concentrations, etc. to come to
<BR>
some &quot;concrete&quot; conclusion regarding &quot;nonsutainable&quot;.  I will
<BR>
simply grant that it is &quot;undesirable&quot;.  Since I can see a relatively
<BR>
clear path to engineering food proteo-carbo-lipo-mass production
<BR>
facilities that would entirely eliminate both current agricultural
<BR>
production methods and &quot;weeds&quot;, I don't think extended discussion
<BR>
is worth the time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I shop organic all the time, yes it is more expensive, and you may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to change your lifestyle to afford the best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>My only point that as extropians, we should not throw out the baby
<BR>
with the bathwater.  You Brian, should be free to puruse an informed
<BR>
shopping agenda.  At the same time, that pursuit should not &quot;in effect&quot;
<BR>
deny the poorest segment of the population the access to most affordable
<BR>
nutritious foods that might be made available.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Crossbreeding involves co-evolution in an ecosystem, which adds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considerable checks and balance to the new forms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a point worthy of consideration (and one I've been thinking
<BR>
about).  Ultimately in GM crops, we would want to engineer in suicide
<BR>
genes in relative proximity to any &quot;enhancement&quot; genes.  That way if
<BR>
for any reason these genes get loose in the environment and are determined
<BR>
to have negative consequences we would potentially have a means for easily
<BR>
eliminating them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually that's only one trend, the agribusiness trend. There is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole foods other trend, including heirloom gardening, urban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gardening, market gardening, etc. New seed companies like &quot;Seeds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Change&quot; are not only saving lost varieties but producing new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; varieties that open pollinate. The goal is more nutrition per acre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than simply more crop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You will never get an argument from me on efforts to increase and
<BR>
preserve diversity.  I view all agro-variety as a unique collection
<BR>
of nanomachines that may have potential use.  I also would concur
<BR>
that the scientific evidence to date argues that &quot;agricultural&quot;
<BR>
variety increases areal productivity.  The problem that we face
<BR>
(from a resource standpoint) is making this productivity useful
<BR>
to us as humans.  (It might be useful to cows, but cows are ~10%
<BR>
as efficient as other plants in converting sunlight into useful
<BR>
food sources.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your agribusiness companies have made it a crime for farmers to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and save seed.....
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that was discussed for a while and Monsanto finally saw
<BR>
the light.  I ultimately think that the rate of innovation will
<BR>
get so fast that &quot;saving seed&quot; will become a relatively irrelevant
<BR>
argument.  [Economically it comes down to whether or not the
<BR>
added market value for the GM crops exceeds the seed cost
<BR>
relative to the value of older crops (GM or natural) derived
<BR>
from &quot;saved&quot; seeds.]  Provided the agri-business companies are
<BR>
innovating fast enough (driving up the value of the crops), the
<BR>
seed-saving mentality should become relatively unimportant.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I've already said, the paternalistic attitude of &quot;they aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smart enough to understand&quot; is unextropian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't mean to imply they aren't &quot;smart enough&quot;, I do mean to imply
<BR>
that we all draw conclusions with limited information.  Most individuals
<BR>
don't understand molecular biology or the human immune system.  That
<BR>
doesn't mean they &quot;can't&quot; it just means they don't currently possess
<BR>
the knowledge required for that understanding.  If they don't have
<BR>
that knowledge, then they are *not* qualified to make an informed
<BR>
decision.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I separate GM foods into those that are good for me, and those that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are good for agribusiness.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would argue that you may be splitting hairs.  Unless you argue
<BR>
that there is no benefit to the farmer (ultimately meaning no
<BR>
benefit to the consumer), then what is good for agribusiness is
<BR>
good for the *average* consumer.  If you define yourself as a consumer
<BR>
who *only* cares about nutritional content and not about price then
<BR>
I would agree that is a valid concern on your part but not one that
<BR>
should disallow others from making distinctions based on price.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still want all foods labeled, so I can make the decision.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If this were accompanied by a campaign by the government educating
<BR>
people as to the *real* differences in GM/non-GM foods and/or a
<BR>
public disclosure by &quot;green&quot; organizations on the true &quot;harms&quot; (if any)
<BR>
of GM foods, I would most likely be willing to agree with you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russia couldn't even make conventional agriculture work, so I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my doubts about any miracle GM cure. Anyway if people want to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GM foods I say fine. I just want them labeled so I know what in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Russia couldn't make &quot;industrial&quot; agriculture work.
<BR>
&quot;Self&quot;-agriculture works and is highly productive.  My only
<BR>
point was that when people see the savings/benefits provided
<BR>
by GM crops, then the &quot;green&quot; argument starts to seem strained.
<BR>
You have to realize that most &quot;personal&quot; farming done in Russia
<BR>
is *inherently* green already.  What people want is ways to increase
<BR>
the productivity/nutritional benefits of such farming.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your back to the &quot;people are to stupid to understand&quot; paternalism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to be able to separate GM foods created for enhanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutrition from those designed merely to make the most money for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agribusiness. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, from a market standpoint, we should be promoting nutri-benifits
<BR>
vs. simple production efficiencies.  However in other countries the
<BR>
production efficiencies may be more important than the nutri-benefits.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Are they safe? Corporations have limited liability remember.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about Bopohl (sp?) India, thalidomide?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm unsure of how this finally got resolved.  My general feeling
<BR>
would be that individuals should have been compensated for the
<BR>
harms they were exposed to.  Thalidomide is a good example to
<BR>
bring up.  Those cases dictated much of our current drug regulatory
<BR>
environment.  The problem is that there are drugs that are beneficial
<BR>
to minorities, that may be neutral or harmful to majorities that are
<BR>
now unavailable as a result of our previous history.  If you are going
<BR>
to adopt &quot;buyer beware&quot; with regard to tobacco (I'm not sure whether
<BR>
you intended this emphasis), then you must certainly extend it to
<BR>
drugs as well.  It raises some very interesting questions as to
<BR>
the degree of &quot;liability&quot; a company should be exposed to, if they
<BR>
have product that clearly benefits one segment of the population
<BR>
while harming another segment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I remember correctly Dr Bruce Ames said as much as 20% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weight of a fruit or vegetable are plant derived toxins. Plants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fight biological warfare.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite possibly.  Plants are at war with the bugs.  What most people
<BR>
do not realize is that some of those chemical weapons are carcinogenic.
<BR>
Entirely &quot;natural&quot; plants, that have been created over the millennia
<BR>
to be insect resistant are likely to contain high concentrations of
<BR>
these insecticides (carcinogens).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not for letting agribusiness off the hook on advertising by not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labeling their products.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Nor, am I in requiring the Greens to do full and open disclosure
<BR>
with regard to the &quot;weakness&quot; of their arguments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Like I've said I don't like the idea of Roundup soybeans, and like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a good little capitalist, I want to know products that contain it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I can vote against them by not purchasing them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not object to your right to make informed consumer decisions.
<BR>
Especially because they *are* informed.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I favor a very simple additional to the contents, like &quot;contains GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (37) soybeans.&quot; (37 being a made up number for Roundup) BHT,BHA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used muffler cores, clove cigarette butts, uranium mine tailings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Natural sea salt.....   ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The consumer could look up the appropriate info on their own.
</EM><BR>
<P>This type of approach would be acceptable, IMO, esp with a URL
<BR>
for the explanations page.  Since we have now crit/counter-crit
<BR>
it would be easy for the agri-business/greens to present their
<BR>
positions.
<BR>
<P>While you may dislike paternalism, I would argue that many people
<BR>
prefer having most of their decisions made for them.  Most people
<BR>
don't want to think about how pure their water is, they just want
<BR>
assurances that their water is safe.  Assurances always come with
<BR>
some cost.  Government &amp; regulatory agencies are out to strike
<BR>
a balance.
