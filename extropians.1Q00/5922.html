'What is your name?'  'Emlyn, onetel.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given the central idea that we are all really in a computer simulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without our knowledge, the whole show run by some external force, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you fix the plot to not be so dumb? You've got to scrap all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;outside the matrix; real world&quot; stuff, which was crap (the duracell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory). It's not allowed to become Terminator. It must be consistent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>My favorite strategy for plots is to steal one wholesale, ideally from
<BR>
Shakespeare.  Tried and true, that's why they work.  Here's a few
<BR>
examples:
<BR>
<P>* Some hacker discovers that the world is a simulation, and uses this fact
<BR>
to determine facts about his own future.  It predicts him murdering a
<BR>
powerful business executive (and taking his place), and killing others to
<BR>
prevent his secret from getting out; he finally gets himself killed as the
<BR>
computer gives him technically true but misleading information.  Emphasis
<BR>
on the determinacy of the simulation.
<BR>
<P>* Some people are running a simulation, complete with sim people, into
<BR>
which they upload?/download? for recreation.  They decide to edit the
<BR>
lives of the people within, by altering code in such a way as to cause a
<BR>
certian pair of couples to fall in love.  Mistakes are made, comedy
<BR>
ensues.  Emphasis on the unpredictability of coding in arbitrary
<BR>
directives.
<BR>
<P>* Within a simulation, a weak-minded military officer receives a message
<BR>
from someone outside the simulation, informing him that his superior, who
<BR>
has recently been promoted under mysterious circumstances, is actually a
<BR>
deadly criminal, who has uploaded into this simulation to avoid the death
<BR>
penalty.  The man receives orders to &quot;kill&quot; his superior, ejecting the
<BR>
criminal from the program, allowing him to be tried.  He hesitates doing
<BR>
so, and [at least appears to] go insane.  Fending off a number of attacks
<BR>
on his life, he ultimately &quot;kills&quot; his superior, though dying in the
<BR>
attempt.  Emphasis on epistemology of &quot;knowing&quot; you're in the simulation.
<BR>
[It'd be good to get the women in here somehow, but in thinking about it a
<BR>
little while, I'm not sure how one would do it. &lt;shrug&gt;]
<BR>
<P>Anyway, just a few thoughts.
