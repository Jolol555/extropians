Why can't we hope that super beings, when they reallly do exist, can find 
<BR>
better, less evil and painful ways to do all this like create some non 
<BR>
feeling abstract &quot;simulator&quot; to find out or accomplish whatever it is you 
<BR>
feel can not be done without real live and feeling beings going through all 
<BR>
this frustration and suffering!?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>But would we really learn then in an abstract and non-feeling simulator?  
<BR>
Perhaps a direct download into the brain that even changes neural pathways 
<BR>
could accomplish this?  Even our descendants may balk at this. Perhaps...  
<BR>
How about a sim that includes all the pain and frustration of the present 
<BR>
world for future generations that only know utopia?  I like that idea.  I 
<BR>
think suffering to achieve goals is important but starvation and chronic and 
<BR>
debilitating disease among other things is stark cruelty.  But again, from a 
<BR>
divine or extra-terrestrial mindset, it might be seen as sad but part of 
<BR>
life and over the long-term something that would be overcome.  No one ever 
<BR>
said life would always be fair, whether religionist, atheist or quietly 
<BR>
observing alien!  I know more personally about unfairness then many, but 
<BR>
there are legion who in the slums of the third-world could say I live very 
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Maybe if there isn't yet such Gods, Maybe if there isn't yet such super 
<BR>
smart ETs, then maybe, instead of spending all of our time trying to find 
<BR>
silly excuses like this to justify why they are hiding.  Instead of 
<BR>
irrationally trying to twist all this evil as if it were some how really 
<BR>
good, can't we hope that something better might be possible?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Rejection of belief in the supernatural to be replaced with a hope for a 
<BR>
utopian world through science and human cooperation?  Welcome to the 
<BR>
extropian list! lol  In some ways it is much easier to view this horrible 
<BR>
world through the eyes of an atheist.  Personally, I still have my beliefs 
<BR>
but just not a sure knowledge that I would love to have from an angelic 
<BR>
visit or a NDE.
<BR>
<P>you wrote:
<BR>
It seems to me that if there is not yet powerful beings like this, then we 
<BR>
can have hope that not only might it be possible to completely overcome 
<BR>
evil, but that we are on the verge of finally being able to do just that.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Will evil/injustice ever be totally eliminated?  I seriously doubt that but 
<BR>
it would be nice.  I tend to think there will always be a serpent in the 
<BR>
garden, a Marc Remillard, a Anakin Skywalker, a Stalin, that wishes to use 
<BR>
powerful abilities and influence to their own brutal and selfish ends.  Will 
<BR>
the mind children of humanity overcome our present failings?
<BR>
<P>A french scientist of yesteryear said that Christ would return before 
<BR>
humanity discovered all the keys to open the doors to all God's secrets, 
<BR>
which would lead to our own destruction due to human nature.  We will see...
<BR>
