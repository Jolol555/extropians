<EM>&gt; The Christian on the other hand... only cares to preserve the meme of God's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;mysterious ways&quot;, in other words, non-interference by man. They fear being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused to question their ideas, and would easily discount even the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical argument for technology, if it threatened the meme itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>Something to remember about religion:  Outside of this particular
<BR>
mailing list, the fundamental logical, ethical, and moral abstracts a
<BR>
person claims to espouse has surprisingly little impact on their
<BR>
behavior or personality.  Kind and generous people who espouse Christian
<BR>
beliefs remain kind and generous people who may happen to rationalize
<BR>
their kindness and generosity using Christian frameworks; mean and nasty
<BR>
people who espouse Christian beliefs will rationalize their meanness and
<BR>
nastiness using Christian frameworks.  The same, broadly speaking,
<BR>
probably goes for agnostics who were raised in agnostic families, albeit
<BR>
to a lesser degree.
<BR>
<P>Yes, the abstracts make a difference, but *how much* of a difference
<BR>
they make is a variable, not a constant; it depends on the individual. 
<BR>
My rule of thumb is that I can reason effectively about a domain when
<BR>
reasoning that has told me something I didn't know, or contradicted
<BR>
something I would have preferred to be true.  Since my abstracts have
<BR>
that kind of power, they hold a great deal of influence over my behavior.
<BR>
<P>One path to agnosticism is for your reasoning skills to force you to
<BR>
acknowledge uncomfortable facts about your belief system.  Therefore,
<BR>
knowing that someone is an agnostic can be Bayesian evidence that they,
<BR>
or at least their parents, could be commanded by abstracts.  Most of the
<BR>
time, however, whether abstracts command or simply flow with the
<BR>
preconceptions is a time-dependent, context-dependent, and
<BR>
individual-dependent variable, whose population-average value for
<BR>
complex, non-concrete belief systems is currently weighted more towards
<BR>
&quot;flow&quot; than &quot;command&quot;.
<BR>
<P>This population average reflects, not the moral weakness of the average
<BR>
human, but the laws governing memetic ecology.  Given the human tendency
<BR>
to pay attention to assertions that resonate with, or justify, what we
<BR>
want to believe, and the human ability to just not think about
<BR>
assertions that produce dissonance, meme-systems tend to evolve to
<BR>
contain an abstract but emotionally resonant potpourri that an average
<BR>
human with average rationalizing ability can use to justify almost
<BR>
anything.  Since these meme-systems are presently dominant, most humans
<BR>
grow up with such a meme-system, and the population average is weighted
<BR>
more towards &quot;flow&quot; than &quot;command&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Thus good people who happen to be Christians remain good people, and bad
<BR>
people who happen to be Christians remain bad people.  The same often
<BR>
holds true of technically agnostic or atheistic belief systems that have
<BR>
evolved to contain more than a certain amount of belief-content.
