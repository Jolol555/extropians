In CA, you can be jailed for carrying _concealed_ anything &quot;capable of
<BR>
ready use&quot; as a stabbing instrument which can cause grave injury or
<BR>
death. It's a &quot;wobbler&quot;, meaning they can charge you with either a
<BR>
misdemeanor or a felony, depending on how the cop(s)/DA(s) are feeling.
<BR>
<P>So carry on a tool belt is probably OK, as long as other clothes don't
<BR>
cover it. But put it in a toolbox, and *bang*--under the law, it's a
<BR>
crime to carry. As with many stupid laws, it's likely to only be an
<BR>
add-on charge *after* you do something bad--*unless* someone decides to
<BR>
&quot;selectively enforce&quot; your ass just 'cause they feel like it. Which, as
<BR>
we know, *never* happens in LA or anywhere else in the Land of the Free. 
<BR>
<P>MMB
<BR>
<P>Carry in your hand, in what someone decides to construe as a menacing
<BR>
manner, and you've got a heap of other laws to run afoul of.

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Surely that's only if you're caught running with them? ö¿ö

<EM>&gt; &gt; In Los Angeles, you can be jailed for carrying a screwdriver.

<EM>&gt; Is it a crime by definition, or a crime if it is deemed an offensive weapon?

<EM>&gt; In many countries carrying an offensive weapon is a crime, and this can be

<EM>&gt; anything including a piece of rope if you are a tuggie.

<EM>&gt; In NSW, it is a crime per-se
