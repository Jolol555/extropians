<P><EM>&gt; This research is REALLY exciting.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes indeed. Those of us on CR [1] look forward to the day when the benefits of
<BR>
the diet can be reaped without the hassles of the diet. (Why more
<BR>
life-extensionists aren't on the diet remains a puzzle to me. Scientific
<BR>
optimism is a big part of it, from what I've gathered; dislike of dieting being
<BR>
an obvious additional factor.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; What's just as interesting, though, is how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously careful the researchers were to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say that they WEREN'T trying to extend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human life-span, but only the period of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health and vitality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. This was fascinating. The care going into such statements has increased
<BR>
greatly in the last year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's obvious to me that folks doing the real work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this area are truly afraid to talk about increases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in human longevity as their goal.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Surprisingly, though, many (though not most) scientists say the same thing
<BR>
privately that they say publicly, i.e., they, in fact, are not interested in
<BR>
extending human life span. Seems odd to me. But the science is quite fascinating
<BR>
in and of itself, and some of these researchers are simply jazzed about their
<BR>
work per se, and that's it. Could have an impact on political decisions that
<BR>
will be made in the future about this, though....
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
