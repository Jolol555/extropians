Do you ever get the feeling that just plain ol' luck is behind much of what 
<BR>
happens in life? Are the Bill Joys, Alfred Noyces, Bill Gateses, etc, really 
<BR>
supreme geniuses, or did they just win some kind of global lottery. No 
<BR>
question, that when opportunity knocks, you have to get up and answer the 
<BR>
door. But you also have to live in the right neighborhood, and be at home at 
<BR>
the time. You could add to that, your parents answering the irrespective 
<BR>
doors before you, and their parents before them. An amazing string of sevens 
<BR>
at the cosmic crap table leads to the founding of a Sun Microsystems, an 
<BR>
Intel, or a Microsoft.

<P>Now why can't we all have a wife that inspires such billion-dollar making 
<BR>
ideas as eBay?
<BR>
<P>eBay history taken from official website:
<BR>
eBay was conceived initially as a result of a conversation between Pierre 
<BR>
Omidyar and his wife, an avid Pez™ collector (she currently covets a 
<BR>
collection of more than 400 dispensers). She commented to Pierre how great 
<BR>
it would be if she were able to collect Pez dispensers and interact with 
<BR>
other collectors over the Internet.
<BR>
<P>As an early Internet enthusiast, Pierre knew that people needed a central 
<BR>
location to buy and sell unique items and to meet other users with similar 
<BR>
interests. He started eBay to fulfill this need.
<BR>
<P>Pierre launched eBay on Labor Day in September 1995.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>It sounds to me like you need the brains, the education, and the luck and 
<BR>
foresight to be in the right place at the right time, not to mention in his 
<BR>
case his own personal muse! :)  I bet every time he looks at his wife's Pez 
<BR>
collection his heart is warmed.
<BR>
<P>Jeff continues:
<BR>
Enjoy this momentary return to the spotlight, Bill, cause it looks like 
<BR>
puffery to me, and not likely to last.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Considering Bill Joy's position, I think he will have continued access to 
<BR>
the mass media to share his thoughts.  And I think he may have 'cleared the 
<BR>
way' for other leaders in high-tech to speak scarily of the future.  As the 
<BR>
realization of AI, nanotech and bio-engineering comes closer to us I see 
<BR>
more Bill Joy-type people coming forth to give warning.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
