<P>Well, according to my charts we don't &quot;really&quot; hit the limits until

2030-2040 (when we are dealing with single atom layers/wires).  But

if we get nanoassembly around 2010, 2015 might be right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Start by replacing silicon doped with impurities with carbon doped with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impurities. Smaller atoms!
</EM><BR>
<P>There is work being done on using diamond as a semiconductor material.
<BR>
The problem is &quot;building&quot; the diamond without nanoassembly.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If that isn't enough, you need to replace the electrons in your carbon

<EM>&gt; &gt;atoms' outer orbitals with muons. Buggered if I know how you'd stabilize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them for long enough, but their relatively high mass (several hundred times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that of an electron) would shrink the orbitals right down so that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;density of your muonized-carbon crystals would rival that of degenerate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;matter -- but it would be structurally and electronically similar to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;carbon.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm.... One of our physics experts is going to have to explain this
<BR>
to me before I agree.  Using &quot;classical&quot; physics, the orbit of the
<BR>
orbiting &quot;particle&quot; depends largely on the mass being orbited
<BR>
(considering the nucleus the &quot;sun&quot; and the electrons the &quot;planets&quot;).
<BR>
I would agree that larger masses (muons vs. electrons) should &quot;orbit&quot;
<BR>
closer, but to my knowledge electron/muon &quot;orbits&quot; do not depend on gravity.
<BR>
Any coments???

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You can stabilize muons by Fermi blocking.  (This is how neutrons in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;neutron stars are stabilized.)  All this requires is that the muons be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;confined inside a degenerate Fermi gas of electrons, with a Fermi level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;higher than the kinetic energy of an electron produced in muon decay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;[snip2] 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So, short of a neutron star (or stable strange matter), you're never going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to stabilize muons in a lab.                                                    
</EM><BR>
Well, I just happen to have Chapter 18 from Xenology sitting on my
<BR>
desk [Alien Weapons...] and according to *it*, you can stabalize
<BR>
Muons and Pions by increasing their energy.  Bump a 1 MeV pion
<BR>
(decays in 1m) to 10TeV and its travel time is 540 km.  My
<BR>
suspicion (since the text isn't quite clear) is that this comes
<BR>
from increasing the velocity (perhaps slowing down decay times
<BR>
at near c velocities?).  So we come down to making the muons/pions
<BR>
orbit the nucleus *really* fast (which I guess means you want to make
<BR>
the nucleus really heavy).  I would guess that gets into an entirely
<BR>
new set of problems.
<BR>
<P>Alternatively you could use electrons and positrons orbiting each
<BR>
other.  I believe this have been constructed, though I'm unsure
<BR>
of the dimensions.  Presumably it would be much smaller than atoms.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately though I think you want to get rid of the nucleus entirely
<BR>
and do your computing with things that are massless (photons) or
<BR>
nearly so (neutrinos).  Thats the only way you are going to get
<BR>
the density *really* high and the communications delays very low.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately posts by Eugene seem to suggest to me that controlling
<BR>
this stuff is going to be difficult.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, back to Charlie:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which leads me to daydream aloud on the Extropians list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lightspeed signal propagation delays should be a lot less significant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too, everything being so much closer together. (As far as circuit design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes, it's a bit like the consequences of raising the speed of light.)
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  But the ultimate minimization of the propagation delays would
<BR>
utilize light as the information carrier.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have adequate references to hand, but would a red dwarf or black
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dwarf also suffice?
</EM><BR>
<P>A red dwarf is a very small, long-lived star with normal matter so it
<BR>
clearly doesn't qualify.  The literature is fuzzy re: &quot;black dwarfs&quot;
<BR>
which may be either &quot;brown dwarfs&quot; (unignited stars) or burned out
<BR>
&quot;white dwarfs&quot; (remnants of stellar evolution).  The brown dwarfs
<BR>
are largely normal H/He and the post-white dwarfs are layered stellar
<BR>
cores, probably with a lot of normal C/O and maybe some N/Ne/He with
<BR>
an H atmosphere, but in both cases they have a fairly normal (nondegenerate)
<BR>
atomic structure.
<BR>
<P>So, I would say, no, they do not suffice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so, that environment might be accessible to assembler-built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools controlled by an MB. Instead of needing to employ starlifting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get extra material for use in an MB, the MB could directly colonise the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stellar remnant.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a good argument that white dwarfs are the &quot;gold&quot; in the hills
<BR>
of universe (due to the high C concentrations).  The problem is that
<BR>
you have to import H to provide energy.  Same thing is true of
<BR>
neutron stars...  Gee that matter density is nice, but where do
<BR>
you get the energy from?
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if I asked or if anyone ever responded to, but the
<BR>
question of what a photon does when it strikes a neutron star
<BR>
remains an interesting question to me....  As does the problem
<BR>
of the &quot;lifetime&quot; of neutron stars.  While the neutrons in the
<BR>
center may be constrained from decaying, I doubt the same is true
<BR>
for neutrons on the surface.  That would suggest that neutron
<BR>
stars should evaporate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The point here is that an MB that extends all the way down _into_ the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface of a black dwarf has access to vastly more structured matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for computation purposes -- 10 to 1000 Jovian masses doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unreasonable -- and also doesn't suffer from the same sort of lightspeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propagation lag as an MB with dimensions measured in AU's.
</EM><BR>
<P>You *always* have the lightspeed limit, but I agree that removing the
<BR>
star at the center of an MBrain and replacing it with computronium
<BR>
produces the highest density computing capacity.  The problem then
<BR>
becomes how do you pump energy in and heat out?
<BR>
<P>As noted from Anders recent Jnl of TH paper, in the Appendix, under
<BR>
Jupiter Brains...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The main limiting factors in this design is the availability of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carbon, the material strength of diamond and the need of keeping
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the system cool.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The carbon can be harvested from white dwarfs, the material strength
<BR>
of diamond can be solved using momentum support (from &quot;The Cuckoo&quot;)
<BR>
but the problem of removing the heat and keeping the system cool
<BR>
*doesn't* go away.  (And Anders carefully avoids the cooling costs...)
<BR>
Also, if you remove sources of internal power generation, you have the
<BR>
problem of beaming power &quot;into&quot; the computronium.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So it can think _faster_ than a normal MB, and probably has more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources at its disposal -- in return for being stuck at the bottom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a very deep gravity well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this feasible in principle, or am I missing something?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Nope, not missing anything.  Being at the bottom of a gravity well
<BR>
doesn't matter much to a being that presumably navigates itself
<BR>
&quot;en masse&quot; around the galaxy and communicates with massless photons.
<BR>
<P>Anders does discuss the computational rates of nuclear matter
<BR>
in his Neutronium brain and points out the problems of increasing
<BR>
the matter density too much.
<BR>
<P>For reference purposes a Matrioska Brain of my design probably falls
<BR>
between Anders' Dyson brain &quot;Uranos&quot; and Neutronium Brain &quot;Chronos&quot;
<BR>
with an emphasis on power efficiency and heat removal (vis-a-vis
<BR>
some of the optimizations Anders makes).
<BR>
<P>Charlie's suggested sun-less MBrain with comp-muon-onium is an enhancement
<BR>
in the evolution of MBrains towards NBrains.  We shall henceforth
<BR>
call this a muonium-based MBrain (mMBrain)...
<BR>
<P>Finally, its worth noting that Xenology says the decay time of a muon
<BR>
is 2.2 microseconds (at non-c speeds presumably) and you can do a lot
<BR>
of computation in 2.2 mu-sec.  The problem is to develop a system that
<BR>
regenerates the mu-matter as fast as it decays.
