<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;From The Ottawa Citizen Online,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;<A HREF="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/national/991226/3348268.html">http://www.ottawacitizen.com/national/991226/3348268.html</A>

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If such cloning worked exactly they should, theoretically, have been
</EM><BR>
carbon
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;copies of each other. In reality, a host of other factors have conspired
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;make them into unique individuals. Mr. Campbell is unable to say exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the animals differ: research into the causes has not been done. High
</EM><BR>
among
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the possibilities is the fact that the four-cell nuclei from which they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;created were placed into egg cells taken from different female sheep.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Duh!  I don't think you have to look further...
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not as much as a &quot;Duh!&quot; as you think.  It is was currently believed
<BR>
that DNA defines an animal's appearance and much of its personality.  These
<BR>
clones had identical DNA and different egg cells.  The egg cells were
<BR>
thought to be empty containers to hold the DNA.  Now that the animals look
<BR>
and act different, it appears that DNA is not the end-all blueprint that we
<BR>
thought it was.  Apparently, much of the animals definition comes from
<BR>
non-DNA sources.
<BR>
<P>This throws much of our assumptions about genetics out the window.  It means
<BR>
that characteristics of children come from the parents via other mechanisms
<BR>
in addition to DNA.  It means that a complete mapping of human DNA genome
<BR>
still won't give us complete control over a child's characteristics.
<BR>
Scanning fetal DNA won't be able to detect all birth defects, or even all
<BR>
birth defects inherited from the parents.
<BR>
<P>This is a major problem for genetics and biology.  We have to develop an
<BR>
extension to genetics that track trait inheritance outside of DNA.  This
<BR>
also is a problem for cloning replacement organs.  What if we get an exact
<BR>
DNA match, and the organs are still rejected by the body as being alien?  We
<BR>
thought we were very close to understanding most of genetics, with the
<BR>
mapping of the human genome.  It now appears that there are more inheritance
<BR>
pathways to map, and we don't even know where they are or how they work.
