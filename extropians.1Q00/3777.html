<P><P>I've been pushing Amazon privately on the patent issue since January,
<BR>
but after not getting much traction, I went public with the following
<BR>
statement, which includes my formerly private email to Jeff Bezos, and
<BR>
some associated commentary, as well as an open letter to Amazon that I'm
<BR>
asking people to sign:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/amazon_patent.html">http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/amazon_patent.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Obviously, I thought a lot about this before taking a public stance,
<BR>
since Amazon is now one of our largest customers, but in the end, I
<BR>
believe that if I didn't speak up, and let myself be intimidated by
<BR>
Amazon's market power, then other less technically savvy publishers
<BR>
would also be silent.  As Edmund Burke said, &quot;All that is required for
<BR>
evil to triumph is that good men do nothing.&quot;  I don't want to say by
<BR>
that quotation that Amazon is evil, but they are certainly misguided and
<BR>
short-sighted, and we are all equally short-sighted if we stand by and
<BR>
do nothing.  Trivial and overly broad software patents are a great
<BR>
danger to the entire future of the Internet.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to urge anyone with an interest in the subject to sign on to
<BR>
the petition referenced from this page, and I'd particularly like to
<BR>
urge any publishers who do substantial business with Amazon to speak up
<BR>
as I have.  They need to hear from all of us that what they are doing
<BR>
doesn't just hurt their competitors, it hurts their customers and their
<BR>
suppliers as well.
