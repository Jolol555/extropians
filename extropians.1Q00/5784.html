<EM>&gt; IMO, far more concerning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than overpopulation would be the development of robotics or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sub-AI that eliminates the needs for employing a large fraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the population.  If we assume, for the moment, that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the people on this list fall into the &quot;above average&quot; segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the population (in intelligence, education, awareness, etc.),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't that give you pause to ask, just what does the &quot;below average&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment of the population do?  And what will happen when they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be replaced by a reliable 24-hour-a-day robot/AI?
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me that people above average in intelligence are in far more
<BR>
danger of being replaced than below average.  To replace a knowledge
<BR>
worker requires only a relatively smart AI.  To replace a janitor
<BR>
requires not only an AI, it requires a robot with sensors, motors,
<BR>
structural components, mechanical flexibility and versatility, and it's
<BR>
gotta be CHEAP.
<BR>
<P>Once you have an AI travel agent, say, you can replace all travel agents
<BR>
just by copying bits.  But an AI janitor requires you to build a new
<BR>
clanking machine for each guy you want to replace.  It's a much more
<BR>
expensive proposition.
<BR>
<P>And there is a good chance that most of the skills we humans associate
<BR>
with intelligence, like designing ICs or diagnosing illness, are actually
<BR>
easier to do than the things we think are trivial, like walking and
<BR>
picking up trashcans and emptying them out.
<BR>
<P>I would not be too smug about being irreplaceable just because we think
<BR>
we are &quot;above average&quot;.  Picture a future where smart AIs do all the
<BR>
intellectual work far less expensively than people could, while humans
<BR>
are the drones doing the physical labor, flesh and blood being too cheap
<BR>
to be worth replacing with metal.
