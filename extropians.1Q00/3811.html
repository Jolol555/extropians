&nbsp;Err, you have missed the whole amalgam debacle, have you? UV cured
<BR>
&nbsp;polymer doesn't age well, cements are also inferior.

<BR>
&nbsp;So far Au is still gold standard in dental materials. Maybe
<BR>
&nbsp;aesthetically less than perfect, but toxicologically uncontroversial
<BR>
&nbsp;and damn durable. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Excuse me, but as a cosmetic dentist for 20 years, with an undergraduate 
<BR>
materials degree in engineering, I just might have a modicum more information 
<BR>
and experience with dental restorative materials than you.  Au is NOT the 
<BR>
standard in dental materials.  It was... 50 years ago, but believe it or not, 
<BR>
dental technology has actually significantly advanced since 1950!  And your 
<BR>
quote, 'the polymer doesn't age well'.  I, like most dentists, have been 
<BR>
using polymers for years and years, and I would choose a polymer restorative 
<BR>
way over dental gold, or amalgams anytime.  In fact, if you've attended any 
<BR>
continuing education dental class in dental materials over the past 10 years, 
<BR>
you would know that amalgam is the last thing to use because it simply cracks 
<BR>
teeth and induces leakage.  
<BR>
For example, everyday, I'll show patients a 25x view of their teeth on the TV 
<BR>
monitor, with my intraoral camera, and freeze-frame it.  You would be amazed 
<BR>
how much cracking, leaking, wear, and recurrent decay is under most large old 
<BR>
fillings.  They are walking timebombs for future crowns and endodontia, but 
<BR>
that is another subject altogether.
<BR>
<P>Finally, you mentioned that cements are inferior, regarding polymers.  Your 
<BR>
facts are rather jumbled, as a dentist does not generally use cements under 
<BR>
polymer restorative materials anyway.  They use a luting agent which is 
<BR>
bonded on.
