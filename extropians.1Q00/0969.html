<EM>&gt; Do you think an end of aging tomorrow would be good for the human species as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a whole? I know extropians don't have any ecological concerns but I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you were different. Do you really think space is the only boundary to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population increase?

<P>If we ended aging *tomorrow* (January 19, 2000), the population growth
<BR>
rate would only increase marginally.  It would take decades for the
<BR>
increases to get compounded into a serious problem.  By that time
<BR>
I expect that (a) people would discover en masse the validity
<BR>
of reasons for vacating the planet, or (b) why longevity is not
<BR>
such a good idea.
<BR>
<P>Now whether ending aging tomorrow would be &quot;good for the species as
<BR>
a whole&quot; depends a lot on whether you think having your expectations
<BR>
of your future life *ripped* from your mind and sliced and diced
<BR>
on the meme-cutting-room-floor.  *Most* people would consider that
<BR>
bad.  Of course I'm not very interested in &quot;dying&quot; for &quot;most&quot; people.
<BR>
(After all, what have they done for *me* lately....)
<BR>
<P>I disagree, that extropians don't have &quot;ecological concerns&quot;.
<BR>
I consider myself a highly &quot;ecological&quot; person in that, if possible,
<BR>
I don't want to have to expend resources tomorrow cleaning up
<BR>
any mess I made today (unless someone can show me concretely
<BR>
that &quot;tomorrow&quot; cleanups are cheaper than &quot;today&quot; cleanups).
<BR>
As I expect that analysis is problematic, it makes sense to
<BR>
me to cleanup today and enjoy the &quot;good life&quot; tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>Re: population increase, a lot comes down to the degree to which
<BR>
either individuals want (a) unlimited self-copies or (b) cross-pollenization
<BR>
between individuals producing offspring in a simple and &quot;inexpensive&quot;
<BR>
fashion.  Real, physical reproduction is going to be horribly
<BR>
slow vis-a-vis the growth in the resource base per person
<BR>
unless (a) or (b) arrives to unbalance things [As Robin has
<BR>
discussed in his papers.]
<BR>
<P>If the bodies are physical, the limits are more &quot;real&quot; than if the
<BR>
bodies are virtual (primarily due to the fact that &quot;suspending&quot;
<BR>
virtual bodies is easy, while &quot;suspending&quot; real bodies is problematic.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately even the virtual body count runs into matter and energy limits.
<BR>
<P>But overall, I think we transcend this planet, long before we
<BR>
reach its carrying capacity (with &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; technology).
<BR>
<P>If that doesn't respond to your questions, I'd ask you to
<BR>
rephrase them.
