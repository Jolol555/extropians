I use a polymeric material called Belle Glass.  I have placed well over 1000 
<BR>
of these crowns in the past 4-5 years, and perhaps 3 of them have had some 
<BR>
sensitivity/leakage problems.  That is substantially lower than the much 
<BR>
higher rate of failure with other types.  Belle Glass has been around for 
<BR>
about 6-7 years in the United States.  If your dentist used something earlier 
<BR>
than that, chances are that the failure rate would have been higher.  
<BR>
Gold is in itself not that bad, and yes, I've placed numerous gold onlays and 
<BR>
crowns, without a hitch.  The Belle Glass is similar to the old Gold onlays 
<BR>
in that you do not have to grind the tooth down to a nub anymore.  And they 
<BR>
look so much more cosmetic than gold.  
<BR>
<P>Also, since the margins of these newer polymer crowns are ABOVE the gum 
<BR>
margin, there is little periodontal problems associated with them.  Except 
<BR>
for Gold onlays, full Gold crowns (is that what you had?)  have the same 
<BR>
problem as regular porcelain crowns- they can induce future gum problems.  
<BR>
Fortunately or unfortunately, since gum disease is usually painless, one's 
<BR>
crowns may feel fine, but the underlying destruction of the foundation (i.e., 
<BR>
the gum tissue, surrounding jaw bone) could be deteriorating without the 
<BR>
patient even knowing it.  Not so with the newer polymer crowns!
