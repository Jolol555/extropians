<P><EM>&gt; What I'm wondering is this:  Might we have a large number of

<EM>&gt; abnormal mental architectures on this list because such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anomalies force us to learn cognitive 'tricks' thus creating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an interest in our own abilities, their limits, and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential for improvement?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure there is a certain truth to this. I have a friend, the smartest 
<BR>
person I've ever met by a very wide margin, who seems (at least to me) to 
<BR>
have developed his intelligence in response to some very strange 
<BR>
neurological wiring. He just doesn't seem to have much of the low-level 
<BR>
mental processing that so many of us rely upon to get through the day. The 
<BR>
result, as far as I can figure out, is that he was forced to develop his 
<BR>
brain because he spends more mental energy just walking down the street 
<BR>
than I do working on a math problem. (As I discovered the last time I 
<BR>
tried to follow him over badly broken ground. Since he's having to do foot-
<BR>
placement calculations anyway, the fact that the terrain is terrible 
<BR>
doesn't slow him down.) One of the by-products of this is that he doesn't 
<BR>
get caught up in many common fallacies that come from using an intuition 
<BR>
(or hard-wired calculation) in a context in which it isn't valid. Since he 
<BR>
always does things the 'hard way', and has had to construct his own 
<BR>
internal algorithms, he searches hard to find general problem solving 
<BR>
techniques in his daily life, to reduce his mental burden. This has made 
<BR>
him a really great generalist, and a crack problem solver. 
<BR>
<P>Of course, there are also a number of disadvantages to being wired the way 
<BR>
he is, but I've often wondered just what it must be like to live in that 
<BR>
skull of his.
