<EM>&gt; Just a little bit you might find interesting-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have a new photo of engine testing up on our page below, under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Current Projects&quot;.  I took the photo with a handheld spotlight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illuminating the engine to prevent the brilliance of the plume from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; washing out the image.  I had to hold the lamp so close to the exhaust I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could feel the thrust on the lamp!  The bolts and the vertical line to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right side of the image are parts of a lexan/aluminum blast shield
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure just in case we have a bad day, since I was about a meter from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the engine while it was firing.  The noise at that distance is 144 dBA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so earplugs *and* muffs are a good idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The plume is much brighter than it appears in this image, since I had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit too much external illumination- the incandescent lamp also shifted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the color balance, and the plume is not quite so bluish.  One of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Ya had to be there&quot; things, but we should be doing public demos at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various conferences in a few months (shameless plug).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool stuff. Y'know, if the x-1 project is still looking for funding you
<BR>
might talk to Stacey &quot;Scootch&quot; Prineas of Seattle. He put together $5
<BR>
million back in the late 80s and early 90s to build a TA-4J from three
<BR>
hulks and a guatemalan Air Force surplus jet engine. Scootch is a funny
<BR>
guy, I saved his plane (and all of our asses) one day when they were
<BR>
doing the first engine test. The crew cheif or somebody had dropped a
<BR>
screw driver in the intake during his intake inspection. I spotted it
<BR>
rattling around in the intake screen during rev up as the engine rotor
<BR>
had kicked it back up. He thanked me by taking me out and getting me so
<BR>
drunk I couldn't get out of bed for a couple days...  some thanks... I
<BR>
didn't think that was any better than getting blown to kingdom come by
<BR>
several thousand pounds of fuel at the time.
<BR>
Anyways, since those days he has done some deals with Ollie North and
<BR>
Adnan Kashoggi, so he might be someone to talk to.
