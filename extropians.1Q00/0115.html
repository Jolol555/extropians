NASA Y2K Status Report for 5 p.m. EST (2200 UTC) Jan. 3, 2000
<BR>
<P>The first business day of the Year 2000 turned up no significant problems in 
<BR>
NASA information technology systems. A few small glitches were found in 
<BR>
business systems that had not been used since before the Y2K rollover, but 
<BR>
they were quickly identified and fixed.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The NASA Y2K team should take pride in what has been a truly extraordinary 
<BR>
accomplishment,&quot; said NASA Chief Information Officer Lee Holcomb, who 
<BR>
oversaw the Agency's Y2K effort. &quot;As of today, NASA has transitioned 
<BR>
successfully to the Year 2000 with no significant  problems. The  few minor 
<BR>
anomalies that arose were easily fixed and we have closed them all out.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Only two space-related systems suffered problems that appeared to be Y2K-
<BR>
related, but neither problem directly affected real-time mission-critical 
<BR>
systems. 
<BR>
One problem occurred in software used to plan communications opportunities 
<BR>
between the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and the Tracking and Data 
<BR>
Relay Satellite System. The other occurred in orbital-prediction software 
<BR>
used 
<BR>
by NASA's Deep Space Network. Workarounds for both problems were 
<BR>
developed over the weekend.
<BR>
<P>Unless events warrant otherwise, this will be the last Y2K Status Report for 
<BR>
NASA.
