<P><P><EM>&gt;  &lt;&gt;  The &quot;gun ban&quot; WAS a temporary measure, &lt;--------snip------------------&gt;
</EM><BR>
The temporary moratorium had NOTHING to do with the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  subject matter and EVERYTHING to do with the way that the list was being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  abused.
</EM><BR>
<P>So all topics are still fair game....gotcha...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &lt;&gt;  EvMick, as ExI's officer charged with enforcing that temporary policy, 
</EM><BR>
I  
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  was required to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; you when you 1) failed to observe the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temporary   moratorium on gun discussions and 2) failed to reply to my 
</EM><BR>
private 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  correspondence on the matter.  I am certain that the reason for this was 
</EM><BR>
the  
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  irregular nature of your contact with the net in the first instance, and a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  full mailbox in the second.  Although I therefore had good reason to 
</EM><BR>
believe  
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  your transgression was completely unintentional, I had no choice but to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enforce the terms of the moratorium against you.  I was sorry to do so and 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;am 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  glad you're back on the list.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Glad to hear that.  For the record I'll explain.  Sometimes I get on the net 
<BR>
frequently...othertimes there are great lapses.  (on the average it's at 
<BR>
least weekly)....however Montana, N.Dakota and that part of the country have 
<BR>
little or no truck available internet access.
<BR>
<P>I recall that during the JoeDee Flame war i got Waaaaaaaaaay behind on my 
<BR>
mail.  My mailbox was full frequently.  I tried using a FIFO method of 
<BR>
reading and commenting but I got further and further behind.  I suppose that 
<BR>
i was commenting on posts that were days if not weeks old.  In other words I 
<BR>
was making comments after the &quot;ban' but unaware of the ban because i hadn't 
<BR>
got that far yet.  Of course i may have missed it altogether because if my 
<BR>
mail box is full then i never get the email.
<BR>
<P>Anywho...glad that's all taken care of.
<BR>
<P>However ....I do hold kind of a record I suppose...
<BR>
<P>I was kicked out of Sunday School once for asking difficult questions.  Now 
<BR>
I've been kicked off the Extropian list also.  (heh heh)
