<P><EM>&gt; Right.  What my opposition seems not to realize is that the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *already* has the ability to conduct surveillance on us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  But dont think of Mike as your opposition.  We're among
<BR>
friends here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  In my city there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are cameras on all the freeways and almost all the intersections.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They have thermal vision devices that can track my movement inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my home while they are out in the street.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you been to Fry's lately?  Those cool night-vision thingies
<BR>
are cheap!  I woulda bought one if I could figure out a use for
<BR>
one.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  In some cities microphones are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being installed on grids throughout the city to listen for and pinpoint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gunshots.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are coming from Mike's house, shooting down my pet wasps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are spy satellites right now in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sky that can show what color shirt you are wearing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets fool em by not wearing one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So really all I'm asking for is the ability to look back at them.  Funny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing is that these guys who would deny me the right to keep an eye on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government like that probably think of themselves as libertarians!
</EM><BR>
<P>I think of myself as libertarian.  I am suggesting that whatever info
<BR>
is available to government be made available to anyone who
<BR>
wants it.  Remove all laws that can be removed.  Universal surveillance
<BR>
makes a whole bunch of laws unnecessary.  spike
