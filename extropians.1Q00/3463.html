<P>
During a recent deep-think, I have refined a previously posted idea.
<BR>
<P>Suppose we sharpen the information game to the following:
<BR>
<P>A group of 20 players posts a list of characteristics about themselves
<BR>
along with their game-identities.  From this group of twenty,
<BR>
three players, Alpha, Bravo and Charlie, with an all-knowing,
<BR>
all-seeing, no-talking referee Delta, conduct a friendly competition
<BR>
under the following conditions, after each ante-ing up 100 dollars:
<BR>
<P>0)  Alpha tries to send Charlie a piece of information, working
<BR>
only thru their mutual friend Bravo, without knowing the identity
<BR>
of Charlie.  Alpha is simultaneously attempting to ascertain the
<BR>
identity of Charlie.
<BR>
<P>1) Charlie attempts to ascertain the information while denying
<BR>
it to Bravo, who is also trying to get the information.
<BR>
<P>2)  Messages passed from Alpha to Charlie or back again
<BR>
pass unchanged thru Bravo.  Alpha and Charlie may query
<BR>
each other, however Charlie wishes to hide her identity from
<BR>
Alpha, as part of the game.
<BR>
<P>3)  This works like the popular board game &quot;Clue&quot; in which
<BR>
any of the three players may appeal to Delta at any time to
<BR>
adjudicate the outcome.  In general, the first player to submit
<BR>
a correct piece of information to Delta wins 200, and the other two
<BR>
players split the remaining 100.  If any player submits an incorrect
<BR>
piece of information, she wins nada and the remaining two players
<BR>
split the 300 clams.
<BR>
<P>4)  The exception is thus: as previously stated, Alpha is sending
<BR>
a piece of info to an unknown Charlie thru known Bravo without
<BR>
Bravo discovering the info.  If Alpha successfully passes the
<BR>
info to Charlie and Charlie submits same to Delta and is
<BR>
found to be correct, Charlie wins 150 and Alpha gets 150.
<BR>
If Bravo intercepts the info and submits before Charlie, then
<BR>
Bravo gets 200 and Alpha and Charlie get 50 each.
<BR>
<P>5)  Any player may choose to end the round at any time, at
<BR>
which time each player receives their ante 100 back.
<BR>
<P>With these six rules, is there a means of encoding or some
<BR>
winning strategy?  Is it clear that any of the three players has
<BR>
an advantage?  How can the ante/payoff matrix be modified to
<BR>
make the game equitable?  spike
