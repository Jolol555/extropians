Hi Frank !, 
<BR>
nice to meet you again, by the way !
<BR>
<P>On Thu, 13 Jan 2000, Frank Prengel wrote:

<P><EM>&gt; 1. It is well known (I think :) that in many circumstances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *pessimism* is a better tool for success 
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree, I maintain that (rational) optimism (which is different from 
<BR>
naivete') is *always* a better tool for success.  Disprove it. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - especially when it comes to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific research where *criticizing*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypotheses is highly necessary. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that criticizing hypotheses *is* highly necessary in science (as well 
<BR>
as in other areas of life, I think), but that doesn't say that for example 
<BR>
criticizing hypotheses is the *most important* goal or thing. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (That's what science is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about: make hypotheses and try to disprove them.)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I think that the goal which people try to achieve in science through this 
<BR>
process (of making hypotheses and trying to disprove them) is not to falsify 
<BR>
or disprove hypotheses, but a more positive goal, namely: to find new useful 
<BR>
hypotheses that work ! 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I feel that LIVING D.O. is more advanced than just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THINKING optimistically.  You can do the latter and still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fail to put it into practice, but hardly vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever. It is just an arbitrary epithet labelling either thinking or living 
<BR>
as ''higher''.  I'm not sanguine about which of the two (living or thinking) 
<BR>
should be labelled as ''higher'' than the other.  Probably the two are when 
<BR>
you look closely rather entangled and inseparable, anyway ?  What exactly *is* 
<BR>
''thinking'', after all ?  
<BR>
<P>It might even be true that before a human starts 'thinking' about things, he 
<BR>
has first to have dumbly tried out things (without too much of thinking 
<BR>
first), or have seen things happen ?  In that way, ''acting optimistically'' 
<BR>
could maybe come before (and be possible somewhat independently of) ''thinking 
<BR>
optimistically''.  *Some* people who hardly ever seem to think in their lives 
<BR>
(and who never heard of philosophy) do, I think, exhibit a marvellously D.O. 
<BR>
kind of living -- they just go do things without thinking too much about 
<BR>
possible bad outcomes.  That kind of D.O. living / D.O. action is possible 
<BR>
without thinking deeply. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 3.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, that's justificationalism. Science is about (see above)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticizing ideas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Point (2) should be: &quot;Do not believe anything that has been falsified.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that's an unnecessarily pessimistic view :-)&lt;grin&gt;:-).  I think that a 
<BR>
''proof'' *can* be constructive.  I mean, I think that a proof can 
<BR>
legitimately consist of showing that something *can* be done -- instead of 
<BR>
always showing only that something is 'falsified'.  I even think that it is 
<BR>
not very well possible to advance into new areas without this kind of
<BR>
positive proof.  
<BR>
<P>Only *dis*proving things (finding out how a theory could be false)
<BR>
does, I think, not generate enough ''trust'' in a theory to go build on
<BR>
top of it or advance from it (using the theory as a secure base) in other
<BR>
ways.
<BR>
<P>Is a failure to find something that disproves a theory A enough support
<BR>
to start believing in theory A ?  I think not.  I think that before stepping 
<BR>
on to the ice and trusting in the theory that the ice is thick enough to 
<BR>
support you, one primarily wants positive proof.  Seeing no one on the ice and 
<BR>
seeing neither people sinking through it nor people standing on the ice 
<BR>
without sinking through it does not convince *me* that the ice is thick enough 
<BR>
to unhesitatingly jump on to the ice.  I first would want to do some simple 
<BR>
tests, e.g. throwing some heavy stones on it or sitting on the shore and 
<BR>
pounding it with my foot.  Only after I see a positive proof that makes it 
<BR>
probable that the ice is in fact thick enough, do I want to jump onto it 
<BR>
without further hesitation. 
<BR>
<P>I think we *need* this kind of ''justificationalism'', that we cannot do 
<BR>
without it. 
<BR>
<P>In what way do *you* get to new positive theories with using as your tools 
<BR>
only disproving things; and *without* ever using positive, supportive proof ? 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Ciao,
</EM><BR>
<P>Best greetings,   Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Dynamic%20Optimism%20as%20a%20tool%20in%20logical%20reasoning&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000113162404.574A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
