Found a paper at <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat/0002075">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat/0002075</A> (abstract
<BR>
below) about a possible future literal singularity in human population
<BR>
and economy.
<BR>
<P>The authors have done curve fitting to the population and some
<BR>
economic indexes, and conclude that both have singularities around the
<BR>
same time, 2058+-5. Of course, this is a good example of the dangers
<BR>
of curve-fitting, since given the equations they are using they are
<BR>
bound to get a singularity *somewhere* and they only use population
<BR>
data from *before* the slowing down of birth rates. They also do some
<BR>
even less convincing arguing about log-periodic oscilliations near
<BR>
this singularity. In short, I doubt this sees publication in any good
<BR>
journal.
<BR>
<P>What I consider interesting isn't the conclusions, they are not
<BR>
exactly new, but the final sentence of the abstract: &quot;With a
<BR>
world-wide concern about the sustainability of this accelerated growth
<BR>
beginning to bud as well as the very recent slowing down of the
<BR>
population growth rate, this transition will hopefully be smoothen
<BR>
out&quot;. This suggests a worrying memetic possibility, namely fears of a
<BR>
singularitarity as a harbinger of total ecological and economic
<BR>
disaster. If you believe this, then it makes a lot of sense to do
<BR>
everything you can to smooth it out or cut the feedback loops. We tend
<BR>
to see the Singularity as something good, exciting or unavoidable, but
<BR>
with this view it is yet another horrible threat that must be
<BR>
prevented and whose proponents are obviously evil and misguided.
<BR>
<P>Personally I'm not that worried. I'm more of a swell than a spike
<BR>
person and I seriously doubt the use of curve fitting and analogies
<BR>
with simple physical systems with unchanging rules accurately
<BR>
describes long-range development in civilisations. I also think that
<BR>
the above potential negative meme can be defused if we apply enough
<BR>
intellectual rigor when describing our future scenarios,

<P>Authors: Anders Johansen (UCLA), Didier Sornette (CNRS/Univ. Nice;UCLA)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the world economy and human population have grown at a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tremendous pace during the last two centuries, raising
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increasing worries about the sustainability of this growth as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well as concerns that we humans as a result might cause severe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and irreversible damage to eco-systems, global weather systems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc \cite{Cohenscience}. At the other extreme, the optimists
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expect that the innovative spirit of mankind will solve the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems associated with a continuing increase in the growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate \cite{vonFoerster}.  Specifically, they believe that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world economic development will continue as a successive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfolding of revolutions, e.g., the Internet, bio-technological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and other yet unknown innovations, replacing the prior
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agricultural, industrial and information
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revolutions. Irrespective of interpretation, the important
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point is the presence of an {\it acceleration} in the {\it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate} of growth. Here, we show that both the acceleration in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the growth of the worlds human population until the 1970's as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well as in a proxy for capitalistic expansion in the United
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States since its creation as a nation until present are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent with a spontaneous singularity at the {\it same}
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;critical time $2058 \pm 5$ AD and with the same characteristic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-similar geometric patterns (defined below as log-periodic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oscillations). As a consequence, even the optimistic point of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view has to be revised, since the acceleration of the growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate contains endogenously its own limit in the shape of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finite-time singularity to be interpreted as an abrupt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition to a qualitatively new behavior. With a world-wide
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concern about the sustainability of this accelerated growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning to bud as well as the very recent slowing down of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population growth rate, this transition will hopefully be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoothen out
<BR>
