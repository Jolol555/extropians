There are a lot of skeptics about Cryonics, even amongst extropians.
<BR>
I for one don't subscribe. I am more than a &quot;bit&quot; negative. I think it's not
<BR>
feasible. Actually, I am not being negative. I am being true to my self. To
<BR>
reason as I see it.  For a lot of reasons i think it's not going to work, at
<BR>
least not how we are freezing corpsicles today. Not to mention my concern
<BR>
about the organizations themselves lasting as long as the Dead Dwellers'
<BR>
Dewers.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>There are some signed-up cryonicists right now who would totally agree with
<BR>
you on the real feasiblility of cryonics as it is presently done!  But
<BR>
advances have been made by 21st Century Medicine that when implemented (that
<BR>
may take several years) will greatly reduce brain structure fracturing.
<BR>
<P>So get signed up for cryonics as soon as possible because you have at least
<BR>
some chance with a cryonics policy and none without it, in the event of
<BR>
sudden death.  And everyone should WITHOUT EXCUSE be signed up for a
<BR>
decently sized life insurance policy so they will not wind up where they
<BR>
want a cryonics policy but due to age or sudden chronic illness they cannot
<BR>
afford one.
<BR>
<P>Saul Kent, the co-owner of the Life Extension Foundation and a  very
<BR>
successful businessman, will be moving forward in the near future to raise
<BR>
capital for two of his ventures, 21st Century Medicine and also LifeSpan
<BR>
Genetics (which is building upon new techniques for measuring the aging
<BR>
process, using gene chips).
<BR>
<P>He also is going to have a fundraising initiative soon to seek donations for
<BR>
improved brain cryopreservation.  The work will be directed by Doctor Greg
<BR>
Fahy.  This will go beyond the already impressive advances which his people,
<BR>
lead by Doctor Fahy, have discovered.  And this is where we all come into
<BR>
the picture by putting our money where our mouth is.

Still I have considered (though as yet decided against) signing up, just to
<BR>
fund researching reanimation. Better, if I was richer, I'd fund research for
<BR>
a cure for aging and death itself. Even better, get a personal trainer and
<BR>
get my heart in the best shape it could be.. damn, anyone want to buy some
<BR>
extropic art?  Anyway...
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>You can make donations to help fund cryonics research without signing up.  I
<BR>
will make everyone aware when Saul Kent starts his fundraising for improved
<BR>
brain cryopreservation.
<BR>
<P>I have also fantasized about how I would fund all my favorite organizations
<BR>
and projects if I were only a billionaire!! :)  By the time I was done the
<BR>
Extropian Institute, Prometheus Project, Foresight Institute, 21st Century
<BR>
Medicine, Cryocare, Alcor, ACS, CI and Eliezer's Singularity Institute would
<BR>
all be extremely well-funded.

The important thing is: superlongevity and the hope of finding a cure for
<BR>
death is getting airplay.  Nano is getting airplay. Natasha and Max are
<BR>
being interviewed. Ralph is being interviewed.
<BR>
The sad thing is that these same dumb networks who display all kinds of
<BR>
healthy skepticism for techno tend to promote (without a shred of evidence)
<BR>
all kinds of Uri Geller, afterlife,  X files claptrap      ..ostensibly to
<BR>
get ratings.... damn!: D- -Queen Evilfoof
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Extropian themes are getting an incredible amount of exposure now with the
<BR>
millennial fever going on and the realization that the world is progressing
<BR>
so fast.  I am glad Max, Natasha and others are being seen and heard in the
<BR>
mass media.  I am amazed and so happy that nano is getting the funding and
<BR>
respect (same thing?) it deserves.  I still remember a &quot;Scientific American&quot;
<BR>
article that shredded my newborn faith in nano which came after reading a
<BR>
Robert Frieta's article in a science fiction magazine.
<BR>
<P>Television programming is about getting ratings, no doubt.  But as public
<BR>
interest shifts this will cause the mass media to focus even more on
<BR>
transhumanist themes.  But I must admit I enjoy the X-files.
<BR>
<P>I still am amazed how being a transhumanist does not automatically mean that
<BR>
one is a cryonicist.  I realize the techniques must be improved but with
<BR>
proper financial backing they will get there.  Already, the 21st Century
<BR>
Medicine breakthroughs will make cryonics infinitely more likely to get us
<BR>
to the future we dream about.
