<EM>&gt; That said, I'm surprised that I can't find any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaction to Bill Joy's feature article in the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wired magazine. I can't find it on-line yet, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper version has hit the racks. It's the cover story,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
</EM><BR>
<P>The article was mentioned over the weekend, but I think most of
<BR>
us haven't had a chance to read it (yet).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Much of what Joy says parallels what Drexler said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about &quot;engines of destruction&quot;. However, many on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list will disagree with much of the article, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Joy's attitude towards the end of humanity is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is something that can and should be prevented.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a distinction here between the end of &quot;humanity as we know it&quot;,
<BR>
meaning people biologically and mentally similar to humans throughout
<BR>
history, vs the end of any intelligences which bear a resemblance
<BR>
to humans.  Extropians would not support a world which turns into a
<BR>
mindless grey goo or which kills off all human life via a biotech mistake.
<BR>
<P>It's not clear from your description whether Joy insists that humans
<BR>
not only stay around, but that they remain unchanged.
<BR>
<P>I think this is one of the main areas where list members might disagree
<BR>
with the general public, in that we accept the fact that humanity
<BR>
may undergo considerable change over the next century, including the
<BR>
possibility of becoming altogether nonbiological.  Many people would say
<BR>
that such an outcome is no better than having the human race wiped out
<BR>
altogether.
<BR>
<P>Some extropians, like Moravec, go even further.  He would say that it's
<BR>
OK if no present day humans survive, if the human race is in effect
<BR>
wiped out or at least superceded by robots and AIs of our creation.
<BR>
These are, in his words, our Mind Children, and for them to succeed us
<BR>
is no more tragic than for our biological children to do so.
<BR>
<P>Most people would not say that we should fight tooth and nail against
<BR>
our children to prevent them from shoving us off the earth prematurely.
<BR>
Yet they will say exactly that with regard to our mind children.
<BR>
This sounds to me like mindless genetic programming talking, and needs
<BR>
to be better justified if we are going to seriously oppose AI because
<BR>
of its potentially superior survival abilities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He goes far; after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outlining the central role he has played in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information revolution (for one thing, he invented the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unix editor vi)
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose it would be a cheap shot to make fun of vi here.  After all,
<BR>
I'm composing this message using it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Joy's attitude towards the end of humanity is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, I believe, will be shared by an overwhelming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of humanity when the issues become more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widely-known. A powerful majority.
</EM><BR>
<P>I will certainly look for the article.  But I do think the distinction
<BR>
above is important and can serve as a point of entry to get people
<BR>
thinking beyond their knee jerk survival instincts.
