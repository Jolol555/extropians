<BR>
|
<BR>
|&gt; Is there good reason to be arrogant on the net and not in person, when you
<BR>
|&gt; are ashamed of that behavior?
<BR>
<P>Personally, I believe that people show their ``true self'' more on-line than
<BR>
off-line, as they experience less social control on-line.  The socially
<BR>
``nice'' person off-line experience lots of social control from the humans
<BR>
it encounters and thus will show more of its ``real self'' than off-line.
<BR>
<P>|Heres a different spin: the reason is because... *we dont really have a
<BR>
|choice!*   We really *cant* be exactly the same in the flesh as we are
<BR>
|online, because of deep seated social programming since the time we
<BR>
|were zero to *be nice* and pleasant.  Thats just what we do.  It
<BR>
|would be damn hard to overpower those instincts, and furthermore,
<BR>
|its a good thing.
<BR>
<P>Instincts?  Can't?  Huh/Eh?  Interesting hypothesis.  Specify proof, if any.
<BR>
<P>|Consider: suppose Queene, you and I met at one of Natasha's lovely
<BR>
|gatherings and I acted or said some goofy thing like what I sometimes
<BR>
|write online, something that *if you read online* in the safety of your own
<BR>
|home, you wouldnt think anything about.  Suppose I said, &quot;Hey, that
<BR>
|Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Id like to finger her wattle.&quot;   You, sitting
<BR>
|there now, safe and alone, might just laugh or say &quot;Silly person.&quot;  If
<BR>
|we were face to face and I said that, you might be thinking &quot;Uh oh,
<BR>
|if he comes another step closer, Ill kick for the groin, scream and run
<BR>
|for that exit...&quot;
<BR>
<P>In my experience, the reaction to any verbal comment depends much on the
<BR>
non-verbal communication accompanying it.
<BR>
<P>I therefore presume your BtVS routine would less provoke a groin-killing
<BR>
reaction if you accompanied it with non-verbal communication ``I am harmless,
<BR>
don't kill me, please!''.
<BR>
<P>[Assumption: ``wattle'' does not refer to a Acacia subspecies. !-]
<BR>
<P>|My point:  online behaviour should be *allowed* and *expected* to be
<BR>
|a bit wackier, more open, more expressive, more free of the societal
<BR>
|taboos we have all been carefully programmed to observe.  It isnt just
<BR>
|freedom to be arrogant: one is freer online to lavish inappropriate
<BR>
|complements and blatant flattery.  Its all part of the fun of it.  We
<BR>
|cannot and should not even *try* to match in the flesh our online
<BR>
|personalities.  spike
<BR>
<P>Allowed: yes.  Expected: no.
<BR>
<P>Some sentient network life forms know the truth ``Internet does not forget.''
<BR>
and avoid unnecessary information leakage to the Net on their internal data.
