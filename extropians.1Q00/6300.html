This is PERFECT. It explains those high energy 'protons' that have been seen to
<BR>
impact the upper atmosphere, they weren't protons at all, but black holes. This
<BR>
also gives us the seeds to create wormholes and cost effective nuclear fusion.....
<BR>
Star Trek, here we come!!!!!
<BR>
<P>Now, all we need are hand held black hole detectors....
<BR>
<P>This also explains the reason I've gained weight in the last couple years... ;)

<EM>&gt; Holes in one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Despite their fearsome reputation, not all black holes are cosmos-gobbling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monsters, says Marcus Chown. There could even be one inside you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CAUGHT in a high-tech trap, a lone atom is blinking. From the spectrum of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light it looks like a cadmium atom. But to the scientists who have trapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, there's something not quite right: the frequency is shifted by a puzzling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0·002 per cent. Their unease gives way to astonishment as they discover that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their captive is a billion billion times heavier than an ordinary atom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Staring them in the face is a freak of nature--for in place of a nucleus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this atom has a gaping hole. A black hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>snip...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so, the Universe could be awash with charged primordial black holes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about a Planck mass, or 0·00001 grams. They would have an incredibly tiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radius of 10-35 metres. And in the aeons they have been drifting through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gas of interstellar space, they would have gathered about them a cloud of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons to neutralise their positive charge. &quot;The electrons would orbit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just like in a normal atom,&quot; says Flambaum.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Super-atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If such a beast were to run into the Earth, it could get trapped on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface and become lodged in a rock, in a laboratory bench, or even in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; head. What would this super-atom be like?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At first glance, there appears to be no limit to the number of orbiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons a black hole atom can have--it should depend merely on the charge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the black hole. It is easy to imagine atoms with a thousand electrons, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a million. But it turns out that there are limits: a fundamental one, and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical one set by the age of the Universe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fundamental limit was discovered by the British physicist Paul Dirac. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knew that in a normal atom, an electron is prevented from spiralling into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nucleus by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Electrons are attracted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive charge on the nucleus, but any electron trying to orbit too close to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the nucleus would be stuck in a very confined space. According to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uncertainty principle that means it would have to move very fast, too fast to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be trapped there by the electrical attraction of the nucleus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if the nucleus has a very large charge, the increased pull would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to overwhelm the uncertainty principle. &quot;Dirac found that for an atom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with more than 137 electrons there are no stable electron orbits,&quot; says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Flambaum. &quot;All electrons spiral down to nuclear oblivion.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So any charged black holes that formed in the big bang could not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collected more than 137 electrons. Any surplus would have been swallowed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hole almost instantly, cancelling out part of its positive electrical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But that's not the only constraint. Any hole that started out with a charge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as high as 137 would be less charged by now, because it turns out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons don't have to spiral in to be gobbled up. An electron isn't a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discrete little ball: its existence is actually smeared out. This means that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a small part of the existence is always within the black hole's horizon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which translates into a small probability that the electron will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swallowed. This probability increases with the cube of the charge on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hole. So highly charged black hole atoms quickly polish off their inner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons. According to Flambaum, the most complex black hole atoms that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could expect to see in today's Universe would have 70 electrons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corresponding to the element ytterbium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If experimenters were to trap a black hole atom in their lab, what would it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look like? The wavelength of light emitted by a normal atom depends on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy levels that its electrons can occupy. These are affected slightly by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the motion of the nucleus: a nucleus moves a little as a result of the pull
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of an electron orbiting it, just as the Sun wobbles slightly under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence of the Earth's gravity. The effect in an ordinary atom is to shift
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wavelength by a tiny amount from what it would be if the nucleus were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immovable--that is, if its mass were infinite. &quot;But a Planck mass black hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is effectively an infinite mass,&quot; says Flambaum. &quot;So you wouldn't get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shift you get for a normal atom. Such a difference would be easy to see with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern instruments.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A more dramatic effect would occur if an inner electron was gobbled. Then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black hole atom would do a quick change. A cadmium black hole atom with 48
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons would spontaneously turn into a silver black hole atom with 47
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons. And as the hole's mass depends on its charge, such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transformation would produce a huge burst of radiation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what are the odds of detecting a black hole atom, either in space or on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Earth? It really depends on how many of them are kicking around the Universe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We can get a rough idea of the maximum possible number by postulating that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Universe's invisible &quot;dark matter&quot; is made entirely of black hole atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;At best we could hope for one black hole atom for every 1000 trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trillion hydrogen atoms,&quot; says Flambaum. &quot;That would make them about 30 times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rarer than uranium atoms.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So there is no doubt that black hole atoms would be rare creatures, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Flambaum's point is that they might not be impossibly rare. He suggests that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best bet could be to look for their anomalous spectral lines in gas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around the Sun. The real problem in detecting one would be in spotting its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light amid the blaze of light from countless normal atoms. Flambaum admits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this would be quite a challenge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exotic entities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Atoms with a positively-charged black hole in their hearts may seem weird.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But Flambaum and Berengut have imagined some even more exotic entities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formed when a minimum-mass black hole has a negative charge. &quot;Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gathering electrons about it as it travelled through space, it could gather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protons or even nuclei,&quot; says Flambaum. Such a &quot;protonic&quot; atom would be about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2000 times smaller than a normal atom--so small that short-range nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forces would come into play. Two protons in orbit around a hole would react
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to form a deuterium nucleus. Such a reaction, which is the first step in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process of making sunlight, takes about 10 billion years to happen in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun. However, it would happen much faster around a black hole, where the two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protons are close enough for nuclear forces to snap them together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The arrival of a third proton would trigger the nuclear reaction to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helium-3, and the process carry on to build ever heavier nuclei around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black hole. Flambaum and Berengut point out that the nuclei would be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from normal nuclei, which have to contain large numbers of neutrons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to glue them together because of the tremendous electrical repulsion between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protons. But around a black hole, the protons would be squeezed together by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hole's gravity. &quot;Consequently, you would expect nuclei far richer in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protons than normal nuclei,&quot; says Flambaum. This type of black hole atom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could act as a catalyst for building new elements in stars. The energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; released in the reaction could make a nucleus fly off, allowing new protons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be captured.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another, weirder possibility, arises because a proton is a very large object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared with a point-like black hole. From the point of view of the hole, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proton is not a single object but an assembly of three quarks. &quot;This means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is the possibility of the proton actually losing one of its quarks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the black hole,&quot; says Flambaum. The black hole would then possess colour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charge, a property thought to be the preserve of quarks alone. In effect it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would become a superheavy quark, and from a distance the whole system of two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quarks orbiting a quark black hole would appear to be a superheavy proton. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we could cap- ture these weird particles they would make a great test bed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theories of how quarks interact with each other. The snag is that they'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very hard to catch. They are so small that they would fall between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ordinary atoms of a solid and so could never be trapped on the Earth's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But most significantly, black hole atoms might provide a window onto the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early Universe, all the way back to the first instant, within 10-43 seconds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the beginning. This is far earlier than any other relics, such as photons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or neutrinos. According to Bernard Carr of Queen Mary and Westfield College
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in London, primordial black holes would tell us how lumpy the early Universe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was. They might even preserve a memory of a time when the fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constants of nature were different from their values today. For example, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some cosmological models the strength of gravity varies in the very early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Universe. Relic black holes might record this variation in the values of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their mass.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So although Flambaum admits that black hole atoms of all types would be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to detect, the rewards could be great. &quot;Looking for them has got to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be worth a try,&quot; he says. Just don't expect to see black hole paperweights in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the shops any time soon.
