<EM>&gt; The problem is that it is so easy to counterfeit information, while it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes a much greater investment to counterfeit material goods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Especially in an age where integrity, honesty, honor, and loyalty all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have lost their meanings, I would prefer the rule of law in such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations rather than giving in to the barbarians. I would be John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Galt, rather than to aid others without recompense.
</EM><BR>
<P>John Galt didn't seek a government-granted monopoly on his engine;
<BR>
he locked it in a room and sold the power it generated like a good
<BR>
capitalist, no patents needed.  Too bad he didn't realize how much
<BR>
more fabulously wealthy the gulch would have been (including him)
<BR>
if he had also allowed others to build the engines and find new
<BR>
applications for them and improve them.
