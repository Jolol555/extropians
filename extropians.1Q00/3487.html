<P><EM>&gt; Seems pretty obvious to me that you don't have to be very intelligent to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience emotion, laughter and fun.  Monkeys seem to experience all three,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not to mention human idiots.  Although creativity certainly takes some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree of intelligence, it could be argued that creativity is simply the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to solve a problem in a unique way.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whitehead says somewhere that laughing at an accepted theoretical
<BR>
statement is the first sign that something radically new is about to
<BR>
emerge. I doubt that any species other than our own &quot;laughs&quot; as we
<BR>
do -- this prompted Aristotle to toy with the definition of man as
<BR>
&quot;homo risibilis&quot;.  This presumes there is an actual difference between
<BR>
the simian, or canine, baring of teeth which resembles a grin, and
<BR>
that human response to cognitive dissonance called &quot;laughter&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Before problem-solving behavior occurs, in other words, there has to
<BR>
be a conceived problem, just as it is generally believed that the real
<BR>
intellectual feat is asking a new question, or reforming an old one, in
<BR>
such a way that it is answerable in one way or another.
<BR>
<P>Thus the adequate description of a problem or formulation of some
<BR>
valid question presupposes &quot;intelligence&quot;; both seem to require
<BR>
&quot;emotional&quot; motivation and &quot;ironical laughter at contradiction&quot;. And
<BR>
both imply novelty and innovation, hence &quot;creativity&quot;. So it does
<BR>
seem to me that problem-solving, a subset of which is question-
<BR>
answering, implies the integral application of these four processes.
