<P>
I posted this over a week ago as &quot;re: top ten list&quot; and it's gotten zero
<BR>
response. Perhaps that obscure subject heading was a problem, so let me try
<BR>
again. I'd like to here 'Yea' or 'Nay' on this, or even 'Mu':
<BR>
<P>There is a proposition that all creative processes have natural selection as
<BR>
an underlying mechanism: 1. Mutation or a random information source external
<BR>
to the system. 2. A progressive winnowing of the information for
<BR>
compatibility or usefulness. 3. Amplification and combination of the
<BR>
survivors to compete at a higher level. (I use 'natural selection' rather
<BR>
than 'Darwinian process' because Darwin's view excluded, unnecessarily I
<BR>
think, feedback from phenotype to genotype as the Lamarckian view allowed.)
<BR>
<P>This seems very compatible with a 'bottom up' view of mental organization,
<BR>
such as in Marvin Minsky's book 'Society of Mind' or very recently, in the
<BR>
article 'Swarm Smarts' in the March, 2000 issue of Scientific American. I
<BR>
first came across the idea in Gregory Bateson's book 'Mind and Nature'. One
<BR>
thing I remember from Bateson's book was a discussion of parthenogenesis:
<BR>
hatching a frog egg by pricking it with a pin. He said that this was
<BR>
necessary to break the symmetry of the egg-which side would the belly be
<BR>
on?. The system cannot generate this information internally (technically it
<BR>
would then not be 'information'). And creativity might be like that-whether
<BR>
genetic or mental: to avoid getting in a rut, there may need to be a
<BR>
continual inflow of new information, percolating from the bottom levels of
<BR>
organization upward.
<BR>
<P>I was thinking of this while reading Eliezer Yudkowsky's Singularity
<BR>
documents where he mentioned getting a 'creative spark' into his systems.
<BR>
Could this be the parameter that must be taken into consideration?
<BR>
<P>I've only been on the list for a few months and this is my first substantive
<BR>
post. I hope it generates some discussion.
<BR>
