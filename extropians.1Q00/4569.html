<P>No, you got me all wrong.  I think Linux is an improvement
<BR>
over Windows - I use Linux when I get the chance, and I've
<BR>
even recommended Linux to friends!  I just don't understand
<BR>
why it's a &quot;huge&quot; improvement.  Swapping Windows for Linux
<BR>
on 95% of the worlds PCs is Big Thing; there's an
<BR>
oppurtunity here for the industry to push an OS that really
<BR>
is a huge improvement.

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Both, they're interrelated.  To do anything useful with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the UI requires changes to the architecture.  And vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They aren't interrelated at all (well, perhaps they are in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the case of Windows, and that's a major problem).  Unix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't require what is usually thought of as a UI at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all.  All I need is port 23 (telnet) or some more secure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternative and I can do 100% of what I need to do day to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day on a Unix box, including running any graphical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications remotely.
</EM><BR>
<P>The user interface isn't just graphics, at the very least
<BR>
changing the user interface in any significant way means
<BR>
changing the file system (i.e. the way the user can interact
<BR>
with 'objects' and other data, how they interact with each
<BR>
other, etc; this can be done on a command line or a GUI or
<BR>
whatever, it really doesn't matter).
