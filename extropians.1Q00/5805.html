<EM>&gt; &gt;I have read many of the posts on this thread and I'm mind boggled.  I mean,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if we are really talking about having some money to do something courageous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with — what do you want to do? Live or die?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I call it a war on death.  The best defense is a cultural offense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah sure spreading longevity propaganda is a good idea.  But I think you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a hard time getting John &amp; Jane Public to get on board until we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate (or at least substantially reduce) world poverty and hunger.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean the obvious response is: &quot;What?!?  There are *millions* of starving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in the world who don't have access to decent medical care, potable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water or residential and communication infrastructures and you want us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work on giving them indefinite life spans?  Are you mad?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I had $100 million to donate I think it would go toward biotech research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; geared toward increasing world food production and social programs geared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toward more equitable and efficient food distribution and medical care.  I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also like to see more aggressive efforts to bring computers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communication infrastructures to more of the developing world.  Once you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a relatively prosperous and informed world population, the longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit will be a much easier sell.
</EM><BR>
<P>1. This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical care and
<BR>
longevity can both be financed.
<BR>
<P>2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
<BR>
- to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
<BR>
practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
<BR>
<P>3. Longevity research may well advance &quot;normal&quot; medical care in ways
<BR>
that purely investing in &quot;normal&quot; medical care would never accomplish.
<BR>
For example, if one were to find a generic vaccine that made humans
<BR>
immune to most or all viruses, that would have immediate applications
<BR>
toward preventing people from getting sick - but such is much more
<BR>
likely to be discovered by researchers looking to minimize health
<BR>
problems over infinite lives, as opposed to researchers looking to just
<BR>
let people live long enough to die at 60 or 70.
<BR>
<P>4. For the past several centuries, there have been some in the world who
<BR>
have lived better than the others.  One way to introduce immortality for
<BR>
everyone would be to introduce it for the rich first, then as time goes
<BR>
on - and the technology becomes more familiar and (one hopes)
<BR>
simpler/less expensive - introduce it to everyone else.  (&quot;Poverty&quot;
<BR>
these days is not quite as hard a life as &quot;poverty&quot; was 100 years ago,
<BR>
at least in almost any industrialized country, due in part to this
<BR>
practice.)
