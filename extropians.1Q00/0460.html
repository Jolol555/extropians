<EM>&gt; &gt; Speaking of which, where is Mike Lorrey?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Like many other formerly active list members, he is quite busy with work
<BR>
and various projects.  Like I should be :^)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; He seems to have dropped out of the Extropians List and formed his own &quot;ExI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Freedom&quot; group for Extropians to discuss &quot;guns, other weapons and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; borderline-legal technologies, their legal aspects and technical info and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implications.&quot;  See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/group/exi-freedom/?fetchForward=1&start=1">http://www.egroups.com/group/exi-freedom/?fetchForward=1&start=1</A>&gt;.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yep.  Not a very active list, as most of the traffic is between myself and
<BR>
Michael Lorrey.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; They seemed to have been busy stockpiling guns, getting manufacturer's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permits to make their own guns, and fighting paperwork to purchase machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns in preparation for Y2K.  Just before Y2K there was (literal?,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figurative?) talk about living in a cave for a few months.  After Y2K they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are discussing which state is going to secede from the Union first.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Not an entirely accurate characterization, seeing as how this is being
<BR>
applied to me.  As one of the two people who are active on the list:
<BR>
<P>Stockpiling guns:  Talking about guns doesn't imply stockpiling.  I own
<BR>
significantly fewer as of Y2K than a year prior.  Certainly not buying
<BR>
machine guns for Y2K (machine gun collecting is just that; for
<BR>
collections).  Most gun enthusiasts know that machine guns have a very
<BR>
limited tactical value that is not applicable to most self-defense
<BR>
scenarios.  Most people buy them because they are fun to shoot, contrary
<BR>
to the perception of the non-shooting public.
<BR>
<P>Manufacturing guns:  Yep, there was some discussion of using advanced
<BR>
materials in next generation firearm design.  It is a fascinating
<BR>
engineering topic for some people.
<BR>
<P>Cave:  It was a figure of speech, with reference to the fact that people
<BR>
had dropped off the lists for several months.  I certainly have never
<BR>
lived in a cave; far from it (I live on a hill top).
<BR>
<P>Secession:  A popular topic with people in some parts of this country. 
<BR>
While it may not be common or relevant where you live, it is a familiar
<BR>
topic in the Sagebrush states.
<BR>
<P>The exi-freedom list was not a Y2K list, which you seem to imply.  There
<BR>
actually *are* exi lists that were about Y2K, but this isn't it.
