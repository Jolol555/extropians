<EM>&gt; is only 5 to 10 yrs off.

<P>Coward, won't name names will ya....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Im pretty sure it is longer than that, 20-30 for instance, before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have the tech to theoretically extend life out to 150 yrs.
</EM><BR>
<P>It only matters to someone 120+ now, whether or not we will have the
<BR>
technology to hit 150 in 20-30 years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question please: is there a term for the point in history where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension technology is increasing our life expectancy one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year for each year one lives, such that the mathematical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expectation of ones remaining life stops decreasing?
</EM><BR>
<P>The forever and ever era (TFEE).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That point I suspect is 20-30 yrs away.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, you can't put a specific date on it due to the fact that
<BR>
aging rates vary with age.  Aging appears to be an exponential
<BR>
function with an exponent of 5-6.  You can figure it out by
<BR>
looking at the age-specific incidence of heart attacks, cancers,
<BR>
strokes, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wait, now I further realize that this point may have already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been achieved for those who are under 10 yrs now, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension techniques will likely be less effective for those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already aged.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep. I'd bet its been reached for most people under 30.  Its those
<BR>
of us in our 40's who are on the edge while those in their 50's
<BR>
and up have to look at cryonics or accelerating the singularity onset.
<BR>
<P>You have to keep in mind that 10 years ago, they were predicting
<BR>
we wouldn't have the human genome until 5 years from now.  According
<BR>
to NCBI, as of Feb 25, 2K, 16.7% of the genome is finished and in
<BR>
the database and another 47.4% of it is in draft form.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This has surely already been hashed out, I just missed it somehow.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, Spike, you are thinking about the unthinkable from the perspective
<BR>
that most people have.
<BR>
<P>One of the astronomers from New Zealand, stopped by as I was checking
<BR>
out of the hotel and commented that it must be difficult for me (given
<BR>
how unwilling the astronomers are to consider a &quot;living&quot; universe).
<BR>
I made some comment that it was worth studying in any case since
<BR>
the ideas are likely to be where we are going.  I realize in thinking
<BR>
about this, that as change accelerates and more and more &quot;cherished
<BR>
notions&quot; get turned upside down, its going to be really hard on most
<BR>
people.
