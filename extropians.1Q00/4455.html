My wife and I and couple of our friends signed up for
<BR>
paypal recently.  We've found it to be pretty cool and
<BR>
fun because we all own Palm Vx's and Paypal has an app
<BR>
you can download to your Palm.  This app allows you to
<BR>
&quot;beam&quot; money to your friends and associates.  When we
<BR>
go out to eat, one of us pays the bill and the others
<BR>
simply beam the payer what they owe.  It sounds
<BR>
horribly geeky, and it is!  But it's fun.  
<BR>
<P>My wife is always bitching because there aren't any
<BR>
businesses (real world anyway) which allow you to pay
<BR>
with you Paypal via Palm.  Wouldn't it be nice to just
<BR>
walk up to a IR terminal and click a couple buttons on
<BR>
your Palm, aim and pay for your merchandise?  Once
<BR>
everyone carries similar handhelds (palm held?), I'm
<BR>
sure we'll see something like that.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, paypal is painless and lots of fun when ya
<BR>
wanna get your Geek On.

<P>HUMANITY FIRST!  We are capable of creating a technological/biological/neurological utopia in the next century.  We already have the capability of destroying all life.  What does it say of us as a species if we don't choose the former?
