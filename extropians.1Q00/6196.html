<P><EM>&gt; Spike I'm also enjoying Brin's book.  But he seems to waffle over whether he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinks complete transparency is a good idea, which makes me think that maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am a little bit too extremist in my own views.  Oh well, wasn't there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thread around here lately about value of extremists?  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly!  Anyone who has read my comments on openness and
<BR>
infonudism over the past year knows Ive waffled more than Bill
<BR>
Clinton regarding whether a transparent society is good or bad.
<BR>
There will be winners and losers.  One big loser I can think of
<BR>
is the local porno shop owner, just struggling to make a decent
<BR>
living like the rest of us, will lose the patronage of the local
<BR>
ministerial trade, not to mention most of the deacons, choir, etc.
<BR>
Thats just one example, but abuses are easy to imagine.  My
<BR>
earlier comments on the MikeTracker and the sphexcam are
<BR>
two others.
<BR>
<P>Im with you, Zero, in that the tranparent society will probably
<BR>
make it much harder on would-be despots, but we could lose
<BR>
some freedoms to do ordinary legal naughtiness which we
<BR>
might not want our spouses or coworkers to know about.
<BR>
It isnt as simple as admitting to everyone all our bad habits.
<BR>
Brin is right to point out that the transparent society is a mixed
<BR>
blessing/curse.
<BR>
<P>Did anyone catch tonights episode of West Wing?   It was
<BR>
on exactly this very timely topic.  spike
