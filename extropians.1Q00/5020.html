<P><EM>&gt; Ok, I've kept silent long enough. CAVEAT, Brian the following is not directed at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you. I believe you only relayed information so I'm not criticizing you or your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion, I don't even know them. The comments below are for everyone.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is soo wrong. There are a number of reasons one can get dishonorably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discharged from the military that have nothing to do with whether you are good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough for gun ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Warning upcoming rant below:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am truly surprised at all the rhetoric here. Let me explain. I gathered from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the Objectivist leanings here that personal liberty would be high on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lists list. Now I consider myself a moderate liberal but in some ways I would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more Libertarian than those of you claiming to be. Let me explain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No one, no government, no man, no woman, no not even a deity has the right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me I cannot protect myself or my loved ones in like kind to what ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatens me or my own. If those threatening me or my own happen to have guns or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knives or baseball bats or whatever, then I have the right to have the same or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better to protect my life and that of my loved ones. Who gave me that right? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DID! How's that for personal liberty?!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quote statistics and theory till you are blue in the face, it means nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What does mean something, no what means EVERYTHING is MY life and the lives of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those I love. I mean get real people. We are supposed to be Life Extensionists!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How extended will your life be if some low life, that has no respect for his/her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own life much less yours, decides to forcefully take something from you and caps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you so you cannot identify or for simply the thrill? It happens, it's not just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hollywood cliché.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course I want something done to keep guns out of the criminals and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TRULY &quot;ineligibles&quot; hands. However, let's get real again. What good is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unloaded gun when the creep breaking your door down was at least clever enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to load his/hers before getting anywhere near you? Absolutely none, might as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well not have it to begin with. Ever hear of the Darwin awards? That's what I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give anyone that actually did put their bullets out of reach when it really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One last thing. In an ideal world there would be no guns. Actually that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivial. In an ideal world their would be no NEED of guns or anything else for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self defense. We don't live in that world yet. Remove all the guns and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturers somehow magically today and by tomorrow there'd be millions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them owned by guess who? That's right every miscreant, every lowlife, every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psycho with even half a brain would have a home made, yes crude but effective,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; garage model and be knocking your door down because you likely will not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stooped as low.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, done ranting. No need to plonk. I've said all I will say. I won't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respond to whatever objections you all may find against my logic. I believe if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you reduce it to what's really important, your own and your loved ones precious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and maybe even immortal lives--if we here have our fondest wishes come true, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then just use your imagination--dare to picture the worst actually happening to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you yes even to you and yours, then you will have to agree that NO ONE has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to FORCE you to be vulnerable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Not even armed lowlifes - which is why I want them disarmed.
