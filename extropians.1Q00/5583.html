<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:                        March 21, 2000 
<BR>
<P>JPL AWARDS CONTRACTS FOR PLANET-HUNTING MISSION STUDIES
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative sparks are flying as four contract-winning teams 
<BR>
begin the quest to design Terrestrial Planet Finder,  an 
<BR>
ambitious mission in NASA's Origins Program that will look for 
<BR>
possible life-supporting planets around other stars.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a three-month competitive process, the Jet 
<BR>
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., selected the industrial-
<BR>
academic teams, which will spend the next two years developing 
<BR>
mission concepts for Terrestrial Planet Finder.  The teams are 
<BR>
led by Ball Aerospace of Boulder, Colo.; Lockheed Martin Space 
<BR>
Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif.; TRW of Redondo Beach, Calif.; and 
<BR>
SVS, Inc. of Albuquerque, N.M.  About 75 scientists from 30 
<BR>
universities and research institutions, 16 industrial firms, and 
<BR>
two NASA centers are represented on the teams.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've succeeded in our goal of engaging some of the best 
<BR>
minds in the world,&quot; said Dr. Firouz Naderi, Origins Program 
<BR>
Manager and Terrestrial Planet Finder project manager at JPL.  
<BR>
&quot;Now their task is to cover the waterfront on all feasible 
<BR>
mission concepts for the Terrestrial Planet Finder, bringing us 
<BR>
one step closer to finding out whether life exists elsewhere in 
<BR>
the universe.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding habitable, Earth-like planets doesn't come easy. 
<BR>
&quot;The challenge is like trying to locate a firefly next to the 
<BR>
beam of a brilliant searchlight,&quot;   said Terrestrial Planet 
<BR>
Finder Project Scientist Dr. Charles A. Beichman of JPL. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution depends on developing a whole suite of 
<BR>
challenging technologies, including those necessary to fly 
<BR>
several 3.5 meter (137-inch) telescopes in a formation so precise 
<BR>
that we will know their positions to a fraction of a centimeter, 
<BR>
even though the space between them will span a few football 
<BR>
fields.  The mission's success will also depend on the ability to 
<BR>
cancel out a star's glare so that a planet one million-times 
<BR>
fainter can be seen, and will require instruments so sensitive 
<BR>
that they can identify the presence of life-sustaining chemicals 
<BR>
on a planet up to 50 light years away from Earth.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We will be looking for warm, water-bearing planets like 
<BR>
Earth, and even for signs of primitive life,&quot; said Beichman.  &quot;To 
<BR>
get there, Terrestrial Planet Finder will be built on the 
<BR>
technological shoulders of earlier Origins missions, but several 
<BR>
leaps in innovation will still be required.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why the team at JPL decided to establish an 
<BR>
innovative approach to mission design and planning.  To avoid 
<BR>
basing Planet Finder's design on current and potentially 
<BR>
&quot;conventional&quot; thinking, JPL threw open the doors to invention by 
<BR>
requesting proposals that would reflect the most diverse set of 
<BR>
feasible and affordable mission architectures.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We didn't want the design teams to be constrained by 
<BR>
existing concepts or so-called 'right answers,'&quot; said Naderi.  
<BR>
&quot;This way we'll have the broadest set of concepts to choose from 
<BR>
and won't miss out on any opportunity that's too good to pass 
<BR>
up.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first, eight-month phase of the study, the four 
<BR>
contract teams will be busy brainstorming options for detecting 
<BR>
and characterizing far-away planets.  In December 2000, the best 
<BR>
two architectures from each team will be selected for further 
<BR>
study in the planned, 11-month Phase 2 study, ending in November 
<BR>
2001. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrestrial Planet Finder is planned to launch in 2012.  
<BR>
Over a five-year period, it will take a look at 250 stars to 
<BR>
determine which ones may have orbiting, life-sustaining planets.  
<BR>
The mission will also advance our understanding of how planets 
<BR>
and their parent stars form by making thousands of images, all 
<BR>
with a sharpness 10 to 100 times better than those of the Hubble 
<BR>
Space Telescope.  More information about Terrestrial Planet 
<BR>
Finder  can be found at:  <A HREF="http://tpf.jpl.nasa.gov">http://tpf.jpl.nasa.gov</A> .
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Origins Program seeks to understand our cosmic roots by 
<BR>
detailing how galaxies, stars, planets, and the chemicals 
<BR>
necessary for life formed and developed in the universe.  Its 
<BR>
other primary goal is to search for the presence of life on 
<BR>
distant worlds, answering the question &quot;Are we alone?&quot;  Details 
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL manages both Terrestrial Planet Finder and the Origins 
<BR>
Program on behalf of NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, 
<BR>
D.C.  JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology 
<BR>
in Pasadena.
