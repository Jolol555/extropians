<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property. I'm having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fun with those bozos right now on alt.anarchy. They don't understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that I've painted them into a paradox. They either have to acknowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; property rights or admit that they beleive that individuals are slaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the group.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea that anti-patent arguments are anti-property has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debunked here so many times that using it is dishonest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I have pointed out here before, it is the patent concept that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a socialist one--it derives from the labor theory of value--the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discredited idea that work is valuable in itself.  Just because an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventor does work, that's no reason to assume it is valuable, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than a craftsman making artifacts no one wants.  Value is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created by demand; if an inventor creates something to meet the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demands of the market, he will make money.  If others also fulfill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demands by using his invention, they make money too.  None of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justifies the inventor using state guns to prevent others from also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profiting from his invention.  The state should protect your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property, because when others use it, you can't.  The state has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business protecting your ideas.  If others can use them to profit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than you do, it is because they fulfill needs better than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and deserve to profit more--after all, you have more intimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge of your ideas than they do--if you can't profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, you're doing something wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that it is so easy to counterfeit information, while it
<BR>
takes a much greater investment to counterfeit material goods.
<BR>
Especially in an age where integrity, honesty, honor, and loyalty all
<BR>
have lost their meanings, I would prefer the rule of law in such
<BR>
situations rather than giving in to the barbarians. I would be John
<BR>
Galt, rather than to aid others without recompense.
