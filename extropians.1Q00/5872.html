Obviously, we can solve the alleged population problem and life extension
<BR>
research funding problem by using humans and some form of fusion as power
<BR>
generators, by sticking them in pods full of pink goo with lots of grody
<BR>
looking cables hanging off them. As long as we give this task to the big
<BR>
battery companies, the life extension problem will become a race to increase
<BR>
working battery life.

(That damned matix movie... it's what you get if you start with the premise
<BR>
&quot;What if the Energizer Bunny became sentient and decided to enslave
<BR>
humanity?&quot;)
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt;&gt;Don't get me wrong.  I wish there was a bunch more research being done on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;nano, cryo and immortality.  But the only way to get funding for such
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;research is to convince people that there money is better spent there than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on
</EM><BR>
like
<BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;people we already share this planet with.
