<EM>&gt; &quot;dynamic optimism&quot; -- I like that.

<EM>&gt; With that kind of energy we can make a paradise on (or off) Earth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And it might not require unlimited technological achievement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It might just require moving beyond superstition and tyranny.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean, once we get past superstition and tyranny, we may discover that we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need technology as much as we used to believe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would that be ok with you?

<P>A resounding NO! I have an uncle who is widely traveled. We discuss this natural
<BR>
vs technology issue all the time. He once told me that after spending time with
<BR>
the Bedouin sheep herders, that he began to feel they knew much more about the
<BR>
Earth and how it worked than we with all our technology. He is a biologist and
<BR>
some of you would label him a greenie. You might label me the same with the
<BR>
exception I feel we can save the environment with MORE tech not less.
<BR>
<P>I told my Uncle, the Bedouin would never understand the beauty of Universe
<BR>
beyond what he could see with the naked eye. He would never appreciate the
<BR>
wonder of the nature of atomic particles or marvel at solving the puzzles that
<BR>
only asking high tech questions can lead to. My uncle marveled at the peaceful
<BR>
serene uncomplicated pastoral life of the Bedouin.
<BR>
<P>I told him that IF there was truth to the god myth and the afterlife, that maybe
<BR>
then the pastoral life would be enough. Generation after generation doing the
<BR>
same thing as our parents did. Never pushing the envelop. Why try after all our
<BR>
reward is in heaven? Generation after generation living only for deaths alleged
<BR>
rewards. Wrong! Mankind could never be satisfied not asking the question &quot;WHY&quot;.
<BR>
The answer inevitably leads to progress. Progress takes technology.
<BR>
<P>Would we be satisfied if we were immortal and had nothing to do but tend gardens
<BR>
for eternity? (substitute your idea of a techless existence) Not I! This was
<BR>
always my problem with the religious paradigm of my folks. Eternity tending
<BR>
gardens on bended knee worshipping there deity, no worries, no woes, need
<BR>
something just wish it into existence! I want problems to solve! If eternity
<BR>
were too easy I would be bored to insanity! I would beg for oblivion!
