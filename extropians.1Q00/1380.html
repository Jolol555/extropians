</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Political axis might be?  EvMick
</EM><BR>
<P>EvMick, I want us to keep in mind the actual purpose of making
<BR>
these diagrams, or any theory for that matter: to make predictions.
<BR>
We went over almost this exact discussion about a year ago, until
<BR>
it was drowned out by a g*n thread I think.  I might comb over
<BR>
the archives to see if we have contributed anything new.
<BR>
<P>What I had in mind to start with was making a map that would
<BR>
predict where a person's thoughts might end up should they
<BR>
continue a rational line of thought from where they currently
<BR>
stand.  One can see why a fundamentalist Judeo-Christian
<BR>
believer is similar to a staunch atheist: the FJC holds the opinion
<BR>
for instance, that the bible is the word of god, must be literally
<BR>
true, etc.  When such a person is convinced, against their will
<BR>
or otherwise, that even one precept in those writings is simply
<BR>
not true, then all of it becomes untrustworthy, and atheism is
<BR>
a logical philosophical next door neighbor.
<BR>
<P>Keeping that in mind, what is the upwing equivalent of the
<BR>
religious thoughtspace axis, and does such a theory have
<BR>
any predictive value?  Im thinking some of Rowen's terms
<BR>
(positivist, humanist, etc) belong on an orthogonal axis.  spike
