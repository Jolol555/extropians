<P>
r bradbury replying to natasha vita more:
<BR>
&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;A very nice distillation of jumbled memes that I required many more words 
<BR>
for. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>Robert, well -- to be honest, that's what I like about your posts, I do that 
<BR>
too... If you mean making too many points and jumbling a lot of 'forming' 
<BR>
ideas ... the fact that you will admit this makes me respect you more.
<BR>
<P>Too often on the list - when the topic of creative ideas and 'art' come up, 
<BR>
it's done in such a derisive, indulgent way, though often a subject the 
<BR>
poster is embarrassingly unversed in.
<BR>
<P>Myself - and perhaps I can speak for Natasha here - find it tiresome to argue 
<BR>
fine points with people who are clearly not well educated about the *current 
<BR>
state* of the arts. There is a lot of misinformation about the arts dating 
<BR>
back to antiquities, and people need to read up on the subject before they 
<BR>
post, which they would eagerly do if they wanted to post about biotech or 
<BR>
nano. 
<BR>
<P>Many do their research, ESPECIALLY because: the arts and technological media 
<BR>
are very crucial to the futurist movement - as important as the sciences 
<BR>
which support them!! (Imagine uploading into a virtual world without the work 
<BR>
of visionary artists, ace animators, graphical interface experts, fractal 
<BR>
painters, avitarians, 3D modelers, architects or sound engineers...)
<BR>
<P>Yet people still think of art in this really cheesy, dumb, old world, icky 
<BR>
way!! DOH!!!
<BR>
<P>The technologically aware artists find ourselves in the position of debunking 
<BR>
mythical, archaic concepts about art, not unlike how the skeptics must take 
<BR>
on superstition and claims of Spoon Benders.
<BR>
: )
<BR>
So you must excuse me for being curt, for I have a lot of fully formed 
<BR>
opinions about the creative process. It is my bread-and-butter. My job. 
<BR>
I liked our conversation, it was like being at a social event or dinner when 
<BR>
ideas can be enjoyably tossed around without that &quot;debate&quot; &quot;Win&quot; edge that 
<BR>
the list forum provokes all too often.
<BR>
Cheers,
<BR>
Nadia
