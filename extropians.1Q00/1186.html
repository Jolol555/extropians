Terry Donaghe says:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Part of Bill Clinton's new technology &quot;initiative:&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - $475 million for a nanotechnology initiative. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could lead, the White House official said, ``to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to store the contents of the Library of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Congress in a device the size of a sugar cube.'' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (from a Yahoo! News story)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that not the lamest damned definition of nano
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you've ever seen?  More proof that government is
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>It's only proof that they're out of date.  They are just borrowing the
<BR>
idea from Feynman's famous &quot;There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot;
<BR>
talk.  You can find it at: <A HREF="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html">http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Here's the relevant section:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simpler way might be this (though I am not sure it would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work): We take light and, through an optical microscope running
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backwards, we focus it onto a very small photoelectric screen. Then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electrons come away from the screen where the light is shining. These
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electrons are focused down in size by the electron microscope lenses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to impinge directly upon the surface of the metal. Will such a beam
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etch away the metal if it is run long enough? I don't know. ...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the Encyclopaedia Brittanica on the head of a pin, but let's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider all the books in the world. The Library of Congress has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximately 9 million volumes; the British Museum Library has 5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million volumes; there are also 5 million volumes in the National
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library in France. Undoubtedly there are duplications, so let us say
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there are some 24 million volumes of interest in the world.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would happen if I print all this down at the scale we have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussing? How much space would it take? It would take, of course,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the area of about a million pinheads because, instead of there being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just the 24 volumes of the Encyclopaedia, there are 24 million
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volumes. The million pinheads can be put in a square of a thousand
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pins on a side, or an area of about 3 square yards. That is to say,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the silica replica with the paper-thin backing of plastic, with which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have made the copies, with all this information, is on an area of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximately the size of 35 pages of the Encyclopaedia. That is about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half as many pages as there are in this magazine. All of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information which all of mankind has every recorded in books can be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carried around in a pamphlet in your hand---and not written in code,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a simple reproduction of the original pictures, engravings, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else on a small scale without loss of resolution.  ... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose that, instead of trying to reproduce the pictures and all the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information directly in its present form, we write only the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information content in a code of dots and dashes, or something like
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, to represent the various letters. Each letter represents six or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven ``bits'' of information; that is, you need only about six or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven dots or dashes for each letter. Now, instead of writing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything, as I did before, on the surface of the head of a pin, I am
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going to use the interior of the material as well.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us represent a dot by a small spot of one metal, the next dash, by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an adjacent spot of another metal, and so on. Suppose, to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conservative, that a bit of information is going to require a little
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cube of atoms 5 times 5 times 5---that is 125 atoms. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have estimated how many letters there are in the Encyclopaedia, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have assumed that each of my 24 million books is as big as an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encyclopaedia volume, and have calculated, then, how many bits of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information there are (10^15). For each bit I allow 100 atoms. And it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turns out that all of the information that man has carefully
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accumulated in all the books in the world can be written in this form
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a cube of material one two-hundredth of an inch wide--- which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the barest piece of dust that can be made out by the human eye. So
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is plenty of room at the bottom! Don't tell me about microfilm!
