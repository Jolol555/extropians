Vacuum dirigibles don't work as much better than hydrogen or helium
<BR>
ones as you would think.  The lift of a balloon is proportional to the
<BR>
difference in the molecular weight of the internal gas vs air.  Air is
<BR>
mostly N2 which has a molecular weight of 28.  Helium has a molecular
<BR>
weight of 4 and H2 weighs 2.
<BR>
<P>This means that the lift from a helium balloon would be proportional
<BR>
to 28-4=24, the lift from a hydrogen balloon would be proportional
<BR>
to 28-2=26, and the lift from a vacuum ballon would be proportional
<BR>
to 28-0=28.  So in going from helium to vacuum you only gain about 15%
<BR>
more performance, not a huge improvement for normal use.
<BR>
<P>And of course the problem is that the total force on the outside of a
<BR>
vacuum balloon would be enormous.  Sea level air pressure is about one
<BR>
ton per square foot.  Considering the hundreds of thousands of square
<BR>
feet in the balloon of a large dirigible, the total force is tremendous.
<BR>
So you need a very strong material to withstand that, which will tend to
<BR>
be heavy.  And the energy release from a catastrophic implosion failure
<BR>
would be far too dangerous, so you'll need internal compartments, making
<BR>
the balloon even heavier.
<BR>
<P>Overall it doesn't seem like a very practical substitute for hydrogen
<BR>
and helium.
