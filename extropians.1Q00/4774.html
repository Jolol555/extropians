<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Ooh%20a%20gun%20fight!!%20(Was%20Re:%20near%20anything%20boxes%20allowed...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000313235931.35282.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mike@datamann.com</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What database?  Where can I see it for myself.  If as you say, it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;undeniable&quot; then I won't deny it.  I doubt however that there is any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;proven&quot; and &quot;undeniable&quot; evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;FBI Database of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not even remotely close to &quot;undeniable.&quot;  Sure everyone knows that crime has 
<BR>
been steadily decreasing recently.  *Nothing* I have ever seen attributes 
<BR>
this trend to the large number of guns circulating in society.  You might 
<BR>
want to check out what the National Center for Policy Analysis has to say on 
<BR>
this count.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I can also retort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;against criminals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As to the need for such cartoons, suit yourself.  As for the words you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be trying to put in my mouth, I never said, or suggested, any such 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You quite vehemently supported the same for the opposition. If you don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one way, don't support the other..
</EM><BR>
<P>You misinterpreted my comment.  What I said was &quot;As to the need for such 
<BR>
cartoons, suit yourself.&quot;  What this means is, if you want to publish 
<BR>
cartoons lampooning my opinions and people like me who hold them, suit 
<BR>
yourself.  In other words, go for it, have at it, cartoon away...I don't 
<BR>
care.  Comprendo?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Do you really want to continue?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Only if you can turn down the posturing and the rhetoric and turn up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; facts and a *reasonable* debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I didn't start it, you did. I'm all for reasonable debate. Just the facts.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, just the facts, huh?  Lets start with your claim that the FBI Database 
<BR>
of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995, somehow supports your assertion that 
<BR>
&quot;guns are what keeps (sic) as many people in this country in circulation as 
<BR>
possible.&quot;  And that this assertion is, in your own words, &quot;Proven fact, 
<BR>
undeniable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Where *exactly* can any such &quot;facts&quot; be gleaned from the FBI Database of 
<BR>
Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995?  Reference to web page would be appreciated.
<BR>
