<EM>&gt; Joe Dees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The phenomenology of perception (wherein all perception is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intending of its perceptual object), was built upon the foundations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laid by not only Franz Brentano (PSYCHOLOGY FROM AN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EMPIRICAL STANDPOINT, SENSORY AND NOETIC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CONSCIOUSNESS), but by his more famous student Edmund
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Husserl ... - (Dees: how we constitute perceptual objects)
</EM><BR>
<P>You discuss this below -- my short answer, by anchoring a
<BR>
reversible succession of percepts in the category &quot;substance&quot;;
<BR>
Kant answers Hume with respect to a &quot;necessary&quot; succession
<BR>
by means of the a priori relation &quot;causality&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [Dees] Let me try to mediate between the two.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given that the visual field organizes phenomena, and precisely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomena in focus, it is nevertheless necessary to learn to focus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our lenses, to co-ordinate the two lines of sight, to correlate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focusing with binocularity (which are not innately linked, for we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; separate them), and to synthesize vision with our other perceptual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modes.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's interesting, Joe, that it seems best simply to accept an equivoca-
<BR>
tion in our term &quot;intentionality&quot; -- [1] consciousness is always OF some-
<BR>
thing, and [2] attention is vectored; that is, we &quot;intend&quot; to be aware
<BR>
of what we are aware of.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         Husserl's contributions, of course, are many.  The most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seminal of these, however, did not originate with Husserl himself,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but with his teacher, Franz Brentano.  These include the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characterization of perception as (1) intentional, and (2) pre-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reflectively self-aware (1874: 153-189).
</EM><BR>
<P>(2) is, for me, the sticking point.  I think this is so, but I've never
<BR>
been able to derive it.  What do you think, Joe?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  We may distinguish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between these two types of horizons by calling the first the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horizon and members of the second type field horizons.  The world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horizon contains all field horizons, and is reflectively approachable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not apprehensible in its totality.
</EM><BR>
<P>The notion of a &quot;cognitive horizon&quot; is very, very subtle.  Both Jaspers
<BR>
and Heidigger struggled with it.  There is the idea that between the
<BR>
figure and the ground there is a discontinuity -- an emptiness, that
<BR>
is a horizon that points toward the &quot;transrational&quot; meaning of the
<BR>
immediate configuration. This is readily apparent in optical illusions
<BR>
of the alternating figure-ground type. When the ordinary perceptual
<BR>
background suddenly presents itself as, pari passu, a foreground, one
<BR>
is tempted to compare this with an event horizon which cannot radiate
<BR>
an image of its contents.  In any event, a perceptual field always
<BR>
seems contained, and not merely by the geometry of the lens and
<BR>
retina, a metaperceptual context which, could we only perceive it,
<BR>
would totally interpret what we are looking at.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to comment on your entire outstanding post, but the rules
<BR>
require self-restraint.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
