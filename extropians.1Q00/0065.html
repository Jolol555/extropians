<EM>&gt; &gt; Colleagues,

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I wish to give notice here that I must dissociate myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and my organization from any effort to politicize our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Transhumanist Movement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This, I just don't get.  What do you mean, &quot;politicize&quot;?  You think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanists shouldn't meddle in politics?  I agree that we shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meddle unnecessarily, or meddle in things that don't need to be handled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by *us in particular* - Clemmensen's Law, don't y'know.  But politics is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inextricably interwoven into life as we know it *and* the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurology.  Even if you live in a box, you're a power counter for those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who claim to help the homeless.  I don't understand what you mean by not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting to be &quot;politicized&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dear Eliezer,
<BR>
<P>I understand &quot;Transhumanism&quot; to be a philosophy of life and neither a
<BR>
social nor political ideology.  It does not seem possible to me for us to
<BR>
deduce or infer principles of government or public administration from
<BR>
the axioms of our philosophy.  Therefore any position taken by members
<BR>
with respect to social problems such as crime, underemployment and
<BR>
unemployment, and illiteracy, or to political issues such as taxation,
<BR>
public assistance, or business regulation would necessarily be the
<BR>
expression of personal preference and as such internally divisive if
<BR>
presented as the &quot;politically correct&quot; stance of those who consider
<BR>
themselves transhumanists.
<BR>
<P>Of course, each of us acts in one way or another as a political agent--
<BR>
but as a citizen, not an Extropian. Since our organization is international,
<BR>
the alternative is a descent into provincialism and disunity.
<BR>
