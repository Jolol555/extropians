<P>
But, this has been going on for a LONG time.  Just as the good German 
<BR>
doctors didn't start out to wipe out the Jews - they were just trying to do 
<BR>
the &quot;right thing&quot; (euthanasia) by their poor, hopeless, (assumed to be) 
<BR>
genetically predetermined mental patients.  But then the definition of 
<BR>
mentally defective got widened and the NAZIs broadened it further to include 
<BR>
the entire gene pool of the Jews, Gypsys, etc.
<BR>
<P>So, try writing a modern day Lolita...  I was once thinking about going down 
<BR>
to TJ, where there is allegedly a prostitutes union - Los Magdelenes, 
<BR>
semi-sponsored by the U.N. human rights commision  - and advising them on 
<BR>
how to set up a website.  Right now, the prostitutes in TJ, largely 15-18 
<BR>
year old kids from the villages who find that there's no other work 
<BR>
available, are subject to all kinds of dangers and abuses by the corrupt 
<BR>
system.  Plus, they spend most of their waking and working hours standing 
<BR>
uselessly on the sidewalk, by the hundreds, hoping that someone will pay 
<BR>
them $10 or $20 for fifteen minutes of actual work.  It would be relatively 
<BR>
easy to set up worldwide liassons on the web, and eventually upgrade the 
<BR>
working conditions, improve the pay, reduce the risks, etc., possibly moving 
<BR>
to something like the Italian Bordello system.
<BR>
<P>So...  A former cop advised me on what I was getting into.  Just for 
<BR>
attempting to contact the union to give them free advise would likely net me 
<BR>
years in prison once I got back accross the border - if the Mexican mafia 
<BR>
didn't kill me beforehand.  (Just as the typical naive American who buys 
<BR>
drugs in TJ is immediately turned in to the border authorities by the seller 
<BR>
- for a kickback.)
<BR>
<P>There are a lot of categories of speech that are already outlawed as prima 
<BR>
facia parts of a criminal conspiracy - as what I was considering - never 
<BR>
mind that prostitution is not criminal in Mexico - hate to mention this, but 
<BR>
if you do something in a foreign country that it legal there, but illegal in 
<BR>
the U.S., or in your home state, you can be prosecuted when you get back, as 
<BR>
in the U.S. companies that payed the expected foreign backsheesh and then 
<BR>
got prosecuted.  Now the authorities are going after guys who have sex with 
<BR>
under-aged girls in Guatemala, etc., never mind that what is &quot;under-aged&quot; 
<BR>
varies wildly from state to state in the U.S.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the camel already has put his nose in for some time.  You know the 
<BR>
rest.  If you want to stop it, then you have to deal with the &quot;BUT WHAT 
<BR>
ABOUT THE CHILDREN!&quot; idiots.

<EM>&gt;speech - EEK!

<EM>&gt;Date: Tue, 01 Feb 2000 12:37:29 -0500
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's one:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;How to smoke marijuana:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1: acquire or make smoking utensil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2: acquire or grow marijuana
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3: put that in your pipe and smoke it&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's another one:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Put seed in ground.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Grow plant to make paper on which Constitution is written.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The no-speech provision of that bill is preposterous.  I doubt even the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clueless representative could claim that it does not violate the First
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Amendment to the Constitution, and none could rightly do so.  To claim that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussed bill provision (not necessarily the rest of the bill) does not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;violate the First Amendment is blatantly unconstitutional; the Constitution 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is American, ergo, supporters of this bill provision are un-American.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Viewed broadly, this bill provision outlaws chemistry class and all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chemistry teachers, by extension, math, physical science, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is specific judicial precedent that it is unconstitutional to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legislate the &quot;intent&quot; of free speech.
