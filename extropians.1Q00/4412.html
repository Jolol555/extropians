<EM>&gt;As I see it, this dilemma is important. It is maybe one of the most

<P>Yes, it's the most important problem I think anyone has identified here.

<EM>&gt;debate about issues and applying the technology for protection (such

<P>If the Singularity produces an SI, then of course we'll have to go along with

its prescriptions, Big Brother or not. Occasionally it occurs to me that the
