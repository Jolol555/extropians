<EM>&gt;   Our government (US) is trying to wipe all out all privacy on the net, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barely anyone is rasing an eyebrow.  AOL has even jumped in to say they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will help the federal police in any way to assure such a Big Brother 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance system becomes a reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has got to be the most draconian proposal yet in the history of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net, and no one appears to be getting upset. What gives?  Why is it I seem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the only one very chilled by this prospect?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think most people view these proposals as so outlandish that they are
<BR>
unlikely to go anywhere.  If the government actually tried to implement
<BR>
them then there would be a big fight, I'm sure.
<BR>
<P>This report was prepared by law enforcement as a list of the &quot;challenges&quot;
<BR>
they face due to new technology.  And no doubt they're right, online
<BR>
anonymity will make their jobs more difficult in some cases.  There was
<BR>
no input from civil liberties people, or net advocates at all.  It was
<BR>
just law enforcement creating their wish list.
<BR>
<P>The FBI has been pushing to restrict crypto for years, and they've never
<BR>
gotten anywhere on it.  In fact the restrictions have progressively been
<BR>
softened.  We're almost at the point today where crypto is completely
<BR>
unrestricted as far as the U.S. is concerned.  Neither the Democrats or
<BR>
the Republicans have supported them on this issue.
<BR>
<P>The same thing is likely to happen with anonymity.  The report was
<BR>
greeted with jeers from the Republican side of the aisle, and there's no
<BR>
way that Clinton/Gore is going to run with it either, it's exactly the
<BR>
opposite of their ideological bias.  (When these kinds of issues arise,
<BR>
it's nice to have a Democratic administration, so the &quot;loyal opposition&quot;
<BR>
is the side fighting the law enforcement proposals, while the Demo support
<BR>
is lukewarm at best.)
<BR>
<P>And then consider the many technical obstacles which would arise in any
<BR>
attempt to even define, let alone restrict, anonymity.  Running remailers
<BR>
is a voluntary effort.  Essentially it's a matter of receiving a message
<BR>
and resending it while not keeping records.  Will they say that every
<BR>
person is required by law to keep records on any piece of information they
<BR>
receive, if they retransmit that information in some form?  There's no
<BR>
way they could get people to accept that kind of Draconian, Big Brother
<BR>
legislation.
<BR>
<P>In short, the FBI may wish the world was such that they could keep
<BR>
tabs on everything everyone does.  This report expresses that wish.
<BR>
But it isn't going to happen.
