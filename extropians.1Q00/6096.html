<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;How would economic equality be brought about and maintained?  (I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;advocating this -- only trying to see how Zero will answer this.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure why you're asking this question or what it has to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thread.  But since you asked, here goes:  First off, I never called for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; immediate &quot;economic equality.&quot;  But if you want my guess as to how it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eventually come about, I think that once we all have access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nano-enabled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; near-anything boxes, you will ipso facto have substantial &quot;economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; equality&quot; since anybody will be able to make near-anything at almost no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then we don't need that equality to be enforced by law?  Nanotech will only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bring about equality of certain stuff.  Information will still not be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It mgiht be easier to get and use, but even a slight advantage in it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result in one person having better stuff than another.  I'm willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;living with that, provided the other person is not out to kill or control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, nanotech will only bring about &quot;certain stuff.&quot;  Certain stuff like a 
<BR>
healthy, immortal body, your own little version of paradise in orbit 
<BR>
somewhere in the solar system and virtually *everything* else you could 
<BR>
possibly want or imagine.  Sheesh.  Some people are *never* satisfied.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The way I see it transparency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; helps to further this goal, not to inhibit it, particularly where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transparency if two-way and power equivolent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And I do not.  Imagine this.  You live in a society where most people find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gays repulsive and quite a few are willing to kill gays.  The majority,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let's say, doesn't care about gays dying per se, especially if they see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain gays having lots of mind blowing anal sex many times a week or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;night.
</EM><BR>
<P>Come on.  Get real.  It is illegal to murder people, regardless of whether 
<BR>
they are gay or how much &quot;mind blowing anal sex&quot; they enjoy.  And the fact 
<BR>
of the matter is that those laws are enforced.  Sure there was a time when 
<BR>
if you were black in America you had no rights which any white man was bound 
<BR>
to honor.  Those days are passed.
<BR>
<P>I never said transparency will necessarily bring about an end to all illegal 
<BR>
behavior.  What it will do is *guarantee* that the perpetrator is 
<BR>
identified, caught and convicted.  That's about all any social policy can 
<BR>
hope to do.  To cure people of criminal tendencies you need to look to the 
<BR>
neuroscientists, and maybe the philosophers.
