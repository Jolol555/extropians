<P><EM>&gt; You have to realize that *most* people in government, research, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are *highly* conservative.  I suspect their mental mindsets do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  let them entertain paradigms that would grossly upset their world-view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Really now, do you think the government would actually fund a technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that would eliminate revenue sources for the government and perhaps the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  government itself (if all the people &quot;leave&quot;) if it knew that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the ultimate result?!?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A few people may be clued in but I have to believe most are pretty 
</EM><BR>
clueless.
<BR>
<P>These observations are consistent with my own.  Although the word &quot;visionary&quot; 
<BR>
gets bandied about from time to time by historians and even contemporary 
<BR>
political spin-doctors, the political process is pretty ruthless in weeding 
<BR>
out imagination.  In fact, the almost-universal career pattern for both 
<BR>
elected politicians and government bureaucrats selects very heavily for 
<BR>
conventional thinking.  Since success in these fields is almost entirely a 
<BR>
function of being allowed access to existing power structures by incumbents, 
<BR>
any sign of non-conformity is suppressed at a very early stage.   By the time 
<BR>
someone has achieved a position of real power and influence, they have 
<BR>
learned well the lesson that only small, incremental change is &quot;possible&quot;.  
<BR>
People who succeed in the political world over the span of a typical career 
<BR>
have almost always internalized the pattern of suspicion of innovation.
<BR>
<P>On top of this is the fact that the democratic process makes maintaining 
<BR>
power a full-time job.  People in positions of power in most institutions 
<BR>
don't have the time or energy to really study new ideas.  They depend on 
<BR>
summaries and sound-bite outlines for &quot;mastery&quot; of even the most complex 
<BR>
policy issues, with most of their personal resources being devoted to 
<BR>
constantly &quot;working the system&quot; to stay in power.
<BR>
<P>These factors make looking to the political process for leadership in the 
<BR>
transhumanist agenda essentially hopeless.  As a result, I've come to 
<BR>
conclude that successful strategies for truly rapid progress toward 
<BR>
transhumanist goals must look to means for cleverly side-stepping the current 
<BR>
power structure.
