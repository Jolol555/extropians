<EM> &gt; Given that the core is in the unthinking depths, and the elliptical orbit

<EM> &gt; of the On/Off star would have it out in the halo most of the time, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; probably from the Beyond.  Perhaps if the time of the collapse of the ultra
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tech on the Spider world could be accurately dated, Pham would have a clue
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that it was the *core* where things failed- and thus the wrong place to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; look.

<P>But TransPowers' gadgets work everywhere, even/especially in the
<BR>
core. (Interesting question, is the Countermeasure a thing made by
<BR>
Powers, or the TransPowers? The latter, apparently).
<BR>
<P>We don't know where OnOff is travelling, inward, or outward. If it's
<BR>
outwards, then rather the TransPowers' gadgets never ceased operating,
<BR>
or the Powers' gadgets have just started operating again, still
<BR>
erratically. (Which means the passage through the core didn't destroy
<BR>
them).
