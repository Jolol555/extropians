<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A word on effectiveness:  There are a few indications that are at least some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of these substances in high dosages are effective in improving long term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory in mammals.  However, the size of the effect seen here is small, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no evidence of impact on short term memory (which is more closely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correlated with problem solving and general intelligence).  Also note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the evidence on long term memory suggests that it is dosage of the drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during *encoding* of the memory that is most relevant (rather than during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *retrieval* of the memory).
</EM><BR>
<P>As the resident memory researcher, I would just like to add that the
<BR>
above seems to fit my knowledge of the field. 
<BR>
<P>A further problem is that many of the memory enhancer drugs likely act
<BR>
by increasing the plasticity of the hippocampus either directly or
<BR>
through various relevance-signals. This would imply that they also
<BR>
make forgetting faster, at least in intermediate memory. I have some
<BR>
new results that place constraints on this, but I have to wait until
<BR>
the paper is accepted before I start explaining more. (sorry)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What is more clear is that a large number of drugs classified as nootropics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are powerful neuroprotectants, likely to protect against ageing, anoxia, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognition-degrading drugs.  So from that perspective use may well be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justified.  I would set your expectations fairly low as far as immediate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious effects on your current cognitive powers, though.
</EM><BR>
<P>As a rule of thumb, the effects seem to be 10-20% better in most
<BR>
tests. To get a qualitative improvement, better encoding strategies
<BR>
(mnemonics, study techniques, attention control) are better.
