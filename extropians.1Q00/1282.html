<EM>&gt; &gt; What needs to be explained, in this view, is what would cause quint-

<EM>&gt; &gt; eventually a differentiation of labor in the development of multicellular

<P>Precisely.  Forming multicellular organisms changed the scale at
<BR>
which you could operate, therefore opening up new ecological niches.
<BR>
Consider the race to &quot;get big&quot; in trees.  The higher you go, the
<BR>
more sun you get.  Now, the transition to complex cells was driven
<BR>
mostly likely by the difficulty of transfering large gene complexes
<BR>
of naked DNA between bacteria.  Better for one bacteria to &quot;get big&quot;
<BR>
and engulf another one in its entirety (leading to mitochondria
<BR>
and chloroplasts).  The problem is that once you are &quot;big&quot; you
<BR>
have to develop better partitioning systems or active transport
<BR>
to keep the diffusion of molecules in a very large space from
<BR>
slowing down your growth rate.  Even then the added complexity
<BR>
gives you headaches (bacteria replicate in an hour or less, eukaryotic
<BR>
cells take 18-24 hours).
<BR>
<P>I think calling all of this &quot;cooperation&quot; may be stretching it
<BR>
a little.  We would have to nit pick on the difference between
<BR>
cooperation and symbiosis.  Particularly when the symbiosis
<BR>
may be required for the survival of both &quot;organisms&quot;, while
<BR>
cooperation perhaps is not.
<BR>
<P>Generally, I would agree that the rise of social cooperation has
<BR>
some similarities (cooperation between people changes the scale at
<BR>
which you can &quot;operate&quot;, opening up new niches in which you can survive).
