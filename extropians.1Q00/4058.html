<EM>&gt; &gt; I think this is just wrong.  The difference between your beliefs now and at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the &quot;end&quot; of inquiry is made up of a bunch of little differences between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nearby points in time.  Anything that informs you about your beliefs at any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; future time implicitly informs you about your beliefs at the &quot;end&quot;.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prove this in a Bayesian framework if you would find that informative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Go ahead.  Right off the bat, I posit that you can't provide me with such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a proof at all if I'm going to have an infinite number of logically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;independent thoughts about ethics (as at an Omega point, if any).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Before you begin, however, take note of an interesting fact.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The probability that I'll change my beliefs in light of what your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computation tells me provides an upper limit on the certainty of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prediction; ...  So its computation will have to take into account
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the result of its own computation before yielding its answer.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But consider ANOTHER interesting fact.  ... But if I AM going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change my beliefs, ..., then the computation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't tell me anything with any certainty whatsoever.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand what you mean by your Omega point assumption. But how
<BR>
about we start with a simple example, and then see where it needs to be more
<BR>
complicated, eh?  Let's assume that in every possible state of the universe
<BR>
you will eventually come to some &quot;end&quot; conclusion about ethics.  Let's pick
<BR>
a particular statement S about ethics, and say that you will in the end
<BR>
either agree with it or not. More specifically, let's break the universe of
<BR>
possible states in four disjoint subsets: A,B,C,D.  In sets A and B you will
<BR>
agree with S, and in sets C and D you will disagree with S. And at the
<BR>
moment your prior over (A,B,C,D) is (.1,.2,.3.,4). So your probability
<BR>
estimate for agreeing with S is 30%.
<BR>
<P>Now consider the factual question of whether human's ancestral tribes are
<BR>
more like bonobo or baboon tribes.  You realize that this matters for human
<BR>
ethics.  Bonobo is the answer in sets A and C, while baboons are the answer
<BR>
in states B and D.  Now if I just told you that the answer is bonobo, you
<BR>
would update to a 25% chance of agreeing with S, while if I told you baboon
<BR>
you would update to a 33% chance of agreeing with S.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully this has all been standard so far.  Now we do the think you seem
<BR>
to think is hard.  There are these same sets A,B,C,D with the same prior and
<BR>
the same relation to S, but we drop the bonobo/baboon interpretation of A,C
<BR>
vs. B,D.   Now A,C are the sets where I just tell you that you will now have
<BR>
a 25% chance of agreeing with S, while B,D are the sets where I tell you its
<BR>
a 33% chance.  Upon hearing this you update your beliefs to be consistent
<BR>
with the claim I just made.  Ta da, I have fully taken into account the
<BR>
effect of my statement on you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Let's consider a physics analogy.  [...] You want the mass of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particular atom you have in mind, and no you aren't going to tell me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which one that is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a totally faulty analogy.  Totally unlike this example, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question of what ethical beliefs I'm going to have is entirely well-posed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and completely verifiable after the fact.  (So long as we take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;functionalism to be right, and I do.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand your objection.  It seemed well-posed and verifiable
<BR>
to me.  I you want to be clearer about verifiability, assume that the
<BR>
identity of the atom was encoded in a light beam sent off to another
<BR>
star, and the signal would return in ten years.
