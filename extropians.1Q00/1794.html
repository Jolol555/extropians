<P><EM>&gt; Hello Emlyn,
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi Bob,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You see, it isn't really necessary to implement a social policy of bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memecide; just don't interfere with their self-destruction. If you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progress, you need winners.  Losers are merely collateral damage. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a question of reveling in this -- one soberly accepts it as an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unavoidable cost of doing business. I do question whether it ought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be deductible.
</EM><BR>
<P>The basic problem with the self-destruction of the losers is that the &quot;self&quot;
<BR>
part seems less than evident on inspection. One observes rather often that
<BR>
the destruction wrought apon an individual or organisation is not self
<BR>
inflicted, it is inflicted quite explicitly by another more powerful party.
<BR>
<P>Something else that I take issue with is that the &quot;Losers are merely
<BR>
collateral damage&quot;. We are not at war.  These losers are for the greatest
<BR>
part actual people, and losing can mean all kinds of suffering, up to and
<BR>
including death. There is no greater good which is served by the destruction
<BR>
of the weaker by the stronger, except perhaps that of the system itself; a
<BR>
measure by which, surely, and individualist could not stand.
<BR>
<P>Mentioned in the previous post (and I am not singling you out, Bob, this is
<BR>
a common thread continued by many extropes) was the idea of removing poor
<BR>
genes from the gene pool. In the context of modern society, the idea of
<BR>
improving the human gene pool by evolutionary methods, as a worthy goal, is
<BR>
just silly. Genes just aren't that important any more, and are certainly not
<BR>
worth killing anyone for, even passively by letting someone die. The economy
<BR>
of ideas and technology (the stuff we can do) must be predominant. The
<BR>
evolutionary method is a cool way to build an organism, a cool way to write
<BR>
software and do research, and a really very uncool, innefficient, and
<BR>
unnecessarily painful way to conduct an advanced society of intelligent
<BR>
beings.
<BR>
<P>I don't deny the power of dynamic self-organisation, and I don't see top
<BR>
down organisation as a desirable primary method of running society (although
<BR>
I do think there is a strong role for government, including the &quot;w&quot; word).
<BR>
We do well to remember however, that, to the &quot;losers&quot;, the inefficient,
<BR>
uncompetitive life they lead is, to them, the most valuable thing there is.
<BR>
When that life is compromised, even taken, where is individualism?
<BR>
<P>Our dynamic organisation methods can still be humanitarian, and don't
<BR>
require &quot;collateral damage&quot; in order to proceed. It's a wartime metaphor,
<BR>
and innapropriate in times of peace.
<BR>
