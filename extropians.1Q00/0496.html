<P>
Friends,
<BR>
<P>The subject line should more rightly be phrased &quot;the economics of
<BR>
transition to advanced automation tech&quot;.  Humans want stuff.
<BR>
Notwithstanding the extropian woody for molecular precision, to the tired,
<BR>
huddled masses it is generally a non-issue.  The exception being medical
<BR>
technology, where, because living cells are so small, molecular-scale
<BR>
miniaturization is crucial to achieve functionality.  Having gotten that
<BR>
off my chest let's move on to economics.
<BR>
<P>Costs, profits, investments, stock, assets, competition, competitive
<BR>
advantage, productivity, labor, capital, short-term gains, long-term gains,
<BR>
technological evolution.  Like that there.
<BR>
<P>Within the current socio-economic context--which is the context of the
<BR>
question--if someone demonstrates a lower-cost means of producing
<BR>
something--orange juice, automobiles, waterfront property, combustible
<BR>
substances suitable for fuel, glow-in-the-dark sex toys--investors will
<BR>
appear, money in hand.  Their intent will be to close their eyes--visions
<BR>
of sugarplums dancing-- and then open them again, magically to witness
<BR>
their stack of green having manifested obedience to the biblical command to
<BR>
be fruitful and multiply.
<BR>
<P>So listen my children to the story of Santa Claws and the Execution of
<BR>
Nanoninja Capitalism.
<BR>
<P>Once upon a time, in the far away land of TrulyFreeEnterprise, some new
<BR>
companies came into being.  These were: Minit-Maid, makers of virgin-fresh
<BR>
sort-of-fruit juices, and other nutritional substances; CondoMaximum,
<BR>
makers of acreage-to-order (up to 70% of the earth's surface; off-planet:
<BR>
&quot;The Sky's the Limit&quot;); Generic Motors, makers of all manner of powered
<BR>
conveyances for use above, below, across, and through, land, sea, air, and
<BR>
interstellar space; UberStandard Earl, makers of go juice in bulk--liquids,
<BR>
gases, and uber-standard plasmas; and Joy to the World the Lord is Cum,
<BR>
makers of &quot;Satisfaction: GUARANTEED!&quot;
<BR>
<P>This consortium possessed a then-in-development-soon-to-be-perfected
<BR>
technology capable of producing all manner of stuff, in vast quantity, for
<BR>
next to nothing.  I'll spare you the technical details, but suffice it to
<BR>
say that production is accomplished by the use of robot-elves of all sizes
<BR>
whose capacity for production and reproduction shatters the self-esteem of
<BR>
rabbits and bacteria alike.
<BR>
<P>At the board of directors meeting the discussion of the business plan went
<BR>
something like this:
<BR>
<P>Poobah in charge of getting investment capital:  &quot;We'll need some cash, of
<BR>
course, to get rolling, but since our projections project total dominance
<BR>
of the world economy, everybody wants in.  So start-up capitol is no
<BR>
problem.  Favorable terms is a non-issue.  (Doing a cheesy Alphonso Bedoya
<BR>
accent) 'I don't got to cho you no steenking favorable terms!'  People are
<BR>
out there literally throwing money at us, begging us not to squash them
<BR>
like a bunch of bugs.  Sexual servitude and other forms of social
<BR>
sycophancy seem like viable options.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Poobah in charge of maintaining a sense of proportion:  &quot;Whoa there, babe!
<BR>
Keep your Johnson under control!  We're in this to make a buck.  Not to
<BR>
destroy the fabric of human life as we know it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Poobah of tutti poobahs:  &quot;Yes, gentlefolk, our picomasop is right.  We
<BR>
don't want to hurt anyone.  We want to be careful.  We want everyone to be
<BR>
happy.  Not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it does us
<BR>
no good to take over the galaxy if, in the process, we turn it into a
<BR>
stinking hellhole.  Now you all know me.  I'm no shy, deferential kind of
<BR>
guy.  I'm no softy.  When it comes to competitive ruthlessness, to
<BR>
mercilessly--yet with a certain joie de crim--grinding the life out of a
<BR>
would-be adversary, I don't hesitate.  That's why, down in the trenches,
<BR>
I'm affectionately known as &quot;Rapin N. Pillagin&quot;; I live for the thrill of
<BR>
uberDomination,...
<BR>
<P>(All the various Poobahs begin to chant)  &quot;Uber, uber, uber, uber,...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Potp:  &quot;Yes, yes, thank you.  But we're entering a new era.  We're
<BR>
transitioning into a new economic paradigm.  We're moving from an era of
<BR>
scarcity where wealth was strictly limited, and the silken robes of
<BR>
civility disguised the jungle-spawned-and-mean-street-honed bloodsport of
<BR>
tribal cannibalism--I've often pondered the mystical similarity between
<BR>
that word and our cultural holy word: Capitalism,...but I digress--and
<BR>
power was captured in the arena of competitive combat from whence only two
<BR>
outcomes were possible: to stand in glorious, exultant, uberVictory, or to
<BR>
be defeated and crushed, your shattered remains cast down, to be torn and
<BR>
profaned by the ravening mob.  Ah, what a time it was.
<BR>
<P>But that is all gone now,...well, mostly,.. and no time for weeping.
<BR>
Technology has brought us, inexorably, to an age of abundance, and we must
<BR>
make the best of it.  We have to be smart enough, and creative enough, and
<BR>
courageous enough to forge for ourselves a place in the new paradigm.  I
<BR>
for one will not settle for the fate of the dinosaurs, the oblivion of
<BR>
obsolescence.  This old raptor seeks a new rapture.  In an era of unrivaled
<BR>
abundance, the bar has been raised.  Soar with me then my fellow
<BR>
carnivores.  Set your sights on a new promised land.  Bear witness to the
<BR>
vastness of a new destiny.  For you will not, as I will not, settle for
<BR>
anything less than Total Galactic Domination.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Much hooting and hollering, stomping of feet,  shouts of &quot;uber, uber,
<BR>
uber,...&quot;, &quot;I want to have your baby!&quot; from both genders, undergarments
<BR>
flying through the air, wails of ecstasy, etc.)
<BR>
<P>Potp:  &quot;Thank you, thank you.
<BR>
<P>Now, here's the plan.  We'll develop productive capacity in all the major
<BR>
arenas of economic activity: food, energy, land, housing, transport, etc;
<BR>
prototyping and then perfecting our production systems.  We'll make all
<BR>
kinds of benevolent, sweet, and cooperative sounds early on so as to allay
<BR>
the fears that will, at the outset, naturally arise.  We will exercise
<BR>
deliberate restraint and give no sign of competitive ruthlessness,
<BR>
difficult as that may be for some of us.  We will look scared and strained.
<BR>
&nbsp;In a word, we'll look weak.  We'll charge full retail for our products and
<BR>
services, building a nice little war chest, while at the same time
<BR>
spreading rumors that the Santa Machine is buggy and over-hyped.  We'll
<BR>
cook the books to make it look like we're in trouble.  We'll build up
<BR>
massive productive capability, which we will leave idle, expaining with
<BR>
much tearing of hair and an executive suicide or two, that it is a huge,
<BR>
kludgy, asset-devouring boondoggle, a monument to ego and incompetent
<BR>
ambition.  Just the sort of story that will be irresistable to our
<BR>
soon-to-be-victims ne competitors.  And then, when all is in readiness, one
<BR>
fine day, the sun will come up, and they will find that we have shorted
<BR>
every last share of their stock.  Every farthing of their net worth will be
<BR>
transferred into our accounts.  We will be cranking out product in vast
<BR>
quantities and their entire industrial edifice will be a giant
<BR>
non-performance-art museum slash scrap heap.  And they will be standing in
<BR>
their shit-stained guccis wondering what the fuck hit them.
<BR>
<P>(Much hooting and hollering, stomping of feet,  shouts of &quot;uber, uber,
<BR>
uber,...&quot;, &quot;I want to have your baby!&quot; from both genders, undergarments
<BR>
flying through the air, wails of ecstasy, etc.)
<BR>
<P>Potp:  Yes, yes, I know, thank you.  But wait.  It's not over yet, and it's
<BR>
not all sweetness and light.  &quot;What could be bad?&quot; you say.  Well, although
<BR>
our uberDomination of the planet will be complete, our former adversaries
<BR>
stripped of their now-clearly-never-was-genuine nobility (based as it was
<BR>
on crass--not to mention ill-gotten--cash) and desolate, and the little
<BR>
people--unwashed wretches that they are--looking upon us as gods
<BR>
(squabbling happily among themselves, no doubt, the self-satisfied little
<BR>
shits).  Well, as pleasant as that may sound, it must also be noted that
<BR>
everyone on the planet will now be fat, dumb, and happy, and embarked on a
<BR>
carefree new career of self-actualization, self-enhancement, and
<BR>
self-fullfilment.   In short, our work will be done here, there will be no
<BR>
more dragons to slay, neither in nature, nor in our fellow man.  Plus, our
<BR>
money will be worthless.  Bottom line: we'll be broke and out of a job.  Ouch!
<BR>
<P>But, not to worry my friends.  Just grab your tools and your legacy of
<BR>
compulsive uber-achievement, and remember those three little words:  Total
<BR>
Galactic Domination.
<BR>
<P>Or as the late great Carl Sagan was wont to say (Cheesy Carl Sagan voice):
<BR>
<P>&quot;Billions and billions of stars to fuck with.&quot;
