<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What is my definition of &quot;existence&quot;?  I don't offer one.  Instead, I
</EM><BR>
accept
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Rand's view that existence is an axiomatic concept -- any attempt to
</EM><BR>
define
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it results in a circular definition, any attempt to deny it assumes it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are willing, Daniel, to more or less identify &quot;existence&quot;,
</EM><BR>
&quot;actuality&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and &quot;event&quot;, then the definition can proceed along the lines of &quot;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which can be located within, and specified in terms of, an n-dimensional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manifold&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily.  I could, e.g., say that the universe exists.  In fact,
<BR>
existence is literally everything that exists, which would include
<BR>
everything, including stuff we don't know about.  It's possible that some of
<BR>
these things could exist in a non-spatial way.  Restricting existence
<BR>
beforehand to some current chic mathematical representation is akin to
<BR>
restricting it to, say, Platonic solids (if we lived in Ancient Greece) or
<BR>
the four elements (of the same period).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of necessity, this manifold is metric; for example, &quot;time&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metrical time, not &quot;duration&quot; etc.  If you apply the Principle of
</EM><BR>
Sufficient
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Reason to the &quot;manifold&quot;, you encounter new problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>You do.  I make no such claims.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This gets us away from the linguistic traps set by the conflation of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;is&quot; of predication [description] and the &quot;is&quot; of identity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The approach I personally prefer is to treat things as &quot;virtual objects&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which which &quot;exist&quot; only in terms of their relations with each other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is, they are completely specified by their relationships. To have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationships is to exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>To be is to be something.  To be is to have an identity, or to be is to be
<BR>
an identity.  To be aware of something, on whatever level, is to enter into
<BR>
a relationship with it.  Indentification, to whatever degree, is a
<BR>
relational process.
<BR>
<P>To perceive something, I think one must be able to discriminate it, to
<BR>
delineate it perceptually -- not necessarily conceptually -- from other
<BR>
things.  Thus, I perceive the window this email is in.  I see it as a
<BR>
distinction entity.  Several hours ago, I was perceiving the notes in a
<BR>
melody -- i.e., discriminating it from background noise, etc.  Note the
<BR>
process is the same in many important aspects for both things.  Now it would
<BR>
be an error of judgment if I thought that the window I'm typing this into
<BR>
actually is closer than, say, the wallpaper I currently have on my desktop.
<BR>
(Truth be told, my wallpaper is nothing but blackness.:)  Still, I
<BR>
discriminate the window, regardless of my judgments -- whether they be
<BR>
correct or no.
<BR>
<P>Why this little detour?  Well, virtual objects exist too, though that
<BR>
doesn't mean I'm going to bump into one on the way to work tomorrow.  And,
<BR>
yes, to do anything (e.g., &quot;have relationships&quot;) implies existence, of what
<BR>
sort remains to be determined.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; None of the above is a panacea; the major hurdle to overcome is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confusion of epistemology and ontology when trying get your bearings.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree we must be wary of such confusions.  At the same time, we must be
<BR>
aware of the dialectical relation between what we know and what exists.  Our
<BR>
epistemology can't be totally free of our ontology.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Extant ergo cogito!&quot;
