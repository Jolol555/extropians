<P><EM>&gt; Of course, this gives rise to some pretty ugly ambiguities.  Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  improperly handled DNA evidence a technicality or an abuse?  If we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  really very oh-so-sure it's uncontaminated, but the possibility still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  remains, what now? (Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are instructed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to consider the follow evidence as only sort of admissible.)  Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Greg could speak to the question of whether there could be a clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  delineation between technicality and abuse?
</EM><BR>
<P>Lee has correctly cited Mapp v. Ohio as the genesis of modern exclusionary 
<BR>
rule evidence.  Like him, I think that the exclusionary rule appears to be 
<BR>
the most effective tool developed to date to curb enforcement abuses.  The 
<BR>
Mapp jurisprudence requires a continuing review of law enforcement practice 
<BR>
by the courts to determine whether &quot;fundamental&quot; rights have been compromised 
<BR>
by a particular police practice, but they have to do that sort of thing all 
<BR>
the time.
<BR>
<P>Of course we DO now have two parallel prosecutorial forces disciplining 
<BR>
enforcement abuse: 1) In the extreme, police officers and other state 
<BR>
officials can be held criminally liable for excessive use of force or other 
<BR>
abuses and 2) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created both public and private 
<BR>
civil remedies.  These limiting factors only seem to be effective in extreme 
<BR>
cases, though.
<BR>
<P>As for your practical question, I can tell you as a practicing trial lawyer 
<BR>
that evidence is either &quot;in&quot; or its &quot;out&quot; - limiting instructions from the 
<BR>
bench don't do anything but draw additional attention to the stuff you're 
<BR>
trying to minimize.  As we say down here in Texas, &quot;Once you've swung the 
<BR>
skunk in front of the jury box, you can't get the stink out.&quot;
