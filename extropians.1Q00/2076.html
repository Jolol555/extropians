<EM>&gt; &gt; I am wondering how representative is the World Wide Web of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exists in the Real World? Do you think that the way that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behave in that medium is representative of their behavior in real life?

<EM>&gt; Well, I'm rather quiet and shy in person.  Does that give you

<P>He's not kidding, list.  He *really is* that way in the flesh.  {8^D
<BR>
I never woulda guessed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; More specifically, my experience on the net (15+ years) confirms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea that people's behavior interacting with others is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly shaped by the medium in which they they interact.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.  I think people use the web as a great mindscape in which to
<BR>
live out one's fantasy life.  It is a better medium than any I can imagine:
<BR>
its perfectly safe, it costs little or nothing, the emotional investment
<BR>
in any online relationship is a big goose egg, so anyone can walk
<BR>
away from one effortlessly.  One can be anything one wants, without
<BR>
consequence.  One can create persona, destroy same, all *completely*
<BR>
without consequence!  What other area of life allows such freedom?
<BR>
<P>And while I am on this topic, what other medium *allows* such
<BR>
perfect honesty?  Think about that: where else can you share
<BR>
with others *exactly who you are* and what is *really* inside
<BR>
you?  I reveal to internet friends stuff that I would be reluctant to
<BR>
tell my very best life companions, and consequently, it allows us
<BR>
to better know ourselves.  We actually spend time trying to search
<BR>
out and understand disconnected fragments of bio-code that wander
<BR>
around in our brains, out of context but in there just the same.
<BR>
<P>The internet and the w^3 represent the greatest breakthru in
<BR>
human understanding and self knowledge ever invented.
<BR>
<P>I have wandered far from Amara's original post that was about
<BR>
the fact that people take advantage of those who generously
<BR>
offer themselves.  This applies all areas of life, not just the web.
<BR>
<P>Amara, I speak for all of us: we hope you will continue to post
<BR>
occasionally on extropians, and we understand your disillusionment.
<BR>
You are among our most valuable players.  spike
