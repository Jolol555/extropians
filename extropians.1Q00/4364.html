A gaggle of medical ethicists had a conference in Philadelphia last week. It was about
<BR>
the need for death. Apparently all these people are smart enough to dress and feed
<BR>
themselves without help and some have even learned to read and write. They learned how
<BR>
to write doctoral dissertations and how receive government grants. It made them more
<BR>
ethical. I guess that's how they became so much more moral than you or me.
<BR>
Here are a few of the things these wise sages had to say:
<BR>
<P>&quot;We can't ban this  [longer life] research but we can make it socially despicable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot; The finitude of human life is a blessing whether he knows it or not.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;To delay death is to delay union with God.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;[immortality is] a pagan and sub Christian quest.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;To argue that human life is better without death is to argue human life would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be better without being human.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The really strange thing is that I read about this in the Science section of the
<BR>
New York Times, not the religion section or the comics. I said it before I'll say
<BR>
it again, medical ethicists are the lowest form of human life.
