<EM>&gt; What I want to know is are there people who have read Ralph's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technical essay:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The Molecular Repair of the Brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html">http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and who *still* believe cryonics is infeasible?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By infeasible, I mean do you have concrete reasons to believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that something Ralph says is in gross error or missing in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; details of how one would molecularly reassemble the damage caused by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freezing?  Another way of asking the same question is -- How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can you believe that trillions of nanobots with collective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultra-human intelligence could *not* reassemble the 3D jig-saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puzzle left by your frozen brain?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am signed up for cryonics, but I have never found this essay
<BR>
completely convincing.  It seems to gloss over the hard part, which
<BR>
is the possibility of near-universal damage to the synaptic structures
<BR>
which we believe encode memories.  Cryonicist Mike Darwin has written
<BR>
many times about the damage he sees to brain tissue which has been
<BR>
cryopreserved using current protocols.  He sees devastating damage,
<BR>
ice crystals cutting everywhere, breaking and tearing tissues apart as
<BR>
they grow, making things look like a bulldozer has come through.
<BR>
<P>Ralph writes of evidence that brain tissue can withstand conversion of
<BR>
up to 60% of water to ice and maintain some level of functionality,
<BR>
and says that current protocols have kept the ice level below 40%.
<BR>
But these experiments are not able to rule out the possibility of damage
<BR>
sufficient to eradicate memory.  They are able to get some brain waves
<BR>
and other evidence that neurons are functioning to some degree, but
<BR>
there is obviously significantly damage.
<BR>
<P>Ralph also suggests that because synaptic structures are large, composed
<BR>
of tens of thousands of atoms, that this will facilitate the task of
<BR>
reconstructing them.  However this size is meaningless if the damage is
<BR>
occuring at this scale.  If a large fraction of these 10000 atoms are
<BR>
badly disrupted it may not be possible to figure out exactly how they
<BR>
were arranged before freezing.
<BR>
<P>Most of the latter part of the essay discusses the feasibility of
<BR>
measuring atoms and moving them around, and I am willing to stipulate
<BR>
to that.  It is the middle step here, where we use our computer models to
<BR>
figure out where things were before the damage occured, that troubles me.
<BR>
<P>The best analogy I can suggest is that the brain may be like a city.
<BR>
When it is frozen, it undergoes a terrible bombardment, and buildings are
<BR>
damaged or destroyed, rubble lying in the streets everywhere.  In the
<BR>
aftermath, people can sweep up and get things going after a fashion,
<BR>
piles of rubble here and there.  It can function to a limited extent,
<BR>
but it is not at all the city it was before.  This is like the cat brain
<BR>
spontaneously recovering brain waves.
<BR>
<P>To rebuild the brain is like a team of archeologists reconstructing
<BR>
the city, figuring out where each piece of rubble goes, getting the
<BR>
architecture back where it was.  That's probably not going to be possible.
<BR>
We can put something together that may look nice, but it is an educated
<BR>
guess at best.  Real cities have idiosyncracies and quirks, and when
<BR>
those are lost in the rubble they will never be restored.  What we end
<BR>
up with is a ficticious city, one which has similarities to what was
<BR>
there before, but the original city is lost forever.
<BR>
<P>I don't know that the brain necessarily works like this; maybe there
<BR>
will be enough information for a full restoration.  But it seems to me
<BR>
that it is possible that this is the situation, and that this model is
<BR>
consistent with the limited studies which have been done.  If so then
<BR>
Ralph's reasoning is incorrect, and from the available data we cannot
<BR>
conclude that cryonics is especially likely to work.
