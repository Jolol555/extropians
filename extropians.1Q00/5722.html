<P>Bye, Bye, Miss Iridium Pie
By Bob Miller
<P>Sung to the tune of:
Bye, Bye Miss American Pie, by Don McClean
<P>Long, long time ago I can still remember how the funding made me smile
And I knew if we had our time that we could make that payload shine,
And maybe make the launch occur on time
But '95 made me shiver with every build that we'd deliver
Bad news in the high bay, I couldn't go one more day.
I can't remember if I sighed when I read how the lawyers lied
Something touched me deep inside the day the funding died.
<P>So bye bye Miss Iridium pie, spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Them good old days have now gone by
Knowing this'll be the day that it dies
This'll be the day that it dies.
<P>Did you write the specs we love and do you have faith in the ones above?
And did you like the shirts we wore, did you believe in the 3 oh 4?
Well I knew the facts and I spoke to Jim, cause I was standing right
next to
him
They both kicked down the rack and then ran away out back.
I was a lonely old software hack with a stack of cards and a line of jack
But I knew I was on my back the day the funding died.
I started singing:
<P>Bye bye Miss Iridium pie; spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Them good old boards are way up high
Knowing this'll be the day that they die
This'll be the day that they die.
<P>Well 10 years have now gone by since the gleam got in Bary's eye
But that's not what was to be.
When investors sang in the court of law in a place where truth brings on awe
In a voice that sounds like Craig McCaw.
And while the team was looking down
The lawyers stole what we had found; the courtroom was adjourned
Bankruptcy was returned!
And while the judge read a book on sharks, the lawyers danced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the funding died.
We started singing:
<P>Bye bye Miss Iridium pie; spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Some good old boys paid seventy five
But this'll be the day that it dies
This'll be the day that it dies.
<P>Helter Skelter in the summer swelter the cows pies smell and we seek
shelter,
Our cubicles are all in a row, and we go in and pray for snow.
But we know not how it might go
Hacker lined up 20 deep. They try to code but need the sleep.
We all lay down to snooze, but then someone breaks out the booze.
Pizza comes and we go wild, the peppers fly 'cause it too mild.
Do you recall what was the deal the day the funding died?
We started humming:
<P>Bye bye Miss Iridium pie; spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Them good old rockets reached the sky
But this'll be the day that it dies
This'll be the day that it dies.
<P>In there we were all in one place trying hard to get in space
With no time left to start again.
So all be nimble, all be quick, the build is due or we'll be sick
'Cause coding is the devil's only due
And as I watched the rocket flare, all eyes left had turned to stare,
Bloodshot, tired , and burned to hell.
Smiling sweet in the fiery swell, flames climbed high into the sky and we
all clapped 'till I thought we'd cry
Before the funding died. We started singing:
<P>Bye bye Miss Iridium pie; spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Them good old days are now gone by
And this'll be the day that it dies
This'll be the day that it dies
<P>I met a man who had the &quot;sight:&quot; I asked him if the program might...
But he just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the big high bay where I'd seen the payloads years before,
But the man there said the payloads wouldn't play.
In the halls the techies sighed, the coders laughed, and the testers cried,
Not a word was spoken, the stations all were broken.
And the three things I admire most: beer, cheese, and hot french toast,
I'll be eating out on the coast, the day the funding dies:
<P>And I'll be singing:
Bye bye Miss Iridium pie; spent our millions and our billions but we made
them fly
Those crosslinks work but we don't know why
And this'll be the day that it dies
This'll be the day that it dies
