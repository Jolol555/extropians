<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big
</EM><BR>
scary
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human
</EM><BR>
rights?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a
</EM><BR>
consumer
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that
</EM><BR>
ability
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You seem to have missed the antecedent &quot;if national sovreignity ends or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanes...&quot; Nobody would claim that this is the case today.  National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sovreignity is alive and well, for better or worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>All too true - -and it might not be a completely bad thing, especially
<BR>
considering the _official_ alternative is world government.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;allowed to become law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Examples, please.  Even if that is the case, that is not what *I*
</EM><BR>
advocate
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (at least not yet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a problem of entailment of consequences.  You find it in policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debate more than anywhere else, IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alice:  We should not abide by your proposal that X, because Y will follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from it.  (where Y is something nasty)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bob:  But I'm not proposing that Y.  I'm proposing that X.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clearly, Bob's making a kind of mistake here.  Assuming that X does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *indeed* lead to Y, you CAN'T just propose X without proposing that X &amp; Y.
</EM><BR>
<P>A very clear way of putting it.  Few people advocate Y, they usually
<BR>
advocate X.  Just as in when people advocate economic equality.  They do not
<BR>
typically advocate that we all be poor and live under all manner of
<BR>
controls, yet this generally follows from economic equality.
<BR>
<P>[super big snip of lots of great material]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So ubiquitous surveilance promotes despotism; since despotism is nasty, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the extent that we can prevent ubiquitous surveilance, we should.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  This has historically been the case too.  Look at any dictatorship
<BR>
that has survived longer than a few weeks, and one typically sees huge
<BR>
secret police organizations and neighbors turning in neighbors a la Orwell's
<BR>
_Nineteen Eighty-Four_.  Granted, this is not ubiquitous surveillance, but,
<BR>
it appears, the close one gets to it, the worse life looks.
<BR>
<P>And it might be my knee jerk reaction, BUT pulling my hand away from flames
<BR>
has often been a good thing.:)
<BR>
<P>Vivamus!
