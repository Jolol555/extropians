<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, what is the short list of skills that we would recommend?
</EM><BR>
<P>This has really got me going now.  Short list?
<BR>
<P>0)  Reading
<BR>
1)  Reasoning
<BR>
2)  Programming?
<BR>
3)  Speaking?
<BR>
4)  'Rithmetic?

<P>Poverty is a great motivator.  It was for me.  On the other
<BR>
hand, it motivated me to do the wrong things.  My poverty during
<BR>
college motivated me to study hard, yet it also caused me to
<BR>
choose a major (engineering) which I would not have chosen
<BR>
otherwise.  I would have chosen astronomy, which is exactly
<BR>
what my younger and richer cousin did.
<BR>
<P>How many of us ate top ramen noodles in college?  They
<BR>
could be purchased for 11 cents a pack; two of them
<BR>
with koolaid made a 25-cent nutrient-free meal.  I and
<BR>
my compatriots practically lived on the stuff for four years.
<BR>
Inappropriate for today's young scholars.  We crammed
<BR>
four of us into an apartment made for two.  We bought not
<BR>
one stitch of clothing the whole time, or if so, from the
<BR>
Goodwill.  {8-]  We bought our books used, and resold
<BR>
them at the end of the term.  [Fortunately I have been
<BR>
able to locate and rebuy a copy almost all of them.]
<BR>
<P>There was a Newsweek cover that came out in '81 titled
<BR>
&quot;Wandering Jobless in America&quot; with a young family
<BR>
in a worn out pickup huddled under a freeway overpass
<BR>
cooking over a campfire.   I removed that cover and
<BR>
posted it above my desk with a sign saying &quot;STUDY
<BR>
HARD spike, otherwise this is YOU, pal.&quot;
<BR>
<P>At the end of my schooling, I was able to pack everything
<BR>
I owned into *one old suitcase* which I tied onto the
<BR>
back of a very well used motorcycle, rode to Seattle
<BR>
to start my career.  How very different will be the experience
<BR>
of the new generation!  Honest to dog, my friends I cannot
<BR>
even *imagine* what it would be like to start one's college
<BR>
or one's adult life with the money-thing *already* out of the
<BR>
way.  What is the motivator?  Why work?  Why bother?
<BR>
Do we have any rich young among us who know that road?
<BR>
<P>Sorry about the long windy post but consider: how many
<BR>
of us were brought up to toil in order to help out our family?
<BR>
None perhaps: we were past that as a society by the time
<BR>
most of us were born.  But now, how many were taught
<BR>
to toil in order to earn money, to trade for the toys we
<BR>
wanted?  Most, right?
<BR>
<P>OK, now, consider what has happened to manufacturing
<BR>
and society since then, consider the kids born in the 90s.
<BR>
This whole concept will not sell to them, reason:  *They
<BR>
dont have the room* or the time for the toys they want.  There
<BR>
are few kids and many adults now, so they get gifts all the time,
<BR>
and secondly, plastic toys are really cheap!  So my 6 yr old
<BR>
friend has a bedroom crammed to the RAFTERS
<BR>
with barbie doll junk, with video games, with trucks and
<BR>
cars and stuffed animals, so now, why should they toil
<BR>
or do *anything* the least bit unpleasant to have more
<BR>
of... this stuff?  You could randomly go into her room
<BR>
and collect a lawn-sized garbage bag full of randomly
<BR>
chosen toys to haul away, she would never miss them.
<BR>
Furthermore she has a couple hundred dollars in loose
<BR>
bills her aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc, have sent her,
<BR>
yet is without a clue where she would put the toys that
<BR>
she could purchase.
<BR>
<P>No matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to say
<BR>
that hard work no longer matters, only correct investment
<BR>
strategy.  That goes so hard against everything I have
<BR>
always believed, I just cannot grok that message.
<BR>
<P>Is this not *exactly* the future we often talk about on this list?
<BR>
Manufacturing goes exponential, stuff gets really cheap,
<BR>
people have plenty of the necessities and many of the luxuries,
<BR>
without really even trying.  Security cameras are everywhere,
<BR>
never blinking, in the daycare, in the school, on the playground,
<BR>
the kids dont mind a bit.  They always just *assume* they are
<BR>
being watched always, they know no other way.  Privacy?
<BR>
Whats that?  Hunger?  Want?  Never heard of it.
<BR>
<P>We question our most fundamental values.  But it isnt future;
<BR>
its already here, at least for today's very young.  Ill be damned
<BR>
if I know how to guide them.  spike
