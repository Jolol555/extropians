Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietary polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 8000, a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nonfermented polymer laxative, strongly suppresses azoxymethane-induced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon of rats, as shown in a previous study
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(D. E. Corpet et al., Carcinogenesis (Lond.), 20: 915-918, 1999). In the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;present study, we tested the effect of PEG administered during either
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;initiation or postinitiation, the dose-response effect of PEG, the regressive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of PEG on established ACF, and the preventive effect of PEG on colon
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cancers in rats. The general design was to initiate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;carcinogenesis in F344 rats by a single injection of azoxymethane (20 mg/kg)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to randomize the animals 7 days later to AIN-76 diets containing 5% PEG
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or no PEG (control). At termination, ACF and tumors were scored blindly by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;single observer. The administration of 5% PEG for 32 days to groups of 10
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;female rats in either food or drinking water reduced the number of ACF by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;factor of 8 (P = 0.0002) and reduced the number of large ACF by a factor of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20-30 (P = 0.002). No protection was afforded when PEG was given only during
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the initiation phase. Diets containing 0%, 0.5%, 2%, or 5% PEG fed for 35
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;days to four groups of male rats inhibited ACF in a dose-dependent manner (P
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; 0.0001). The administration of a 5% PEG diet for 41 days, starting 42 days
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after carcinogen injection, led to a 73% decrease in the number of ACF (P &lt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0001). Dietary PEG thus caused the regression of established ACF.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Macroscopic tumors were evaluated by histology in rats that had been fed a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;high-fat diet containing cooked casein to promote tumor growth for 81 days.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this accelerated model of carcinogenesis, dietary PEG suppressed the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occurrence of colon adenomas and carcinomas: the incidence of tumors
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;decreased from 70% to 10% (P = 0.005); and the multiplicity decreased from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 to 0.1 tumor(s)/rat (P = 0.003). No cancer was detected
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the PEG-fed rats. Taken together, these results suggest that PEG could be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a potent anticancer agent in the postinitiation phase of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;carcinogenesis. Because PEG is a substance that is generally recognized as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;safe (GRAS list, Food and Drug Administration), its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cancer-preventive features could be tested in humans.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulking fibers and high water intake may decrease colon carcinogenesis in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rats, and the risk of colorectal cancer in humans. We
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;speculated that a non-fermented polymer,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 8000, which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increases stool moisture, might protect rats against colon carcinogenesis.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty female F344 rats were given a single injection of azoxymethane (20
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mg/kg), and 7 days later randomized to AIN76 diets containing PEG (to provide
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3 g/kg body wt/day), or no PEG (control). Diets were given ad libitum for 105
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;days, then colon carcinogenesis was assessed by the aberrant crypt foci (ACF)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;test. ACF were scored blindly by a single observer. Dietary feeding of PEG
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;almost suppressed ACF larger than one crypt, and strikingly decreased the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;total number of ACF per rat. PEG-fed rats had 100 times less large ACF than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;controls (0.8 and 83 respectively, P = 0.00001). PEG-fed rats had 20 times
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;less total ACF than control (six and 107 ACF/rat, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two treated rats had no detectable ACF. PEG is 10 times more potent than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other chemopreventive agents in this model. Since PEG is generally recognized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as safe, its cancer-preventive features could be tested in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;humans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoration by polyethylene glycol of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;characteristics of intestinal differentiation in subpopulations of the human
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT29.

<BR>
Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The human colonic cancer cell line HT29 is morphologically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;undifferentiated in standard culture conditions. The cells were incubated for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;30 s in polyethylene glycol (27%, v/v),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then washed, and refed with standard medium. In these conditions of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;treatment, polyethylene glycol was unable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to induce a significant cell multinucleation. Three wk after the treatment,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;circular &quot;flat-foci&quot; developed in the culture, which consisted of circular
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;monolayers of polarized cells. These subpopulations were isolated, then grown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as independent lines (lines 27, 28, 30, and 31) in standard culture
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conditions, and characterized. Two types of differentiated cells were present
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in these lines, namely, enterocytic cells and mucus-secreting goblet cells.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These characteristics of intestinal differentiation were found to be stable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;during the long-term culture of these lines in standard medium. We were able
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to isolate from line 27 a clonal derivative (C1.27H) exhibiting 2 lineages of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;differentiation, as assessed by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;immunoblot analysis of cell membranes with anti-sucrase-isomaltase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antibodies, and enzyme activities. Sucrase-isomaltase was present in two
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forms, namely, the high-molecular-weight precursor and the cleaved subunits.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the C1.27H cells were found to be significantly less tumorigenic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;than the parental HT29 cells in both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tests. This stably differentiated cell clone could represent the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cancer derivative of the normal stem cells of the intestinal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;crypt. It is therefore a possible model system for the study of intestinal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cell differentiation.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional note by poster:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High molecular weight peg 8000 appears to be useful in the treatment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of colon cancer. Considering its very high safety margins relative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to conventional chemotherapy, it deserves first consideration for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;further research. (too bad it is not patentable!)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to see addressed is whether low 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;molecular weight peg 200 could be useful in the treatment of other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cancers. Since this would be absorbable from the gastrointestinal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tract, it might be active against a wide variety of tumors.
