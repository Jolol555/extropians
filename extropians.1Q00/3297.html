<EM>&gt; You've missed my point entirely. I have read any and everything I can on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jacking in, etc. Thanks for giving me a couple titles, but...  Most of us
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; read sci-fi. I want to know what THE LIST envisions their OWN personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience of uploading, not what sci-fi authors think. I believe it might
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; valuable to do so *on list* since this is the pool of talent that is most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inherently prone towards researching and making such a thing possible --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly NOT as fiction, but as their own reality. I even know people who
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; studying neuroscience to help it happen!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Now there's an interesting question.
<BR>
<P>Keeping in mind that actual uploading is much, much harder that
<BR>
garden-variety VR, I think you need to expect a pretty radical experience.
<BR>
Uploading required some combination of nanotechnology, advanced neuroscience
<BR>
and AI (you can trade off one parameter for the others, so we can't predict
<BR>
the exact mix, but at least two of them have to be pretty mature).
<BR>
Obviously, we aren't talking about something that could happen tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>So, I'd expect that less drastic methods of intelligence enhancement will
<BR>
come first.  By the time you can upload everyone will already have a
<BR>
wearable computer system with neural interfaces, and you'll be used to
<BR>
constantly interacting with non-sentient AI assistants of all sorts.  You'll
<BR>
already be used to being able to look out of any unsecured sensor in the
<BR>
solar system, be it a camera or a neutrino detector.  You'll already have
<BR>
lots of experience with VR worlds, your interaction with the real world is
<BR>
heavily virtualized, and you've had a chance to play with real-world
<BR>
physical modifications.
<BR>
<P>What does a person in that situation do with uploading?
<BR>
<P>The main difference I see is that it removes a lot of inertia from the
<BR>
system.  Now you can inhabit any kind of physical body as easily as visiting
<BR>
a web site.  You can have an equally good interface into any VR world you
<BR>
care to visit, instead of being limited by the physical performance of your
<BR>
interface equipment.  You can run yourself faster or slower than real time,
<BR>
and your software interfaces aren't limited by the bandwidth of organic
<BR>
tissue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From there on you're essentially an AI implemented in lots of messy legacy
</EM><BR>
code.  There should be a huge market for mental modifications, since some
<BR>
significant fraction of the population is going to upload themselves, and
<BR>
self-enhancement should become progressively easier as you replace chunks of
<BR>
neuron simulation with something more manageable.
