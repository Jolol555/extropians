Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that overexpression of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;glutathione reductase in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increases resistance to oxidative stress and retards the aging process.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Transgenic flies were generated by microinjection and subsequent mobilization
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a P element construct containing the genomic glutathione reductase gene of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila, with 4 kb upstream and 1.5 kb downstream of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;coding region. Transgenic animals stably overexpressed glutathione reductase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by up to 100% throughout adult life and under continuous exposure to 100%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxygen or air. Under hyperoxic conditions, overexpressors had increased
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity, decreased accrual of protein carbonyls, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dramatically increased survival rates after recovery from a semi-lethal dose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of 100% oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, overexpression of glutathione
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reductase had no effect on longevity, protein carbonyl
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;content, reduced glutathione, or glutathione disulfide content, although the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;total consumption of oxygen was slightly decreased. Glutathione reductase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;activity does not appear to be a rate-limiting factor in anti-aging defenses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;under normoxic conditions, but it may become a limiting factor when the level
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of oxidative stress is elevated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;N-acetylcysteine slows down ageing and increases the life span of

&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila melanogaster.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ageing can be defined as the time-dependent decline of physiological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;functions of an organism. The molecular causes for the ageing process are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple, involving both genetic and environmental factors. It has been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed that antioxidants may positively influence the ageing process,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protecting the organism against free radical-induced damage. Here we show
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has a life-extending effect on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary uptake of NAC results in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dose-dependent increase in median and maximum life span. Flies fed on 1 mg/ml
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;NAC food live 16.6% longer; at 10 mg/ml, life span increases by 26.6%. We
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have examined the effect of NAC treatment on protein and RNA levels: we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observe an NAC-dependent increase in absolute amounts of total RNA and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ribosomal RNA, but no differences in protein levels. The NAC effect on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity may involve differential expression of specific
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mRNA genes, as suggested by RNA finger-printing experiments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of melatonin and pineal peptide preparation epithalamin on life span
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and free radical oxidation in Drosophila melanogaster.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shown previously that epithalamin delays age-related changes in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reproductive and immune systems and increases the life span of mice and rats.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These effects could be mediated by stimulating influences of epithalamin on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;synthesis and secretion of melatonin and on free radical processes. A
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;comparative study on the effect of epithalamin and melatonin on both the life
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;span of Drosophila melanogaster (strain HEM) and on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intensity of lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative enzymes in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their tissues was the main aim of this work. Melatonin and epithalamin was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;added to the nutrition medium (100 micrograms/ml) during 2-3rd age of larvas.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For survival analysis the flies were passed (five coupes per vessel) each 3-7
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;days. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated as the level of ketodienes (KD) and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conjugated hydroperoxides (CHP) in fly tissues at the age of 11 days.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismuatse (SOD) and catalase was evaluated as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;well. The mean, median and maximum life span (MLS) were estimated. Mortality
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate (MR) was calculated as alpha in the Gompertz equation (R = Ro (exp alpha
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;t) and mortality rate doubling time (MRDT) as in 2/alpha. These parameters in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups of male and female flies exposed to melatonin and in male flies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exposed to epithalamin were no different from the parameters for controls.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, exposure to epithalamin was followed in females by a significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in mean life span (by 17%, P &lt; 0.02), of median (by 26%), of MLS by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14% and by a 2.12 times decrease of MR (P &lt; 0.01) and MRDT (by 32%) compared
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with female controls. The level of CHP and KD in the tissues of male control
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flies was 40 and 49% less than that in females and indirectly correlates with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;male life span. Exposure to melatonin was followed by a decrease in the level
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of CHP and KD in females and the deletion of sex differences in them.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposure to epithalamin significantly decreased the level of CHP and KD in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;female flies compared to controls (2.3 and 3.4 times, respectively, P &lt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.001). Exposure to melatonin failed to influence the activity of catalase in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;males but increased it in females by 24% (P &lt; 0.02) and failed to influence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SOD activity both in males and females. Exposure to epithalamin was followed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by a significant increase in activity of catalse, 20% in males and 7% in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;females and by an increase in SOD activity in males (41%). Thus, it was shown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that exposure to epithalamin significantly increases the mean life span and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MLS of female D.melanogaster and slowed down their aging rate by 2.12 times.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect is in good agreement with the inhibiting effect of epithalamin in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipid peroxidation processes in fly tissues.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Several studies have shown that, contrary to what occurs in rodents and in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some invertebrate species, food restriction has no positive effect on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity in Drosophila melanogaster.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Chippindale et al. (1993) reported that flies subjected to food
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;restriction, by modulating the yeast level, could live longer. In the present
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;study we used the same yeast levels as Chippindale et al. in an attempt to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;confirm these results. No positive effect of food restriction on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;longevity could be observed in either sex in mated and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;virgin flies.
