<P><EM>&gt; &gt; but if you do something in a foreign country that it legal there, but

<EM>&gt; &gt; illegal in the U.S., or in your home state, you can be prosecuted when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you get back, as in the U.S. companies that payed the expected foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; backsheesh and then got prosecuted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe in the cases you cite Phil, the obivious solution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to give up your U.S. citizenship before you get adventurous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another solution is to live overseas and reveal as little as possible about
<BR>
what you're doing there...just have to mail those tax forms back to the US
<BR>
every year, but that $70,000 deductible certainly helps.
<BR>
<P>Funny that it almost seems like Hong Kong (now a part of evil Communist
<BR>
China) is more free than the US in some respects owing to the greater
<BR>
degree of chaos over here...for example the digital DJ thing I'm doing, as
<BR>
I understand it mp3 DJing is illegal by definition under US and most
<BR>
European copyright laws, though I'm not sure anyone's been busted for it
<BR>
yet.  But here in HK, getting charged with violating copyright would be
<BR>
absolutely unthinkable...so we can continue our artistic investigations in
<BR>
peace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Legally it would seem they would be on very swampy ground trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prosecute the activities of non-citizen in foreign lands.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha.  But I wouldn't say there is no precedent at all, what about Noriega?
