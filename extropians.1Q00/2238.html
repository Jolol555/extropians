<EM>&gt; I think not. As best I can recall the subs you're thinking of used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; catalyzed high-concnetration hydrogen peroxide H2O2 when they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating in &quot;rocket&quot; mode. They got steam to run turbines and oxygen as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; output. Not sure what they did with the oxygen.
</EM><BR>
<P>They didn't quite work that way. IIRC, they just catalytically cracked
<BR>
the high-test peroxide to provide oxygen which they fed into their 
<BR>
deisel engines. The exhaust was CO2 plus water vapour, and was either
<BR>
stored or vented.
<BR>
<P>Conventional subs of the day had two propulsion systems: diesel engines
<BR>
for running on the surface at up to 20 knots, and battery-powered
<BR>
electrics, for submerged operations. The batteries were charged by
<BR>
the deisel engine (via a generator) while on the surface. (For this
<BR>
reason they're best considered as submersible boats rather than true
<BR>
submarines in the same sense as a modern nuclear boat.)
<BR>
<P>Normal subs could make maybe 10-12 knots submerged for a couple of hours
<BR>
on battery power, or 4-5 knots for 12-24 hours. A peroxide boat could
<BR>
charge along at 20+ knots for a day or two; this enabled them to make a
<BR>
much more successful getaway after an attack -- it massively increased
<BR>
the area that would have to be searched by ASW craft hunting the sub.
<BR>
<P>Peroxide boats still carried batteries and schnorkels; the use of
<BR>
peroxide to let them run their deisel engines while submerged was basically 
<BR>
an emergency get-out-of-trouble-fast measure. It was also sodding loud,
<BR>
which is why the technique fell out of favour with improvements in sonar
<BR>
after the war. (Electric and nuclear boats are _much_ quieter.)  There's
<BR>
apparently some work in hand (in Norway, IIRC) on resurrecting the idea,
<BR>
this time using a very quiet Stirling cycle engine and storing the exhaust
<BR>
gasses in a double-hull arrangement.
