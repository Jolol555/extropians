I cannot believe the nonsense that people &quot;know&quot; about intelligence.

<EM>&gt; Actually, there were two author's who cowrote the book, Richard J.

<EM>&gt; Herrnstein and Charles Murray.  Herrnstein died shortly after the book was

<EM>&gt; published.  He was seen by critics as not having the real research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience to write the  book, though he was a Harvard trained psychologist.

<P>Pardon me? Herrnstein had published extensively on both social issues (crime
<BR>
in particular) and intelligence. If anyone lacked &quot;credentials&quot; it would be
<BR>
Murray. He, however, is a smart guy with plenty of experience in dealing
<BR>
with social data and a good partner for Herrnstein. The correlational issues
<BR>
are not, in fact, rocket science (though the underlying genetics are).
<BR>
<P>It is true that neither Herrnstein nor Murray where the originators of much
<BR>
raw data and basic theory (for that turn to Jensen, Eysenck, and a host of
<BR>
other less well known names). But two points need to be clear here. Not
<BR>
having published original analyses (thought the Bell Curve contains ample
<BR>
amounts of these) does not exclude one from entering a scientific arena.
<BR>
Secondly, and risibly, no one appears to be upset when people like Gould
<BR>
(who have never published on intelligence - &quot;not a single piece of original
<BR>
research&quot;) pontificate (not analyse, merely claim) on what &quot;must&quot; be the
<BR>
case regarding differences between individuals.

and turning several sharp corners), &quot;but I suppose it will at last.  But how

curiously it twists!  It's more like a corkscrew than a path!  Well, *this*

turn goes to the hill, I suppose -- no, it doesn't! This goes straight back

to the house!  Well then, I'll try it the other way.&quot;
