<EM>&gt;         Upon reading some of the responses to Max's original post on God,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrogance and belief, it strikes me that there seems to be a sort of fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of commitment to the term &quot;atheist.&quot;  In my experience, many who call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves agnostic and cringe at the word &quot;atheist&quot; have a deep rooted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear of possible repercussions from taking a firm stand on such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-description --almost as if the slightest percentage of a possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of God Itself (usually in the traditional 'image of man' form) condemning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's soul to eternal damnation is enough to leave the loophole in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Well, that may be so in your experience. My personal position of
<BR>
agnosticism isn't born of fear of committment however, but born from a
<BR>
genuine uncertainty. As I stated before, I lean towards the belief that
<BR>
any god(s) that has come to notice in our history from any culture lacks
<BR>
evidence for their existence. However, this in no way precludes the idea
<BR>
that we are the direct creation of a higher power. And for that, I am
<BR>
uncertain as to the answer. So, I label myself as an Agnostic, because
<BR>
at my core, concerning the broadest definition of god, I am uncertain.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps others would call me a weak atheist, or rather an atheist who is
<BR>
open to further evidence. Which, looking over the last few posts on
<BR>
this, and related, threads would indicate something that isn't quite
<BR>
atheism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         Quibbling over semantics is not the real issue; the real issue is why many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational thinkers cannot trust their rational beliefs enough to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves atheists.  With all due respect to the self-proclaimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agnostics, I find such a belief position weak and compromising, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; underlying fear of commitment to one's most rational desires and thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as its basis.  The bottom line is this: either there are gods (or God, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you prefer) or there are not.  I cannot prove one way or the other, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a tremendously strong, rational belief that no God or gods exist.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those who take such an either\or, compromising view as Agnosticism, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not put much weight on any other view which they claim to support either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the same reason why many like-minded individuals could have a far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friendlier conversation with a fundamental Christian, Buddhist --whatever--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than with a non-committing Agnostic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Maybe then, when speaking with you, I would call myself an atheist who
<BR>
is willing to enterain evidence that suggests the existence of a
<BR>
Creator. But, I think it's grossly unfair to doubt a proclaimed
<BR>
Agnostics sincerety on other issues that the person in question might
<BR>
have a very hard stance. Overgeneralization (ie, stereotyping) is one of
<BR>
the worst errors I can think of when it comes to a mental model of the
<BR>
world. Because that type of heuristic cognition touches the most future
<BR>
data with the least amount of critical thinking effort.
