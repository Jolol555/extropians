<P>James, you have to keep in mind that there is a big difference
<BR>
between &quot;buildings&quot; and elevators that take things to orbit.
<BR>
With buildings, you need floors, desks, elevators and people
<BR>
to name a few non-massless objects.  The Landis paper I cited
<BR>
said nothing about building a sky-scraper many miles high.
<BR>
It was only addressing the issue of supporting space-shuttle
<BR>
mass payloads.  I suspect that space-shuttle mass payloads
<BR>
are on the order of the mass of a single floor of a typical
<BR>
office building in a major city.  [Do the arithmetic...]
<BR>
<P>There are always tradeoffs.  Do you want a machine that will
<BR>
take ~200 people into orbit slowly and expensively, or do you
<BR>
want a tower that will take 1-10 people into orbit at approximately
<BR>
the same rate, but highly repeatedly?
