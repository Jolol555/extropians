<P>I will simply comment that Moore's law is often misquoted.  In its
<BR>
*original* form (from Moore's original statements in the '60's),
<BR>
I believe that it *only* discussed circuit *density*.  That would
<BR>
imply nothing about clock speed (advances or lack thereof due to
<BR>
increases in power consumption), cache or memory bandwidth limitations,
<BR>
architecture advantages (reduced-instruction-set (RISC),
<BR>
multi-arithmetic-logic-units/chip, Very-Long-Instruction-Words, etc.).
<BR>
<P>The net effect of all of these things combined seems to produce
<BR>
an advancement rate slightly faster than Moore's original projections.
<BR>
However, in spite of the &quot;Peter's&quot; frequently crying &quot;wolf, wolf&quot;,
<BR>
there seems to be continued progress speeding up the rate of change.
<BR>
Moravec pointed this out in his recent &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to
<BR>
Transcendent Mind&quot; book, but the rate of acceleration is so low
<BR>
that it is difficult to notice.  I offered the AMD/IBM observations
<BR>
as evidence that Moravec's obervations may be accurate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus, I hope we are not using the fact that we are beating SIA's sub-Moore's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law projections to argue for near term growth substantially faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moore's law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The SIA projections are moderately conservative projections (after
<BR>
all they are an industry consensus).  However, there was a &quot;bump&quot;
<BR>
in their 1993 projections, when things came in a year or so in
<BR>
advance of the plan around 1996-1997.  They passed this off as a
<BR>
&quot;one-time&quot; occurence in the 1997 Road-Map.  It looks like history
<BR>
is repeating itself with the 1997 map.  That would imply that
<BR>
they may be consistently underestimating the rate of change.
<BR>
Its going to be interesting to see how they explain things
<BR>
in the Y2K Road-Map.
<BR>
<P>Of interest in the links from my pages is the link to the
<BR>
Petaflops II conference in '99.  Some of the papers from that
<BR>
conference on the advances that are in the prototype stages are
<BR>
very very cool.
