<EM>&gt; Robert, get a grip! Sorry to say this, but that kinda comment is what you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect to hear from kids in the locker room without an emotional clue.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I may be failing to express myself in such a way that the
<BR>
point is clear again.   I think the precise point of my comment
<BR>
is to ask the question of &quot;Why can't we view these processes (conception
<BR>
*or* abortion) with the same dispassion as brushing our teeth?&quot;
<BR>
Dispassionately, we are talking about some bags of chemical molecules!
<BR>
<P>As you point out because there is both physical  &quot;hard-wiring&quot; and social
<BR>
&quot;soft-wiring&quot; we do this more &quot;significant&quot;.  But *do* you really
<BR>
want this to be true?  Is it &quot;rational&quot; in a world where you will be
<BR>
able to design better babies from scratch?
<BR>
<P>Just so people think me not completely insenstive, I do have experiences
<BR>
that include those similar to Damien's and people close to me who have
<BR>
extreme difficulties having children.
<BR>
<P>But that doesn't keep me from asking (and perhaps wishing) that the
<BR>
emotional wringers these experiences involve should be significantly
<BR>
reinterpreted, particularly in light of the advancements in technology
<BR>
that are expected.  Damien's response perhaps point out the problems
<BR>
we may have in the future &quot;grok&quot;ing humans who have done the mental
<BR>
hardware &amp; software changes that have turned the volume controls
<BR>
on many emotional &quot;hooks&quot; to zero.
