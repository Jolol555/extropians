<A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_695000/695142.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_695000/695142.stm</A>
<BR>
<P>Finger length may be an indication of sexual orientation, a controversial 
<BR>
study has shown. 
<BR>
Scientists from California found that lesbian women have a greater difference 
<BR>
in length between their ring finger and index finger than straight women do. 
<BR>
<P>The same pattern was also found for homosexual men - but only when the 
<BR>
researchers looked at those males that had several older brothers. 
<BR>
<P>The scientists from the University of California at Berkeley were testing a 
<BR>
theory that higher levels of androgen - male sex hormones - in the womb 
<BR>
influence both finger length and sexual orientation. 
<BR>
<P>They did this by looking at the hands of 720 men and women on the streets of 
<BR>
San Francisco. The volunteers had their fingers measured and were asked 
<BR>
questions about their sexual orientation and the number of older brothers and 
<BR>
sisters in the family. 
<BR>
<P>In women, the ring finger and index finger tend to be about the same length. 
<BR>
In men, however, the index finger is usually the shorter of the two digits. 
<BR>
<P>'Masculine' pattern
<BR>
<P>What the study showed was that lesbian women also tended to have the more 
<BR>
&quot;masculine&quot; arrangement - that is, they had shorter index fingers. 
<BR>
<P>But the ratio of finger sizes in men was more complicated. Comparisons 
<BR>
between all men showed no differences. Only gay men with several older 
<BR>
brothers had an unusually &quot;masculine&quot; finger ratio - in other words, they had 
<BR>
significantly shorter index fingers. 
<BR>
<P>Having a large number of older brothers had previously been established as a 
<BR>
factor predisposing men to homosexuality, and like finger length reflects 
<BR>
prenatal androgen exposure. 
<BR>
<P>Homosexual men without older brothers had finger length ratios 
<BR>
indistinguishable from heterosexual men, indicating that factors other than 
<BR>
hormones - such as genetic influences - also contribute to sexual 
<BR>
orientation. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The results in men are more complicated but also more interesting,&quot; Dr Marc 
<BR>
Breedlove, one of the researchers, told the BBC. This is because they suggest 
<BR>
younger brothers are being exposed to higher levels of androgen in the womb 
<BR>
than their elders. 
<BR>
<P>Womb 'memory'
<BR>
<P>&quot;We think it is inescapable that the mother's body is remembering how many 
<BR>
sons she has carried before, and somehow she is then increasing the amount of 
<BR>
androgen that each subsequent son sees before birth. So the fascinating 
<BR>
questions are: where is the memory being stored in the mother's body and what 
<BR>
is she doing to change amount of androgen that each subsequent son sees.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Berkeley study has been published in Nature. Scientists in the UK have 
<BR>
given it a cautious reception. They say far more work is required to back up 
<BR>
some of the ideas contained in the research. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I think this is a possibility,&quot; said Dr Richard Sharpe, of the human 
<BR>
reproductive science unit at Edinburgh University. &quot;But no-one has actually 
<BR>
measured the levels of androgens in foetuses or the womb - you can imagine it 
<BR>
is difficult to do - so this is all speculation. It may be informed 
<BR>
speculation, but I think when we get on to a subject as touchy as sexual 
<BR>
orientation we need to clearly define what is speculation and what is fact.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Dr Sharpe said animal studies had shown how female sex hormones could affect 
<BR>
sexual differentiation in the brain and regulate sexual behaviour, but this 
<BR>
had still to be proved in humans. It could well be different, he said.
