<EM>&gt; &gt; the next ice age and the death of the *real* dragons)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	An old but relevant technology involves running current through sea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water. Dissolved salts precipitate onto a conductive mesh and liberate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hydrogen gas. Run current as long as you like, or at least until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you've reached the desired thickness of deposit. I understand this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material has about the strength of concrete, but has different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages and drawbacks. These include low-cost (just current and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrodes), easy repair (turn the current on again), a built-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network (the electrode mesh), limited construction location (under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; salt water), difficult to remodel, and aesthetics (ugly looking).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Advantages can be played up and drawback played down in science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fiction. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is definitely something I had planned on using. A very nice
<BR>
idea, and probably necessary for setting up the basic framework on
<BR>
which to build the rest of the sea construction. Possibly it could be
<BR>
done using conducting polymers made by modified bacteria or plants,
<BR>
powered by solar cells. Hmm, maybe islet farms in the tropics, where
<BR>
the constructions grow until ready to be seeded with more biotech and
<BR>
eventually harvested and sold to the highest bidder...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	I assume any Chinese Civil War will involve action against Taiwan at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some point. Without serious collapse of American military prowess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naval action among People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), US Navy, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Taiwanese forces seems reasonable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the real problem is a few million refugees (just a few millions
<BR>
because the others didn't get boats in time). This kind of ships (or
<BR>
rafts) may play a significant role in the evacuation. At this point (I
<BR>
put the civil war at 2014) biotech is not yet as good as later on and
<BR>
the national states are still forces to be reconed with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any side involved might use this technique to produce cheap hulls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for &quot;Liberty Ships&quot; or low magnetic signature mines. If your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenario has vessels using screws for propulsion then they remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vulnerable to entangling wires.  Reinforcing such traps with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrodeposition might make them more effective. On the other hand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect magnetohydrodynamic propulsion would prove very sensitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to changes in the gross electrical properties of its working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fluid. Perhaps salting (no pun intended) the sea lanes with plants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that release this material would damage or slow MHD-propelled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vessels.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Maybe a defensive water hyacinth? Especially designed to accumulate
<BR>
iron filings so that when it passes through the MHD it does real
<BR>
damage...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	If naval action plays a role in your next SF scenario, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like to make further suggestions off list.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not planned much of that, but I gladly listen to your
<BR>
suggestions. It is this kind of ideas and extrapolations I really want
<BR>
to add in.
<BR>
<P>At the start of the scenario my players will be dealing with the local
<BR>
politics of the Republic of Sichuan, but I expect the focus to move
<BR>
out globally after a while.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I think I never thanked you properly for your RPG-net review of
<BR>
BIGV. Thank you! I think it was right on spot, and mentioned a few
<BR>
things I will try to fix in new versions.
