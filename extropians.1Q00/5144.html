Subject: The Political Mauling of Darwin
<BR>
<P><P><P>Evolutionary theory today is dominated by 
<BR>
the old left wing of politics which is 
<BR>
fighting a rear guard action against today's
<BR>
new right view. In previous years, evolutionary
<BR>
theory was dominated by the old right wing.
<BR>
Both are dishonest twisters of scientific
<BR>
truth that have mauled Darwinism beyond
<BR>
recognition. No scientific idea in the
<BR>
whole history of science has ever had
<BR>
such an impact on human politics so
<BR>
that this mauling becomes inevitable.
<BR>
<P>Political correctness today pivots on organism 
<BR>
fitness altruism. This event, that is not predicted
<BR>
within Darwinism to ever be observed in nature, 
<BR>
and has never been confirmed as any observation in
<BR>
nature, is just accepted without question without
<BR>
any clear definitions of what it is, because the
<BR>
old left sensibility favors it. Dawkins is
<BR>
a paid mouthpiece of such a biased establishment 
<BR>
and is providing masses of propaganda for public
<BR>
consumption, that now fuels a multi million 
<BR>
dollar industry worldwide. Most of the
<BR>
paid work within Neo Darwinism research is 
<BR>
public funded. These people, rightly
<BR>
or wrongly, feel their jobs are under threat
<BR>
from new right politics. After the failure of
<BR>
group selection to establish organism fitness
<BR>
altruism within nature, the focus of selection
<BR>
logic was lowered to the gene level, but
<BR>
not entirely. Dawkins selfish genes were
<BR>
still reproducing themselves in organism
<BR>
generations and not within gene generations.
<BR>
Thus the false logic was born that selfish
<BR>
genes provide altruistic organisms in nature
<BR>
where organism altruism was now saved within 
<BR>
Darwinism. This entire logic is not self consistent 
<BR>
but yet another biased fabrication to now support 
<BR>
organism fitness altruism in nature. Now people can 
<BR>
suppose that if its good enough for nature then 
<BR>
it's natural for politics to insist that people 
<BR>
act in an altruistic manner within human societies.
<BR>
<P>Before WW2 the exact opposite fabrication was
<BR>
put in place to support racism and Hitler.
<BR>
Here unnatural selection replaced Darwinian
<BR>
natural selection and selfish organisms meant
<BR>
the extermination of unfit races by intent.
<BR>
Natural selection is only competition by
<BR>
default between freely competing adult 
<BR>
organisms.
<BR>
<P>Darwinism does not support any selfish or
<BR>
altruistic organisms. It predicts that
<BR>
all organisms form mutual but not necessarily
<BR>
equal associations for fitness benefit, period.
<BR>
The old left can't stand &quot;but not necessarily
<BR>
equal&quot; and the old right cannot stand &quot;mutual&quot;
<BR>
where both their fabrications of Darwinism act 
<BR>
to destroy freedom of individual choice 
<BR>
and strengthen ancient tribal totalitarianism
<BR>
sensibilities that lie dormant in everybody
<BR>
IMHO.
<BR>
<P>Both fabrications:
<BR>
1) Were public funded within scientific 
<BR>
establishments.
<BR>
<P>2) Failed to define Darwinian fitness and use it 
<BR>
in any self consistent way.
<BR>
<P>3) Had huge negative impacts on human social 
<BR>
structures.
