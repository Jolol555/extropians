<P>
I suggest that the gun debaters consider to assemble statistics on the number
<BR>
of [A] civilian guns, and [B] killings using civilian guns, both per capita
<BR>
in different parts of the planet.  This should decide whether there exists
<BR>
a positive correlation between the two, or not.  Without this data, I see
<BR>
no reason to debate this issue on the list.
<BR>
<P>I would suggest that one can solve these problems with technology.
<BR>
<P>To solve the problem of children finding and using guns, I suggest that the
<BR>
manufacturers augment their guns, so only the (registered) gun owner(s) can
<BR>
fire them.
<BR>
<P>To solve the problem of violent humans who will use guns to perform various
<BR>
violent acts towards other humans, other animals, and inamite things, I suggest
<BR>
that, when the justice system detects such a human, the justice system will
<BR>
reprogram the brain of the human using brain washing techniques, drugs, and
<BR>
brain surgery.  In addition to solve the problem at hand, this solution also
<BR>
generates a strong impulse to stop other violent humans from performing these
<BR>
violent acts.
<BR>
<P>The general question of gun freedom without this extropian angle should cease
<BR>
on this list.
