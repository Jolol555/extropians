Eliezer writes:&lt;&lt; status, or my intelligence, or my ability to make a
<BR>
&nbsp;difference.  It fell into my lap like manna from heaven.  I don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;deserve&quot; what I have any more than some guy slaving away as a janitor.
<BR>
&nbsp;Nonetheless, considering how much time I've spent working on
<BR>
&nbsp;intelligence enhancement, that I may share the bounty which the random
<BR>
&nbsp;factors have bestowed upon me, I don't think that there's anyone in the
<BR>
&nbsp;world who would tell me to do things differently.
<BR>
&nbsp;The strong exist to serve the weak, and to the abyss with Ayn Rand.- -- &gt;&gt;

<P>&lt;&lt; &gt;I say: No one exists to serve anyone. At the same time, everyone is free 
<BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;choose to serve themselves and others or both at the same time (the latter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually works best, at least in a market economy).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>And  I say: If I say I exist to serve others, and it brings me happiness, and 
<BR>
is not hurtful to myself, that is my choice. If it makes me forget about my 
<BR>
self-absorbed, self obsessed selfish self, even for a minute, it's bliss...  
<BR>
self interest bores the crap out of me. I dislike grabby people. I am 
<BR>
happiest when I am of service, because it causes inner growth, interactions 
<BR>
with random things, I enter new worlds... and learn a lot!!! And gives me a 
<BR>
lot of pride in my accomplishments - to see others change is a great 
<BR>
validation of my systems of learning.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I am talented, and grew up privileged, and I don''t deserve it nearly as 
<BR>
much as some of the little ones I help, they just didn't get the luck of the 
<BR>
draw...  
<BR>
<P><P>I dislike Ayn Rand because she consistantly proclaims &quot;don't ever let people 
<BR>
tell you what do&quot;...which is telling me what to do.... 
<BR>
I agree with e... Deserving has nada to do with it. It is a made up reason to 
<BR>
justify mean thoughts.
