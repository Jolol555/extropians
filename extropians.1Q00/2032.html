I don't follow you. I was being silly about methane, and explaining some
<BR>
genuine drawbacks of wind. You announce they are the growing-est. Great
<BR>
for them--vote with your wallet. 
<BR>
<P>Then you lose me. Things cost what they cost. Costs change over time. I
<BR>
don't want a methane powered car badly enough to build one. I like
<BR>
sailboats a lot, but they're very expensive, specialized vehicles. 
<BR>
<P>Ground-floor apartment dwellers in tightly-packed suburbs don't get to
<BR>
put up windmills, no matter how much they want to. That's real world
<BR>
stuff too. You don't have to visit Tomorrowland. You don't have to ride
<BR>
in one of the Mad Hatter's teacups, either. I am selective about &quot;early
<BR>
adoption&quot;, or I try to be. YMMV. Groovy, it's a big planet.
<BR>
<P>I am not trying to offend you, but you seem to have taken offense.
<BR>
