<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frankly, this discussion is fast growing intractably confusing to
<BR>
me -- so this refocuse on reality is very refreshing. 
<BR>
<P>what will happen?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i feel nanowar is not inevitable because nanotech advanced enough
<BR>
to make weapons would have eliminated the economic incentive to wage war
<BR>
by making more useful things. of course, human irrationality must not be
<BR>
underestimated.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in regard to a yudkowskyan transcendant mind (ytm), i do not believe
<BR>
that objective morality exists. my guesses in no particular order: #. 
<BR>
un-enhanced human intelligence will not be able to build a ytm; #. human error
<BR>
will build a ytm that is essentially catastrophic; #. a flawless yudkowskyan
<BR>
mind will be built, but it will be indistinguishable from the rest of reality
<BR>
-- ie, quiescent. of course, i still have hope for what i can not believe.
<BR>
<P>what should be done?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i must admit that i lack prescriptive opinions. since i do not
<BR>
believe in free-will, in a sense i'm just along for the ride. however, i
<BR>
do want to know what actions this discussion is debating. specifically:
<BR>
what is the near term goal to be achieved? what is the set of actions
<BR>
whose execution is in debate? what are the hypothetical conditions whose
<BR>
presence is in consensus? for example, _if_ nanowar and subsequent human
<BR>
extinction is virtually inevitable, _if_ transcendant minds can pursue momentum
<BR>
goals, and _if_ momentum goal x can be satisfactorily implemented in a sysop
<BR>
mind, would uploading ourselves into the sysop mind further the goal of
<BR>
surviving the next 50 objective years?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;btw, wouldn't it be helpful if you two implemented a tree of
<BR>
arguments and sub-arguments to make the discussion more systematic?
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
-x
