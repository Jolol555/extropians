<EM>&gt; Is there evidence to support the existence of DM?  To me it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears that it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been decided that DM MUST exist.......
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
There are at least two pieces of evidence for the notion that galaxies are
<BR>
more massive than we can account for by the visible stars and dust in those
<BR>
galaxies.  (There are probably others that I'm not aware of.)
<BR>
<P>1) Orbital dynamics.  The orbital velocity of stars at the periphery of
<BR>
observed galaxies is too fast.  If we use estimates for galactic massed
<BR>
based on the number and type of observed stars, and the mass estimates for
<BR>
those stars, then the stars on the outside of the galaxy should simply fly
<BR>
away.  The fact that they don't suggests that these galaxies are more
<BR>
massive than can be accounted for by visible objects.  (Or at least, by our
<BR>
estimates of the mass of those visible objects.)
<BR>
<P>2) Gravitational lensing.  The new studies pointed to by Robert Bradbury's
<BR>
mail shows that there is a large gravitational lensing affect around nearby
<BR>
galaxies consistent with a much larger mass than can be accounted for by
<BR>
visible objects.  That is to say, the gravity of these galaxies is bending
<BR>
light at a level consistent with a much higher mass for the galaxy than we'd
<BR>
expect.  These studies also demonstrate how far from the galaxy the
<BR>
gravitational lensing effect extends, thus providing an estimate of the size
<BR>
of the &quot;halo&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>All of this having been said, the evidence is for missing mass, not missing
<BR>
matter.  As the &quot;dark energy&quot; article in New Scientist points out, mass can
<BR>
be accounted for by either matter or energy.
