<P>N.VA. BILLIONAIRE ENVISIONS CYBER-U
<BR>
High-tech billionaire Michael Saylor tomorrow will announce his
<BR>
$100 million donation for the development of a cyber university
<BR>
featuring lectures from the world's &quot;geniuses and leaders.&quot; 
<BR>
The nonprofit university would provide an &quot;Ivy League-quality&quot;
<BR>
education free of charge to anyone in the world, says Saylor, CEO
<BR>
of software firm MicroStrategy.  Saylor plans to donate more
<BR>
money to the effort as it progresses, and he says other
<BR>
philanthropists might contribute as well.  In the next several
<BR>
months Saylor plans to start building a studio in the Washington
<BR>
area where lectures will be videotaped.  Saylor's goal is to
<BR>
build the university into &quot;a cyber Library of Congress.&quot;
<BR>
Currently the online university lacks structure, staff, and
<BR>
specific curriculum, and observers are waiting to see whether the
<BR>
university will meet Saylor's large expectations. Endorsements
<BR>
from legislators and educators will be announced in coming weeks,
<BR>
Saylor says.  Saylor says he has already spoken with Congress
<BR>
members about providing federal grants for students to buy the
<BR>
hardware and software they would need to take courses at the
<BR>
school. (Washington Post, 15 March 2000)

<BR>
<P>I find it interesting that this great social initiative is
<BR>
coming not from the democratically elected government of this
<BR>
wealthy nation, but from a private individual...
