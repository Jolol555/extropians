<EM>&gt; In 1946 Edward Teller's group realized that there is no theoretical

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there were hungry nanoassemblers squirrelled away within her borders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and so she was immediately dismantling her military.  Would an

<P>Which is not neccessarily a bad thing for people that want to leave
<BR>
other people alone, and for people that want to be left alone. Its the
<BR>
people who insist on meddling in others affairs that bitch about this
<BR>
sort of arrangement, because they don't like to have to live with the
<BR>
consequences of their actions (or not live, as the case may be). I'm
<BR>
perfectly happy having a MAD policy with nanotechnology, just as I was
<BR>
perfectly happy with that strategy for nuclear technology. Those few
<BR>
individuals who truly don't want to live unless they get to be the top
<BR>
dog are obviously a concern, but how many such people will ever make it
<BR>
to such positions in the first place. Such people tend to get eliminated
<BR>
pretty early on.
