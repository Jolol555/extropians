<P>
In the western spiral arm of our galaxy lies a star system and a planet
<BR>
occupied ages ago.  On one mountain of that planet there is a great
<BR>
structure, thousands of cubits tall.  It is constructed of sapphire and
<BR>
diamond, is self-repairing, and derives energy from both solar power and
<BR>
an internal power supply which we do not understand.
<BR>
<P>Each solar rotation, this vast mechanism emits a tick.  Each hundred
<BR>
rotations, it emits a gong.  Those who study the mechanism believe that
<BR>
every ten thousand rotations, a small mechanism will appear from a
<BR>
certain door and make a sound.  The last effect has not been observed in
<BR>
living memory, and the next occurrence is projected to be nearly eighty
<BR>
generations removed from those now living.  Xenoarcheologists say that
<BR>
the gong's period was longer than that species' lifespan, and that the
<BR>
unseen mechanism had a period longer than that species' entire recorded
<BR>
history.  The entire edifice was constructed only a few years before
<BR>
that race vanished forever to wherever ancient races go.
<BR>
<P>Philosophers across the galaxy have argued over the purpose of the
<BR>
Eternal Clock.  As with other artifacts such as the Diamond Book, the
<BR>
Circle of Time, the Oracle, and the Wandering Flame, consensus holds
<BR>
that the motive was not religious or superstitious in nature, but philosophical.
<BR>
<P>What principle the Eternal Clock was intended to embody is still a
<BR>
matter of great controversy.  But while arguments rage in the halls of
<BR>
philosophy, while young philosophers propose new theories and old
<BR>
philosophers defend the consensus, while competing positions strive
<BR>
until one gains the upper hand at last, while children are born and
<BR>
great-grandparents die, while intelligent races evolve and vanish, the
<BR>
Eternal Clock continues to tick.  And perhaps that is the message it is
<BR>
intended to convey.

<P>Usually, Internet-tycoon projects like the Clock of the Long Now make me
want to stand up and scream:  &quot;How on Earth can I be living in a world
where there are wealthy people creative enough and ambitious enough to
spend $40M on this, while Foresight is still struggling to support
itself?&quot;  It's not that I object to the Clock, understand; I think the
Clock should be built.  I don't object to the money; I think that if a
survey were to be taken of all the forty-million-dollar units spent in
the global economy, the Clock of the Long Now is definitely in the
99.99th percentile.  It's just that if the technowealthy are going to go
that far outside the usual round of uncreative charity and pointless
hedonism, why can't Foresight, or for that matter the Singularity
Institute, get funding on the same level?  Is there some reason why
building a timeless artifact encouraging everyone to slow down appeals
more to the psyche than constructing a greater-than-human intelligence,
or than nanotechnology and everything that goes with it?
<P>I may think that human history is due to end within the next twenty
years.  I may think that improving on the 100 meter/sec signal
propagation speed of the human neuron should make it possible to achieve
a million-to-one or trillion-to-one speedup in subjective time.  If it
ever comes time to nominate someone for the position of Arch-Nemesis of
the Long Now, I'm on the short list.
<P>Still, I like the Clock of the Long Now.  If there's a clause in the
Sysop instructions about protecting artifacts like the Great Pyramid or
the Declaration of Independence, I'd be the first to nominate the Clock
of the Long Now for addition to the set.  It's such a wonderful example
of life imitating science fiction, especially if we can use
nanotechnology to make the Clock really permanent.
<P>I'm not suggesting that building the Clock is morally wrong while little
children are starving in Africa.  I'm not asserting that building the
Clock is morally wrong while Foresight could use more funding.  I'm not
even saying that if we're going to spend $40M to encourage everyone to
slow down and take the long view, we might want to consider spending a
few bucks on preventing the destruction of the world.  I really do think
that all such arguments are specious, that the implicitly argued
tradeoffs don't exist, that humanity can easily afford to fund the Clock
*and* everything else.  I'm *proud* that my species has finally reached
the point where we can build mysterious artifacts with inscrutable
philosophical purposes - where we can build forty-million-dollar
artifacts of true philosophical and aesthetic beauty, not because we
have to, or because we're afraid of the dark, but because they're beautiful.
<P>But if we've reached that level, then there are a lot of other beautiful
things that, one would think, we would also be doing.  Constructing a
new mind free from hate, learning the philosophical applications of
evolutionary psychology to free ourselves from ourselves.  What is it,
in the mind or the meme, that enables people to deeply care about the
Clock of the Long Now, but doesn't enable people to care about the
prospect of greater-than-human intelligence?  Why?  Why?  Why?
