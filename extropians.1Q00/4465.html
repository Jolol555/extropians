<P><EM>&gt; Exactly how is this better than an online sale using money?  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computational requirements are much larger, the probability of there being a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible chain of trades is not especially high, it takes a lot more work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the part of the participants, and it is almost impossible for any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participant to know what he should be able to get out of any particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's my point,  a sufficiently designed system would require no work on the
<BR>
part of the participants - all complex matching would take place in the program.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This last point is an especially big problem for such systems.  There may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a few thousand sales of VWs in any given year, but the odds of any of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being traded for wheat are just about zero.  The number of possible trades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of dissimilar goods is so large that you will never accumulate a meaningful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history on any particular type of exchange, which means no one can tell what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their goods are worth.  The only way around this is to use some item as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common intermediary step - in which case you've just re-invented money.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's exactly my point!  Since a system is created that blurs the definition
<BR>
between traditional currency and complex barter, all traditional barriers are
<BR>
broken down.
<BR>
<P>So here is the question, does the IRS have the legal right to tax me if I trade
<BR>
my old bicycle for a tennis racket?  If the answer is no, then the system I
<BR>
envision will allow people to carry on the majority of economic activity tax
<BR>
free. Because in the end there is no difference between simple and complex
<BR>
trade.  If the answer is yes, then my system still eludes the IRS because all
<BR>
economic activity is hidden by pseudoanonymous identities and encrypted
<BR>
transactions conducted on offshore computer systems.
