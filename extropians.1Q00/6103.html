<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well the transparency I advocate is mutual, two-way, transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Meaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the individual would be no more subject to surveillance than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; government.  In fact my suggestion is &quot;power equivolent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the more power you have to meddle in others lives, the *more* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject to surveillance.  In this scheme, the President and members 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; congress would live in a virtual fish bowl and we the people would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to know virtually *everything* about their political, business and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; affairs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I share your enthusiasm for accountability for our elected and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appointed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;leaders, however your proposal that they have more surveillance than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;average person runs counter to every security protocol of any leader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;security detail that ever kept its subject alive for more than 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not really.  In fact this sort of power-proportional transparency is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in effect in some ways.  Right now we can know much more about President
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Clinton than he could ever know about you.  I know where and when he 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;travels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; abroad.  I know why he has gone there and whom he talked to and what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; talked about.  If I wanted to I could, in a matter of minutes, find out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his agenda is for next week, where he'll be and what he'll be doing.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact its probably fair to say that Clinton is the *most* surveilled 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the planet, as it should be.  And he has been kept alive by his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; detail for a little more than 5 minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What he does in public is immaterial. Your proposal would have everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;knowing how he takes a crap, what he says to his little cover-up team
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;members, you will be able to catch him when he or his men are destroying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evidence or porking their interns...
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  Is any of that going to make you able to assasinate him?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When we have gotten past national sovereignty and moved on to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; democratic global governance, there will be no need for such things 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secrets and national security.  At that point we will only be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concerned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) individual security and (2) global security.  Both of those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security would best be served by ubiquitous transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;formation of other corporate structures as well...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rights?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Its pretty obvious you don't see the holes in your own argument. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is no government, then there is nothing illegal about corporations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amassing their own armies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its pretty obvious you aren't paying attention.  I do not advocate anarchy.  
<BR>
Just because there are no more *national* governments does not mean there 
<BR>
would be an global governmental vacuum.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In fact, your point is bogus, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporations CAN amass their own armies right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong.  Remember Waco?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Corporations can buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any weapon manufactured right now except nukes, and they don't need an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ATF background check, and they don't pay a $200.00 transfer tax.
</EM><BR>
<P>Buying a gun is a far cry from amassing an army.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Since the powerful will have greater computational resources, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;be able to make better use of the intelligence value of this ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;surveillance, so even if everyone has the same 'access' (or even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;powerful have 'less' access, they will still make better use of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and will be able to oppress people more as a result. Surveillance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;merely an intelligence gathering channel. Its value is directly related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to how much you can process in a given amount of time, and how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;useless data you can filter out. Unless you are going to mandate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;everyone have exactly the same amount of computing power, no more, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;less, then your scheme cannot work as you envision it, and it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;become a tool of repression for the powerful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once again, not really.  It doesn't take much computing power at all to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; browse an efficiently designed and frequently updated database.  Each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; citizen would not have to bear the onerous burden of creating and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maintaining their own database.  The database would be publicly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maintained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (of course under the glare of a great deal of transparency).  When I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the info, I'd just cruise on over to the database, log in and have a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around.  Not much different than what happens now when you go to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;google.com.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I would not have much advantage using a 1ghz Pentium III over somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using a 66mhz 486 in browsing such a database.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You obviously do not comprehend the scope of the problem at hand. We are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;talking the ability to monitor and filter the input of MILLIONS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras, giving real=time output of deeds being done. The computer that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can do that has not been built yet, and when it is YOU won't the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person to get one, it will be the government and the big corporations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, with feeling this time:  Just because the googobs of data are 
<BR>
available doesn't mean it would make sense for you to try to keep tabs on 
<BR>
all of it.  The data that effects *you* could be automatically sent to you 
<BR>
in the form of e-mail or an automated telephone call.  Something like:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Good morning Mr. Lorrey.  Last night at 11:18 p.m. Zero Powers accessed 
<BR>
your address, telephone number and social security number.  If you would 
<BR>
like his address, telephone number and social security number press 1.  If 
<BR>
you would like to be notified when and how he makes use of your data press 
<BR>
2.  If you would like a summary of his every move today e-mailed to you 
<BR>
press 3.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Viola!  You don't even need a computer, much less a very powerful one.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
