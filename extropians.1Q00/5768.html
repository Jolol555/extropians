<P>Quantum computers can be described by Quantum Turing Machines which are an 
<BR>
extension of Probabalistic Turing Machines, which are themselves an 
<BR>
extension of Universal Turing Machines. Any one of these machines can be 
<BR>
used to simulate any other, albeit at a potentially exponential slowdown.
<BR>
There are results that show that there are problems such that the slowest 
<BR>
quantum computer can solve them faster than the fastest classical 
<BR>
computer, but this is essentially just a proof that for any K, there is a 
<BR>
value X such that e^X is greater than XK. The reason that you haven't seen 
<BR>
many papers about this is that they predate the web, but lately a few of 
<BR>
the foundational papers have been put on line. Check out:

Feynman's seminal paper in which he argues that quantum physics cannot be
modeled efficiently on classical computers, and that quantum computers 
will do a better job in this respect. As far as I know, this is the first 
ever mention of quantum computers.

The first description and discussion of the Quantum Turing Machine, and reformulation
of the Church-Turing thesis. Quantum parallelism is discussed too.

<P>&gt; Nano-assembly can build anything that can be assembled (a different problem
&gt; from computed).  The current problem with quantum computers is that you
&gt; need a bench full of equipment to get a couple of qubits.  Nanoassembly
&gt; might shrink this somewhat but how much remains very unclear.
<P>There has been some good work done recently in Solid-State quantum gates, 
which seem to indicate that qubits will be able to be made on a scale 
similar to that for wafer fabrication. There are huge technological 
hurdles to be overcome first, but these result are promising:
