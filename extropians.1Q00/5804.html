<EM>&gt; scientific knowledge. Even in the year 2100 a re-entering 17 ton non-radioactive

<P>Nah, I have to admit I see their logic on this one.  It's not acceptable
<BR>
for *them* to decide to make *someone else* run a 1:1000 risk of death
<BR>
in 100 years, even for a reason as important as scientific knowledge. 
<BR>
NASA doesn't know from Singularity; for all they know, in 100 years
<BR>
those damn bureaucrats will have given up space travel and carpeted the
<BR>
Earth with delicately balanced arcologies.  I don't know whether the
<BR>
thought flashed through their minds; however, responsible space travel
<BR>
as practiced circa 2000 dictates that if you orbit it, you're
<BR>
responsible for de-orbiting it safely.  If NASA wanted the data, they
<BR>
were responsible for putting up a satellite where losing one gyroscope
<BR>
forces the decision to de-orbit it.
<BR>
<P>It's not that the 1:1000 risk is unacceptable; it's that it's a risk
<BR>
which is neither traditional nor unavoidable.  We accept what are
<BR>
technically 1:1000 risks as &quot;trivial&quot; if the result is viewed as a
<BR>
&quot;special case&quot;, i.e., something *unexpected* happened.  NASA's 1:1000
<BR>
chance is a *known* 1:1000 chance and is therefore regarded as
<BR>
unacceptable due to the way the human mind processes risks.
