I happen to think that it is a good idea to grant some basic rights to 
<BR>
infants, more to adults, none to early fetuses, insects, and microbes, and 
<BR>
very few to late-term fetuses and to some non-human animals.
<BR>
(end of reproduction)
<BR>
<P>Isn't a late-term fetus (last trimester) to be honest a... baby?  Semantics 
<BR>
are used to make something appear not so human and so more easily disposed 
<BR>
of.
<BR>
<P>I remember reading about a controversial philosophy professor who has put 
<BR>
forward the idea that children up to a certain time after birth should be 
<BR>
under &quot;probation&quot; as to whether or not they are allowed to live by the 
<BR>
parents.  There have been protests at the college that recently hired him to 
<BR>
try to kick him out.
<BR>
<P>Of course ancient cultures like the Spartans and also I believe the Vikings 
<BR>
did this.  But they were warrior societies that wanted only the fit to 
<BR>
survive to produce the best fighters and parents.
