<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;                                         - Robert Frost  (l923)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You have to have lived through a New Hampshire winter, comparable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what the winters were like back then (this one started off pretty good),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to understand his perspective. In the year Frost penned that, three dams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and several bridges on the Connecticutt River here in NH were wiped out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by ice floes. The 'wintah' of '78 was a good one as well. Its why the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Army's CRREL (Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory) Center
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is based about six miles away from me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very informative, Mike.  But what really pleases me is the mere FACT that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are having a conversation and not ONLY a difference of opinion about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an &quot;issue&quot; which is entirely too complex for facile generalization and where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotional factors probably play a larger role in forming convictions than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purely logical considerations -- and I DO include myself in this class.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The way I try to suppress the emotional component is to focus on pre-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vention rather than causation.  I received a letter from a friend informing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me that I ought to carefully consider the results of the Australian scheme.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am doing that.  I only mention this because I want you to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have NO FINAL VIEWPOINT on this subject.  In fact, I'm a bit of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know-nothing here -- I'm prepared to go with whatever works when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the problems we are trying to solve one by one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean this quite radically; if we discovered good reasons to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the free distribution of 410 riot shotguns, or 410s to the ladies and 12
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gauges to the gentlemen, by the government to every household in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; United States, with the National Rifle Association providing the required
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; educational services, I would support a pilot project to this effect both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectually and by a financial contribution if necessary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I appreciate your open mindedness then. I suggest you read Prof. John
<BR>
Lott's book, _More Guns, Less Crime_. You will likely find 'good
<BR>
reasons' there.
