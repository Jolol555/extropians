I liked the rhythms and sounds and compressed density of some verse).

`Images' -- like,like, um, like... *pictures*, you mean? Those words about 
<BR>
rain and roses and swaying daffies and running lions and gold light glinting 
<BR>
from the blade *make pictures in your head*??? Holy shit, I want my money 
<BR>
back!  Damien the deprived

<BR>
<P>If I really get into a novel I can envision things so well sometimes I feel 
<BR>
like I am seeing a film in my mind.  But this level of imagination is not 
<BR>
always consistant with me.  I wish I could connect to a vcr and record the 
<BR>
images and sounds!  Perhaps one day this will be a valued talent when such a 
<BR>
machine exists.
<BR>
<P>I feel for you having a problem with envisioning a scene that you are 
<BR>
writing about in a work of fiction.  That must be terribly hard.  I will 
<BR>
have to read some of your work to see how you have fared.
<BR>
<P>I loved your comment about wanting your money back! lol  Meatloaf(an 
<BR>
american rock singer not a disliked main course for dinner) has a great song 
<BR>
called, &quot;Life is a lemon and I want my money back!&quot;  Try to find it on MP3 
<BR>
if you can.
<BR>
<P>My brain and body has enough limitations that if I could I would probably 
<BR>
sue Heavenly Father or Gaia if it were possible.  Maybe that is why divinity 
<BR>
keeps a low profile!! lol

I guess you could call it occasional spontaneous eideticism... *sighs* wish 
<BR>
I had it all the time.

<BR>
<P>I have the same thing happen to me.  Conversations or events that held no 
<BR>
strong emotional or functional reason to be remembered and yet I do.  I hope 
<BR>
I don't come out of cryosuspension to only remember such things!
<BR>
<P>I guess that if there were something to this quantum evolutionary theory we 
<BR>
would not be so challenged! lol  I do look forward to being upgraded in the 
<BR>
future so I can have a unimpeded mind and body which I surely don't have 
<BR>
now.  Having no sense of direction or one that lies to me is so tiring.  My 
<BR>
memory and ability to learn is like sculpting by hand with not fresh clay 
<BR>
but the stuff left out for a couple of days.  And to think engineers run in 
<BR>
the family!
<BR>
