<EM>&gt; This is a scary future scenario!  And to help 'salve' human egos would the

<EM>&gt; Very disturbing!  I would hope with the wave of technological progress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coming we will be able to see much more then 10% of the global population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live a comfortable life.  And by 2040 won't the singularity wave or spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have hit and transformed the global society (adequate shelter, food and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medicine) with nanotech and AI?

<P>Yes, I don't buy into all of the class warfare crap the socialists 
<BR>
always bring up. Contrary to claims, using the measurement of the 
<BR>
same standard of living and/or poverty levels used in 1950, there 
<BR>
are fewer people in poverty than ever in human history. The reason 
<BR>
you see claims that there are MORE people 'in poverty' is that they 
<BR>
keep upping the bar of what a person living in 'povery' should be able 
<BR>
to have as a standard of living. I don't consider someone who has a 
<BR>
car, a VCR, a TV w/ digital cable, a stereo, cellular phone, pager, 
<BR>
and can afford a couple cartons of smokes and/or several cases of 
<BR>
beer each week, along with some recreational drugs, living quarters 
<BR>
of over 500 square feet per person, and an average diet of over 3000 
<BR>
calories a day to be living in poverty.
