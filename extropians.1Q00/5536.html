</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip, snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would further say that the same can be said of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;societies. This is pretty obvious, so I won't go into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much detail, but it is natural to have in societies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who disagree on various subjects. An analogy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be drawn between debates that occur in societies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and internal debates in a person's mind. It would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pretty scary to have a large society that agrees 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all of the time; in fact, we would simply not believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it, and see claims for such unanimity as a sign of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;false government propaganda.
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember reading a quote (can't recall who its attributed to):
<BR>
&quot;If everybody is thinking alike, somebody isn't thinking.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&lt;more snipping&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As a hypothetical example, imagine a person confronted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by the opinions of , oh, let's say an &quot;anarchist&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinions which he/she thinks are silly and wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Before responding, the person could think to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;himself/herself like this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Anarchists&quot;, he/she thinks, &quot;are just extreme kinds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of libertarians. They are foolish because they espouse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the impossible, but so what? What's the harm? No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society will ever actually BE an anarchy; there is too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much benefit to be gained from organizing good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;governmental systems. If 'anarchies' were superior,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they would already exist; their very absence is proof
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they are obviously inferior in an evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm.  Do I respond to this?  I mean after all its only the hypothetical 
<BR>
internal dialogue of a hypothetical person.  Oh well, its lunchtime and I've 
<BR>
got nothing else to do right now, so here goes...
<BR>
<P>Simply because something has never been, does not mean it never will be.  
<BR>
Think constitutional democracy or universal enfranchisement or human flight 
<BR>
circa 1700 a.d.  Think nanotechnology or universal properity circa 2000 a.d.
<BR>
<P>At one time people thought that no regime would be so tyrannical as to 
<BR>
exterminate its minority populations.  This is the main reason that, in the 
<BR>
early 1930's, no one really reacted to the Nazi party despite its extremely 
<BR>
xenophobic rhetoric, even while Nazi military aggression was steadily 
<BR>
increasing.  Now, thanks to der Fuhrer, we realize that humanity is in fact 
<BR>
capable of some incredibly vicious behavior.  That is the reason why the 
<BR>
ascendancy of the Freedom Party in Austria has raised such an international 
<BR>
ruckus, even though their rhetoric and policies are down right warm and 
<BR>
fuzzy when compared with Hilter.
<BR>
<P>A better reason for your hypothetical person to ignore the rantings of an 
<BR>
avowed anarchist is because (a) true anarchists are in the extreme minority 
<BR>
and (b) its not even a very active or vocal minority.  On the other hand, if 
<BR>
say 1-5% of the population were to advocate true anarchy and they were 
<BR>
actively and vocally working toward it, you would have very good reason to 
<BR>
become concerned, regardless of the obvious problems with anarchic 
<BR>
philosophy or the fact that anarchy has not taken hold in the past.
<BR>
<P>All that having (perhaps unnecessarily) been said, I whole-heartedly agree 
<BR>
with what you say about the value of extremism.  Without extremists there 
<BR>
would never be revolution, only evolution.  And history has shown than 
<BR>
revolution, often, is a good thing.  Think where we might be without such 
<BR>
extremists as Socrates, Jesus, Thomas Paine, Albert Einstein, Mohandas 
<BR>
Ghandi, Martin L. King, Jr., and K. Eric Drexler.  The next time someone 
<BR>
accuses you of being an extremist, you might think of these folks and take 
<BR>
it as a compliment.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
