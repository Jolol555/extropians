<P><EM>&gt;I guess I'm &quot;not getting it&quot;..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One molecule of gas....it absorbs energy.......then what?
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember, energy comes in chunks. So, one molecule of gas is slammed into 
<BR>
by a photon moving at lightspeed, and absorbs it. This gives the molecule 
<BR>
a kick in the direction that the photon was moving. How much the molecule 
<BR>
speeds up, and exactly how it moves depends strongly on the energy 
<BR>
(frequency) of the photon, the shape of the molecule and what part 
<BR>
absorbed the photon. Now, not only will the molecule be moving faster, but 
<BR>
it will be in an energized (excited) state, and will at some point in the 
<BR>
near future fire off a photon in some (usually random) direction, so that 
<BR>
it can return to its normal state. Of course, when it fires off a photon, 
<BR>
it recoils and slows down, changing direction as it does. 
<BR>
<P>Now if this is happening in a gas, where molecules are common, the photon 
<BR>
that was just fired off isn't going to get very far before it hits some 
<BR>
other molecule and is absorbed. You can easily imagine that even in a 
<BR>
really cold gas that has only one photon to bat back and forth, the 
<BR>
molecules are going to keep absorbing and firing off the photon and moving 
<BR>
further apart from each other, until they are finally far enough apart 
<BR>
that the photon doesn't hit anything, and escapes.
<BR>
<P>This is the physics behind Boyle's law, that relates presure (P), 
<BR>
temperature (T) and volume (V) in a gas. PV=kT, where k is a constant that 
<BR>
depends on the gas.
