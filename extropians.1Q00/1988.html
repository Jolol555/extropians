<EM>&gt; &gt; The ultimate problem with solar power is that there isn't enough of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've seen projections in which the planet's power needs by 2050 will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such that a band of 100% efficient solar cells 10 miles wide and wrapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the whole equator will not give enough power. So, even if we converted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all highways and all roofing materials to 98% efficient solar cells,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we're *still* going to have to go out and find other fuel sources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, my comment would be -- *never* believe everything you read.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I said at Extro3 -- &quot;Trust but verify&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Draging up an Excel sheet (I just love Excel...),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Earth's Circumference: 6378 km x 10 mi, gives about 2*10^9 km^2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Assume perhaps 30% of it is getting sunlight at a rate of about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  750 w/m^2 that is being harvested at an efficiency of about 20%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (after all if we are enginering for planetary power we can afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the &quot;good&quot; solar cells...).  That gives you ~10^10 W (J/sec).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Assuming maybe 8 hours of light per day gives you an annual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  production of ~1000 EJ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to &quot;Energy: A Guidebook&quot;, in 1974, our annual energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumption was 370 EJ (year round constant drain of 12 TW).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So even with some pretty pessimistic assumptions we should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to harvest 2-3x the amount of energy we are currently consuming.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, so the numbers are more or less as I assumed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, I think there are some interesting built-in assumptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in your claim, like:
</EM><BR>
<P>As always.  And note that this is not *my* claim, just something I read a while 
<BR>
ago, and thought worth repeating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (a) You can't put power collectors in the ocean...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       Yet here in Washington State we have several &quot;floating&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       bridges...
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would such an assumption be required? I just implied that 10^9 km^2 isn't 
<BR>
enough. Your numbers aren't that far off considering I was pulling numbers out 
<BR>
of a rather leaky memory...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (b) That power consumption will continue to grow at past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       historic rates...  But in the developed countries per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       capita power consumption seems to have leveled off...
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted. Still, I have a feeling that that will be compensated for by the sheer 
<BR>
number of third-world countries that enter the computer age in the next few 
<BR>
decades.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (c) That there will be no improvements in energy efficiencies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       (automobiles, electric lights, etc.)  [LEDs for example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       are 50%+ efficient, new electrodeless sodium vapor lamps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       are 2-3x as efficient as incandescent.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup. Oh, I think the *technology* will improve, but I'm not forcasting the 
<BR>
arrival of *commercially viable* new  technology. There just doesn't seem to be 
<BR>
enough demand (sad to say) to cause the improvements in cost per unit that will 
<BR>
be sufficient to convince people to switch to alternative methods. I'd love to 
<BR>
be proved wrong on this point, BTW.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (d) The solar cells are the really crappy 8% efficient versions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       rather than the 30+% efficient versions that we can build...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm.  I think that was most likely part of the assumption. Then again, what's 
<BR>
the current per-capita cost of 10^9 km^2 of the expensive kind of solar cell...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   (e) That we don't use other more efficient technologies such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       as heliostats and heat pumps to harvest the solar power...
</EM><BR>
<P>These devices tend to be more expensive and require more maintenance, no? Are 
<BR>
they really cheaper when the energy cost of their manufacture and maintenace 
<BR>
are factored in?  My guess is yes, but not by the margin you believe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But we are talking 50 years here.  Everyone always assumes the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing when discussing these limits -- the population grows, energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumption grows and technology stands still.  Makes me want to gag.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted. My point was just that there just isn't as much solar energy reaching 
<BR>
the planet as some people seem to think.  Putting a solar cell on top of every 
<BR>
car won't suffice. Neither will paving all our roads and rooftops with solar 
<BR>
cells.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And 10 miles wide is nothing, we've got agriculture production over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of the land area of the Northern hemisphere hundreds to thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of miles wide!  I've previously discussed how terribly poor our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agricultural efficiencies are. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't get me started on the ecological wasteland that USED to be praries in 
<BR>
North America and is now monocultural bio-factories for as far as the eye can 
<BR>
see. Slightly more picturesque than the smokestacks of New Jersey, but no 
<BR>
better for the ecology of the region...  One of the things *I've* been hoping 
<BR>
that nanotech would give us is a food production system efficient enough to let 
<BR>
most of the grain belt be returned to its natural state.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; (Note that I'm assuming we don't get around to huge solar collectors in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; space. THAT way we could get enough power for the planet.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  Though the power delivery area requirements remain a concern.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ever since I've heard about the plans to use phase conjugation systems to steer 
<BR>
the energy beams, I'm far more comfortable with the idea of giant power beams 
<BR>
being aimed at the hearts of our cities...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, if we get to the point of building interesting diamondoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things out of oil, I can see the carbon supplies going rapidly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But by then it will be a very different economy, so it really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno there is one heck of a *lot* of carbon on the planet, not just as oil.
