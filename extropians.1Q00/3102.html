Some interesting papers I found in my piles this week:
<BR>
<P>* RNA and DNA computing
<BR>
* Asteroid defense
<BR>
* Mesicopters
<BR>
* Information theory limits control
<BR>
* Self-assembling computations
<BR>
* Future psychology
<BR>
* Irish coffee against brain damage?
<BR>
* Ageing in yeast, worms and humans - same system?
<BR>
* Do we live long because we are smart?
<BR>
<P><P>Molecular computation: RNA solutions to chess problems by Dirk
<BR>
Faulhammer, Anthony R. Cukras, Richard J. Lipton and Laura F. Landweber 
<BR>
in PNAS, 97:4 1385-1389 2000
<BR>
<P>We have already seen DNA computers solve problems, but this is the
<BR>
first RNA computer I have seen. They solve the problem of placing
<BR>
knights on a chessboard so that none are threatening each other by
<BR>
creating a mixture of RNA strings encoding all possible states,
<BR>
digesting all the illegal ones using ribonukleases and then reading
<BR>
out the winning sequences. Still a fairly small problem, but nice
<BR>
nevertheless.
<BR>
<P><P>DNA computing on surfaces by Quingha Liu, Liman Wang, Anthony
<BR>
G. Frutos, Anne E. Condon, Robert M. Corn and Lloyd M. Smith, Nature
<BR>
403 175--179 2000
<BR>
<P>Another DNA computing paper, this time using DNA strings attached to a
<BR>
support to solve an instance of the satisfiability problem. This is
<BR>
likely a more scaleable method than the usual wet approach.
<BR>
<P><P><P>SHIELD: A Comprehensive Earth Protection System by Robert E. Gold, A
<BR>
Phase I Report to NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts
<BR>
<A HREF="http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/files/9801/9801Final/GoldFinal.pdf">http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/files/9801/9801Final/GoldFinal.pdf</A>
<BR>
<P>A report about what would be needed for an Earth defence system
<BR>
against asteroids and comets. Contains a nice review of the threats,
<BR>
ways of averting threats and estimates of what such a system would
<BR>
need to be able to do. Gold suggests a system containing sentry
<BR>
satelites in solar orbit at the distance of Venus to catalogue NEOs,
<BR>
and an early warning system at Jupiter orbit for detecting long
<BR>
periodic comets. As for the active defense, the &quot;soldiers&quot;, he discuss
<BR>
kinetic impact, nuclear detonation and various propulsion methods to
<BR>
redirect the threat in time. Overall, a cautious and readable paper.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Mesicopter: A Meso-Scale Flight Vehicle, NIAC Phase I Final Report
<BR>
<A HREF="http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/files/9801/9801Final/KrooFinal.pdf">http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/files/9801/9801Final/KrooFinal.pdf</A>
<BR>
<P>The results of a program researching flying vehicles on the centimeter
<BR>
scale. They have developed and built an externally powered
<BR>
&quot;mesicopter&quot; with 4 rotors with 1.5 cm diameters, which was able to
<BR>
lift over 700 mg (more than enough to support the 325 mg motor-rotor
<BR>
assembly). Current work involve free flight tests and onboard
<BR>
lightweight batteries (for missions lasting tens of minutes). A lot of
<BR>
aerodynamics I don't understand well, but a cool little device which
<BR>
could likely be a great basis for swarm systems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Information theoretic limits of control, by Hugo Touchette and Seth
<BR>
Lloyd, Physical Rev. Letters vol 84:6 2000 1156--1159
<BR>
<P>A nice little analysis of controllability of physical systems based on
<BR>
information theory. The second law of thermodynamics places limits to
<BR>
how little dissipation we can get when using open-loop control. Also,
<BR>
feedback control is a kind of zero sum game, where each bit of
<BR>
information a controller gets from a system can at most be used to
<BR>
decrease the entropy of the system with one bit.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Using lateral capillary forces to compute by self-assembly, by Paul
<BR>
W. K. Rothemund, PNAS 97:3 984--989
<BR>
<P>It is possible to create sets of tiles that are computationally
<BR>
universal; if they are used to tile a plane the edges force the tiling
<BR>
to act as a computing device. Rothemund has explored self-assembling
<BR>
computation using acrylic tiles with hydrophobic or hydrophilic edges,
<BR>
coding tiles generating checkerboard patterns, penrose tiles or the
<BR>
XOR cellular automaton. It turns out that they gladly self assemble,
<BR>
but you get defects of various kinds; the amount of defects seem to
<BR>
hinge on the tiling rule. Still far from any useful computation, but
<BR>
self assembly is a very young field.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Looking back: The History of Psychiatry in the 21st Century, by Robert
<BR>
Michels, Arch Gen Psychiatry Vol 56 Dec 1999
<BR>
<P>A fictional paper sugegsting one way psychiatry might change in this
<BR>
century. The basic idea is that widespread use of antenatal screening
<BR>
with DNA chips makes parents avoid selecting children with genes
<BR>
causing or predisposing psychatric disorders. The result is a world
<BR>
where they become very rare, and the only remaining mental illnesses
<BR>
are those caused by experiences or upbringing. Clinical psychiatry
<BR>
turns increasingly more towards the adjustment of personality, with
<BR>
personally customised treatments based on known genetic potentials and
<BR>
risks. Overall a very positive and transhumanist article.
<BR>
<P><P>Combination of low dose ethanol and caffeine protects brain from
<BR>
damage produced by focal ischemia in rats, by R. Strong, J.C. Grotta
<BR>
and J. Aronowski. Neuropharmacology 39 (2000) 515-522
<BR>
<P>This study studied the effects of the combination caffeine and alcohol
<BR>
on brain damage in rats. They found that caffeine alone, when given
<BR>
before ischemia, had no effect, and that alcohol alone actually
<BR>
worsened the damage. But the combination, given orally a few hours
<BR>
before the damage or injected within 120 minutes afterwards, decreased
<BR>
the brain damage significantly! Unfortunately, chronic daily caffine
<BR>
and ethanol consumption for a few weeks before the experiment removed
<BR>
these effects, so Irish coffee should only be drunk when you are close
<BR>
to ischemia in time. Hmm... almost sounds like a nice sendoff ceremony
<BR>
for would-be cryonauts :-)
<BR>
<P><P><P>Brains, Maturation times and Parenting, by John Allman and Andrea
<BR>
Hasenstaub, Neurobiology of Aging 20 (1999) 447-454
<BR>
<P>Why does it take so long for humans to grow up, and why do we age so
<BR>
slowly compared to other primates? One explanation could be that we
<BR>
need a long maturation period to develop our complex brains (since
<BR>
they need to interact with the environment to develop, and this cannot
<BR>
be speeded), and this in turn has favored the development of genes
<BR>
that slow brain senescence. This article analyses the time and costs
<BR>
for brain development, and compares relative brain size to development
<BR>
time for various species. They also look at other parenting factors
<BR>
for longevity, such as the relative male-female survival as a function
<BR>
of how much parenting they do in different species. All in all, this
<BR>
article suggests that the reason we live so long even without
<BR>
technology is that we need the cultural transmission and memory of
<BR>
parents and grandparents, whose skills help their children and
<BR>
grandchildren survive.
<BR>
<P><P>Mutations in signal transduction proteins increase the stress
<BR>
resistance and longevity in yeast, nematodes, fruit flies and
<BR>
mammalian neuronal cells, by Valter D. Longo in Neurobiology of Aging
<BR>
20 (1999) 479-486.
<BR>
<P>A review of proteins involved in extending the lifespan of yeast
<BR>
cells, and how they relate to proteins known to affect longevity in
<BR>
C. elegans and drosophilia. The article discuss how these proteins
<BR>
relate to stress resistance, antioxidant activity and ageing, and
<BR>
suggests that the same mechanisms go for many eucaryotes.
