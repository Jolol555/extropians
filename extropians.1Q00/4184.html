<EM>&gt; I want my Moller skycar!  Dr. Moller says that the average insurance rate

<EM>&gt; would drop to about $20 if his aircars were in general use and using the air

<EM>&gt; traffic control system he recommends.

<P>Sorry to rain or your parade John but speaking as a former pilot, I gotta say
<BR>
Dr. Moller is out of his tree! Even if you take into account the future
<BR>
possibilty of virtual highways in the sky rendered on your heads up display you
<BR>
still have a myriad things that can go wrong. The first time one of his flying
<BR>
cars falls out of the sky onto a downtown street or into the side of an office
<BR>
building due to some maintence issue possibly neglected by Mr. Public, you will
<BR>
have insurance companies screaming blood murder!
<BR>
<P>This assumes his flying car will indeed fly. I've seen it and it looks dubious
<BR>
to me. The skies around airports are already insanely crowded. It's pretty to
<BR>
dream about but we must practically consider if we really want the same
<BR>
congestion on our streets to migrate to the skies above those streets. What
<BR>
would drop insurance rates would be giving up our individual cars in favor of
<BR>
more mass transit. Perhaps call to order driverless vehicles that come to your
<BR>
door step, travel a ways and join up with a mass of others going the same
<BR>
direction, then branch off to your destination where other passengers take that
<BR>
same vehicle to yet another destination.
