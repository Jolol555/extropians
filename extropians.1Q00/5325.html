<EM>&gt; For those of you who didn't catch it, the January 2K issue of Scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American had an interesting article on &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html</A>

<EM>&gt; The snowball earth events where the CO2 recycler got jammed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continents clustering around the equator (maybe), causing the earth to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through freezings (-50C) followed by heat waves (+50C) lasting tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; millions of years.  During the ice periods all of the continents and oceans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been buried in several km of ice.  There is no evaporation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the oceans covered in ice and even if they weren't, the cold would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce low evaporation rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>The more I hear about these catastrophic behavior patterns of the earth,
<BR>
the less I hear about James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis.  His idea was
<BR>
that the earth was a single, global super-organism, which regulated its
<BR>
own temperature and &quot;internal&quot; environment just like other organisms.
<BR>
This is why the earth has been so &quot;mild&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now that it appears that earth may not have always been so congenial,
<BR>
it makes Lovelock's already-tenuous hypothesis look even more unlikely.
<BR>
<P>The big problem I always had with the Gaia idea is that organisms can
<BR>
control their internal environmens only because they have evolved this
<BR>
ability over many generations.  Early organisms were probably bad at it,
<BR>
but those which were slightly better survived and reproduced, and over
<BR>
time the ability improved.
<BR>
<P>I don't see any way such a mechanism can operate at the level of the
<BR>
single global super-organism, if we choose to look at life that way.
<BR>
It is a single immortal living entity; it does not reproduce, it
<BR>
does not compete with other organisms, hence it cannot evolve in
<BR>
the Darwinian sense.  An incompetent Gaia simply dies.  A successful
<BR>
one lives until something happens that it can't handle, then it dies.
<BR>
There are no progeny to carry on the genes, no sources of variation and
<BR>
selection to evolve ever more successful generations of Gaia organisms.
<BR>
<P>Of course some people choose to interpret out own technologies as
<BR>
developing Gaia's reproductive organs, our eventual interplanetary
<BR>
colonization efforts being Gaia's production of ova and sperm to go out
<BR>
and fertilize the universe.  Even if this view has some validity, it
<BR>
doesn't shed any light on why or how Gaia has survived as long as she has.
<BR>
<P>I find myself leaning towards the view that we simply got very,
<BR>
very lucky.  Life's survival on earth was an incredible fluke, a one
<BR>
in a trillion chance.  Most planets kill off their life before it gets
<BR>
this far.  It's an optimistic approach, explaining the Fermi paradox by
<BR>
putting most of Robin Hanson's &quot;great filter&quot; behind us.
