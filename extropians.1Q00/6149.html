<BR>
<EM>&gt; In summary.  This system is very useless without a lot of data-crunching,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because otherwise, you don't know where to look.  The more data-crunching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can do, the more useful your system is to me.  The more powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am, the more data-crunching I can do.  So the more powerful I am, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more useful your system is to me.  So this system helps the powerful more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than it helps the weak.
</EM><BR>
<P>Furthermore, there's (usually) a difference between the sorts of threats
<BR>
people at different positions in a power structure might perceive.  The
<BR>
aforementioned &quot;despots&quot; - generalize this to anyone who has a high level
<BR>
of power and hence would be interesting to lots of people and therefore
<BR>
under scrutiny - is most threatened by individuals - assassins, subversives,
<BR>
whatever.  A system which tracks each &gt;individual&lt;'s actions would be
<BR>
most useful to this sort of person.
<BR>
<P>Leaving out Zero's &quot;sworn enemies&quot; list (I suspect that few people
<BR>
other than those despots would have such a thing), I think most of the things
<BR>
individuals would find threatening would be acts of &gt;organizations&lt;.
<BR>
As an individual, I might be interested in knowing that &quot;the police&quot;
<BR>
are asking about me, or that my employer is checking out my background,
<BR>
or that the legislature is about to pass a law which directly threatens
<BR>
my property or livelihood.   The database that would permit this
<BR>
kind of organizational surveillance would be structurally rather
<BR>
different than one tracking only individual-to-individual acts.  And
<BR>
lots of this organizational and relationship information would be
<BR>
necessary - it's not really interesting to me to know that Joe Blow scanned
<BR>
me while I was leaving my girlfriend's building, without the additional
<BR>
information that Joe Blow is a divorce attorney working on retainer to
<BR>
my wife.  That sort of thing.  Building and keeping that database
<BR>
accurate and up-to-date is IMO as monstrous a problem as the obvious
<BR>
visual/speech recognition problems would be for ubiquitous surveillance.
