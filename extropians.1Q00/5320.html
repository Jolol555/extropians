Lee Daniel Crocker says:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Patents don't cover ideas.  Any IP lawyer will tell you that.  Patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cover implementations.  There has to be an implementation, and *only*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that particular implemented technique is covered.  No fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; algorithms or ideas are covered. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, actually patents _do_ apply to the ideas as well.  Copyrights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't apply to ideas, just particular expressions of them--but that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not the case with patents.  If you patent a gadget, and someone else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uses your design to build a similar gadget using different materials
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and slight modifications, but still clearly based on your ideas, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is infringing under present law.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah.  You are correct, I misspoke.  What I was trying to get at is
<BR>
that in no sense do you &quot;own an idea&quot;.  What you get ownership of is
<BR>
the right to profit from a particular useful idea for a limited period
<BR>
of time.  This goes further in that there is some magic dividing line
<BR>
in the law between what's fundamental and therefore beyond coverage.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the point I was making is that the law doesn't recognize
<BR>
ownership of ideas, per se.
