Subject:  Another reason to burn your census form
<BR>
<P>I already tossed my census form in the garbage, but if I hadn't, this report
<BR>
certainly would make me do so.  Of course, reports like this are merely
<BR>
indicitive of our government in less enlightened, less progressive times.
<BR>
Nothing like this could ever happen now, right?

Census Bureau Role Reported in Internment of Japanese-Americans
<BR>
By STEVEN A. HOLMES
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON -- Two scholars say in a new research paper that despite earlier
<BR>
denials, the Census Bureau was deeply involved in the roundup and internment
<BR>
of Japanese-Americans at the onset of American entry into World War II.
<BR>
<P>The academics say the bureau's involvement included identifying
<BR>
concentrations of people of Japanese ancestry in geographic units as small
<BR>
as city blocks, lending a senior Census Bureau official to work with the War
<BR>
Department on the relocation program and a willingness to disclose names and
<BR>
addresses of Japanese-Americans.
<BR>
<P>While it is common today for the Census Bureau to publish reports that would
<BR>
detail the number of people of a given race living in an area as small as a
<BR>
city block, such information was generally not available in the 1940's. But
<BR>
the authors of the paper contend that the Census Bureau provided such
<BR>
detailed information as well as age, sex, citizenship and country of birth
<BR>
to the War Department, now the Defense Department, on only one group,
<BR>
Japanese-Americans.
<BR>
<P>The paper, &quot;After Pearl Harbor: The Proper Role of Population Data Systems
<BR>
in Time of War,&quot; was written by William Seltzer, a statistician and
<BR>
demographer at Fordham University, and Margo Anderson, a history professor
<BR>
at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee whose area of expertise is the
<BR>
census.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Seltzer and Professor Anderson plan to present the paper at the annual
<BR>
meeting of the Population Association of America next week in Los Angeles.
<BR>
Copies have been circulating in Washington, and one was made available to
<BR>
The New York Times.
<BR>
<P>The practices described in the paper did not appear to have violated laws
<BR>
governing the census, which prohibit the bureau from disclosing census
<BR>
information on individuals. But the authors indicated that despite the law,
<BR>
Census Bureau officials appeared to be willing to provide such data. What is
<BR>
not clear is whether they were asked to do so.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;We're by law required to keep confidential information by individuals,&quot; the
<BR>
paper quotes the bureau director, J. C. Capt, as saying at a meeting of the
<BR>
Census Advisory Committee in January 1942.
<BR>
<P>But if
<BR>
<P>the defense authorities found 200 Japanese-Americans missing and they wanted
<BR>
the names of the Japanese-Americans in that area, Mr. Capt said, &quot;I would
<BR>
give them further means of checking individuals.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Census Bureau often boasted that its conduct in the relocation of
<BR>
Japanese-Americans had been its finest hour because it resisted pressure to
<BR>
provide explicit data to the War and Justice Departments.
<BR>
<P>But bureau officials do not dispute the findings of the paper. They say,
<BR>
however, that the strengthening of the laws protecting the confidentiality
<BR>
of data on individuals and the environment today would make a repetition of
<BR>
those abuses unlikely.
<BR>
<P>Japanese-Americans have long suspected that the Census Bureau played a
<BR>
prominent role in the relocation of 120,000 residents of Japanese ancestry
<BR>
to detention camps.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;We've always suspected this,&quot; said Norman Mineta, a former California
<BR>
congressman who was removed with his family from San Jose and sent to a
<BR>
detention camp in Wyoming.
<BR>
<P>&quot;After all, they are the keeper of this kind of information.&quot;
<BR>
<P>On Dec. 9, 1941, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Census
<BR>
Bureau produced a report titled
<BR>
<P>&quot;Japanese Population of the United States, Its Territories and Possessions.&quot;
<BR>
The next day the bureau issued a report on the Japanese population by
<BR>
citizenship and place of birth in selected cities across the country. The
<BR>
next day it published another report, this one on the Japanese population by
<BR>
counties in states on the West Coast.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Capt justified the speed with which the bureau produced these reports by
<BR>
saying at meeting of the Census Advisory Committee in January 1942: &quot;We
<BR>
didn't want to wait for the declaration of war. On Monday morning we put our
<BR>
people to work on the Japanese thing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Subsequent reports became even more detailed.
<BR>
<P>In 1942, Tom Clark, a Justice Department official working with the War
<BR>
Department, was quoted in the paper as saying that Census Bureau officials
<BR>
would &quot;lay out on tables [maps of] various city blocks where Japanese lived
<BR>
and they would tell me how many were living in each block.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The paper's disclosures come at a ticklish time for the Census Bureau
<BR>
because they coincide with the mailing this month of census forms to about
<BR>
120 million households. Bureau officials say they fear that the scholars'
<BR>
paper may frighten people into not returning the forms.
<BR>
<P>--------------------------
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only dangerous idea is the idea that there
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are such things as dangerous ideas.
