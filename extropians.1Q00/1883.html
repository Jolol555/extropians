<EM>&gt; I'm not sure if I asked or if anyone ever responded to, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question of what a photon does when it strikes a neutron star
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remains an interesting question to me....  As does the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the &quot;lifetime&quot; of neutron stars.  While the neutrons in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; center may be constrained from decaying, I doubt the same is true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for neutrons on the surface.  That would suggest that neutron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stars should evaporate.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I thought most models of neutron stars assumed that they weren't solid
<BR>
neutronium all the way to the surface, but had a crust of degenerate
<BR>
matter of some thickness, and then a messy mantle with increasingly
<BR>
fewer protons and electrons the deeper you go. (I may be wrong, though.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The point here is that an MB that extends all the way down _into_ the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surface of a black dwarf has access to vastly more structured matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for computation purposes -- 10 to 1000 Jovian masses doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unreasonable -- and also doesn't suffer from the same sort of lightspeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; propagation lag as an MB with dimensions measured in AU's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You *always* have the lightspeed limit, but I agree that removing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; star at the center of an MBrain and replacing it with computronium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produces the highest density computing capacity.  The problem then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes how do you pump energy in and heat out?
</EM><BR>
<P>With a dynamo and some sort of momentum-transfer effect to the outer
<BR>
layers? (Remember, rotating neutron stars tend to have teensy-weensy
<BR>
magnetic fields -- that's why we can spot them tens of thousands of
<BR>
light-years away ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anders does discuss the computational rates of nuclear matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in his Neutronium brain and points out the problems of increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the matter density too much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For reference purposes a Matrioska Brain of my design probably falls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between Anders' Dyson brain &quot;Uranos&quot; and Neutronium Brain &quot;Chronos&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with an emphasis on power efficiency and heat removal (vis-a-vis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of the optimizations Anders makes).
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Any chance you could point me at some URLs for these? (Or paper refs?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, its worth noting that Xenology says the decay time of a muon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is 2.2 microseconds (at non-c speeds presumably) and you can do a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of computation in 2.2 mu-sec.  The problem is to develop a system that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regenerates the mu-matter as fast as it decays.
</EM><BR>
<P>What made me think of muons was an article in New Scientist about the
<BR>
use of muons as catalysts for &quot;cool&quot; fusion -- not the Fleischman-Pons
<BR>
thing, but a phenomenon that's been observed but which is unfortunately
<BR>
endothermic. (Basically, if you replace the electrons in deuterium
<BR>
atoms with muons you shrink the orbital to much that it's possible for
<BR>
quantum tunnelling between nuclei to occur, lowering the energy barrier
<BR>
to fusion; the problem is that each muon can at best catalyse only a 
<BR>
few dozen to hundreds of fusion events, there's a poisoning effect due
<BR>
to helium nuclei mopping up free muons, and muons are expensive to produce.
<BR>
But if we've got a muon production source on our neutron star, and can
<BR>
dump a bit of hydrogen onto it ...
