<P>I spent several hours studying the earlier Waco video a few months ago.
<BR>
I agree that, based on these photographs, a structure of some sort is
<BR>
present in the courtyard on the day of the fire, which was not there a
<BR>
few days ago.
<BR>
<P>However I question whether this would be a &quot;sniper's nest&quot; for a couple of
<BR>
reasons.  The main one is that this does not seem to be a very reasonable
<BR>
position for a sniper to hide.  It is in the courtyard, surrounded on
<BR>
three sides by buildings occupied by the people he would be sniping at.
<BR>
<P>It does not appear to be a very defensible position, as he could have
<BR>
bullets coming at him from three directions.  Further, he would himself
<BR>
be firing at virtually point-blank range.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Sniping&quot; usually connotes a somewhat long-distance firing activity.
<BR>
Placing your &quot;nest&quot; in the middle of the enemy's courtyard, mere yards
<BR>
from the walls, just seems utterly absurd.
<BR>
<P>I also think that the size and shape of the structure is not what I
<BR>
would expect for something like this, but I am not familiar with military
<BR>
equipment so I can't say for sure.
<BR>
<P>The only real evidence for calling it a sniper's nest is that flashes
<BR>
which could be gunshots were seen near it, and the object did not
<BR>
appear to be present a few days earlier.  However it could easily be
<BR>
some piece of junk the Davidians moved outside into their courtyard in
<BR>
the days preceding the final attack.  As for the flashes, they are seen
<BR>
in a number of locations besides the courtyard.
<BR>
