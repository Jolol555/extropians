Seriously, all of our extropian dreams, all of our fond hopes for indefinite 
<BR>
life extension, pretty much everything we now live for depends upon the very 
<BR>
difficult task of lifting the masses of humanity out of superstition and 
<BR>
tyranny, a morass from which extrication sometimes seems nearly impossible.  
<BR>
But somehow we must manage it, otherwise the masses will likely prevent our 
<BR>
dreams from becoming reality. I guess this is dynamic optimism, to believe 
<BR>
that humanity *will* emerge from darkness.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It is a sad thought that many will grow old faster then necessary and even 
<BR>
die (sometimes painful and slow death's from disease) because researchers 
<BR>
were slowed down or even stopped in their efforts to further science.
<BR>
<P>One thing to remember, though.  It is those who are already born to this 
<BR>
world who dwell on this so much!  I believe that Neal and Ariana's future 
<BR>
grandchildren will have it made! lol  We want to save our own butts first!
<BR>
<P>If there is a gift we can give future generations, it is the one of freedom. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We ourselves owe so much to the founding fathers who wrote the American 
<BR>
constitution and fought for it's implementation.  Now, there are those who 
<BR>
would (even in the name of law and order) strip away our rights, layer upon 
<BR>
layer.
<BR>
<P>We must leave a legacy of having fought the good fight to preserve our civil 
<BR>
liberties for not just this generation but future ones.  The scenario Spike 
<BR>
gave where cameras were everywhere and privacy was violated in a world of 
<BR>
plenty really alarmed me.  This would be a noble cause for the Extropy 
<BR>
Institute and it's membership to fight for.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
