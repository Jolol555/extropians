<EM>&gt; Ross,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just because a right to bear arms is declared by the Constitution, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bearing of arms is not necessarily right.  I'm not taking sides in the gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debate, all I am saying is that a governmental affirmation of something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't mean that that something is good, bad or wise.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, however based on the philosophical foundations that the founding fathers
<BR>
shared, that all men are born with inalienable rights (whether it be god, dog,
<BR>
nature, what have you that created those rights is irrelevant), the right of
<BR>
individuals to defend themselves was quite a commonplace assumption. Madison
<BR>
wondered why it was needed only because he could not fathom a society that would
<BR>
not take the right to keep and bear arms as foregone conclusion. The
<BR>
Constitution does not grant or guarrantee those rights, it merely states what
<BR>
rights are delegated by the people to the government, what rights cannot be
<BR>
infringed upon for any reason, and reserves all remaining rights, even those not
<BR>
even thought of yet, to the people (9th amend) who can delegate those remaining
<BR>
rights to their state government if they so choose (10th amend). The right to
<BR>
bear arms is not declared by the constitution. The constitution merely states
<BR>
one reason why this individual right is a good thing, and that congress shall
<BR>
pass no law that infringes upon it. The only SCOTUS case that delves into this
<BR>
at any depth is 1939's US v Miller case, where Miller's attorney's never showed
<BR>
up to argue the case, and it is documented that the federal prosecutors lied in
<BR>
their arguments three or four times. There is a new case, US v. Emerson, that is
<BR>
coming up from the appeals court in Texas, where Judge Cummins has done one of
<BR>
the most thorough examinations of the 2nd amendment I've ever seen, and which
<BR>
may cause most, if not all, gun control laws in the US to be tossed out.
<BR>
<P>If you wish to debate the merits of an individual's right to defend themselves,
<BR>
you will be arguing with most all scholars and philosophers dating back to
<BR>
before Aristotle.
