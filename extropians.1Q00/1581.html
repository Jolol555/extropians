<EM>&gt; &gt; If we do eradicate every virus, and it later turns out we need a few &gt; &gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them to solve a particular problem, wouldn't we just create them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a lot easier to reverse-engineer them from observed behaviors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than to create them from scratch for specific purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you need to start from scratch?  I would assume that while we
<BR>
are eradicating them, we'll be storing the information on what they are,
<BR>
how they're built, what they do... and so on.  IOW, we'll be doing the
<BR>
reverse engineering upfront.
<BR>
<P>There may be good and valid reasons for not destroying all viruses.  It
<BR>
may even be that it is simply too much trouble and not worth the effort,
<BR>
but at this stage of the game, the possible evolution of viruses isn't a
<BR>
reason at all as far as I can see. 
<BR>
<P>I may have had a misimpression.  I thought that the broad outlines of
<BR>
the near term future were already agreed upon by the members of this
<BR>
list.  That problems such as &quot;are viruses valuable and what can they
<BR>
evolve into?&quot; will be solvable by applying a tiny fraction of the nearly
<BR>
unlimited intelligence and processing ability available.
<BR>
<P>Is superintelligence still a contested issue?
