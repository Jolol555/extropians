Well, here we go again!  And they said a second world-war just would not 
<BR>
happen! lol!  I do enjoy reading Mike Lorrey's posts though(there sure are 
<BR>
enough of them! lol).  I do wonder when our resident power (Greg Burch) will 
<BR>
decide when to say, &quot;enough is enough!!&quot; ;)

the right of individuals to defend themselves was quite a commonplace 
<BR>
assumption. Madison wondered why it was needed only because he could not 
<BR>
fathom a society that would not take the right to keep and bear arms as 
<BR>
foregone conclusion.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I remember a &quot;This week with David Brinkley&quot; episode where the more liberal 
<BR>
half of the 'talking heads' on the show stated that 'clearly' the right to 
<BR>
bear arms was only for those in the militia's of back then or the national 
<BR>
guard of today.  Not for the private citizen!  Madison must be rolling in 
<BR>
his grave!

Ok, done ranting. No need to plonk. I've said all I will say. I won't even 
<BR>
respond to whatever objections you all may find against my logic. I believe 
<BR>
if you reduce it to what's really important, your own and your loved ones 
<BR>
precious and maybe even immortal lives--if we here have our fondest wishes 
<BR>
come true, and then just use your imagination--dare to picture the worst 
<BR>
actually happening to you yes even to you and yours, then you will have to 
<BR>
agree that NO ONE has the right to FORCE you to be vulnerable.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I totally agree!!  Here in Alaska, you can actually get a concealed handgun 
<BR>
permit without much trouble.  Simply have no offending record, take a three 
<BR>
day class and get fingerprinted.  No need to beg a judge for it like in some 
<BR>
states.  My two closest friends have gotten them.
<BR>
<P>I don't feel threatened by the social environment here in Anchorage and so I 
<BR>
have not gotten one myself.  It might just save someone's life in the right 
<BR>
situation to have one(and be carrying) but they might 'stand their ground' 
<BR>
in a situation and wind up firing(causing injury or even death) where 
<BR>
without the gun they would have run away.  But then some situations cannot 
<BR>
be run away from...  It is a matter of having the right training and good 
<BR>
judgement.

*You* might say that. I must confess that every time I take public transport 
<BR>
I imagine what I nice way to travel it would be if I didn't have to worry 
<BR>
about somebody sitting next to me with a cannon in his pocket fantasizing 
<BR>
about the _Dirty Harry_ movie he watched last night.-
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Having a mentally unbalanced and homocidal person sitting next to you
<BR>
with a gun would be bad!  But if this person simply wants to protect 
<BR>
themself then you may really benefit when a group of thugs approach and he 
<BR>
pulls out the gun and orders them away.. or else.  Just hope he is 
<BR>
level-headed in such a situation and a good shot!  Again, if he has had 
<BR>
concealed weapons permit training the odds are much better that you will be 
<BR>
ok.
<BR>
<P>Ironically, my father lives in New York City and I would love to have a 
<BR>
concealment permit and a firearm before I went to visit him!!  I have been 
<BR>
there before and found it a very disturbing environment.  But the liberal 
<BR>
power structure there will not allow people, except in the most severe 
<BR>
cases(decided by a judge), to get a permit and a gun so they can protect 
<BR>
themselves!  I think one reason things are so much safer in Alaska (and we 
<BR>
have our share of dangerous characters) is that alot of people do carry and 
<BR>
you can never be sure just who is! ;)

My attitude probably doesn't make any practical difference to anything- -- I 
<BR>
live in the UK and have never seen a real, working handgun in this country 
<BR>
outside of a museum or an airport departure lounge --
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>But surely outside the UK you have gotten the chance to shoot one??  One of 
<BR>
life's pleasures is firing off rounds at a firing range.  Right Mike? lol!  
<BR>
Hunting is another pleasure.  But just don't waste the meat.
<BR>
<P>I am still mourning the loss of the only indoor firing range here in the 
<BR>
Anchorage area.  The idiot owner did not properly shield the area behind the 
<BR>
range and a high-powered round escaped and hit a home!  The state still runs 
<BR>
a nice outdoor range just out of town though.
<BR>
<P>I wonder how many lives (especially young) would be saved by trigger locks 
<BR>
or gun security boxes being made a necessity by law?  I realize seconds 
<BR>
count in the case of a home intruder and that people don't want to be 
<BR>
fumbling for a key but with (relatively) inexpensive protective cases with 
<BR>
keycodes, it would be a snap to input the code and gain access to the gun.  
<BR>
Is this asking too much?  I think if a person can afford a gun they should 
<BR>
be able to afford this also.  I view the NRA very favorably but think they 
<BR>
and my childhood hero, Charleton Heston, have both faltered on this.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>

<BR>
<P>P.S.  Mike, that is one damn nice collection of firearms you have! :)
