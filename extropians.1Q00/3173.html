Senator Kelly's campaign for genetic purity in America.  You know, I think

they mean *me*!- --

<BR>
<P>Aha!!  Perhaps you will eventually get an invitation in the mail, inviting 
<BR>
you to attend Professor Xavier's school for &quot;gifted&quot; youngsters!  His school 
<BR>
and Starfleet Academy were my first choices for college. :)  And watch out 
<BR>
for giant sentinal robots visiting your home in search of you!  Your family 
<BR>
would not appreciate that.

It's been suggested that I may have modelled myself after Professor X...

<BR>
<P>So, now I know why Eliezer is on the list!  Actually, I think if Max is like 
<BR>
Professor X, then Natasha must be like the Shi'Ar empress, Lilandra, who is 
<BR>
a woman of great fortitude, intelligence and beauty.  What touched me about 
<BR>
their relationship was how despite their love for eachother, each knew they 
<BR>
could not stay together because of deep commitments that caused both of them 
<BR>
to live light years apart.
<BR>
<P>In that photo of Max with the beard and pony-tail I tend to think of one of 
<BR>
the villain's that fought the X-Men! lol  Considering some of the views 
<BR>
here, I wonder how some list members would act if they had the powers of a 
<BR>
Magneto (archnemesis and former good friend of Professor X).
<BR>
<P>I loved the Senator Kelley website!  It was very clever and fun.  I enjoyed 
<BR>
Doug Jone's comment, &quot;And why does no-one remember growing up with him?&quot; 
<BR>
lol!!  In the thirties I bet Doug would have been taken in by the Orson 
<BR>
Welles radio drama! :)  Remember what happened to the timeline where Kelly 
<BR>
was assassinated??  Not a nice place to live.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to the upcoming &quot;X-Men&quot; motion picture.  I hope they do it 
<BR>
justice.  The casting has been interesting to say the least but I did jump 
<BR>
for joy when Patrick Stewart got the role of Professor X!!!
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
