<EM>&gt; Actually, they don't. Taxing a barter exchange would be classified as a

<EM>&gt; direct tax, which the Supreme Court has continually said is

<EM>&gt; unconstitutional for the federal government to tax. The states can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impose direct taxes. The feds can only impose indirect taxes, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tariffs, excises, and duties. The Income Tax is actually an income duty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but legally it is only required to be paid by residents of federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property and resident aliens, everyone else who resides in the 50 states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pays the income tax voluntarily. Those who point to the 16th Amendment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know or understand what that Amendment actually did. What it did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was establish that an income tax is an indirect tax, and that it can

<EM>&gt; people.

<P>Mike, I'm sorry, but this is nonsense.  The IRS can and does tax
<BR>
barter-based income, it has does so for decades, and it has sent thousands
<BR>
of people to prison for failure to pay.  The IRS also can and does tax
<BR>
*everyone* who earns money in the U.S. *or* holds U.S. citizenship, and
<BR>
again they've put thousands of people in jail for non-compliance (not to
<BR>
mention the vast amounts of personal property the regularly confiscate to
<BR>
cover unpaid taxes).  Your arguments have long since been discarded by the
<BR>
mainstream legal community, and unless that changes they aren't going to do
<BR>
you a bit of good in court.
