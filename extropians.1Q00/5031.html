<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is one thing to hold the opinion that infinitely copiable memespace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assumption check: Who says memespace is infinte? In a finite universe, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a limited amount of memespace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should be fenced off and privately held the same way as uncopyable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dirtspace, but it is quite another to continue claiming that those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; oppose the former also oppose the latter when you know that's not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memescapes and landscapes are equal to me. I am equally comfortable living in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the land of ideas as I am living in concrete reality. This is one reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even extropians have let the socialist statists at ICANN steal the whole kit and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kaboodle out from under us. Since eventually that is where most of us will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living one day, failing to see memespace as real estate is a serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miscalculation.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are once again confusing two separate things--namespaces such as those
<BR>
administered by ICANN and Trademark law (and which are indeed uncopiable
<BR>
scarce resources like land, and which I have always supported property
<BR>
rights in), and Patents, which were the subject of this thread.  Come back
<BR>
to this debate when you understand the difference and can stay on-topic.
<BR>
<P>A piece of fish, and the lake from which I fish are singular scarce
<BR>
resources; if you use them, you lessen what I can use.   The name &quot;Joe's
<BR>
Quality Fish&quot; is a scarce and valuable resource.  If you use that name,
<BR>
you commit fraud by pretending to be me and you lessen the value that
<BR>
name has to my customers.  My _method_ of fishing is different.  If you
<BR>
watch me fish on my lake, then copy what I do on your own lake and
<BR>
sell your own fish under your own name, you are not stealing my fish
<BR>
or my name, you are just competing in a market I created, and our
<BR>
respective customers will decide who is better.  Just because I created
<BR>
the market doesn't give me any right to muscle out my competitors.
<BR>
<P>Patents and copyrights pretend to protect &quot;property rights&quot; in the
<BR>
space of ideas and expressions; what they really protect is the _market_
<BR>
for products based on those ideas.  If the government stepped in to
<BR>
grant a monopoly market to an apple farmer, shutting down farmers who
<BR>
grew their own apples on their own land, we would rightly call that an
<BR>
act of force.  I don't see any reason to change that opinion just
<BR>
because farmer A &quot;invented&quot; apple farming by doing it first.
