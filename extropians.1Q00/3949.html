Chinese green tea lowers cholesterol level through an increase in
<BR>
fecal lipid excretion.

<P>Lung Chen Tea, a Chinese green tea, has been found to lower serum and
<BR>
liver cholesterol. In this study, its
<BR>
dose response and mechanisms of action on cholesterol lowering in
<BR>
diet-induced hypercholesterolemic
<BR>
Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated. The activities of three major
<BR>
lipid metabolizing enzymes,
<BR>
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase,
<BR>
cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and fatty acid
<BR>
synthase (FAS), as well as fecal excretion of bile acids and
<BR>
cholesterol were examined. Lung Chen Tea
<BR>
administration for eight weeks significantly lowered the serum
<BR>
cholesterol in the 2% and 4% groups. The
<BR>
activities of the three enzymes were not affected by Lung Chen Tea,
<BR>
but the fecal bile acids and cholesterol
<BR>
excretions were significantly increased. These results demonstrated
<BR>
that Lung Chen Tea lowered plasma
<BR>
cholesterol by increasing fecal bile acids and cholesterol excretion.
<BR>
Further investigation is required to evaluate
<BR>
the exact mechanisms of action of Lung Chen Tea.
