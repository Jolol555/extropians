<EM>&gt; You're probably thinking of Austria.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People who live in the country, or the bush as we call it, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe 10 percent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or less of the population I guess, often own those big long 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons you use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to kill animals with. They tell the policeman about them, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he writes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down. Then when they kill humans  the policeman knows who did it. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work very well, because a while back a young 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sociopath shot dead a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of humans because he felt sad and rejected. Now he lives 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in jail and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone hates him even more. They don't let him have his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons in there.
</EM><BR>
<P>i think you are underestimating the number of guns in australia.  IIRC, the
<BR>
estimates are between 4 and 5 million guns in the country.  Granted, i've
<BR>
seen very few people carrying guns around the city (all of them belonging to
<BR>
the same state-funded organisation), but this doesn't mean that people don't
<BR>
have access to them.  In any case, gun related homicides rates seem to be a
<BR>
fourth of the US's and gun related deaths a fifth (from the i assume pro-gun
<BR>
control site <A HREF="http://www.iansa.org">http://www.iansa.org</A>) and seemed to have dropped quite a chunk
<BR>
since the tasmanian incident.
