</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those molecules that make up the Mona Lisa or the Declaration of Independence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is no more unique and valuable than the information content of a rock, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more appropriately a person-made rock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are merging distinctly different things.  The *essence* of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument is the degree of information content that can be meaningfully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpreted by someone with regard to how far it is from random &quot;stuff&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Perhaps I am. Let me give a short scenario: I'm an alien being that has
<BR>
the M.L., the D.o.I, and an atomic sized IBM marquee. After a physical
<BR>
analysis for information content of the different objects in terms of
<BR>
their deviation from &quot;random&quot; stuff, what do you think my conclusion
<BR>
would be? And second, which object has the most &quot;unique and valuable&quot;
<BR>
informational content? My point here, is that it is the observer that
<BR>
determines uniqueness and value of the information comprising an object,
<BR>
regardless of its actual, physical deviation from random stuff.
<BR>
<P>Hmm. I wonder if we are really in agreement here, but are somehow
<BR>
talking past each other. Or, talking about two different things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Natural rocks, even in their many possible molecular configurations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have significantly less information content than the M.L. or D.o.I.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because to specify the information content of the latter you also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to specify (in some way) the information content (perspective?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the creator *and* the individuals who can *interpret* the creation.
</EM><BR>
<P>But you would have to do this for the person-made rock as well, so I
<BR>
might argue that at least that portion can fall out of the comparison.
<BR>
Question: Is the information content of a person-made rock that looks
<BR>
exactly like a rock that could have been generated au natural have more,
<BR>
the same, or less informational content than a person-made rock that is
<BR>
clearly artificial? What about the &quot;uniqueness and value&quot; associated
<BR>
with both of those types of information?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The rock's type and distribution of molecules can be described highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurately and there is probably only a very *limited* amount of additional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information (e.g. the history of its formation) that can be determined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from that.  The M.L./D.o.I. on the other hand can have volumes written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about what went into them and the impact(s) they have had on other information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless you can make an argument that that is true for the rock as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well, I believe your statement to be inaccurate.  (While you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;invent&quot; a system in which the person-made Rock did have the value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the M.L. or D.o.I., said system doesn't exist currently and as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result I would say that the uniqueness and value of the rock is less.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Let me see if I can summarize here. To you, the criteria for assignation
<BR>
of &quot;value&quot; to information is the amount it deviates from randomness? (If
<BR>
I've over simplified, or completely missed the point, please tell me.)
<BR>
Plus, the amount/type/presence of &quot;intent&quot; behind the generation of said
<BR>
information? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is the degree of separation from simply random organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of molecules (and perhaps the driving power to create new non-random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; molecular organizations) that determines the &quot;value&quot; and &quot;quality&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is the entire basis behind extropianism.  Random stuff sucks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its simply noise.  Non-random stuff, particularly that created with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some intention behind it (and which may create further intentions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and non-random stuff) is the alter where we worship (figuratively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaking of course... :-))
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
So, if I created a process that produces random stuff and displayed it
<BR>
as art which then inspires countless volumes and treatises on the nature
<BR>
of art, my art objects, etc. that has less(more?) &quot;value and uniqueness&quot;
<BR>
than a process of deliberate, intentional acts that produce seemingly
<BR>
random looking art? (Most modern art comes to mind here, for me. Your
<BR>
mileage may vary, which, incidentally, is kinda my point.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From a physics standpoint, you have to argue that the rock has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater negentropy than the Mona Lisa.  If the rock were created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to serve as evidence that it came from Mars and demonstrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the existence of life on Mars a billion years ago, then I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grant the case, but if its trying to pass as an ordinary hunk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of granite, I would disagree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [Scientific Analysis Mode &quot;On&quot;.]
</EM><BR>
<P>[Some fantastic analysis of the informational content of the genome
<BR>
snipped. This is exactly what I was looking for in a response, btw,
<BR>
thank you. It's fun to play Devil's Advocate.]
<BR>
<P>Ok, so what does it say about a culture, their intent, mindset,
<BR>
technological capabilities, if they make a rock and it looks exactly
<BR>
like a natural one (down to the atomic level)? Doesn't this then give my
<BR>
rock more &quot;informational content&quot; (according to what I believe your
<BR>
position to be) associated with it than the M.L.? Or not, if you count
<BR>
my rock's apparent non-deviation from &quot;random-looking&quot; stuff. But, I
<BR>
think &quot;uniqueness and value&quot; could definitely be argued in favor the
<BR>
M.L.'s &quot;informational content&quot;. (Or, maybe not. =)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree with this.  The issue is very complicated and but to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking it is due to the *huge* difference between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information content of genomes and minds that is unrecognized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by most.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Here the case is much more clear, I think. But, do you factor integrated
<BR>
potential into your equations? Does the high probability of the genome
<BR>
&quot;naturally&quot; developing into something with a mind bring it closer (in
<BR>
any way) to being of the same informational content? Same uniqueness and
<BR>
value?
