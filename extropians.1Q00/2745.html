<EM>&gt; the oscillation period is 85 minutes on a constant density earth-

<P>&quot;Frictionless rail&quot;?
<BR>
Hey buddy, I've got this great perpetual motion machine...
<BR>
<P>Seriously though, how do you get a &quot;constant density earth-sized sphere&quot;?
<BR>
One of the problems I've got with dismantling Mercury is what happens
<BR>
as you peel off the outer crust and the core starts to &quot;spring back&quot;
<BR>
at you releasing the gravitational energy that is compressing it.
<BR>
<P>Another problem that you might help with....
<BR>
Does the orbit of a planet change if you reduce its mass?
<BR>
As I gradually remove the material from Mercury, I can vector the
<BR>
direction of the material (within some limits).  Can I use that to
<BR>
alter the orbital plane of the planet (leaving behind solar collectors
<BR>
as little planetary turds...)?
<BR>
<P>Then, what happens to the escape velocity if I &quot;grow&quot; a canopy of solar
<BR>
cells above the planet (suspended on hydraulic lifters).  This gradually
<BR>
converts the planet from a solid sphere into hollow ball.   Do my energy
<BR>
costs to &quot;lift&quot; material to the solar cell canopy level change
<BR>
significantly as the canopy mass grows (and expands) while the
<BR>
remaining planetary mass shrinks?
<BR>
<P>And if you are really ambitious...
<BR>
Can we build diamondoid (on Venus) or iron (on Mercury) towers into
<BR>
space?  By &quot;space&quot;, I presume I mean the point at which at the tower
<BR>
tip, you are traveling at &quot;orbital&quot; velocity.  Hmmmm, now that I think
<BR>
about this, does this even work for Mercury given its slow rotation?
<BR>
<P>It would seem there are two solutions to this problem.  One would
<BR>
be to decrease the mass of the planet until the towers can support
<BR>
themselves.  The other would be to increase the rotational rate
<BR>
of the planet so even the tips of very short towers are at orbital
<BR>
velocity.  (You can probably see where I'm going with this...
<BR>
How much do I have to drop the mass of Mercury (or increase its
<BR>
rotational velocity) before I no longer have to &quot;shoot&quot; things
<BR>
into space, but can simply &quot;walk&quot; them out of the gravity well.
<BR>
<P>If it helps, Xenology says:
<BR>
&quot;The maximum height of rocky ranges is therefore proportional to their
<BR>
weight, the product of the mass and the force of gravity. Higher gravity
<BR>
planets will have smaller, squatter mountains, because the limits of
<BR>
compressive strength of rock are reached much sooner. At least down to
<BR>
about 0.1 M_earth or so, smaller worlds should tend to have taller
<BR>
formations. As has been discovered with craters on the bodies in our
<BR>
solar system, the height of mountains should statistically vary inversely
<BR>
as the force of surface gravity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>On most mountains the rock has a compressive strength of 1500-1800
<BR>
Atm or 1.52x10^8 N/m^2.  The compressive strength of alpha-iron is
<BR>
~14,900 atm (1.51x10^9 N/m^2) and gamma-iron is ~33,700 atm
<BR>
(3.41x10^9 N/m^2). Young's modulus for diamond of 1.05x10^12 N/m^2.

<EM>&gt; &gt; What a nerd!  :-)  Amara

Well, Amara, I've got a picture of you sitting at your desk (from
<BR>
the Proceedings of the '88 Interstellar Dust conference) and I'd
<BR>
say from the looks of things we can safely say that you and Spike
<BR>
probably belong to the same stellar class.
