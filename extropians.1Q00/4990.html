News.com has an article on delays in Jini technology, which is Bill Joy's
<BR>
project:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The age of the Internet dishwasher was upon us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That, at least, is what Sun Microsystems promised last year with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduction of its Jini software. The next-generation technology was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to create a new world of network-connected devices--videocameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DVD players, lamps and coffee makers--that would be &quot;on the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within 1999.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the ambitious timetable for the futuristic technology turned out to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be more fiction than science. Although companies are beginning to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jini into their plans, no major products have hit the market in the year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the software was trumpeted.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's pretty obvious what the holdup is, given Bill Joy's
<BR>
recent article in Wired.  He envisions hordes of suddenly-intelligent
<BR>
dishwashers, coffeepots and toaster ovens joining together in a massive
<BR>
war of machines against humans.  Desperate to avoid the sad fate of
<BR>
being replaced by his own appliances, he is fighting furiously behind
<BR>
the scenes to delay the project.
<BR>
<P>Our only hope for survival is if Bill can put the Jini back in the
<BR>
bottle...
<BR>
