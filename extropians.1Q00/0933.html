<P><EM>&gt; To have a world of mature nanotech with nanoassemblers in every home  is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dream of mine.  But I wonder if the government would allow the public direct 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to nano assemblers?
</EM><BR>
<P>John, as I've stated before, since the are unlikely to be able to stop it
<BR>
(unless we have a police state), the question is how to allow it (usefully)
<BR>
without allowing it (dangerously).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the cause of preventing terrorism as well as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidents I could see the governments of the world only allowing direct 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to nano to government and corporate entities.  The ulterior motive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be to maintain their strong control over society.
</EM><BR>
<P>The ulterior motive is you don't want people to steal or destroy what
<BR>
you've got.  We don't spend all that money on defense to be annoyingly
<BR>
agressive, we do it to protect our lives and property (and perhaps
<BR>
recently in very *debatable* (though its a *different* thread)
<BR>
actions where we claim to be protecting others lives and rights).
<BR>
Control isn't so much a part of it, though sometimes it looks that
<BR>
way (the Internet Pharmacy debate may open up a whole discussion of
<BR>
who the &quot;gatekeepers&quot; of society should be -- looks to me like the
<BR>
AMA has paid off the Clinton administration).
<BR>
<P>Now the problem is *not* having an assembler in your home.  The
<BR>
problem is in using it dangerously or incorrectly (sounds like
<BR>
the radio-transmitter/wiretapping debate).  So really the problem
<BR>
comes down to how do you prevent general purpose assemblers from
<BR>
being used incorrectly.  Well it sounds like we are back not to
<BR>
regulating the assemblers but regulating the *designs*!
<BR>
<P>I think the general direction will be &quot;non-tamperable&quot; assembler
<BR>
boxes (i.e. if you open it, it turns into smelly sticky gloop)
<BR>
and encrypted (and verified) designs.  So while the design
<BR>
itself is open source, it has to be verified, check-summed,
<BR>
encrypted and transmitted to the assembler by &quot;approved&quot;
<BR>
organizations.  This is similar to the way that DVD's were
<BR>
supposed to work (until someone messed up and forgot to encrypt
<BR>
the decoding keys in one vendor's product...).  The assemblers
<BR>
(similar to the DVD players) will only assemble designs that is
<BR>
approved and untampered with.
<BR>
<P>So, you get most of the benefits plus the reliability and safety
<BR>
checks that most sane citizens would want.  Sure, there will
<BR>
be those &quot;you can have my unlicensed assembler over my dead
<BR>
body&quot; types of folks, but I suspect most people would view
<BR>
them with the same appeal as they view someone with a couple
<BR>
of kg of plutonium sitting unguarded in their back yard.
<BR>
<P>IMO, you can be as stupid as you want until your stupidity
<BR>
starts making me look stupid.  (many :-))
<BR>
<P>Now, the real trick will be creating some separation of power
<BR>
between organizations, such as &quot;governments&quot; (who might want to
<BR>
control behaviors) or industry &quot;monopolists&quot; (such as the DVD
<BR>
consortium) and the &quot;verification/approval/encryption&quot; organizations.
<BR>
Presumably you would want something like this done by some kind
<BR>
of non-profit foundation whose primary interest is in verifying
<BR>
that the designs are safe, not in regulating what people do with
<BR>
them.  You do not want to get into a situation where someone like
<BR>
Natasha designs something but since it doesn't fit the paradigm
<BR>
of how the &quot;powers&quot; want the society to look, she can't get the
<BR>
approvals required to get it assembled.  I suspect this will
<BR>
end up looking a lot like the current drug approval processes
<BR>
(with a lot more engineering science).
<BR>
<P>In the long run, I would imagine the lawyers will be quite busy
<BR>
fighting some interesting battles over what you do or do not have
<BR>
the right to assemble.  However these will be at the forefront
<BR>
or edges of the phase-space.  Most people will take the tried
<BR>
and true and improve on it a bit, submit it and get it approved
<BR>
rapidly.  This would be the lowest risk approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And even if so, would these be close to the &quot;anything  boxes&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we hope for?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe in the long run (20-30 years), if we get Minting and we
<BR>
get some reasonable IA for design, you will get just about &quot;anything&quot;
<BR>
boxes.  The tough part may be getting some rare element (e.g.
<BR>
gandolinium(?) for magnetic refrigerators) so there may still
<BR>
be some interesting supply constraints.  But as always there
<BR>
will be alternate approaches and substitutions so these may
<BR>
not be strongly constraining.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to think that in the world we are brought back into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (cryonic reanimation) there will be home models that can build houses 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and vehicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Without a doubt, but it raises the whole issue of being reanimated
<BR>
&quot;virtually&quot; when the house and vehicles are all bits in the simulation
<BR>
but you don't know the difference.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the question, it got me to clarify a loose jumble of
<BR>
thoughts in my mind.
<BR>
