<P>Further: consider this singularity notion.  Ignore for the sake of
<BR>
argument the SINGULARITY where all the computers rewrite
<BR>
their software to become some unknown new entity.  Consider the
<BR>
singularity as described by Damien et.al. where the rate of change
<BR>
becomes so rapid that forecasting becomes difficult or impossible;
<BR>
a gray curtain hides the future, etc.
<BR>
<P>In some limited sense, are we not there right now?  I am at a loss
<BR>
to tell the very young what they should spend their energies on,
<BR>
because *I do not understand their times*.  Those who do not
<BR>
spend time thinking about the future have no such misgivings, they
<BR>
simply pass on their own values, which to the casual observer are
<BR>
clearly inappropriate.
<BR>
<P>For instance, I saw a TV interview with a teenager who was
<BR>
being asked her vision of the future.  She said she wanted to
<BR>
get the &quot;money thing&quot; out of the way by 30.  The money thing!
<BR>
That was the most hilarious comment.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>But consider for a moment: one of those kids I mentioned in
<BR>
an earlier post, whose father invested in her behalf.  Depending
<BR>
on how I count net worth, this child of not yet 7 years may
<BR>
already have a net worth which exceeds mine, or if not, will
<BR>
have soon.  My value system led me to never invest in any
<BR>
company which has not bricks and mortar.  Her stock portfolio
<BR>
contains no companies that do own these relics.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, how could I or anyone teach her the value of money?
<BR>
Would I advise her to doggedly refine the skills that lead to a 9-to-5
<BR>
in a cubicle farm, such as mine?  While I was busy toiling my
<BR>
life away thus, she was playing barbie dolls and messing her diapers,
<BR>
while cleanly passing me on the financial inside lane.  If she merely
<BR>
understands investing, there is no need for her or her contemporaries
<BR>
to ever bother with these things at which we worked so hard.
<BR>
<P>Earlier generations never needed to worry about what to teach
<BR>
the young, they already knew.  No questions asked.  Moderns
<BR>
who ponder not, similarly have no problems: they simply pass
<BR>
on notions that are now incorrect, inappropriate or useless.  In
<BR>
this sense, the singularity is not really a future thing, it is upon us.
