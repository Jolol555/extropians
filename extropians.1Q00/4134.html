<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to have your photo taken without fear
<BR>
that the camera would steal your soul, the Murdoch Oz national newspaper
<BR>
(the same one that runs my science book reviews) publishes a Review cover
<BR>
story on Icelander genomics. The picture filling the front page of this
<BR>
arts/fashion weekend supplement shows a white-haired chap with DNA strands
<BR>
patched on his chest. Bold headline:
<BR>
<P>&quot;This man's genes are priceless&quot;
<BR>
<P>subhead:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In giving their precious DNA to science, have Icelanders sold their souls
<BR>
as well as their genes?&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is immediately arresting on several grounds, not least because the
<BR>
sub-editor apparently hasn't yet mastered the notion that if you *give*
<BR>
something away, one thing that's fairly certain is that you haven't *sold*
<BR>
it. 
<BR>
<P>At a deeper level, there's a clear implication that `genes' = `soul'.
<BR>
<P>(But apparently it's perfectly okay for us to read and listen to their
<BR>
cultural productions - hi, Bjork - although  that's the more obvious,
<BR>
data-rich place to look for someone's `soul'.)
<BR>
<P>There's another clear implication, that `science' = `Satan'.
<BR>
<P>Now, these genes that were simultaneously sold and donated are `priceless'.
<BR>
Why so? Let's see what the article, by Birna Helgadottir, says about this.
<BR>
The word actually does appear in the text:
<BR>
<P>`So far, deCode [the genomic company collating Iceland genetic information
<BR>
from `tens of thousands' of donations] has trawled a few treasures, but
<BR>
none as yet have been priceless' (p. 6).
<BR>
<P>Oh. So the cover lines should have been:
<BR>
<P>&quot;To date, this man's genes are not priceless&quot;
<BR>
<P>Not quite the same selling pitch, admittedly.
<BR>
<P>The standard silly-ass moves are inevitably in play. Cracking the codes of
<BR>
genetic diseases will lead to `A chance to end human suffering, to play
<BR>
God.' Say what? Are these two contrary options, or one and the same? How
<BR>
exactly *does* one `play God'? This used to be said of fierce fathers who
<BR>
forced their daughters into loveless arranged marriages - that is, took
<BR>
consequential decisions on behalf of someone else. Here it gets conflated
<BR>
with the same superstitious undercurrent  in `sell their souls'. Meddle
<BR>
with the secret divine power of the life-force! Oh no!
<BR>
<P>The writer's not all that much shakes with logic in general. `Bioneers'
<BR>
such as Craig Venter `claim the cost of genetic research makes the old way
<BR>
of doing things - applying for research grants, publishing findings in
<BR>
academic journals - redundant' (p. 5). Excuse me? *Redundant*? Perhaps
<BR>
`inadequate' or `antiquated' are the words on the journalist's protruding
<BR>
tongue? Maybe it's a sloppy translation?
<BR>
<P>There's much made of private funding of such research, and especially
<BR>
patenting of DNA sequences (concerns I happen to share somewhat), and even
<BR>
more especially when this is done with funding from outside the country
<BR>
whose database is being searched. But then we're told: `DeCode also enjoys
<BR>
public goodwill - increased, say cynics, by the share sale last summer that
<BR>
gave Icelanders a majority holding' (p. 6). How's that again? The complaint
<BR>
is that Icelanders are being ruthlessly ripped off; then it turns out that
<BR>
they're not; but wily cynics see though *that* cunning plan...
<BR>
<P>And it turns out that `There are disturbing ethical implications, too [in
<BR>
patenting human genes]. Think of the unhappy oncomouse, bred specifically
<BR>
to develop cancer and owned by DuPont, which holds the European patent' (p.
<BR>
6). WHAT? Aargh. The dysfunctional logic here is breathtaking, verging on
<BR>
criminal misrepresentation. Those poor little shivering mice, mutated by
<BR>
vile scientists playing God, which are doomed from conception to a hideous
<BR>
death. (Yes, that worries me, too, a bit. But better mice than men, I
<BR>
reckon.) If they do that to patented *mice*, the argument appears to run,
<BR>
nothing will stop them breeding patented humans specifically to develop
<BR>
ghastly diseases for research purposes. Oh no! Stop the Nazi bastards NOW!
<BR>
<P>Yet the overall tone of the article is cosy, knowing, in favour of medical
<BR>
advances and apple pie. The nearly-subliminal thought pollution babbles
<BR>
away in the background. Does that make it irrelevant, just a patina of mass
<BR>
media shock-horror to spice up the punters' spirits and get them to read
<BR>
this otherwise boring and indigestible science (ugh) stuff? I dunno. Makes
<BR>
me feel sick and dirtied, I can say that much.
<BR>
