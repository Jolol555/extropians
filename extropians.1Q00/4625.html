<EM>&gt; &gt; Non-digital,&quot; by the way, does not mean &quot;non-rational.&quot;  It's just that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  consciousness is fundamentally different in structure from any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  device out there, including so-called neural nets, altho they are a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  closer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is the opposite if digital-analog? Is life analog, or is mental computation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;analog? I wonder? Maybe intelligence goes through of phase of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pre-cybernetic,analog-then a digital culture-then analog, once again as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology advances?
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem here is that most &quot;uploaders&quot; seem to consider only the pattern 
<BR>
of neural impulses, their storage, tranmission, the particulars of the 
<BR>
neurons and how they process input to produce output.  In fact, this is only 
<BR>
one aspect of consciousness.  Transmisssion and storage of information also 
<BR>
takes place on totally non-&quot;digital&quot; levels, as in the focusing and 
<BR>
activations of groups or systems of neurons via hormonal discharge or 
<BR>
takeup, which may be experienced as emotion or various states of general 
<BR>
attention or preparedness.  Or the physiological feedback from your own body 
<BR>
as it serves to cue or clue.  You could then totally mimic the logic and 
<BR>
miss attaining a real upload at all.  But, in reality, you aren't mimicking 
<BR>
the logic, but only what that limited linear processing model takes into 
<BR>
account.
<BR>
<P>A friend who has spent most of his life trying to create real uploads 
<BR>
recently put it that the real Turing test is satisfied only when and if the 
<BR>
individual involved is convinced that he or she really is there in the 
<BR>
upload....  Unfortunately, the experience of brain injury suggest strongly 
<BR>
otherwise.  Unless there is at least the memory available, how would the 
<BR>
upload judge?  But to experience the memory - of a cognitive/emotional state 
<BR>
- would require that that capability exist.  So if it were missing, our 
<BR>
Stepford person upload would never miss it, except perhaps through a process 
<BR>
of complex analysis.  Rucker, in his &quot;Software&quot;, I believe, very nicely 
<BR>
paints the picture of someone who has just involuntarily lost a hemisphere 
<BR>
of his brain.  Halve of his visual field is gone as a result.  But it isn't 
<BR>
black or white or gray - or anything!  It just isn't there and the character 
<BR>
has to keep reminding himself that the rest of the universe does in fact 
<BR>
exist.
<BR>
<P>I have exactly that experience, visually at least, about every five years, 
<BR>
when I have a &quot;visual migraine.&quot;  I lose my left vision entirely and have to 
<BR>
keep reminding myself that there are things to my left.  It's not at all the 
<BR>
same as blinding the left eye, as then I could still easilly call up 
<BR>
memories from low levels. But when that part of your visual system stops 
<BR>
working, you can't even call up the memories.
