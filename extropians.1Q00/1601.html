Traditional mensur fencing, resulting in desireable face scars
<BR>
(Schmisse) is relatively common in many german student fraternities
<BR>
(Burschenschaften). It was a lot more popular in the 60s/70s, though.
<BR>
It is highly ritualized (these are not duels but scheduled
<BR>
swordfights, with body/eye protection, in a special settings, under
<BR>
the surveillance of a member (Schlagemeister?  websearch comes up with
<BR>
nothing, so I must misremember)) and far from being encouraged by
<BR>
universities.

<EM> &gt; &gt;I believe that dueling still occurs in some European places, in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;particular, someplace in Heidelberg, (but I haven't located it,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;yet). It's called mensur fencing.  One of the friends of my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;colleague proudly wears the scar across his cheek that he acquired
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;in his duel here. (These folks put salt in their cheek wound to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;make sure that the scar is noticeable when the wound heals.) The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;wearing of the scar is some kind of sign of honor (frankly, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;don't get it).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I always thought this was part of the University of Heidelberg, or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Konigsberg,  Heinlein mentions it in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; I believe.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I always remember Tycho Brahe and his golden nose, supposedly lost
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in a student duel over who was the greater mathematician......
