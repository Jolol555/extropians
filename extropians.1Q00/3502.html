<EM>&gt;&gt;They would settle somewhere, but I'm unconvinced that it would have much

<EM>&gt;&gt;connection with the average person's values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I'd rather use something like a science court approach - have economists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;compete to see whether they can produce an indicator that reliably predict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;what a randonly chosen group of people would decide if paid to study the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;question carefully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  For areas where such predictions have been proven reliable, I expect voter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pressure would be sufficient to produce the right result without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;constitutional rule. For the forseeable future, I expect there will remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;subject areas for which the indicators have not been shown to make reliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;predictions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If the disconnect between what voters want and what politicians do is high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough, then yes, a politically-chosen value function might diverge greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from what typical voters want.  But in this case I don't see much reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to expect that voter pressure would induce politicians to follow such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;demonstrated-reliable indicator; you'd need a more constitutional fix.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I was assuming that politicians will be about equally successfull at
<BR>
subverting the expressed opinions of the voters in either case, and am
<BR>
worrying about which approach will best insure that the expressed voter
<BR>
opinion correlates well with the voters' values. I think that asking
<BR>
voters to track down indicator problems by looking at numeric weights
<BR>
is likely to introduce errors because many people won't be willing or
<BR>
able to translate their values into numbers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm intrigued by the idea of using random juries to set the value function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But the details bother me.  You want the function that best predicts random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jury opinions over some distribution of decisions, given some distribution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the facts of the case.  But who decides the distribution of decisions?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I would have the voters decide, probably by grouping decisions into a few
<BR>
simple categories (economic, military, abortion/euthanasia/etc).
