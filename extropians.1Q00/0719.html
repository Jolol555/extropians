<P>
<EM>&gt; Is it feasible for the probes to be development &amp; observation/contact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designed to detect go/no-go status as they are closer to arriving? Then
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; needn't worry so much about the problem at the end of paragraph above.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is the best of the suggestions I've heard so far, but the one thing I'd
<BR>
like everyone to consider is that there is no reason why MULTIPLE probes
<BR>
can't be sent to the same system. When you're dealing with an exponential
<BR>
system like VNP's it's trivial to linearly increase the processing time. So
<BR>
why wouldn't the civilization simply send out several different classes of
<BR>
probes to the colony. Example:
<BR>
<P>Start with a &quot;detection&quot; probe. Send it out before the other ones. It's
<BR>
entire job is to detect advanced civilizations. If it does NOT detect them,
<BR>
after a pervasive search, then it flips a &quot;kill switch&quot; on the RF waves it
<BR>
was transmitting throughout its segment.
<BR>
<P>Then send in a contact probe and a colonization probe. Depending on the RF
<BR>
feedback they get, one switches &quot;off&quot; and the other one lives and performs
<BR>
its function.
<BR>
<P>Why do it this way? Because nature shows us we're a lot better off making
<BR>
globs of things that do really simple tasks but work well collectively
<BR>
rather than making swiss army knives.
<BR>
<P>Which actually leads me into my second point about VNP's. Why does everyone
<BR>
assume some kind of &quot;uniformity&quot; in the design. If VNP colonization were to
<BR>
occur, I think it would probably be very messy and look like a poorly
<BR>
designed computer network. My logic in this is that without FTL signalling
<BR>
you get an &quot;empire&quot; that is sufficiently large that the parts cannot
<BR>
communicate with each other on reasonable time scales any longer. Galactic
<BR>
travel timescales are so large for sublight travel that it would be
<BR>
completely impossible to have enough design foresight to make probes that
<BR>
were worth talking with by the time they get across the galaxy.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Oh, look hunny, there's a 140,000 year old probe over there. I'm sure it
<BR>
has TONS of information in it that we've never seen before, and all kinds of
<BR>
science that we've never discovered&quot;
<BR>
<P>Don't think so.
