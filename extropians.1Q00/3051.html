Hmmm... I wonder exactly who we are talking with on the net. OK, a   quick 
<BR>
survey: how many of us are AIs, posthumans, jupiter brains, fictional 
<BR>
people, uplifted squids, dogs or internet protocols?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have had this thought too! :)  A real A.I. could have a huge amount of 
<BR>
&quot;fun&quot; with us if it wanted to.  It could declare it's true nature and then 
<BR>
we would try to run it through the ringer to show it a human hoaxer.  Of 
<BR>
course, when it starts *demonstrating* what it can do (nationwide blackout 
<BR>
tomorrow at 6pm EST) we might begin to believe.
<BR>
<P>A century from now this will be a real dilemmma!  While today a person might 
<BR>
wonder if the other person on the net they are beginning to care about is 
<BR>
really telling the truth when they say they are just a bland, somewhat 
<BR>
upgraded transhuman.  Or are they an A.I., posthuman or some kind of 
<BR>
uplifted animal?  That VR image could be a big lie.
<BR>
<P>That's where a moller skycar comes in handy to pay them a visit.  Of course, 
<BR>
then the lament will be, if only I had the money to buy a ticket to visit 
<BR>
the distant solar system they're in!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
