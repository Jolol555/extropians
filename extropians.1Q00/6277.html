<P>
It seems clear to me that there is an indexicality associated with
<BR>
consciousness.  Out of all the physical processes going on in the
<BR>
universe, what _I_ experience is linked to how some neurons fire in this
<BR>
one particular human brain.  I don't know why this is the case, nor do I
<BR>
know what other physical processes give rise to consciousness.  I assume
<BR>
it arises in other human brains, and in other animals with similar nervous
<BR>
systems, just because the alternative seems unreasonable.
<BR>
<P>So, I buy the idea that if you gradually replace my neurons with
<BR>
computerized equivalents, I will continue to have conscious experiences,
<BR>
which will eventually arise completely from calculations taking place in a
<BR>
machine instead of biological neurons firing.  But I don't buy that if you
<BR>
create a software simulation that matches my neurons firing, leaving my
<BR>
brain intact, _I_ will ever have the experiences that the pattern of
<BR>
simulated neurons firing would have caused if they were real neurons
<BR>
firing in my brain.  I can conceive that a new consciousness would arise
<BR>
from the simulation, but it wouldn't be _me_.
<BR>
<P>It seems likely to me that my consciousness is attached to the particular
<BR>
quantum state of my brain.  Apply any continuous transformations that you
<BR>
want to this quantum state, and my conscious experience will change, but
<BR>
my identity will stay the same.  Create another quantum state &quot;out
<BR>
there&quot; somewhere that approximates my original one, and you may have
<BR>
created a new conscious entity, but it's distinct from me.
<BR>
<P>I think this fits well with the fact that there is a &quot;no clone theorem&quot; in
<BR>
quantum mechanics.  You can't get all of the information out of a quantum
<BR>
state without destroying it.  So any copy you attempt to make of the
<BR>
quantum state of my brain is either going to be inaccurate, or is going to
<BR>
destroy the original in the process.  Only in the latter case does it seem
<BR>
possible that my identity could be transferred.
<BR>
<P>I haven't read Max More's paper-- I'll try that.
