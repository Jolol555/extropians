<P>Hello J.R.,
<BR>
<P>You know, of course, that a hypothesis if gaining credibility among
<BR>
evolutional biologists that &quot;cooperation&quot; as a primordial genetic deter-
<BR>
minant of behavior may be as, or more, fundamental that &quot;competition&quot;
<BR>
relative to natural selection.
<BR>
<P>The basic question asked is: why is their not nothing but unicellular life
<BR>
on earth? Why are we not all bacteria?
<BR>
<P>What needs to be explained, in this view, is what would cause quint-
<BR>
essentially successful unicellular organisms to form communities and
<BR>
eventually a differentiation of labor in the development of multicellular
<BR>
organisms such as ourselves.  Whatever the cause, the effect obviously
<BR>
had survival value.  Interestingly, it seems to be turning out that our
<BR>
most threatening predator, our natural enemy, is our constituent
<BR>
ancestor, the bacterium.[1]
<BR>
<P>This hypothesis equates this &quot;cause&quot; with what we call &quot;sociality&quot;, or
<BR>
more simply, &quot;cooperation&quot;.  It is not merely that each constituent
<BR>
unit is perfectly selfish and in operating without the slightest interest
<BR>
in other units is so integrated into the whole that the survival of the
<BR>
organization is enhanced. To take one example, this organization will
<BR>
subordinate the interests of units to the the survival of the brain,
<BR>
sacrificing them as needed in the interests of collective survival.
<BR>
Autophagia of muscle tissue to supply the brain with essential nutrients
<BR>
is a case in point.[2]

[1] The virus seems to be an anomaly; it is merely a chemical reaction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that nevertheless behaves as if it were a parasite.
<BR>
[2] Obviously, the argument applies only to organisms whose diverse
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functions are ultimately integrated only by a central nervous system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is the only thing that stands between us and progressive,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminal necrosis.
