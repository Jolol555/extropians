</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Deeper into the Brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by Charles Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mr. Murray is the Bradley Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;National Review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;January 24, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We, Homo sapiens, are about to learn how to alter human nature at roughly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same time that we finally learn for sure what that nature is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Our ignorance about the underlying truth of human nature has not been for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want of trying. Philosophers took up the question as one of the very first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that human beings systematically asked about themselves. But philosophers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produced answers as various as Aristotle’s and Rousseau’s. Since the late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1900s, behavioral and social scientists too have tried to understand human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nature. But while they have illuminated many useful bits and pieces, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have failed as system-builders. What is left of Freud, out of the beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that were so intellectually pervasive in mid century? Psychotherapy remains,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in profuse variety, but only remnants of Freudianism. What is left of B. F.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Skinner? Behaviorism is still a productive branch of psychology, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Skinnerian vision of human nature that once seemed so compelling is dead. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for Marx, does anything at all survive? For more than a century, Marxism was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;throughout continental Europe the leading intellectual framework for thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about how political institutions can realize the nature of man. That edifice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has collapsed utterly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How can we have expended so much of our collective genius on understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human nature and still know so little for certain? Because up until now, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been able to observe only behavior. People can hold very different views
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of human nature—man is by nature altruistic or by nature selfish; by nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amoral or by nature endowed with a moral sense—because we observe in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human animal, in abundance, every sort of behavior. Or to put it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;statistically, human nature does not consist of universal human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characteristics but of distributions. Is mankind altruistic or selfish? From
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyday experience, we know that some people behave selfishly and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behave altruistically. When one says that human beings are by nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;altruistic or selfish, one is actually saying that a distribution of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human population on the characteristic of &quot;underlying biological propensity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to altruism&quot; will have a certain shape and median. The implications of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distribution in which, for example, the average value is &quot;fairly selfish&quot; has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very different implications from a bell curve in which the average value is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;fairly altruistic.&quot; The implications of a curve that is narrow and steep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(meaning that almost all human beings are very close to the median value) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very different from those of a shape that is wide and short (meaning that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human nature for this characteristic is all over the map).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that, while scientists can measure the observed shape of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these behaviors, they have been stymied by the nature/nurture problem. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is not to say that we know nothing. Just as geologists know a lot about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probability of finding oil based on rock formations on the surface,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychologists have learned to infer a lot about the heritability of observed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traits. But in both cases, the observer is dealing with outcroppings and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probabilities, while the exact, inarguable truth lies hidden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This situation is about to change. No one can tell how rapidly and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;completely the story will unfold. A few brave souls—brave indeed to buck the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consistent lesson of the last five hundred years of science—still argue that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the mysteries of the human mind will forever be mysteries. But E. O. Wilson’s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reading of the situation in his 1998 book, Consilience, seems much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plausible. The neuroscientists, increasingly understanding how the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;works, and the molecular biologists, increasingly understanding which genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do what, are about to link up with the social sciences, according to Wilson,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a &quot;webwork of causal explanation&quot; that brings human behavior within the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realm of rigorous investigation previously reserved for physical phenomena.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And not just individual behavior. &quot;The explanatory network now touches on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;edge of culture itself,&quot; in Wilson’s words—or to put it another way, we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the edge of understanding how human nature in individuals produces social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and political institutions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What we know now is fragmentary. But the speed with which that knowledge is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expanding is so fast, and accelerating, that it is reasonable to expect that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we are going to know a great deal about many, many aspects of human nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and their social implications within just a few more decades. By the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the 21st century, we will be approaching biological truth about these topics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It will be a winding road, with many false pronouncements that will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revised a year later, as new data come to light. Even those new findings that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are solidly based will seldom be exciting individually. We will not find an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aggression gene or a marriage gene or an IQ gene. Instead, we will learn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about complex combinations of genes and their alleles that affect a behavior,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and about how they interact with the unimaginably complicated neural and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hormonal processes that affect behavior. We will learn about the interaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between biology and environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TRANSLATION INTO POLITICAL CODES
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The practical importance of these impending discoveries lies in this: The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great conflicts of the last two centuries have in large part been the story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of differing views of human nature translated into political codes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Communism’s use of Marxism was the paradigmatic example, explicitly and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aggressively asserting that human nature is soft plastic that can be molded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into any configuration by society’s political and economic institutions. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the debates over social policy within the democratic West have also been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;underlain by conflicting understandings of human nature. Are mothers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;peculiarly suited to raising small children or can fathers do it just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well? Should women be in combat? The positions one takes are based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumptions about the innate differences between men and women. The welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state makes sense, or doesn’t, depending on underlying beliefs about how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human beings respond to economic incentives and, more profoundly, about how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human beings achieve satisfaction in life. Should we try to deal with crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by attacking root causes? Depending on your definition of &quot;root causes,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attacking them could mean an anti-poverty program or more prisons—and your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definition can ultimately be traced back to your beliefs about human nature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It will be a cumulative process, but, as time goes on, our increasingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain knowledge of human nature is going to shrink the wiggle-room for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain political positions. Think of the process as a scientific version of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Alger Hiss case. As of 2000, we have, analogously, already discovered the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pumpkin Papers. The scientific literature already in hand, not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common sense, gives us a pretty good idea of where this story is leading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just as dispassionate observers in 1948 had a pretty good idea that Hiss was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guilty. Hiss’s advocates defended his innocence for decades after the Papers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were found, but those advocates dwindled as new evidence periodically came to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;light. Finally the Venona intercepts were revealed, and the debate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effectively ended. So it will be with the uncovering of human nature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The choice of analogy betrays my own expectations of the unfolding story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What we already know leads me to believe that the story of human nature as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revealed by genetics and neuroscience will be Aristotelian in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophical shape and conservative in its political one. We will learn for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain such things as that women innately make better nurturers of small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children than do men and that men innately make better soldiers than do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women. Regarding these and many other human characteristics impinging on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marriage, the upbringing of children, and the enforcement of social order, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am predicting that the adages of the Right will usually prove to be closer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the mark than the adages of the Left, and that many of the causes of the Left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be revealed as incompatible with the way human beings are wired.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To put it in terms of Left versus Right, however, understates the magnitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of what is likely to happen. Of all the casualties of our growing knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of human nature, the most politically far-reaching will be the 20th century’s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;curious attachment to literal human equality. Let me draw on the response to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Bell Curve to illustrate what uncharted territory we are sailing into. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;authors of the book, Richard Herrnstein and I thought that The Bell Curve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contained powerful ammunition for the political Left. If IQ is important in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determining life’s outcomes and IQ is not acquired by merit, then one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legitimate line of argument is that the government should intervene to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up for the unfairnesses of nature and capitalism. What we did not realize was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how important the egalitarian premise is to the worldview of the Left. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not enough that governments guarantee equal rights to all; it is not even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough that governments intervene to equalize outcomes. It must also be true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that inequalities in individuals are the result of the social, economic, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political system, rather than of inherent differences in ability. I am still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not sure why this premise is so important—the intellectual case for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;redistributionist policies does not depend on it—but it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In their own way, politicians of the Right are equally in thrall to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;egalitarian premise. For example, no major Republican politician is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to say in public that some of the social problems we most deplore are rooted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to some degree in personal deficiencies. Try to imagine a GOP presidential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;candidate saying in front of the cameras, &quot;One reason that we still have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty in the United States is that a lot of poor people are born lazy.&quot; You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannot imagine it because that kind of thing cannot be said. And yet this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unimaginable statement merely implies that when we know the complete genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;story, it will turn out that the population below the poverty line in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;United States has a configuration of the relevant genetic makeup that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;significantly different from the configuration of the population above the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty line. This is not unimaginable. It is almost certainly true. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also almost certainly true that statistically significant distributions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological makeup separate just about any other groups that show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;substantially different patterns of behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BEYOND RACE AND SEX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The group differences that people obsess about have to do with race and sex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but let me try to reach past that reflexive response to make a broader point:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Statistically significant genetic differences beyond the self-evident ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably separate men from women, and people who call themselves &quot;white&quot; from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who call themselves &quot;black&quot; or &quot;Asian,&quot; but they also probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distinguish the English from the French, employed Swedes from unemployed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Swedes, observant Christians from lapsed ones, and people who collect stamps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from people who backpack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;None of this should be earthshaking. Often we will be talking of group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differences so subtle that they can be teased out only with the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sophisticated methods. Often these differences will have nothing to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse,&quot; but just vive la différence. Even when the differences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are substantial, the variation between two groups will almost always be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dwarfed by the variation within groups—meaning that the overlap between two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;groups will be great. In a free society where people are treated as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals, &quot;So what?&quot; is to me the appropriate response to genetic group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differences. The only political implication of group differences is that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must work hard to ensure that our society is in fact free and that people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fact treated as individuals. And yet I can tell you from personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience that &quot;So what?&quot; is not a response that many others share. Today,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to suggest that genetically based group differences are even probable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provokes a reaction that resembles hysteria.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;·Now imagine a world a few decades hence in which it has been demonstrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that biologically based differences separate individuals and groups, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some of these differences involve characteristics that are important to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;success in life. What will happen when a position that is taboo in public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discourse is proved to be scientifically accurate?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;··Nothing will happen, it might be argued. Even now, hardly anyone really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believes in his heart of hearts that the strictly egalitarian line is true,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so what difference will scientific proof make? But history suggests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;otherwise. Thomas Kuhn taught us in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that first the old scientific paradigm begins to show cracks, then those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cracks spread, and then, with remarkable speed, Kuhn’s famous &quot;paradigm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shift&quot; occurs. In just a few years, there are no more Ptolemaic astronomers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only Copernican ones; no more Aristotelian physicists, only Newtonian ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Today we are at the stage of the spreading cracks, even if the egalitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;premise seems more politically impregnable than ever. But when the scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debate eventually ends, it will not be merely a matter of scientists on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrong side saying, &quot;Oh, well,&quot; while the rest of our intellectual perspective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continues unchanged; with the displacement of the old paradigm comes a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way of looking, not just at isolated bits of scientific truth, but at the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world works. Think of the Newtonian revolution and the Enlightenment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Closer to our own time, the Darwinian and Einsteinian revolutions were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;central to the development of the nonscientific intellectual world of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;20th century. So too will it be with the consequences of the neurogenetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revolution that is about to unfold. It will have transforming effects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spill over into our conceptions of politics, religion, and social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relationships.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A NEW CAUSE FOR THE LEFT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A chief characteristic of a paradigm shift is that its consequences are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unexpected. But I can illustrate the nature of the spillover with one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;few obvious possibilities—that eugenics will become a cause of the Left. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obvious? After all, eugenics is not only in disrepute everywhere,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;eugenicist&quot; is one of the Left’s cursewords for people engaged in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neurogenetic research. But eugenics is in disrepute because of Nazism, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has led us to forget that before Nazism it referred to a movement centered in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Britain that was respectable and especially popular among intellectuals. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put it simply, the eugenicists made an assertion and drew from it a policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implication. Their assertion was that social problems would be greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reduced if the lower classes had fewer children and the better classes had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more. The policy implication they drew was that government policies should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;encourage that result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As the biological basis for personal qualities statistically associated with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;social problems—low IQ, impulsiveness, short time-horizons, sociopathy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indolence—is understood, the old arguments about causality (e.g., &quot;It’s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty and disadvantage that create the low IQ, not the other way around&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be resolved. There will still be a large role for environmental causes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and solutions to social problems, but understanding the portion that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological will permit analysts of the future to make fairly precise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forecasts about the extent to which changes in fertility patterns may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expected to affect crime and poverty. The only difference will be that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old eugenicists had to rely on a rough statement (&quot;the lower classes&quot;),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whereas eugenicists of the future will be able to be more precise (&quot;people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the following genetic profiles&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now turn to the eugenicists’ political conclusion, that government should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;act to shape fertility patterns. It is not something that today’s Left likes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to recall, but eugenicism was predominantly a movement of the British Fabian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and socialist Left, not of Tories or the old Liberals. This political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;affinity was no accident, for a reason expressed by Sidney Webb, one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brightest lights of British socialism. &quot;No consistent eugenicist can be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;‘Laisser Faire’ individualist,&quot; he wrote, &quot;unless he throws up the game in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;despair. He must interfere, interfere, interfere!&quot; Sidney and his wife
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Beatrice were joined in their enthusiasm for eugenics by the likes of George
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bernard Shaw, Emma Goldman, and H. G. Wells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As genetic engineering matures, a new, more insidious brand of eugenics will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become possible—one that does not require the lower classes to stop having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children, only to start having better children. This will be eugenics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tailor-made for a Left constituted of people who are more squeamish about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being repressive than their forebears, but who are just as ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interfere, interfere, interfere, in a good cause. Will the Right stand firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against this ultimate intrusion of government? I pray so. But don’t bet on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it. In the face of temptation, mainstream Republican politicians cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relied upon to say It’s None of the Government’s Business—an unhappy fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that may have reverberations when eugenics with a smiling face is upon us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have no idea how the new eugenicism will play out, only a general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expectation that eugenics, anathema today, will be a spinoff of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neurogenetic revolution tomorrow. My main point is that many such effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be triggered, that most of them are now unforeseeable, and that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will turn the intellectual and political landscape topsy-turvy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What of the broader manipulation of human nature? Putting aside government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intervention and confining ourselves to the voluntary choices of individuals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should we expect that Homo sapiens will take it into its collective head to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;redesign itself? I confess to a certain optimism. I suppose that sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selection will be common, and that some parents will, if they can, opt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make their babies more compassionate, or more competitive, or &quot;more&quot; of some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other personality trait that they favor. Some parents may want to grow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seven-foot-tall basketball players. But one of the main reasons that couples
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have babies is to produce their baby, the product of their combined genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Motivations don’t get much more basic than that, and I think it unlikely that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the typical parent will want to distort the process too much. The popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;voluntary uses of gene manipulation are likely to be ones that avoid birth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defects and ones that lead to improved overall physical and mental abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I find it hard to get upset about that prospect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One may hypothesize a variety of darker sides to the ability to manipulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human tendencies. There are the unforeseeable effects of homogenization, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example. A world in which all the children are above average might be duller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than we suppose. I am not confident in our ability to tweak the human sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the rhythm of life to correspond with the extensions in lifespan that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occur. More broadly, our ability to affect the physical aspect of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;animal may run ahead of our ability to accommodate those changes to the ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in which the human psyche achieves happiness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But these specific worries are the ruminations of a 20th-century man,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destined to look as myopic a century from now as the predictions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;19th-century men about the 20th. I am confident of just one thing: Many of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the people reading these words will live to see one of Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shifts—one as broad and deep, as demoralizing and inspiriting, as destructive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and creative, as any that has taken place before.
