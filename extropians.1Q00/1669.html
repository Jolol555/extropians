<P><EM>&gt;First, my visual imagination failed in an effort to construct the image of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a &quot;corpulent&quot; woman whose face was attractive when it swelled. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Just so. Not a pretty sight. (An apotropaic use of `attractive', if I might
<BR>
put it that way.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obscure reasons, I thought of Eugene Ionesco's play, whose title and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subtitle are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                               THE  BALD  SOPRANO
</EM><BR>
<P>Strangely, that play's called The Bald Primadonna over here. Maybe it's
<BR>
Brit vs. Yank translations?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Questions: [1] what, specifically, is endangered by this thought?; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever it is that drives many people to invents `souls', I assume; plus,
<BR>
as I suggested, a perfectly sane defensiveness in the face of what looks
<BR>
like (a) dehumanising rhetoric that purports to be describing (b) something
<BR>
that can't exist and hence (c) must have wicked undeclared designs upon us.
<BR>
<P>Phil Dick's fiction and essays were much concerned with this human vs.
<BR>
`android' theme, which resulted in powerful surreal fiction but badly
<BR>
confused ideation, IMHO.
<BR>
<P>[2]
<BR>
<EM>&gt;what is it in the conscious organization that is viewed as irreconcilable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with this idea, such that if the unconscious correlate were to gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious  ascendancy, any coexistence would be impossible and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current conscious ego-constiuent would be driven into oblivion?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't find the background psychodynamics in this formulation all that
<BR>
convincing, so I can't usefully comment. But clearly something along at
<BR>
least related lines must be involved. She was *extremely* angry.
