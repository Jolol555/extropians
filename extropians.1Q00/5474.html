<P>
James, you brought up some interesting points.  Native americans did have 
<BR>
complex political structures and many vicious wars(and war crimes) long 
<BR>
before the Europeans came.  But does 'right make right' in the taking of 
<BR>
their lands?  Of course we did this through a combination of combat, 
<BR>
disease, trade and squatting.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps in the modern day, American Indians are poor stewards of the land 
<BR>
(in some cases) but in the past they lived in general harmony with it, 
<BR>
knowing instinctively the ecological relationship they had with it.  The 
<BR>
mentality of European settlers in many ways shocked them with its 
<BR>
exploitation of the land and strict ownership mentality.
<BR>
<P>I have heard stories of financial mismanagement by Native American 
<BR>
organizations that have shocked me.  Here in Alaska the native corporations 
<BR>
have a flawed but generally much better record I think then their 
<BR>
counterparts in the continental U.S.  But in many of the villages 
<BR>
alcoholism, violence, sexual abuse and government dependancy have a strong 
<BR>
hold.  Native college students flunk out of college at about four times the 
<BR>
normal rate and to help with that a tutoring and outreach organization is 
<BR>
running strong on campus.  There is a native Alaskans engineering 
<BR>
organization on campus that is has been around for a long time.  There are 
<BR>
still many very strong Alaskan natives both in the cities and the villages.
<BR>
<P>I do find it ironic and sad that the state and federal gov't tell the native 
<BR>
people whether or not they can hunt certain animals and to what extent.  The 
<BR>
natives got along fine without us for centuries! lol
<BR>
<P>I can understand how angry feelings have arisen among natives towards 
<BR>
whites.  Alcohol was often used to take advantage of them and especially 
<BR>
their women.  Our diseases killed many of them.  We considered their 
<BR>
religion 'witchcraft' and banned it to be replaced by forced instruction in 
<BR>
our own religions.  Starvation was brought upon a large area when a fish 
<BR>
processing company sucked dry all the resources by banning natives from 
<BR>
doing their own fishing!  Public outrage from all sides stopped that.. 
<BR>
eventually.  Stores often had signs saying no dogs or natives.  Substandard 
<BR>
medical care and experimentation done without their knowledge.  The list 
<BR>
goes on.
<BR>
<P>Of course, millions of dollars came into native coffers with the discovery 
<BR>
of oil!  But that made only certain tribes extremely wealthy.  So now you 
<BR>
have some native groups feeling a great deal of envy or even hate toward 
<BR>
those who benefitted so much and only in limited ways 'shared the wealth.'  
<BR>
All natives do have free medical care at a nice hospital just for them here 
<BR>
in Anchorage.  Only recently was the building and certain personnel replaced 
<BR>
to make it a strong facility and not a joke like it partially was in the 
<BR>
past.  And only some natives get to attend college free though they have 
<BR>
huge scholarship funds that are not tapped as they could be.
<BR>
<P>I do think that the current generation of young natives are strong as a 
<BR>
whole and will do alright.  I hope so.  And I consider them native even if 
<BR>
their ancestors did come over the ice bridge! lol
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
