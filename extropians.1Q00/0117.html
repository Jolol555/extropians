Please forward to relevant groups and lists.
<BR>
<P>[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  I've been an Internet freedom activist for
<BR>
years.  In the course of my activism and communications with individuals
<BR>
around the world, I'm constantly amazed about the power the Internet brings
<BR>
to the average individual. I read with interest Declan McCullagh's
<BR>
announcement that Lycos launched a Vote 2000 political site.  Upon visiting
<BR>
the site I was disappointed to find that the site didn't list any
<BR>
Libertarian [Harry Browne's site <A HREF="http://www.HarryBrowne2000.org/">http://www.HarryBrowne2000.org/</A> ], Natural
<BR>
Law, Green, or any other third parties other than a small mention of a
<BR>
couple of Reform party candidates.  On the right side of the Lycos Vote
<BR>
2000 political web page are the party mascots of the Democratic Donkey and
<BR>
the Republican Elephant.  How can this be interpreted as anything other
<BR>
than a not too subliminal message endorsing only bi-partisanship.  If you
<BR>
think this need remedied, I encourage you to contact Lycos, Declan
<BR>
McCullagh &lt;<A HREF="mailto:declan@well.com?Subject=Re:%20Lycos%20Excludes%20Libertarians%20On%20Vote%202000%20Political%20Site&In-Reply-To=&lt;v0401170ab496d27c81b7@[198.4.94.209]&gt;">declan@well.com</A>&gt; and John Milne &lt;<A HREF="mailto:editor@primarydiner.com?Subject=Re:%20Lycos%20Excludes%20Libertarians%20On%20Vote%202000%20Political%20Site&In-Reply-To=&lt;v0401170ab496d27c81b7@[198.4.94.209]&gt;">editor@primarydiner.com</A>&gt; and
<BR>
ask them to cover all third parties and to at least not engage in
<BR>
bi-partisan deck stacking.]

<BR>
<P>WALTHAM, Mass.--January 3, 2000--Lycos, Inc. (NASDAQ LCOS), one of the

<BR>

<BR>
following the Democratic and Republican New Hampshire primary debates.
<BR>
<P>Users can pose questions to political journalists Declan McCullagh, chief
<BR>
Washington correspondent for Lycos, Inc.'s Wired News and John Milne,
<BR>
senior editor of PrimaryDiner.com, and continue interactive debates online
<BR>
with other users at <A HREF="http://chat.lycos.com/guests/debate.html">http://chat.lycos.com/guests/debate.html</A>.  Lycos Vote
<BR>
2000 will also provide links to Aprisma Management Technology, allowing

RealAudio/Video Webcasts and participate in real-time polling, during
<BR>
the debates on WiredVote.com, a Sirius Media product.
<BR>
<P>Lycos News Vote 2000 is a sponsor of the New Hampshire Democratic and
<BR>
Republican presidential debates.  Peter Jennings, anchor and senior editor
<BR>
of ABC's &quot;World News Tonight,&quot; will moderate the New Hampshire Democratic
<BR>
primary debate between Bill Bradley and Al Gore on Wednesday, January
<BR>
5, 2000 at 7 p.m. (EST).  Political reporter Tim Russert, of &quot;Meet the
<BR>
Press,&quot; and Washington bureau chief of NBC News, will moderate the New
<BR>
Hampshire Republican primary debate featuring Republican presidential
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
campaign politics--if not for the candidates themselves, then certainly
<BR>
for the growing number of &quot;Net-connected voters,&quot; said veteran print
<BR>
journalist George Shirk, editor in chief of Lycos Network News and
<BR>
Lycos' Wired News. &quot;As a major portal whose home is the Internet itself,

and useful campaign resource throughout the campaigns.&quot;
