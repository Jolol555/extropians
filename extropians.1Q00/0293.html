<EM>&gt; Having read the same article, I have the same questions. There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two basic kinds of GM foods, those that are created to enhance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutrition (micronutrient rice) and benefit consumers directly, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those designed to rake in profits for agribusiness by dumping huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantities of pesticides into the enviroment. (roundup soybeans)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, that isn't quite right.  Roundup is a herbicide, not a
<BR>
pesticide.  The engineering is to add an enzyme that makes the
<BR>
plants roundup tolerant so you can kill the weeds using roundup
<BR>
(a standard strategy with crops that are &quot;naturally&quot; roundup tolerant).
<BR>
<P>Fundamentally this is being done to increase yield (allowing the
<BR>
food crops to grow at the expense of the weeds).  If it didn't
<BR>
benefit the farmers (and indirectly the consumers) through
<BR>
higher yields (= lower prices), then they wouldn't sell any
<BR>
of the seed now would they?
<BR>
<P>The last time I went shopping and looked at milk, the &quot;organic&quot;
<BR>
milk was costing 1.5-2x the regular milk.  Those kind of price
<BR>
differentials make a big difference to people around the poverty line.
<BR>
<P>Here is an exercise for those of you who want to put your
<BR>
extropianism into practice -- go to the grocery store and
<BR>
really *study* what the price differentials are for &quot;organic&quot;
<BR>
foods, then compute the difference in your food budget based
<BR>
on going organic, then figure out what fraction of the population
<BR>
is simply unable to afford that.
<BR>
<P>Now, makeup an argument that would justify having poor people
<BR>
eat &quot;sub-standard&quot; food, if in fact that were really the case!
<BR>
The problem with labeling is that it is creating the impression
<BR>
that there are real qualitative differences between GM and non-GM
<BR>
food, ignoring the huge amount of plant breeding that has been
<BR>
done for millennia that has effectively &quot;engineered&quot; most of
<BR>
the food supply we now have.
<BR>
<P>The entire trend in agriculture is to produce more food at a lower
<BR>
cost.  Inherent in that process, the producers at the margin
<BR>
are going to get squeezed.  Their approach to that problem is to
<BR>
attempt to create a new &quot;organic&quot; market that they want to extend
<BR>
into a &quot;natural&quot; (unengineered) market, so they can produce
<BR>
at higher costs and still compete.   Its like Pepsi asking the
<BR>
government to put a warning on Coke-a-Cola products -- &quot;Warning
<BR>
this product may cause indigestion&quot;.  Whether or not Coke
<BR>
does that, the net effect will be to drive Coke drinkers to Pepsi.
<BR>
<P>Its unextropian because its a marketing ploy, not a rational
<BR>
scientific discussion.  I will freely admit that the anti-GM
<BR>
food people do have some legitimate complaints (e.g. antibiotics
<BR>
in the food), but they are stretching the arguments to the breaking
<BR>
point.  If you read between the lines, it is *no* GM-food, *no*
<BR>
pesticides, *no* herbicides, and while we are at it lets
<BR>
get rid of the &quot;green&quot; revolution (since those crops don't
<BR>
work without high fertilizer levels), then don't even think
<BR>
about going to your nice programming job today because you've
<BR>
got to turn over a couple of hundred square meters of dirt
<BR>
in your back yard so you can plant your crops so you have something
<BR>
to eat this winter.  Oh, and the millions of people that starve
<BR>
to death on our &quot;back to nature&quot; drive, well heck, they're just
<BR>
road-kill.
<BR>
<P>Most of the people on this list are sitting in nice suburbs or
<BR>
cities in the U.S., Europe, Australia, etc. and don't have a
<BR>
clue what agriculture is like at the margins.  I'm sitting in
<BR>
Russia and almost every Russian I know *has* to grow food at their
<BR>
Dacha (country house) if they expect to survive above the
<BR>
poverty level.  It is wonderful when those of us who are
<BR>
successful enough can grow our own food as a hobby or because
<BR>
we don't like the taste of mass-produced agriproducts (Russian
<BR>
Dacha-grown tomatoes are much better than U.S. mass-produced!),
<BR>
but it is quite different if you *have* to grow that food in order to
<BR>
simply survive.  You show the people here a GM-food that has better
<BR>
nutrition (improving their health) or can tolerate the application
<BR>
of a relatively inexpensive, moderately safe herbicide (reducing
<BR>
their labor) and you will have them lined up in queues to purchase
<BR>
your product (if it is available cheaply enough).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It easy to understand why agribusiness opposes mandatory labeling,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their products will be unpopular with consumers any fail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economically.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely, but you don't explain *why* those products will fail.
<BR>
They will fail because of public &quot;perception&quot; manufactured by
<BR>
the environmentalists that these foods are unsafe or harmful.
<BR>
Since there isn't very much evidence for that, it would be
<BR>
unextropian (irrational) to support practices that promote mass
<BR>
delusions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are they safe? Corporations have limited liability remember.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Huh?  Tell that to Dow-Corning.  I haven't researched it completely,
<BR>
but my impression is that the scientific evidence found silicone
<BR>
breast implants harmless and they still lost a big chunk of the
<BR>
company.  What happened to all of the asbestos manufacturing
<BR>
companies? (Even though they didn't know they were producing
<BR>
a harmful product until dozens of years later.)  And let us not
<BR>
forget the tobacco manufacturers.  I will grant that in some
<BR>
cases it may be difficult to prove &quot;liability&quot;, but it does
<BR>
seem to me that the legal system is getting better in this
<BR>
regard.  Its going to be quite interesting to see if the
<BR>
&quot;limited liability&quot; claims of closed-source software vendors
<BR>
hold up in the long run.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Given the situation, why is this un-extropian?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing un-extropian that I can see, the paternalistic attitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;We know better than you&quot; is un-extropian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If that were the problem, I would agree, but I don't think it is.
<BR>
The problem is the sales job that has been done on John Q. Public
<BR>
that if &quot;green&quot; is good, &quot;more green&quot; is better.  Unfortunately
<BR>
things like the Delaney clause (regulating the exposure to
<BR>
substances that might cause cancer) and the &quot;public's impression&quot;
<BR>
is that of &quot;zero tolerance&quot;.  The problem is that to get toxins,
<BR>
carcinogens, etc. to the level of &quot;zero&quot;, when our detection
<BR>
capabilities are now up in the parts-per-billion level, means
<BR>
that our food, water, etc. will get very expensive.  Its
<BR>
unscientific because you have 30+ genes in your liver designed
<BR>
to do nothing but get rid of toxins *normally* found in your
<BR>
diet (now-a-days they do more work metabolizing drugs).
<BR>
So long as you do not exceed the detoxification capacity of
<BR>
those genes, you probably have minimal health effects.
<BR>
<P>The two greatest &quot;controllable&quot; health risks experienced by the
<BR>
average individual are tobacco smoke and alcohol.  Everything
<BR>
else is orders of magnitude less significant.  If the greens
<BR>
were really concerned about improving health they would start
<BR>
with those substances.  Since they aren't, we should assume
<BR>
there is some amount of &quot;religious faith&quot; involved in their
<BR>
approach and listen quite carefully when they lobby for changes
<BR>
in labeling under the disguise of &quot;free speech&quot;.
<BR>
<P>As I mentioned before, I am *not* against complete information being
<BR>
available to the consumer.  It should be available more along the
<BR>
lines of &quot;drug&quot; information, where presumably you have a qualified
<BR>
professional (e.g. nurse, physician, etc.) who can explain to
<BR>
you the terms, risks, benefits, side effects, etc.  In that situation
<BR>
the marketing tactics of the &quot;environmentalist&quot;/&quot;green&quot;/&quot;natural&quot;
<BR>
camp would be clear for all to see.
