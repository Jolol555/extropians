<BR>
Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension Technologies.  www.alcor.org
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 17-18, 2000
<BR>
<P>The world is changing rapidly.  Only a few years ago, most 
<BR>
people considered  mammalian cloning to be no more than 
<BR>
science fiction.   Repeated successes in this area,  however, 
<BR>
have made it a reality today.  More importantly, medical 
<BR>
technologies like cloning and the use of embryonic stem cells 
<BR>
to regenerate tissues, promise to make it possible to reverse all 
<BR>
the major degenerative diseases within our own lifetimes.  
<BR>
Even aging itself is under very heavy attack by today’s 
<BR>
biological and medical technologies.  
<BR>
<P>The Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension 
<BR>
Technologies is a meeting of scientists, technologists and 
<BR>
individuals who are working in fields leading toward the 
<BR>
expansion of human health and longevity.

<P>Glenna Burmer, MD, PhD
<BR>
<P>Title:  Identifying Aging Genes by Using DNA Microarrays
<BR>
<P>DNA Microarrays or &quot;gene chips&quot; are one of the most powerful methods in 
<BR>
biotechnology for simultaneously analyzing the expression of thousands of 
<BR>
human genes in human diseases. LifeSpan is building a database of gene 
<BR>
expression in human aging and the diseases of aging using microarrays and 
<BR>
methods of high throughput localization to find candidates that may be the 
<BR>
drug targets for the treatment of aging diseases. Data will be presented on 
<BR>
genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in aging, those that are drug 
<BR>
targets or potential diagnostic markers, and those for which a function is
<BR>
not yet known, but are clearly aging-associated. The high throughput nature
<BR>
of 
<BR>
this type of technology is changing the way discoveries are being made in 
<BR>
both the field of aging as well as medicine in general.

<BR>
<P>Title: Bioimpedance
<BR>
<P>Bioimpedance, a biological electrical characteristic where tissues with
<BR>
intact 
<BR>
cell membranes behave very differently from tissues that have undergone 
<BR>
cell membrane breakdown, is sustained for extended periods after cessation 
<BR>
of heartbeat and breathing.  Automated means of comparatively evaluating 
<BR>
cryostasis protocols, as well as means for monitoring and comparing specific 
<BR>
cryotransport operations, will be reported in the context of early 
<BR>
experimentation and (if circumstances have permitted) actual cryotransports.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Eric K. Drexler, PhD
<BR>
<P>Title:  The Conservative Treatment of Transient Inviability 
<BR>
or Your computer crashed -- shall I throw it out?
<BR>
<P>Emerging nanotechnologies will lead to cellular-scale robotic surgical 
<BR>
devices able to sense and repair tissues with molecular precision. Those of 
<BR>
us who stay intact until this technology arrives could achieve and keep good 
<BR>
health indefinitely. Traditional 
<BR>
medicine discards patients if their vital processes are interrupted for more 
<BR>
than a few minutes. In light of the prospects for future repair, this
<BR>
treatment -
<BR>
- physical destruction of potentially healthy human beings -- seems 
<BR>
regrettable. Physicians wishing to save lives 
<BR>
should instead recommend treatments that keep patients intact for restoration 
<BR>
using the next generation of medical technologies.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Title: Cryobiological Research at 21st Century Medicine
<BR>
<P>21st Century Medicine is probing a broad range of problems in cryobiology. 
<BR>
A central aspect is our attempt to demonstrate successful cryopreservation of 
<BR>
mammalian organs, particularly the kidney. Construction of perfusion 
<BR>
equipment, new surgical approaches, our new surgical staff, and initial 
<BR>
results of perfusion with novel, low-toxicity vitrification solutions will be 
<BR>
described.
<BR>
<P><P>James J. Hughes, PhD 
<BR>
<P>Title:  Our Evolving Definitions of Death: Looking Ahead
<BR>
<P>The definition of death varies cross-culturally. &quot;Death&quot; has also changed 
<BR>
radically in the West in the last thirty years. The shift from circulation
<BR>
and 
<BR>
respiration-based definitions of death to &quot;whole brain death&quot; has left us
<BR>
in an 
<BR>
unstable compromise. Just as mechanical heart-lung aids forced us from 
<BR>
<P>body to brain, advances in remediation of brain injuries will force us to 
<BR>
grapple with questions about the integrity and continuity of personhood. 
<BR>
Cryonics will be a part of a group of therapeutic modalities that will
<BR>
force a 
<BR>
new personal identity-based concept of rights. The question may shift from 
<BR>
&quot;Live or dead?&quot; to &quot;What can we do with/who controls various kinds of 
<BR>
bodies, with various degrees of consent or prior expressed will on the part
<BR>
of 
<BR>
the occupant?&quot; I will discuss some political and legal scenarios. One 
<BR>
possible outcome might be that the re-animated cryonaut would be a legally 
<BR>
and phenomenologically different person than the person who was frozen.
<BR>
<P><P>Ralph Merkle, PhD
<BR>
<P>Title:   Nanomedicine and Cryostasis
<BR>
<P>Human beings are made from molecules, and how those molecules are 
<BR>
arranged makes the difference between good health and bad, between youth 
<BR>
and old age, and between life and death. Most medical problems involve 
<BR>
damage at the molecular and cellular level. Today's medical tools are very 
<BR>
limited in their ability to deal with such damage. In the future, with 
<BR>
nanotechnology, we should be able to arrange and rearrange molecular 
<BR>
structures in most of the ways permitted by physical law. The medical 
<BR>
applications of such an ability will be remarkable. We should be able to heal 
<BR>
and cure under conditions that today would be considered completely 
<BR>
hopeless. We should even be able to reverse freezing injury, giving us the 
<BR>
ability to restore to health people who have been frozen using today's 
<BR>
methods.

<BR>
<P>Title: Setting Your Internal Clock
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Circadian rhythms are well known scientific phenomenon.  Recently, we 
<BR>
have learned how to reset our internal clocks with diet, exercise, sleep and 
<BR>
hormonal manipulation.  Dr. Morales will discuss some of the breakthroughs 
<BR>
in this area and their application to anti-aging medicine.
<BR>
<P><P>Robert Newport, MD
<BR>
<P>Title: Fear of Death Intereferes with Rational Processes
<BR>
<P><P>In this brief presentation we will try to lay the foundation for 
<BR>
understanding how the 'fear of death' arises and how it interferes 
<BR>
with an individuals rational process, especially in relation to  
<BR>
acting to preserve, extend and possibly, via cryonic suspension, 
<BR>
return to, life. We will draw on the work of Stanislaw Groff MD and 
<BR>
my own personal experience from 30 years of working with depressed 
<BR>
and anxious patients in a private practice of psychiatry. Due to the 
<BR>
brevity of the session, audience participation will be held during 
<BR>
the lunch break. We will also review current research on the effects 
<BR>
of stress on early brain development.  
<BR>

&nbsp;
<BR>
Title: Gene Expression Profile of the Aging Process 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The gene expression profile of the aging process was analyzed in skeletal 
<BR>
muscle of mice. Use of high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing 6347 
<BR>
genes revealed that aging resulted in a differential gene expression pattern 
<BR>
indicative of a marked stress response and lower expression of metabolic and 
<BR>
biosynthetic genes. Most alterations were either completely or partially 
<BR>
prevented by caloric restriction, the only intervention known to retard aging 
<BR>
in mammals. Transcriptional patterns of calorie-restricted animals suggest 
<BR>
that caloric restriction retards the aging process by causing a metabolic
<BR>
shift 
<BR>
toward increased protein turnover and decreased macromolecular damage. 
<BR>
Gene expression profiling of the aging process provides a new tool to test 
<BR>
aging interventions.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Gregory Stock, PhD
<BR>
<P>Title:  Who's afraid of freezer burn?
<BR>
<P>Long before biological reconstruction of a frozen body (or brain) could be 
<BR>
feasible, technology would have to advance sufficiently for uploading to 
<BR>
occur.  Moreover, the technological developments needed even for 
<BR>
uploading are sufficiently powerful to dramatically transform the world in a 
<BR>
way that would make biology a far less interesting substrate for life than 
<BR>
silicon and its progeny. The incentives for a biological rather than a 
<BR>
technological awakening from a cryonic state are unlikely ever to exist, so 
<BR>
cryonists -- if they are someday revived -- are almost certainly bidding
<BR>
adieu 
<BR>
to corporeal existence.

<BR>
<P>An after dinner presentation by Natasha Vita-More on her current book project
<BR>
&nbsp;followed by a panel discussion. 
<BR>
<P>A Talent for Living: Cracking the Myths of Mortality.  Many have written about
<BR>
the technologies of extending life but not why we would want to live longer. 
<BR>
There is an art to living - how we maintain our well being and how we bring 
<BR>
aesthetics into our lives.  We can approach life merely as a series of events 
<BR>
or as a creative and challenging exploration. The panel will examine the 
<BR>
cultural myths preventing mainstream acceptance of extreme life extension 
<BR>
and discuss how to crack them. 
<BR>
<P><P>Michael West, PhD
<BR>
<P>Title: Human Therapeutic Cloning
<BR>
<P>Many technologies have been developed and refined in the past few years 
<BR>
that set the stage for human therapeutic cloning as a potentially limitless 
<BR>
source of cells for tissue engineering and transplantation medicine. These 
<BR>
technologies include the identification and isolation of pluripotent stem
<BR>
cells 
<BR>
that are capable of generating all of the cell types in the body, genetic and 
<BR>
cell engineering techniques enabling the designee of custom 
<BR>
tissues and organs, and advanced in somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone 
<BR>
ungulates confluence of these technologies will lead to means for developing 
<BR>
tissue therapies that will overcome the present difficulties related to
<BR>
immune 
<BR>
compatibility and graft rejection, and thus the requirements for use of 
<BR>
immunosuppressive drugs and/or mmunomodulatory protocols.
<BR>
<P><P>Brian Wowk, PhD 
<BR>
<P>Title: Molecular Control of Ice Formation
<BR>
<P>Antifreeze proteins and ice nucleating proteins found in nature are able to 
<BR>
respectively prevent or catalyze the formation of ice while present in very 
<BR>
small quantities. It has recently been demonstrated that synthetic molecules 
<BR>
are able to perform similar functions. The availability of inexpensive 
<BR>
synthetic molecules for blocking ice formation opens new frontiers for 
<BR>
control of ice in industry and agriculture, and for eliminating ice in 
<BR>
cryopreservation applications.
