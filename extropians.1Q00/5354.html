<EM>&gt; Briefly, Moravec in Mind Children (1988) suggests the computing power of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neutron star be used to re-simulate all of earth's history down to this very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moment. Tipler believes that intelligent Life (robotic) will over-take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Big Bang and collapse the cosmos into 2 physical dimensions; designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perpetuate and re-emulate the totality of life.  Tegmark, very popular on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list, and the Everything List, proposes that an ensamble of universes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of which contain you and I. In some of these, there are or will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versions of us that will transcend mortality by simply living billions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What seems to be missing from all three scholars is follow-through. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't seem to be any  fringe academia even to continue these hypothesis. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that these ideas need refinement.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe that's because these ideas are a load of crap. There's no way that the
<BR>
re-simulation idea would reproduce &quot;me&quot; if I had died. Not unless we are talking
<BR>
time travel to retrieve my pattern before it turns to mush. There is an
<BR>
experiment where a single photon is sent through a slit interference setup and
<BR>
though there shouldn't be multiple lines (not enough photons) there are, this is
<BR>
highly suggestive that there are parallel universes or dimensions. If there is a
<BR>
me in those he is no more &quot;me&quot; than my clone would be. Take over the big bang?
<BR>
Geez these guys need a big dose of common sense.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong. I too dream of somehow bringing back all those that have not
<BR>
been fortunate enough to live in this time of possibilities. Possibilities which
<BR>
may lead to immortality. We need something more real than simulations in my
<BR>
opinion.
