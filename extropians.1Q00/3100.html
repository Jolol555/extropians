<EM>&gt;I was kicked out of Sunday School once for asking difficult questions.  Now 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've been kicked off the Extropian list also.  (heh heh)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's funny, and familiar.  I didn't get kicked out of bible study, but was asked very politely not to ask questions that the other students were not ready to hear the answers to yet. I guess the priest running the bible study wasn't prepared for an 11 year old that had read the bible cover to cover.
<BR>
<P>I was raised Episcopalian(catholic lite)which seems to me to be the most harmless of religions.
<BR>
<P>q:Why don't Episcopalians have confession?
<BR>
<P>A: Wasn't there, Didn't do it, Have an alibi ;)
