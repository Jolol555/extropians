<P>
At this point, I'd rate the system in place as pretty good against
<BR>
privacy problems at the level of, say, the recent DoubleClick debacle. 
<BR>
<P>I understand that their system doesn't work and play well through a real
<BR>
firewall, because their PC-resident code  pretends to be one. 
<BR>
<P>As was mentioned, the white paper lists a series of weaknesses and
<BR>
limitations of the current implementation.
<BR>
<P>All that said, I sent them money just to stir the pot.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And now: Questions, questions...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [0]      Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc. seems to be Canada based.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;          Does the Canadian government allow it to sell &quot;sophisticated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;          cryptography&quot; to non-US countries?  If not, the Freedom software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;          would become less interesting, wouldn't you say?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that Canada is pretty liberal about crypto exports.  And of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course the US has recently relaxed their regulations as well.  So at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point the export restrictions are becoming much less of an issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [1]      Can one trust their Freedom Network[tm]?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know several of the people involved with this project.  They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; committed cypherpunks from way back, and technically very strong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The company has been good about providing white papers explaining the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, and they even have a whole paper full of nothing but attacks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The system isn't perfect, and some of the features aren't done yet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but once it is fully operational it should be very strong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [2]      How can one be sure that ZKSI does not collect the data one sends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;          through their software, unless one gets the program source?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They have made indications about going to some kind of open source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model, or at least releasing the source for review.  Supposedly they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a Linux project going as well (currently it is only for Win 95/98).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This should help add confidence to the system.
</EM><BR>
