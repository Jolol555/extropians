<EM> &gt; If all advanced space faring races have avoided interfering with the natural

</EM><BR>
<P>If space faring civilisations exist, they must tread terribly
<BR>
lightly/be nonexpansive. 
<BR>
<P>This makes no sense at all.
<BR>
<P>Due to (postbiological) evolutionary species radiation you must have
<BR>
heterogeneity, even if you have to pass through a diversity bottleneck
<BR>
(e.g. step into space), and hence there is evolutionary pressure to
<BR>
fill new niches, whether ultracold (inter) stellar periphery or inner
<BR>
solar systems.
<BR>
<P>Nonsentient systems can be capable of interstellar travel and
<BR>
autoreplication. (Though intelligence is probably a necessary initial
<BR>
condition for emergence of any brawny spacefaring life).
<BR>
<P>I can only be moral if I'm sentient (and even then this is necessary
<BR>
but not sufficient. Morality is an artefact of iterated interaction
<BR>
among more or less equal partners).
<BR>
<P>Hence no starfaring culture (or even a population of starfaring
<BR>
cultures) can remain nonexpansive and hence nonobservable over any
<BR>
relevant time spans.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; latent potential realized then would they act to prevent natural disasters,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; such as earth-asteriod collisions, in order to preserve that potential?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Evidently, if such advanced races exist, they don't care much about life as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they certainly did not intervene during near fatal earth-asteriod collisions
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the past. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Occam's razor says they don't exist (or are not
<BR>
observable/noninteracting, which means exactly the same thing).
<BR>
<P>Solar system screened for planets so far seem to indicate our
<BR>
particular system is pretty special. With better instrumentation
<BR>
(e.g. space based large-aperture ultra-lage baseline optical
<BR>
interferometry) we might make our data set more exhaustive, and even
<BR>
look for spectroscopic life signatures (nonequilibrium) in our stellar
<BR>
neighbourhood (photons bounced of small planets in life belt are
<BR>
awfully scarce). My guess is also that the rate of nucleonic synthesis
<BR>
is making observations over distances more than 200-500 Mlightyears
<BR>
too stale. Civilisation nucleation rate is probably very low
<BR>
intrinsincally because proper planetary systems (chemistry, location,
<BR>
long-term orbit stability) and early hatching rate as well (isotopic
<BR>
abundancy has to be right). Things should have sped up by now, but
<BR>
we're limited to our local galactic group for fresh data.
