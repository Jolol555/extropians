<P>&lt;&lt; The Fox channel just ran a program on cryonics that had Brin in

That's OK, Spike.
<BR>
There are a lot of skeptics about Cryonics, even amongst extropians.
<BR>
I for one don't subscribe. I am more than a &quot;bit&quot; negative. I think it's not 
<BR>
feasible. Actually, I am not being negative. I am being true to my self. To 
<BR>
reason as I see it. 
<BR>
<P>For a lot of reasons i think it's not going to work, at least not how we are 
<BR>
freezing corpsicles today. Not to mention my concern about the organizations 
<BR>
themselves lasting as long as the Dead Dwellers' Dewers. 
<BR>
<P>Still I have considered (though as yet decided against) signing up, just to 
<BR>
fund researching reanimation. Better, if I was richer, I'd fund research for 
<BR>
a cure for aging and death itself. Even better, get a personal trainer and 
<BR>
get my heart in the best shape it could be.. damn, anyone want to buy some 
<BR>
extropic art?
<BR>
<P>Anyway...
<BR>
The important thing is: superlongevity and the hope of finding a cure for 
<BR>
death is getting airplay.  Nano is getting airplay. Natasha and Max are being 
<BR>
interviewed. Ralph is being interviewed. 
<BR>
<P>The sad thing is that these same dumb networks who display all kinds of 
<BR>
healthy skepticism for techno tend to promote (without a shred of evidence)  
<BR>
all kinds of Uri Geller, afterlife,  X files claptrap      ..ostensibly to 
<BR>
get ratings.... damn!
