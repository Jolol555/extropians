</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert, thank you for putting so well into words the value of religion in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human lives.  You can say things so much better then I can.  Religion can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a healthy and powerful structure to achieve mental discipline and try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reach out to something greater then oneself.  It can be toxic though if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misapplied, as even Christian therapists will say in books like &quot;Toxic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Faith&quot; which can be found at your local Christian bookseller.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see the point Zero and others make about the dangers of scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research being slowed or stopped by fundamentalists (of all types and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stripes)...
</EM><BR>
<P>This works both ways; one would hope that intelligent scientists
<BR>
would exercise sensitivity and restraint in their ordinary contacts
<BR>
with non-scientists whose lives are enriched by the guidance and
<BR>
wisdom found in their scriptures (I have a friend who is a genuine
<BR>
Zoroastrian, for example). Even when scientists are convinced that
<BR>
there isn't the slightest possibility of a particular existential propo-
<BR>
sition by a devotee being physically true, it is not required that this
<BR>
be vocalized.
<BR>
<P>An example: in marriage counseling a husband with a puritanical
<BR>
upbringing cannot achieve sexual compatibility with his wife due
<BR>
to shame, guilt, shyness -- just can't let nature take its course
<BR>
without inhibition. The therapist will always be very careful to
<BR>
provide information requested by the husband that is adequate
<BR>
for a specific question -- BUT NEVER MORE. The therapist will
<BR>
let the husband decide WHEN he is ready for sexual facts that
<BR>
would currently embarrass or shock him.
<BR>
<P>If scientists are really sincere about their desire for the social
<BR>
acceptance and support of science, they could learn some
<BR>
effective new behavior from spending some time studying how
<BR>
successful professionals elicit sympathy and support for their
<BR>
projects and missions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suppose I am one of the few actual believers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in God and an afterlife on this list.
</EM><BR>
<P>You raise an interesting point here: those of us who were
<BR>
trained in engineering, technology, physical or other types
<BR>
of science, were conditioned to ignore the distractions of
<BR>
value-judgments or evidently groundless assumptions. You
<BR>
are drilled to GET THE FACTS, get the data, you've got to
<BR>
get the DATA!  And this is how they earn a living for them-
<BR>
selves and their families.  When you are TRAINED to ignore
<BR>
something, you will become ignorant of it--period.
<BR>
<P>My point: many of my scientific friends don't really KNOW
<BR>
how they think or feel about the &quot;God Proposition&quot;; even
<BR>
if their core-gestalt includes an unconscious belief in a
<BR>
Supreme Being, they depend on it for mental health but
<BR>
they don't KNOW anything about it. This is a commonplace
<BR>
which all mental health workers are familiar with. Stress
<BR>
frustration and failure can alter the scientist's conscious
<BR>
standpoint in a flash.  His mind will do what is necessary
<BR>
to ensure his sanity and survival.
