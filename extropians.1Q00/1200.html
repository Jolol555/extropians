<EM>&gt; Spike my friend, what planet do you live on? :)
</EM><BR>
<P>I often wonder that myself.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, religion, emotions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and hormones can be positive forces at in causing couples to want to bring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; children into the world and nurture them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, what I had in mind was to block the parenthood emotions while the
<BR>
*decision* was being made to do or not do parenthood.  After the
<BR>
decision is made, then the parents would stop using the hormone
<BR>
blockers.  This would allow all those humans nurturing emotions to kick in
<BR>
that have proven so effective in the survival of our species, by preventing
<BR>
parents from fleeing away from the shrieking wretches they brought into
<BR>
this previously quiet world.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But I'm sure that Vulcan parents would quite agree with you, at least before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pon farr kicked in!
</EM><BR>
<P>Pon farr?  Was that the time Spock got horny and nearly slew Kirk?  Or
<BR>
was it the time Jethro back at the double wide parked his pickup next
<BR>
to the waterhole and diesel fuel leaked out onto the surface and ignited? {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To have a world where every child is loved, have everyone be genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered to be sterile until they consider themselves ready.
</EM><BR>
<P>Im with ya there, bud.  In my ideal world, *every person* has complete
<BR>
power to veto the creation of a new human life with their genetic material.
<BR>
It would still take two to say yes, but any one person can say no.  Thats
<BR>
the ideal.  spike
