</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With scanning, in its various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementations, you have the problem of potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss of important information, as well as that pesky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem of whether your consciousness will also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfer when your scan comes on-line, and if not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then where is your consciousness going to end up, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original body, or your uploaded data?
</EM><BR>
<P>You're sounding like a dualist here.  Consciousness is not some magic thing
<BR>
which floats around waiting to be embodied in one brain or another.  It is a
<BR>
result, in your current organic brain, of a set of neurons performing some
<BR>
operation.  Both your scanned brain and the new non-original brain, if they
<BR>
meet the right conditions (that is, perform the right operations), will
<BR>
produce consciousness.
<BR>
<P>The real problem (which you might have been referring to) is the notion that
<BR>
we want our consciousness to feel continuous during the upload procedure.
<BR>
So that you feel like you have actively migrated to the upload computer, not
<BR>
like you're still sitting in the operating room watching your new copy run
<BR>
off having a great time.  The soft slow replacement method that Mike
<BR>
mentioned would appear to give us the former.  A scan of some sort would
<BR>
seem to result in the latter.
<BR>
<P>The problem, though, is this: does it matter at all.  If a brain is scanned
<BR>
and the process which is consciousness is the same in both brains then both
<BR>
will consider themselves to be the same identity.  Both will claim to have
<BR>
been (and one will claim to still be) in the original body.
<BR>
<P>The one in the original body really can only say that his instantiation has
<BR>
no causal relationship to the new one and therefore his awareness never
<BR>
migrated.  Scanning does not constitute a causal relationship because it
<BR>
requires no involvement of the actual process of consciousness.  He might go
<BR>
on to say that having multiple instantiations does not imply that all
<BR>
instantiations have the same status.  One might have been running for twenty
<BR>
years as a human brain; another might have been running for five minutes
<BR>
after an upload procedure.
<BR>
<P>But this is immaterial; a process is a process, regardless of where in its
<BR>
lifetime it is started and for how long it has been running.  This reminds
<BR>
me of the philosophy of mind notion of intensionality, which I never
<BR>
accepted as it seems to claim that past causal relationship has something
<BR>
important to do with current process.
<BR>
<P>As far as I can tell it seems that the way to feel that your awareness is
<BR>
continuous is to use a replacement method.
