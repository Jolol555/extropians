<P>
Are you an Internet Addict? You know you Live Online when...
<BR>
<P>You have worn out all the letters on your keyboard.
<BR>
<P>Wife calls you to dinner by posting to alt.food.
<BR>
<P>I.V. stand next to your mini tower.
<BR>
<P>Choice between paying Compuserve bill and paying for kids' education is
<BR>
easy--if a little painful for your kids.
<BR>
<P>Your big pickup line is, &quot;Haven't we chatted together online before?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Batteries in the TV remote now last for months.
<BR>
<P>You hire a housekeeper for your home page.
<BR>
<P>New mail alarm on your palmtop annoys other churchgoers.
<BR>
<P>Your mouse-clicking forearm rivals Popeye's.
<BR>
<P>Your ISP names you Customer of the Month for the third consecutive time.
<BR>
<P>You unsuccessfully try to download pizza from www.dominos.com.
<BR>
<P>Your family conducts an intervention via e-mail and checks you into
<BR>
www.bettyford.com.
<BR>
<P>You rig your toilet to alert you if you receive any new mail while you're
<BR>
&quot;offline.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You're surprised to learn there's also a 2 o'clock in the *afternoon*.
<BR>
<P>You actually wore a blue ribbon to protest the Communications Decency Act.
<BR>
<P>You kiss your girlfriend's home page.
<BR>
<P>Your bookmark list takes 15 minutes to scroll from top to bottom.
<BR>
<P>Your eyeglasses have a web site burned into them.
<BR>
<P>You find yourself brainstorming for new subjects to search.
<BR>
<P>You refuse to go to a vacation spot with no electricity and no phone lines.
<BR>
<P>You finally do take that vacation, but only after buying a cellular modem
<BR>
and a laptop.
<BR>
<P>You spend half of the plane trip with your laptop on your lap...and your
<BR>
child in the overhead compartment.
<BR>
<P>All your daydreaming is preoccupied with getting a faster connection to the
<BR>
net: 28.8...ISDN...cable modem...T1...T3.
<BR>
<P>You dream in HTML if you're a web programmer.
<BR>
<P>You find yourself typing &quot;com&quot; after every period when using a word
<BR>
processor.com
<BR>
<P>You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, like you just
<BR>
pulled the plug on a loved one.
<BR>
<P>You refer to going to the bathroom as downloading.
<BR>
<P>You start introducing yourself as &quot;John at I-I-Net dot net dot.com&quot;
<BR>
<P>Your heart races faster and beats irregularly each time you see a new WWW
<BR>
site address in print or on TV, even though you've never had heart problems
<BR>
before.
<BR>
<P>You step out of your room and realize that your parents have moved and you
<BR>
don't have a clue when it happened.
<BR>
<P>You turn on your intercom when leaving the room so you can hear if new
<BR>
e-mail arrives.
<BR>
<P>Your wife drapes a blond wig over your monitor to remind you of what she
<BR>
looks like.
<BR>
<P>When looking at a pageful of someone else's links, you notice all of them
<BR>
are already highlighted in purple.
<BR>
<P>Your dog has its own home page.
<BR>
<P>You've already visited all the links at Yahoo and you're halfway through
<BR>
Lycos.
<BR>
<P>You can't call your mother...she doesn't have a modem.
<BR>
<P>You realize there is not a sound in the house and you have no idea where
<BR>
your children are.
<BR>
<P>You believe nothing looks sexier than a man in boxer shorts illuminated only
<BR>
by a 17&quot; inch svga monitor.
<BR>
<P>You check your mail. It says &quot;no new messages.&quot; So you check it again.
<BR>
<P>You refer to your age as 3.x.
<BR>
<P>You have comandeered your teenager's phone line for the net and even his
<BR>
friends know not to call on his line anymore.
<BR>
<P>Your phone bill comes to your doorstep in a box.
<BR>
<P>Even though you died last week, you've managed to retain OPS on your
<BR>
favorite IRC channel.
<BR>
<P>You code your homework in HTML and give your instructor the URL.
<BR>
<P>You don't know what sex over three of your closest friends are, because they
<BR>
have neutral nicknames and you never bothered to ask.
<BR>
<P>You name your children Eudora, Mozilla and Dotcom.
<BR>
<P>Your husband tells you he's had the beard for 2 months.
<BR>
<P>You miss more than five meals a week downloading the latest games from
<BR>
Apogee.
<BR>
<P>You start looking for hot HTML addresses in public restrooms.
<BR>
<P>You wake up at 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom and stop and check your e-mail
<BR>
on the way back to bed.
<BR>
<P>You move into a new house and decide to Netscape before you landscape.
<BR>
<P>You tell the cab driver you live at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://123.elm.street/house/bluetrim.html">http://123.elm.street/house/bluetrim.html</A>
<BR>
<P>You actually look up the 123.elm.street web address after you gave it to the
<BR>
cab driver.
<BR>
<P>Your virtual girlfriend finds a new net sweetheart with a larger bandwidth.
<BR>
<P>You tell the kids they can't use the computer because &quot;Daddy's got work to
<BR>
do&quot; and you don't even have a job.
<BR>
<P>Your friends no longer send you e-mail...they just log on to your IRC
<BR>
channel.
<BR>
<P>You buy a Captain Kirk chair with a built-in keyboard and mouse.
<BR>
<P>Your wife makes a new rule: &quot;The computer cannot come to bed.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You are so familiar with the WWW that you find the search engines useless.
<BR>
<P>You get a tattoo that says &quot;This body best viewed with Netscape 4.0 or
<BR>
higher.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You never have to deal with busy signals when calling your ISP...because you
<BR>
never log off.
<BR>
<P>The last girl you picked up was a jpeg.
<BR>
<P>You put a pillow case over your laptop so your lover doesn't see it while
<BR>
you are pretending to catch your breath.
<BR>
<P>You ask a plumber how much it would cost to replace the chair in front of
<BR>
your computer with a toilet.
<BR>
<P>You forget what year it is.
<BR>
<P>You start tilting your head sideways to smile.
<BR>
<P>You ask your doctor to implant a gig in your brain.
<BR>
<P>You leave the modem speaker on after connecting because you think it sounds
<BR>
like the ocean wind...the perfect soundtrack for &quot;surfing the net&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You begin to wonder how on earth your service provider is allowed to call
<BR>
200 hours per month &quot;unlimited.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You turn on your computer and turn off your wife.
<BR>
<P>Your wife says communication is important in a marriage...so you buy another
<BR>
computer and install a second phone line so the two of you can chat.
<BR>
<P>As your car crashes through the guardrail on a mountain road, your first
<BR>
instinct is to search for the &quot;back&quot; button.
<BR>
<P>The remote to the T.V. is missing...and you don't even care.
<BR>
<P>The last time you looked at the clock it was 11:30pm, and in what seems like
<BR>
only a few seconds later, your sister runs past you to catch her 7am school
<BR>
bus.
<BR>
<P>You create a homepage with the impression to cure the afflicted...but your
<BR>
hidden agenda is to receive more e-mail.
<BR>
<P>Your hard drive crashes. You haven't logged on in two hours. You start to
<BR>
twitch. You pick up the phone and manually dial your ISPs access number. You
<BR>
try to hum to communicate with it. You succeed.
<BR>
<P>(GUILTY!!)
