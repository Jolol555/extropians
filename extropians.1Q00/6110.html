<P>Hello all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I've watched this thread with delight. SNR here had strayed to low
<BR>
levels before this. Most proposals for Mr. Brin seem to fall into one
<BR>
of three categories: (a) space migration, (b) increasing
<BR>
intelligence, and (c) life extension. The generally pessimistic tone
<BR>
about space migration discourages me, but I suspect most here hope
<BR>
advancing technology will ease surface-to-orbit travel. Increasing
<BR>
intelligence also includes such items as web enhancement, inexpensive
<BR>
computing, superior educational methods, and so on. Life extension,
<BR>
IMO, covers not only immortality but also quality of life. This
<BR>
requires a healthy ecosystem and general prosperity and security.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I suggest that a small fraction of the immense wealth Mr. Brin
<BR>
identifies see use to encourage the habit of philanthropy. Eighteen
<BR>
trillion dollars takes many people's inheritances and lumps them
<BR>
together, but charity remains an individual decision. A financial
<BR>
instrument as popular as today's mutual funds, perhaps with tax
<BR>
benefits, designed to encourage long-term charitable giving would
<BR>
serve society very well. Surveying existing instruments and services
<BR>
for their benefits and limitations would have to come first. Next,
<BR>
(re)designing a service according to the expected customer's values
<BR>
would have to happen. Third, such services and products would need to
<BR>
be advertised.  It is all well and good to target the wealthy, but
<BR>
far more $10,000 mutual fund accounts exist than $10,000,000
<BR>
accounts.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Finally, while I'd like to see many things here on the list: a
<BR>
moonbase, Zubrin's Case For Mars prizes, better internet access,
<BR>
X-Prize funding, etc., let me make my pet idea public. A few million
<BR>
dollars for effective water-soluble nootropics suitable for
<BR>
supplementing public-water supplies would please me. Of course, it's
<BR>
hard to counteract the trend of water filters and bottled water here
<BR>
in USA. Perhaps such a program could help comprise a general public
<BR>
water-works upgrade.
<BR>
