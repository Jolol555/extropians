</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as it relates to political theory.  The political discussions on this

<P>If you want to be really theoretical, I've always been partial to
<BR>
constitutional design.  You can easily come up with all kinds of
<BR>
arrangements that are radically different from anything that is actually
<BR>
being used, and its fun to try to figure out how to solve all the problems
<BR>
that have surfaced since the more prominent constitutions were enacted.
<BR>
<P>If you need something a little more down to Earth, how about:
<BR>
1) The problem of Constitutional enforcement.  It is patently obvious that
<BR>
the manner in which the U.S. Constitution is currently interpreted bears
<BR>
only a very tenuous relationship with its original meaning.  How can this
<BR>
process of 'Constitutional drift' be minimized over time?  Or, how can we
<BR>
force interest groups to lobby for Constitutional amendments instead of for
<BR>
judicial re-interpretation?
<BR>
<P>2) The two-party problem.  The U.S. system has become more and more hostile
<BR>
to independent candidates and new political parties over the decades, as the
<BR>
major parties pass laws aimed at keeping out competition.  What can a free
<BR>
society do to prevent becoming 'locked in' to a fixed party structure in
<BR>
this fashion?
