'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;This might not seem like a lot of work, but we don't have a computer today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that's capable of detecting anything you list in (2) without a human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pre-analyzing the data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I never said the system should or could be implemented &quot;today.&quot;  AI could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very well solve this problem.  Even so, I don't think it would really be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that difficult to solve even with today's technology.  My list of sworn 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enemies would be finite (quite small actually).  You could do it with sets 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of software agents.  One agent assigned to follow each of the enemies on my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list.  When any one enemy did one of the trigger events, the agent merely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reports back.  Would that really be so difficult to engineer?  I don't think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;sigh&gt;  YES.  REALLY.  Take my word for it for chrissake.  :)  A list of
<BR>
enemies will not suffice: you have to figure out how to write down the
<BR>
function that takes grids of numbers and spits out a 1 if it's a picture
<BR>
of one of the enemies on your list and a 0 otherwise.  This is a very
<BR>
complicated function which nobody can write down today.
<BR>
<P>Using AIs here is the application of a magic genie that will solve all
<BR>
your computational problems.  A genie like that might not WANT to solve
<BR>
all our problems; it might just decide to do its own thing or figure out
<BR>
the meaning of life or what have you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the problem is that you are thinking of the system as &quot;the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer.&quot;  Sure it would have to be one *massively* parallel box to handle 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all those requests and all that data.  But guess what?  Coming soon to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet under you will be a distributed network of intelligent devices of all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds.  Think intelligent, networked, and communicating observation and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reporting hardware devices, think innumerable software agents all reporting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to you according to your instructions, think distributed networked 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computing, think &quot;system&quot; as opposed to &quot;the computer&quot; and it should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to grasp.
</EM><BR>
<P>Doesn't matter.  Put emphasis on the &quot;massive&quot; and you see what I'm
<BR>
getting at.
