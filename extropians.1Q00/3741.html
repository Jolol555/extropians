<EM>&gt; my parents seem to think that if they get one I'll

<EM>&gt; just spend more time on the  computer...they're right,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of course, but they just don't get the concept of why....[snip]

<P>So, Oh Squire of the Lightspeed Era, thou doth seekest
<BR>
to elevate oneself to Knighthood?  One must ask the King
<BR>
and Queen, &quot;Oh what is reality, but that which one
<BR>
perceives in one's brain?&quot; and &quot;If reality is nothing but
<BR>
perception, how can one person's reality haveth any more
<BR>
weight than anothers?&quot; and &quot;Doth they desire the reality of
<BR>
yesteryear to be the reality of nowyear?&quot;.  Ask them,
<BR>
&quot;Would they not desireth to return to the BlackNWhiteTV Era?&quot;...
<BR>
<P>If they answer yea, then one had best go get a job, purchase a
<BR>
satellite dish and barricade oneself behind the bedroom door.
<BR>
For one would not wish to bear witness to the carnage wrought by
<BR>
the singularity whirlpool as is sucks such individuals from
<BR>
this reality into that which nevermore shall be.
<BR>
<P>Or, if one desireth to be more diplomatic, one could point out
<BR>
that its the computer geeks that are making millions in IPOs
<BR>
and buying their parents vacation homes in the Virgin Islands.
