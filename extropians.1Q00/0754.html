<P><EM>&gt; I.e., calling a theory X 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  'true' does not say we cease having doubts about theory X&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure it does, that is what &quot;true&quot; means and that is the problem . . . because 
<BR>
it _mutates the meme_ (and concept definition) &quot;true&quot; far out beyond a 
<BR>
Popperian non-dogma of critical rationalism and the evolutionary epistemology 
<BR>
of comprehensively critical rationalism.  It is unnescessarily confusing in 
<BR>
science.  Now we will have to define (re-define) that we really don't mean 
<BR>
&quot;true&quot; in the everyday sense?  I don not think that is wise.  Better to 
<BR>
simply not call theories true, avoid that use of the misleading concept 
<BR>
re-definition.  
<BR>
<P>Make up a new word for this concept or call them &quot;survivors.&quot;  Call them 
<BR>
anything BUT &quot;true.&quot;  Lets not confuse the issue by using inflammatory 
<BR>
word-concepts like &quot;true&quot;  or &quot;fact&quot; or &quot;truth.&quot;   That is what the 
<BR>
fundumentalists religions do.  
<BR>
<P>The word concept &quot;fact&quot; is just as bad.   Here is some of what I wrote on 
<BR>
this subject:
<BR>
<P>In an article entitled:  &quot;Kansas and Evolution As Fact: The Scientist's 
<BR>
Error&quot; I said:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Carl Sagan, unfortunately, proved to be an example, when he said that 
<BR>
evolution was not a theory: 'Evolution is not a theory, it is a fact,' in his 
<BR>
corporation for public broadcasting television program _Cosmos_.  That was a 
<BR>
dangerously dogmatic thing to say.  The show, _Cosmos_, was his popular 
<BR>
science series and perhaps he really did not mean to make such an 
<BR>
unscientific and emotional statement.  He was frustrated with irrational 
<BR>
religious dogma of the creationists.  He should have known better, but he 
<BR>
chose to fight dogma, with dogma -- but that was not a good strategy.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>&quot; . . . the evolution-as-fact, argument is 1) a matter of personal opinion, 
<BR>
2) an irrational faith in the scientific method, 3) is a matter of 
<BR>
interpretation of evidence by inductive not deductive reasoning, 4) 
<BR>
circumvents science's open mindedness of such philosophies as pancritical 
<BR>
rationalism.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;A theory by definition, is an explanation for a group of facts, not a fact 
<BR>
itself.  Neither is it &quot;true&quot; because every theory changes, that is, theories 
<BR>
&quot;evolve&quot; -- they are not static and do not meet the definition of a static or 
<BR>
final &quot;truth.&quot;
