<P>
At the risk of wasting bandwidth or extropian synaptic cycles, let me add a
<BR>
bit more.
<BR>
<P>Damien wrote:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff, since that `in turn' does seem to support
<BR>
Robert's reading.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Whoops!  Seems I've messed up again.  Wrote poorly.  Miscommunicated.
<BR>
<P>Let me clear it up.
<BR>
<P>I said: &quot; Robert and Ralph have got it right...&quot;, by which I meant their
<BR>
vision is unexcelled.
<BR>
<P>Then I wrote, &quot;... --end of story.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Which is ME being the bluntly confident one.  (They, Robert and Ralph, seem
<BR>
to me to be confident as well, perhaps even &quot;bluntly&quot; confident, but in
<BR>
this instance, I am not suggesting that it is they who are blunt, nor
<BR>
should anyone hold them responsible for bluntness, excessive or otherwise,
<BR>
on the basis of my report.  They are--seems to me-- &quot;confident&quot;; I are, on
<BR>
the semi-unimpeachable authority of knowing my own mind, &quot;blunt&quot;.  Just
<BR>
call me Mr. Blunt, or The Blunt One. )
<BR>
<P>Then I wrote, &quot;I realize that such blunt confidence is off-putting to some,
<BR>
and rationally insupportable to others, often outrageously so.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Which sentence was followed immediately by:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Yet I, in turn, consider *their* analysis feeble, and *their* vision puny.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It was my intention to have the pronouns *their* above, refer back to the
<BR>
&quot;some&quot; and &quot;others&quot; who may find my &quot;blunt confidence&quot; off-putting or
<BR>
rationally insupportable.
<BR>
<P>I was thinking that this same 'they', in THEIR turn, consider my blunt
<BR>
confidence yadda yadda, then I, in MY turn, consider their analysis and
<BR>
vision yadda yadda.  But if the expertise of highly-respected thinker,
<BR>
author, and futurist visionary Damien Broderick carries any weight--and it
<BR>
does with this apprentice wordsmith--then it seems I got tripped up by the
<BR>
'in turn' thing, which--mea culpa, mea culpa, mea minima culpa--was
<BR>
ill-chosen for its intended purpose.
<BR>
<P>Which is to say that I, The Blunt One, find thinking easy, and writing
<BR>
hard. Whereas those of the feeble analysis and puny vision find thinking
<BR>
hard, and writing,...well, when your analysis is feeble and your vision is
<BR>
puny, the quality of your writing is pretty much irrelevant (unless, of
<BR>
course, it earns you a living, in which case--the bottom line being what it
<BR>
is--writing is everything, and analysis and vision are irrelevant).
<BR>
<P>Summary: 
<BR>
<P>Robert: Excellent, 
<BR>
Ralph: Excellent,
<BR>
Damien:Excellent,
<BR>
Me: Best of All (Draws blinds, dances little dance of self-adulation, while
<BR>
dog, lying before fire, looks on thinking, &quot;What's gotten into him?&quot;)
<BR>
Unenlightened non-extropic others: Who cares!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>As always, to horizons of love, or good luck, or more love.
<BR>
<P>Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was blunt, but clumsy with his antecedents.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
