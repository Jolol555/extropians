<P><EM>&gt; So I puzzled over it for a week, and found no flaw in spike's reasoning,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the earth at the other end is the perigee.  Nifty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeffer, I must explain myself.  I went down that exact line of reasoning
<BR>
when I first posted, then the flaw occurred to me while I was off calcing
<BR>
another nifty idea, so I created a diversion [which resulted in the
<BR>
thread with the unfortunate name english schminglish] to stall for time
<BR>
while I worked out my other idea, then returned to this.  My other
<BR>
idea is working out really cool!  But this one has languished, like my
<BR>
information game notion.  {8-[
<BR>
<P>The problem with the eliptical orbit notion, jumping off the tower
<BR>
at one earth diameter from the surface of the planet is that one's
<BR>
tangential velocity at three planet radii from the one focus is a
<BR>
function of the sidereal rotation rate of the planet.  So I can
<BR>
immediately give you one case where the idea wont work: where
<BR>
the rotation rate of the planet is zero with respect to the stars.
<BR>
[Ignore for just a moment that no isosynchronous tower would
<BR>
be possible under those conditions.]  With zero sidereal motion,
<BR>
one could be 3 radii out [or arbitrarily many radii out] leap off
<BR>
the tower and one would fall straight down, with unfortunate
<BR>
consequences.
<BR>
<P>Another counterexample is if the sidereal rate is really fast, so
<BR>
that isosynchronous altitude is lower than a planet diameter
<BR>
from the surface.  You step off of that and shhhhooooom!
<BR>
You might never be heard from again.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, please be patient with me and I will finish my other
<BR>
still cooler idea, and share it with the group.  Or Doug Jones
<BR>
will carry the ball.
<BR>
<P>In the mean time I have a little gift here for you space cable
<BR>
fans.  Robert B. and I have been offlisting about it.  Its a
<BR>
spreadsheet that calcs the total mass of an isosynchronous
<BR>
space cable as a function of the rotation rate of the planet,
<BR>
the mass of the planet, the material properties orf the cable, etc.
<BR>
I wrote it about 13 yrs ago, then put it in a tech paper in 93.
<BR>
<P>I dont think I can post an enclosure on extropians, so if you
<BR>
are interested in it, offlist me.  spike
