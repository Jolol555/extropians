<P>John, without meaning to throw a wet blanket on your enthusiasm and
<BR>
fully acknowledging Saul and Greg's efforts, I will state quite strongly
<BR>
that progress in the suspension technologies are largely irrelevant
<BR>
(though the spin-offs will make good business investments).  [Yes,
<BR>
Eugene, I know you will disagree with me....]
<BR>
<P>Most cryonicists are working off of the fundamental perspective that
<BR>
was valid 15 years ago, namely you had to freeze your tissue and
<BR>
unfreeze it while sustaining little damage.  If you really really
<BR>
understand nanotech capabilities, that perspective has to shift.
<BR>
The only real question is whether or not the freezing process causes
<BR>
a unrecoverable loss of information.  I would argue that with the
<BR>
information handling capacity and sensing capabilities we can expect
<BR>
to have (in large part due to nanotech) in 20-30 years, will make
<BR>
*any* damage that occurs during freezing largely irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>I get the feeling that most cryonicists are existing in the middle
<BR>
ground currently of wanting to minimize the damage so nanotech
<BR>
has as little as possible to clean up.  That seems really pretty
<BR>
ridiculous however.  Go buy yourself a 1000+ piece 3D jigsaw
<BR>
puzzle and assemble it.  If you work on it long enough (3-4 days)
<BR>
you *will* get it to go together.  I'd argue that nanotech could
<BR>
probably do the reassembly job even after a fair fraction
<BR>
of your brain has been &quot;crushed&quot; (think of the octapus squeezing
<BR>
its brain through very small spaces with no ill effects).
<BR>
So long as you don't physically destroy the information content
<BR>
I cannot see how nanotech would not be able, given enough time,
<BR>
to put things back together.  Hal and many others may believe that
<BR>
freezing destroys some of the information content.  I remain
<BR>
unconvinced.
<BR>
<P>Hot news for the day: IBM announces 3-4 GHz processors should
<BR>
be available in 3-4 years.  I'll simply note that this is
<BR>
more than *DOUBLE* the rate projected in the SIA roadmap!
<BR>
<P>Step by step, the singularity (picture the big Rock Creature
<BR>
from Galaxy Quest) takes huge strides down the Texas highway....
