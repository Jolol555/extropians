Some comments on the comments:
<BR>
<P>As I hope folks are aware, the list I'm compiling is certainly not an 
<BR>
&quot;enemies list&quot; per se, but rather an attempt to put together resources for 
<BR>
monitoring the development of ideas and organizations that have one or more 
<BR>
items of active anti-progress ideology or value in their make-up.  It's also 
<BR>
not officially associated with Extropy Institute in any way - it's just a 
<BR>
personal project of my own.  I'm simply looking to create a set of links to 
<BR>
make monitoring a wide spectrum of groups and movements easier.
<BR>
<P>Regarding &quot;greens&quot;, it pains me particularly to see what's happened to the 
<BR>
&quot;environmental movement&quot;, but the anti-science, anti-technology and 
<BR>
anti-enterprise tendencies of even most mainstream &quot;environmental&quot; groups has 
<BR>
becomes quite clear-cut to me in the last few years, so much so that I've 
<BR>
come to describe myself with the older word &quot;conservationist&quot; so as to avoid 
<BR>
association with the likes of Greenpeace.  Folks who know me well will 
<BR>
realize that this is particularly galling, because I'm more at home outdoors 
<BR>
in the wilderness than in any city.
<BR>
<P>As to the Green Party, I know that it has become the most effective 
<BR>
anti-technology group in Europe, especially in Germany, the first country in 
<BR>
which party members hold ministerial posts.  I would personally include them 
<BR>
on an &quot;anti-progress&quot; watch list here in the US because I fear they may 
<BR>
become the &quot;respectable&quot;, establishment front for more radical &quot;deep ecology&quot; 
<BR>
types and Rifkinites in general.  One of the key developments I'm looking out 
<BR>
for (and hoping I don't see) is an explicit opposition to ALL genetic 
<BR>
engineering as part of official Green Party platforms.
<BR>
<P>By including a category for religious groups on my list, I'm certainly not 
<BR>
indicting all religious people or organizations as anti-progress.  However, 
<BR>
the religious right in the US and fundamentalists elsewhere (especially 
<BR>
Islamic fundamentalists) DO pose a grave danger to the transhumanist agenda. 
<BR>
In the propagation of nonsense such as &quot;creation science&quot;, their opposition 
<BR>
to genetic engineering as &quot;ungodly&quot; and their antagonism to individual 
<BR>
liberty, religious fundamentalism represents the number one threat to the 
<BR>
specific transhumanist goal of augmenting and transcending the human animal - 
<BR>
all IMHO, of course.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
