As a disbeliever in patents, this article warmed my heart,

<P>But the reply that Jeff Bezos was stimulated to write after conversations
<BR>

government to change its laws so that all sides can put down their patent
<BR>
weapons.

&quot;The public universities have entered into an unspoken contract with the
state: they will promote statist ideologies in return for state money.
There are few, desperately few institutes of higher education which follow
truth ruthlessly.&quot;

Cambridge), Spectator 21 viii 1999.
