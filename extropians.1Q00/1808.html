<EM>&gt;  Most solar tech doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quite get it, yet, but some people are rich enough to do it anyway. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is where fuel cells are for the time being, but not much longer, we hope.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Solar tech is not affordable because it is made unaffordable. Do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really believes that an Intel Pentium III 500 Mhz is cheaper to mass-produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a square meter of solar cells?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unn. I don't have time to fight this one. But I'm not going to talk
<BR>
apples and oranges. I have no hard figures for all the costs of either,
<BR>
nor the actual lifetime of either, but solar cells suck as general
<BR>
purpose power sources for people who spend half their time in the dark. 
<BR>
<P>The economics of energy production are tricky, depending on where you
<BR>
decide to stop counting. &quot;Photovoltaic&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;solar&quot;
<BR>
is not synonymous with &quot;renewable&quot;.
<BR>
<P>But the general form of my intent was, if you burn fossil fuel of total
<BR>
energy yield X to run your &quot;green&quot; farm to produce methanol with a net
<BR>
energy yield of Y, but you have received a subsidy of Z so you'll turn a
<BR>
profit... well, you're not quite there yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 4) the second hard one: what will the impact be, both of the MEMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manufacturing (probably manageable) and of massive tapping of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Casimir force, should it take place? And other typically unaccounted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; costs, if any. Dilithium crystal Superfund site, anyone?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         So sorry, what is MEMS? Maybe I missed something on this thread?
</EM><BR>
<P>Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. A catch all for small-scale mechano
<BR>
tech too often mistaken for nano. They use it to make accelerometers for
<BR>
automobile airbag systems now, and the &quot;light valve&quot; tv/computer/movie
<BR>
projectors. The web site (which I suggest you visit) implies strongly
<BR>
that that's the approach they're going o be using in the short term.
<BR>
<P>Imagine making little mechanical things with silicon chip deposition and
<BR>
photolithography. Build up, etch out. Etch *under* some things to
<BR>
produce 3D structures such as plates suspended by tiny vias over a tiny
<BR>
canyon (looking a bit like a trampoline). Theory says that a pair of
<BR>
perfectly conductive planes of infinite extent, separated by 10 nm (100
<BR>
Angstrom, for you classicists) ought to experience an inward force of
<BR>
about one atmosphere. The site does point out that the cycles currently
<BR>
envisioned do no net work.
