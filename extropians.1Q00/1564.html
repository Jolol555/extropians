On a related point, I was speculating recently on the possible evolution of 
<BR>
a sexually transmitted disease which boosts the libido and vitality of 
<BR>
infected individuals. This would make much more sense then the current 
<BR>
strains, which harm sexual success of the victim by covering the afflicted 
<BR>
area with unsightly and painful sores, thus limiting their own infection 
<BR>
success. It would seem that an STD which resulted in higher sex drive and 
<BR>
which someone made the infected individual better looking would be an 
<BR>
incredibly successful STD. I then started to wonder if this has perhaps 
<BR>
already happened, and the virus is now just considered a part of normal 
<BR>
human biology, or perhaps incorporated into the genome.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that the human sex drive is already strong enough that a 
<BR>
virus would not need the ability to enhance it.  At least in the case of 
<BR>
herpes, the sores are not always there and it is right before the outbreak 
<BR>
that the afflicted is most contagious.  Pretty sneaky virus!
<BR>
<P>I read a Clive Barker short story once about a genetically engineered 
<BR>
disease that gets lose.  The accidentally infected researcher has the 
<BR>
overwhelming violent urge to have intercourse with anyone and anything and 
<BR>
has strength rivalling an addict on angel dust.  He sees the world in 
<BR>
totally sexually driven terms(some of you might think you do till you read 
<BR>
the story!).  The story is told from the perspective of the infected man.  
<BR>
It was a very surreal story.
<BR>
<P>It would be nice if viruses would give up the parasitic way of things for 
<BR>
being symbiotic.  Octavia Butler, one of my favorite science-fiction 
<BR>
authors, wrote &quot;Clay's Ark&quot; wherein an alien virus invades earth when the 
<BR>
first human ftl spaceship crashlands but adapts in symbiosis with humanity.  
<BR>
While most humans die of infection, some (mostly with large fat reserves!) 
<BR>
survive and then thrive as near immortals who can regenerate missing limbs 
<BR>
and have superhuman speed, stength and stamina.  The signs of infection are 
<BR>
being extremely thin, excessive sweating and constant eating.
<BR>
<P>But there is a price.  The virus gives an almost uncontrollable compulsion 
<BR>
to breed(as opposed to Barker's virus where you are blinded by lust 
<BR>
entirely).  The children produced have human faces but lower bodies like a 
<BR>
sphinx to the shock of their parents.  And their minds and emotions are 
<BR>
different too.  The leader of the initial infected group (a surviving 
<BR>
astronaut) struggles to contain his urges and those of the ones around him.
<BR>
<P>Octavia Butler is a very gifted writer who brings her characters and 
<BR>
storylines alive like few can and she has gotten from not just the 
<BR>
science-fiction but also the mainstream writing community the praise she 
<BR>
deserves.  Her stories are very gritty and show the darkside of human nature 
<BR>
to the point of making me want to flinch at times.  I highly recommend her.
<BR>
<P>For all the pain and death viruses have caused, I am glad to see them put to 
<BR>
work in humanities service in the cause of genetic engineering.
<BR>
Now their formally insidious methods will do us some good.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
