<EM>&gt; &gt;Again, destructive/stupid/selfish compared to what?  To

<EM>&gt; &gt;other species?  I don't think that's a fair comparison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Point me to a less-destructive/less-stupid/less-selfish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;civilisation that exists anywhere but in dreams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By that argument I cannot have an opinion about the human species -- there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no other civilization to compare us to! Fortunately for the thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who, like me, enjoy thinkink about the human race as a whole, that line of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasoning is incorrect. Of course I can compare it to what my ideal
</EM><BR>
fantasy
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of humankind would be. If you don't like it, no problem, you will have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion about humankind -- and that will save a lot of worries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Comparing the real to the ideal is fair game, though then the question
<BR>
arises of how well found the particular ideal is.
<BR>
<P>However, it seems many on this thread treat humanity as if it has and has
<BR>
only had one civilization.  Why is this assumed?  It might be argued that
<BR>
there is one civilization today and that given the degree of interaction
<BR>
since last century, this has been the case for some time.  Even so, what of
<BR>
a thousand or two or three thousand years ago?  It would seem that, back
<BR>
that far, there were several civilizations -- Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Indus,
<BR>
Chinese, various preColumbian ones, etc.  Comparisons can be made between
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Even if one does not accept this line of thinking, we can, at least, look at
<BR>
certain aspects of the current civilization and extrapolate from them given
<BR>
that it has changed over time.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps we should begin by asking just what civilization is...
<BR>
<P>Have a great time!
