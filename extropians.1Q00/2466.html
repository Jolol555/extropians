OTOH, beauty _is_ only skin deep.  And when skin itself becomes a more
<BR>
manageable medium we may get lucky and the prevalent memes change
<BR>
(parameme shift?) and suddenly the search for a mate becomes based more on 
<BR>
intellect and personality and compatibility and the like, and less on 
<BR>
physical attraction, which is a dynamic attribute.  Okay, not too likely.  
<BR>
But, at the very least, the importance of the physical would seem to 
<BR>
diminish.  Fabio's not all that special if any Tom, Dick or Nadia can look 
<BR>
like him.  Hooked on Neologism- -Evan-

<P>I totally agree, Evan!!  I have heard many people say that a mature body mod 
<BR>
technology would, &quot;take away the uniqueness and special nature of physical 
<BR>
beauty in humans because everyone would be beautiful&quot; but I think this 
<BR>
technology would overturn the tyranny of beauty elitism that is brought on 
<BR>
by unfair (to most human minds) rolls of the genetic dice that has allowed 
<BR>
for only a few to be extremely attractive.  Body appearance would transmit 
<BR>
social information to a prospective partner much the way clothes do now.
<BR>
<P>I also think that with this tech we will see people not focusing so much on 
<BR>
looks but on intellect, accomplishments, personality and character.  What an 
<BR>
AMAZING world it will be!! lol  Of course unless nanotech really transforms 
<BR>
things economically, we will still see money being very important as to 
<BR>
status.  But even in a &quot;transformed world,&quot; the status and accomplishments 
<BR>
of one's career would be important.
<BR>
<P>I see modelling in the future being much more dependant on the model having 
<BR>
accomplished something to gain admiration rather then just be attractive.  
<BR>
But what will become of those who would have become models had they been 
<BR>
born in our time? :)  Natasha and Queenemuse are examples of well-rounded 
<BR>
women who could be 22nd century models. :)
<BR>
