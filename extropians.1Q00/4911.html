<EM>&gt; I haven't read the piece yet but will have to do so soon. I'm on a private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wired magazine email list that includes Bill Joy and others and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion of his piece is just getting going, with Charles Platt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticizing Wired's publication of the piece, with replies so far by Howard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rheingold, Stewart Brand, Paul Saffo, and others. Once I've read Joy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; essay, I'll be joining in. If you have specific questions, comments, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticisms that you'd like conveyed to Bill Joy and the others, please let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me know. (I will, of course, give appropriate credit.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have just read the piece, and expect it to be a watershed event.  I found it
<BR>
very well written, and representing a great deal of thought Bill had put in over a
<BR>
long time.  The most important thing about it is that it says to the public, &quot;This
<BR>
Stuff is Real.&quot;  Bill may claim that the safeguards mentioned by Eric are not
<BR>
going to work, but he completely accepts that MNT is coming.
<BR>
<P>Bill is forced to take Ray seriously because he sees the computational power
<BR>
projection of the next 30 years.  Again, this stuff is real.  He does not see
<BR>
(yet) that self organizing AI is going to get going somewhere, whether we set out
<BR>
to do that or not. (Daniel Hillis is correct: we will get used to it.)
<BR>
<P>The main part Bill has not thought through is the big picture.  A natural part of
<BR>
evolution is that species come and go.  Homo (you name it) did and so will Homo
<BR>
Sapiens.  We are now past the point of no return.  Malthus knew the bio system
<BR>
could not support our continued growth much longer.  We are using up the stored
<BR>
resources and must have new technical substitutes.  The dinosaurs went for
<BR>
hundreds of millions of years in mindless eat-and-be-eaten lives until an event
<BR>
they could not be ready for wiped them out.
<BR>
<P>Bill has also not taken the memes into consideration.  Our technology memeplex is
<BR>
quite powerful, and no one is in control.  In any technical race the fact that
<BR>
something is possible is the most important piece of information.  Biology has
<BR>
shown us what is possible with replicators; extension of this knowledge is
<BR>
inevitable.
<BR>
<P>The idea that simple humans are going to strike out into the galaxy is as
<BR>
mismatched as Fred Flintstone driving a car he pushes with his feet.  Bill may
<BR>
like the Startrek model, but nobody, as stupid as we, are going to build and
<BR>
inhabit starships.  We must modify ourselves to be up to the task that stretches
<BR>
into the future.  There was nothing wrong with being human to get here, but the
<BR>
idea of the future of humanity cannot be more of the same.
<BR>
<P>All and all, it is about time for this debate in the general press.  Yes, there
<BR>
will be trouble from this, but it is a coming of age for the concepts we care
<BR>
about.  So, &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, hang in there, be positive, but also know the memes are
<BR>
riding us all, and will not stop.
