<P><EM>&gt; I recall a famous case of this a decade back, when someone patented a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  machine to keep a human head alive.  The head would be hooked up to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  heart-lung machine, the blood would go through dialysis, etc.  The stated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intention was to make sure this horrible-sounding technology would never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be used (at least not for 17 years).
</EM><BR>
Even worse! Suppose such a person (Mr./Mrs. Head) was employed as a porno 
<BR>
star? Kinda reminds me of Futurama-with all those celebrity heads in bell 
<BR>
jars. Including cartoonist Matt Groening.
