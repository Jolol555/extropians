<EM>&gt;From: Dana Hedberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dah@signalinteractive.com?Subject=Re:%20more%20fascist%20frothing&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000314192941.19498.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">dah@signalinteractive.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In this debate, people who are against guns (or are for stricter gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laws/enforcement, etc.) I think are missing a vital point. They want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blanket &quot;punishments&quot; for the actions a limited few. As well, it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they can't see the forest for the trees. They continually point to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapon as the problem. Some go a bit further and say it's access to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapon, or accountability of the people/dealers/NRA/parents that give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them access to weapons. In actuality it's the mentality/psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make-up of the person that uses a gun (or any weapon for that matter) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be destructive against another person(s). Oh, to be sure, there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who ask the question why. But the answer is either too complex or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too frightening to understand that very little is done on this front.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Too many people are willing to pronounce guns as evil and ignore the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact that there was a person behind that weapon using it for ill. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was a person with a *reason* for using that weapon the way they did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is where the issue lies.
</EM><BR>
<P>No question.  I *absolutely* agree with you.  I just figured it would be a 
<BR>
lot easier to take the gun out of the psychopath's hand than it would be to 
<BR>
take the pathology out of his head.  If you think there's a practical way to 
<BR>
legislate against pathology, count me in, I'm all for it.
