<EM>&gt; Women over seventy five would rather be dead than be in a home with a hip

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This article seems pretty timely given the recent discussions on the lack
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a mass desire to live for a good long time.  I think it's important to
</EM><BR>
keep
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in mind that, for many of the elderly, aging really does lead to
</EM><BR>
situations
<BR>
<EM>&gt; like this, and it is at least somewhat understandable if they don't relish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea of immortality.  We will need to make some serious inroads
</EM><BR>
against
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the debilitating effects of aging before we can expect much of the
</EM><BR>
populace
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to start taking seriously, and ultimately supporting, the kinds of
</EM><BR>
increases
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in life expectancy we're...well...expecting.

<P>Personally, I'm hanging on no matter what. Dribbling, being fed my ice cream
<BR>
mixed with my porridge, colostomy bags. I'm hoping that if its necessary, I
<BR>
can get through the seriously undignified years doped to my eyeballs, to be
<BR>
detoxed when I can be rejuvenated. I'm also really hoping that we can get
<BR>
some decent life-extension &amp; rejuvenation tech together early, so this wont
<BR>
be necessary.
<BR>
<P>Or, I get built into a power wheelchair, build a race of improbable rolling
<BR>
sentient death machines with suction pads instead of hands, and take over
<BR>
the ground floors (weakness=stairs) of the rest of the universe.
