<EM>&gt; So, an *endowment* for continuing funding of the Iridium project. That makes

<P>Hi Esther, thanks for contributing. I agree, though I wonder whether
<BR>
satellites are actually the technology needed by undeveloped and
<BR>
developing countries for extending communication systems to extreme
<BR>
rural communities. I've done some research on the cost and utility of
<BR>
weather balloon technologies, and I don't see any reason why any
<BR>
underdeveloped nation cannot buy Iridium or Teledesic-like platforms
<BR>
(which are compact and light) and mount them on large high altitude
<BR>
balloons (15,000 to 30,000 feet) that are anchored by kevlar/carbon
<BR>
fiber to ground stations. Such a setup should be able to cover very
<BR>
large areas,  with virtually 'no' launch costs (I'm thinking at least
<BR>
70-90% of the total cost of each platform), the stations are not
<BR>
inundated by radiation, and can be recovered by parachutes in the event
<BR>
of a balloon failure, so lifetime should be longer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my own experience living in the Puget Sound area, where Mount
</EM><BR>
Rainier climbs to almost 15,000 feet, and is visible for a radius of 100
<BR>
miles at least, that a station at that altitude ought to be quite
<BR>
useful, and more affordable than satellites.
