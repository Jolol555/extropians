<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It is truly astonishing that, after the perhaps 2,500-year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;documentation of the human tendency to inflict violence on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;his own kind to achieve merely selfish ends, we still listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;those who advocate that some personal acquisitive desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;should be regarded as superordinate to the welfare of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;community upon which this individual depends. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of privilege is forfeit by those whose very polemics are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;grounded in social indifference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we substitute &quot;God&quot; for &quot;society&quot; in this paragraph we get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that - to me- is indistinguishable from religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enthusiasm.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is certainly possible to deify a social group or its leaders --
<BR>
we have in ancient times the Divine Emperor Augustus, and
<BR>
the medieval &quot;Divine Right of Kings&quot;. Consider the &quot;Tribes of
<BR>
Israel&quot; -- not a deified, but a &quot;sacred and chosen&quot; people.
<BR>
Very like &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; during the expansionist, if not
<BR>
imperialist, phase of American history. &quot;Nationalism&quot; can
<BR>
degenerate into a perverse form of religious fanaticism.
<BR>
<P>But in a democracy, we are all in principle EQUAL* and we are
<BR>
said to have &quot;inalienable rights&quot; not because we are divine
<BR>
but because &quot;we were endowed by our Creator&quot; with these
<BR>
rights.  And one constitutional responsibility of our elected
<BR>
government is to protect our right to life, liberty and the
<BR>
pursuit of &quot;Happiness&quot;, as well as to secure the General
<BR>
Welfare.  Our founding fathers were deists, not theists. The
<BR>
majority were both Unitarians and/or Freemasons. The LAST
<BR>
thing they wanted was a &quot;theocracy&quot; and that is why our 
<BR>
articles of incorporation stress the separation of church and
<BR>
state.
<BR>
<P>All this is important because our utilitarian ethic is designed
<BR>
to assure the greatest good for the greatest number --
<BR>
that is the Ideal situation. But we neither worship each other,
<BR>
nor our government, which we can abolish &quot;if it becomes
<BR>
destructive of these ends&quot;, nor our President, who has
<BR>
exactly the same amount of power (in theory) as the
<BR>
Congress and the Supreme Court -- we hardly worship
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>I -- and probably you -- consider it a grave constitutional
<BR>
error to include the word &quot;God&quot; in our loyalty oath -- all
<BR>
societies have them. But I as an individual, and you, don't
<BR>
make the rules; they are fabricated on the basis of what to
<BR>
men and women of good will is considered a consensus of
<BR>
opinion (in principle). But &quot;love of country&quot;, like &quot;reverence
<BR>
for ancestors&quot; and &quot;devotion to family&quot; DO tap some of the
<BR>
same emotional resources exploited by organized religions.
<BR>
<P>The remainder of your post deserves a response -- I think
<BR>
I should terminate this post here. We can continue our
<BR>
discussion if you wish -- write me anytime either to talk
<BR>
or tell me if you would like me to comment on the rest of
<BR>
your thoughtful post online.
<BR>
<P>Respectfully,
<BR>
<P>Bob

This does not imply the absence of degrees of social merit
<BR>
associated with offices any more than we all have I.Q.'s of
<BR>
100 -- some children's' mental age exceeds their chronolog-
<BR>
ica age and they merit special educational treatment. More
<BR>
on &quot;democracy&quot; &quot;aristocracy&quot; and &quot;meritocracy&quot; if you wish.
