</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another column for two weeks.  Would any of you like to respond to this one?

<P><P>Let me try to articulate a libertarian answer to this:
<BR>
<P><P>Is it democratic to make babies before you have studied
<BR>
enough and worked enough to make sure they will have
<BR>
sufficient resources to be productive members of society
<BR>
and not homeless - and then voting, together with other
<BR>
irresponsible people, to take by force the wealth from 
<BR>
people who (or whose families) were more responsible?
<BR>
<P>I assume that some people may have been impoverished in
<BR>
the result of very bad luck (children of professors who had
<BR>
a brain tumor and whose savings and health/life insurance
<BR>
were simultaneously wiped out in a Y2K glitch - and who 
<BR>
have no friends or relatives that would care to help
<BR>
them [?] )
<BR>
<P>I think that in a free and at least somewhat compassionate
<BR>
society there should be many enough people who would
<BR>
voluntarily help such victims of incredible strings
<BR>
of bad luck, on the condition that they will wait with
<BR>
having their own children until they acquire a solid
<BR>
profession and save enough money so that they can raise
<BR>
their own children by themselves.
<BR>
<P>No need to rob anybody.
<BR>
<P>And about gaps in general:  you have resource allocation
<BR>
gaps/differences in any system, from ecosystems to economy
<BR>
to personal budget.  Good distribution intends to put
<BR>
resources where they can be used best - not worst, and
<BR>
give incentives to everybody to perform better, so that
<BR>
in the next generations everybody would be better off.
<BR>
<P>Current &quot;poor&quot; have incomparably better health and knowledge
<BR>
access than kings of the recent past.
<BR>
<P>You can also try to eliminate comparable, by life stage, gaps.
<BR>
I may currently be twice your age and have more money working
<BR>
on commercial AI, with just one child I decided I could support
<BR>
well - while you are only 22, have a crappy computer, mortgage
<BR>
to pay and two kids who you have trouble supporting.
<BR>
<P>But when I was 22, I may have worked in a f*cking communist
<BR>
country on jobs that were forced on me under the threat of labor
<BR>
camps, had no computer, was not allowed to even mention the desire
<BR>
to own a house or anything else, and being responsible, could not
<BR>
afford any kids.
<BR>
<P>So in a comparable stage of your life, you live so much better.
<BR>
Want to compensate me for the unfortunate past I had?
<BR>
How about just anybody older than you are?
<BR>
Don't forget they won't see as much future interesting things
<BR>
as you will...
<BR>
<P>There are so many gaps...
<BR>
<P>Or you just want to look at currently visible things?
<BR>
<P>Even for those, you can come up with a hundred of other compensation
<BR>
schemes in various currencies - what if person A is richer than
<BR>
person B, but has spent too much time earning his/her wealth to
<BR>
work on his/her looks, or is &quot;genetically/chronologically
<BR>
challenged&quot; and can't get enough sex?  Should s/he be entitled to
<BR>
some sexual charity (make it a democratic &quot;tax&quot;) ?
<BR>
<P>How should smart and healthy people compensate those dumb and sick?
<BR>
<P>Should experienced / grown-up people compensate younger people
<BR>
for their relative disadvantages?
<BR>
<P>Etc., etc.
<BR>
<P>Who is there to decide what should be compensated?
<BR>
<P>Mob rule?
