Thanks for your response. The reason I suppose we can see stars from the
<BR>
earth is because there are no very large objects reflecting massive amounts
<BR>
of sunlight in our view.
<BR>
<P>Thanks Dana,
<BR>
<P>Tom
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From Phil Plait's website
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(<A HREF="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/starwars2.html">http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/starwars2.html</A>):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Bad: In a scene from high above Naboo, we see a fleet of Trade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Federation ships
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;silhouetted against the planet, and beyond that the sky is full of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Good: This is a common scene in science fiction movies, but ask yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question: have you ever seen anything like it in real life? The answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is no. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NASA broadcasts live scenes from outside the Space Shuttle, you usually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Earth in vivid blues, browns, greens and dazzling white, but you never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see stars at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same time. And if you can see stars, the Earth is tremendously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overexposed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The reason for this is contrast. Stars are fairly faint, while the Earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(or the Shuttle, or astronauts floating in space) are very bright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They're sitting in full sunlight!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So the Earth, when lit by the Sun, is many hundreds or thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;times brighter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than the stars behind it. When the astronauts set the camera to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pictures, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to adjust it for that brightness. To expose the Earth correctly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shut out most of the light hitting the camera, and the faint stars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannot be seen. If they adjust the camera to let in enough light to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stars (or more accurately, use a camera which amplifies the light of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stars), the Earth floods the camera with light, vastly overexposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;itself. So even though the sky looks black, there will be no stars in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the picture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have received a few emails about this part, asking if the human eye
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things differently than a camera. In other words, the human eye is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seeing higher contrast than a camera, so is my objection still valid?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, it is. Ron Parise is a Shuttle astronaut who happens to work down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the hall from me (how cool is my job?), so I asked him if he could see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lots of stars out the Shuttle window when the sunlit Earth was below
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;him. He said no; the only stars you can see are the very brightest ones,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and only a few of those. As with a camera, the human eye only has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limited range of brightness it can perceive, and the Earth (or Naboo!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is so bright it swamps all the stars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a side note, I'll add that some people, remarkably, think that NASA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually sent men to the Moon; that all the Apollo films were faked. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;key evidence, they cite that all the pictures taken from the Moon have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no stars in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them! So instead of asking someone who might understand photography,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they jump
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the conclusion that NASA managed to undertake the largest conspiracy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is Bad reasoning in its absolute highest form.&quot;
</EM><BR>
