<EM>&gt; Which is ME being the bluntly confident one.  (They, Robert and Ralph, seem

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this instance, I am not suggesting that it is they who are blunt, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should anyone hold them responsible for bluntness, excessive or otherwise,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the basis of my report.  They are--seems to me-- &quot;confident&quot;; I are, on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the semi-unimpeachable authority of knowing my own mind, &quot;blunt&quot;.  Just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call me Mr. Blunt, or The Blunt One. )

<P>Soooo, thou doth seekest to steal the crown of bluntness.
<BR>
Well, I say, &quot;nay kind gentlebluntperson&quot;, thou mayst only posess the
<BR>
crown of bluntness whenst thoust has proved thy worthy bluntness.
<BR>
I see around me, a field filled with torn and broken memes that
<BR>
are slowly rotting having attempted to assault my bluntness.
<BR>
<P>I see in the distance, several other Extropian Knights whose
<BR>
bluntness may even exceed mine own, but while their bluntness
<BR>
is directed towards a singular focus, my bluntness is reknowned
<BR>
for its few limits.  [Recall if you will an incident at Extro4...]
<BR>
<P>So, if thoust desire the Crown of Bluntness, bearing in mind that
<BR>
one should never join a club that would have you as a member,
<BR>
then thoust needeth offer a greater claim than a single soliloquy.
<BR>
<P>However, Jeff Davis, you clearly have within you the material of
<BR>
a fine and scholarly bluntperson.  I think we may confidently nominate
<BR>
you for the position of bluntperson's apprentice.
<BR>
