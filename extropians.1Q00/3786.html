<P>
Up front I should say that I'm not arguing against vitrification
<BR>
in favor of freezing.  I'm arguing that even with our current
<BR>
freezing methods that leave what appear to be unrecoverable
<BR>
damage it makes emminent sense to sign up for cryonics.  If
<BR>
somebody can come along and make the freezing damage
<BR>
less destructive I'm all in favor of that.
<BR>
<P>Thus sprach Eugene Leitl:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Freezing is largely nondissipative.  No. Disagree strongly here.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't matter how strongly you disagree; this is basic
<BR>
physics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Though not having to bear burden of proof,
</EM><BR>
<P>You, like myself and all other posters, bear the burden of proof
<BR>
to the extent you want to convince the list of your point of view.
<BR>
<P>As a practical matter, argument in favor of change from
<BR>
a traditional technique (in your case, from freezing to
<BR>
vitrification) bears more burden of proof.
<BR>
<P>An argument for changing from a faith-based belief in a soul
<BR>
to belief in the efficacy of cryonics in general bears
<BR>
very little burden of scientific proof.  The standard of care
<BR>
in the immortality industry is remarkably low.   The cryonics
<BR>
industry with all its warts already meets a much higher
<BR>
standard than most immortality consumers demand.
<BR>
<P>Not at all arguing against scientific study -- after all I
<BR>
consider myself to be a sophisticated consumer and want the
<BR>
best science possible for *my* body.  But if the issue
<BR>
is the practical consumer choice of signing up for cryonics
<BR>
vs. succumbing to the promises of faith-based immortality,
<BR>
let's put this &quot;burden of proof&quot; thing in perspective.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; damage Merkle's analysis may be too *pessimistic*: we can often use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a joke, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  MLE is a very inefficient way to solve the problem if one
<BR>
instead can solve most of the problem using pattern matching
<BR>
algorithms. (While according to Merkle's analysis we will have more
<BR>
than enough CPU cycles to do MLE, this is important if for
<BR>
other reasons, as you argue, the problem is harder than he states).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The cryptoanalysis analogy is btw perfectly valid if you attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reconstruct the real thing by monitoring operation (say, using 10^9
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nanoprobes in vivo), especially if including manipulative measures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(exciting subsystems and analyzing their activity dynamics).
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be even more useful if we had pre-deanimation measurements
<BR>
to test against.  SPECT, EKG, and behavior videos may be crude by
<BR>
future standards, but they provide a substantial amount of
<BR>
information on target neural dynamics that is currently being
<BR>
lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's just that a lot of people will die, perhaps all of us here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;present, if we wait for the advent of this technology (if it indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrives, which is far from being guaranteed). Nor is sustainability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;patient storage guaranteed.
</EM><BR>
<P>The probabilities are small, but the expected value is vast.
<BR>
A finite but still large version of Pascal's wager.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you thought that typical cryonics patients look bad, don't even try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to look at straight freeze. Ugh.
</EM><BR>
<P>It does not at all matter how they &quot;look&quot; to an eye untrained
<BR>
in chemistry *and* computational reconstruction techniques.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your stainless steel bracelet does not guarantee salvation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly not.   That's where we fall back on faith in the
<BR>
Omega point. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ischaemia is being adequately addressed, also (especially,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considering the resources) by the mainstream. Brain vitrification is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good point.  I'm not arguing against vitrification
<BR>
in favor of freezing.  I'm arguing that it makes very good sense
<BR>
to sign up even with the bad-looking freezing methods employed
<BR>
today.   It makes good sense to support scientific research
<BR>
into techniques such as vitrification as well.
