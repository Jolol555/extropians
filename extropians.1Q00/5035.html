<P>In 1946 Edward Teller's group realized that there is no theoretical

limit to how large a nuclear fusion device could be made.  One could
<BR>
theoretically nuke the entire earth with one such weapon, in which
<BR>
case there was no need to haul it elsewhere.  It came to be known
<BR>
as the backyard weapon, effective only in scaring away would be

invaders.  We could imagine some wacko dictator announcing that
<BR>
there were hungry nanoassemblers squirrelled away within her borders,
<BR>
and so she was immediately dismantling her military.  Would an
<BR>
invader chance it?  spike
