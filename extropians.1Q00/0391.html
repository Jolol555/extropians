<P>
Robert I want to thank you for a very well thought out post. If I am 
<BR>
understanding you correctly, you have hit upon an important topic relative to 
<BR>
creativity, though I'd substitute the word &quot;variance&quot; - or possibly 
<BR>
&quot;divergence&quot; for inconsistency. However in your post you make some other 
<BR>
assertions about creativity that I'd like to attempt to correct.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;There are several issues you put forth.
<BR>
1) PURPOSE: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say - &lt;&lt; I would object strongly to the suggestion that the purpose 
<BR>
of creativity  is to &quot;make things happen.&quot;  Creativity occurs every time we 
<BR>
string
<BR>
&nbsp;words together and may have no value other than our own entertainment.
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Is art and &quot;work&quot; (whatever discipline one prefers to refer to) exclusively 
<BR>
for others' recognition? Is it created for validation &amp; results? Can't it be 
<BR>
simply for one's own enjoyment? Can't I paint a masterpeice, let no one see 
<BR>
it, and throw it in the trash - for my own self amusement, and still be 
<BR>
creating? You seem to assert that it is not valid until it receives outside 
<BR>
recognition. This may be the way academia works - work is not valid until 
<BR>
published or reviewed, and how business of art is done, but it does not cover 
<BR>
the spectrum of creativity across mediums.
<BR>
<P>2) Process vs. Product. (Or: ideas vs. realization) 
<BR>
you say:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Returning to Natasha's Art
<BR>
&nbsp;(hoping she doesn't mind this), would we consider her &quot;creative&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;if all of her productions were recognizable variations on a similar
<BR>
&nbsp;theme?  I'm unsure whether the evolution of her art is due to
<BR>
&nbsp;desire and discipline or whether it is a more natural process
<BR>
&nbsp;(akin to &quot;growing&quot;). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
First I'd like to ask you, have you visited her online art gallery? Did you 
<BR>
ask her whether her art requires intense discipline? Have you seen the 
<BR>
&quot;variations on a theme&quot; that is the DNA breakout series? You are talking to a 
<BR>
diehard fan of her art, BTW.
<BR>
You first make assertions that creativity requires communication and 
<BR>
recognition, and perhaps even having an impact of some sort on an outside 
<BR>
&quot;audience.&quot; Then you (inconsistently ; - ) imply that the nature of art is a 
<BR>
natural outpouring, or growth. Is this really true? What are your sources for 
<BR>
this assertion?
<BR>
<P>3) CARDINALITY or Originality:
<BR>
In my opinion, Novelty is highly overrated.
<BR>
You assert that a work is not creative unless it is &quot;new&quot; - even that it 
<BR>
isn't creative to conceive and execute similar variations on a theme. Is this 
<BR>
realistic? As an artist I cannot say that I have ever done anything truly 
<BR>
original, yet each of my own pieces is unlike anything before. I believe we 
<BR>
build on foundations, and improve and rearrange things in new ways. Music 
<BR>
that is utterly new would be cacophonous. The truly new would be unfamiliar 
<BR>
and unrecognizable and hence cognitively boring. This is a totally unrelated 
<BR>
thread, but a very key aspect of futurism: Are we to create a totally new 
<BR>
paradigm, or are we wiser to build on certain patterns we have already 
<BR>
established. The unfamiliarity of all things is inherent in the concept of 
<BR>
Singularity (and I admit I am not a Singulatarian by any means!!) If things 
<BR>
are to be pleasing to our aesthetics, and rational in nature, should we not 
<BR>
keep what works and build upon it, rather than throwing away all concepts in 
<BR>
search of originality?
<BR>
<P>And finally
<BR>
4) COGNITIVE PROCESS
<BR>
&nbsp;....how the creative mind works, in respect to being able to create and hold 
<BR>
a variety of concepts, mixing them in new ways, without being bound by 
<BR>
tradition - and the relating label of &quot;inconsistency.&quot; I see your point here, 
<BR>
and I agree, variance and flexibility can combine/juxtapose more freely. Aaha!
<BR>
