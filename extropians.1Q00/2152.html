<EM>&gt; &lt; Mutations have always been assumed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      random. But mutations are caused by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      motion of fundamental particles, electrons and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      protons -- particles that can enter the quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      multiverse -- within the double helix. If these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      particles can enter quantum states. then DNA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      may be able to slip into the quantum multiverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                      and sample multiple mutations simultaneously. &gt;
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; Despite the apparently comic author name (Johnjoe McFadden indeed!), he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for real, and British not from some place where they eat raw chickens'
</EM><BR>
heads.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I kinda like this idea, which sounds straight out of David Deutsch (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drives the plot of Greg Egan's recent TERANESIA, by the way). It just
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fits with the information optimisation models of lab parapsychology that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appeal to me (i.e., the brain might have some enhanced chance of knowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the apparently unknowable if sampling superspace reveals a skew in favor
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one outcome over all others).

<P>Whether this has any basis in truth, I love the concept.  I certainly have
<BR>
no plan on abandoning some more basic materialist premises, but this kind of
<BR>
thing makes the journey far, far more interesting.
<BR>
<P>Also, it has very interesting ramifications for the creationism/evolution
<BR>
debate.  The strongest sticking point against evolution seems to be the
<BR>
incredulity that something so complex could arise from processes that are
<BR>
thought of as random.  In the case that this concept (quantum evolution)
<BR>
could be made understood, it would seem to undermine that argument.  DNA
<BR>
having a &quot;plan&quot;, if you will.  Directed processes though no higher power or
<BR>
even conscious decision.  Though, even if true, I doubt an argument from
<BR>
quantum anything would be accepted in the slightest.  Pat Robertson still
<BR>
believes schizophrenia doesn't exist and is merely demonic.
<BR>
<P>Interesting to note how a few scientific theories are serving to explain
<BR>
some of the fundamental issues of existence in ways their mystical
<BR>
proponents could never have dreamed of.  Quantum evolution over intelligent
<BR>
design, SI-controlled simulations over deity, the aforementioned sampling
<BR>
over ESP.  It will be quite the strange situation if science begins
<BR>
explaining, scientifically, many of the concepts it currently discards.
