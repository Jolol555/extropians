<EM>&gt; &gt;  There are at least two pieces of evidence for the notion that galaxies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  more massive than we can account for by the visible stars and dust in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  galaxies.  (There are probably others that I'm not aware of.)

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snipped.....very excellent summation&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing that's got me curious though is the &quot;many worlds theory&quot;of Everitt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to my (very limited) understanding of Quantum Mechanics ....as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested by the dual slit photon interference studies.....Everett suggested 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it might all be explained by multiple &lt;infinite?&gt; parallel universes...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Might not the parallel universe concept explain the missing mass?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen at least two attempts to explain things this way. One is in John 
<BR>
Cramer's Science-Fiction book 'Twistor'. John is a scientist (an 
<BR>
astrophysicist, if I'm not mistaken. I noticed just the other day that he's 
<BR>
recently received a grant from NASA to look into reactionless propulsion for 
<BR>
spacecraft). He naturally skewed the details to get his story to work. He 
<BR>
assumed that all parallel universes were (very weakly) gravitationally 
<BR>
interacting, and that there was a finite (and small) number of them. This 
<BR>
doesn't really square with Everett since it requires a finite number of 
<BR>
universes.
<BR>
<P>The other reference is a recent paper that claimed our universe was folded many 
<BR>
times in a fourth dimension, and that gravity propagates through the folds, 
<BR>
while light has to travel along the folds. The result would be gravitational 
<BR>
interactions with matter that appears to be millions or billions of light years 
<BR>
distant. This theory works just as well if you assume that parallel universes 
<BR>
are 'stacked' in the fourth dimension. If there is any real interest in the 
<BR>
paper, I can try to dig it up, but I'm not sure I kept a copy since I was 
<BR>
strongly unconvinced by the arguments presented in it.
