'What is your name?'  'Robert Bradbury.'  'Do you deny having written the 
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Computer modeling of the protein shape, based on first principles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    known shapes of protein &quot;motifs&quot; (that have been copied throughout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the genomes), and expanded computer power (e.g. IBM's Blue Gene)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    will converge to give highly accurate models for those proteins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that for which crystals are difficult, and even those for which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    they are easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the area of the project which seems the most promising.  However,
<BR>
notice that just as soon as we &quot;finish&quot; the human genome project, we need
<BR>
to start it all over again to look for errors.  (And, believe me, we HAVE
<BR>
made mistakes in the recording of all this information, many of which may
<BR>
have significant consequences.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) We will rapidly determine genes involved in specific pathways (through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    evolutionary conservation across organisms), the regulatory sequences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for genes (which must be conserved across organisms as well) and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    pathways in which they function (through differential expression studies).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Knowing what genes stay together and play together, combined with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    computer analysis of the 3-D substructures that identify conserved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    regions, catalytic sites, phosphorylated amino acids, etc. will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    allow rapid assignment of functions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's where I have to differ.  The cell is a messy and complicated beast.
<BR>
It's not just full of other proteins, but other products of enzymatic
<BR>
reactions.  And metals.  And carbohydrates.
<BR>
<P>Taking a quick glance at the carbohydrates near the membrane of a cell,
<BR>
you might notice that they have a quite complicated structure.  Right now,
<BR>
as far as we know, these very complicated carbohydrates, by and large,
<BR>
don't do anything, except in some cases sit there and make the neighboring
<BR>
region just a little bit more hydrophilic.  (Emphasis on the &quot;by and
<BR>
large,&quot; since some of them are quite interesting indeed.)
<BR>
<P>My biomedical engineering professor last semester (who's getting on in his
<BR>
years) had some cutting remarks on this point.  See, there was a time,
<BR>
back in the earlier part of this century, when people were just starting
<BR>
to take a close look at the nucleic acids floating about in the cell. They
<BR>
had an interesting and complicated structure, but, as far as anyone could
<BR>
tell at the time, they didn't appear to do anything.  The cell bio
<BR>
textbooks of his day claimed that DNA was probably just there to make the
<BR>
cell nucleus more acidic.
<BR>
<P>This suggests to my professor that we don't know quite as much about
<BR>
molecular biology as we might wish we did, and that much more research
<BR>
will be needed before we'll even be able to send in the powerful computers
<BR>
like Blue Gene to figure out what's going on there in very much detail.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, I think over the next ten years people will be quite surprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at how fast things will move.
</EM><BR>
<P>For what it's worth, the biomedical community is extremely conservative in
<BR>
its estimates, by and large; IMO, this is because no one who has worked in
<BR>
biology for a long time has ever seen real rapid Growth in the field,
<BR>
certainly not the rate computer science has Grown, though the biomedical
<BR>
community HAS heard promises of rapid growth in the past.  (I bet nobody
<BR>
remembers the day when the synthetic chemists were making the sort of
<BR>
promises that nanotech people are making today.  On some level, nanotech
<BR>
is just a fulfillment of that earlier vision, but O how long it has been
<BR>
in coming!)
<BR>
<P>The people who have looked at DNA from a computer science perspective see
<BR>
this as the sort of problem that will fall under the same sort of rapid
<BR>
growth as the rest of computer science, since they see microbiology as a
<BR>
sort of wet Turing machine, whose most basic rules have all been basically
<BR>
figured out, and which now need only a better meta-description, in terms
<BR>
of enzymes and products instead of in terms of DNA and proteins.  CS
<BR>
people look at this project like trying to reverse engineer a compiler.
<BR>
<P>The analogy isn't strictly wrong, but a whole lot of details have been
<BR>
hidden when you look at the picture in a way that can be reasonably
<BR>
described in CS terms.  Like carbohydrates.  Like all the other gunk
<BR>
floating around in the cytoplasm.  Like organometallic chemistry.
<BR>
<P>Indeed, I predict that the real work will be in coming up with a useful
<BR>
description of the chemistry involved, ideally one that we can understand,
<BR>
but if not, maybe just one that some future Blue computer can think about.
<BR>
Something that can think about the chemistry of very complicated molecules
<BR>
in the sort of terms that synthetic chemists think of our molecules today,
<BR>
only much much better.
<BR>
<P>We might not see this model before Singularity.  In fact, as I write this,
<BR>
I suspect that we *probably* won't see this before Singularity.
<BR>
<P>Oh, well.  Back to work.
