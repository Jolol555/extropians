<EM>&gt;Subject: opening up immigration

<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;One project is to convince one relatively rich economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;somewhere to completely open its borders to immigration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;even setting up a loan program to pay for transportation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;costs.  This might do more for the world's poor than most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;anything I can imagine.  And that one country could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;benefit immensely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Robin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I like this idea.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am not sure I do like this idea. You see, I sell my labor for a living. 
<BR>
The location of  my &quot; business,&quot; such as it is, gives me a substantial 
<BR>
competitive advantage over competing laborers in other countries. These 
<BR>
competitive advantages attract capital to my business location, that being 
<BR>
the United States of America. A partial  enumeration of these &quot;competitve 
<BR>
advantages&quot; are as follows:
<BR>
<P>1. great stability relative to other &quot;business locations&quot; such as Asia, 
<BR>
South America, etc.
<BR>
<P>2. No history of massive &quot;nationalization&quot; of business assets, aka theivery 
<BR>
by government.
<BR>
<P>3. A massive market for consumer goods linked by an excellent infrastruture.
<BR>
<P>4. A national culture that tends toward order and away from anarchy 
<BR>
(consider our propensity to form lines at public counters, etc. This is not 
<BR>
the case in many countries).
<BR>
<P>I could go on and on, but you get the idea.
<BR>
<P>To consider an analogy, 20 of us Extropians decided to open a business at a 
<BR>
great location (at a busy intersection here on the west side of Houston). We 
<BR>
find a great building with great improvements, etc. We each have an 
<BR>
office/wokshop in the building. We are all owners. The benefits of joint 
<BR>
ownership accrue toeach of us individually as owners. We may give away or 
<BR>
sell  all or part of our individual interests.
<BR>
<P>But then suppose three of us have a friend who isn't doing so well. These 
<BR>
three Extropians decide to cut their mutual friend in on the deal, for 
<BR>
reasons of their own (maybe the &quot;friend&quot; gives them sexual favors, who 
<BR>
knows? :-)). Anyway, they cut this friend in on the business. But as it 
<BR>
turns out, this &quot;friend&quot; competes directly with several of the other owners. 
<BR>
Therefore, the addition of the friend steals the benefits of the business 
<BR>
ownership from the other owners.
<BR>
<P>So, this is something to think about. Those partial owners in the USA who 
<BR>
accrue benefits from immigration (i.e., those who obtain significant 
<BR>
financial benefit from *buying* labor-- relatively &quot;wealthy&quot; people &amp; 
<BR>
business interests) would ostensibly want more immigration, while those who 
<BR>
sell labor-- all the rest of us--would wnat less immigration, unless we all 
<BR>
accrued benefits rom said immigration. I can think of one such example: 
<BR>
immigrant medical doctors; we all directly benefit from these immigrants. 
<BR>
Otherwise, a cost-benefit analysis would be in order.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, those who benefit from immigration (wealthy &amp; business 
<BR>
interests) have managed to &quot;propagandize&quot; this issue. But I am sure everyone 
<BR>
on this forum will deal with this issue in a completely rational fashion.
<BR>
Uh-huh...
