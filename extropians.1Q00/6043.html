</EM><BR>
<P><P>What to do with a billion dollars?
<BR>
Make the first Global Biocensus.
<BR>
<P>If we ever find life on another planet, the first thing we would do is to
<BR>
sysematically survey all the life on that planet. That's something we have
<BR>
never done for our own home planet.
<BR>
<P>This idea was sparked by listening to a money manager talk about his work.
<BR>
This guy only accepts clients with a minimum of US$1 billion to invest.
<BR>
Obviously, these people have problems we could only wish for.  But rather
<BR>
than a joke, this manager convinced me that handling a billion dollars was
<BR>
actually a difficult problem. Even giving away a billion dollars, he said,
<BR>
was extremely difficult -- the main problem being that you couldn't give it
<BR>
away responsibly fast enough not to have the remainder keep piling up. If
<BR>
you give it away too slowly (at less than 10% of capital per year), the
<BR>
principals accumalates gains faster than you spend it.  On the other hand
<BR>
to give it all away at once would require buying such an elaborate
<BR>
infrastructure to handle it that most of the money would go towards the
<BR>
infrastructure and not the problem. The question we posed was, if you had
<BR>
to give a billion dollars away fast and effectively, what would you do?
<BR>
<P>I was reminded of Ted Turners gift of a billion dollars to the UN. Ted
<BR>
obviously thought about this problem. His solution was to use the existing
<BR>
infrastructure of the UN. My laymans' view of the UN is as  one of the
<BR>
world's larger bureaucracies.  Efficiency is not what you associate with
<BR>
it. While the agenda of the UN is wholesome, was this really the best way
<BR>
to leverage $1 billion?  How much of that money will be spent on the UN
<BR>
infrastructure? Probably most of it.  The UN does good work, but safe,
<BR>
conventional, and needed work.  Part of Turner's point was that this should
<BR>
be funded by governments and not philanthropy.
<BR>
<P>I wanted to spend my billion dollar gift differently.
<BR>
<P>I was looking for a project that could be scaled up rapidly, that would get
<BR>
the money into places where the money would make a huge difference,  that
<BR>
would acomplish a GOOD THING, and that would spin out and enable all kinds
<BR>
of new wealth from its completion.
<BR>
<P>My idea is to take a billion dollars to make a bio census of the world. Use
<BR>
the money to fund the training of bright third world students and
<BR>
aboriginals to make a taxonomic survey of all creatures.  You could train
<BR>
people to scientifically collect and classify species in very specific
<BR>
areas in probably two years.  You could  develop a portable training
<BR>
program and kit to ship around the world in three years. You could use the
<BR>
internet to funnel the data. It would be in the public domain. At third
<BR>
world wages, there milght be enough to fund 3 years of collecting and
<BR>
identifying (or simply collecting and freezing for indentification later --
<BR>
this is Greg
<BR>
Bear's idea).
<BR>
<P>Does this global biocensus include the microbes? It might cost another
<BR>
couple of billion to do a complete microbial survey. This is the most
<BR>
commercially powerful aspect of the survey, so I don't think this part
<BR>
needs non-commercial funding. But the rest is best done with philanthropic
<BR>
money.
<BR>
<P>Here's what we'd get out of it:
<BR>
<P>The first global census of life on earth. Now.
<BR>
<P>Real cash trickling into the far corners of the earth.
<BR>
<P>Tens of thousands of people with a real job, at least temporarily.
<BR>
<P>Tens of thousands of people with a new familiarity with science.
<BR>
<P>Terabytes of data in the public domain, waiting to be built upon.
<BR>
<P>Hundreds of immediate, amazing auxillary discoveries, from lost ruins to
<BR>
&quot;extinct&quot; animals discovered.
<BR>
<P>A global training network that could be continued for this or other tasks.
<BR>
Thousands of companies, producing hundreds of million of dollars of value,
<BR>
dervived from the information collected.
<BR>
<P>Other surprises, gauranteed.
<BR>
<P>Most likely the billion dollars would generate a billion dollars of
<BR>
unexpected new value, in addition to the other social value it produces.
<BR>
For instance the tools created to make the survey possible could be used to
<BR>
survey other global questions.
<BR>
<P>In general, we have no answers to most global questions. We should count
<BR>
everything alive on earth.  In talking to biologists it turns out that such
<BR>
a global biocensus has never dared been tried.  How
<BR>
long will we live here before we find out who's here.
<BR>
<P>That's my fantasy.  Many other fantasies are possible.
<BR>
<P>So here are the rules. You have a billion dollars in cash and you have to
<BR>
spend it all in five years. You want maximum good. What do you do?
