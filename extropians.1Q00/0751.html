<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;All those salesfolk and skyscrapers are not mainly there to move stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt;from factories to your home, or even to design the things the factories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt;make.  They perform lots of other useful functions. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  What, though, when all is said and done?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you look at the &quot;average&quot; skyscraper its got a few financial
<BR>
services floors, a few legal floors, perhaps some doctors and
<BR>
dentists, maybe some publishing or other forms of entertainment, etc.
<BR>
<P>A big chunk of this is dedicated to helping you &quot;collect&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;maintain&quot; your &quot;wealth&quot;.  Much of the rest of it is dedicated to
<BR>
providing opportunities to use your wealth in interesting ways so you
<BR>
can convince yourself that you are &quot;happy&quot; and life is &quot;fun&quot;.
<BR>
[Kind of cynical today, I guess... :-)]
<BR>
<P>I haven't responded in detail to Damien's economic note yet (hopefully
<BR>
soon), but my general feeling is that the activity vector space contracts
<BR>
significantly (for humans) in the processes of producing stuff and
<BR>
defining &amp; regulating aspects of that production.  If we get a little
<BR>
more education (say everyone has a law degree), then human behavior may
<BR>
become more &quot;trustable&quot; (so you don't need the lawyers for most everyday
<BR>
stuff).  Now, in addition, everyone gets &quot;moderately wealthy&quot; (either by
<BR>
simply living long enough &amp; compounding investments or because NanoSantas
<BR>
take care of everyone's &quot;survival&quot; needs.  [Note, so that Robin doesn't
<BR>
jump on me I'm holding constant the # of copies of each of us.]  Since
<BR>
you are effectively much wealthier and you don't have &quot;current&quot; survival
<BR>
concerns, you become much less interested in the &quot;growth&quot; of wealth.
<BR>
<P>Since presumably some levels of Nanotech &amp; AI are available, that
<BR>
means the creativity space (and barriers to the expression thereof)
<BR>
expands *significantly*.  Furthermore, since we all have so much more
<BR>
free time, the need for &quot;fresh&quot; entertainment increases as well.
<BR>
<P>So my feeling is that a very large shift occurs from manufacturing,
<BR>
legal &amp; financial activities into create/design/test activities.
<BR>
I think people can easily see how the barriers between say &quot;art&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;mechanical engineering&quot; or &quot;programming&quot; and &quot;screenplay writing&quot; may
<BR>
breakdown and begin to merge.
<BR>
<P>Now the two monkey wrenches that get thrown at this perspective
<BR>
(as has been discussed before) are (a) a &quot;race&quot; for IA and/or endless
<BR>
copies and/or economic resource grabbing; and (b) the development of
<BR>
an AI that may have fundamentally different motivations or morals.
<BR>
<P>Some very interesting new job categories open up.  For example
<BR>
verifying that parts of dozens of nanodesigns can't be disassembled
<BR>
and reassembled to form universal destructor machines...  I could
<BR>
see us sucking up half the productive thought capacity (with sub-agents)
<BR>
on that single task alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of what the &quot;white collar&quot; world does is coordinate and facilitate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the needs, desires, abilities and resources of other people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, they create and adjust networks of people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably a better way of saying what I said.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Far from being replaced by hardware and software that facilitates 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this process, the demand for such services seems to GROW with the increase in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality of technological support for communication and information 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handling.
</EM><BR>
<P>Presumably as the complexity and comprehension grows, so to does the need
<BR>
for individuals managing the reliability of the interconnections and
<BR>
low level details of specific knowledge bases.  Now the interesting
<BR>
question becomes whether or not lawyers or financial services
<BR>
people &quot;graduate&quot; to &quot;programmers&quot; of reliable exchange or ROI agents.
<BR>
<P>Do we get squashed because the complexification of the Spike makes
<BR>
it chaotic enough that it implodes?  Or do we only let it grow
<BR>
in those regions where we can reliably manage it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems that people (and other intelligent economic actors) will continue to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value these functions even if we achieved true &quot;anything box&quot; technology.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Naturalment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Having already broken the direct link between money and atoms, this appears 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide all that is necessary to create the pathway for this phenomenon to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue on into an economy of superabundance. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Provided the complexity doesn't hang us!
