<P>
<EM>&gt; I haven't read the background material for the above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post and unless several someones say it is worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking at I don't intend to.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, you can keep count. I think the outline is worth
<BR>
skimming, especially the beginning. That would take
<BR>
you
<BR>
about a minute or so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thanks for the reference! This is one of the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascinating things I've seen in ages!
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds like another &quot;yes&quot; vote.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Was the article incorrect when it stated that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have gotten buckeyballs to function as waves? And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims they are similiar in diameter to DNA (not of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course in length :-). 
</EM><BR>
<P>The article is not incorrect about experiments in
<BR>
which
<BR>
buckeyballs display wave-particle duality. Of course,
<BR>
the two-slit experiment (shooting things through a
<BR>
vacuum at two slits) is rather far removed from
<BR>
conditions in the cell.
<BR>
<P>HOWEVER, as the outline points out, it is only certain
<BR>
small sections of a DNA molecule which need to
<BR>
experience quantum effects for quantum evolution to be
<BR>
a possibility, not the entire molecule, and the scale
<BR>
involved is similar to scales in which quantum effects
<BR>
have long been known to effect chemistry, with
<BR>
molecular structures of molecules being a
<BR>
superposition of two or more possible structures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm rather sceptical; there are other possibilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for how adaptive mutations could be favored 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad Anders brought that up, because quantum
<BR>
evolution's potential to be one explanation for
<BR>
adaptive mutations is one of the reasons why it's
<BR>
worth looking into. Of course, many
<BR>
still dispute the evidence that adaptive mutations
<BR>
exist.
<BR>
<P>(If quantum evolution survives scrutiny and becomes
<BR>
widely accepted, the scientists who steadfastly denied
<BR>
that adaptive mutations were taking place will quietly
<BR>
change their minds, usually without admitting they
<BR>
were wrong.)
