<EM>&gt; I've always thought one of the interesting *nits* in the legal

<EM>&gt; system is the concept of Judgement by one's &quot;peers&quot;.  Does that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that I get a jury of Extropians?  Or do I get a jury where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the people watch Days of our Lives, Jerry Springer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and WWF all day?
</EM><BR>
<P>It means that you get a trial by people with randomly-distributed
<BR>
positions in the social power structure, as opposed to a trial by your
<BR>
local duke.  Your relative intelligence and viewing habits are entirely
<BR>
irrelevant to this principle.  What matters is that you're not being
<BR>
tried by an aristocracy, by the same people who pass the laws, or by any
<BR>
other power group that might have an interest in convicting you.  I
<BR>
suppose the jury selection process could theoretically wind up with your
<BR>
being tried entirely by members of the state legislature or some other
<BR>
power group, but to create social stability it only has to work most of
<BR>
the time.
<BR>
<P>Sure, &quot;the public&quot;, in the genuine sense of twelve random people picked
<BR>
off the street, might count as a power group interested in imposing an
<BR>
injustice on you.  This does constitute an undesirable flaw in the
<BR>
system, but the system does work fairly well, it was a major improvement
<BR>
over the previous system, and there is no obvious way to eliminate said
<BR>
flaw without introducing other ones.  After all, twelve random people
<BR>
off the street have a private interest in putting murderers in jail; how
<BR>
do you distinguish between this and the private interest involved in
<BR>
racial or religious hate?  The Constitutional answer, that there has to
<BR>
be a law passed by a deliberative body *and* a willing jury, is probably
<BR>
as close as you can get without an observer-independent method of
<BR>
distinguishing between good laws and bad laws.
