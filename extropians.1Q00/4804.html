<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20near%20anything%20boxes%20allowed%20to%20br%20in%20the%20hands%20of%20the%20public?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000314024618.98852.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not true that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; NRA opposes any attempt reduce the production of new guns?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The federal government is not permitted to control the quantity of guns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produced except under martial law conditions. The government does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make the guns, it is a private industry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your statement does not negate the truth of mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is it not true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the NRA is opposed to reducing the number of guns now in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Gun buybacks have been shown to have absolutely no effect on crime. Gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confiscations would obviously start a civil war.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, your statement does not negate the truth of mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is it not true that there are more guns in America than there are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Americans?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No there are not. There are over 250 million Americans, and between 200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and 240 million guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you get this statistic?  What is the date of it?  And even if it is 
<BR>
accurate, what practical difference does it make?  Especially when you 
<BR>
consider that a fair percentage of the Americans included in the statistic 
<BR>
consist of children, infants, invalids, convicts and ex-convicts?  Even 
<BR>
assuming the accuracy of your statistic, surely the number of guns far 
<BR>
outnumbers the number of sane, competent and law-abiding adults who are 
<BR>
legally permitted to own them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;   Is it not true that the NRA sees no problem with the ratio of guns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people?  Please stop me when I've said something that is not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ok, I have stopped you. The only people who see a problem with this are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those that think that Americans have no right to keep and bear arms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Such people are fascists and should be treated as such.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, your statement does not negate the truth of mine.  Furthermore, your 
<BR>
statement is untrue.  I think there is a problem with a country that 
<BR>
contains more guns than legal gun-owners.  Especially when that country 
<BR>
compounds that problem by a complete failure to make these dangerous 
<BR>
instrumentalities as safe as they can practically be, and the fact that gun 
<BR>
owners unnecessarily enjoy more anonymity than car owners.  Japan does not 
<BR>
allow every wacko in the country to own a gun.  Does that make the Japanese 
<BR>
government a fascist regime?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;The tree of liberty, from time to time, needs to be watered with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blood of tyrants and patriots.&quot;  - Thomas Jefferson
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  But it bothers me that it is usually the 2nd Amendment hardliners 
<BR>
who feel that they get to do the watering.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Isn't this fun?
</EM><BR>
<P>Marginally.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
