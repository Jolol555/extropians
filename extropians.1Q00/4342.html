John, you really need to get that this isn't going to work.  The people
<BR>
who want to play with &quot;everything&quot; boxes will simply move someplace else!
<BR>
We either have to go to a complete police state where even your thoughts are
<BR>
monitored or else develop the means of trusting people and their creations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the name of public safety and national security, we may never be allowed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these replicators within our homes in the first place.  The gov't and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate powers may say, &quot;come to us, and for a &quot;nominal&quot; charge we will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create what you want.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This doesn't solve anything.  I can spend my time on my computer
<BR>
designing those things I want, take a fast ship to some remote
<BR>
asteroid and build it, then send it back to dismantle Earth.
<BR>
Do you *really* think once Zyvex or IBM has announced that diamondoid
<BR>
nanoassembly is possible that dozens of people won't start working on
<BR>
building their own!!!  This isn't nuclear-tech where you need an actual
<BR>
uranium mine.  The raw materials (C) can be extracted from the air for
<BR>
heaven's sake.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Underground groups would have massive federal resources allocated against 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, to put them behind bars.  The hacker hunts would pale by comparison.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nano would be used to violate civil liberties that would be reminiscient of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the war on drugs but more clandestine and for that reason even more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatening to people's rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
For you to have massive Federal resources, you have to have massive
<BR>
&quot;funding&quot; for the hunters.  After everyone has stopped paying taxes
<BR>
and/or left the U.S. if it gets too intrusive, *who* do you think
<BR>
is going to do the &quot;hunting&quot;?  Only if you have AIs that are cheap
<BR>
and tireless will this possibly resemble what might happen.
<BR>
<P>Do you think that any government will survive that tries to imprison
<BR>
its population and force them to pay taxes in an era when this is
<BR>
unnecessary?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My hope is that home nanoreplicator technology will develop very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incrementally and we will see it gain a foothold in the private citizen's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realm that will not be possible to reverse.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its already impossible to reverse.  There are so many paths to nanoreplicators
<BR>
of various kinds (the phase space for the chemistry of nanoassembly
<BR>
of various materials is huge) that the government *cannot* stop this
<BR>
without killing just about everyone with an above average IQ.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; May corporate greed and the forces of capitalism triumph in this area!
</EM><BR>
<P>I think &quot;corporations&quot; as we currently imagine them are probably pretty
<BR>
doomed as well.  I would guess that perhaps only the entertainment
<BR>
conglomerates and perhaps education or tourism promoters will survive
<BR>
in the long run.  &quot;Classical&quot; corporations may do ok during the interim
<BR>
period until everyone has all of their basic survival needs met, but after
<BR>
that there is going to be a big restructuring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With capitalistic inducements, proper safeguards and no individual or group 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overcoming them to do something really vicious as an excuse for the gov't, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we may see our dreams come true.
</EM><BR>
<P>For a group to cause trouble, you need to make a case for *what* would
<BR>
motivate them to cause trouble.  Increased wealth and mobility should
<BR>
give people the ability to simply avoid or transcend the things that
<BR>
have motivated trouble makers in the past (oppression, taxation,
<BR>
prejudice, etc.).  Only if we get some loony-tunes religious or
<BR>
anarchist terror groups that think their way is the only way will
<BR>
we have something to worry about.  Its not the average wo/man you
<BR>
need to worry about, its the people who would want to control *all*
<BR>
of us that are a concern.
