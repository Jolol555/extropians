<P>I am both a believer in God and a cryonicist.  I would say many things 
<BR>
happen that are against God's will but God gives humanity free will.  I 
<BR>
realize you are talking about scientist's getting on &quot;God's turf.&quot;  I am a 
<BR>
believer in the near-death experience phenomena but do not know how that 
<BR>
fits in with cryonics.  I would think the spirit would &quot;sleep&quot; along with 
<BR>
the body while it is frozen.
<BR>
<P>It would be quite something if a suspendee's spirit left him or her to go to 
<BR>
the spirit world only to  be recalled at reanimation!  This would make for 
<BR>
the ultimate NDE story.  But based on what I have read often NDE's are 
<BR>
forgotten quickly by the person who experiences them after regaining 
<BR>
consciousness.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, I think we must use our free will to safeguard our own lives.  
<BR>
If we want to live a long life it is up to us to eat right, exercise, have 
<BR>
medical exams regularly, buckle up and do the other things that are key to 
<BR>
prolonging life.
<BR>
<P>The way I believe, God knows exactly how our lives will turn out but we do 
<BR>
not and still really do have free will.  So he doesn't control the time of 
<BR>
our death in most cases but knows it.  I have read accounts of people who 
<BR>
were &quot;called home&quot; to the other side because they were needed for some task 
<BR>
in the spirit world.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So I'm not worried that my feeble attempts will somehow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thwart God's cosmic plan.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I think God gives you free will when it comes to what you do with 
<BR>
your life.  It may or may not be against God's will to be cryonically 
<BR>
suspended but I do not think he is going to stop you regardless.
<BR>
<P>A concern I have had in terms of God's cosmic plans for this world in 
<BR>
general (not just me) is that if the fundamentalist interpretations of 
<BR>
Revelation are correct then my suspended body may be destroyed in what is 
<BR>
known as the tribulation period which will involve many different forms of 
<BR>
catastrophe which will include earthquake and plague.
<BR>
<P>Another possibility is that we could be reanimated into a world that is 
<BR>
experiencing the temporary peace and prosperity the Bible predicts before 
<BR>
the tribulation begins.  We would think we were in a utopia only to see the 
<BR>
world go crazy.  Actually, I find this scenario rather exciting compared to 
<BR>
the former!  I have thought at times that the strange weapons and creatures 
<BR>
described by some Bible interpretations could only  be products of mature 
<BR>
A.I. and nanotech.
<BR>
<P>I have enjoyed thinking about the matters you brought up.  I must confess I 
<BR>
should have been in church while I was writing this!  I will definitely have 
<BR>
to attend next week.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
