Old-fashioned &quot;big religion&quot; used to be, among other things, for the 
<BR>
function of bringing together people of dissimilar economic and cultural 
<BR>
interests, and it's hard to see how small sectarian religions can do this 
<BR>
very well.

<P>In my sociology of religion class the professor taught that a primary 
<BR>
positive social benefit of religion (judeo-christianity in the U.S.) was to 
<BR>
integrate people into the middle-class by instilling in them certain values 
<BR>
about work and education along with a social group to reinforce these 
<BR>
things.  It was a great class taught by a former Roman Catholic priest who 
<BR>
left the cloth to raise a family but is still a devout Catholic.  He still 
<BR>
could be very objective in his teaching.  This prof was the only one in his 
<BR>
department without a doctorate but could teach better then most I have seen.
