If the informational equality is perfect - i.e., with margins of error 
<BR>
substantially below the ordinary &quot;noise level&quot; of the brain's computational 
<BR>
environment - then both sets of atoms have an equally strong claim to being 
<BR>
the &quot;real you&quot;. They are both the original. They are both copies. The atoms 
<BR>
are irrelevant.

(end)

<P>This is the classic identity question that someone like Max More would be so 
<BR>
good at addressing.  I understand what you mean when you say they are 'both' 
<BR>
the original in terms of fully being that person
<BR>
in every way.
<BR>
<P>The cultural, legal and sociological questions here are what could make the 
<BR>
head spin.  How does the perfect copy deal with memories of beloved 
<BR>
relatives that may spurn him or her?  Should the copy have the right to 
<BR>
legally claim half of the financial resources of the person who was the 
<BR>
original template?  Time for a divorce? lol!  What mechanisms would society 
<BR>
put into place to make sure this technology and the people spawned from it 
<BR>
would not be abused? And finally, how would Eliezer #1 get along with 
<BR>
Eliezer #2? ;)
<BR>
