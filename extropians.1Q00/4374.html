<P>
The problem with this discussion is that it assumes a binary
<BR>
situation: first we have a situation similar to today economically and
<BR>
politically, and then we have a situation where there are
<BR>
near-anything boxes around. No wonder that things get messy. This
<BR>
scenario doesn't strike me as particulary realistic, and will likely
<BR>
just mislead our thinking.
<BR>
<P>Instead, imagine a gradual transition that can be more or less fast:
<BR>
first expensive nanotech in the lab, then expensive nanotech for
<BR>
biomedical and chip applications, then industrial nanotech, then
<BR>
consumer nanotech products and eventually consumer near-anything
<BR>
boxes. This transition will cause political and economic changes
<BR>
almost from the start, and how people respond to them will shape what
<BR>
regulations will be put on the boxes and by whom.
<BR>
<P>A comparision with computers might be relevant: they are the
<BR>
near-anything boxes of our era. I can run software on my computer for
<BR>
entertainment or for cyber-terrorism, write academic papers or pirate
<BR>
software and spread libel, and so on. How well has the currently
<BR>
strong Powers That Be managed to control the computer? So far attempts
<BR>
to institute limitations in hardware and software have failed
<BR>
miserably, both due to technical workarounds but mainly consumer
<BR>
protest. The law has tried to keep up but it has not worked well, and
<BR>
even if something is banned (say distributed denial of service
<BR>
software or anthrax recipes) there is no reason to expect it to
<BR>
vanish.
<BR>
<P>The computer was not an unexpected development, but the consequences
<BR>
were. Once there was enough linked computers around they became very
<BR>
hard to regulate and control. I think this hints at what might occur
<BR>
in a nanotech society: nanotech development is totally expected
<BR>
(*already* some business people are hyping it!), but the implications
<BR>
of widespread nanofacture will be so broad that the consequences will
<BR>
be hard to manage - and that is just industrial nanofacture, not
<BR>
private nanofacture. 
<BR>
<P>If the transition to nanotech is sufficiently slow rules and rulers
<BR>
might keep up, but to actually control something like that is likely
<BR>
just as hard as controlling the Internet. Ubiquitious surveillance and
<BR>
similar draconian measures *might* do it, but that assumes voters and
<BR>
consumers accept it, which is doubtful (not impossible to sell given
<BR>
enough time and work, but there are bound to be strong interests
<BR>
against it). If the transition is faster than they can keep up with,
<BR>
something that seems to have happened for most other radical
<BR>
technologies (computers, genetic engineering etc) then they will not
<BR>
be in any position to instate working controls anyway.
<BR>
<P>My estimate will be that any controls on near-anything boxes will be
<BR>
put in by the manufacturer (or rather, design company). People will
<BR>
likely want some security locks so that their children do not
<BR>
nanofacture guns or they themselves accidentally dial sulphuric
<BR>
acid. But these will likely be variable and model-dependent.
<BR>
<P>Of course, a lot in this discussion assumes there are recipes for
<BR>
near-anything easily available on the net. That might take much longer
<BR>
than the spread of the boxes.
<BR>
