I said...

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  What are viruses for? What positive contribution to they make to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  biosphere?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>someone else said...
<BR>
viruses are not FOR anything.  There is no divine plan.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Viruses contain genes.  Genes are the primary unit of biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replication.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Replicators replicate.....end of story...
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the lecture...I'm pleased that you are brilliant. I guess
<BR>
language has ceased to be a very useful tool.
<BR>
<P>Elizabeth Childs said...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but it's an interesting question when you phrase it this way instead:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;If we destroyed all viruses, would any other form of life be negatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effected?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that's an interesting question, because we may some day have the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do it.  And if the answer is &quot;no,&quot; then it would be in human being's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interests to destroy all viruses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that what you meant, <A HREF="mailto:dgobel@doubled.com?Subject=Re:%20Viruses&In-Reply-To=&lt;00db01bf6754$9ba6b1d0$0201a8c0@doubled.com&gt;">dgobel@doubled.com</A>?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>I say...I like your reformulation of the question, and appreciate you
<BR>
extension of kindness. If most/all living things on Earth are DNA/RNA based,
<BR>
and they are part of an ecocosm, and each component of the ecocosm
<BR>
formulates appropriate adaptive responses to competition and cooperation
<BR>
from other DNA based lifeforms - What if any cooperative (from the human's
<BR>
selfish conscious standpoint) activities/eventualities accrue
<BR>
amongst/between viruses and mammals (specifically human cause that's what I
<BR>
am). My first question was simpler and easily parsed. This question is
<BR>
vastly more specific, but frankly adds no new info.
<BR>
<P>As an example of possible benefits, I have heard it postulated that viruses
<BR>
may provide a mechanism for the injection of novel DNA into otherwise stable
<BR>
mammalian genomes, and that action if true, may contribute to longer term
<BR>
species viability, but I have never heard whether this was confirmed or
<BR>
experimentally proved untrue.
<BR>
<P>Now for the REASON for the question...most research on viruses focus on the
<BR>
ideopatic/pathologically negative to humans action of viruses. What if there
<BR>
are massively useful but extraordinarily subtle benefits that viruses convey
<BR>
to humans about which we are totally ignorant. Is there any research on
<BR>
this? If no one is looking here, my intuition is that it would yield
<BR>
incredible fruit.
