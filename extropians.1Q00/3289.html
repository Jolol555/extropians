<EM>&gt; Uh, do you you have actual numbers for this brash assertion? Are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claiming that essentially all patients are suspended after one hour or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less after death has occured (not pronounced)? Don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heavens, no.  I'm merely claiming that it is hard to die in such a way that
<BR>
you can't be suspended.  If you die of an illness, you'll probably be at a
<BR>
hospital when it happens.  If you die in an accident, odds are there will at
<BR>
least be paramedics on the scene by the time you go.  Since they do check
<BR>
for organ donor ID, that gives you an excellent chance of ending up frozen.
<BR>
<P>Of course, you could always get buried in an avalanche, or die while scuba
<BR>
diving, or otherwise manage to evade the emergency medical care system, but
<BR>
the number of people who go out this way is a very small fraction of the
<BR>
total death rate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This sentence is insoncistent. Clearly there is physical damage that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is irrepairable (say, incineration, or a week stored at RT) which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroys essentially all information about a particular individuum.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was simply that information preservation is the only thing that
<BR>
matters.  Damage that makes you look really messed up, but does not actually
<BR>
destroy information, won't affect your chances of being reconstructed by
<BR>
mature nanotechnology.  This is an important point because information loss
<BR>
is not visible to the naked eye, and it is quite easy to rack up lots of
<BR>
nasty-looking but irrelevant incidental damage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Now, what people tend to overlook is that the problem of deducing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; original information content of a scrambled brain is isomorphic to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; problem of deducing the information content of an encrypted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message.  Given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another assertion. Based on what?
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought that one was obvious.  Well, let's try a comparison:
<BR>
<P>When decrypting a message, you have an unknown body of information (the
<BR>
message) that is known to be organized according to certain rules (the
<BR>
language of the message).  The information has been subjected to some
<BR>
complex series of nonrandom transformations (encryption), and the object of
<BR>
the exercise is to reverse those transformations and recover the original
<BR>
state of the information.
<BR>
<P>When reconstructing the mind of a cryonicist, you have an unknown body of
<BR>
information (the patient's memories and personality) that is known to be
<BR>
organized according to certain rules (human neurology and psychology).  The
<BR>
information has been subjected to some complex series of nonrandom
<BR>
transformations (ischemic injury and freezing damage), and the object of the
<BR>
exercise is to reverse those transformations and recover the original state
<BR>
of the information.
<BR>
<P>Do you see a problem with one of the comparisons here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, you're already immortal. Why bothering with a suspension at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all? Future science will reconstruct yourself from trajectories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmospheric CO2. Or from a piece of apple pie, whatever is closer at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hand.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, right.  Thermal noise *is* random, and no known or projected
<BR>
cryptographic technique would be capable of reversing it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah, right.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I knew cryonics was a religion, but I never saw it demonstrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so clearly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Come now, Eugene, you can do better than that.  We've got plenty of
<BR>
experience with advanced cryptography to draw on, thanks to the cold war.
<BR>
We've had people break seemingly solid codes time and again, by exploiting
<BR>
the tiniest nonrandom features of the encryption technology.  I'm merely
<BR>
claiming that we can apply the same mathematical techniques to the task of
<BR>
deducing the original state of a frozen brain.
<BR>
<P>Ischemic injury, AFAIK, is a very complex but highly ordered cascade of
<BR>
chemical reactions.  It seems perfectly plausible that you could simulate
<BR>
the process in reverse to figure out what the original tissue looked like.
<BR>
The same is true of freezing damage.  Using cryptographic analysis is just a
<BR>
different way of performing the same computation, like using a neural net
<BR>
instead of a procedural algorithm.
<BR>
<P>Or maybe it was the rock-on-the-head comment that got you?  But all we're
<BR>
talking about there is low-velocity collisions - we could simulate that now
<BR>
if the number of particles involved weren't so large.  It only gets tricky
<BR>
if there is enough energy involved to give you chaotic phenomena like
<BR>
turbulence, and even that might not be a show-stopper.  After all, we've had
<BR>
at least one code broken because it used local barometric pressure readings
<BR>
to seed its random number generator, and weather is pretty darn chaotic too.
