&nbsp;writes, in his continuing &quot;viruses&quot; thread:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now for the REASON for the question...most research on viruses focus on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideopatic/pathologically negative to humans action of viruses. What if there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are massively useful but extraordinarily subtle benefits that viruses convey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to humans about which we are totally ignorant. Is there any research on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this? If no one is looking here, my intuition is that it would yield
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incredible fruit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dave G
</EM><BR>
<P>You original post got me to thinking.  My feeling is that all the bits and
<BR>
pieces of the &quot;ecocosm&quot;--as you so aptly call it--play a range of roles,
<BR>
both cooperative and competitive, so looking for the beneficial role for
<BR>
viruses strikes me as a bit of good outside-the-box logic.
<BR>
<P>An online search found the following in Dartmouth's online Virology &quot;text&quot;:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Some scientists believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viruses evolved out of cells,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gradually losing so much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their genetic information that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they became dependent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other cells for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduction, or alternatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they arose from bits of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic material within the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cell that acquired a life of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own. Other scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that viruses originated and evolved along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the most primitive forms of life, the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; molecules that gained self-replicating abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of these took the form of cells - others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolved into the viruses which parasitized those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same cells. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; There are a number of complex molecular life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forms that blur the boundaries [between] cells and viruses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are pieces of self-replicating genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material found in bacteria, called episomes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which evolve independently of their hosts, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can even move from [one] host to another - but carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic information that is beneficial or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; essential to their host. Many bacteria would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unable to reproduce at all without them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Episomes are in many ways quite similar to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viruses - except for the fact that they only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduce themselves when their hosts do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whereas viruses reproduce themselves hundreds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of times, causing disease.
</EM><BR>
<P>and this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Viroids and virusoids are the smallest and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplest form of all recognized viruses and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-replicating molecules. Viroids are composed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of nothing more than a single, circular strand of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic material, and cause disease in plant cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Replicating in the nuclei of plant cells, they often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cause striking diseases in their host plants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lacking even a protective shell of protein,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viroids do not even spread easily from one cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or plant to another. Virusoids, like viroids, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small, circular molecules of genetic material.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virusoids &quot;infect&quot; other viruses, using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replication processes of the host virus to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replicate themselves instead. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;From the 13 OCTOBER 1999 issue of EurekAlert I found the article
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    New University of Georgia study indicates possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    ancient origin for retroviruses, the class to which HIV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    belongs
</EM><BR>
<P>wherein I found the following: 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Retroviruses and related free-moving pieces of genetic material called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    retrotransposons are extremely important in the genetic makeup of
</EM><BR>
plants and animals,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    despite the fact they were not discovered until about 50 years ago.
</EM><BR>
For example, half
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    of the maize genome is made up of retroelements, and in some plants
</EM><BR>
such as wheat
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    and pine trees, 90 percent of the genome may be constructed around
</EM><BR>
these &quot;movable
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    genes.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Researchers now believe that these &quot;retroelements&quot; are major causes of
</EM><BR>
genetic
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    mutations and are significant factors in genome evolution. McDonald's
</EM><BR>
laboratory and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    several others are using the relatively new science of genomics to
</EM><BR>
study how these
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    elements have changed plants and animals. By analyzing the sequences
</EM><BR>
of nucleic
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    acids in certain genomes, they can better understand which
</EM><BR>
retroelements have been
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    highly conserved through species and over time.
</EM><BR>
<P>All of which suggests to me--if I may speculate somewhat brashly--that,
<BR>
since a virus is fundamentally a dna transfer vehicle, it may have
<BR>
originated during the early evolution of &quot;proto&quot;-bacteria as a
<BR>
meta-reproduction strategy.  Back when kt was an rna world, broadcasting
<BR>
your rna, which then claims a place on the genome of &quot;the other&quot;, is very
<BR>
much in line with the selfish gene theory of evolution.  However, looking
<BR>
at this last sentence,  &quot;selfish&quot; doesn't seem quite right, when everyone
<BR>
is promiscuously shuffling bits of genetic material about, and &quot;your rna&quot;
<BR>
seems equally questionable, when each individual is a one-off mish mash of
<BR>
the various bits and pieces floating around.
<BR>
<P>Great question Dave.  You're absolutely right.  We've gotta get past the
<BR>
virus-as-bad-guy prejudice, and start seeing them as
<BR>
direct-to-your-pore-step (as in cell pore) delivery, courtesy of Feral
<BR>
Express.
<BR>
<P>Of course the recombinant gene folks are already hip to this.
<BR>
