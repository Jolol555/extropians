<EM>&gt; Robert J. Bradbury...There are something like 300+ people on this list and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seldom see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than a handful stepping into the muck and coming out to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow the caked on mud to dry in the sun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   ...&quot;You must begin by being there.&quot;..
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow this was a way cool post Robert, thanks!  {8-]
<BR>
You have put me into idea-hampster mode.
<BR>
<P>The article in Business Week went on and on about internet
<BR>
privacy and how companies can set cookies, snoop on ones
<BR>
internet habits, etc. without their knowledge and perhaps even
<BR>
without their consent.  The article then went on to propose
<BR>
several solutions, but they seemed too lawey for my tastes: pass
<BR>
a law to do this, pass a law to do that.
<BR>
<P>NO LAWS!  Ive a better idea.  Some of you programmer gurus
<BR>
could likely write us a java script that would go log onto the
<BR>
internet at say 0400 (after sending out several hundred fake
<BR>
emails) and go to some random website, collecting cookies, then
<BR>
go on to some random link on that site, collect cookies, and
<BR>
so on.  One would collect jillions of cookies that would not
<BR>
only tell the snoopy marketers nothing, it would corrupt their
<BR>
existing databases.  If you, kind guru, wrote such a script and
<BR>
gave it away to the proletariate, privacy would be created
<BR>
spontaneously by burying everyone's true actions under a
<BR>
morass of false clickstreams.
<BR>
<P>How about it programmers?  Can it be done?  spike
<BR>
<P>{Hey this is pretty good stuff, coming from the original
<BR>
info-nudist, eh?  {8^D  }
