<P>I responded:

<EM>&gt;[In principle, science] could find out everything that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would ever think about ethics under any circumstances.  And isn't that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the closest Dan Fabulich could ever get to knowing what is ethical? Sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there might be some things about right and wrong that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could never know.  But no other approach to ethics could possibly reveal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more to Dan Fabulich than this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dan replied:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;True enough, but we'll never HAVE a magic wand like this. The prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would surely affect my way of thinking about ethics, so the prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would have to not only model my thoughts on the matter but its own effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on my thoughts on the matter.

<P>[The conversation continued for two more posts, but let me return to here.]
<BR>
<P>It seems you have granted that your first statement was wrong.  Everything
<BR>
we can know about ethics *is* in principle learnable via science.  You
<BR>
might claim that progress in this science will be terribly slow, or that
<BR>
it will stop at some fundamental limit to scientific progress.  But I
<BR>
dispute this skepticism if it is mainly based on the possibility that
<BR>
people will react to learning the theories that describe them.  This is
<BR>
the standard situation in cognitive and social sciences, and yet these
<BR>
sciences are making great progress.
<BR>
<P>Of course you could flip this argument around.  You could accept that ethics
<BR>
is subsumed by science, and yet argue that traditional approaches to ethics
<BR>
are a faster route to progress in this area than traditional approaches in
<BR>
other sciences.  Maybe the fastest way to find out what you will think is to
<BR>
just think.  But in principle, it isn't the only way.
