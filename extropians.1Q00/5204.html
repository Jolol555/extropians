Robert Owen:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is truly astonishing that, after the perhaps 2,500-year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;documentation of the human tendency to inflict violence on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his own kind to achieve merely selfish ends, we still listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who advocate that some personal acquisitive desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be regarded as superordinate to the welfare of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;community upon which this individual depends. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of privilege is forfeit by those whose very polemics are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grounded in social indifference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
If we substitute &quot;God&quot; for &quot;society&quot; in this paragraph we get
<BR>
something that - to me- is indistinguishable from religious
<BR>
enthusiasm.  
<BR>
<P>Are you confident that the active agents of society are accurately
<BR>
mapped to society itself?  I don't deny that many perceive that as an
<BR>
achievable goal but I do believe it's going to take a lot of antenna
<BR>
rubbing and pheromone squirting before it comes to pass.
<BR>
<P>I've generally pursued, and generally been at spiritual ease with,
<BR>
&quot;merely selfish ends,&quot; but I'm perfectly willing to compromise on this
<BR>
issue.  We'll split it down the middle.  _You_ get to define the means
<BR>
and resources employed to achieve desireable social goals and _I_ get
<BR>
to define the goals.  Report back here next week.
