Meanwhile, however, the national Murdoch newspaper The Australian outdid 
<BR>
itself with a color supplement showing on the cover a patchwork girl andthe 
<BR>
inevitable brainless heading: FRANKENSCIENCE. In the land of Greg Egan, 
<BR>
unknown to most of his fellow citizens, this is vomit-making.

<BR>
<P>What did you expect?? lol  Murdoch to me is a throwback to an extent of 
<BR>
those media moguls a century ago who would say anything in a headline to 
<BR>
sell papers.  It sounds like the show you were on went well, 
<BR>
congratulations.
<BR>
<P>I was touched by your stories about how war has touched your family.  I am 
<BR>
sorry.  Whether fighting on the frontline or building the tools of war we 
<BR>
all contribute to it.  But these people were in the second world-war?  That 
<BR>
was at least a 'good' war to stop tyranny.  Perhaps what is right for 
<BR>
Australia is simply not right for the United States, at least to my mind.
<BR>
<P>later:
<BR>
Actually most New Zealanders are women

<BR>
<P>Why is that?  Where have the men gone?
