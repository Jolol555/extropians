<P><EM>&gt; *I'm* no tax lawyer either, but I really must take exception to Greg's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  supposition.  Tax lawyers provide a *very* valuable and commendable 
</EM><BR>
service 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  by helping citizens to find the lowest legal tax possible.  Granted, tax 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lawyers indirectly benefit from a complex and burdensome tax code.  They 
</EM><BR>
do 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  not cause it, however, and do much to help we victims of it to reduce its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  harms--and the tax revenue flowing to statists.
</EM><BR>
<P>While that's true, there would be FAR, FAR fewer tax lawyers in anything like 
<BR>
a fair system of law.  The reason we have such a damnably complex tax system 
<BR>
is because, once you start making &quot;tax policy&quot;, the legislature becomes a 
<BR>
trading floor for narrow, special interests and hidden wealth redistribution. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Since all tax policy is really redistribution of wealth, I've often thought 
<BR>
a worthwhile fundamental constitutional provision would be &quot;NO TAX POLICY&quot;: 
<BR>
Raise money with taxes and spend it openly, or don't tax or spend at all.

<P><EM>&gt; So if you and I bought houses in Bay Area 50 years ago for $30K apiece,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and now want to swap them (while they have the estimated market value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of $1M each), each of us will have to pay about $300,000 ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And for that, each of us would have to sell the house and move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to some God-forgotten area like Boston?
</EM><BR>
<P>In theory, this seems like it would be the result, since you &quot;realized your 
<BR>
gain&quot; (but see below).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  What if people swap &quot;usage rights&quot;.  I still &quot;own&quot; my house,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and you owe yours, but we swap usage rights for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Shadow ownership of sorts.   Same for everything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  You still &quot;own&quot; the groceries, I am just digesting them  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, this can give rise to one of the cleverest tax dodges I've ever 
<BR>
heard of.  You and I buy cars, only I buy the car you want and you buy the 
<BR>
car I want.  Now I lease the car you bought and visa versa.  We each claim 
<BR>
the car we have title to as a business asset for our &quot;leasing business&quot;, 
<BR>
which we can then depreciate.  It actually works.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  (Maybe the govt. could also collect its duties in barter?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  For every 3 family members you would have to host one bureaucrat)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd rather pay cash

<P><EM>&gt; Capital gains on home sales, so far as I know, are not incurred if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  money is re-invested back into real estate, if its a primary home, or if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you put that money into oil well exploration (wildcatting).
</EM><BR>
<P>I know the former is true, but I'm not sure about the latter (although I 
<BR>
should, being a Texan.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of the strategies that I know works in tax court when you get nabbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for not paying taxes: You are not obligated to obey a law you or an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  average citizen cannot understand. Simply cart in a whole copy of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tax code (somewhere in the tens of thousands of pages), and ask the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  judge if he expects an average citizen to understand this law in whole.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Its really great when you use some passages of the tax code which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  50% cross references to other regulations and codes, with lots of if,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ands/ors, etc... Let the judge try to read these passages and ask him if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  he understands what it means. Such cases are dismissed at this point.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never heard of this and, with respect, it sounds bogus.  A whole lot of 
<BR>
the tax code is dense, impenetrable &quot;code-speak&quot;.  If this argument worked, 
<BR>
I'd expect we wouldn't have to pay much in the way of taxes at all.
<BR>
<P>But I'm not going to say anything more about tax law.  Someone needs to 
<BR>
create a corporation or blow up a refinery, so I'll know what I'm talking 
<BR>
about . . .
