<EM>&gt; Last on the

<EM>&gt; list is probably organizations like Zyvex, for the very reasons you

<EM>&gt; mentioned: who's going to invest in a company that may eventually make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment irrelevant?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I'll be very blunt about this.  I and any number of other entrepreneurs
<BR>
would certainly invest in companies like Zyvex for a number of reasons.
<BR>
We will start with the club of the super-rich (with whom I've had
<BR>
some experience)... In these realms, it isn't whether you make money
<BR>
but whether you get &quot;bragging rights&quot; or whether your trounce the
<BR>
opposition.  Being &quot;right&quot; about nanotech will be a very unique
<BR>
position indeed.  Second, you have the techies with more money than
<BR>
they know how to spend (witness Internet stocks &amp; open source)...
<BR>
These people will invest simply because its *way cool*.  Third
<BR>
you have the average &quot;aware&quot; investor who knows that while patents
<BR>
are good, market inertia is better.  You show me a company like
<BR>
Zyvex with a one-year to assembler time frame and a marketing
<BR>
department like Coca-cola's and my wallet is open.  In the times
<BR>
of the singularity, there are really big payoffs for whomever gets
<BR>
there first.
<BR>
<P>Now IBM certainly has more resources than Zyvex, but Zyvex is much
<BR>
more focused than IBM.  In my experience, necessity is the mother
<BR>
of invention.  The stock options for the Zyvex employees are potentially
<BR>
worth a lot more than the stock options of the IBM teams.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I would strongly disagree with the perspective that once
<BR>
we have a nanoassembler, the nanosantas descend on our door steps.
<BR>
I've said it before and I'll say it again -- the limiting factors
<BR>
are the *designs*.  If I had a nanoassembler tomorrow it wouldn't
<BR>
make my life any better because I haven't got a damn thing to build
<BR>
with it.
<BR>
<P>Go do the combinatorics of designing billion-to-trillion atom machines.
<BR>
We aren't even close to having the computer power to predict the
<BR>
things we could build will operate as designed.  We do however
<BR>
have a pretty clear path to getting this power.
<BR>
<P>Having a nanoassembler is nice.  Having an AI nanomachine design
<BR>
program is much, much more valuable.
