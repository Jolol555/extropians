<EM>&gt;This might be old stuff on this list, considering the groups formidable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;collective knowledge base.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But, then again, maybe not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I for one would like to use a 3D graphical browser to navigate my hard 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disks and the web.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not to mention being able to choose a specific type of visual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;representation that compliments my neurological structure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is this another gov/com, Mozilla/Netscape story in the making?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How long until we start seeing commercial 3D graphical browsers?
</EM><BR>

A really smart GUI would allow both automatic and deliberate grouping of 
<BR>
items - ie., represented by icons, etc., as in a focused area.  Thus, as the 
<BR>
purpose of grouping changed, the items made visible, highlighted, ghosted, 
<BR>
miniaturized or backgrounded - as having the background in shades indicating 
<BR>
affinity - or molded - as having structures representing nearby or far data 
<BR>
items or utilities would also shift and change.  3D textures would be 
<BR>
generated, mapping affinity clusters according to the currently relevant 
<BR>
dimensions of interest.
<BR>
One problem is the interface, obviously.  Although 3D mice, 3D glasses - 
<BR>
using alternate field LCD shutters, etc., have been around for a long time, 
<BR>
they never caught on at the consumer level, even though the expense was not 
<BR>
that great.  (The 3D shutter glasses were available on the Amiga in the late 
<BR>
'80's for about $150.)  Various incompatible standards did not help - much 
<BR>
like the various incompatible internet phone standards.
<BR>
The big problem, however, is the OS.  Even the mind-bogglingly awful 
<BR>
Pentium-based hardware is capable of cranking enough MFlops, given a 
<BR>
half-decent OS that doesn't piss it all away, but Windoze manages to eat up 
<BR>
every clock cycle you can possibly hand it and then still bog down if you 
<BR>
tell it to write something to a floppy at the same time it's running another 
<BR>
program like COREL or PageMaker.  The Amiga was also running 
<BR>
macro-programming and interprocess communication embedded in the OS back in 
<BR>
the 80's - very smoothly - but try that on a PC with Windoze.
<BR>
So the very idea of running a whole new layer in the GUI that would 
<BR>
continuously optimize and refine your visual environment to relate and 
<BR>
integrate data customized to you at the moment is way, way beyond the 
<BR>
MS-idiotware that the developers write for.
<BR>
Windoze has done more to slow down development of really neat advances in 
<BR>
I/O than even the government could have managed if it had tried to &quot;help.&quot;  
<BR>
I still have to re-link hundred of files from applications every week by 
<BR>
hand because the MS-idiotware doesn't have any layer of functionality that 
<BR>
allows for OS-supported aliasing or assigning - as the Amiga, once again, 
<BR>
introduced in 1989.
<BR>
Some day we will need a set of standards for credibility as it becomes an 
<BR>
objectively/digicash related medium of exchange.  It would be handy to have 
<BR>
some end-points for that scale, which leads me to the following question?  
<BR>
What garbage-for-brains MS guru decided that the only OS-supported file 
<BR>
links would be the top-down directory structure, I wonder.  I nominate him 
<BR>
or her for starters.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that BeOS, QNX, Linux or perhaps the new Amiga system coming from 
<BR>
Amino could do what you want, but then you might not find the software you 
<BR>
need to run is available.  There actually was quite a bit of discussion in 
<BR>
Amiga developer circles of this very issue recently.
