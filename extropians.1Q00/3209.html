<P>All,
<BR>
<P>May I share a fantasy with you all? I used to be a christian even a
<BR>
fundamentalist one. Well no one is perfect, sorry John ;). I became an atheist
<BR>
and at first I felt like Robert Ingersoll in his quote here:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When I became convinced that the Universe 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is natural, that all the ghosts and gods are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myths, there entered into my soul, into every 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with light and all the bolts, and bars, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manacles became dust.&quot;   -Robert Ingersoll 
<BR>
<P>Then slowly crept in a feeling of slight remorse. No I wasn't backsliding,
<BR>
reason and logic would not allow that. However, I'd see on the news some deeply
<BR>
heinous act of cruelty of one or several human beings against others and think
<BR>
&quot;Too bad there's not a hell!&quot;. Some people truly deserve more punishment than
<BR>
this life can ever offer.
<BR>
<P>I'd already figured out, even without knowing of the existence of Extropianism,
<BR>
that we would one day truly become as godlike as technologically possible and
<BR>
that we would create our own heaven. I reasoned out that we might even find a
<BR>
way to resurrect the dead from the past.
<BR>
<P>My first inclination was time travel. Having an eternity to do so we could go
<BR>
back to the recent past (in my newly learned vernacular &quot;pre-singularity&quot;--is
<BR>
this correct?) and snatch someone just milliseconds before death and whisk them
<BR>
to our glorious future. I hadn't worked out the finer details but it would
<BR>
entail not disturbing the timeline (provided time travel to our own timeline
<BR>
were possible rather than a parallel one). In their past those around them
<BR>
wouldn't be the wiser that they had disappeared. There was a sci-fi movie called
<BR>
&quot;Millennium&quot; somewhat along these lines but not for the same purpose.
<BR>
Information gathered from them would lead to the coordinates and histories of
<BR>
their relatives and friends and then from those the same and on marching
<BR>
backward in time extracting people from eternal death. How far back we might go
<BR>
in the human evolutionary continuum might be food for interesting discussion.
<BR>
<P>Lately I've considered that their uploadable information might be the thing to
<BR>
get. Kip Thorn doesn't believe time travel will be possible to any time prior to
<BR>
the building of the time machine, if at all. However, some Germans have been
<BR>
successful at sending information faster than the speed of light so to me the
<BR>
jury is still out. Going on this, if it's not possible to physically go back in
<BR>
time and therefore violate any paradox concerning too much matter from your
<BR>
matter being duplicated, then perhaps information can still be sent and
<BR>
received. I'll leave the details for those much more clever than I. The how of
<BR>
it all is not my core point.
<BR>
<P>My point is that maybe one day we could bring people to justice that in the past
<BR>
escaped it. I don't propose any eternal torment or even the medieval physical
<BR>
tortures, though some might. If you had the opportunity to resurrect Hitler or
<BR>
Stalin, how would you make them appreciate their crime? How much time would you
<BR>
give them to learn remorse? Consider that they wouldn't be allowed to just die
<BR>
and forget it all. All six million of Hitler's Jewish victims could parade his
<BR>
cell each day. He could be made to believe they were ghosts so that he wouldn't
<BR>
be able to rationalize that they now were alive so &quot;what's the harm?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>What psychological torments could you devise for John Wayne Gecy or Ted Bundy? 
<BR>
I thought maybe a thousand years of solitary confinement for each death one
<BR>
caused maliciously. Conversely those wrongly accused and jailed or executed
<BR>
could be exonerated and compensated. So what do you all think of my fantasy? I'm
<BR>
sure I'm not alone. I don't read a lot of sci-fi so I don't know if this idea's
<BR>
in some book somewhere. Well perhaps I've sparked some discussion.
<BR>
<P>James
