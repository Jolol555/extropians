<EM>&gt; I think we actually share the expectation that the device I

<EM>&gt; describe can be made very cheaply - just not now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, I see. Yes, that does make more sense.  Prices for all of the necessary
<BR>
hardware seem to be declining steadily, so I could see easily see a
<BR>
full-featured $200 computer with wireless Internet access in the 3-5 year
<BR>
time frame.  Making it work via satellite, or running it off of solar or
<BR>
hand power, would be a lot more challenging, but I don't think either of
<BR>
those capabilities is actually needed.  Electrification and cell phone
<BR>
systems are rapidly spreading to cover every part of the world where there
<BR>
is anyone who could actually use such a system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The idea behind distributing the devices instead of money would be for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people funding the project to get to exercise a little choice in selecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large-scale social policy goals, raising the horizon of philanthropy from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple food-distribution and emergency-response aid, to a longer-term goal
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; raising the cognitive level of the most disadvantaged one-third of
</EM><BR>
humanity.
<BR>
<P>A laudable goal, and I expect that social engineering by philanthropists
<BR>
would be better than social engineering by the local dictator.  However, I
<BR>
still think this is a flawed approach.  It falls afoul of the same problems
<BR>
of perverse incentives and information flow that prevent command economies
<BR>
from working.  As I said before, the fact that a net connection is immensely
<BR>
useful to us does not mean that it is the best thing an illiterate farmer in
<BR>
Zimbabwe could spend his $200 on.  The optimal investment is different for
<BR>
each individual, and no outside organization will be able to make the best
<BR>
choice (or even an especially good one) consistently.
<BR>
<P>IMHO, the best thing a philanthropist can possibly do to help the world's
<BR>
poor is to give them the capital to help themselves.  And, since handouts
<BR>
only encourage dependency, the best ways to do that is to invest in local
<BR>
businesses.  If you want to bring the internet to the Third World, the
<BR>
optimal method would be to establish a profitable business that sets up
<BR>
shared net connections of some kind.  If you want to be more flexible than
<BR>
that, get into the micro-loan business.
