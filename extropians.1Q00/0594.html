John Grigg continues,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;As J.R. pointed out, those who are not only talented but ambitious and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successful do deserve the fruits of their labors (a key reason why communism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;failed) I do think they should help the less fortunate.  How to best do this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is the question.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have two engines for producing kenetic energy, and one engine has twice
<BR>
the talent for this that the other has, which one deserves more good fuel? That
<BR>
might help to explain why the talented &quot;deserve more of the good things in the
<BR>
world.&quot; They deserve more, because they yield a higher ROI. They deserve more
<BR>
because they give more. (You can't tell if they have talent unless they produce
<BR>
something.) If Weinberg really couldn't figure that out for himself, what a
<BR>
silly trick he has played on his readers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&lt;&gt;--   --&lt;&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;&gt;--  --&lt;&gt;--
<BR>
<P>&quot;The whole gospel of Karl Marx can be summed up in a single sentence: Hate
<BR>
the man who is better off than you are. Never under any circumstances admit
<BR>
that his success may be due to his own efforts, to the productive
<BR>
contribution he has made to the whole community. Always attribute his
<BR>
success to the exploitation, the cheating, the more or less open robbery of
<BR>
others. Never under any circumstances admit that your own failure may be
<BR>
owing to your own weakness, or that the failure of anyone else may be due to
<BR>
his own defects -- his laziness, incompetence, improvidence, or
<BR>
stupidity.&quot; --Henry Hazlitt
