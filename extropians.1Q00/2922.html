<P>Anyone can create an XML document that annotates another
<BR>
document by using XML's linking language.  These documents
<BR>
can be contained anywhere so the real problem is finding
<BR>
them.  It's my opinion that the main interface to the Web
<BR>
will become the search engine.  Domain names have a number
<BR>
of problems - there's not enough to go around, they have a
<BR>
very restricted character set, big business disputes
<BR>
ownership, etc.  I think most people who've been using the
<BR>
Web for a long time use search engines and bookmarks more
<BR>
than they type URLs so it makes sense to put the search
<BR>
interface in the browser and tie it in with your bookmarks,
<BR>
history, etc.  Once you've got the search interface you can
<BR>
start splitting it up into specific chunks - an annotations
<BR>
search, a travel search, a commerce search. The browser will
<BR>
become a bunch of interfaces for different types of search -
<BR>
buy, sell, auction, annotate, etc.  (We're not limited to
<BR>
annotation either, XML's support for transclusion means that
<BR>
a suitably savvy browser will be able to pick and mix all
<BR>
sorts of data in any number of novel ways.)
