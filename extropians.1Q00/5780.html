<EM>&gt; &gt; I've come to the conclusion that ZDnet is nothing but the propaganda organ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of techno-fascists. Remember, they were the ones hyping the NC so much a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; few years ago, until I suggested that too many underpowered machines in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offices would likely increase the rate of postal episodes at work...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the economies of scale had not turned PCs into NCs, the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been good.  But you can't produce a low cost terminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the price of a PC when your volumes are so much lower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That and the fact that the execution of the idea was highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mismanaged and motivated primarily by the desire to pull the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rug out from under Microsoft made it a questionable business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; venture.  It was a high stakes game that became irrelevant when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the web took off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Larry made an interesting comment at the CATO conference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last year I think.  The gist of it was that you should leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the configuration, management, backup, etc. of machines of non-IT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in the hands of IT &quot;professionals&quot;.  It was a MIS mentality,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived from the NC efforts and when I heard it I didn't like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Larry Ellison? Yeah, I've come to the conclusion that as far as 
<BR>
the consumer market is concerned, whenever Larry speaks, do the 
<BR>
opposite of what he says, and you'll make money. There is a 
<BR>
reason why HE isn't in Bill Gates' shoes, and thats it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But given the amount of time I spend installing, upgrading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debugging, etc. software, there is merit to the argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've spent the better part of the last 2 weeks upgrading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Win2K, reinstalling software, testing it, etc.  Now its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great once you have it done, but for people who are from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside the industry it has got to be a nightmare.
</EM><BR>
<P>Haven't gone to 2k yet. I'm confused, thats the upgrade to 
<BR>
NT right? I'll probably do that in a few months when I get 
<BR>
a machine to put my NT IIS drive into. Right now I'm 
<BR>
wrestling with getting x-windows to run well on my Win98 box, 
<BR>
communicating with my linux box, which has no monitor...the 
<BR>
refresh is terrible, and proceses keep hanging on me.
