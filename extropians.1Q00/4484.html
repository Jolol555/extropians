valid argument. There is great stuff in the OpenSource

Ach, it would be a such a GHASTLY thing INDEED. Only 100% installed
<BR>
base Win2k would be so much WORSE.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'll admit to knowing basically nothing about Windows internals, but the
</EM><BR>
<P>Believe me, you're better off innocent of having descended into that
<BR>
particular tar pit. (I didn't, either, (I'm not crazy) but I heard war
<BR>
stories). Architecture?  Which architecture? Gee, and what a nice
<BR>
upgrade philosophy. Active X control overwriting DLLs when visiting a
<BR>
website without even prompting user for acknowledgement. Having to
<BR>
have your software sanctioned by Microsoft (for a fee, of course)
<BR>
orelse it wouldn't install on win2k. Office 2k, which _requires_
<BR>
online registration, even if legitimaly purchased, or it will cease
<BR>
function after a 20-30 starts. Excuse me? I must really admire the
<BR>
blind trust users still put into the big momma Microsoft. Gag me with
<BR>
a pitchfork (excuse my French).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; conventional wisdom is that the OS is pretty tightly coupled to the UI,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; otherwise why would doing anything on a Windows machine remotely be such
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a pain?  And even if technically Microsoft could slap completely new
</EM><BR>
<P>Try BackOrifice 2000. Free remote administration kit (and a hacker's
<BR>
best friend, but you don't need to tell that your boss, if
<BR>
any). Markedly, not a Microsoft product. 
<BR>
<P>Microsoft, the black hole of great minds. How can so many brilliant
<BR>
people produce so few, submediocre products? I suspect an evil alien
<BR>
conspiracy...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; interfaces onto Windows easily, they couldn't do anything non-incremental
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for business reasons.  The installed base is overwhelmingly important.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Same applies to Apple.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your Apple pie//doesn't taste too nice//you better wise up//Steven Jobs.
<BR>
Still, better him then that Sculley creep.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; 1) Is there anything decent you can use now (and if you have to compile it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; yourself, you've completely missed the point as far as the mass market is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; concerned).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Sure, you can use Gnome &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</A>&gt; or KDE
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</A>&gt; right now.  Most Linux distributions ship with one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; or the other as the default desktop, and easy to install binary packages
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are available.  To the extent that I care, they already look and feel
</EM><BR>
<P>Particularly Debian (with it's 2k odd packages) is beautifully easy to 
<BR>
upgrade.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Well, Gnome and KDE have only been around for a few years and are already
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; quite slick.  I will predict that more UI innovation will come from
</EM><BR>
<P>Full agreement here. In fact properly configured Gnome/Enlightenment
<BR>
is fucking spectacular. The changeable skin approach is entering the
<BR>
desktop with a vengeance. Of course nobody likes flash desktops, no
<BR>
more than people still stick to ~0.6 MBytes RAM in their machines.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the open source camp than Microsoft or Apple in the future.  Unix is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; platform anyone can innovate on, Windows and MacOS are platforms only
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; their corporate owners can innovate on.  However, I'd guess that any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; real UI innovation won't originate on the traditional desktop (perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; video games or mobiles).
</EM><BR>
<P>Almost 1 Mio of Playstations2's have been already sold in Japan, just
<BR>
after introduction. Despite hardware troubles, memory card shortages
<BR>
and recalls. Wowie.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Hand-code what?  Use CORBA.  From my limited vantage point, forget about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; COM and CORBA, Windows and Unix.  Write everything in Java (now there's
</EM><BR>
<P>Java would be so very cool indeed, if it didn't crash my browser after
<BR>
a while, with nigh 100% high reliability. Speaking of browsers, that
<BR>
Netscape piece of offal with it's insidous memory leaks is probably
<BR>
the most buggy piece of software, er, software I'm still using right
<BR>
now. While you don't have to reboot periodically to keep your machine
<BR>
minty-fresh (as with Certain OSses We All Know And Love Well But Won't
<BR>
Mention), having to restart the browser (or losing lots of ephemeral
<BR>
state due to a crash) sucks bigtime. Mozilla, you're really overdue.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; a real cost savings vs. C++), abstract your transport, and you can easily
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; plug into COM, CORBA, some fancy message queue, or whatever, easily.
