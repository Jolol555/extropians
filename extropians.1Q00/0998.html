BLEEP BLEEP WARNING: SLIGHT A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY SPOILERS AHEAD BLEEP 
<BR>
BLEEP DANGER WARNING. DO NOT READ I REPEAT DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU
<BR>
INTEND TO READ THE BOOK SOMETIME SOON.
<BR>
<P>Ok, I gave fair warning. It's all your own fault now.

<P>What's you angle on OnOff btw? Is it a galactic halo or deep core
<BR>
artefact? And is the magic machine really broken? When do you think
<BR>
the Powers have gotten their first good look on Pham Nuwen for AFUTD
<BR>
reconstruction, during the OnOff episode, or during his later
<BR>
campaigns?
<BR>
<P>The Diamonds are the most obvious possible Transcend/core artefacts.
<BR>
<P>Btw, the law-tweaking cavorite from diamondoid nanocomputer (the
<BR>
Emergents nor the Queng Ho really did take a look at the molecular
<BR>
structure? And what was it powered with?) was imo the weakest part in
<BR>
the thing. It is consistent with the high/low polarity in that
<BR>
particular universe, however.
<BR>
<P>I'm hazy on AFUTD details, did the Power claim the body of Pham was
<BR>
discovered after his expedition gracing the Mindless Depths, or was
<BR>
this just a cover story?
