<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why?  I don't want to spend time near so much gravity.:)  I would prefer a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; free floating existence -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds like fun. Bound to get boring after a while. Probably have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dilitarious effects on ones bones and heart and a host of other things, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't take my word for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bodies need some redesign for zero-g living, but likely it is not that
<BR>
severe (do we really want calcified bones except for maybe the skull?
<BR>
Why not go for cartilage?). In fact, there might be more trouble with
<BR>
adapting to a low-g planet like Mars where you cannot escape the
<BR>
gravity or set up rotating simulated gravity environments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; - or one inside a hollowed out asteroid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let's do that too. In fact let's do that first! I've always contended that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to finance both Moon and Mars colonization with asteroid mining first.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is of course that it is doubtful there is anything
<BR>
valuable enough in the asteroids to cover the expenses given that we
<BR>
are moving towards an information/bio/nano society. Services might be
<BR>
a greater source of capital than matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It's kind of cute how a lot of people want to move into space only to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recreate Earth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, Earth is THE environment we are, so far, adapted to. One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason might be we are running--scratch that--HAVE run out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space. Unfortunately the archain ideologies that support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overpopulation don't appear to be abating any time soon.  We might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have an overpopulation &quot;singularity&quot; soon if we're not careful.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not supported by data. The current UN population estimates
<BR>
show that the population is likely to level out at 10-11 billion by
<BR>
2050 or so. A lot of people, but there is a huge amount of unused
<BR>
space and resources on Earth that can be used with the right
<BR>
technology and economic incentives. 
<BR>
<P>While I strongly support space colonisation both to ensure human
<BR>
survival in a likely turbulent future and promote human exploration
<BR>
and diversity, it is currently not very economic. It needs to be that
<BR>
before we will see any large scale colonies.
