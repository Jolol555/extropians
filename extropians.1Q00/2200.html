<P>
I have sent the following to the LA Times in response to Rifkin's piece.  I 
<BR>
would sincerely appreciate any Angelinos who may read that paper on a regular 
<BR>
basis letting me know if they publish it:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---
<BR>
<P>I would sincerely appreciate your publication of the following in response to 
<BR>
Jeremy Rifkin's piece in the February 3 L.A. Times.  I have included two 
<BR>
verisions.  The first is 513 words long, which exceeds the length called for 
<BR>
by the guidelines on your website.  The second has been edited to a bare 
<BR>
minimum of 311 words.  I believe the subject is important enough to warrant 
<BR>
the longer version and ask that you publish it. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;
<BR>
<P>In his editorial in the February 3 L.A. Times Science Section (&quot;Cloning: What 
<BR>
Hath Genomics Wrought&quot;), Jeremy Rifkin employs his usual smooth rhetorical 
<BR>
manipulation to enlist his reader's most primal instincts and fears in his 
<BR>
on-going campaign against the progressive use of technology.  Long ago, in 
<BR>
his poorly thought-out book &quot;Entropy: A New World View&quot;, Rifkin clearly 
<BR>
defined his goal of undermining our civilization's most basic values, setting 
<BR>
himself up as the ideological leader of a fundamentally reactionary retreat 
<BR>
to the imagined virtues of a pre-industrial world.  He has now stepped up his 
<BR>
program of opposition to the technologies that promise cures to diseases that 
<BR>
have plagued humanity throughout all of its history.
<BR>
<P>Pointing to the usual villains (&quot;evil transnational corporations&quot;), Rifkin 
<BR>
calls on the ultimate trump card, &quot;God, the creator&quot;, as the foundation for 
<BR>
his anti-progress fear-mongering.  What Rifkin and his followers on the 
<BR>
extreme left wing of the environmental movement (and their strange bedfellows 
<BR>
on the religious right) don't like to talk about is the fact that we are on 
<BR>
the verge of a wonderful new era of medicine, made possible by the genetic 
<BR>
technology they now explicitly paint as demonic.  And what they also fail to 
<BR>
disclose is that their opposition to genetic technology is deeply 
<BR>
inconsistent with the rights of individuals to choose their own destinies.  
<BR>
Lining up with the Almighty, Rifkin wraps himself up in the &quot;mom and apple 
<BR>
pie&quot; virtues of the parent-child relationship, as he lays the foundation for 
<BR>
yet new intrusions into people's rights to control their own lives.  In fact, 
<BR>
his campaign against genetic science is just another step down the road to 
<BR>
rule by the &quot;virtuecrats&quot; who would dictate the right and wrong of every 
<BR>
minute aspect of our lives, right down to the level of our molecular biology 
<BR>
and most intimate genetic identity.
<BR>
<P>Far from the coming age of human genetic medicine being one of &quot;the people 
<BR>
versus nasty corporations&quot;, it will actually be a race between reason and 
<BR>
fear.  And we should be clear that there is a whole industry built around 
<BR>
feeding and manipulating fear.  But as he builds a career on fear, what can 
<BR>
Rifkin tell the children who suffer from diseases that can be cured by the 
<BR>
medical techniques being developed with the powerful new tools of genetic 
<BR>
science?  That they must suffer and die because a cure would be &quot;un-natural&quot;? 
<BR>
&nbsp;That their afflictions are &quot;the will of God&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, most scientists are not Rifkin's equal as polemicists.  They 
<BR>
have not made a career of playing on people's fears to sell books and create 
<BR>
a Washington &quot;public interest&quot; power base.  Rifkin and the other purveyors of 
<BR>
panic have stolen a march in the public discourse on genetic science, because 
<BR>
the people who have actually been working to improve the human condition in 
<BR>
hundreds of laboratories around the world have made the assumption that 
<BR>
people should have the right to choose their own destinies.  It's time that 
<BR>
we look more closely at those who would cite homespun virtues in the name of 
<BR>
controlling our lives &quot;for our own good.&quot;
