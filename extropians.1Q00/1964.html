<EM>&gt; The ultimate problem with solar power is that there isn't enough of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've seen projections in which the planet's power needs by 2050 will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such that a band of 100% efficient solar cells 10 miles wide and wrapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole equator will not give enough power. So, even if we converted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all highways and all roofing materials to 98% efficient solar cells,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we're *still* going to have to go out and find other fuel sources.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, my comment would be -- *never* believe everything you read.
<BR>
As I said at Extro3 -- &quot;Trust but verify&quot;...
<BR>
<P>Draging up an Excel sheet (I just love Excel...),
<BR>
&nbsp;Earth's Circumference: 6378 km x 10 mi, gives about 2*10^9 km^2
<BR>
&nbsp;Assume perhaps 30% of it is getting sunlight at a rate of about
<BR>
&nbsp;750 w/m^2 that is being harvested at an efficiency of about 20%
<BR>
&nbsp;(after all if we are enginering for planetary power we can afford
<BR>
&nbsp;the &quot;good&quot; solar cells...).  That gives you ~10^10 W (J/sec).
<BR>
&nbsp;Assuming maybe 8 hours of light per day gives you an annual
<BR>
&nbsp;production of ~1000 EJ.
<BR>
<P>According to &quot;Energy: A Guidebook&quot;, in 1974, our annual energy
<BR>
consumption was 370 EJ (year round constant drain of 12 TW).
<BR>
So even with some pretty pessimistic assumptions we should be
<BR>
able to harvest 2-3x the amount of energy we are currently consuming.
<BR>
<P>So, I think there are some interesting built-in assumptions
<BR>
in your claim, like:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) You can't put power collectors in the ocean...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet here in Washington State we have several &quot;floating&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bridges...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That power consumption will continue to grow at past
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;historic rates...  But in the developed countries per
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capita power consumption seems to have leveled off...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) That there will be no improvements in energy efficiencies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(automobiles, electric lights, etc.)  [LEDs for example
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are 50%+ efficient, new electrodeless sodium vapor lamps
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are 2-3x as efficient as incandescent.]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The solar cells are the really crappy 8% efficient versions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than the 30+% efficient versions that we can build...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) That we don't use other more efficient technologies such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as heliostats and heat pumps to harvest the solar power...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
But we are talking 50 years here.  Everyone always assumes the same
<BR>
thing when discussing these limits -- the population grows, energy
<BR>
consumption grows and technology stands still.  Makes me want to gag.
<BR>
<P>And 10 miles wide is nothing, we've got agriculture production over
<BR>
much of the land area of the Northern hemisphere hundreds to thousands
<BR>
of miles wide!  I've previously discussed how terribly poor our
<BR>
agricultural efficiencies are.  If we can convert sunlight into
<BR>
carbohydrate at a *real* 1% efficiency, we'll so much agricultural
<BR>
land available that we probably have 1-2 orders of magnitude more
<BR>
power generation potential than the population would require.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Note that I'm assuming we don't get around to huge solar collectors in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space. THAT way we could get enough power for the planet.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  Though the power delivery area requirements remain a concern.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't count on the oil running dry anytime soon. If you read &quot;The State
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Humanity&quot; (which I can't seem to find on my bookshelf, so I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell you the authors' name...) you'll see that there are estimates that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have over 200 years worth of oil, even taking into account our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projected growth of energy use, and that by THAT time we should have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more reserves available than we do now, due to increases in extraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree if we limit our oil use to &quot;energy&quot; supply uses.
<BR>
The Jan/Feb 2000 issue of &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; has a interesting article:
<BR>
&quot;The Shocks of a World of Cheap Oil&quot; by Amy Myers Jaffe and Robert
<BR>
A. Manning.  They make some interesting counter-arguments to the doom
<BR>
and gloom scenarios painted by the Club of Rome and people like
<BR>
geologist Colin Campbell.
<BR>
<P>However, if we get to the point of building interesting diamondoid
<BR>
things out of oil, I can see the carbon supplies going rapidly.
<BR>
But by then it will be a very different economy, so it really
<BR>
won't matter.
<BR>
