<P>
<EM>&gt; If you think that you have an equal 'right of access' to that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memespace, then you are no better than a socialist who is against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is one thing to hold the opinion that infinitely copiable memespace 
<BR>
should be fenced off and privately held the same way as uncopyable
<BR>
dirtspace, but it is quite another to continue claiming that those who
<BR>
oppose the former also oppose the latter when you know that's not true.
<BR>
Either you can't see the obvious fundamental objective difference, or
<BR>
you are spreading a malicious lie; in either case, further rational
<BR>
argument with you on the issue is impossible until you admit that this
<BR>
statement is false, and that &quot;property&quot; and &quot;intellectual property&quot;
<BR>
are two completely separate things, unfortunate linguistic and legal
<BR>
similarities notwithstanding.
