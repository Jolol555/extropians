<P>but apparently it needs saying some more: despotism and  totalitarianism 
<BR>
thrive on secrecy.  Ubiquitous two-way power proportional transparency does 
<BR>
*away* with secrecy and, at the same time, with despotism.

<P>This particular debate is reflected in another topic of recent discussion - 
<BR>
The First Immortal and The Truth Machine by Halperin.  I met Conrad 
<BR>
Schneiker in about 1979 at monthly parties held at a local libertarian 
<BR>
business.  Schneiker is briefly credited in Drexler's Engines of Creation, 
<BR>
but, according to Conrad (co-inventor, BTW, of the scanning/tunneling array 
<BR>
chip), he is actually responsible for Engines being published at all.
<BR>
<P>Conrad says that Drexler intended to keep the wraps on the whole idea of 
<BR>
nanotech, with the idea that only an elite of govcorp philosopher king 
<BR>
technocrats would have the wisdom to properly develop it.  Note that Drexler 
<BR>
himself pushes this sort of take on the subject of AI, in Engines, 
<BR>
completely contradicting his own logic as to why the genie could not be kept 
<BR>
in the bottle for nanotech itself.  This, according to Conrad, was Drexler's 
<BR>
actual position re nanotech, however, and it was only his - Conrad's - 
<BR>
threat to publish independently that forced Drexler's hand.
<BR>
<P>Conrad's position of note, however, when I met him, was on the current 
<BR>
topic.  He pointed out around '79 that the only survivable high-tech 
<BR>
civilization would be one with universal surveillance.  Consider that the 
<BR>
price for total species annihilation has been and will continue to decline 
<BR>
exponentially for the forseeable future.  No centralized Big Brother can 
<BR>
handle this problem in the long term, as - to put it very briefly - &quot;who 
<BR>
guards the guards.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Only a competitive system, probably run by the insurance companies looking 
<BR>
for risk violations, could possibly have a reasonable chance for longterm - 
<BR>
i.e., staying ahead of the risk curve for the life of the universe - success 
<BR>
in preventing species destruction.  That, as I understood it, was Conrad's 
<BR>
position in a nutshell.
<BR>
<P>Now note that even though Conrad and his take are never mentioned explicitly 
<BR>
in The Truth Machine, you find these anomalous passages that are nothing 
<BR>
short of a direct attack on that position, even though they really add 
<BR>
nothing to the novel, and never address Conrad's central arguments.  I.e., 
<BR>
Halperin is part of - in my considered opinion - the Drexlerian/MIT 
<BR>
technocracy conspiracy to sell a policy and then move in as the logical 
<BR>
implementors, sometime perhaps ten or twenty years hence.
