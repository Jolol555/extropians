<P>
Wired has an article this morning about a supposed scientific theory
<BR>
explaining why and how homeopathic medicines could work.  I have done
<BR>
some web research though and found an even more interesting story behind
<BR>
the story.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,33749,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,33749,00.html</A>
<BR>
<P>In homeopathy, materials are diluted repeatedly, to an astronomical
<BR>
degree.  One drop of solution is mixed with 99 drops of pure water and
<BR>
shaken to form a more dilute solution.  This may be repeated dozens of
<BR>
times, until statistically there is no chance that even a single molecule
<BR>
of the original remains (unless it stuck to the glass, I suppose).
<BR>
Homeopaths say that the MORE diluted it gets, the STRONGER it gets,
<BR>
exactly the opposite of conventional medical reasoning.
<BR>
<P>Wired writes, quoting a homeopath's book:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Validation of the dilution process came in a roundabout way, thanks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to research by California Institute of Technology chemistry professor
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shui Yin Lo, who was performing experiments on how to improve car
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engine efficiency.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo found that water molecules, which are random in their normal state,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin to form a cluster when a substance is added to water and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water is vigorously shaken -- the exact process homeopaths use to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create their medicine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo said every substance exerts its own unique influence on the water,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so each cluster shape and configuration is unique to the substance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;added. With each dilution and shaking, the clusters grow bigger and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stronger. This water, which homeopaths call &quot;potentized,&quot; is considered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;structured water,&quot; because the water molecules have taken on a shape
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;influenced by the original substance.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clusters start to assume a form that mimics the structure of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;original substance itself. So even though the chemical can no longer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be detected, its &quot;image&quot; is there, taken on by the water molecules.
<BR>
<P>This would be remarkable if true.  Now for the really interesting
<BR>
part.  I found a web page devoted to debunking these claims,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/ATG/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/ATG/</A>.  It seems that Dr. Lo, presently a
<BR>
visiting professor at Caltech, is Director of R&amp;D at a company called ATG
<BR>
which is exploiting his technology with some very questionable products,
<BR>
including an additive for your air filter that will improve your car's
<BR>
performance, and the &quot;Laundry Ball&quot; which will clean your clothes without
<BR>
detergent (both of these products have been forced off the market as
<BR>
fraudulent in some states).
<BR>
<P>Lo's research has been described as involving the discovery of &quot;room
<BR>
temperature ice&quot; (shades of Kurt Vonnegut!).  A press release from ATG
<BR>
from the site above reads:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unique Non-Melting Ice Crystal Found in Room Temperature Water:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant Implications for Medicine, Manufacturing, and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New research by a group of California scientists at the American
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technologies Group have discovered, identified, and characterized a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unique type of stable (non-melting) ice crystals that maintain an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electrical field. These scientists and several leading university
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professors are finding significant applications of these unique ice
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crystals in medicine and pharmacy, in combustion enhancement, and in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surfactants and cleansing agents.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, they have been found to increase significantly the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to infection and cancer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been found to improve gas combustion and reduce pollution
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emissions. They have also been found to improve significantly the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficacy of large industrial furnaces used to make ingredients for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the manufacture of plastics.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shui-Yin Lo, PhD, a visiting professor at the California Institute
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Technology and an internationally respected theoretical physicist,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has led a team of scientists to confirm the existence and significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the ice crystals and their electrical fields.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of these ice crystals has been verified with photographs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from an electron microscope, providing two-dimension al pictures of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ice crystals, and the newly developed Atomic force microscope
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which provides three-dimensional photographs of the crystals. Dr. Lo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls these ice crystals, IE crystals (&quot;I&quot; stands for ice, and &quot;E&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the electrical field that is emanated from them). The IE crystals
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look a bit like a lentil bean and have a flat disc configuration. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crystals congregate into clusters that range from 15nm to several
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;microns in size and can even be seen with a light micrscope using
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high power magnification.
<BR>
<P>Read the site for more surprises: the Scientology connection, a possible
<BR>
stock scam, board members who were involved with another scam company,
<BR>
and other miraculous technologies coming soon from ATG (including the
<BR>
health products hinted at above).
<BR>
<P>Oh, it also turns out that Lo got into the dilution research with the
<BR>
specific intention of copying homeopathic procedures.  He didn't just
<BR>
stumble into it as the Wired article implies.
