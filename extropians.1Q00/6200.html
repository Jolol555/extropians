Orange County, California Extropians/Transhumanists Meeting?
<BR>
<P>Why not.....
<BR>
<P>First, a shameless plug:
<BR>
<P>I suggest Natale Cybercafe at Harbor and Adams, NE corner, Costa Mesa, about 
<BR>
2 miles South of the 405 (olcity.com/natale).  This particular Natale boasts 
<BR>
four Wintel machines with a high-speed DSL connection, XLNT coffee and real 
<BR>
quality food at very reasonable prices.
<BR>
<P>The staff of mostly college students and the atmosphere are equally 
<BR>
high-quality (impressionist paintings, jazz, classical or refined &quot;rock&quot; in 
<BR>
the background, or quiet classical guitar live by one of the staff, or bring 
<BR>
your own CD) as is the typical clientel of software developers and techies.  
<BR>
No tie required, but intelligent conversation is mandatory.  (I recommend 
<BR>
it, regardless.)  The attitude is very tolerant.  One elderly patron 
<BR>
occasionally falls asleep in a comfy armchair and everyone just works around 
<BR>
her until either she wakes up or they lock the door.
<BR>
<P>For $20, you can buy 10 hours on-line, and you get 15 minutes free with 
<BR>
coffee.  The hours are outstanding, as the posted hours really only indicate 
<BR>
when the staff start cleaning up and giving away the unsold food.  Altho 
<BR>
technically closed at 10pm - Sundays 9 - I have been hacking away many a 
<BR>
night at midnight (10:56pm right now).  The owner of this franchise location 
<BR>
is a local startup Wintel software/hardware company, and one or more of 
<BR>
their reps usually show up to lock up and will be happy to talk hardware 
<BR>
sales or setup, if you are so inclined.
<BR>
<P>There appear to be enough chairs for at least 18 people, plus the carpet in 
<BR>
the main conversation section, and the space is conveniently divided so that 
<BR>
several possible conversation centers are feasible.  The noise level and 
<BR>
acoustics  are quite good for meeting purposes.
<BR>
<P>So, if you're local and think that a physical meeting might be worthwhile, 
<BR>
let me know and we'll figure out a date.  Or, if you have alternate 
<BR>
preferences for location, I am reasonably flexible, altho I think that 
<BR>
Natale will be hard to beat.
<BR>
<P>(I only have a conflict on Thursday nights, and 2nd Sunday mornings, when 
<BR>
Atheist United breakfasts, or 3rd Sunday afternoons, the local Amiga club.)
<BR>
<P>I don't have an agenda planned, but I'm sure we'll find something to 
<BR>
disguss, such as future topics, books, etc.  Meanwhile, check out Natale, a 
<BR>
hub of OC culture.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********************************************************
<BR>
<P>BTW, at the other Natale, 17th and Main, Santa Ana, just South of the 5, on 
<BR>
alternate Wednesdays - there is the Socrates Cafe, hosted by a philosphy 
<BR>
professor from Chapman, Martin Young (madwizard.com/cafe), and recently 
<BR>
written up in the OC Register.  Martin is very much an extropian, altho I 
<BR>
doubt he calls himself such, with an excellent background in physics and 
<BR>
other hard sciences, and is also a science fiction fan.  The meetings are 
<BR>
pretty much open-ended directed discussions of applied philosophy.
<BR>
<P>There's no attempt - except by individual fanatics, of course - to deliver 
<BR>
doctrinaire sermons, but principles of rational discourse are enforced.  
<BR>
Claims of general invalidation - i.e., any claim that requires that 
<BR>
knowledge itself be impossible - are generally gleefully shot down in very 
<BR>
short order, especially as usually about half of the attendees have 
<BR>
objectivist backgrounds.
<BR>
<P>The typical attendees have ranged all over the map, including some Mexican 
<BR>
blue-collar types who had no real idea what philosophy was, but they wanted 
<BR>
to find out, and made some interesting contributions to the discussion.  A 
<BR>
good time is to be expected.  Be there.
