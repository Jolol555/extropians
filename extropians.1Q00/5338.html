<EM>&gt; &gt; It is totally illicit for non-religious rationalists to attempt to adopt a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  stance superior to theists by depriving them of rationality.

<EM>&gt; I'm not stating that its superior, or that I am not a theist. But there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need for rational scientific solutions to the practical problem of death.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, because you used the word &quot;scientific&quot;; you see, I consider &quot;logic&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;mathematics&quot; as subsets of &quot;Rationality&quot; -- I suppose I have been
<BR>
greatly influenced by Dr. Carl Jung who convinced me that what he called
<BR>
&quot;The Feeling Function&quot; was as &quot;rational&quot; as &quot;The Thinking Function&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Additionally, there have been people dead for quite a while, who might need a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit of a push. That is, unless you wish to consider them dead forever, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most living people do.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is fascinating.   You must understand that the technologies I deal with
<BR>
every day do not include cryogenics and nanotech.  When I participate in
<BR>
this list, I am not inclined to shop-talk, which means I take a philosophical
<BR>
approach.  I'm afraid I'm painfully ignorant regarding precisely those techno-
<BR>
logies that are of greatest interest to Extropians. So would you be willing
<BR>
to talk about this some more?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This might not be your area of focus or interest, quite understandable. Yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jerks like me continue to look. Oh well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I recall the inscription on the stone arch over the commons entrance at
<BR>
my undergraduate university:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The University concerns the Universe, within
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose Infinity have arisen Life, Order and Man&quot;
