<EM>&gt; Hmmm.  So my &quot;shield&quot; would actually be a head-to-toe distributed network

of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nanobots coursing through every square millimeter of my body on the

lookout
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for attackers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And when I'm attacked, billions of nanobots fight to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death in such fragile places as my neo-cortex?  I admit that I may not
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a firm grasp on the magnitude of these things, but I don't think that
</EM><BR>
having
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my body serve as a huge battlefield for trillions of nano-soldiers calms
</EM><BR>
my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fears much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is the big problem with personal defenses.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Defending inert matter, or even appropriately designed macro-scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;machinery, isn't a big deal.  The hard problem is defending delicate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hard-to-upgrade territory like a human body.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And isn't that *the* problem?  I'm not really concerned with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting my car from a nanobot attack.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it is and it isn't.  Look at some of the possible outcomes:
<BR>
<P>1) If you couldn't defend any kind of hardware against a nanobot attack,
<BR>
there would be no prospect of anyone ever surviving the invention of
<BR>
nanotech (with the possible exception of complete borganisms).
<BR>
<P>2) If defending hardware is practical, but defending people is impossible,
<BR>
then no one can survive exposure to even a tiny dose of hostile nanobots.
<BR>
However, you might have survivors in isolated bunkers if they have enough
<BR>
layers of nanobot protection.
<BR>
<P>3) If defending people is very difficult, but not impossible, then you can
<BR>
survive being exposed to a miniscule dose of nanobots.  That means people
<BR>
you can survive using pressure suits, airtight habitats, and moderately
<BR>
paranoid decontamination procedures.
<BR>
<P>4) If defending people is easy, anyone with money can buy a system that will
<BR>
let them ignore the whole problem (as long as they don't fall into a vat of
<BR>
gray goo, or something equally stupid).  That means most modern countries
<BR>
survive the invention of nanotech, but the third world and Earth's natural
<BR>
biosphere could easily be destroyed.
<BR>
<P>5) If defending people is trivial, we immunize the whole world easily.
<BR>
<P>Now, my personal bet is on option 3.  Area defenses inside a sealed habitat
<BR>
should be capable of preventing significant nanobot infiltrations, and a
<BR>
well-designed immune system should be able to kill off very small numbers of
<BR>
intruders before they do any significant damage.  Options 2 and 4 are
<BR>
possible, but seem less likely at the moment.  Options 1 and 5 both seem a
<BR>
bit unrealistic.
<BR>
<P>Oh, and lets not forget, this discussion only applies to the early stages of
<BR>
development.  Once you get really advanced nanotech you can redesign the
<BR>
human body, and the distinction between hardware and biological material
<BR>
ceases to mean anything.
