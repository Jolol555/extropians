<P><EM>&gt; Heh heh heh- yeah, the problem with international law is, how do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enforce it?  The key word is &quot;force&quot;.  &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>In a sense, all law has to be backed up by force in one way or another.  The 
<BR>
question, though, is whether all of the force has to be concentrated in a 
<BR>
single institution or, as the West has come to realize, it is better to 
<BR>
disperse the rightful use of force among various different groups and power 
<BR>
centers.  In this respect, the international regime is the ultimate 
<BR>
&quot;polycentric legal system&quot; and, in fact, there has been a developing trend 
<BR>
toward an enforceable international law.  It's not universal and it's not 
<BR>
&quot;unicentric&quot; (fortunately), but I think there definitely HAS been progress in 
<BR>
international law in the last 200 years or so, and especially in the last 50 
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Cooperative agreements are for people who can cooperate, and sovereign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  governments have a poor track record for that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the current period is one in which the international regime is more 
<BR>
peaceful and &quot;legal&quot; than at any previous time I can think of.  Consider how 
<BR>
RARE cross-border military actions are now, compared to all previous periods 
<BR>
of human history.  Europe has been at peace for 55 years - an incredible 
<BR>
record for that fractious bunch, in light of their past history.  This has 
<BR>
been due in large part to the development of norms of conduct at many 
<BR>
different, interlocking levels, from multi-lateral regional agreements, 
<BR>
through inter-regional and bilateral arrangements, down to what may be most 
<BR>
important, a broadly-accepted, unwritten notion of civil conduct that has 
<BR>
served to deter the kind of nationalistic militarism that was the hallmark of 
<BR>
Western history for millennia before.
