<EM>&gt; But, I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine a better way, though as Eliezer invariably reminds us (and rightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so), there _is_ a better way.  Our obsession with finding and retaining a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sterile jury is a noble intent, but impossible in reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, in &quot;current&quot; reality it seems difficult, but in future reality
<BR>
an &quot;eJury&quot; would do the trick.  Just copy &quot;uploaded&quot; minds selected
<BR>
for Jury duty.  Have the trial.  When situations arise where things
<BR>
need to be &quot;ignored&quot;, you just do a &quot;rollback&quot; (database terminology) to
<BR>
the time prior to the occurence of those things that need to be ignored.
<BR>
As was observed by Baily in &quot;After Thought&quot; the problem is that
<BR>
normal humans don't have a delete key.  We can fix that.
<BR>
<P>Now, of course one gets into the question of what would make an
<BR>
&quot;ideal&quot; eJury.  Since you could have the selection of any ePerson
<BR>
that ever existed, what would be an &quot;ideal&quot; jury?
<BR>
<P>Would you want a jury of people who are highly trained legally
<BR>
(say GBurchN/former supreme court justices?) or a jury of people
<BR>
with more experience with the everyday reality, albeit, those
<BR>
demonstrating a high capacity for rational thought (say EvMick clones),
<BR>
or would you want people highly trained in scientific analysis or
<BR>
the intricacies of rational thought (say some Nobel prize winners
<BR>
or Robert Owen types)?
<BR>
<P>I've always thought one of the interesting *nits* in the legal
<BR>
system is the concept of Judgement by one's &quot;peers&quot;.  Does that
<BR>
mean that I get a jury of Extropians?  Or do I get a jury where
<BR>
most of the people watch Days of our Lives, Jerry Springer
<BR>
and WWF all day?
<BR>
<P>Things that make you go hmmmmmm....
