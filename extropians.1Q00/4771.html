<EM>&gt;From: Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20near%20anything%20boxes%20allowed%20to%20br%20in%20the%20hands%20of%20the%20public?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000313233518.89419.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">lee@piclab.com</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neither pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; called the NRA and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; paranoid maniacs,&quot; *that* would be pejorative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Your so-called statement of fact is a statement about the desired goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of an organization.  Since it is contrary to the publicly stated goals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of that organization, and contrary to the personal goals of everyone I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have ever met who belongs to that organization it is not only pejorative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but clearly a delibrate lie to discredit an opponent you know little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about rather than having to do the hard work of arguing actual facts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it not true that the NRA opposes virtually *every* single piece of 
<BR>
gun-control legislation that comes down the pike?  Is it not true that the 
<BR>
NRA opposes any attempt reduce the production of new guns?  Is it not true 
<BR>
that the NRA is opposed to reducing the number of guns now in circulation?  
<BR>
Is it not true that there are more guns in America than there are Americans? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not true that the NRA sees no problem with the ratio of guns to 
<BR>
people?  Please stop me when I've said something that is not true.
<BR>
