<EM>&gt; &gt; Howzabout THIS for not only pejorative, but irretrievably true?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; namely?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Blocking ALL gun-related legislation, however reasonable.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as distinguished from their

<EM>&gt; &gt; Madison Avenue bullshit spindoctor-manufactured Hollywood (Prez
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Charleton Heston?  Yagottabekidding!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?  You reckon Heston doesn't really know how to shoot, or something?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
He and his good buddy Wayne certainly know how to cram their 
<BR>
feet so deeply in their mouths that they cut their throats on their 
<BR>
hangnails.  Even Dubya Bush is distancing himself from their most 
<BR>
recent fits of heartless paranoid logorrheic slander.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; image, would lead one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; necessarily believe that the voting majority of their members are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; soulless ghouls who have perpetual hard-ons for and wear their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emotionally overwrought and bleeding hearts on their sleeves for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lifeless and engineered-for-the-express-purpose-of-death-dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hunks of metal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To pick a nit - the *purpose* of most guns is not to kill but to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threaten, as in &quot;Let go of that nice lady before I do something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permanent.&quot;  The threat, to be effective, requires the *ability* to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death; but the ability and the purpose are not the same thing.  &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most effective weapon is the one that need never be used.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
It depends upon who buys the gun; that's NOT why muggers buy 
<BR>
them.  I wanna keep guns out of the hands of people who would 
<BR>
threaten myself or my family; the NRA doesn't, because the fear 
<BR>
engendered by having such vicious criminals and crazies armed 
<BR>
persuades people to buy guns and join the NRA.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but cannot muster a shred of sympathy for dead little girls. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For every dead little girl who makes headlines, there's another (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another and another) who is alive because a gun was available.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would condemn them, and feel good about it because they were bludgeoned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or strangled rather than shot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&quot;If only she'd had a gun of her own...&quot;  The cartoon I referred to now 
<BR>
spouts from your mouth.  Murdered little girls are typically 
<BR>
kidnapped by perverts and killed in private, where no guns can save 
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Forgive me if I don't see what's so damned superior about you because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't appreciate the value of a reliable defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I not only appreciate its value (I own two handguns, two rifles and a 
<BR>
shotgun), I recognize its limitations.  It will not protect you or your 
<BR>
family against a treacherous backshooting criminal or a random 
<BR>
sudden crazy, which is why I want weapons kept out of their hands.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; They DO sociopathically, and quite obviously, care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more for killing machines than they do for their fellow human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beings, although to call the rest of the race their &quot;fellows&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slurs the rest of humanity by association with pond scum. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I'm reminded of Huxley's retort to Wilberforce.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Wilberforce this.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; impolite to call sick, twisted, demented and bloodthirsty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (&quot;PLEASE, Lord, lemme meet a mugger today and legally kill 'im!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; psychopaths what they are, but the truth, by definition, can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; NEVER be an insult!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I bought my first gun four years ago, my then housemate (a life NRA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; member who taught me to shoot) said, &quot;Congratulations. May you never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He goes to the range every Sunday; he is quite fond of his Dirty Harry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piece, and has had more than one occasion to show it to a mugger.  (His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; former place of business, a bookshop, was in a seedy neighborhood.) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They fled at the sight, so he didn't need to fire it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Across this great land, similar encounters happen about a million times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a year, by every credible estimate.  (Low end about 0.6 million, high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end about three, if memory serves.)  What would you prefer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
That the mugger not be armed as well, and blow your gun-flashing 
<BR>
head off.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, I confess, every time I take public transport and have a gun with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, I imagine what I might do if that creep from the Long Island
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Railroad were to appear.  And sometimes I fantasize about getting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drop on Gianluigi Ferri, who shot eight people in the building where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now work (a year before I started there).  Guess that makes me one sick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuck, eh?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Yeppers, just like the character De Niro played in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.
