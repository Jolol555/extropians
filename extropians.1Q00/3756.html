Dan and Rob continued:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I do realize that effects such as consciousness are extraordinary from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the perspective of empirical science, but this method is not the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one available - sometimes one just has to accept that it's just a tool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; - the true discoveries, that is, the ideas that guide the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; implementation of the empirical method, come from good old fashioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; philosophizing.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah!  Go team!  Now, where do we begin?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmmm...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What were we looking for, again?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wait.  Rob, I'm glad you are one of the few with me on
<BR>
this but lets be careful.  I'm quite sure were not at all talking about
<BR>
something that is really all that &quot;extraordinary from the perspective
<BR>
of empirical science&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because, to date, all our empirical science has been
<BR>
concerned with is only cause and effect and when we are claiming that
<BR>
there could be more to &quot;qualities&quot; than just simple abstract cause and
<BR>
effect, in no way places qualia outside of every day empirical
<BR>
reproducible science.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I push on my eye in a completely dark room, it can
<BR>
produce a red sensation, even though there is no light in the room.
<BR>
This can be very empirical and scientific even if our understanding
<BR>
hasn't penetrated to the point where we can understand, eff, and
<BR>
scientifically share such feelings and qualities first hand.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple cause and effect scientific observations that we
<BR>
have done to date may have missed some phenomenal &quot;qualities&quot; of
<BR>
nature but it can't have missed much.  These phenomenal &quot;qualities&quot;
<BR>
that we are talking about must have some &quot;causal&quot; (as in objectively
<BR>
or scientifically in traditional ways) affect that is consistent with
<BR>
all we know of brain matter.  These &quot;qualities&quot; or what these
<BR>
representations are &quot;like&quot; must some how fit or be hiding within what
<BR>
we already know of the fundamental cause and effect nature of matter.
<BR>
The red strawberry is not at all like the green field of leaves.
<BR>
Because red is not like green is why our hand goes towards it to pick
<BR>
it.  Regular old abstract scientific instruments must be able to
<BR>
detect and model these behaviors just like anything else that
<BR>
influences or has a causal effect in reality.  They must prove, that
<BR>
red is like something and that whatever this is like, it is not like
<BR>
green, and that this is how we are able to have effect in the world
<BR>
and pick the red strawberry out of the green leaves.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of doing this will be every time an abstract machine
<BR>
objectively observes a particular set or pattern of neural firings (or
<BR>
whatever qualia &quot;objectively&quot; is) the brain always experience the
<BR>
precise qualia related to that and never anything else.  When the
<BR>
instrument says the brain is experiencing red, the brain will always
<BR>
experience red and nothing else.  The same with green and all other
<BR>
qualia.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's still good old empirical, reproducible... science, it's
<BR>
just now concerned with more than abstract cause and effect, but also,
<BR>
what is that cause and effect like when we experience phenomenal red
<BR>
and green.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we can do things like objectively understand what and why
<BR>
red is the way it is in our consciousness, when we can show others
<BR>
what our red, salty... is like and we can say that yes, indeed, it is
<BR>
the same, or it is different....  it'll still all be empirical
<BR>
objectively reproducible... science.  It's just that the brain is so
<BR>
complex, and good at simplifying or making us think that qualia is
<BR>
something out beyond our senses (or that it doesn't exist at all),
<BR>
that we've prematurely limited science to less than what it truly can
<BR>
be.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because red is still &quot;ineffable&quot;, doesn't mean it will
<BR>
always be.  It's just that effing is a bit different and in an
<BR>
engineering way a bit more complicated (self referential?) than simply
<BR>
abstractly knowing by cause and effect sensing and abstract
<BR>
representations that have no regard for what the fundamental
<BR>
phenomenal nature of the observed representation is.
<BR>
