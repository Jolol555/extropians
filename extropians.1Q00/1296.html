<P><EM>&gt; If the middle ages can be referred to as a 'god centered' view of the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and the renaissance can be referred to as a 'human centered' view of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  world, then what term is used to describe emerging phase of society ? If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  there is no term, what is the best representing of a society that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sentience/conscious centered ? 'sentience centered' ? (think: animal rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  movements, ethics of Singer, development of autonomous agents, creation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  new life forms, etc : there is a general trend towards the increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  understanding of sentience throughout philosophy, and the various moral and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ethical question as society heads down the path). I disagree with the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  'globalisation', because I think (and there it is much written) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  globalisation has been a continuing process, but only now resulting in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  'real' globalisation due to economic conditions and communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  technology. Hopefully I haven't displayed too much of my ignorance ;-).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think about this question a LOT, so hopefully, I won't have too much to say 
<BR>
about it :-)  
<BR>
<P>I think a very strong argument can be made that we're actually in a period of 
<BR>
cultural RENEWAL rather than one of complete INNOVATION.  Just as many people 
<BR>
in the Renaissance (and since) saw that time as a period of rediscovery and 
<BR>
renewal of humanist values found in some parts of classical culture, I think 
<BR>
our own time is one in which we are returning to the core values of the 
<BR>
Enlightenment.  [Note in this regard that I see the Renaissance and 
<BR>
Enlightenment as two distinct chapters in what was, nevertheless, a period 
<BR>
with significant continuity, as well.  The first chapter (1450?-1675? or 
<BR>
thereabouts) was primarily characterized by establishing the basics of the 
<BR>
scientific method (culminating in the work of Newton), exploration of the New 
<BR>
World and reformulating the relationship of religion and the state.  The 
<BR>
second chapter (1625? - 1815?) was characterized by a rapid application of 
<BR>
the scientific method across many disciplines, the development of many new 
<BR>
and powerful technologies as a result, settlement and development of the New 
<BR>
World and the reformulation of the relationship of the individual and the 
<BR>
state.]
<BR>
<P>In this view, one of the cultural tasks in which we are primarily involved 
<BR>
now is a process of recovering the values of the Enlightenment after what was 
<BR>
essentially a detour that began with the radicalization of the French 
<BR>
Revolution, then accelerated with Marxism and the pathologies of 
<BR>
hypertrophied nationalism and finally burned itself out in the nihilism and 
<BR>
paralyzing relativism of post-modernist &quot;deconstructivism&quot;.  Seen in this way 
<BR>
transhumanism and extropianism is really just the continuation of something 
<BR>
that was already underway, and is the logical extension of Renaissance and 
<BR>
Enlightenment humanism.
<BR>
<P>This historical contextualization doesn't lend itself to an easy summarizing 
<BR>
term like &quot;god-centered&quot; or &quot;human-centered&quot;, though.  Picking out any one of 
<BR>
the major strands of the historical dynamics described above doesn't seems to 
<BR>
miss the richness of the process and risks a too-early &quot;totalizing&quot; effect 
<BR>
(to use a term form the post-modernist vocabulary).  In hindsight, perhaps 
<BR>
something like &quot;mind-centered&quot; might end up being true and accurate, so far 
<BR>
as it goes, but I think it's too soon to make such generalizations.  If we 
<BR>
can avoid being derailed by reactionaries or destroyed by our own efforts, I 
<BR>
believe there's a good chance that this will be seen as the beginning of the 
<BR>
&quot;extropian&quot; era, using the term in the broadest sense.  Ultimately, though, 
<BR>
the notion of this age being &quot;centered&quot; on anything is perhaps ultimately 
<BR>
misleading: It will be a period of increasing diversity and complexity, and 
<BR>
perhaps one without a &quot;center&quot; at all.
