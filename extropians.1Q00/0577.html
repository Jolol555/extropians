<EM>&gt; Robert Bradbury
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Finally, I would strongly disagree with the perspective that once we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a nanoassembler, the nanosantas descend on our door steps. I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said it before and I'll say it again -- the limiting factors are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*designs*.
</EM><BR>
<P>And the designs that evolve alongside the actual assemblers and such may 
<BR>
result in unpredictable effects (i.e., in singularity).  Someone may, for 
<BR>
pointed example, develop a design for (or a design for a design for) uploading 
<BR>
or AI that can follow from basic assembler technology.  Discussions about the 
<BR>
economics of transition to nanotech are helpful to an extent; but we might not 
<BR>
see such transitions.  Whatever the case we must remember that while there 
<BR>
might not be one single breakthrough nothing, in whatever corporate or 
<BR>
economic or academic environment the work is done, will happen without strong 
<BR>
designs.
<BR>
<P>So we must ask now:
<BR>
<P>- How do we begin serious design-ahead now?
<BR>
- How do we encourage development (on an open-source basis)?
<BR>
- How do we guide and organize the design-ahead results?  (Ad-hoc
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;organization, Web site, institute?)
<BR>
<P>And a little later:
<BR>
<P>- How do we get the chance to apply these designs (first)?
<BR>
<P>We must focus and focus now.  We have the means of communication and 
<BR>
transmission of data and access to results of fundamental research.  Much 
<BR>
scientific work still needs to be done.  And the hackers are ready to begin.
<BR>
<P><P>Some inspirational material from [Engines of Creation] (end of Chapter 3):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the force of this situation: under development will be the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatest production tool in history, a truly general fabrication
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system able to make anything that can be designed---and a design
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system will already be in hand.  Will everyone wait until assemblers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appear before planning how to use them?  Or will companies and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries respond to the pressures of opportunity and competition by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designing nanosystems in advance, to speed the exploitation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assemblers when they first arrive?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This design-ahead process seems sure to occur; the only question is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it will start and how far it will go.  Years of quiet design
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress may well erupt into hardware with unprecedented suddenness
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wake of the assembler breakthrough.  How well we design
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead---and what we design---may determine whether we survive and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrive, or whether we obliterate ourselves.
