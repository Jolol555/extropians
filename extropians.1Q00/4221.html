<EM>&gt;The fact that such effects seem intractable NOW does not make the taming of

<EM>&gt;havce we heard fool know-it-all scientists branding this and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;impossible&quot; without foundation? A lot. We'll go places on the back of the

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That seems reasonable to me. Consequently, I think it premature to offer an
<BR>
&quot;explanation of mind&quot; until one has examined it thoroughly. To begin the
<BR>
examination, why do we need to explain mind?
<BR>
<P>You see, Max has asked, &quot;can mind be explained naturalistically or do we need to
<BR>
resort to a supernatural explanation?&quot;
<BR>
First, eliminate &quot;supernatural explanations,&quot; because they don't actually
<BR>
explain anything at all. That leaves Max's brain (&quot;Professor X&quot;) asking for a
<BR>
&quot;naturalistic&quot; explanation of mind. Does it seen natural to ask why the brain
<BR>
seeks an explanation of itself? Why do we want to know?
<BR>
<P>If you know why you want to know yourself, you know why you should proceed.
<BR>
If you don't know why you want to know yourself, you can't know how to proceed.
<BR>
So...
<BR>
Why do we need to explain mind?
<BR>
<P>Is it that we want to build one, even though we don't know how one works?
<BR>
No problem. People built flying machines, even though they didn't know how
<BR>
airplanes worked. They used the Trial and Error method. So, de Garis, Tom Ray,
<BR>
John Holland, Marvin Minsky, et al., will keep messing about until they put
<BR>
together an &quot;artilect&quot; that amazes everyone with its cognitive brilliance.
<BR>
<P>A wise artilect might compose a completely satisfying explanation of mind for
<BR>
Professor X. Then again, it might ask us why we need this explanation, because
<BR>
why we need it may determine the composition of the explanation. Not exactly
<BR>
like the physicist's observations influencing quantum effects, but you
<BR>
understand the correlation?
<BR>
<P>As a result of this, until we can say why we want an explanation, reason cannot
<BR>
proceed.
<BR>
I think we need to know ourselves before we can transcend ourselves.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>

&quot;I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some
<BR>
extremely odd things about this mailing list. I'm sure you'll agree that there's
<BR>
some truth in what I say.&quot;
