You seem to be assuming that governments have motives and are, indeed,
<BR>
rational actors. They aren't; they're coalitions, the behaviour of
<BR>
which is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the interaction of
<BR>
bureaucratic self-interest, elected officials trying to be re-elected,
<BR>
furious external lobbying (almost all of which is motivated by the most
<BR>
shallow, short-term desires of the lobbying organisations), and a vague
<BR>
perception of &quot;what the public want&quot; as filtered through the eyes of a
<BR>
bunch of mostly white, male, middle-aged-to-elderly, rich men.
<BR>
<P>The result is a mess. The current emphasis on terrorism and security,
<BR>
for example, isn't a deliberate conspiracy of control freaks; it's the
<BR>
result of a collision of interests -- journalists giving preferential
<BR>
coverage to &quot;shock&quot; news items (because of the audience figures it gets
<BR>
them), politicians reaping publicity by banging the &quot;something must
<BR>
be done&quot; drum, bureaucrats in institutions like the FBI or NSA looking
<BR>
for a reason to justify their salaries in the post-cold-war age, and a
<BR>
panicked public. (In reality, many more people die of lightning in the
<BR>
USA than of terrorist attacks. So why no multi- billion dollar agencies
<BR>
with huge budgets declaring a &quot;war on lighting&quot;?)
<BR>
<P>Don't expect a rational response to mature nanotech.  Given the way
<BR>
earlier developments have been treated, the first time it hits the public
<BR>
awareness will likely be when some sad person figures out how to use an
<BR>
assembler to manufacture sex toys or dildos or the like -- which will
<BR>
suddenly be the target of a moral panic. Politicians will be demanding
<BR>
that nanoassemblers be policed so that they can't manufacture handcuffs
<BR>
or condoms or french ticklers without a police warrant. They'll be
<BR>
demanding a &quot;V-chip&quot; to stop under-18's manufacturing contraceptives.
<BR>
<P>Remember -- the first sign of impending success for a new technology is
<BR>
a pornography/sex scare. And we all know how successful nanotech is going
<BR>
to be, right?
