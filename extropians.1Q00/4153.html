Advances in Molecular Biology and Pharmacology Fueling Rapid Growth in 
<BR>
Neuroprotectant Drug Discovery
<BR>
<P>March 2, 2000
<BR>
MedscapeWire
<BR>
<P>The burgeoning market for neuroprotective therapies targeting acute
<BR>
neurological
<BR>
disorders has led to the rapid development of pharmacological and surgical
<BR>
treatment strategies. Neuroprotective therapies for central nervous system
<BR>
(CNS)
<BR>
injury are becoming a primary focus of both the pharmaceutical and
<BR>
biotechnology industries.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Neuroprotectants Outlook: Next-Generation Therapies for Stroke, Traumatic
<BR>
Brain Injury, and Spinal Cord Injury&quot; is a new Decision Resources report
<BR>
that
<BR>
reviews the pharmacotherapeutic strategies in development for acute
<BR>
neuroprotection. The goal of these treatments is to prevent neuronal death
<BR>
in
<BR>
stroke and traumatic injury to the brain or spinal cord. Included in the
<BR>
report are
<BR>
a review of the current markets for acute neuroprotective agents and market
<BR>
projections in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury
<BR>
through 2010.
<BR>
<P>According to the report, tt is expected that by 2002, when neuroprotectants
<BR>
such
<BR>
as AstraZeneca's clomethiazole are projected to enter the major markets, the
<BR>
neuroprotectants will dominate the ischemic stroke market, with sales at
<BR>
least
<BR>
triple those of the thrombolytics. Bristol-Myers Squibb's BMS 20435Z and
<BR>
Bayer's repinotan (BAY X3702) could follow to market by 2003. Biotechnology
<BR>
products such as basic fibroblast growth factor and antiplatelet monoclonal
<BR>
antibodies could have a substantial commercial impact from 2005 onward; and
<BR>
apoptosis inhibitors and small molecules that induce neuronal growth factors
<BR>
(to
<BR>
inhibit cell death and stimulate neuronal regeneration) could establish
<BR>
themselves
<BR>
on the market toward the end of the decade. Sales of heparin to treat stroke
<BR>
will
<BR>
slowly decline over the next decade. By 2010, the overall market for acute
<BR>
neuroprotection in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke will total approximately
<BR>
$414 million. Once a market for acute neuroprotection comes into existence,
<BR>
the
<BR>
market for severe traumatic brain injury could reach $225 million, depending
<BR>
on
<BR>
the pricing of the drugs.

&quot;Some of us, perhaps because we are too old - or is it, too young - think
<BR>
there may be arrival at last, and if, the arrival comes, there may be still
<BR>
regret that the pursuit is over.&quot;
