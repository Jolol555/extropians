On Cryonet two prominent cryonics movement leaders have put forward their 
<BR>
thoughts.  I thought it would be interesting to allow people to read the two 
<BR>
posts, compare and them and come to their own conclusions.
<BR>
<P>Robert Ettinger of the Cryonics Institute considers it overall a bad idea.  
<BR>
He feels it could backfire and create bad feelings against cryonics not to 
<BR>
mention legal headaches.
<BR>
<P>Paul Wakfer on the other hand believes there is an enormous amount of 
<BR>
possibility in this area.  He plans to move forward and do something 
<BR>
concrete in this area if he can find the support.
<BR>
<P>Robert Ettinger has the more realistic take on things but then I admire the 
<BR>
determination of Paul Wakfer.  It should be interesting to see what he can 
<BR>
stir up!  Everyone duck! lol  If he is successful things may get very 
<BR>
interesting.  I still am saddened by the lack of support that he received 
<BR>
for the Prometheus Project.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>

Subject: freezing the aborted
<BR>
Freezing aborted fetuses is an old idea, discussed and abandoned several
<BR>
times. It has obvious potential attractions, but, in the opinion of most who
<BR>
have considered it, the downside dominates. Here are some of the risks:
<BR>
1. It would be seen by some as encouraging abortion, and arouse active
<BR>
opposition not only against the practice but against cryonics generally. (It
<BR>
might also arouse more sympathy in some quarters, but that would be less
<BR>
important.)
<BR>
2. &quot;Right to life&quot; people are unlikely to become more sympathetic, partly 
<BR>
for
<BR>
the reason mentioned above, and partly because, for many of them, the issue
<BR>
is not really &quot;right to life&quot; but opposition to interference with &quot;nature.&quot;
<BR>
Some of the churches oppose freezing sperm, eggs, or embryos, even though
<BR>
this tends to save or increase life.
<BR>
3. Although it is cheap to store a small piece of tissue, it would not be
<BR>
cheap to deal with the prospective clients; and those clients would tend to
<BR>
be unstable and unreliable people. A large investment of time and effort in
<BR>
each potential client would be required, and those turned down might 
<BR>
complain
<BR>
loudly. Lawsuits are guaranteed, with guaranteed losses in some 
<BR>
jurisdictions.
<BR>
Sad, but best forget it. Let's keep on trying to save ourselves and the
<BR>
people we know.Robert EttingerCryonics InstituteImmortalist Society

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unborn?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Mon, 17 Jan 2000 09:50:04 -0500&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Note: I sent this to the Extropy list over the weekend.)&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't know if anyone has thought of this before, but how about getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Right to Life individuals to support abortion by cryopreserving aborted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fetuses?  Surely, cryopreserving them would be cheaper.  If we can get them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to fund this sort of thing, it would be a way to both spread cryonics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defuse a very deep conflict in Western societies.&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps we could analyze this problem from two angles.  One would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technical feasability.  The other is whether Right to Life groups would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;willing to support-financially, politically, or morally-this option.&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What do you think?This is discussed at my website <A HREF="http://morelife.org">http://morelife.org</A>
</EM><BR>
I have been working on this on and off for over 4 years (mostly off for the 
<BR>
last
<BR>
2years)
<BR>
CryoSpan, Inc even entered into a contract with Cryogenic Solutions of Texas 
<BR>
to
<BR>
bethe repository of such aborted fetuses (they were going to be the public
<BR>
interface
<BR>
for promotion and marketing) but it all fell through and they never went 
<BR>
ahead
<BR>
with it. CryoSpan also atempted to become the repository of all the embryos 
<BR>
which
<BR>
havebeen created by in-vitro fertilization and are no longer wanted.
<BR>
Wrt funding, I believe there might even be a possibility of getting the 
<BR>
Catholic
<BR>
Church to fund such an endeavor.
<BR>
I am planning to again pursue the possibility of this business (and its 
<BR>
enormous
<BR>
potential for the promotion of the ideas of cryonics), later this year, and 
<BR>
I
<BR>
welcome anyone who wishes to join together to do this.
<BR>
I will try to find time to summarize all the pros and cons, obstacles and
<BR>
potential
<BR>
solutions, but I would rather do this to a select group of people who are
<BR>
pro-actively interested in effecting this rather than to a bunch on 
<BR>
potentially
<BR>
nit-picking dilettantes.Please also add this to the extropian thread.
<BR>
I used to be on that list, but I just don't have time for it currently.
<BR>
Thanks for bringing up this very important idea.-- Paul --
