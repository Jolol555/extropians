<P>OK let me try one angle:
<BR>
<P>0)  A person is on fire and you are standing by with an extinguisher.
<BR>
Would you not be saving a life, doing good etc, by putting them out?
<BR>
Sure, it would be murder to do otherwise.
<BR>
<P>1)  If a person has gotten a snakebite and you are standing there
<BR>
with a syringe filled with antivenom, what then?  Same as above.
<BR>
<P>2)  A person has a disease for which there is a known cure, and
<BR>
you are a doctor with that cure.  How now?  Same as above.
<BR>
<P>3)  A person has a disease for which there is no known cure, but
<BR>
there is good reason to believe there is a cure that can be found
<BR>
with a minimal amount of research.
<BR>
<P>You see where I am going with this.  At what point is humanity
<BR>
comfortable saying NO MORE RESEARCH to save lives?  At what
<BR>
point does it become nonmurder to quit searching new cures?
<BR>
<P>Nanotechnology is a field which promises cures far beyond our
<BR>
fondest dreams.  spike
