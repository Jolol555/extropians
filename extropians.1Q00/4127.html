</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abnormal mental architectures on this list because such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anomalies force us to learn cognitive 'tricks' thus creating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an interest in our own abilities, their limits, and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential for improvement?
</EM><BR>
<P>YES!  I have been thinking this way for some time, but
<BR>
Bryan's insightful question succinctly states the matter.  We
<BR>
must have a waaay larger than random concentration of
<BR>
minds on this list that have spent much time and effort
<BR>
examining themselves, or looking around inside their
<BR>
own brains, wondering what is there and why.
<BR>
<P>Consider: when people relate to others, we try to
<BR>
map our own feelings on theirs, so that we can relate
<BR>
and understand each other.  I am one who discovered
<BR>
at an early age that my own reasoning patterns do not
<BR>
map well onto other's feelings and reasoning patterns.
<BR>
So I try to compensate by various means.
<BR>
<P>For instance, my brother is a normal person.  He relates
<BR>
so well to others.  I watch him and try to figure out how he
<BR>
does it.  He can meet a new person and within minutes
<BR>
can  understand and relate.  I simply cant do that.  His thought
<BR>
patterns seem utterly bizarre to me, yet he is the social butterfly.
<BR>
Im the social... cockroach.  I do fine at the nanoschmoozes,
<BR>
but at a neighborhood party, forget it!  I can meet a random
<BR>
person, talk for five minutes, at the close of which we both
<BR>
are thinking: What is the MATTER with you?  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Surely this extro-group has spent serious time with introspection.
<BR>
Why are we so 3 sigma NT-ish?  Why can we discuss such
<BR>
things as uploading, uplifting, singularity, space cables,
<BR>
qualia, cryonics, nanotech... well pretty much all the
<BR>
bizarre stuff we talk about, and none of us even thinks it
<BR>
the least bit... strange?  Its this, friends:  most all of us here
<BR>
must have some mental architecture that is wired seriously
<BR>
different, yet we have all become quite skillful in compensating,
<BR>
in *acting like* normal humans, in order to get along in this
<BR>
century on this planet where we are trapped, this world filled
<BR>
with huuuumans.  spike
