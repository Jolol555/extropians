When I read such attention-getting articles as &quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need
<BR>
Us,&quot; my first reaction is &quot;why?&quot;  Why imagine that &quot;we&quot; aren't needed, and
<BR>
why involve &quot;us.&quot;
<BR>
A more attentive instant caused me to be curious about the nakedness of such
<BR>
a bold statement about fear in such a public forum -- Wired.  
<BR>
Thinking about the human form and reading Michelangelo's poem, placed within
<BR>
the article, I turned my attention to Marble Arch in London and the many
<BR>
people who have come to rant and rave about their fears.  I remembered
<BR>
passing that corner once in 1985 and I did have some form of fear.  It
<BR>
wasn't stirred by sophisticated future technologies, but by the mundane
<BR>
technology of the Tube subway getting me from John Clute's flat to my own
<BR>
lodgings. 
<BR>
Fear is an emotion that humans inherit, that transhumans try to understand
<BR>
and refine, and that posthumans (whatever we may be) may use for verve,
<BR>
perchance, or only have a distant memory of.
<BR>
Regardless, there is nothing wrong with apprehension.  It alerts us and
<BR>
warns us.  Being apprehensive about the future warrants understanding.
<BR>
Being frightful about the future warrants a movie script.  While a Shaman
<BR>
might say that the frightened person is obviously facing his or her fears or
<BR>
&quot;shadow&quot; (that naughty child in humans that gnaws at uncertainty while
<BR>
tempting limbic-combat); the transhumanist might be a bit more intent at
<BR>
wondering what developmental dementia occurred in his evolutionary trail.  
<BR>
&quot;For all its eloquence, Sagan's contribution was not least that of simple
<BR>
common sense - an attribute that, along with humility, many of the leading
<BR>
advocates of the 21st-century technologies seem to lack.&quot;   I differ with
<BR>
this statement.  Common sense is what we transhumanist aspire toward, in
<BR>
deference to Sagan, and in deference to our own selves.  It steers our
<BR>
intentions as we seriously try to understand and work with the technologies
<BR>
available and our possible future scenarios.  Kill-Joy's anthropomorphizing
<BR>
of our technologies to reflect human ignorance appears to be a low-blow
<BR>
reflection on the designers of such technologies.
<BR>
So many people hid behind fears while attempting to appear confident and
<BR>
clever.  Not kill-Joy. Kill-Joy exhibits his fears right smack in the middle
<BR>
of the guts of high-tech culture and carves out potent extropian names:
<BR>
Kurzweil, Moravec, Drexler for all to see.
<BR>
Doesn't kill-Joy read Wired?  While I can sympathize with his concerns
<BR>
(&quot;It's a moral and ethical obligation to see people in complex ways ...&quot;
<BR>
(Sontag)), I cannot accept his myopia. &quot;But if we are downloaded into our
<BR>
technology, what are the chances that we will thereafter be ourselves or
<BR>
even human?&quot; (Joy)  This type of phrasing would take the hardest of marbles
<BR>
and the strongest of diamonds to carve through the density of this
<BR>
single-track and isolated thinking.

&quot;Non ha l' ottimo artista alcun concetto 
<BR>
Ch' un marmo solo in sè non circonscriva 
<BR>
Col suo soverchio; e solo a quello arriva 
<BR>
La man che ubbidisce all' intelleto.&quot;
<BR>
Michelangelo
