You said...
<BR>
<P>Regarding Aging and Life Extension:
<BR>
<P>Sometimes I get the feeling that you guys are really that interested in
<BR>
life-extension, because I'm not hearing any real plans for finding ways to
<BR>
help promote research or real scientific ideas in this area. In a way, that
<BR>
scares me, because I'm pretty sure that all are the only ones vocal enough
<BR>
to have started caring about it in the first place.
<BR>
<P>OR, as my boss has said repeatedly--&quot;don't confuse effort and results&quot;. Are
<BR>
we just so much mush--sitting around and telling each other how great
<BR>
transhumanism is? Or are we going to do something...
<BR>
-------------------
<BR>
I say...
<BR>
<P>I'm the guy who frequently sticks his nose into this group and says &quot;what
<BR>
are you DOING&quot;...so, to your questions above, In December of 1998 I spoke
<BR>
with Bill Gross of Idealab about promoting life extensionist principles on
<BR>
the web in a stealthy manner...(to get past the memeplexes). He was jazzed,
<BR>
and in May, Idealab allocated capital for ventures on this trajectory, and
<BR>
recently invested in startups
<BR>
www.HealthAllies.com , and www.PersonalMD.com
<BR>
<P>reducing costs of medical procedures is a slam dunk life extensionist
<BR>
initiative...
<BR>
if the heart transplant costs $150,000 and I can't afford it, that could be
<BR>
a
<BR>
PROBLEM. If I could get procedures of the same quality for dramatically
<BR>
less cost, I might survive longer. That's the HealthAllies business.
<BR>
<P>The PersonalMD approach is ...&quot;The first consumer-oriented health
<BR>
information site that has the potential to save lives by providing consumers
<BR>
with the ability to truly take control of their own health records. This is
<BR>
especially important in emergency situations, where a physician might need
<BR>
someone's medical information immediately. PersonalMD.com makes it possible
<BR>
to find the medical and health information people need, from their own
<BR>
confidential medical records to scientific breakthroughs in disease
<BR>
management and health issues, by just pointing and clicking.&quot;
<BR>
<P>here's a couple of editorial points of view...
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.healthallies.com/pcworld.htm">http://www.healthallies.com/pcworld.htm</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.healthallies.com/latimes1.htm">http://www.healthallies.com/latimes1.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>$4+ million dollars was steered into near term practical life extension
<BR>
(I also invested personally cause the real test is &quot;money where your mouth
<BR>
is&quot;).
<BR>
<P>These sites may sound pedestrian, but please be assured that their current
<BR>
offerings are the just the beginning.
<BR>
<P>I'm absolutely delighted at hearing that more folks on this list are
<BR>
&quot;getting busy&quot;, or if they already were busy, are telling others about
<BR>
it...even writing the president is DOING something!!! Most breakthru
<BR>
initiatives when begun are all but hopeless and appear logically insane.
<BR>
<P>We should promote a new meme...&quot;I'm not waiting for someone else...i'm gonna
<BR>
find a way to do it MeSelf!&quot;
<BR>
<P>the nag
