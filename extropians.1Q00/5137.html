<P><EM>&gt; We are about to overcome the evil of all future death and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  suffering.  That's the easy part.  But, there will still be people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that are still dead, the only real &quot;evil&quot; that will remain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Hopefully, as Tippler, Moravec, and others have theorized, we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  find some way to achieve the ability to resurrect and eliminate all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  death that has occurred in the past also.  Then once this chore is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  complete, then and only then will it be a true and all good heaven,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  completely absent of evil, for all.  This is everyone's ultimate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  real purpose.  Then will we finally be free to have fun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  seeking to become all knowing, all powerful, and most important of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  all, all feeling.
</EM><BR>
<P>I liked your response to Joy's insularity. I am, however, wondering if there 
<BR>
is anyone beyond Moravec and Tipler who have had these concerns, and tried to 
<BR>
publish papers or essays that attempt to resolve the big &quot;D&quot; and I don't mean 
<BR>
Dallas? Seems sparse to the maximal extreme, to this mortal.  Like where are 
<BR>
these &quot;others&quot;?  This is not a dig, but an observation on current state of 
<BR>
affairs from am academic paper  p.o.v.
