<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 1) Re: Microlensing &amp; dark matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A partial answer can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/">http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is large-scale dark matter, while I was more interested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microlensing observations from the MACHO, OGLE, PLANET groups et al.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best explanation for their data is ~400 billion 0.3-0.5 M_sun objects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbiting our galaxy. But one of the many problems with this work is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can only look in very specific directions (nearby galaxies), so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extrapolations are *iffy*. The Hubble north and south deep fields suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the same problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hadn't heard *anything* about these folks before, and had simply assumed 
<BR>
that dark matter surveys of our own galaxy were impractical. Darn, now I  
<BR>
have something else to add to my reading lists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                                    If either of these is accurate, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some galaxies will &quot;go dark&quot; relatively quickly.  If star lifting is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible, then calculations by Robert Freitas show that you could consume
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of the fuel in the galaxy in relatively short order, probably leaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind burned out iron memory banks, some black holes and neutron stars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then they might colonize  &amp; consume neighboring galaxies that go dark, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The dark regions with mass are where life got lucky and got an early start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or is particularly aggressive in its energy use or colonization principles.
</EM><BR>
<P>A nifty idea, but it doesn't seem to match the data. If your scenario were 
<BR>
true I would expect the visible (unconsumed) galaxies to be separated some 
<BR>
distance from the dark matter. As is, visible galaxies seem to exist at 
<BR>
the juncture points of the dark matter filaments. 
<BR>
<P>As an aside, I once wrote a scenario (called 'Artifact') for a role-
<BR>
playing game in which I assumed that the dark matter was a single *large* 
<BR>
structure that had been built in hyperspace by powers unknown. The 
<BR>
player's job was to try and figure out both how and why.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 &amp; 3) Re: Self-replication &amp; evolution speed-limits...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Are these questions about the absolute limits under any circumstance (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which point I would say it looks to be around 1E-30 to 1E-40 seconds for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; both questions), or is it a question about what parameters are critical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to setting a particular speed limit under particular circumstances. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a far more complex, and IMHO a far more interesting question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They are questions about the minimum rates at which stuff can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built or evolve.  Since Tom McKendree and JoSH have pointed out that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fastest way to build stuff is to build ~0.6 the mass of your final product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as assemblers, then have the assemblers build the final product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (disassembling themselves as necessary), the question becomes how fast you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can build the mass of assemblers. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, then it seems that you are asking the second kind of question, where 
<BR>
the context of the replication/evolution is critical in order to derive an 
<BR>
answer. Your (partial) list of concerns:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                            Chemical reaction rates?  Tip movement time?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Delivery of material to the tip?  Heat removal?  What makes the fastest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material?  Do TiC &quot;biochemistries&quot; do better because it can tolerate higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating temperatures (i.e. less volume and energy needs to be devoted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heat removal)?
</EM><BR>
<P>all seem to make strong assumptions about the physical and chemical makeup 
<BR>
of the assemblers being used, not to mention particular engineering 
<BR>
principals. I would expect that any rates calculated on the design of 
<BR>
first generation assemblers to go out the window for the second or third 
<BR>
generation. 
<BR>
<P>For example, you seem to be imagining a homogenous soup of one type of 
<BR>
assembler doing all of the work. They are provided with materials and 
<BR>
chemical compounds and they build new assemblers atom by atom. This seems 
<BR>
likely as a first version approach. 
<BR>
<P>A more mature technology (pulling a random idea out of the air) might 
<BR>
involve a very different sort of assembler that floats in some kind of 
<BR>
fractionated electrorheological fluid. In such a fluid the nano-, meso- 
<BR>
and bulk structures would form in reaction to tiny patterns of electrical 
<BR>
activity. The &quot;assemblers&quot; would be intricate energy modulators that would 
<BR>
attempt to insure that electrons in the neighboring fluid were moving in 
<BR>
the desired patterns to produce the needed local structure.
<BR>
<P>Could we make such a liquid? I dunno. I'm just trying to point out that 
<BR>
the ultimate limits to how fast things can reproduce or be formed into the 
<BR>
right shapes stronly depend on the underlying technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With evolution its a similar can of worms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that I'm not sure its as well-defined a problem. If a 'unit' of 
<BR>
evolution is the creation of a new useful mutation, then all you need is 
<BR>
enough self-replicators randomly mutating themselves and you get one 
<BR>
improvement per generation. (Ignoring local maxima on the fitness plane, 
<BR>
and other hairy complications.) This doesn't seem a terribly *useful* 
<BR>
definition of evolution. If you start trying to make it more realistic by 
<BR>
considering rates of spread of a mutation through a species, and the 
<BR>
possibility of a changing environment, and the murk rapidly gets thicker.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Xenology by Robert Freitas lays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a foundation for some of the various &quot;natural&quot; biochemistries that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist in the universe.  Does life develop in any of them?  Does it develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster or slower?  How dependent is the rate of evolution on the available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mass?  Operating temperature?  Mutation sources?  Global-scale stresses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (extinction events)?  Are there artificial biochemistries in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution can proceed more quickly?
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, without knowing exactly how you are measuring 'evolution', I can't 
<BR>
even figure out which of the above questions are meaningful, and which are 
<BR>
not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Re: number of useful &quot;biochemistries&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wasn't so much interested in Carbon/Water biochemistries (there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly lots of those) as Carbon/Ammonia or Carbon/H2S or systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based Si or TiC or InGaAs.  You have 92 natural elements, how many ways can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they be put together to produce self-replicating systems that can &quot;host&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent consciousness?  For extra credit determine which chemistries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are optimal for the architectures in Question 9...
</EM><BR>
<P>So, I would say the number is very, very, very large indeed. If you allow 
<BR>
a definition of life from complexity theory, then its possible to devise 
<BR>
*political voting systems* that are alive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6) Re: Breakout of amoral alife...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; About the same probability that a chemist mixing amino acids in a lab
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will accidentally create a plague-form capable of wiping out our species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not clear.  There are a few labs doing life creation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution of enzymes experiments and those experiments presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work with moderately large number of molecules.  But, there are a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of bits flying around and that high rate of growth means that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantity of information being played with by computers exceeds the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantity being played with in chemistry experiments at some point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would an AmoralAlife@Home program find the &quot;dark&quot;-ring before the chemists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do?
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that if your typical chemical frankenbug escaped into the 
<BR>
wild then the current denizens, having evolved in a tooth-and-nail 
<BR>
environment would simply eat it. By the time we have a computer and 
<BR>
communication infrastructure sophisticated enough to host programs to 
<BR>
which I would be willing to grant the title of 'alive' to, it will be just 
<BR>
as hostile to digital frankenbugs.
<BR>
<P>As far as I can see, one absolute requirement for the spontaneous creation 
<BR>
of life is a sterile environment for it to happen in, so that it can 
<BR>
survive long enough to adapt, and I can't see that happening *by 
<BR>
accident*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Note that this is a vastly lower probability than the chance that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deliberately constructed, amoral, self-evolving, self-replicating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; AI/Alife will &quot;breakout&quot; by accident.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have examples of those today with computer viruses.  Fortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there aren't any nanoassemblers for them to take over and the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing the ALife work are pretty responsible and we seem to be getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better at producing firewalls and speeding up the rate at which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software loophole fixes are applied (for example there are bots now that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crawl the net warning people about security holes).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but I'm not sure I'm willing to call a computer virus 'alive' in any 
<BR>
meaningful sense. Then again, I'm somewhat iffy on the question of how 
<BR>
alive a biological virus is. As to the Alife researchers, I'm one myself 
<BR>
on occasion, and there simply isn't a need to take precautions. One of my 
<BR>
little creations could no more survive in my computer without its 
<BR>
environmental support structure, than a typical computer virus could 
<BR>
survive in my stapler.
