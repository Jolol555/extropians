<EM> &gt;   [side bar, note this day in history -- while Eugene and I agree &quot;generally&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;    on most things, we seldom seem to agree 100% on anything. :-)]
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a somewhat wrong impression, since I only post when I disagree
<BR>
with you. Me-too posts do not contribute to signal and are hence
<BR>
noise. When I don't post, I agree with you 110%.

<BR>
<EM> &gt; The 3d molecular circuits are going to be limited by the speed of sound
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the material determining propagation delays, but these will be much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; much faster than diffusion in solution.  Faster yet will be optical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computronium due to the decreased mass of the photons and faster
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; transit times.  What remains unclear is exactly *how* small we can
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, when I think computronium I don't mean buckygears a la NASA AMES
<BR>
or similiar. Electrons are much more mobile than nuclei
<BR>
(Franck-Condon), and hence computation should be done with
<BR>
electrons. Photons are good for long-distance signalling, and for
<BR>
providing power (laser-pumped computronium). Photons are big, unless
<BR>
you use SNOM type of magic, and they typically switch only at high
<BR>
fluxes (NLO), which makes them truly lousy switches. Also, with image
<BR>
processing tricks (thinning et al.)  you can use a projected
<BR>
macroscopic bitmap as I/O for computronium blocks. Look ma, no
<BR>
wires. (This is useful in the early stages when you grow computronium
<BR>
in the vat from autoassembling protein-circuitry complexes (protein
<BR>
because you need a lot of control in regards to complementary
<BR>
shapes, and it's the only easy available bootstrap technology)).
<BR>
<P>Once you have mechanosynthetic nano, you can go ballistic electronics
<BR>
in buckytubes. Graphenes are hardy, have a good (albeit strongly
<BR>
anisotropic) heat conductivity, and one could imagine pumping
<BR>
cryofluids through orthogonal buckytube channels through the main
<BR>
crystal. Reversible computation (amount of ones and zeros stays the
<BR>
same) will also help a lot here.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; get the transmitters &amp; receivers of the photons (compared with atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; or electrons).  If we can get to the point of pumping single-atom electron
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; energy states reliably using single photons (which is different from quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computing), then we shall have really really dense and really really fast
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computronium indeed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Recent results seem to indicate that charge transfer in photosynthetic
<BR>
antenna complex is not so very sophisticated and fine-tuned as one
<BR>
would assume. One can use tricks like these to harvest energy for
<BR>
optically pumped computronium, since otherwise you need photon fluxes
<BR>
high enough that you're destroying the circuitry.
