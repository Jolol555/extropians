[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Nearly every security expert I know won't 
<BR>
use Windows on their personal machines (I don't).  Everyone is aware 
<BR>
of the security issues that arise with Microsoft and it is common 
<BR>
knowledge that many intelligence workers have cover jobs with various 
<BR>
corporations.  But I don't place complete confidence in the French 
<BR>
either.  Kenn Cukier formally of Communications Week International 
<BR>
and now the International Editor at Red Herring had this interesting 
<BR>
paper on France's spy network.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&quot;France reportedly has developed its own &quot;Frenchelon&quot; -- a worldwide 
<BR>
network of spy satellites and listening stations that systematically 
<BR>
eavesdrop on communications in the United States and elsewhere. 
<BR>
Monitoring stations are said to exist in French Guiana, in the city 
<BR>
of Domme in the Dordogne region of southwestern France, in New 
<BR>
Caledonia, and in the United Arab Emirates. The information gleaned 
<BR>
is reportedly used for both political and commercial ends. 
<BR>
Additionally, some speculate that the French project may mark the 
<BR>
first step in a pan-European effort to counterbalance the U.S.'s 
<BR>
global spying capabilities. Germany is said to partially fund 
<BR>
France's initiative in return for access to the information it 
<BR>
collects.&quot;]

Subject: MS Funded/Founded by NSA?
<BR>
<P><P>A French intelligence report alleges that Microsoft was
<BR>
set up with NSA funding and that NSA imposed MS-DOS
<BR>
on IBM, and also alleges that NSA agents are now working
<BR>
at Microsoft:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://cryptome.org/nsa-ms-spy.htm">http://cryptome.org/nsa-ms-spy.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>The full confidential report has not been published and these
<BR>
allegations are made by an intelligence newsletter which
<BR>
claims to have seen it. The Age, an Australian newspaper,
<BR>
has reported on the topic today -- that account leads the file
<BR>
above.
<BR>
<P>The NSA MS key revelation appears in the reports, and may
<BR>
have prompted the intelligence investigation and speculation,
<BR>
along with the April 1999 report for Europarl, due to be considered
<BR>
by EuroParl in a week, which also warns of Microsoft's and Intel's
<BR>
possible cooperation with US intelligence to use Winte as a spying
<BR>
tool.
<BR>
<P>Still, we had not before seen an allegation that NSA was in on
<BR>
the gitgo with Microsoft and that DOS had been forced upon
<BR>
IBM. Is that old news or new, or merely a French counterattack
<BR>
on Echelon-like espionage?
