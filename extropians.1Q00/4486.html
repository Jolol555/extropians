<P>Thanks, but no thanks: the USA has exactly the same virus, it's just that
<BR>
your political system conceals the symptoms a bit better. 
<BR>
<P>I decided (back in 1994, when the control-freak symptoms endemic in the
<BR>
British political process were becoming glaringly obvious) to try the
<BR>
how-to-get-an-elephant-up-an-oak-tree approach: move to Scotland and
<BR>
wait for independence. It shouldn't take too many years -- given the way
<BR>
the control freaks in Westminster manage to annoy everyone north of the
<BR>
border -- and the Scots are generally a bit less small-c conservative[*]
<BR>
than their southern neighbours (modulo a few fringe religious groups).
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the lunar shuttle sounds quite appealing ...

<P>[*] The kind of conservativism that views with suspicion anyone who
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't aspire to a Ford Mondeo, a mortgage, spouse, two point
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one kids, and a family pet; the kind of conservativism that fuels
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demands for bans on firearms ownership or GM crops: the kind of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conservativism that is so afraid of leaving home that it wants to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ban the outside world.
