<P>
<EM>&gt; CT, I need to do some more work on the ante/payoff matrix,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but in the meantime, suppose you are Charlie, and I am Alpha.
</EM><BR>
<P>this...after I info(rmed) you that I would most certainly play...if I could
<BR>
be A(lpha). But instead you reassign the positions...and the payoff appears
<BR>
in a state of flux!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Amara sprinkled a bit of NaSi on her food in order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to improve its flavor.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am betting that the French Literature student will recognize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only that NaSi is some kind of chemical and will find a periodic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chart and guess that I have:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Na = element 11.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +Si = element 14.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; =25
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; She will be thinking aquarium, and guess 25 pets.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, Bravo tells Delta: 25. Bravo is wrong. Alpha and Charlie each clear
<BR>
$150...a $50 profit@.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am betting that you, CT, are trained in the sciences,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and since you see from the original list of players that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am trained in chemistry,  therefore I could not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made such an absurd error as NaSi.
</EM><BR>
<P>au contraire. NaSi to indicate the compound sodium silicate = Na2O.NSiO2
<BR>
2(Na) + 1(Si) = 3 pets
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You will realize that of course Amara sprinkled NaCl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon her dinner
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I did wonder about the NaCl connection...and then pondered the fact
<BR>
that you didn't say Amara had dusted her dinner with some substance...and
<BR>
then queried the anhydrous powder forms of NaSi...but then I ........
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you correctly ascertain that I have 3 pets,
</EM><BR>
<P>Ya! Charlie tells Delta that Alpha has 3 pets. Alpha and Charlie each clear
<BR>
$150...once again. If Bravo guesses wrong or Charlie guesses right, Charlie
<BR>
gets $150. Charlie is lazy and so subversively(?) assists Bravo in
<BR>
'realizing' that 25 is indeed the correct answer. Charlie pockets the $150
<BR>
early-on and has time for one more game.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you have given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me a huge clue as to your identity, for it would take at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a modicum of chemistry sophistication to recognize NaSi as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an impossible combination of elements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Alpha could have tricked Charlie into thinking that the answer was 3
<BR>
when the correct answer was some other number. Then Charlie would
<BR>
incorrectly report 3 to Delta. Alpha and Bravo would pocket $150@. But Alpha
<BR>
was planning on cashing in some LMT to pay for the dent his bike made when
<BR>
he crashed into his neighbor's humvee. Unfortunately, Alpha's LMT isn't
<BR>
worth much more than Charlie's IRIDQ, so Alpha would really like to score
<BR>
the $200 pay-off. Therefore, Alpha lets Charlie know that the final solution
<BR>
will require two messages from Alpha separated by feedback (NaSi = 3  being
<BR>
part 1). Alpha learns Charlie's identity and gives it to Delta before
<BR>
sending the second message to Charlie. Alpha gets $200, Bravo and Charlie
<BR>
get $50 each.
<BR>
<P>Alpha is a defector. What do you think Charlie's strategy will be the next
<BR>
time Charlie plays a game with Alpha?
<BR>
<P>But one game deserves another, reciprocal altruism after all. I assume the
<BR>
same 20 lifeforms will make up the pool of potential players?
<BR>
<P>ct
