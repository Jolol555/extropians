<BR>
<EM>&gt;Where could it have made the turn? I think the only obvious point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where humanity might have made a truly irreversible choice is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;development of agriculture. Once you have it, a lot of things change:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;population increase, cultural changes, plagues and cities become hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to avoid (?). If we somehow had avoided it and remained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hunter-gatherers humanity would have remained stable. Now we have got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;onto the change track instead.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think humanity made a wrong turn when it began to imagine explanations for
<BR>
mind/brain without having sufficient empirical information. Instead of seeing
<BR>
itself as one evolutionary awareness, humanity divided itself into warring
<BR>
tribes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Without cities tyrants will just tyrranize their tribe and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neighbours, but clearly tyrrany is older than cities and would still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been present in a hunter-gatherer humanity. In fact, when we look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at our primate relatives we find quite a bit of tyrrany going on, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the reasons for tyrrany seems to go back far into our evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;past. Increased technology and population has just made tyrants more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, we (all of humanity) need to end the conflict, because otherwise, with
<BR>
ultra-technology, conflict will end us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Superstition (I define it as doing and thinking things there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compelling reasons to think they are correct) is also much older than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agriculture. If cave paintings were intended to improve the hunt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;magically (as opposed to give instruction or act as decoration) then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have at least 50,000 years of superstition. And there have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;signs of ceremonial burial of neanderthal humans with flowers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tools, suggesting a belief in an afterlife around 70,000 years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, superstition continues to the present day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Anumals can easily become superstitious when given operant training -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you intermittently reward a pidgeon for pecking at a certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;symbol, and it happens to stand on one leg when it gets a reward, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sometimes develop the association &quot;symbol peck + one leg = reward&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will always stand on one leg. I expect that we have had superstition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long before we climbed down from the trees.
</EM><BR>
<P>Irrational thinking includes, but is not limited to superstition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So tyrrany and superstition are really older than Homo sapiens. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are not something we chose and fell out from a golden age, but rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something we want to get rid of to reach a future golden age.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, then transhumanism means the movement of humanity past superstition and
<BR>
tyranny. Technology may be separate from this movement, but not incidental to
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>The effort to _become_ something may actually have been the beginning of the
<BR>
wrong turn for humanity. That looks like where the conflict began -- a long time
<BR>
ago.
<BR>
