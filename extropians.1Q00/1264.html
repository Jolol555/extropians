<P>Speak for yourself.
<BR>
<P>There's a knack to disrupting the binding, the sequitur, between
<BR>
thoughts and the emotions they trigger.  The link has an affective
<BR>
component; there's an abstract thought that binds to disrupting the
<BR>
affective component, which disables the link, which pretty much switches
<BR>
off the emotion.  (No, I'm not going to tell the world how it works. 
<BR>
This is one of the very very few software tricks that can actually
<BR>
damage your mind, or at least your personality, if you're not careful.)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I can disable emotional hooks, at least with respect to minor
<BR>
emotions.  I don't know if the trick works with respect to intense
<BR>
emotions because I've never tried it; intense emotion is rare enough in
<BR>
my life that I tend to treasure it.  But I really don't think I would
<BR>
have much trouble grokking unemotional humans.  In retrospect, I would
<BR>
say that most of the &quot;inability to understand&quot; is the inability to
<BR>
visualize, imposed by the tendency to flinch away from the imagining. 
<BR>
Once you've disabled the flinch and gotten some practical experience
<BR>
operating disanthropically - that is, trying to eliminate everything
<BR>
that belongs to &quot;human minds&quot; or &quot;evolved minds&quot; rather than &quot;minds in
<BR>
general&quot; - it really isn't that hard.
<BR>
<P>After all, our tendency to attribute various emotional properties to the
<BR>
concept of &quot;emotion&quot; is itself an anthropomorphism; from a cosmic
<BR>
perspective, emotion is simply the functioning of various rules of human
<BR>
cognitive science.  If you can pick up enough disanthropy, or
<BR>
philosophy, to stop being emotional about emotions (plus enough
<BR>
cognitive science to know where all the emotions are), then no, it isn't
<BR>
impossible to think like an emotionless human.
