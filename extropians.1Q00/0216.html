<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galileo Mission Status
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 4, 2000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers say it appears that NASA's Galileo spacecraft has 
<BR>
chalked up its first successful encounter of the year 2000.  This 
<BR>
encounter began when the spacecraft flew over Jupiter's icy moon 
<BR>
Europa on Monday morning, January 3, at an altitude of 351 
<BR>
kilometers (218 miles).  Galileo then performed observations of 
<BR>
three of Jupiter's smaller moons -- Amalthea, Thebe and Metis -- 
<BR>
at 7:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Monday.  The encounter was 
<BR>
capped off with several observations of Jupiter's volcanic moon 
<BR>
Io at about 4 a.m. PST Tuesday, January 4.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacecraft is operating normally, and engineers believe 
<BR>
all the observations were successfully recorded on Galileo's 
<BR>
onboard tape recorder.  The recordings will be transmitted to 
<BR>
Earth starting on Wednesday, January 5.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this flyby, it appears that Galileo's instruments 
<BR>
completed observations designed to detect any magnetic 
<BR>
disturbances triggered by electrical currents set up in a 
<BR>
possible ocean lying beneath Europa's icy crust.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Galileo passed behind Europa during the flyby, its 
<BR>
radio signal to Earth was blocked.  Scientists studied the signal 
<BR>
changes to learn more about the moon's ionosphere -- a region of 
<BR>
charged particles that surrounds it -- and any possible 
<BR>
atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiation levels during this encounter were about average 
<BR>
for the region.  The only apparent effects of the radiation were 
<BR>
false indications of computer resets onboard the spacecraft, a 
<BR>
common radiation-related occurrence during previous Galileo 
<BR>
encounters.  Onboard software successfully handled these errors, 
<BR>
and the flyby continued.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December 1995, Galileo has been orbiting Jupiter and 
<BR>
its moons, passing through a zone of intense radiation.  In fact, 
<BR>
the spacecraft has already survived more than twice the radiation 
<BR>
it was designed to withstand, and it has beamed to Earth 
<BR>
unprecedented images and other information.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology, 
<BR>
Pasadena, CA, manages the Galileo mission for NASA's Office of 
<BR>
Space Science, Washington, DC.
