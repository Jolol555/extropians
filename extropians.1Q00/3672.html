<P>
Well, I'm back after a week away... including 14 hour plane
<BR>
flights (blech, phooey), where are the supersonic planes???
<BR>
noticing the thread abundance, AI/EI/IA, cryonics, more
<BR>
AI/EI/AI, cryonics, and then a bicycle discussion?!?
<BR>
<P>I think some of the folks on the list need to get out more.
<BR>
<P>In an effort to bring some variety to the list... The
<BR>
Conde Nast Traveler March 2K issue had an interesting
<BR>
look at &quot;The Next 7 Wonders&quot;, including the
<BR>
&quot;Burj Al Arab&quot; hotel, an interesting view of which
<BR>
can be found at:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.class1.worldoffshore.com/results99/dubai/images.htm">http://www.class1.worldoffshore.com/results99/dubai/images.htm</A>
<BR>
or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.travel-news.org/mideast.html">http://www.travel-news.org/mideast.html</A> (somewhat slow)
<BR>
<P>Gets my vote as the coolest place to stay.
<BR>
<P>Of interest that came up when researching the Burj, was an article
<BR>
about water fountains:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.pmengineer.com/archives/9907Feature.htm">http://www.pmengineer.com/archives/9907Feature.htm</A>
<BR>
I saw the Bellagio Fountains in Dec. with Robert Freitas when
<BR>
we were walking around Las Vegas.  Very very cool.  If the Burj
<BR>
fountains are comparable, it is clearly a destination worth visiting.
<BR>
<P>Query: How many Extropians would be interested in and able to attend
<BR>
an Extropy convention at a &quot;destination&quot; location (e.g. the Burj, if
<BR>
they had a year or two of advance notice to budget for the trip???)
<BR>
[For reference, Seattle to Dubai(RT):$~1500 + 4 nights @ $258/n = $~2500
<BR>
+ conference fee: $500 = $~3000?.]
<BR>
<P>It seems that one interesting strategy for the Extropy Institute
<BR>
in a &quot;propaganda&quot; mode would be to promote highly visible conferences
<BR>
at &quot;name&quot; destinations that would encourage imaginative thinking.
<BR>
<P>One of the 7 wonders was the new
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Bibliotheca Alexandrina&quot;,
<BR>
see:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.unesco.org/webworld/alexandria_new/">http://www.unesco.org/webworld/alexandria_new/</A>
<BR>
including Real-Player and VRML pointers.
<BR>
<P>And then finally of interest is the cruise ship &quot;Voyager of the Sea&quot;
<BR>
(@ 142,000 tons), holding 3,838 passengers, roughly the size of
<BR>
the Empire State Building...
<BR>
<P>Now... In relation to &quot;big things humans build&quot;.... is an article...
<BR>
&quot;The Tsiolkovski Tower Re-examined&quot; (Jnl. British Interplanetary
<BR>
Soc. 52:175-180 (1999)), by  Geoffry A. Landis and Craig Cafarelli.
<BR>
(Landis is at the NASA Lewis Research Center in Ohio).
<BR>
<P>The abstract:
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;It is possible to make a tower which extends upwards from the surface
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Earth into space.  An equation for the taper ratio of such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a tower is calculated under the assumption that the taper is chosen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the stress in the material is independent of height.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass of the tower will then depend on the height of the material
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen.  For a structure extending all the way to geosynchronous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;orbit, the mass of a compression structure of the tower and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;characteristic stength-to-density ratio (&quot;tower&quot;) is less than that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a tension structure (&quot;skyhook&quot;) for the same ratio of strength
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to density.  A structure which connects a tension structure at high
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;altitiudes with a compression structure at low altitudes has lower mass
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;than either a tension or compression structure alone.  A mass of 3.5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;million tons was calculated for such a structure sized to carry a payload
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of 22.7 tons, using graphite-epoxy construction.  Towers of height
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;less than geosynchronous orbit were also examined.  A 2280 km tall
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tower was shown to be feasible with current materials technology, with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a mass of only 365 tons.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Lets see, 142,000 tons vs. 3.5 million tons, so for 25x the cost of
<BR>
a vacation cruise ship we can build a tower that can support hoisting
<BR>
into geosynchronous orbit masses of 22.7 tons (space shuttle payloads).
<BR>
<P>Hmmmm, sounds like the &quot;Burj Al Arab&quot; is just built a little too low,
<BR>
but I wouldn't mind visiting there until we get the Space Tower off
<BR>
the ground.
<BR>
