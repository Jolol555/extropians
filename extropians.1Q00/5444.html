<P>|I see two problems with Michael's view.  One is that the article, in fact,

<P>I have heard stated that when the Germans occupied Norway during WWII the new
<BR>
government decreed that all radio transmitters and rucksacks were to be handed
<BR>
over to the government.
<BR>
<P>All radio transmitters were colleted, but only two (2) rucksacks.
<BR>
The transmitters were registered, while the rucksacks were not.
<BR>
<P>True, or not, but this illustrates the problem with government registers.
