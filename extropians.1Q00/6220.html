<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I read how in the U.S. Marine Corps the drill instructors call the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very obese recruits 'baby whales' and at the end of the 13 weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these trainees have lost weight and toned up quite alot due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loving attention of their instructors in making sure they get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough exercise and don't overeat. ;)  Now, we have overweight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yuppies paying former drill instructors good money to give them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sort of ferociously loving attention most nineteen year-olds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dread.  But of course it is not really the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;baby whales?&quot; I doubt a Marine Drill Instructor was ever that
<BR>
kind.
<BR>
<P>As a former Marine I can tell you how they did it back in '75. ( I
<BR>
was 17) Those who were determined to be considerably overweight
<BR>
were shipped off to the fatbody platoon. 
<BR>
<P>They were subjected to rigorous extra workouts and a very limited
<BR>
diet.
<BR>
<P>The really tough part was that these unfortunates were in limbo
<BR>
during this. Their training was suspended till they came down to
<BR>
appropriate weight, then they had to join an existing platoon at
<BR>
the appropriate place in the training cycle. This also effected
<BR>
enlistment time.
<BR>
<P>Some were in bootcamp for six months or more.....
