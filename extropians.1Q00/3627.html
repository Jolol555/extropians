<EM>&gt;  &gt; 1. The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever (Trilogy) by Stephen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; R. Donaldson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, there is a second series, so it's a hexalogy in toto. None
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of it extremely exciting. Unless you've got a Hansens' disease fetish...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Agreed. Which is why I didn't list it as books I recommend from Fantasy.
<BR>
What I believe is most relevant in these books (at least to the list
<BR>
members) is the moral/ethical implications the anti-hero Thomas Covenant
<BR>
wrestles with after finding himself transported to the dream-like &quot;Land&quot;
<BR>
where he is expected to be their savior. It's more complicated than this
<BR>
summary, but this is the basic idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; 2. The Nine Princes of Amber (Five book set) by Roger Zelazny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About the worst you can get from Roger Z. Decent by common fantasy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards, but really not too hot. Read anything by him but that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
There's a second series of five here too. I didn't mention it because I
<BR>
don't recommend it over the others I've already listed. I think you are
<BR>
a little too harsh here, Eugene. For originality this set sits near the
<BR>
top. For character development (remember, this is all within the context
<BR>
of Fantasy literature) it is also an excellent read. For its extropy
<BR>
value, I would read it with an eye towards how the hero rises up against
<BR>
the system to create something more in his Libertarian-esque image.
<BR>
<P>To be sure, he has written better stuff, but I would hardly suggest
<BR>
avoiding this altogether.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; 3. The Black Company (Eight book set, and counting) by Glen Cook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 4. The Riddle Master of Hed (Trilogy) by Patricia A. McKillip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 5. The Lord of the Rings (Trilogy) by J. R. R. Tolkein
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The etalon. No more, no less. 'nuff said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Etalon? I have to admit I couldn't find anything on the connection
<BR>
between that word and the books I mentioned above. I will also admit to
<BR>
not looking all that hard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; 6. The Dark Tower (Four book set, and counting) by Stephen King
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of it pretty decent, as I recall. I still stand and fall by &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last Stand&quot;, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
An excellent book.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; 7. The Dragon Prince (Trilogy) by Melanie Rawn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds familiar, but that's about it.
</EM><BR>
Political machinations, ethical dilemmas about the treatment of other,
<BR>
&quot;alien&quot; intelligences (the Dragons), elitism, how emotions affect
<BR>
rational thought and the impact that has on the acquisition of magical
<BR>
skill (i.e., the cost of gaining transhuman-like abilities), etc.
<BR>
<P>Btw, I should have mentioned in my initial reply that I would lump
<BR>
Aristoi into the SciFi-Fantasy hybrid genre. Anytime you have martial
<BR>
arts living side by side with nanotechnology, I think you have a
<BR>
combination book.
<BR>
<P>I'd be extremely interested in your recommendations from Fantasy (if
<BR>
any).
