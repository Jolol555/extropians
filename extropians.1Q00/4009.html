<P><EM> &gt; of documents, ranked by priority.  When a document is fetched, its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rank is increased and that of all others is lowered.  When documents'
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rankings drop below a certain level, they are deleted from the node,
</EM><BR>
<P>This kinda reminds me of Python's GC reference counter model. One
<BR>
could also implement a (glacially slow) bitrot, where constantly
<BR>
decrementing counters are being incremented by accesses (ok, in your
<BR>
model the clock ticks whenever an access occur. if one node never sees
<BR>
hits, objects in it can become infinitely stale). Objects evaporate
<BR>
when counters fall below zero.
<BR>
<P>It would also be nice to know when the last instance of an object on
<BR>
the network is about to face the great bitbucket in the sky. Maybe
<BR>
some kind soul will grant it immortality in a bulk storage
<BR>
archive. (Otoh, it will be probably called the Great Archive of Crap,
<BR>
not even attractive to practising kibologists).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; This produces a sort of crude &quot;economy&quot;, where document requests are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; treated like payment to keep documents present in the system.  Documents
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; which are requested more often get higher rankings and get replicated on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; multiple servers.  Documents which are requested too rarely eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; get dropped from the system.
</EM><BR>
<P>If creating content has a cost, one could keep all of them. Available
<BR>
storage is expanding exponentially.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; It's a highly unbalanced and fragile system which is unlikely to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; much robustness.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; However it could still be a good testbed for the basic mechanisms for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; storing documents, moving them around, and so on.  If the ranking system
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; were updated to be more reasonable (based on real payments, for example)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; then it could grow into a more stable system.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is really unfortunate that all the usable algorithms for digicash
<BR>
have a lock on them, in legalspace. Someone oughta rescue all these
<BR>
poor bits, and bring them into circulation.
