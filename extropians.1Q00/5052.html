<EM>&gt;     &gt;France's entire nuke  program  is made up of breeder reactors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The entire program? I don't think so!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;which are also capable of burning off nuclear  waste.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Burning off? Please explain what that means. Exactly what nuclear waste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product are we talking about? What is the nuclear reaction that renders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this &quot;waste&quot; harmless. What stops this &quot;burning&quot; from making more waste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than it gets rid of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because how you tune the reactor determines whether you are creating
<BR>
more plutonium or fissioning it away into other lighter isotopes to the
<BR>
point where you wind up with low grade uranium, strontium, etc. which is
<BR>
reprocessed to get the radioactive isotopes for more fissioning, and the
<BR>
non-reactive isotopes can then be used in industry or disposed of. I
<BR>
could type up a big paper on it, but you would be better to find
<BR>
something that is already on the net with regard to the breeder reaction
<BR>
cycle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Thats why France has nowhere near the waste problem we do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They may not have the political problem that the USA has as to where to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permanently store highly radioactive material but that has nothing to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>They have far more greens than we do, but they are educated greens, who
<BR>
prefer nukes that burn their own waste to smog and adding to the carbon
<BR>
dioxide levels.

<EM>&gt;     &gt; Plutonium in the IFR would never leave the containment.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Read up on it John. I'm actually surprised that you are not aware of
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;High level wastes were blanketed around the reactor to absorb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;stray neutrons, thereby speeding their decay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How is that going to work? OK, a neutron might turn a cobalt 60
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atom into a harmless isotope of nickel but a neutron could also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; turn U238 into plutonium or cause U235 to fission and produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more cobalt 60, or turn common potassium into potassium 40.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but you reprocess the waste to extract the remaining radioactive
<BR>
isotopes for more fissioning, and the non-radioactive isotopes can be
<BR>
used by industry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; World stocks of Pu are a rich source of power. They are not a liability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; unless they are NOT burned in power plants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Getting rid of weapons grade plutonium in power plants might be a good idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but you don't need a breeder for that.
</EM><BR>
<P>You do if you don't want more waste than you started with. The only
<BR>
plants we have here in the US for getting rid of our weapons grade
<BR>
plutonium are, in fact, breeder reactors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; The problem here in the US is that the anti-nuke crowd refuses to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; reprocessing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thousands of tons of plutonium exist on the earth and more is made every day,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but most of it is mixed in with other extremely lethal radioactive waste so it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very hard to work with without separating it out in a chemical reprocessing plant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It only takes a few pounds to make a bomb so I want it hard to work with, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want a reprocessing plant.
</EM><BR>
<P>The reprocessing plants are contained and typically automated with
<BR>
remote pickups.
