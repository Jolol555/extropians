<P>How do you protect a computer from what Joe and

Mike are doing?  More seriously, what constitutes 
<BR>
&quot;misuse?&quot;  The techniques of spammers, used for 
<BR>
broadcasting public-safety messages?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the wrong hands) harm people.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Should be.  But in the real world Freya always overlooks 
<BR>
the mistletoe, Loki is always re-elected, Baldur always
<BR>
dies.  Behind every red-padlocked launch button is a 
<BR>
morlock like me with a schematic and a screwdriver.  
<BR>
In the newer electrically-fired guns coming on the market 
<BR>
now, the &quot;lock&quot; will seek to ground the detonater contact. 
<BR>
Open that ground and you're free to fire.  In the older 
<BR>
system, safety is accomplished by interfering with the 
<BR>
application of a blow to the primer. The owner-recognition 
<BR>
system, necessarily electrical for the foreseeable future, 
<BR>
will interface with the mechanical train through some 
<BR>
piezo- or magneto-strictive device.  Find that widget, 
<BR>
block it, you're free to fire.
<BR>
<P>Weapons - tools that kill men or beasts - appear to me 
<BR>
to be an integral component of humanity as presently 
<BR>
constituted.  To seek to transform yourself into a being 
<BR>
who (that?) has transcended the need to kill to live, 
<BR>
seems to me to be shiningly extropian.  To seek to 
<BR>
transform others, excepting always those over whom you 
<BR>
have authority commensurate with your responsibility 
<BR>
for them, does not seem to be extropian.
<BR>
<P>Focus on the front sight.
