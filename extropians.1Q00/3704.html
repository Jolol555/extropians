<P>{8^D  Coward?  Perhaps, but I in fact do not try to memorize
<BR>
who believes what, and I dont archive the extropian traffic.  I
<BR>
*think* Eliezer is one of those who believes the world will be
<BR>
really radically different in 5 yrs than it is now, but not sure.  This
<BR>
worries me because he is one of those who might be able to
<BR>
actually *cause* a radical difference.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, I am sensitized to people's wish for privacy, and
<BR>
I dont recall who those folks are, so common courtesy dictates
<BR>
not naming names when in doubt.  {8-]  I dont suspect Eliezer
<BR>
minds being associated with the 5-10 yrs crowd.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Im pretty sure it is longer than that, 20-30 for instance, before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we have the tech to theoretically extend life out to 150 yrs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It only matters to someone 120+ now, whether or not we will have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology to hit 150 in 20-30 years.
</EM><BR>
<P>No no, Robert, we need a new way to think about this.  Weve painted
<BR>
ourselves into a corner.  Consider this:  you and I are about 40, so
<BR>
the probability that one of us will die this year is, say  0.02, but next
<BR>
year it will be slightly higher, say 0.021, and higher the next year
<BR>
and so on.  If we wanted to look up life insurance rates, we could
<BR>
actually calc these numbers.
<BR>
<P>Now, if that leukemia cure that was announced in November turns
<BR>
out to be a robust cure for all leukemia, then *everyone's* risk of
<BR>
death goes down.
<BR>
<P>My question now can be stated thus: at what time in the future do
<BR>
we hit the point where our chance of perishing next year is the
<BR>
same as it was this year?  Does it not follow then that a few years
<BR>
after that point, then our chance of croaking next year is actually
<BR>
lower than it was this year?  Does not this point come sooner
<BR>
for the currently young than for the currently old? [like us.  {8^D]
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, we can reach this point and still not be immortal,
<BR>
because even if our risk of death is going down with time,
<BR>
it is nonzero, so we are still accumulating risk.
<BR>
<P>I know not this topic, but I am confident this has already been
<BR>
thought out and thoroughly documented.  But where?  spike
