Umm like nudity in Queensland? Or perhaps you mean the fact the the internet

is censored here? or was it last weeks banning of Romance, a movie freely

shown in America as well as Europe?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Can't be certain, but I'm fairly sure

<EM> &gt; you could stroll in a swimsuit or a feathered chickensuit or a giant

<EM> &gt; plastic pizza from the Yarra River to the middle of Melbourne without being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; molested by police

though you might be shot dead if you have schizophrenia? Or are a foreign

<P><P>This is largely off topic, but let's at least be honest: Australia has no

respect for individual liberty. Senator Alston and Prime Minister Howard

have repeatedly made exactly this claim, noting explicitly that this is not
<BR>
America and &quot;we&quot; (most Australians) are happy to have laws restricting
<BR>
individual liberty. I guess &quot;we&quot; are into the &quot;M&quot; side of S&amp;M?
<BR>
<P>So, be happy to live in Australia if you are, but no need to claim that we
<BR>
have more freedom here. We don't.

In which case you may be shot dead.

Or if you are carrying a pair of kitchen scissors in New South Wales you can
<BR>
go to jail for 14 years.
