<EM>&gt; Well, yeah, but compare this to Keith Henson's talk of changing the

<EM>&gt; solar sails around it...

<P>Hey, thats pretty much what an MBrain is.  If we don't have any
<BR>
materials shortages (I'm kinda worried about copper or niobium for
<BR>
the SC coils on the Mass drivers).  Then we can build a first
<BR>
approximation MBrain out of Mercury in only a few weeks.  The
<BR>
interesting part of MBrain subunits is whether or not you could
<BR>
make them light enough to station/orbit manage via sail methods
<BR>
or whether they will be so heavy (all that coolant circulating...)
<BR>
that you have to use some inter-node diamond tension cables or
<BR>
even vector jets to keep the nodes from running into one another.
<BR>
You have to keep in mind that in order to maximize energy collection
<BR>
and radiator surface area you want the nodes orbiting &quot;virtually&quot;
<BR>
edge-to-edge.  I don't believe the responses required to deal with
<BR>
pressures generated by solar flares will be trivial (at least if the
<BR>
subunits are relatively &quot;light&quot;).
<BR>
<P>Since one of the best ways to dismantle Mercury involves lots of Mass
<BR>
Drivers, you are going to have the technology to despin, reorient and
<BR>
cool JBrains, if you want to go that route.  I do think the issues of
<BR>
heat transfer from the JBrain to your coolant stream are being *glossed
<BR>
over* however.  Its one thing to say its an engineering problem, its
<BR>
another to avoid discussing the existing principles of physics on which
<BR>
the engineering should be based.  There is a fine line between creative
<BR>
astroengineering and magic physics and one has to be careful not to cross it.
