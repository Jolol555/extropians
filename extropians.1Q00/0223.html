( very much snipped)
<BR>
&lt;&lt;Tolerance and acceptance of other's views is an adult
<BR>
way to be in the world.&gt;&gt; 
<BR>
&lt;Collaborative brainstorming&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;  The
<BR>
&nbsp;tensions are lighter, most people go into a collaborative situation with an
<BR>
&nbsp;even sensibility rather than a one-uppersonship &gt;&gt;
<BR>
(snip again)
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Both types of environments can be beneficial to dealing with problems and
<BR>
&nbsp;situations where transhuman ideas are put down or attacked. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>I LIKED this post, because it addressed two ways of putting ideas across. 
<BR>
Replacing argument with wisdom, instilling a a desire to learn. Likewise 
<BR>
Natasha's websites: they provide - not only substance, and lots of it - but a 
<BR>
way to *engage* and *delight* people with your ideas. Creating a safe place 
<BR>
for them to *try on* these ideas ... but never to &quot;win&quot; them over in a 
<BR>
battle. 
<BR>
<P>People do not debate with me -- I hate it. Anyway... usually they are 
<BR>
hotshots who already have a point to prove. 
<BR>
You see, in my world, it's rude. There are places where that is appropriate. 
<BR>
I am not an academic, nor a philosopher. I am a Muse. 
<BR>
I inspire, move, instill ..I engage people with creativity and ideas. We love 
<BR>
and delight and tickle each other with ideas, we're not into butting antlers. 
<BR>
<P>Where do I espouse my views on life-extension, technology and optimism? Where 
<BR>
do so many of us find ourselves doing so? !!!!!iii!! In a social context*. 
<BR>
If I suddenly begin a &quot;debate&quot;, trying to convince or cajole, won't the 
<BR>
lovely guests flee in haste, to a more pleasant corner of the room? 
<BR>
<P>Sometimes I notice at parties people who walk the room, looking for a victim 
<BR>
to try on their ideas with. This is distasteful. Especially if it becomes a 
<BR>
debate. 
<BR>
<P>So the tools for getting memes across become: tolerance, good listening, a 
<BR>
likely demeanor, *humor*, lively engagement, education, pleasant repartee, 
<BR>
and the accouterments of social skills. I repeat, good social skills!
<BR>
<P>Many people do not realize that half of the problem isn't the ideas, or the 
<BR>
way the *ideas* are presented, it's the way they present *themselves*. 
<BR>

<P><P>**parties, events,gatherings, dates, evenings with friends, concerts, art 
<BR>
shows, etc.
