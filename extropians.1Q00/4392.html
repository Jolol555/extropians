<EM>&gt; I expect that, if there is intelligent intervention, it is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; omnipotent.  I think what we observe is a work in progress.  Suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a natural product of our evolution.  
</EM><BR>
<P>If superintelligences do exist, we could easily be the subject of
<BR>
an experiment, or simply be left to our own devices for the sake of
<BR>
promoting diversity.  As SIs would be much older than us, they
<BR>
would have had much longer to explore the phase space of possible
<BR>
architectures &amp; purposes and would have witnessed almost everything
<BR>
(good and bad).
<BR>
<P>If there is &quot;active&quot; intervention, then they are tuning things
<BR>
to suit the criteria of the experiment.  If there is no active
<BR>
intervention, it is because that is what is &quot;best&quot;.  They may
<BR>
be unable to prove they have explored all of the phase spaces
<BR>
for existence, and so the best possible thing to do is to not
<BR>
interfere with developing civilizations that might discover
<BR>
an alternate path (assuming the phase spaces are like Godel's
<BR>
mathematical systems).
<BR>
<P>There is no good/bad/luck/suffering!  Its only your perception
<BR>
of specific circumstances in the context of a system that either
<BR>
has no purpose whatsoever or a purpose whose potential benefits
<BR>
far exceeds any costs that might be imposed on any sub-sub-SIs.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 questions for discussion:  If pain and suffering did not exist, might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complacency keep us from creating?
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  Why do you think suffering promotes creation?  While I'm sure there
<BR>
are &quot;suffering&quot; artists, there are those that are &quot;joyful&quot; as well.
<BR>
A better questions would be whether the *really* creative are such
<BR>
odd mental mixes (perhaps primarily genetic) that they are borderline
<BR>
for survival? The mathematician Erdos being a case that comes to mind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Secondly, HOW MUCH pain and suffering would be the minimum that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent species would need, to be motivated to create?
</EM><BR>
<P>If we assume Dolphins are intelligent, they rarely have experiences
<BR>
involving &quot;pain and suffering&quot; (most commonly accidentally imposed
<BR>
by humans in one way or another), yet they would appear to be a
<BR>
very creative species.  I think intelligent species create for
<BR>
entertainment.

<EM>&gt; &gt; So much of what I see in the world enrages me.  When I study history I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; horrified by all the ignorance, poverty, war and disease that devastated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; families and nations.  Some of it people knowingly brought upon themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but much of it was out of their control.  And right as of this moment in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time, to a great extent these evils still exist and inflict grievous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suffering on countless millions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem here is saying that &quot;shit happening&quot; is in some way &quot;evil&quot;.
<BR>
If an 10 km asteroid strikes the Earth tomorrow and sets us back a couple
<BR>
of millennia, are you going to claim that it is *evil*???  Further, if
<BR>
you invoke the desirability of a warm &amp; cosy environment, you may be
<BR>
constructing a recipe for us ending up like dolphins!!  We would be
<BR>
well fed, happy and masters of our environment *and* limited in our
<BR>
abilities to shape the world around us.  The dolphins, if they do
<BR>
not evolve, are doomed to a lot of suffering in a billion or so
<BR>
years when the oceans start evaporating.  Could it be that the suffering
<BR>
is what creates the curiosity that drives us to develop technologies
<BR>
that shape the world and eventually reach for the stars?  As the
<BR>
saying goes, &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Take the fundamental &quot;evil&quot; of death itself -- Nature (and other
<BR>
species) cannot evolve out of this box without creating conscious
<BR>
intelligence that develops the ability to control its hardware.
<BR>
[This is because long-lived individuals are either (a) always out
<BR>
reproduced by their shorter-lived cousins, or (b) must continue
<BR>
to produce ever-increasing quantities of offspring to maintain
<BR>
the long-living fraction of the total gene pool which eventually
<BR>
leads to resource exhaustion, a population collapse and possible
<BR>
extinction.]  Those species that do not &quot;suffer&quot; enough to
<BR>
develop consciousness and the means for self-modification, never
<BR>
escape from this trap.
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing about being an extropian/transhumanist in
<BR>
these times, is that we will have the possibility of uplifting(?)
<BR>
or downloading you into a dolphin-creature at some point.  I look
<BR>
forward to the nightly reports on the advantages and disadvantages
<BR>
of that existence, particularly after you have explained to them
<BR>
that their existence is doomed.
