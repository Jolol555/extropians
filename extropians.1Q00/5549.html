<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't doubt that complex organisms capable of surviving such

<EM>&gt; environments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are possible, but I have some reservations about the idea that they could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; evolve locally. Before you can have organisms with lots of elaborate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; adaptations for surviving extreme environmental swings, you have to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simple organisms that don't have such adaptations.  You need an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in which life can arise, solve the basic survival problems like energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; production and reproduction, and reach a level of complexity that allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complex adaptations to evolve.  That implies that a world that has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; period followed by wild climate swings may support interesting life, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that has always had extreme shifts may not evolve life in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I agree with what Billy is saying here for the most part, Earth is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as tame as some might think.  Even now, some climatists have proposed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Earth has completely frozen over several times in its history and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rapid climate change followed by stable periods might be the rule.  (See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; by Paul F. Hoffman and Daniel P. Schrag in _Scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American_ 2000 Jan for the former (now at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html">http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html</A>) and &quot;Rapid Climate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Change&quot; by Kendrick Taylor in _American Scientist_ 1999 July-August.)  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is by no means like a highly elliptical orbiting planet scenario, say, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Poul Anderson's _A Circus of Hells_, or the OnOff Star scenario in Vernor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vinge's _A Deepness in the Sky_, but it should give one pause.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the basis of the earth's deep freeze occilations were due to
<BR>
the travels of the continents. With most continental areas on the
<BR>
equator and periods of heavy vulcanism, such periods were a natural
<BR>
consequence. During this period, antarctica was not at the south pole,
<BR>
so it was not sequestering 3/4+ of the ice on the planet. No land locked
<BR>
ice cap meant sea levels 200 meters higher than they are now. Higher
<BR>
pressure at the bottom of the ocean allowed greater sequestration of
<BR>
methane hydrates under the ocean floors, and thus less methane in the
<BR>
atmosphere(methane is about 6x more effective as a greenhouse gas) The
<BR>
loss of methane causes a cooldown, increases in ocean ice caps, and
<BR>
glacial buildup, the vulcanism of the newly spreading continents kept
<BR>
the dust levels high. The CO2 concentrations and global climate
<BR>
temperature are linked only by a log relationship, such that CO2
<BR>
concentrations variances at low levels have wide impact on temperature
<BR>
fluctuations, but as concentrations increase, this effect falls off.
<BR>
According to my geologist cousin, essentially if we dropped the
<BR>
atmospheric CO2 levels by 50%, we'd drop global temps by 20-30 degrees,
<BR>
while if we increase them by 50% from the current levels, global temps
<BR>
will go up by less than 5 degrees.
<BR>
<P>According to Drew, the antarctic ice cap (the large one, not the small
<BR>
one on the coast) is stable over the long term, and its been that way
<BR>
since the last major extinction/possible impact period of 22 million
<BR>
years ago. The winds flow outward from the cap (the catabatic winds),
<BR>
and are replenished from cold upper atmospheric air that drops down from
<BR>
high altitudes (and the higher altitudes are cooling down while the
<BR>
surface levels of temperate climates is warming up.) The Greenland ice
<BR>
cap may collapse, and the arctic ice cap will most likely vanish in a
<BR>
few decades. If the Greenland ice cap collapses, it will result in sea
<BR>
level rises of 3-9 meters at most. If only the arctic ice cap melts
<BR>
away, there will be little or no sea level changes, because that ice is
<BR>
already floating in the water. Any rise will simply be due to thermal
<BR>
expansion of the oceans.
