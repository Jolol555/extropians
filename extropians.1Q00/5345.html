<EM>&gt; the police/national guard against the millions of legally armed folks in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US with their hunting rifles and pistols, my money would be on the poorly

Well normally I would too but in this case the poorly armed masses have no
<BR>
access to AWACS and it's brothers or the spy sat net or remote pilotless recon.
<BR>
There may be a few thousand night vision equipped survivalists but not your
<BR>
average Joe. Ammunition would be in short supply...surely to be targeted first
<BR>
by ugly big brother. I think the only hope is the fact that I doubt the
<BR>
Army/National guard would ever attack US citizens. They ARE US citizens after
<BR>
all and their families would be at risk. If some wacko General tried to pull
<BR>
something I'd look to see the military mutiny en masse.
<BR>
<P>I don't wish to challenge what your analogy was for just the analogy. I too
<BR>
believe in the power of interconnected computing and I am a part of SETI via the
<BR>
SETI@home project. Cheers! :)
