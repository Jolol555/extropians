<EM>&gt; &gt;  From today's &quot;Salon&quot; newsfeed:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The right stuff for the Red Planet: At 35, Dava Newman's an MIT engineer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people promoting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place due to it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity? Don't get me wrong I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us to go there and I feel we could live there. I believe, though, we can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live there under a man made roof to hold in the atmosphere. I asked R. Zubrin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this question. All he said was go read his book. Geez, was a straight answer so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult? Perhaps he's only in it for the money as he was more interested in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buying his book than answering a question that couldn't have taken but a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There are good reasons why:
<BR>
a) it took at least a few hundred million years for Mars to become
<BR>
uninhabitable. Plenty of time to found and refound many civilizations if
<BR>
we start the process over again.
<BR>
b) the original state did not have an intelligent race (us) to maintain
<BR>
and keep it habitable.
<BR>
c) the original atmosphere did not have a few guided comets helping to
<BR>
get to a high enough pressure level to sustain a greenhouse effect.
<BR>
d) the atmosphere is still there, its just locked in the rocks and under
<BR>
the surface. If a moon like Titan, which is smaller than Mars, can have
<BR>
a denser atmosphere, while being around five times farther away from the
<BR>
sun than Mars, then its possible to do the same with Mars. 
<BR>
<P>Zubrin's research suggests that there is enough CO2, O2, and nitrogen
<BR>
locked away in the rocks and ice to create an atmosphere somewhere
<BR>
between 300-800 millibars. Adding a few comets at the north pole should
<BR>
add enough more energy and gases to boost the levels up to earth normal.
<BR>
Then its just a matter of introducing plant/algae species to convert CO2
<BR>
to O2, while building huge aerosol and methane manufacturing and
<BR>
evaporating plants to boost the greenhouse effect.
<BR>
<P>It would take a few hundred years to get an earthlike world, but a
<BR>
livable world could be had in several decades, if the data is right and
<BR>
people invest with a vengance. Its not a matter of CAN it be done, but
<BR>
do we WANT to do it? I do.
