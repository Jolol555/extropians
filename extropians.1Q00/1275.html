<P>OK, I want to transcend my biological limitations just as much as you do.  I'm 
<BR>
planning on doing this transceding by means of using also my brains as 
<BR>
one of the 'force' that control me rather letting myself be controlled *only* 
<BR>
by hard-wired 'biological' imperatives. 
<BR>
<P>But I want the 'memes' in my brain to be selfish too -- in the sense that they 
<BR>
further the well-being of the machine { brain + body }.  I do not very much 
<BR>
want large conflicts between what my biological urges tell me that's good for 
<BR>
my body (for my genes) and what my memes instruct me to do in the interest of 
<BR>
those memes themselves; I want some form of cooperation between these two 
<BR>
driving forces.  Neither the survival of my memes nor the survival of my
<BR>
genes is the only goal: the goal is the survival and growth of the amalgam 
<BR>
{ brain + body }.  [And also + its artificial extensions and + its 
<BR>
'extended phenotype'.] 
<BR>
So I want the compromise between the 'biological' imperatives and the 
<BR>
'memetic' imperatives to lie somewhere in the middle where the ''selfish'' 
<BR>
interests of this thing I call ''me'' ( = the amalgam { brain + body } ) are 
<BR>
best served. 
<BR>
<P>In that way, the thing I call ''me'' really *is* selfish: it only strives to 
<BR>
further its own interests, not e.g. those of other intelligent entities also 
<BR>
consisting of agglomerations of a { brain + body }.  However, this does not 
<BR>
say that in very many cases the best way to achieve those selfish ends is to 
<BR>
*cooperate with* rather than to fight other people/entities.  But seeing that 
<BR>
one is selfish helps one (I think) to see more clearly which kinds of 
<BR>
cooperations are most useful to oneself. 
<BR>
<P>Best greetings,   Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20Selfishness%20(Was:%20Re:%20Polemics%20for%20longevity)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000123133736.579B-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
