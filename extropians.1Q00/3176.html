On the topic of being kicked out of my confirmation class, it wasn't just 
<BR>
me, just a few weeks prior, my good friend got kicked out because he was 
<BR>
wearing a Bad Religion shirt.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Such rebels!  Had your religious instructors really cared they could have 
<BR>
handled all these things, even if it meant sometimes saying, &quot;I don't know&quot; 
<BR>
and putting up with a little attitude.  In my confirmation class all we did 
<BR>
was draw and get all the soda we could drink!  The father seemed a little 
<BR>
ethereal to me.
<BR>
<P>I attended a Unitarian church for a short time to write a paper on them for 
<BR>
a sociology of religion class and found it an interesting experience.  It 
<BR>
was an odd demographic, older married couples with lots of young children.  
<BR>
Almost no teens and young adults!  The pastor had a doctorate in history and 
<BR>
a master's in divinity.  A very nice man who struggled in a small and 
<BR>
somewhat austere church building and rectory.
<BR>
<P>While serving in a missionary endeavor outside an army base about a decade 
<BR>
ago, I bought at an army/navy surplus store a t-shirt for my mildly 
<BR>
rebellious fifteen year-old brother.  He liked to wear shirts from heavy 
<BR>
metal bands so I thought I would send him something better that was 
<BR>
&quot;patriotic.&quot;  The shirt had on it a picture of flaming skulls wearing 
<BR>
helmets and with the words, &quot;We will fight to hell and back!&quot;
<BR>
<P>I should have known my brother would go to a church youth group wearing it!  
<BR>
When the most self-important and obnoxious member of the congregation 
<BR>
confronted him about it he said, &quot;my missionary brother gave this to me!&quot;  
<BR>
The guy shut up and walked away.  My younger brother loved that t-shirt! lol
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
