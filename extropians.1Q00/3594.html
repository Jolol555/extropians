<P>&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Is there any reason, short of Mr Lorrey's hypothesized assault on
<BR>
&nbsp;rationalism, not to
<BR>
&nbsp;refer to these other &quot;intelligences&quot; as what they *are*: abilities. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>For the five-millionth time, yes. YES!! There IS a reason... drum roll 
<BR>
please... and ..... The reason is, (yawn, getting tired of beating the poor 
<BR>
dead horsey) that it is useful. It addresses teaching children who are not 
<BR>
normally classified as intelligent by the standards the old school educators 
<BR>
and pshycologists cling to. Research shows that when exposed to ideas through 
<BR>
different channels, students have shown remarkable aptitude for subjects that 
<BR>
they previously did not do well in.
<BR>
<P>By the way, Binet is by no means the last (or latest) word on the subject, he 
<BR>
WAS a pioneer in 1905, but YEARS ago,  IQ testing did not withstand close 
<BR>
scrutiny, in fact this scrutiny has been helpful in creating many new tests 
<BR>
for intelligence including new ones for reasoning and cognitive abilities.
<BR>
<P>At least you studied it, and possibly Piaget, which at least gives your 
<BR>
answer SOME credibility. Piaget recognized that teaching needed to focus on 
<BR>
how children were reasoning rather than focusing on how well they might 
<BR>
recall facts for a test.
<BR>
Nevertheless, while his work is lauded by most researchers, it has had little 
<BR>
effect on the school system. Gardner's work has had great impact.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;  What is so wrong with the word
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;ability&quot;, or
<BR>
&nbsp;so exalted with the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, that we feel the need to redefine
<BR>
&nbsp;abilities as
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;intelligence&quot;, so as not to cast aspersions on them? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>It is not a matter of politically correct, or exaltation of abilities. What 
<BR>
you think of it is ultimately not an issue. It is, quite simply, and 
<BR>
repeatedly, an educational tool. 
<BR>
<P>The reason for redefining this particular value is the same reason those 
<BR>
upstartAyn Rand followers constantly and compulsively redefine the term 
<BR>
selfish. It is to make use of it in a positive light. 
<BR>
The End.
