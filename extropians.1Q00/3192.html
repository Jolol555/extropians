<P><EM>&gt; I know the general consensus is that GM food is OK.  But the same thing

was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thought about such things as cigarette smoking, silicone breasts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thalydomide (sp?) once upon a time.  Sure maybe GM stuff is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harmless, but my goal is long life.  I ain't taking any chances ;)

<P>Actually, people have suspected that smoking was bad for you ever since
<BR>
Europeans discovered tobacco.  It just took a long time for medical science
<BR>
to reach the point where it was capable of deciding the issue in a
<BR>
convincing, scientific manner.
<BR>
<P>Now, it the case of GM foods, medical science is already perfectly capable
<BR>
of addressing the question of its safety.  There isn't anything going on
<BR>
here that we haven't been dealing with for years in drug safety testing.
<BR>
Therefore, we have no more reason to be suspicious of GM foods than we do of
<BR>
a new pharmaceutical.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I'm all in favor of letting people make their own decisions.  By
<BR>
all means, let us make sure that people who are worried about GM foods can
<BR>
avoid them - but let us also make sure that those of us who aren't worried
<BR>
can take advantage of their benefits.
