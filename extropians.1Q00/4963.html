Bingo for Charlie on this one. Journalists and scientists and politicians 
<BR>
were for 30 years pimping the idea of nuclear energy.  As Freeman Dyson had 
<BR>
pointed out, had the slow route been taken, there would have likely, been a 
<BR>
slow, incremental, development towards robust fission reactions and power 
<BR>
sources. This may never have lead to military apps; that is, principally, 
<BR>
bombs and radiological weapons.  The Boiling Water Reactors and the 
<BR>
Pressurized Water reactors are and were not the apotheosis of nuclear 
<BR>
technology's potential. That failure has, as Charlie pointed out, the use of 
<BR>
natural gas powered turbines to fill the gap in electricity use world-wide Oh 
<BR>
well.
