My personal taste bends more toward the Moog sound.  My favourite band is
<BR>
Stereolab, which I recently had the pleasure of seeing play live.  Their
<BR>
mish-mosh of french and english lyrics singing socialist refrains leaves a
<BR>
smile on my face.
<BR>
<P>Tortoise, on the other hand uses such &quot;hackneyed&quot; sets of instruments in a
<BR>
most unique way - and as I pointed out earlier this year, have extropian
<BR>
undertones - as found in their cd &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die...&quot;
<BR>
<P>As I've recently signed up for cable television service for the very first
<BR>
time, and seeing the things on MTV and VH1 - I can more appreciate the
<BR>
minimalistic and overall laconic lyrics of my long-term favorites.
<BR>
<P>As found at <A HREF="http://www.blakedesign.com/stereolab">http://www.blakedesign.com/stereolab</A> here are some of their
<BR>
lyrics for you to enjoy:
<BR>
<P>from anonymous collective:
<BR>
&quot;you and me are moulded by things well beyond our acknowledgement&quot;
<BR>
<P>from come and play in the milky night:
<BR>
&quot;led astray / before the fragile defense of words / come and play / bring
<BR>
the stars / play in the milky night&quot;
<BR>
<P>from extension trip (english translation):
<BR>
&quot;biological constitution / at the time rigid and plastic / of which the
<BR>
flexibility loses its place to the critical faculties / of which the
<BR>
flexibility loses its place to a nice large perspective&quot;
<BR>
<P>from the free design:
<BR>
&quot;where it had been left / hunderds of years ago / extract from the depth /
<BR>
is but a setting sun / paradise is scarce / in this light that won't shine /
<BR>
what is our earthly task / but a worthy design?&quot;
<BR>
<P>from infinity girl:
<BR>
&quot;new realities are conditions much to little for us to suffer / because we
<BR>
don't know any better / there are a hundred ways to fall in step... because
<BR>
for the past two hundred years the wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed...
<BR>
o are dubious and laughable / waiting to yield a new use of life / scatter,
<BR>
scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence / a knife to cut the root, the
<BR>
root of ignorance&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Of course, to fully enjoy, you'll need to hear the angelic voice singing
<BR>
them....
<BR>
<P><P>-christopher.

<EM>&gt;I agree, and it goes for traditional instruments too. How many times have I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heard Ben Fold's Five playing, for instance, and thought to myself &quot;jeez,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's just a plain old piano he's playing. How mediocre&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extremely beg to differ.  For the past few years I have split my
<BR>
compositions between multi-track pieces and solo piano pieces; the textures
<BR>
and timbres of a 'plain old piano' are as yet unrivalled by anything
<BR>
digital.
<BR>
In fact, with all due respect to the latest in music technology, some of
<BR>
the most unique keyboard instruments such as Mellotrons, Moogs, Hammond
<BR>
Organs and many other 'older' instruments are analog, and extremely hard
<BR>
(if not, perhaps, impossible) to emulate fully on a digital synth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, there is room for both analog and digital...it is simply
<BR>
a
<BR>
matter of taste.
