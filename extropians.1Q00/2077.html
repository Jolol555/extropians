<EM>&gt; Sometimes I get the feeling that you guys are really that interested in
</EM><BR>
life-extension,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;because I'm not hearing any real plans for finding ways to help promote
</EM><BR>
research
<BR>
<EM>&gt;or real scientific ideas in this area. In a way, that scares me, because
</EM><BR>
I'm pretty
<BR>
<EM>&gt;sure that all are the only ones vocal enough to have started caring about
</EM><BR>
it in the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a few points to be made here.
<BR>
<P>First, what are _you_ doing to make it happen?  Are you practicing life
<BR>
extension therapies now?  Do you maintain an optimal lifestyle?  Are you
<BR>
doing anything to promote life extension research?  If not, consider
<BR>
starting with yourself -- rather than whining about people on the list.
<BR>
<P>Second, not all of us here are research scientists, marketing experts, or
<BR>
wealthy with extra cash to startup biotech companies.  So, don't blame
<BR>
anyone on this list if they are not your wet dream of a transhuman.
<BR>
<P>Third, some research is being done right now.  E.g., the Life Extension
<BR>
Foundation www.lef.org funds such research.  You can join it and donate
<BR>
money to it if you want.  There are also many other people and organizations
<BR>
working along the same lines.  Don't think you have to be Extropian or
<BR>
transhumanist to want to live longer and not age.  I think that's pretty
<BR>
universal, given that aging Chinese men pay loads of money for rhino horn
<BR>
powder to rejuvenate themselves.  (This is not a good therapy, but my point
<BR>
is the demand for life extension and antiaging therapies is there.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; OR, as my boss has said repeatedly--&quot;don't confuse effort and results&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are we just so much mush--sitting around and telling each other how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great transhumanism is? Or are we going to do something to actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help our misguided human brethren to figure out that they don't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;die after 50 or 70 years like everybody has up until then. Our motto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be, &quot;Be unique--live indefinitely!&quot; Or something...
</EM><BR>
<P>Start with yourself.  What do you do to live longer and healthier?
<BR>
<P>BTW, everyone is already unique.  Uniqueness in itself is not enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wrote to the whitehouse today (you can get there from
</EM><BR>
www.whitehouse.gov)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and asked Al and Tipper to de-regulate biotech when he takes office, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he probably will--because I'm just not seeing the progress from George W.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess we'll have to wait until November to find out, but while I admire
<BR>
your effort, I think it won't have much effect.
