<P>I apologize.  When I was referring to creativity, I wasn't thinking only
<BR>
of art.  I expect that suffering, though not the only, nor even best

motivator, has lead us to create solutions.  You made my point more
<BR>
effectively.  Thanks.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I expect that, if there is intelligent intervention, it is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; omnipotent.  I think what we observe is a work in progress.  Suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a natural product of our evolution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If superintelligences do exist, we could easily be the subject of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an experiment, or simply be left to our own devices for the sake of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promoting diversity.  As SIs would be much older than us, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have had much longer to explore the phase space of possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architectures &amp; purposes and would have witnessed almost everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (good and bad).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there is &quot;active&quot; intervention, then they are tuning things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to suit the criteria of the experiment.  If there is no active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervention, it is because that is what is &quot;best&quot;.  They may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be unable to prove they have explored all of the phase spaces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for existence, and so the best possible thing to do is to not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfere with developing civilizations that might discover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an alternate path (assuming the phase spaces are like Godel's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mathematical systems).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is no good/bad/luck/suffering!  Its only your perception
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of specific circumstances in the context of a system that either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has no purpose whatsoever or a purpose whose potential benefits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far exceeds any costs that might be imposed on any sub-sub-SIs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2 questions for discussion:  If pain and suffering did not exist, might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complacency keep us from creating?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh?  Why do you think suffering promotes creation?  While I'm sure there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are &quot;suffering&quot; artists, there are those that are &quot;joyful&quot; as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A better questions would be whether the *really* creative are such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; odd mental mixes (perhaps primarily genetic) that they are borderline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for survival? The mathematician Erdos being a case that comes to mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly, HOW MUCH pain and suffering would be the minimum that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligent species would need, to be motivated to create?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we assume Dolphins are intelligent, they rarely have experiences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involving &quot;pain and suffering&quot; (most commonly accidentally imposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by humans in one way or another), yet they would appear to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very creative species.  I think intelligent species create for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entertainment.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So much of what I see in the world enrages me.  When I study history I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; horrified by all the ignorance, poverty, war and disease that devastated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; families and nations.  Some of it people knowingly brought upon themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; but much of it was out of their control.  And right as of this moment in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; time, to a great extent these evils still exist and inflict grievous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering on countless millions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the problem here is saying that &quot;shit happening&quot; is in some way &quot;evil&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If an 10 km asteroid strikes the Earth tomorrow and sets us back a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of millennia, are you going to claim that it is *evil*???  Further, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you invoke the desirability of a warm &amp; cosy environment, you may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructing a recipe for us ending up like dolphins!!  We would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well fed, happy and masters of our environment *and* limited in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abilities to shape the world around us.  The dolphins, if they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not evolve, are doomed to a lot of suffering in a billion or so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years when the oceans start evaporating.  Could it be that the suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is what creates the curiosity that drives us to develop technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that shape the world and eventually reach for the stars?  As the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying goes, &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take the fundamental &quot;evil&quot; of death itself -- Nature (and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species) cannot evolve out of this box without creating conscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence that develops the ability to control its hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [This is because long-lived individuals are either (a) always out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduced by their shorter-lived cousins, or (b) must continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to produce ever-increasing quantities of offspring to maintain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the long-living fraction of the total gene pool which eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads to resource exhaustion, a population collapse and possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extinction.]  Those species that do not &quot;suffer&quot; enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop consciousness and the means for self-modification, never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escape from this trap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The interesting thing about being an extropian/transhumanist in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these times, is that we will have the possibility of uplifting(?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or downloading you into a dolphin-creature at some point.  I look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward to the nightly reports on the advantages and disadvantages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that existence, particularly after you have explained to them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that their existence is doomed.
