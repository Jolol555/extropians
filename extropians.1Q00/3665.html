<P><P>&quot;Intelligence&quot; is a word. It is a symbol we use use to refer, in speech and
<BR>
writing, to a particular class of mental abilities. The &quot;traditional&quot;
<BR>
definition is that &quot;intelligence&quot; is one's ability in those areas of
<BR>
cognition also referred to as &quot;mathematical / verbal abstract symbolic
<BR>
reasoning.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I have no particular attachment to the word &quot;intelligence&quot;. In fact, I am
<BR>
prepared to jettison it altogether if it will aid communication.
<BR>
Intelligence being the word it is, and having the history of usage it does
<BR>
and the connotations it does, communication is better served by abandoning
<BR>
the word altogether, then by weakening it's definition from a particular
<BR>
subset of our cognitive abilities, into a mere synonym for &quot;cognitive
<BR>
ability&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Intelligence&quot; does not mean the same thing  as &quot;cognitive ability.&quot;
<BR>
Intelligence has never meant anything more then &quot;one's ability at
<BR>
mathematical / verbal abstract symbolic reasoning, as compared to one's
<BR>
peers abilities in this area.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Note that at NO time in this argument have I even *suggested* that
<BR>
&quot;intelligence&quot; is the entire sum of human cognition, or indeed even the most
<BR>
important part. Intelligence is a part of cognition. It may be characterized
<BR>
as a cognitive ability, one among many. That it has it's own particular noun
<BR>
is an accident of history, and largely due to the gross misinterpretation by
<BR>
American psychologists of Binet's work. It even may turn out that
<BR>
intelligence qua intelligence is next to useless in the creation of
<BR>
artificial minds.
<BR>
<P>The human mind has a vast array of completely different abilities, each of
<BR>
which makes it's own contribution to that total, which may most accurately
<BR>
be referred to as &quot;cognition.&quot; Intelligence is one of these abilities. It is
<BR>
NOT the only one. It MAY not be the most important one. But it IS *merely*
<BR>
an ability. As are all of the other abilities that Gardner has characterized
<BR>
as &quot;intelligences.&quot; They are not forms of intelligence. They are abilities.
<BR>
Intelligence is an ability. Gardner seems to feel the two words are
<BR>
synonyms. They are not.
<BR>
<P>As to Mr. Lorrey's contention, it is true that the cognitive ability of
<BR>
mathematical/verbal abstract symbolic reasoning has never been more useful
<BR>
in society then it is today. For some reason, however, it has never been
<BR>
more out of style (or &quot;politically incorrect&quot;) among academic circles as it
<BR>
is today. It is my belief that Gardner's incorrect use of the word stems
<BR>
from this political environment, as well as from a simple misunderstanding
<BR>
of what &quot;intelligence&quot; is all about. Gardner is not the first to hold this
<BR>
misconception. It was this misconception in the American originators of
<BR>
intelligence testing (The &quot;Stanford&quot;, as in Stanford University, in
<BR>
&quot;Stanford-Binet) that led to the orgy of misplaced functionalist testing
<BR>
that the US Army employed during World War II, and that many American
<BR>
institutions adopted afterwards. The misconception that &quot;intelligence&quot; is a
<BR>
centralized particular function of the brain, and the most important one to
<BR>
boot. It is not, and Binet never believed that it was. Binet's tests were
<BR>
never intended as general-purpose aptitude tests. They were exactly what
<BR>
they were, a test of mathematical/verbal abstract symbolic reasoning,
<BR>
comparing children against others in their peer group, for the stated
<BR>
purpose of identifying children in need of special help at school.
<BR>
<P>QueenMUSE, returning to your contention that Gardner's conceptualization is
<BR>
valid because it is useful in education, we seem to have come full circle
<BR>
:). Gardner's work ECHOS Binet's, in deemphasizing the universal
<BR>
all-importance of symbolic reasoning. Where it fails, is in continuing to
<BR>
use the word &quot;intelligence&quot; in it's ridiculous, functionalist sense, instead
<BR>
of the original, empirical sense.
<BR>
<P>What Binet referred to as &quot;intelligence&quot; was a particular cognitive ability.
<BR>
What Gardner refers to as &quot;intelligences&quot; are cognitive abilities. The
<BR>
definition was distorted by the psychologists at Stanford in the 30's and
<BR>
40's. To denigrate the weakening of the definition of intelligence, from
<BR>
&quot;particular cognitive ability&quot; to &quot;cognitive ability&quot; is not to &quot;look back
<BR>
to the tried and true&quot;, but to propagate a ridiculous error, the continuance
<BR>
of which is responsible for a large part of the ridiculous non-empiricism
<BR>
found in psychology today.
