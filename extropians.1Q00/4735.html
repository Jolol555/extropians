<P>
As Spike pointed out, my posting on Laser deposition got cut off.
<BR>
Guess, I'm not clever enough to multiplex postings to the extropians
<BR>
and Slashdot at the same time.... :-(.
<BR>
<P>At any rate, I'll try to complete the thought --
<BR>
<P>Spudboy100 wrote about the possibility of building nanotech via                  
<BR>
laser deposition (his actual posting was about Laser Deposition
<BR>
Spectroscopy &amp; sorting matter by atomic weight which seem unrelated).
<BR>
<P>I don't think this is feasible.  Normal light has wavelengths much
<BR>
bigger than atomic scales.  This is why current lithographic
<BR>
methods are having to move into shorter wavelengths in the EUV,
<BR>
X-ray, and eventually E-beam.
<BR>
See:

<BR>
<P>There is technology in the pipeline [see Nanotechnology, G. Timp (ed.),
<BR>
in Chapter 10: Atom Optics: Using Light to Position Atoms], but
<BR>
the methods demonstrated are being used to draw lines, not 2-D
<BR>
patterns.  Now, perhaps by rotating 90 degrees and repeating
<BR>
you might turn lines into squares, but the method seems limited
<BR>
and is definitely not precise down to the small molecule/atomic
<BR>
level.
<BR>
<P>Of interest when researching this comment, I came across the
<BR>
fact that things really are getting faster.  As:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ebnews.com/story/OEG19990505S0009">http://www.ebnews.com/story/OEG19990505S0009</A>
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.semibiznews.com/story/OEG19991122S0026">http://www.semibiznews.com/story/OEG19991122S0026</A>
<BR>
show, the manufacturers are *dropping* the entire 0.15-micron
<BR>
chip generation and pushing the timetable to get us to 35 nm
<BR>
(64 Si atoms wide) by 2014.  Nikon expect to have the e-beam
<BR>
systems in production by 2006 when they will be used to produce
<BR>
16-gigabit DRAMs.
<BR>
<P>Not everything is surging ahead however.  It looks like DRAMs
<BR>
will give way to Microprocessors as the technology driver.
<BR>
My guess would be that programmer productivity is insufficient
<BR>
to write programs that require 16 gigabytes of memory!!!
<BR>
Things will shift again however when the microprocessor
<BR>
architectures move to processor-in-memory and you can put
<BR>
dozens of them into desktop machines.
<BR>
<P>Real nanotech (atomic assembly), derived from top-down approaches,
<BR>
would seem to be on track for circa 2010 at least in the lab.
