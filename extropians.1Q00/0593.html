<P>
<EM>&gt;This incorporates a weird assumption, to my mind, that the taking of drugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;induces unruliness.  Indeed, it's one of the big arguments of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pro-marijuana debaters that marijuana, for example, doesn't make you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unruly in the way that, for example, alcohol does.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on the drugs doesn't it? Who wants to take drugs that will make them
<BR>
into compliant robot slaves of the state? Unruliness doesn't necessitate the
<BR>
implication of freedom from the state. The state may in fact encourage drug
<BR>
crazed assassins to carry on the work of politics by other means.
<BR>
<P>Drug use does not threaten the ruling class. The ruling class takes drugs to
<BR>
assuage its own feelings of existential angst. A drugged ruling class continues
<BR>
to insist that its subjects remain soberly productive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So why not make marijuana a prescription drug?  Or opium?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because to do so, the ruling class must admit that it had erred in making them
<BR>
illegal. Furthermore (and probably more significantly), the ruling class
<BR>
generates untold wealth for itself via confiscation of personal property in
<BR>
connection with drug busts. In addition, pharmaceutical companies (a sector of
<BR>
the ruling class, after all) eschew the idea of people self-medicating
<BR>
themselves -- better to have professionals in charge, in control, and in the
<BR>
chips. Self-medication threatens the ruling class' hold on this lucrative
<BR>
industry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characterize this behavior as foolishness, (since opiating the masses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be wiser than forbidding the use of opium,) but I don't see how you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can consistently characterize this as the ruling class trying to protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their ruling status.
</EM><BR>
<P>People can grow their own opium poppies, but they can't manufacture their own
<BR>
Ritalin.
<BR>
Again, self-medication (illicit drug use) threatens the power of the ruling
<BR>
class.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I DO have an axe to grind.  All too often I hear people ascribe all sorts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of crazy behavior to the &quot;ruling class,&quot; usually in a conspiratorial mood,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though not always, and invariably with little explanation.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prostitution?  Blame the man.  Can't smoke up?  Blame the man.  Late to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work?  Somewhere, somehow, the man's responsible.
</EM><BR>
<P>So who do you blame?
<BR>
<P>**********************
<BR>
<P>&quot;The whole gospel of Karl Marx can be summed up in a single sentence: Hate
<BR>
the man who is better off than you are. Never under any circumstances admit
<BR>
that his success may be due to his own efforts, to the productive
<BR>
contribution he has made to the whole community. Always attribute his
<BR>
success to the exploitation, the cheating, the more or less open robbery of
<BR>
others. Never under any circumstances admit that your own failure may be
<BR>
owing to your own weakness, or that the failure of anyone else may be due to
<BR>
his own defects -- his laziness, incompetence, improvidence, or
<BR>
stupidity.&quot; --Henry Hazlitt
