<EM>&gt;ABSTRACT:  What daring 21st century concepts or projects would you most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like to see pursued, if money were no object?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;If I had a $100+ million that I could afford to use for charitable
<BR>
purposes, the first project that would come to mind is trying to
<BR>
buy Unisys' gif patent and licensing it out in a way that would create
<BR>
political pressure against the patent office's attempts to unreasonably
<BR>
expand the importance of patents.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Other projects that come to mind are mind uploading and cryonics research.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Traditional sources of mega-capital -- business and government -- have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constituencies (voters and stockholders) that demand accountability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;risk avoidance.  Return horizons of five years are typical.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contrast, private individuals may choose to gamble on ventures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genuine vision, especially when the chief repercussion of failure is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mere loss of investment (not, say, damage to human life or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ecosystems).
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Individual donations avoid some of the dumbing down effects of committee
<BR>
decision making, but most individual charity is still motivated by the
<BR>
desire to impress people today, rather than to produce some impressive
<BR>
breakthrough a decade from now. Which means that it won't be easy to
<BR>
convince philanthropists to fund the kind of unusual projects that I
<BR>
think truly altruistic donors would be looking for.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Instead of focussing on the goals of charity (which are probably harder
<BR>
to change than you seem to assume), how about changing the way the money
<BR>
is spent?
<BR>
&nbsp;If we could create the assumption that the typical charitable gift as it
<BR>
works today is used inefficiently because the donors rarely check how well
<BR>
the money is spent, then we might be able to create social pressure to
<BR>
use more effective processes such as information prizes. For instance,
<BR>
it's hard for me to tell whether people who pledged money to Paul Wakfer's
<BR>
Promotheus Project had reason to believe the money would be spent on
<BR>
valuable cryonics research. I'd have more confidence that such money
<BR>
would be well spent if it were pledged towards a prize that got awarded
<BR>
to the first researchers to revive a rat from liquid nitrogen temperatures.
