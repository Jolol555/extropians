<P>Zeb, I hate to tell you this, but there are *virtually* no controls
<BR>
on the access to biotech.  An amateur could even order the most dangerous
<BR>
bacteria from the ATCC up until a few years ago (they've tightened up
<BR>
on this after somebody did).   Of course they haven't quite realized
<BR>
that it isn't the life-forms you have to secure, its the information
<BR>
about the lifeforms.  There are controls on the access to chemicals
<BR>
that are potential upstream feedstock for &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs.  (But a
<BR>
clever chemist could probably work around this).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [snip], it wouldn't be long before someone caught on to the idea of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering goats to produce morphine in their milk as well, or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variations on this theme (I've had this idea for a while, in the form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering bees so that rather then stinger venom, they produce THC,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morphine, cocaine, or whatever, which they inject into someone upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stinging).
</EM><BR>
<P>While I think the bee engineering makes little sense (entertainment
<BR>
perhaps?), as soon as the complete pathways are know for the production
<BR>
of the aforementioned drugs, then engineering them into bacteria or
<BR>
goats will take a relatively small scale G.E. effort.
<BR>
<P>The government can spot coca plants -- how can it spot fermentation
<BR>
apparatus in everyones basement?
<BR>
<P>The best thing to do would be to produce the bacteria and put the
<BR>
culturing information up on the net, then offer to mail anyone
<BR>
who sends you some amount of money an envelope with the GE-bacteria
<BR>
impregnated into the envelope flap glue.  Just deposit the envelope
<BR>
paper in your home grown fermentation apparatus and voila' -- instant
<BR>
drug plant.  The most interesting part is that its probably legal
<BR>
(currently).  I don't know of any laws prohibiting the distribution
<BR>
of bacteria that manufacture drugs... :-)
<BR>
<P>[If the above statement doesn't get me arrested tomorrow, then we
<BR>
can assume the Feds are not monitoring this list...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From what I understand, this would be technically possible today,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by inserting the proper genes from the poppy, the coca plant, or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marijuana plant into the proper place in the bee genome.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but most of the genes are probably not currently known.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nanotech would make drug access even easier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nanotech probably makes drug access irrelevant.  You can have nanorobots
<BR>
do manufacture, controlled uptake and release of the neurotransmitters
<BR>
(or variants thereof) that trip the standard &quot;drug&quot; receptors.  The
<BR>
interesting part is that when you press the &quot;sequester&quot; switch, there
<BR>
is probably no way for the authorities to discover you are harboring
<BR>
a &quot;controlled&quot; substance without a highly invasive dismantlement of
<BR>
your nanobots!
<BR>
<P>Police Nanobot says to Self-Nanobot, &quot;do you have any drugs in your
<BR>
possession?&quot;.  Reply, &quot;Why no sir, I do not&quot;.  Police: &quot;Ok, open up
<BR>
all of your holding tanks for analysis&quot;.  Self: I must refrain from
<BR>
doing so on the basis of preventing self-incrimination...   It gets
<BR>
dicey if the nanobots are highly integrated into your mental architecture
<BR>
and the police have to destroy them to prove you are harboring drugs.
<BR>
I find it difficult to believe that courts would grant search warrants
<BR>
that were guaranteed to damage the subject of the search.
<BR>
<P><P>Interesting thoughts otherwise Zeb, food for the grist mill.
