</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Billy Brown
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I want to know what THE LIST envisions their OWN personal experience of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; uploading, not what sci-fi authors think.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The main difference I see is that it removes a lot of inertia from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system.  Now you can inhabit any kind of physical body as easily as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visiting a web site.  You can have an equally good interface into any VR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world you care to visit, instead of being limited by the physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance of your interface equipment.
</EM><BR>
<P>These features are fairly superficial.  So interfaces with VR are better,
<BR>
so complete sensory immersion in VR is standard.  That is certainly
<BR>
exciting and has potential but it is not the most powerful feature.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can run yourself faster or slower than real time, and your software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfaces aren't limited by the bandwidth of organic tissue.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is more dramatic.  But then:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There should be a huge market for mental modifications, since some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant fraction of the population is going to upload themselves, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-enhancement should become progressively easier as you replace chunks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of neuron simulation with something more manageable.
</EM><BR>
<P>The [inertia] that we are removing is the unapproachable and inflexible
<BR>
quality of our current mind machines.  The most obvious and powerful
<BR>
feature is this capability to self-modify (easily).  So the really
<BR>
difficult question is: once you are uploaded exactly what do you do (with
<BR>
the matrix of code that is your mind)?  That is, just how do you---to use a
<BR>
term I've never liked---bootstrap significantly?  Answer in complete
<BR>
sentences, list all sources, and show all work.  Time limit: now until
<BR>
soon.
<BR>
<P>We don't have many of the neuroscientific details right now so it's a very
<BR>
difficult question.  We can't be sure that some of our higher-level
<BR>
architectural notions about the mind are accurate.  In order to increase
<BR>
intelligence what do you change?  What do you delete and what do you try to
<BR>
build?  Some ideas at least might be developed now, as design-ahead
<BR>
solutions.
<BR>
<P>As Damien said, we're not going to be Captain Future acting out space
<BR>
operas.  But many here have described human sensor augmentation and VR
<BR>
residency, which are actually not that different; they seem to be based too
<BR>
heavily upon human foundations.  Again, they're neat options for us now but
<BR>
I think that many of us, once we figure a few things out, will not bother.
