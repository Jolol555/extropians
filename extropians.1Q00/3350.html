<BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that chemical reactions tend to increase entropy in the long run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not necessarily imply that they destroy information in this sense.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you know what the reaction is, and you know what the reactants and the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products look like, you can just look at the end result and say &quot;oh, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decay reaction X, so this protein must have stated out like so...&quot;  Doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same thing when you have lots of different reactions going on is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complicated, but that just increases the computational requirements.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as the end state is uniquely determined by the initial state and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know history of the system, you can in principle compute the initial state.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, in principle, but then you are back to Eugene's super-gods who can
<BR>
reconstruct everyone from atmospheric molecule motions.  Once information
<BR>
has degraded into heat, there is no practical technology which is going
<BR>
to be able to re-create that information.  And such degradation is exactly
<BR>
what happens in chemical reactions that increase entropy.  Distinguishable
<BR>
states transform into indistinguishable states.  Macro scale information
<BR>
(at least at the molecular and structural level) changes into micro
<BR>
scale information (meaning heat).
<BR>
<P>If you grant the impossibility of a technology which can analyze random
<BR>
molecular thermal motion and &quot;play it back&quot; to recreate the entire past
<BR>
in microscopic detail, then you must accept that an increase in entropy
<BR>
is a loss of information.  From the final state there are multiple initial
<BR>
states which could have produced it, and the only way to distinguish them
<BR>
is in the micro-information of the thermal motions.  Put another way,
<BR>
from decay products alone you cannot construct a unique set of initial
<BR>
compounds which would have decayed to form these results, in general.
<BR>
<P>I maintain that given our current state of knowledge, we simply don't
<BR>
know whether there is sufficient information in frozen tissue to
<BR>
reconstruct its initial state to any particular degree of precision.
