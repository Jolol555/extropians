<P>
'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and a hell of a lot of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *Which screen* you look at depends on *what* you're looking for.  If I want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find out what *you* did today, I command &quot;play Fabulich video 03-29-2000, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6:00 to 18:00 PST&quot; and your boring day plays out on my monitor for 9 hours, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or until I get bored and press &quot;stop.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>You're DEEPLY missing the point here.  Sure, if you know when and where to
<BR>
look, you can see what was going on there.  How did you know that you
<BR>
needed to look at *my* video to find the murder?  How did you know when to
<BR>
look? How does the computer know where I was?  All of this requires a
<BR>
thinker/computer to stare at the screen and do some processing.  Without
<BR>
it, you can't even make the above simple request for &quot;Fabulich.&quot;  On the
<BR>
other hand, you COULD request &quot;Yale University, undergraduate room 472B,
<BR>
03-29-2000, 6 to 18 EST&quot;, but it's not at all obvious how you figured out
<BR>
to look THERE knowing only that you wanted to find a murder.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;So no one, not even a despot, could prevent you from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;observing his every move.  One would *still* need to analyze the data, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;figure out which screen to look at.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, which &quot;screen&quot; you look *at* depends on what you are looking *for*.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Think of the web as a huge database (which in effect it is).  Right now 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are millions and millions of pages on the web.  But you don't need to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do any big time &quot;data analysis&quot; to use the web.  Why?  You go to your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handy-dandy search engine, type in what you are looking for and viola! a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice neat little list of choices pops up for you to choose from.  I can't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe this is such a hard concept to grasp.
</EM><BR>
<P>A very large amount of preprocessing has gone into the Internet:
<BR>
everything you can search for there has been painstakingly typed in by a
<BR>
human in a form that is easily searchable.  It's already stored as
<BR>
information which the computer knows to be text.
<BR>
<P>You may not be aware of this, but it's very difficult to get a computer to
<BR>
correctly recognize that a picture of a given page of text is text at all,
<BR>
say nothing of figuring out which text.  You can search a copy of the US
<BR>
Constitution that I type in and put online.  You can't search a photograph
<BR>
of a printout of that same document without a lot of processing and a lot
<BR>
of hard work on the part of programmers.  It's taken us years to get to
<BR>
the point where we are today with optical character recognition; the
<BR>
process has been extremely slow-going.  Same goes for speech recognition,
<BR>
the process of identifying a sound to be speech, and determining which
<BR>
words are being said.
<BR>
<P>But identifying text is a piece of cake compared to identifying people.  
<BR>
Trying to explain what a person looks like to a computer is, as Eliezer
<BR>
might say, just one step above trying to explain it to a rock.  Today, we
<BR>
don't have anything which can do this anywhere near as well as a human can
<BR>
(to the best of my knowledge; this project is hard, but not impossible).
<BR>
If you'd done very much programming you'd see why this is so hard.  All
<BR>
the computer knows is a grid of numbers (a grid which, as we happen to
<BR>
know, corresponds to a grid of colors).  Based on that alone, the computer
<BR>
has to identify what a person looks like.  Notice also that the computer
<BR>
can only use simple arithmetic and set theory to process those numbers. So
<BR>
I want you to imagine a function which uses only arithmetic/logical
<BR>
operators, (+, *, =, OR, NOT) and membership relations, (X is a member of
<BR>
set Y), takes as its input a grid of numbers, and yields as its output a 1
<BR>
if the grid of numbers corresponds to a picture of a person, and a 0
<BR>
otherwise.  Can you see how hard this is?  It's not impossible, obviously,
<BR>
but it's Very difficult.  That's why we still haven't done it thus far.
<BR>
<P>So the concept &quot;is the letter H&quot; and the concept &quot;is a picture of a
<BR>
person&quot; are fairly complicated concepts which are very difficult to
<BR>
explain to a computer.  Now try explaining to that computer what
<BR>
'wrongdoing' or 'harm to me' looks like in terms of the membership
<BR>
relation and the successor function.  Or what any action looks like.  
<BR>
Computers today can't reliably tell the difference between a video of a
<BR>
man shooting a gun at a bunch of helpless innocents and a porn clip.  
<BR>
This is not because they're not powerful enough; if they were ten million
<BR>
times faster, it wouldn't help.  We have no good way of explaining to the
<BR>
computer exactly which data in corresponds to which data out.
<BR>
<P>This IS a VERY hard problem.  It's a problem which we cannot solve today.
<BR>
<P>&quot;OK,&quot; you might say.  &quot;The AI of tomorrow will solve it.  It'll be very
<BR>
powerful.  It'll use all the latest buzzwords.&quot;  Fine.  But that's a lot
<BR>
of processing power you're talking about.  Whoever controls all that
<BR>
processing power gets to keep the results.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Go back to the web analogy.  The government doesn't control the search 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engines now.  There is no reason that the &quot;government&quot; would have to control 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the transparency servers I talk about.  Sure there could be government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; servers, but those would not be the *only* ones.  Given the importance of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the integrity of the data in such a society, redundancy would be the word of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the day.  Probably the best solution would call for an oversight body 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containing both government officials and civilians, like police review 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boards.  Reliable checks and balances systems are not all that difficult to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implement.  After all here in the US we've been doing them for over 200 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could happen.  Nobody (except maybe Lorrey) will argue that if the system
<BR>
you describe is implemented, it's guaranteed to result in a totalitarian
<BR>
state.  But every technology which benefits the powerful more than it
<BR>
benefits the weak makes this MORE likely.  Again, my argument is that
<BR>
since this system makes despotism easier, more likely, etc. we should, to
<BR>
whatever extent possible, avoid it.
<BR>
<P>The gov't doesn't control the web servers today, but it has no reason to
<BR>
do so.  It WOULD have a reason to try to seize control of servers of the
<BR>
kind you're describing.  And it would know if you ever tried to resist
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Checks and balances can work, but if the price was right, a despot would
<BR>
throw them out the window.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But, once again, regardless of who was in control of the servers, as long as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system was sufficiently transparent it would not matter.  All that is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed is that the transparency of the process can be assured (and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verified).
</EM><BR>
<P>Look, allow me to provide a theoretical account from first principles.  In
<BR>
order to stop wrongdoing, you need all of the following:
<BR>
<P>1)  You need to have the information that wrongdoing is going on. 2)  You
<BR>
need to recognize that wrongdoing is going on, and determine relevant
<BR>
information about it (where it's happening, who's doing it, what you'd
<BR>
need to do to stop it, given the power to do so, etc.). 3)  You must have
<BR>
the physical force to stop the wrongdoing, or you must be believed to
<BR>
have the force to stop the wrongdoing.
<BR>
<P>In the Very Extreme Case, consider the situation where I've got guns and
<BR>
shields and 1 and 2, whereas you only have 1.  You MUST agree that in
<BR>
*this* case, despite the fact that the scenario is perfectly transparent
<BR>
(&quot;look ma! it's transparent BOTH WAYS&quot;) there isn't jack shit you can do
<BR>
about it.
<BR>
<P>Now, you know that YOU'RE opposed to despotism, but do you know that
<BR>
others are also opposed?  Probably not.  Why?  Because the gov't in this
<BR>
scenario has 1 and 2; it knows when you're trying to find subversives; it
<BR>
knows what that looks like and can identify them instantly.  You know that
<BR>
it knows this.  You don't know whether your neighbor is willing to revolt
<BR>
or whether he's too scared to do so.  You also know that the last time
<BR>
somebody asked somebody else whether they were willing to revolt, the
<BR>
government had them shot.  Nobody found out until it was too late, because
<BR>
they had 1, but not 2, which would have allowed them to find out in time.
<BR>
<P>The point here is that having 2 when everyone else doesn't is a huge
<BR>
advantage.  Having 2 and 3 when everyone else doesn't gives you the power
<BR>
to be a despot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Keep the Internet analogy in mind.  *Tons* of data, almost no data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crunching.  What you want is what you get, when you want it.  Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would you think our ability to sort, organize, store and retrieve data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will get *worse* in the future than it is now?
</EM><BR>
<P>It won't.  Video data is much harder to process than text.  That's what
<BR>
will make it harder.
