<P>I was going on stuff at least 15 years old, but I think it's been
<BR>
corroborated since. Here's a bit from my THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS. While
<BR>
J-P C is talking abt mature brains, I read it back to an account of the
<BR>
formation of the internal nets (and BTW I love his use of `singularities'...):
<BR>
<P>============
<BR>
<P>The collective-computational program [blah blah]  The human equivalent has
<BR>
been described by a prominent French neurologist, who borrows the somewhat
<BR>
misleading medieval term `homunculus' to denote a cortical `body map' of
<BR>
some discrete part of the somatosensory system:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[I]n a given sensory homunculus, two neurons that respond in the same way
<BR>
to the same sensory signal still differ in that they are not in exactly the
<BR>
same position on the map and therefore are related to topographically
<BR>
distinct sensory cells on the surface of the body or in the retina.  If one
<BR>
considers that there are about fifteen million neurons per square
<BR>
centimeter of cortical surface and that in man a single homunculus can have
<BR>
an area of several square centimeters, the set of singularities ... becomes
<BR>
enormous. [...A]s exploration continues it becomes clear that every neuron
<BR>
has its own singularity.%  In reality, there is very little redundancy.&quot;
<BR>
(Changeux, 1985, p. 122)#
<BR>
<P>Jean-Pierre Changeux is an unrepentant determinist, though the picture he
<BR>
presents is too awesomely complex to be considered simple-mindedly
<BR>
reductionist.  But he insists, `The data obtained so far, although
<BR>
fragmentary, are sufficient for us to safely conclude that all behavior,
<BR>
all sensation, is explicable by an internal mobilization of a topologically
<BR>
defined set of nerve cells, a specific graph.  The &quot;geography&quot; of this
<BR>
network defines the specificity of the function' (Changeux, p. 124).
<BR>
Nobel-winning immunologist Gerald Edelman (1992) has developed a similar
<BR>
selectionist account, which he dubs `neural Darwinism'.  Neurophysiologist
<BR>
William Calvin (1996a, 1996b) has proposed an impressive account linking
<BR>
consciousness with hexagonal structures of the brain's own neural net,
<BR>
which he regards as a `Darwin machine'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
%Defined p. 65: `the set of connections' `of each cell taken individually'
<BR>
each of which includes the effects of `several tens of thousands of
<BR>
synaptic contacts'.
