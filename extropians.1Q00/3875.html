Hal forwarded from a Nature article trying to explain why the other lane
<BR>
seems faster by appealing to various illusions. I have an alternative
<BR>
explanation: The other lane *is* faster.
<BR>
<P>A lane is slow because there are more cars in it. But that means that most
<BR>
observers are in slow lanes. Most of the time, &quot;the other&quot; lane should thus
<BR>
be genuinely faster.

<P><EM>		&gt;I have in fact found that if I keep a running count, plus

or minus, as
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;cars pass me and I pass them back, I do find that the

actual progress
<BR>

discouraging than my

driving.
<BR>
<P>Well, obviously on average that must hold, since overtaking one car (+1)
<BR>
means that exactly one car is overtaken (-1). But most of the *time* you
<BR>
would be in the process of being overtaken rather than overtaking. This is
<BR>
related to the point that the Nature article makes, that a driver overtakes
<BR>
many cars in a short time, since the slower moving cars are packed closer
<BR>
together, while those same cars will take a longer time to overtake the
<BR>
drive, since they are then moving faster and are spread out over a longer
<BR>
interval.
