<P>
<EM>&gt;From my reply to Brin:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - 2 -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's impossible to make any money off a bright idea for a new business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless you are either (1) a venture capitalist, or (2) you have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unique high-energy charismatic personality, experience, and credentials
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary to found your own startup.  However, many of the most creative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and visionary people, perhaps a majority, do not have the energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to work 16-hour days.  In an environment of too much venture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital chasing too few ideas, this is absurd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to see a Genesis Idea Broker, an Idealab!-like entity, except
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that instead of funding Bill Gross's business ideas, it would accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business ideas from private individuals.  If an individual's idea is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accepted, it gets put together with a pre-assembled proto-startup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containing a CEO and other individuals who have applied to be employed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a Genesis Company, and venture capital is added from venture funds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that have applied to fund a Genesis Company.  The visionary goes on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Board of Directors as the 'Genesis Director' and gets 5% of whatever the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CEO gets (in salary, stock, and options).  This method could create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enormous quantities of new wealth, hundreds or thousands of new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies, by combining independent and inexhaustible sources of people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas, and money.  You would need creative, intelligent, and pragmatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to filter through the thousands of ideas that would initially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pour in, and there would be other difficulties, but the first person to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get it working would be richer than Gates and Croesus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Initial versions might have a restricted membership of idea-generators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to cut down on the spam, but you'd have to be very careful to select for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity and brilliance rather than energy and credentials.  The idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to tap personalities and modes of thinking that have been ruled out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the previous startup selection criteria.  There are very fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitive reasons why high-energy, enthusiastic minds - minds saturated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the 'positive' emotions - tend not to think in certain ways; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious social and cognitive reasons why a committee of distinguished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientists isn't likely to produce a revolution unless there's at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one teenager in the room with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, there are many ways that Genesis Idea Broker, Inc. could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwed up so as to duplicate the restrictive idea-selection criteria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used nowadays, but as Genesis Director of GIB I'd be in a position to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help keep the vision clean.
</EM><BR>
