<EM>&gt; This means that I can take a brain and replace every neuron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a small chip that behaves like a simple neuron (i.e it fires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it has recieved enough signals to exceed its treshold).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing novel yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But what if I make every chip record its own state and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a while tell all my neurochips to play what they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded. The result would be a real consciousness that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiences something that has already happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since each chip has a record of its own states, we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually cut the wires connecting them and still get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the neurochips to play its recordings like nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has happened, the consciousness would still be there.
</EM><BR>
<P>We did discuss some variants on this thought experiment last year.
<BR>
The problem is that it works OK to say that consciousness is a certain
<BR>
kind of computation, but that there does not seem to be a completely
<BR>
reliable definition of what a computation is.
<BR>
<P>One idea which has been proposed was that the replay is not conscious,
<BR>
because it lacks &quot;counterfactual reliability&quot;.  That is, to get
<BR>
consciousness you not only have to play back a sequence of states, you
<BR>
must run a machine which would also reproduce the proper behavior IF it
<BR>
were given different inputs.
<BR>
<P>In other words, consciousness is reduced to computation, but computation
<BR>
must be defined over a set of possible inputs, not just one particular
<BR>
input.
<BR>
<P>It is hard to see how things which don't happen (the counterfactual
<BR>
inputs) can affect something which does happen (the here-and-now
<BR>
consciousness), but this idea does seem to resolve some of the paradoxes.
