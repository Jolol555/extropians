<P><EM>&gt; Funny, but I pictured the Jupiter brain as being alone in space.... utterly

<EM>&gt; unmanageable due to the gravitational disturbance caused by the star and

<EM>&gt; the other stuff.

<P>OK Jeff, but what I had in mind was a system where you have a
<BR>
heat source and a heat sink, so you have a long term energy cycle
<BR>
going on.  Your idea was brilliant and entertaining.  I had a lotta
<BR>
fun with it.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>I spun off an idea which is far less dramatic but might have some
<BR>
immediate applications: an interplanetary version of GPS.  Looks
<BR>
like we could orbit three atomic clocks around the sun somewhere
<BR>
between earth and Mars, from which one could navigate to a precision
<BR>
high enough to avoid another Mars lander debacle.  spike
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The non-standard nature of this problem would probably make it quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting to someone jaded by long experience with &quot;ordinary&quot; orbital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanics calculations.  One thing's for sure,  it's more than I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle.  Spike?  (Amara, you should try this only if you find it pleasant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and self-fulfilling. ;-) )
</EM><BR>
<P>Orbitting inside a planet might be more than I can handle too, at least
<BR>
in closed form, and I dont like wimpy numerical solutions.  They lack
<BR>
a certain beauty.
<BR>
<P>Here's one I thought about:  suppose you had a solid uniform sphere,
<BR>
Earth-sized, with a 600 km diameter hole drilled thru the middle.
<BR>
Suppose the construction workers toss stuff in the hole just for the
<BR>
fun of seeing it pop back up 88 minutes later.  At first it does so, but
<BR>
some yahoo on the other side has the same idea and pretty soon
<BR>
a lot of people are throwing garbage in the enormous bottomless pit,
<BR>
and consequently the stuff starts to hit other junk and lose
<BR>
energy and a big ball of stuff starts to form in the center.  Or does
<BR>
it?  What is the shape of the gravitational field in that tunnel?
<BR>
<P>We already know if one were inside a huge hollow sphere there
<BR>
is no gravitational field, easily proven by one integral, but what
<BR>
about a sphere with a cylindrical tunnel?  spike
