Well, resisting the urge to make a deluge of comments and keeping in line 
<BR>
with my desire that this doesn't escalate into messiness (or perhaps due to 
<BR>
the fact that a close friend just recently killed himself and I don't really 
<BR>
feel up to it), I'll just make a couple general, and hopefully fairly 
<BR>
inoffensive, comments:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been my observation that many people who call themselves 
<BR>
Libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, and the like, espouse at least some ideas 
<BR>
that are firmly within the Anarchist (&quot;left&quot; anarchist, libertarian 
<BR>
socialist, etc.) camp.  I've also experienced Anarchist ideas and methods 
<BR>
naturally bubbling up in various social environments, in particular at the 
<BR>
Foresight Group Genius Weekend last year (where several list members were in 
<BR>
attendance), as well as in the Free Software movement and in the growing 
<BR>
trend against excessive intellectual property rights and patents.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that with a thoughtful reading of the afore mentioned FAQ 
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/</A>), with a careful eye on your own 
<BR>
memes that are sure to throw up walls, and with a sincere desire to 
<BR>
understand it, many people will find some surprising points of agreement, as 
<BR>
well as answers to most criticisms you may have.  (That would take quite a 
<BR>
bit of time, though; the damn thing has over two and a half megs of text.)  
<BR>
I wouldn't expect anyone to agree with all of it, however; I don't even 
<BR>
agree with all of it, but I do think that it is an important chunk of text 
<BR>
and is well worth reading.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe you'll completely disagree and write me off as a flake.  I can 
<BR>
live with that.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
-Travas
