<EM>&gt; spike:  On that day we pick our favorite extropian(s), write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a parody of their posts, immitating their style, etc, preferably with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a comic twist.  We send that person the parody at which time, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are in a playful mood, they post as is, or modify, etc.

<EM>&gt; I like the idea, but I'd leave it on April 1: that's been kind of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net-head holiday for along time anyway, and rather than sending the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parodies to their subjects I'd just post them forged (of course those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of us without a dedicated server will have to get a friend to do that).
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I object to that, sorry Lee.  The thing hasta be done in fun, but
<BR>
there could be problems with encouraging forged posts, and besides
<BR>
I think mosta the extropians I know wouldnt object to posting
<BR>
parodies of themselves for a little laugh.
<BR>
<P>There are people on this list who *might* object to the whole
<BR>
notion, who do and perhaps *should* take the archived record
<BR>
seriously, such as the PhDs, the officers of extropians, those who
<BR>
really would rather see this list as a more serious forum than a
<BR>
party, etc.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I know and trust the people on this list well enough
<BR>
that I grant *permission* for anyone to directly post a forged
<BR>
parody of me, on either 1 or 2 April, or hell, anytime.  But I would
<BR>
not wish to see forged posts of non-volunteers to be thus
<BR>
parodied.  Hard feelings could result on their part.  spike
