Ditto.
<BR>
<P>The thinking which has driven digital technology to satisfy  moore's law
<BR>
to create  &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; for the consumer  has created a
<BR>
massive consolidation of economic resources based upon
<BR>
physical assets which are essentially nearly worthless in a traditional
<BR>
economic sense.
<BR>
<P>Medicine is still based upon assumptions that disease and death are
<BR>
inevitable and rewards to the economic engine are to be based upon
<BR>
keeping societal  medical costs to less than  $830,000 per first world
<BR>
citizen.  A  paridigm shift which would  give medical economists and
<BR>
ethicists  some grief would  be  a public mandated  requirement  to
<BR>
apply moore's law to medical economics.
<BR>
<P>To be both cost effective and ethical , medicine has to fully
<BR>
commercialize medical knowledge in extremely short time slices.
<BR>
Developments which had product life cycles  starting with extremely
<BR>
expensive procedures or medical products  used by a handful and ending
<BR>
in cheap procedures/products utilized by anyone with even marginal
<BR>
resources and a desire to access a procedure/product  traditionally took
<BR>
decades to reach full worldwide commercialization.   Digital technology
<BR>
is the key to  making moore's law applicable to medicine.
<BR>
<P>The cost to generate the code underlying a windows 2000 program is only
<BR>
justified if there are a hundred million users in less than 3 years
<BR>
willing to fork out $100 each for the end product.  The key to making
<BR>
medical economics ethical is to deliver drugs, procedures similarly.
<BR>
Doctors are to be advisors and the patient the  ones to satisfy.
<BR>
<P>The need to mate the trillion in internet market capitalization with a
<BR>
trillion in real world business
<BR>
(ex the AOL -Time Warner merger) might just be the  spark to start a
<BR>
medical economics and ethics paridigm shift.
<BR>
<P>Anyway it's 3 AM here so I will have to leave these thoughts for another
<BR>
day.

A gaggle of medical ethicists had a conference in Philadelphia last week. It was about
<BR>
the need for death. Apparently all these people are smart enough to dress and feed
<BR>
themselves without help and some have even learned to read and write. They learned how
<BR>
to write doctoral dissertations and how receive government grants. It made them more
<BR>
ethical. I guess that's how they became so much more moral than you or me.
<BR>
Here are a few of the things these wise sages had to say:
<BR>
<P>&quot;We can't ban this  [longer life] research but we can make it socially despicable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot; The finitude of human life is a blessing whether he knows it or not.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;To delay death is to delay union with God.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;[immortality is] a pagan and sub Christian quest.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;To argue that human life is better without death is to argue human life would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be better without being human.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The really strange thing is that I read about this in the Science section of the
<BR>
New York Times, not the religion section or the comics. I said it before I'll say
<BR>
it again, medical ethicists are the lowest form of human life.
