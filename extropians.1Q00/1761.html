</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Algebraic/formulaic. He proposes that we are, after four hundred years of

<EM>&gt; great epoch of Mathematics; that of concurrent, computationally intensive
</EM><BR>

<P>This is an interesting supposition, but I don't buy it. Now, most of my friends 
<BR>
are either mathematicians, or computer scientists (I'm in the latter camp), and 
<BR>
from the discussions we've had it looks like the place that Mathematics is 
<BR>
headed are the fields of descriptive frameworks. Such things as rings, groups, 
<BR>
lattices and other mathematical structures are a step in this direction. As are 
<BR>
function valued functions (functors? functionals? I forget what they are 
<BR>
called.) Now, this is not divorced from computer science, as such things as 
<BR>
type theory and category theory have direct application to the designs of 
<BR>
programs. The items you list, such as Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms 
<BR>
are currently mathematically intractable, and most mathematicians I've talked 
<BR>
to don't have much to good to say about them.
