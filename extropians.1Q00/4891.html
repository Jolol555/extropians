<EM>&gt; &gt;Okay, I confess, every time I take public transport and have a gun with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;me, I imagine what I might do if that creep from the Long Island
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Railroad were to appear.  And sometimes I fantasize about getting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;drop on Gianluigi Ferri, who shot eight people in the building where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;now work (a year before I started there).  Guess that makes me one sick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fuck, eh?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *You* might say that.  I must confess that every time I take public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transport I imagine what I nice way to travel it would be if I didn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to worry about somebody sitting next to me with a cannon in his pocket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fantasizing about the _Dirty Harry_ movie he watched last night.

<P>The issue here is not the presence of the gun but rather one of poor
<BR>
impulse control. If I'm in an environment where I feel that people are
<BR>
likely to act on their fanciful ruminations about &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, the
<BR>
presence of a gun is a somewhat secondary concern. Unfortunately, this
<BR>
kind of environment exists in just about any public place. I try to
<BR>
minimize contact with the more dubious environments, but I also don't
<BR>
let it rule my life.
<BR>
<P>In this debate, people who are against guns (or are for stricter gun
<BR>
laws/enforcement, etc.) I think are missing a vital point. They want
<BR>
blanket &quot;punishments&quot; for the actions a limited few. As well, it seems
<BR>
they can't see the forest for the trees. They continually point to the
<BR>
weapon as the problem. Some go a bit further and say it's access to the
<BR>
weapon, or accountability of the people/dealers/NRA/parents that give
<BR>
them access to weapons. In actuality it's the mentality/psychological
<BR>
make-up of the person that uses a gun (or any weapon for that matter) to
<BR>
be destructive against another person(s). Oh, to be sure, there are
<BR>
people who ask the question why. But the answer is either too complex or
<BR>
too frightening to understand that very little is done on this front.
<BR>
Too many people are willing to pronounce guns as evil and ignore the
<BR>
fact that there was a person behind that weapon using it for ill. There
<BR>
was a person with a *reason* for using that weapon the way they did.
<BR>
That is where the issue lies.
<BR>
<P>On a side note, a possible solution for children (say under seven or
<BR>
eight; someone whose reasons are fathomable, it's just that they don't
<BR>
understand consequences yet) having an improbable time of using a gun
<BR>
would be to increase the force required to pull the trigger. Something
<BR>
an adult could easily manage, but would give small fingers no chance at
<BR>
pulling the trigger. Safeties are the first line of defense, and a
<BR>
non-hair-trigger mechanism would be a good back up.
