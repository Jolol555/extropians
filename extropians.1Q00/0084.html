<EM>&gt;	a) up until recently, sex has never been `for fun'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	b) any AI's wasting cycles on `for fun', will be replaced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             by those better able to manage their resources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's possible, indeed likely, that some form of strategic code-swapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will evolve (or be built-into) AI's. Those able to do it sucessfully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will survive. If this forms a vital part of relative AI power, it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be every bit as daunting and enjoyable to AI's as sex is to humans.

Not for FUN?????  Geez!  Have you guys never watched or read anything from 
<BR>
Experimental Psych?  Do you think that the lower animals - or even most 
<BR>
humans throughout history - thought that sex was about procreation or 
<BR>
preserving their genes?
<BR>
<P>What is &quot;fun.&quot;   What is play?   Most of what we or any higher mammal or 
<BR>
bird does is not directly connected with getting food, shelter, air or 
<BR>
progeny.  It's all about information  - specifically feedback.  We and most 
<BR>
of the animals above the level of fish engage in sex as part of a continuum 
<BR>
of self-actualization and feedback.  We NEED to see who we are and how we 
<BR>
relate to the world.  We get this from doing things or attempting to do 
<BR>
things - especially novel and risky things.
<BR>
We get the parts of this that relate directly to our identity as a member of 
<BR>
a species via relations with others of our species who percieve us and react 
<BR>
accordingly - as in play, where we learn to refine those types of 
<BR>
perception.  Sex is merely one of the extreme forms of this.
<BR>
Orgasm is NOT a matter of 0.8 second contractions, which are specific to 
<BR>
humans, BTW, and thus cannot possibly be a defining element, as many, many 
<BR>
other species have orgasms.  Orgasms are a system function, as when the 
<BR>
perceptions of oneself - not the phsical mirror image, but who we really are 
<BR>
as a person or animal - are fed back purely and directly via the reactions 
<BR>
of another consciousness - or via masturbation, which reinforces the same 
<BR>
point.
