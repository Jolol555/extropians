<P>
On identifying threats to transhumanism....
<BR>
<P>I think what might be useful is to identify words and deeds which run counter 
<BR>
to transhumanist principles, and practice engagement, such as in debates and 
<BR>
other forums, so as to stand up and say, &quot;This is what I believe to be right, 
<BR>
and let me tell you why.&quot;  I hope we can seek out all ideas and activities 
<BR>
which seem counter to transhumanism, and not let them go unopposed.  
<BR>
Remember, transhumanism is really just technologically optimistic and reason 
<BR>
based humanism.  If someone is starting to support fear, ignorance, 
<BR>
persecution, oppression, and stifling the &quot;human&quot; spirit, I want to know 
<BR>
about it soonest, and not let their voice grow to be the only one heard, 
<BR>
because they have muzzled others.
<BR>
<P>Having said all this, we must be as careful in our means as in our goals.  
<BR>
Our methods should be those which remain true to transhumanism; persuasion 
<BR>
through logic, reason, openess, truth, knowledge, optimism, tolerance, 
<BR>
non-coercion, creativity, and empathy.  I would add that we do this not just 
<BR>
for ourselves, but for all people, including those that might harm us.  
<BR>
Transhumanism is not just for an elite few, it is for everyone.  If people 
<BR>
choose to reject the principles of transhumanism after we have done our best 
<BR>
to show them why we believe and live by transhumanist values, that is their 
<BR>
right, but let us shine a light on intolerance, irrationality, and fear so 
<BR>
that they do not end up being offered as the only way.
<BR>
<P>I always view an &quot;enemy&quot; as someone who could become a friend.
<BR>
