Given a contest between the 1 million armed infantry soldiers the US Govt 
<BR>
could field if it called up all National Guard and reserve units, and the 80 
<BR>
million gun owning individuals and/or households, I would bet on the people.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is an interesting subject to consider and not just for the U.S. but 
<BR>
other nations.  If a U.S. president or general were to make a 'bid for 
<BR>
dictatorship' for whatever reason, first of all I don't see all or even many 
<BR>
of U.S. troops following them.  With perhaps the exception of some sort of 
<BR>
major national disaster.  But then many troops would want to go home and 
<BR>
watch out for their families.
<BR>
<P>But please keep this in mind.  If not in the U.S. (and it could) then 
<BR>
elsewhere, a military can terrorize and keep under control a much larger 
<BR>
general population.  Mobile and highly trained units of various types could 
<BR>
be kept on standby to strike at population centers that get out of hand for 
<BR>
local police.  A government that does not care about casualties (and the 
<BR>
populace knows this) could be held in check by the fear of facing these 
<BR>
forces.
<BR>
<P>In your scenario the whole nation is up in arms against the unlawful use of 
<BR>
military force.  In this case even our military would have a nearly 
<BR>
impossible time, even if it were loyal to some maniac (highly unlikely).  
<BR>
But if a initial act of terror cowed the general populace into submission, 
<BR>
then with mobile and heavily armed forces you can keep the populace in line 
<BR>
and defeat what generally weak resistance will come.  Mechanized infantry 
<BR>
backed by air support would mop the floor with a group of untrained 
<BR>
civilians trying to put up a fight.
<BR>
<P>But of course when you have guerilla warfare going on then it is much harder 
<BR>
for a military to focus its power on anything substantial.  I am thinking of 
<BR>
insurgencies in places like Latin America.  I hope we never witness such 
<BR>
things in the United States.  I remember hearing a reporter once say how he 
<BR>
found it amazing after having travelled the world, that the U.S. could have 
<BR>
transfers of power without armed revolution and tanks surrounding the White 
<BR>
House.
<BR>

<BR>
