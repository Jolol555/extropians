Hey, you're absolutely right! So, next time I get the urge to `play God', 
<BR>
here's my plan:
<BR>
<P>I'm going to kidnap some small children and hide them in a cellar they can't 
<BR>
escape from. They'll never see me, but they'll be able to shout to each 
<BR>
other through small holes. Then I'll randomly torment and amuse them, making 
<BR>
sure they can hear each others' screams. After a few years, I'll let them 
<BR>
out, and they can come and play in my garden where I'll make it all up to 
<BR>
them. Assuming any of them are still sane.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>A very bitter allegory.  I remember being taught about having an 'eternal 
<BR>
perspective' in viewing life and it's unfairness.  Definitely easier said 
<BR>
then done.
<BR>
<P>I wish you had a near-death experience to show  that there is a world beyond 
<BR>
the bitterness and unfairness we see in the mortal plane.  I wish I had a 
<BR>
near-death experience to show there is a world beyond this one of bitterness 
<BR>
and unfairness! Lol  I just don't want it to be a &quot;total-death experience&quot;  
<BR>
for either of us, at least not for quite some time! :)
<BR>
<P>I would like to have the experience that some swear are totally real visits 
<BR>
to the next plane of existance and not simply the actions of a dying brain 
<BR>
providing a comforting exit to oblivion.   I wish I had such an experience 
<BR>
to draw strength from.  A women who had  experienced a near-death experience 
<BR>
said, &quot;some conjecture and then some simply know!&quot;  In time, as Max More 
<BR>
indicated in a past post, some of us may wind up dying whether we like it or 
<BR>
not.  Ready for the ultimate next frontier?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
