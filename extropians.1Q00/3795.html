<P>
I was thinking recently about neural nets and memes...
<BR>
specifically, I was thinking that a sort of shoddy
<BR>
analogy might be drawn to the way a particular
<BR>
&quot;neuron&quot; in a neural net functions, with the state of
<BR>
it's inputs determining it's outputs, to the way a
<BR>
particular mind in a sort of memetic pool... *mutters*
<BR>
I know, I know, I've used the word &quot;Meme&quot; twice in
<BR>
here... I'll probably get half a dozen complaints from
<BR>
one person or another on that account due to the fact
<BR>
that some people hate the concept, some love it, some
<BR>
think it entirely unrelated to reality... but it's
<BR>
short for, in this case, information transmitted from
<BR>
person to person that stays the same on some basic
<BR>
point, or rather these points which remain the same...
<BR>
*coughs* anyhow...
<BR>
to the way a particular mind in the global memetic
<BR>
pool tends to accept or reject ideas or beleifs based
<BR>
on the previous ideas or beleifs which have been
<BR>
absorbed... like as if you took a neural net and gave
<BR>
each neuron a self aware history file and some kind of
<BR>
bizarre algorhythm to solve for truth or falsehood (on
<BR>
or off? 1 or 0?) based on all of the inputs that it
<BR>
had previously received.... it sounds a little like
<BR>
some of the things Turing was proposing for AI....
<BR>
anyways... my idea being... doesn't this sound almost
<BR>
like a giant, multiphase net of some kind?  Obviously,
<BR>
in the world of ideas, it does seem that there is more
<BR>
than just accept and deny... there is, at the very
<BR>
least, the simultaneous state of pass on or do not
<BR>
pass on for whatever idea has been accepted.  Or
<BR>
perhaps remember strongly or forget, or half-phase,
<BR>
where the idea sits there and bugs a person, and
<BR>
they're not sure if it's true or false or some
<BR>
intermediate state... it sounds rather complex, I
<BR>
suppose, but it struck me that human information
<BR>
transmission is a lot like the neurons of a brain,
<BR>
only larger.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking further on this point, I figured that
<BR>
whatever sort of brain was needed, it would probably
<BR>
not need to be incredibly smart... in this particular
<BR>
case, it's a &quot;human species&quot; metabrain... it might be
<BR>
that all of life on earth transmits information to
<BR>
some degree, or what have you... but anyways... that
<BR>
this brain only needed to know a few things in the
<BR>
case of humans:
<BR>
how to get food to the parts that required it.
<BR>
how to defend from outside forces.
<BR>
since any individual mind is capable of small scale
<BR>
solutions, it would be up to the larger metabrain to
<BR>
be able to get the information where it needed to
<BR>
go... by word of mouth or whatever, the sections of
<BR>
the metamind would correlate, a supraidea would be
<BR>
formed, and sally struthers would suddenly be doing tv
<BR>
spots for starving countries.  Of course, there are
<BR>
other factors involved, one might say.  It was....
<BR>
say, the pity we had on that country... the actions on
<BR>
the parts of individuals hearing the plight, not some
<BR>
mass movement or idea within a giant supramind... (I'm
<BR>
changing my terms at random to see which one sounds
<BR>
nicest)... but isn't it all the same?  It's just...
<BR>
I think I'm introducing a paradigm more than something
<BR>
concrete... generally that's how it is with a lot of
<BR>
philosophical structures, it's more of a way of
<BR>
looking at things than anything that's truly concrete.
<BR>
&nbsp;Some people might, upon reading this, refer me to
<BR>
Lewis Thomas' The Lives of a Cell... and if not, I
<BR>
refer *them*, because it's a wonderful book... but
<BR>
anyways, I think it was more focused on how the planet
<BR>
as a whole is like one interactive lifeform as to a
<BR>
colony of ants... my thought is, the planet as a whole
<BR>
is a lot more like a mind.
<BR>
Which brings me back to my main bit, which isn't quite
<BR>
over yet... if the planet is like a mind, then this is
<BR>
the only mind that has ever existed where the
<BR>
individual neurons evolve... it's analogously a higher
<BR>
lifeform than we are... this thing adapts a great deal
<BR>
without dying... *mutters* here I am, publishing
<BR>
thoughts about &quot;focus&quot; and I get off the subject...
<BR>
what I'm trying to say is...
<BR>
remember Seti@home?
<BR>
we've got one of the largest computers in the world at
<BR>
our fingertips... six billion individual nodes of a
<BR>
giant computer, which resides partly digitally, partly
<BR>
written, partly transferred by word of mouth or hand
<BR>
gesture, and partly in another sort of system
<BR>
altogether, carbon based and using billions of
<BR>
individual neurons to operate...
<BR>
what sort of programs might we run?  *shrugs*  I was
<BR>
bugging people in biology today with this idea... it
<BR>
just struck me as sort of neat at the time.
