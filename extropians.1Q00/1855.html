<P><EM>&gt; Is there anything stopping us from making sheets of rectennae (I gather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is a rectifying antenna, but I'm not sure) that were designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pick up wavelengths in the visible spectrum? These would have to be mighty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small antennae, so we would have to build them with chip fabrication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; techniques or even nanotech, but they should be highly efficient and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very long lasting solar cells shouldn't they? What technological barriers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are currently preventing us from trying this out?
</EM><BR>
<P>One of our physics experts might comment in more detail, but I'll offer
<BR>
my 2 cents. In radio, I believe that the energy is used to induce current
<BR>
flow in the antenna (thus leading to the rectenna idea when you prevent
<BR>
the current from oscillating).  Now in the infrared range the energy
<BR>
primarily contributes to atomic motion (heat) which I suppose in theory
<BR>
could be harvested via standard &quot;Carnot/steam cycle&quot; methods.  Once you
<BR>
get up into the visible range the photons knock the electrons from
<BR>
the valence band up to the conduction band where you can use them
<BR>
for current circulation.  So the trick in solar cell engineering is
<BR>
one of matching the valence-to-current band-gap to the energy of the
<BR>
incoming photons.  Silicon does well for IR and red, GaAs or InP are
<BR>
better for visible frequencies, CdS is even better still.  Multi-layered
<BR>
cells of different materials (and therefore different band-gaps) selectively
<BR>
absorb photons of different energies and can push the efficiencies up
<BR>
to 30% or so, though most current home systems are stuck between
<BR>
10 and 15%.
<BR>
<P>To my mind, normal solar cells are &quot;rectennas&quot; for visible light.
<BR>
<P>There is a descriptive and methodological shift that occurs going
<BR>
from more wave-like to more particle-like behavior in the radiation
<BR>
when it moves from the very high radio-frequency range into the
<BR>
far infrared range.  So, &quot;rectennas&quot; are an energy collection
<BR>
method that to my knowledge only work for radation in the radio,
<BR>
esp. microwave range.
<BR>
<P>The lifetime of solar cells tends to be determined by temperature
<BR>
stresses and radiation damage.  If you can keep them relatively cool
<BR>
and prevent most of the UV radiation from damaging the crystal structure
<BR>
they should have relatively long lifetimes.  These are engineering
<BR>
problems that are addressed in current manufacturing methods presumably
<BR>
on a cost dependent basis.  The primary barriers are getting the volumes
<BR>
high enough that the R&amp;D and plant construction costs become a much
<BR>
smaller fraction of the sales price.  Why is steel or cement so cheap?
<BR>
Because we use so much of the stuff that we can build really *big*
<BR>
mines, trucks, transport barges, blast furnaces, etc. to move collect
<BR>
the material and move it around.  Once those investments have been
<BR>
made their contribution to the final product costs gets very small.
<BR>
Ultimately you get to the point where most of the cost is the energy
<BR>
that goes into the product, you can see that clearly with aluminium.
<BR>
<P>The energy costs for solar cells are probably of the same
<BR>
order of magnitude as Si for chips, Steel or Aluminium because
<BR>
they all have to be melted at some point.  Aluminium is more
<BR>
expensive, not because its rarer (its actually more common)
<BR>
but because the process of separating it from its bauxite
<BR>
requires more energy.  Silicon is even more common but is
<BR>
typically required at much higher purity, so it too requires
<BR>
more energy to get it to that stage.  However, once the
<BR>
manufacturing methods are perfected, solar cells should be very
<BR>
very cheap because you need only a very thin layer (a few hundred
<BR>
micro-meters) to harvest the electrons.  Since glass is a major
<BR>
component of solar cells (and it has to be melted as well), I
<BR>
would guess that at some point the solar cell manufacturing costs
<BR>
should fall to about the same level as the equivalent area of glass plate. 
<BR>
<P>An interesting exercise (for some ambitious reader) would be to
<BR>
determine the amount of glass plate manufactured, the amount
<BR>
of solar cells manufactured and assuming the solar cell mass
<BR>
is doubling every year (??) while glass plate volumes are
<BR>
growing only a few % every year, when do the volumes become
<BR>
equal?  I would guess the average homeowner would probably
<BR>
install about equal amounts of windows and solar cells
<BR>
so this gives you a good idea of when the costs should be
<BR>
roughly equivalent.  It seems to make sense that if you could
<BR>
design your solar cells as a roll-down window shade that people
<BR>
who don't have anyone at home during the day would want to lower
<BR>
these shades while they are away at work.
<BR>
<P>The only advantage &quot;nano&quot; brings to all of this is some type
<BR>
of self-assembly, so maybe you &quot;paint&quot; the cells onto the
<BR>
outside of your house.  They might also offer 3-4 layer
<BR>
nanostructured materials that might push the efficiencies
<BR>
up a bit (40%+?) and then if they are &quot;active&quot; they might
<BR>
provide self-healing or self-repair to some degree.  And
<BR>
of course if you have your Almost Anything machine (as
<BR>
previously discussed), and the designs, you can program
<BR>
it to make a square foot or so of nano-solar-tile a night,
<BR>
so you can simply go outside and stick it to the side of
<BR>
your house in the morning as you head off to work.
<BR>
<P>The real limit at this point is getting the volumes up,
<BR>
nano makes that really easy but I suspect the volumes
<BR>
will be pretty high before nano arrives.
<BR>
<P>The nice thing in my mind is what a lot of cheap solar power
<BR>
will do for the balance-of-trade deficit.  When electric
<BR>
or fuel cell cars (driven by alcohol produced via solar
<BR>
powered bacteria) are available there then becomes a huge
<BR>
incentive for the U.S., Europe, Australia, etc. to move
<BR>
away from oil.  At that point it seems there would be a
<BR>
huge ROI to the people in a country if the governments
<BR>
pushed the solar cell development hard (through low
<BR>
cost loans, tax incentives, etc.).  It makes a lot more
<BR>
sense to me for the developed countries to be spending
<BR>
their &quot;gas&amp;heating&quot; dollars on the installation of
<BR>
the infrastructure required to give them a relatively
<BR>
&quot;free&quot; energy future.  It would give me a huge amount
<BR>
of satisfaction to fill my car up from the ever replenishing
<BR>
alcohol tank sitting on my roof.
