<P>
'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;This is false.  Transparency is not enough.  You need transparency, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;capacity to recognize wrongdoing, and the capacity to do something about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; None of these requirements seems like much of a hurdle in a transparent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.
</EM><BR>
<P>If a despot is in power and you know it, getting the capacity to do
<BR>
something about it is quite a hurdle indeed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;LOTS of data-crunching, you just forget it's going on.  Can you imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;system like this if it depended on human agents to type in what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cameras were seeing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is that its not going on by *my* machine.  The crunching is being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done on the server.  My box just reads the results to me, no big deal.  As a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result I don't need to invest in a big powerful server to benefit from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data on the web.  Government, with all its fancy shmancy hardware can't do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything on the web I can't do.  This undercuts your &quot;the big guys will make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better use of it so they can crush you&quot; argument.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look, my whole argument is that you can't guarantee yourself access to the
<BR>
server, even if you can assure yourself access to the cameras. Remember,
<BR>
these servers are government owned and government run.  The government can
<BR>
take away the servers, and THEN where would you be?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;You start small and work outwards.  Despotism is a tiring, thankless job,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but at the end of the day, you've got a personal realm of terror that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can call your own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;For the curious, you do it like this:  You seize control of a small area,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  (Whoops!  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cameras aren't lie detectors, are they?)  You seize control of some more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;territory, and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  Repeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Granted, I left out the hard part, which is actually seizing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;territory, but the principle is tried and true.  And unfortunately, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cameras can't detect intentions any better than the modern press.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except that the act of &quot;seizing&quot; *any* territory in the US makes you a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal and the feds will swiftly give you an extra large helping of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Montana Freeman - Branch Davidian treatment.
</EM><BR>
<P>In a democracy, you might run it differently.  Instead of seizing control
<BR>
of &quot;territories,&quot; as such, you start picking off minorities.  This is
<BR>
legal in a democracy, and while it might be looked at askance, no one is
<BR>
going to run over and attack you simply because your state has done
<BR>
something offensive to a minority.  The most vivid example we have of a
<BR>
despot rising to power where there was once a democracy was Hitler.  If
<BR>
you wanted to be a despot in America, you'd do it the way he did it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;As if all you needed were numbers.  You need weapons, too.  And you need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to organize.  But if you try to get a weapon, the henchmen will know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;instantly, and shoot you.  And if you try to organize, before you get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;chance, the government will know instantly, and shoot you.  THAT'S how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;picture looks when transparency goes both ways but only one side has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;physical force and the computing power on its side.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK now look at it this way, for all the reasons you just said it would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to overthrow a despot if he had access to ubiquitous surveillance. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   For all those same reasons, it would be just as hard (if not harder) for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the despot to take over in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if the despot manages to get a mandate from the people first.  Hitler,
<BR>
you'll recall, had the popular vote.  How would a transparent society have
<BR>
prevented Hitler from rising to power?
