</EM><BR>
almost no one does this.
<BR>
<P>I do. (Sort of.) And this isn't a poor country. But I `pay the locals' more
<BR>
like $10K a year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;2) You could now save a huge fraction (&gt;50%?) by buying simple standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;items [...]rather than getting[...]sales folks to advise you about things.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;Few people
<BR>
<EM>&gt;do this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do (in effect). With the surly sales staff you get in many Australian
<BR>
shops, who'd notice the difference? :)
<BR>
Does this mean my vision is warped or am I a frontrunner?
<BR>
<P>Then it gets down to detail, and one needs to specify the kinds of nano
<BR>
minting and AI under discussion. I suppose I had in mind a sort of generic
<BR>
2025/2030, pre-singularity (assuming one can stave it off for five minutes,
<BR>
pace Eliezer) but with fairly smart AI agents and freely available matter
<BR>
compilation systems of various dimensions, some for home use, some held by
<BR>
the community (so you need to book in):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;3) Services include insurance, stock markets, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Mostly done on the net with smart systems?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;fast food, 
</EM><BR>
<P>What, pop into the Golden Arches to have *them* compile a burger for you?
<BR>
There'll still be places to meet and hang out, but maybe no food is faster
<BR>
and easier than stuff out of a `replicator'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;education,
</EM><BR>
<P>Universities and other high-level teaching and related research, okay. But
<BR>
lots of local-level AI-assisted teaching at home or community level, I'd
<BR>
expect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;telecom, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Surely most of this will be automated?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;security, hotels, movies, doctors, lawyers, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair enough, but again much of these skills might be handed off to expert
<BR>
systems and fun-seeking, hard-working self-important amateurs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;car repair, ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Throw the clunker in the goop pool and pull out a new one in the morning...
<BR>
<P>I'm probably being way too glib in these remarks, and confusing decades.
<BR>
But I still suspect there's something radically disruptive in this
<BR>
perspective.
