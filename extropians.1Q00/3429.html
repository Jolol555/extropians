Message #13281
<BR>
Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2000 12:11:02 -0500 (EST)

From: Charles Platt &lt;<A HREF="mailto:cp@sedona.net?Subject=Re:%20Charles%20Platt%20responds%20to%20Billy%20Brown%20on%20CryoNet%20Message%20#13281&In-Reply-To=&lt;14516.18315.626251.827588@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">cp@sedona.net</A>&gt;

Subject: Billy Brown
<BR>
<P>Extropian Billy Brown seems to have a very odd, and misleading, view of
<BR>
mortality. I'm glad his statement was posted here, since it provides such
<BR>
as classic illustration of everything that's wrong with cryonics, and
<BR>
helps to explain why there may not be any meaningful cryonics services at
<BR>
all, another decade from now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'd go a lot further than this.  First off, accidents that destroy the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are fairly rare, so even if you die young your odds of getting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;halfway-decent suspension are pretty good.  It is pretty hard to die in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;way that prevents your body from arriving at a hospital within an hour or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;less - just don't get yourself killed while you're off camping in the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>What do you mean by &quot;rare&quot;? Old people frequently die alone (at least one,
<BR>
in the past five years, was a cryonics case, not discovered until much
<BR>
time had elapsed). Cases of accidental death are usually autopsied, which
<BR>
usually means a delay of more than a day. If you are far from a cryonics
<BR>
facility and death occurs quickly, the team may take time to reach you.
<BR>
Even if you are in an ideal situation, with team members beside the bed
<BR>
waiting, brain damage can occur (and probably often does) while you are
<BR>
still alive--as a result of diminishing oxygen supply to the brain, as
<BR>
described in detail elsewhere by Mike Darwin. Many forms of injury and
<BR>
disease affect the brain (as Thomas Donaldson can tell you, and so could
<BR>
Jim Glennie, if he were still alive). To say that your chances of a
<BR>
&quot;halfway decent suspension&quot; are &quot;pretty good&quot; is asinine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Remember, if cryonics patients are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ever revived at all, that means we're positing nanotech advanced enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;repair any kind of physical damage.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Totally wrong. The objective of the cryopreservation research that has
<BR>
been reported here and elsewhere is to enable resuscitation without need
<BR>
for cell-by-cell repairs. And the phrase &quot;nanotech advanced enough to
<BR>
repair ANY kind of physical damage&quot; is just plain dumb. Obviously some
<BR>
forms of damage will be relatively easy to repair, while others will be
<BR>
difficult or impossible using any imaginable technology. The process of
<BR>
reconstructing a 3-D jigsaw puzzle involving billions of fragments will be
<BR>
nontrivial.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;original information content of a scrambled brain is isomorphic to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;problem of deducing the information content of an encrypted message.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another gross oversimplification. Totally misleading. I invite you to
<BR>
compare the number of permutations of characters in a linear string with
<BR>
the number of positional permutations in a THREE-dimensional array,
<BR>
especially bearing in mind that the 3-D array can be reconstructed in a
<BR>
vast number of ways that &quot;seem to make sense&quot; but will not constitute the
<BR>
same &quot;message&quot; as the original brain. In other words, there's no way to
<BR>
know whether you put the pieces back where they came from, unless of
<BR>
course you happen to have a convenient record of your neuron structure
<BR>
right now, for reference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;What does this all mean in English?  Basically, that burning your brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;destroys information, but dropping a rock on it doesn't.  Most of the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sources that cryonicists agonize over, like freezing damage and ischemic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;injury, are very regular in nature
</EM><BR>
<P>Clearly, the person reading this has never actually see a single electron
<BR>
micrograph depicting freezing damage, which is about as random as one
<BR>
could hope to find.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;So, your odds of getting an adequate suspension are very high no matter how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you end up dying.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine, Billy. So the bottom line is, you are a member of the Alfred
<BR>
E. Neuman school of cryonics. In response to endless bulletins describing
<BR>
the magnitude and complexity of damage, the risks associated with
<BR>
cryopreservation procedures, the significant unknown factors, and the
<BR>
destructive processes of dying, your response is, &quot;What, me worry?&quot;
<BR>
<P>This attitude, I believe, has been largely responsible for the gradual
<BR>
decline in cryonics capabilities during the past fifteen years. Drexler's
<BR>
great work, THE ENGINES OF CREATION, was once thought to be a tremendous
<BR>
help to the cryonics movement (see Mike Darwin's initial, lyrical review
<BR>
in CRYONICS magazine). In fact, while I do consider it one of the most
<BR>
important books of the last few decades, it has been a disaster for
<BR>
cryonics. Prior to this book, when someone signed up for cryonics, they
<BR>
saw a desperate need to do something to improve our capabilities. Now,
<BR>
most likely, they share Billy Brown's airy optimism, and do nothing of any
<BR>
practical value. This explains why cryonics organizations today are led by
<BR>
aging people (such as myself) who are getting too old and tired to do the
<BR>
work, while we see a conspicuous lack of younger people willing to put in
<BR>
the hours. Reassured by the Prophet Drexler, they prefer to sit in
<BR>
comfort, swapping messages about their impending immortality, which will
<BR>
of course occur shortly after the impending singularity.
<BR>
<P>Even in their sunny view of the future, though, there is (or should
<BR>
be) some cause for concern. Even if you assume that a &quot;half-way decent
<BR>
suspension&quot; can be nothing more than a bucket of liquid nitrogen, someone
<BR>
has to provide the bucket, and someone has to make sure that it will be
<BR>
topped off for the next few decades. In other words, no matter how sunny
<BR>
your view of the world is, cryonics depends on infrastructure, and
<BR>
infrastructure must be maintained. Since ALL cryonics organizations depend
<BR>
on donations of money, time, and labor, it is grossly misleading to spread
<BR>
the meme that the future is in some sense guaranteed, and all you have to
<BR>
do is pay your insurance and membership dues.
