<EM>&gt; &gt;And doing so is not without cost: medical research on chimps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has made real differences in all our lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suppose it must have made some difference for some lives,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I have doubts that it is much difference for most lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What evidence would you offer for this claim?
</EM><BR>
<P>The Foundation for Biomedical Research &lt;<A HREF="http://www.fbresearch.org">http://www.fbresearch.org</A>&gt;
<BR>
is a good place to start; they are an advocacy group, but they do
<BR>
generally have their facts straight.
<BR>
<P>It is true that most medical research on primates is not done
<BR>
with great apes but rather with monkeys like tamarins and
<BR>
macaques [insert generic &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument here].  It
<BR>
is also true that the number of people who can specifically
<BR>
trace improvements in their lives to specific uses of primate
<BR>
medical research are probably few.  But to judge the true impact
<BR>
of this research, you have to include everyone who might have
<BR>
contracted a disease but for a vaccine tested or researched on
<BR>
apes (AIDS is a major one but not the only), or who had any such
<BR>
ancestor, or who benefited from an advance by one of those people,
<BR>
or who benefited from an advance by someone who was affected by
<BR>
one of those people...
<BR>
<P>Just because I didn't personally directly benefit from some
<BR>
Orangutan on psychotropic drugs or something, I am not willing
<BR>
to overlook the possibility that I owe some significant part of
<BR>
my life to someone who did.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a rationally selfish point of view, the reason I grant
</EM><BR>
rights to people is that interacting with people in an environment
<BR>
of such rights generates advantages for me: specialization, trade,
<BR>
reciprocity, etc.  I live a better life because I choose to support
<BR>
and work within a system of human rights.  When short-term narrow
<BR>
circumstances change that dynamic--such as when I am being robbed
<BR>
at gunpoint--I would not hesitate to sacrifice another human life
<BR>
to save my own because that after all is my final goal: my life.
<BR>
It may be that I can accrue some benefits by supporting a system
<BR>
that grants some such rights to apes.  I can't enumerate them, but
<BR>
nor can I rule them out.  But unless I can justify this grant in
<BR>
selfish terms, I find it difficult to support rationally.
<BR>
