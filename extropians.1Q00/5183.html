<P>
I think that those insistent on fixing a 'problem' that they perceive to exist by
<BR>
passing some laws that confiscate peoples liberties,
<BR>
really ought to just think about things, like this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bread, and why it should be banned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Hazards of Baked Bread...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A recent Cincinnati Enquirer headline read, &quot;SMELL OF BAKED BREAD MAY BE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HEALTH HAZARD.&quot;  The article went on to describe the dangers of the smell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of baking bread.  The main danger, apparently, is that the organic components
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this aroma may break down ozone (I'm not making this stuff up).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was horrified.  When are we going to do something about bread-induced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; global warming?  Sure, we attack tobacco companies, but when is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government going to go after Big Bread?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I've done a little research, and what I've discovered should make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone think twice ....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1: More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread eaters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2: Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; score below average on standardized tests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3: In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typhoid, yellow fever and influenza ravaged whole nations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4: More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eating bread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5: Bread is made from a substance called &quot;dough.&quot;  It has been proven that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as little as one pound of dough can be used to suffocate a mouse. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average American eats more bread than that in one month!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6: Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low occurrence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7: Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given only water to eat, actually begged for bread after only two days.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 8: Bread is often a &quot;gateway&quot; food item, leading the user to harder items
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as butter, jelly, peanut butter and even cold cuts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 9: Bread has been proven to absorb water.  Since the human body is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bread-pudding person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10: Newborn babies can choke on bread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 11: Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 12: Most American bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In light of these frightening statistics, we propose the following bread
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrictions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   1: No sale of bread to minors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   2: No advertising of bread within 1000 feet of a school.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   3: A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the societal ills
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   we might associate with bread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   4: No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may appeal to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   children) may be used to promote bread usage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   5: A $4.2 zillion fine on the three biggest bread manufacturers. Please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   send this e-mail on to everyone you know who cares about this crucial issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember: Think globally, act idiotically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
