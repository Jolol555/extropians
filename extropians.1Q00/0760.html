<P><EM>&gt; Maybe we should really be thankful for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  distribution of land masses enabling sufficient cultural and resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  diversity to allow a globally exponential technological development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  over a long time. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Maybe the time to start worrying is now, when we are racing towards a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  situation where cultural factors can influence technology globally...
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an EXTREMELY insightful question and points to the issue of how far 
<BR>
we can push the metaphor of &quot;memes&quot;: If we are truly moving to a &quot;memetic 
<BR>
monoculture&quot;, we may well face some new dangers that could threaten the pace 
<BR>
of innovation.  It is the ultimate irony of classical liberalism: No matter 
<BR>
how right we think we are, we must hope that not everyone agrees!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Perhaps we can speed up or slow down progress (or even stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; it).  How would we do this?  If by supression then we imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; that technology is an independent force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Suppose everybody thinks that it is pointless to develop new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  computers. There might be some tinkerers doing it anyway, but there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  no market demand so they will not be rewarded. After a while, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  everybody is using the same old systems, even a radically better new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  system would have a hard time finding good applications because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  everybody is using the same old applications with no need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  change.
</EM><BR>
<P>This reminds me of a term once applied (by whom, I can't recall, dammit!) to 
<BR>
China's long, long periods of cultural stability: A &quot;high-level equilibrium 
<BR>
trap&quot;.  This idea posits that when almost EVERYTHING people do or want in a 
<BR>
society is addressed at least fairly well by some technology or custom or 
<BR>
social relationship, all of which are intricately interwoven, there is a 
<BR>
strong pressure to avoid innovation.  Like so many Westerners drawn to study 
<BR>
Chinese history, it was the question of why China avoided innovation for so 
<BR>
long that drew me most strongly to take a degree in the subject when I was 
<BR>
but a pup.  Ethnocentric and &quot;chronocentric&quot; faith in the inevitability of 
<BR>
progress on short time scales is one of the great dangers of people familiar 
<BR>
only with modern Euro-American history . . .
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Note that I'm not saying they are perfectly stable - they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  probably change with time, and even stagnant societies can revive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  quite a bit. But it is not because technology wills it, it is because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of an interplay of cultural factors (like changes in politics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  religion, writing, new ideas or inefficiency), outside factors (trade,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  competition, changing neighbors) and hard to predict individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  factors like lone geniuses, great accidents, nutty emperors or random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  chance.
</EM><BR>
<P>An excellent summation of the myriad of factors that bore on the end of 
<BR>
China's long cultural stagnation in its &quot;high-level equilibrium trap&quot; from 
<BR>
the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. 
<BR>
<P>(With such great insight into the humanities from a scientist like Anders, I 
<BR>
fear I shall have to study some more mathematics to be of any value here . . 
<BR>
.)
