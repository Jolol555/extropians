<EM>&gt; You are big boys and girls already, you should not

<EM>&gt; parents anymore with printed word &quot;sex&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<P>*ahem* I don't know about everyone else on this list,
<BR>
but I'm fourteen and five feet short.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;And you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brought up your own kids to be free (otherwise, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did you produce them?). 
</EM><BR>
I didn't know people produced children; I thought they
<BR>
gave birth to them.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And you should program the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filter to recognize the extropian list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And prepare to exhibit a lot more courage than this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever want to get anywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Will you hide all the hedonic body mods, uploading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the other stuff, from your conservative moms, kids,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and neighbors?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or do you expect that someone else will work to flex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worldviews?  Who exactly do you think it should be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or you want your parents (and kids?) to die before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speak freely?   And are you sure that your *kids*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the topic of sex?  Or maybe, it's you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
You do have a point; however, I think perhaps that you
<BR>
haven't seen all sides of the argument before stating
<BR>
your opinion, and your method of stating it was more
<BR>
than a little accusatory.
<BR>
<P>It is pretty much naturally engrained into parents
<BR>
that they need to protect their children from certain
<BR>
things, sex being one of them. It is a social thing
<BR>
more than a natural thing, I think, but one that is
<BR>
none the less very present. I know; often enough I see
<BR>
my parents hastily switching channels when my little
<BR>
sister enters the room. 
<BR>
<P>Sex is a fact of life. Not everybody does it, but
<BR>
everybody has one (or more!). It is inescapeable in
<BR>
society because of procreation being the one of the
<BR>
main drives of our species. However, many adults, and
<BR>
teenagers, feel that it is being introduced far too
<BR>
early. I admit I'm one of them; I know
<BR>
fifteen-year-olds who know more about copulation then
<BR>
some adults. It is understandable why many parents
<BR>
seek to shield their children from that situation for
<BR>
as long as possible, although it doesn't always work
<BR>
and kids generally realise what its all about by the
<BR>
time they're twelve, although they don't always
<BR>
generate an interest in it then. 
<BR>
<P>In some societies sex is perfectly acceptable when
<BR>
introduced to the younger generations, and is indeed
<BR>
an important part of culture; however, there are many
<BR>
societies where that is not so, and it is generally 
<BR>
deemed unhealthy for the younger generations to be
<BR>
introduced to the concepts. people also seem afraid
<BR>
that teenagers will overeact to any kind of sexual
<BR>
stuff and attempt to gorge on it. Their opinion may be
<BR>
right on some accounts, but it is also wrong on
<BR>
others; I've seen naked people before (on tv), the
<BR>
majority of my sex education coming from Monty
<BR>
Python's the Life of Bryan....and my general reaction
<BR>
is comparable to this:
<BR>
&quot;oh, is that what a naked male looks like? Hm. Ah! I
<BR>
have a book on black holes in from the library...I
<BR>
should go check it out...I wonder if there's anything
<BR>
good on philosophy...hm...have I called Skye yet
<BR>
today? We should probably get together this weekend
<BR>
and work on the computer...or write something...oh, I
<BR>
have a book plot...&quot; Only much more complex. And
<BR>
jumbled.
<BR>
<P>But that's just me; I can't derive the entire
<BR>
population from myself and a few friends. Continuing
<BR>
onward...I seem to have lost the brunt of my rant.
<BR>
Which is probably as well, considering that I'm mostly
<BR>
repeating myself. So, before I add another six or
<BR>
seven hundred words to this, good night, or good
<BR>
morning, or somewhat inbetween, whatever the case may
<BR>
be.
