<EM>&gt;From: &quot;john grigg&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20near-anything%20boxes%20allowed%20to%20be%20in%20the%20hands%20of%20the%20public?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000308044341.57706.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">starman125@hotmail.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;A very bright but criminally minded individual or group might be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hack into the safeguards so they could create whatever they pleased,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;including antrax.  Even the best defenses can be overcome by those with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brains, education, time and money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I could really see the federal government feeling that near-anything boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in homes would be somewhat like letting citizens have their own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nukes.  Once there is even one major incident/scare the gov't would move in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a way that would make the gun control issue look minor by comparison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the name of public safety and national security, we may never be allowed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these replicators within our homes in the first place.  The gov't and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporate powers may say, &quot;come to us, and for a &quot;nominal&quot; charge we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;create what you want.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Underground groups would have massive federal resources allocated against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them, to put them behind bars.  The hacker hunts would pale by comparison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nano would be used to violate civil liberties that would be reminiscient of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the war on drugs but more clandestine and for that reason even more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;threatening to people's rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My hope is that home nanoreplicator technology will develop very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incrementally and we will see it gain a foothold in the private citizen's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realm that will not be possible to reverse.  May corporate greed and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forces of capitalism triumph in this area!  So we will see a nanoreplicator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and then eventually a near-anything box in every home! LOL!  With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capitalistic inducements, proper safeguards and no individual or group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overcoming them to do something really vicious as an excuse for the gov't,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we may see our dreams come true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sincerely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;John Grigg
</EM><BR>
<P>Come to think of it, I don't want you to have a near-anything box.  Who's to 
<BR>
say you won't make assisation nano-bots to resolve a personal dispute 
<BR>
between us?  Or perhaps you join a doomsday cult and your &quot;god&quot; commands you 
<BR>
to set nerve gas loose in my neighborhood.  To be honest, I don't (yet) 
<BR>
trust my fellow man enough to give him almost unlimited power to create 
<BR>
whatever his heart desires in the privacy of his own home.
<BR>
<P>Maybe its a good idea for the government to restrict access to this tech 
<BR>
until we have evolved to the place where we as a species are a lot more 
<BR>
trustworthy.  I'm afraid that may not happen until after some nano-disaster 
<BR>
makes us realize finally that we either love and live together or we don't 
<BR>
and become extinct together.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;
