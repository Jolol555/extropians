<A HREF="mailto:QueeneMUSE@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20WWW%20representation%20of%20Real%20World?%20(I%20hope%20not%20too)&In-Reply-To=&lt;389C979A.335F295D@ibm.net&gt;">QueeneMUSE@aol.com</A> asked:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there good reason to be arrogant on the net and not in person, when you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are ashamed of that behavior?
</EM><BR>
<P>Heres a different spin: the reason is because... *we dont really have a
<BR>
choice!*   We really *cant* be exactly the same in the flesh as we are
<BR>
online, because of deep seated social programming since the time we
<BR>
were zero to *be nice* and pleasant.  Thats just what we do.  It
<BR>
would be damn hard to overpower those instincts, and furthermore,
<BR>
its a good thing.
<BR>
<P>Consider: suppose Queene, you and I met at one of Natasha's lovely
<BR>
gatherings and I acted or said some goofy thing like what I sometimes
<BR>
write online, something that *if you read online* in the safety of your own
<BR>
home, you wouldnt think anything about.  Suppose I said, &quot;Hey, that
<BR>
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Id like to finger her wattle.&quot;   You, sitting
<BR>
there now, safe and alone, might just laugh or say &quot;Silly person.&quot;  If
<BR>
we were face to face and I said that, you might be thinking &quot;Uh oh,
<BR>
if he comes another step closer, Ill kick for the groin, scream and run
<BR>
for that exit...&quot;
<BR>
<P>My point:  online behaviour should be *allowed* and *expected* to be
<BR>
a bit wackier, more open, more expressive, more free of the societal
<BR>
taboos we have all been carefully programmed to observe.  It isnt just
<BR>
freedom to be arrogant: one is freer online to lavish inappropriate
<BR>
complements and blatant flattery.  Its all part of the fun of it.  We
<BR>
cannot and should not even *try* to match in the flesh our online
<BR>
personalities.  spike
