Name three.

There are very, very few people out there who get up in the morning and say 
<BR>
to themselves:  &quot;Today, I will do my best to make the world a more miserable 
<BR>
place.&quot;  I can see all kinds of powerful interests opposed to individual 
<BR>
changes of the type I predict, and powerful interests opposed to any sort of 
<BR>
massive change in the workplace, but without exception, they will *not* see 
<BR>
themselves as working to stop &quot;prosperity&quot; or &quot;personal freedom&quot;.Of course, 
<BR>
I could be wrong.

<P>Eliezer, I would say that there are people out there who get up in the 
<BR>
morning and with their morning coffee think, &quot;I will do whatever it takes to 
<BR>
preserve my interests and the present power structure!&quot;.  Even if they do 
<BR>
not see themselves as against prosperity and personal freedom for the 
<BR>
masses, they actually may be.
<BR>
<P>Of course, your point is well taken that the &quot;powers that be&quot; will most 
<BR>
likely be opposed to a nanotech transformation of society in the narrow 
<BR>
focus in which their individual authority and interest lies.
<BR>
<P>I would like to think there will not be an X-files like, &quot;shadow conspiracy&quot; 
<BR>
to pull the strings from behind the scenes!  Again, I could see 
<BR>
&quot;near-anything boxes&quot; being owned and used only by licensed government and 
<BR>
corporate powers in the name of protection from accidents and terrorism.
<BR>
<P>This would be done in the name of the current trend in law enforcement that 
<BR>
infringes on personal liberties for &quot;the common good.&quot;  This would make it 
<BR>
that much harder to have the raw freedom to pursue one's interests by having 
<BR>
one's own box.  By not having them directly in the public's hands, the 
<BR>
government and corporate sector are much better able to regulate things and 
<BR>
maintain to at least a certain extent the status quo.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
