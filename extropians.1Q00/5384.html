<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right, that is *not* imperialism.  Imperialism is extending a nation's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;economic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; political hegemony over other nations.  The US is not doing this.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; basically acting as the referee in the world's international wrestling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; matches, and enforcing the rules when we notice low blows.  No, no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; appointed us as the referee, but we're the biggest kid on the block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; assumed the role of shot caller by default.  Maybe its a good thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; its not.  But it is definitely *not* imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I sincerely wish the U.S., was doing what you say, but unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the U.S. is still a very imperialist and interventionist country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with this discussion, perhaps, is carelessness with terminology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I agree 100% that the US is &quot;interventionist.&quot;  I don't think *anyone*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; denies that.  But &quot;interventionism&quot; and &quot;imperialism&quot; are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interchangeable terms.  If the thrust of your position is that the US should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let the pendulum swing back a bit toward isolationism, I might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily disagree (although I have not fully considered the issue as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has not specifically been raised in this thread).  But regardless of whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not you are a fan of US foreign policy the plain fact is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;imperialism&quot; is an untrue, unfair and perjorative description of US policy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Imperialism is using force to control the internal politics of foreign
<BR>
nations, and to use force to lock out other industrial powers from
<BR>
accessing the resources of those nations. The imperialist is
<BR>
establishing itself as a monopoly customer for the resources, typically
<BR>
raw or refined materials.
<BR>
<P>Many dissidents in foreign nations (typically socialists and/or
<BR>
communists) decry our 'imperialism' when what they are complaining about
<BR>
is their own government accepting foreign aid money in return for
<BR>
support on US foreign policy objectives. All we are doing is applying
<BR>
the principle of the welfare state to foreign policy.
<BR>
Its the fault of those other countries that they can't seem to refuse
<BR>
our money...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But unfortunately when you live in America, you don't get all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about the things that happen in our regions of the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are not actually claiming that non-US citizens are more informed about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US foreign policy than Americans, are you?  If you are, I must beg to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differ.  Freedom of the press is one of our most cherished rights, and our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; press is not shy in the least about putting Government policy (foreign or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise) in a less than flattering light.
</EM><BR>
<P>What he is saying is that US citizens only get the side of the story
<BR>
that either the US gov't and/or the US media wants US citizens to get.
<BR>
It happens a lot within the US enough to beleive that it happens at
<BR>
least as frequently abroad. For example: The Spotted Owl. Anyone who is
<BR>
on the inside of the logging industry in the Northwest US knows that the
<BR>
Spotted Owl story was promulgated by Weyerhauser for the expressed
<BR>
purpose of putting all of the independent logging and mill operations
<BR>
out of business. Since Weyerhauser is the largest land owner in the
<BR>
Northwest, it could afford to set aside habitat area here and there
<BR>
wherever the owl was found. The independents, who owned less land, or
<BR>
who operated on federal land, could not afford this and went under.
<BR>
<P>A foreign example: The CIA backed coup in Honduras in the 50's. The CIA
<BR>
controlled the acces the reporters it shipped in had to the public and
<BR>
events. Kept them supplied with booze and food, and got the stories it
<BR>
wanted published in the US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Speaking of my country (Mexico)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Although after the end of the usa/Mexico war when we lost more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;half our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;territory the usa has never invaded or threatened us militarily,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they've forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;us to do what they think it's better using all sorts of resources or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;excuses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is called foreign policy.  It's using your clout (political, economic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or military) to induce your neighbors to act in your best interest.  *Every*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nation does it (or tries, or wants to do it).  But since the US has the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clout it is usually the most successful at having other nations comply with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its wishes.  Again, like it or no, this simply is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;An example of this is the certification measure, here in Mexico every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;time the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;congress up there is deciding if we'll get or not certified. it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;creates a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tension and hurts our relations because it's an unilateral procedure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;U.S. Interests only and not ours, but they still implement it, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;easier to use scape goats and pretend they are combating drug abuse by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;being tough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on poor defenseless countries instead of looking wiser alternatives to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this senseless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;drug war, and I could quote several other examples (operation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;casablanca, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that the U.S. government does to force us their beliefs or systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats what you get when you become dependent on foreign aid money. If
<BR>
you want to do your own thing, we have a right to do what we want with
<BR>
our foreign aid money, including sending it to somebody else who is
<BR>
willing to fall in line with our government's &quot;need&quot; to combat the drug
<BR>
trade.
<BR>
<P>The fact is that the Mexican government IS a very corrupt government,
<BR>
from top to bottom. Most governments have a for the most part honest
<BR>
organization of public servants, where only the elected officials are
<BR>
corrupt, and even then, typically those elected officials are only
<BR>
willing to be corrupted by those interests they already support. The
<BR>
Mexican government is corrupt through its entire structure. Nobody who
<BR>
lives in Mexico can deny this, because they likely have gotten the
<BR>
shakedown for money from police, from government officials whenever
<BR>
permits are needed, etc. The fact that the Mexican oil industry is the
<BR>
only oil producing nation that LOSES money on its oil operations ought
<BR>
to tell you something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;And well to avoid unnecessary rants, I'll just say is not very fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for a country to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;use it's enormous military or economic power to force other countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;do things they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't like, and that in my opinion is... imperialism, call it neo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;imperialism if you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but it still doesn't make it any less worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>Imperialism involves using force to get done what you want done, and
<BR>
locking other industrial powers out of the resources in the nations you
<BR>
have power over. Offering a country aid money in return for help in
<BR>
fulfilling our own foreign policy needs is not imperialism.
