<EM>&gt; &gt;  Several people have written back with the notion that the 3rd World is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  full of potential.  I agree - lots and lots of potential, most of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  world's population, resources, fascinating cultures, and (often) no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  lack of drive on the part of the people.  Anyone who's travelled in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &quot;developing&quot; world has seen this: marketplaces and traffic and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  microbusinesses everywhere. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I just recently had another thought about the potential of the 3rd world. 
<BR>
One of the big drawbacks I've always seen to the idea of flooding the 3rd 
<BR>
world with cheap internet terminals is what it will do to indiginous 
<BR>
cultures. They are already under attack and languages and oral traditions 
<BR>
are being lost. This would accelerate the loss immensely. 
<BR>
<P>Today it occurred to me that the reason that I want to preserve ancient 
<BR>
languages and oral traditions is because I find them *valuable*. And if I
<BR>
find them so, then probably so would others. I wonder if one could set up 
<BR>
some sort of Indiginous Knowledge foundation that would attempt to collect 
<BR>
and record as much of the oral traditions of threatened cultures as 
<BR>
possible, with an eye towards making a profit off of licensing and 
<BR>
publication rights. Does Disney want a new African folk tale to Animate? 
<BR>
We've got them by the bushel. Oh sure, you could go to any number of folk 
<BR>
tale collections, but our Foundation would be able to put it into 
<BR>
perspective for you, let you know of variants, what the symbolism means, 
<BR>
and how it would play with various other cultures on the planet.
<BR>
<P>There just might be a viable business model there. And lest folks think 
<BR>
that we would be exploiting the 3rd world cultures, we would compensate 
<BR>
participating cultures with some sort of equity scheme. We might even pay 
<BR>
authors to produce *new* works in their native languages, since this would 
<BR>
be a valuable way of catching some of the symbolism and story-telling 
<BR>
methodologies inherent in a culture. Yup, the mining might be difficult, 
<BR>
but I think that there's gold there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Huge potential - and yet rarely does anything of consequence.  Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  There's no single answer - resources, education, lots of things have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  been mentioned.   However, there's one thing that's a constant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries: terrible, terrible, short-sighted, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  kleptocratic, nepotistic, dictatorial &gt;government&lt;.   The education 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that's supposed to come from giving whizzy slate computers to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  people, or the rise in property values that might otherwise come from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  buying up seemingly valuable rights-of-way in places like Lagos, can't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  happen if the leaders of the countries won't allow you to do it - or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  worse, will be happy to see the investment, and then will confiscate it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - either overtly, or over time through punitive taxation, extortion, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  all the usual 3rd World means.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with you 100%  I've also traveled in the 3rd World and without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt the governments are the single greatest impediment to development. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is all sadly true. One wonders how the Grameen bank is managing to do 
<BR>
it. I do know that they've had to work their way around tortuous 
<BR>
bureaucrasies, but they've managed to succeed so far. When I try to 
<BR>
imagine ways of getting around government impediments, I get the following 
<BR>
list of (possibly futile) things to try:
<BR>
<P>1) Overt attack and overthrow.
<BR>
2) Covert widespread release of give-away information technology that will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead inevitably to revolution.
<BR>
3) Co-opt the Government by giving free information technology to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elite in such a way as to ensure that their children will be exposed to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other ideas about how to run a country. Then wait a generation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that many revolutionaries and reformers have come from the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elite of their society. Buddha was born wealthy.
<BR>
4) Blindside the Government by getting permission to distribute some sort
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of technology that is obviously of benefit to the elite, but can later
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be used in novel ways to change society. Once they find out about other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible agendas, it may be much too late. This may be difficult since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many 3rd world governments are already paranoid, but it can probably be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done.
<BR>
5) Support and Re-educate. Make yourself indispensible to the government 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while working from within to change the culture. This is very difficult
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since it takes the resources of a government, but the delicate touch of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an expert psychiatrist or sociologist. (Not to mention how hard it is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find people capable of doing the necessary cultural analyses needed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to guide such a project.)
<BR>
6) Support and overthrow. Make yourself so indespensible to the running of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the country that withdrawing your support would lead to the collapse of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the government. Then dictate terms.
<BR>
7) Secretly bribe the uppermost elite. Make it more worth their while to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do things your way than the way they've been doing things.
<BR>
8) Orbital mind-control lasers.
