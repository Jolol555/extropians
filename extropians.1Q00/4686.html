<BR>
at his job.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nevertheless, this behavior continued on the managers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;part, and numerous other people who made huge amounts of money for them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walked out at various times.  Finally, I started walking out.  And suddenly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they started treating me respectfully!  So, I continued that behavior - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walking out for the day and leaving critical projects hanging - and their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behavior got even better!
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a friend who has a remarkable talent for personal effectiveness,
<BR>
stemming first and foremost from a good clear picture of Hobbesian reality
<BR>
in which we all live.  I marvel at the ease and calm deliberation with
<BR>
which he optimizes his control of his personal situation.
<BR>
<P>After graduating from Heald in computer technology, and getting his first
<BR>
job, THE VERY FIRST THING HE DID was start looking for another job, and
<BR>
from that moment on he was NEVER without an alternate position waiting for
<BR>
him should he, at any moment, need to avail himself of it.  Consider the
<BR>
brilliance of this action.  Your bosses have no leverage, if you can leave
<BR>
for a &quot;better&quot; situation at the first sign of &quot;attitude&quot; from someone in
<BR>
what is generally regarded as a position of &quot;greater power&quot;.  Plus, on the
<BR>
instant he had an offer for better money, he would walk into his superior's
<BR>
office and stick it to him: &quot;Match the offer or I'm gone.&quot;  No begging.
<BR>
Just pure, undeniable leverage.
<BR>
<P>He was, and is, always, calm and relaxed, pleasant with others, works the
<BR>
way he wants to, takes lunch for as long as he wants to, etc.  Seeing how
<BR>
easily he has accomplished this, makes me think that the reason more people
<BR>
don't do it is that they believe that being on the short end of the power
<BR>
play is an inescapable feature of being in the lower echelons of the power
<BR>
hierarchy.  They believe it can't be done.
<BR>
<P>It CAN be done, and it's not really that hard, if you know how.
<BR>
<P>As my boy, Ray, has observed.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
