<EM>&gt; And your point ...?

<P>I wasn't trying to chastise you or your contrymen. I did not mean it as a
<BR>
personal attack. I was just making a statement of caution for us all. For your
<BR>
country and mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Clue: I didn't vote for the clowns, but I still have to live with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences of their policies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wish I had the answer for the cure for this and much more but I don't. I'm
<BR>
hoping we can at least gain more individual control in the US over which way the
<BR>
majority truly votes by the implimentation of a popular vote using the internet
<BR>
and hopfully the abolishment or severe modification of the representative system
<BR>
which seems to favor special interest and graft more than it does actually
<BR>
represent the public will.

<P>P.S. Are there many Swayze's in Scotland? I'm told it is the land of my
<BR>
ancestors.
