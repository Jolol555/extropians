A while back we had some discussion of the Doomsday principle, which
<BR>
says that a randomly chosen person is likely to be about halfway in
<BR>
the lifetime of the human race (ordered by birth date), and hence if we
<BR>
think of ourselves as randomly chosen this applies to us.  Given that
<BR>
the human race is growing exponentially, it follows that we likely to
<BR>
be near the end of the human race, chronologically.
<BR>
<P>The same principle applies to other phenomena which have exponential
<BR>
growth, such as fads.  By the time the typical person first hears of them,
<BR>
the fad is likely to have just about run its course.
<BR>
<P>In the case of StockGeneration, although there have apparently been
<BR>
people who invested years ago and made good money, the typical person
<BR>
who invests will be near the end of the curve (assuming rapid growth).
<BR>
That means us.  Now that we have heard of it, the site will probably
<BR>
cease operations before long.
