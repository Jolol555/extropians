<EM>&gt; My question has subtle implications, but as MMB notes, it was an axe-blow.

<P>I was thinking more of an Alexandrian sword, but hey.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  But when the doubtful aspects of the `Oedipal' story are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleared away, we seem to be left with what may be important pointers to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development of the infant in respect of its own body and its early adult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figures.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, it may be so that Freud was &lt;more nearly&gt; right _for some humans
<BR>
but not for all_. Claiming that he was simply projecting is a cheap
<BR>
shot. But OTOH, &quot;Before I tell you if the glass is half empty or half
<BR>
full, *you* tell *me* what's in the glass...&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [Evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggests] that the human being may function in the ways outlined by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanisms of repression and displacement [but] that the theory of dreams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and symbolism will not do, and only contains a part of the truth.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Cf. Lakoff &amp; Johnson's _Philosophy in the Flesh_. If most reasoning
<BR>
overloads (in the software sense) the hunter-gatherer brain in a way
<BR>
resembling what L&amp;J are suggesting, it stands to reason that there might
<BR>
be some useful coincidence that is _not happenstance_ but is nonetheless
<BR>
not &quot;founded&quot; on what is, in all likelihood, just another set of
<BR>
metaphors Freud's hunter-gatherer brain seized upon. &quot;Right, but for the
<BR>
wrong reason.&quot; It's just a story. And we are evolved to like stories a
<BR>
lot as long as they hang together.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; he gives only one chapter (though his tape-transcribed case studies from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the consulting room of the psychiatrist Turquet are certainly corrosive:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `the material is perspective-dependent; and it is self-confirmatory and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore method-dependent to some degree, and hence artefact-infected').
</EM><BR>
<P>A ROAF (Relative of a Friend) was working on a PhD thesis (as far as I
<BR>
know, abandoned) and I never managed to get a copy of the draft. It
<BR>
might be salient. If I have it right, this fellow was intent upon
<BR>
attacking Milgram among others (the famed &quot;Milgram's Eleven&quot; obedient
<BR>
&quot;experimenters&quot; &quot;shocking&quot; &quot;subjects&quot; into &quot;unconsciousness&quot;)--claiming
<BR>
that they couldn't even determine what a _result_ was, let alone what it
<BR>
&quot;meant&quot;--because what they expected would color what they would perceive
<BR>
as behaviors, and motivations, hence as results. The pile of
<BR>
presuppositions is too narrow to support its own weight. Damn, I wish
<BR>
he'd published it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; discourse is in a deep sense unintelligible unless we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept that language has 
</EM><BR>
<P>Insert a variable labeled ...&lt;something going on that's unsaid&gt;  right
<BR>
here, almost certainly true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; an unconscious, and that psychoanalytic methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the most valuable known for `interrogating' that unconscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speech/writing.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that this formulation is highly questionable. I suspect this is
<BR>
just appeal to authority, with Freud taking the place of Aristotle (as
<BR>
in the old chestnut &quot;All Philosophy is merely footnotes to...&quot;). And it
<BR>
does seem to be done with very much of an air of &quot;It goes without
<BR>
saying&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As individuals we are interpellated and produced by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; text, and the text of the world, as we produce it (but there is no `we',
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only subject-positions).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                 But can `language', an abstraction as remote from ontological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instantiation as `the unconscious', `have' anything of the sort?  Thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and speech and writing, in whatever order we chose to list them or place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them in hierarchy, no doubt function at varying levels of accessibility: it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is misleading to reify this truth.  Consider a typical poststructural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formulation, the most famous gnome of Lacan's: the unconscious is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structured like a language.  Two objections are evident.  Firstly, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entire structuralist project from which Lacan's work springboards was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; founded in the grand analogy of all the human sciences with linguistics, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its Saussurean recension.  If by hypothesis everything human is structured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a language it is hardly informative to be told that the unconscious,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too, is among their number.  More precisely, though, it is likely that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypothesis is based on a dubious figure.  The surmise that the unconscious,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conceived as the source of language, is structured like its manifest output
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; draws upon such images of isomorphism as stamp and wax or (at the level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA coding) egg and chicken.  But there are many quite important ways in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which, for example, an ice-cream machine is not like an ice-cream.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this analogical step is so readily taken in the absence of compelling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence in its favour bespeaks the imposition of authority and power, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if these are embodied in hegemonically oppositional figures and texts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the brain and language(s) are very likely part and counterpart--of
<BR>
course the shape of one coevolved with the shape of the other. And the
<BR>
stuff in our brains that processes verbish stuff (&quot;live/happening stuff
<BR>
I can identify and track&quot;) and more-nounish stuff (&quot;dead/standing-still
<BR>
stuff, ditto, plus I can grab it&quot;) probably drives the entire engine of
<BR>
categorization without which ratiocination (even if it's just
<BR>
rearranging one's prejudices--which is widely given out to be sneered at
<BR>
but not at all useless) would--well, it'd be very different if it
<BR>
happened at all. But the axiomaticity of a specific Freudian unconscious
<BR>
is still far from a done deal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; `Say it's Oedipus,' in Deleuze and Guattari's parodic demystification, `or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'll get a slap in the face.'
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep. Watch that last step, it's a doozy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                 A major difficulty for anyone from the `scientific' side of Snow's `two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultures' dichotomy is the disdain which poststructural psychoanalysis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to evince for empirical (and in some cases, as we have seen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical) considerations.  Consider that notable - and quite central -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoretical construct of Lacanian thought, the `mirror stage' of infantile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development.  Raymond Tallis, in the passage below, points up what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surely a fairly obvious pragmatic self-refutation (unless the `stage' is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meant to be taken so loosely as to be no more than a metaphoric heuristic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a misleading one); that this kind of debunking analysis has evidently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had no effect whatsoever on Lacanians I see as paradigmatic of the failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of debate between important current theoretical positions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         As Lemaire expresses it `The Mirror Stage is the advent of coenaesthetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjectivity preceded by the feeling that one's own body is in pieces.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reflection of the body, then, is salutary in that it is unitary and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; localised in time and space.'  Is the reflection of the body that infants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive in the mirror thus unified?  Is not the image very often only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fragmentary, consisting of part of the body - usually face plus or minus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the neck and shoulders?  How often does the child see the whole of its body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the mirror?...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                 If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the theory would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unable to enter language, society or the world at large.  There is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; borne out in practice.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is, I am told, an old Polish expression, which I think might
<BR>
apply: 
<BR>
&quot;...making a shawl out of an old sock.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>MMB
<BR>
<P>Nice ratiocinating with you...
