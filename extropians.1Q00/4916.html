<P><EM>&gt; No question.  I *absolutely* agree with you.  I just figured it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot easier to take the gun out of the psychopath's hand than it would be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the pathology out of his head.  If you think there's a practical way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislate against pathology, count me in, I'm all for it.

<P>Well, clearly the problem of removing guns from a &quot;psychopath's hand&quot; is
<BR>
amazingly difficult to do, as evidenced by the recent threads on this
<BR>
list.  I would venture that it remains to be seen whether or not it is
<BR>
*more* difficult than addressing the underlying causes that precede gun
<BR>
violence against humans.
<BR>
<P>My premise is that guns are just another tool that can be used by
<BR>
someone who wishes to do harm or threaten harm to another. Much like a
<BR>
sword, a baseball bat, a crowbar, or fisticuffs, a gun just happens to
<BR>
be the weapon/tool of choice. I think there are two major events that
<BR>
involve gun usage that has the people who are anti-gun (I use this term
<BR>
loosely) so passionate about restrictions, banning, safety, etc. First,
<BR>
is the use of a gun by a criminal to perform or threaten an injurious
<BR>
act against another. The second is when a person who is naive (usually a
<BR>
child) gets a hold of a gun and uses it on another.
<BR>
<P>The reasons behind the second case occurring seem to involve a lack of
<BR>
education or incapable mental hardware that can not understand the
<BR>
consequences of these actions. These are the cases where it seems likely
<BR>
that safety mechanisms should be targeted. Education can only go so far
<BR>
within the mind sets of these individuals.
<BR>
<P>The first case is much harder to deal with. We can separate these events
<BR>
into a few, related, but different categories. A] Assassination B]
<BR>
Criminal intent (i.e., mugging or robbery) C] Killing spree.  These are
<BR>
by no means exhaustive, but I believe capture the majority of gun
<BR>
deaths/injuries (at least in the US). So, now the question becomes what
<BR>
are the person's reasons for doing the above acts and how can we work to
<BR>
eliminate or &quot;fix&quot; it such that this will not occur?
