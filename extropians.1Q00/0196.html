BOOK REVIEW
<BR>
by Richard M. Ebeling
<BR>
<P>Patterns in the Dark: Understanding Risk and Financial Crisis with
<BR>
Complexity Theory by Edgar E. Peters (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999);
<BR>
222 pages; $39.95.
<BR>
<P>In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, the Austrian school of economics was
<BR>
considered one of the leading contributors to both economic theory and
<BR>
economic policy. The Austrian economists challenged the premises and
<BR>
arguments of the socialists, interventionists, and inflationists of their
<BR>
day. They offered an insightful conception of the free-market economy as a
<BR>
dynamic competitive process that coordinated the actions and activities of
<BR>
multitudes of individuals without central direction. They emphasized the
<BR>
role and importance of the entrepreneur for bringing the forces of supply
<BR>
and demand into balance and generating creativity and innovation throughout
<BR>
the market. And they refined Adam Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot; argument that a
<BR>
market economy, securely based on individual freedom, private property,
<BR>
voluntary agreement, and rule of law, had the ability to create a
<BR>
self-generating &quot;spontaneous order&quot; without any political command or
<BR>
control.
<BR>
<P>During the 25 years after the Second World War, the Austrian contributions
<BR>
were in eclipse owing to the rise and domination of Keynesian economics and
<BR>
of a neoclassical, mainstream economics steeped in the idea of mathematical
<BR>
models for determining the general equilibrium solutions to a complex
<BR>
economic system. The Austrian eclipse was reinforced by the ideological
<BR>
triumph of those who hoped to discover the quantitative methods for planning
<BR>
and manipulating an economy into desired directions through mathematical and
<BR>
statistical techniques.
<BR>
<P>Beginning in the 1970s, the theoretical and factual premises of Keynesian
<BR>
economics were increasingly challenged by a growing number of economists.
<BR>
And mathematical economics has slowly come to be seen as a dead end that
<BR>
neither significantly adds to our knowledge about the workings of an
<BR>
interdependent, complex economic order nor offers a key for predicting
<BR>
future changes in the market.
<BR>
<P>The revival of Austrian economics has received support from unexpected
<BR>
directions in recent years. One of these has come from what is known as
<BR>
&quot;complexity theory.&quot; For example, William A. Sherden, in his book The
<BR>
Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Prediction (1998),
<BR>
says,
<BR>
<P>&quot;Complexity refers to the phenomenon of order emerging from the complex
<BR>
interactions among the components of a system influenced by one or more
<BR>
simple guiding principles. Structures such as an economy emerge out of what
<BR>
would otherwise be anarchy by a process of &quot;self-organization.&quot; Complex
<BR>
systems organize themselves without some form of internal control.... The
<BR>
discovery of self-organization could be attributed to eighteenth-century
<BR>
British economist Adam Smith. Smith reasoned that this &quot;complex stew&quot; of
<BR>
interactions among individuals and businesses pursuing their self-interest
<BR>
would create a functioning economy all by itself, with no one in charge.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Investment strategist Edgar E. Peters makes the subject of complexity
<BR>
theory, Austrian economics, and the market process the central theme of his
<BR>
new book, Patterns in the Dark. As Peters points out, &quot;The Austrians believe
<BR>
that individuals working in their own self-interest will spontaneously
<BR>
self-organize when there is an overlap in goals and knowledge. There is, in
<BR>
fact, a direct correspondence between many concepts developed by the
<BR>
Austrians and those of complexity theory.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Peters goes on to explain.
<BR>
<P>&quot;What makes a social system complex is a loose coupling between individual
<BR>
participants and an increase in the number of possible paths of
<BR>
development.... Complex systems are characterized by global structure and
<BR>
local randomness. The global structure maintains the strength of the whole.
<BR>
The local randomness creates innovation and resilience. In free-market
<BR>
economies, competition is the source of local randomness, and regulation
<BR>
maintains the global structure.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What does Peters mean by &quot;regulation&quot;? He generally means the institutional
<BR>
&quot;rules of the game&quot; within which individuals freely interact and compete
<BR>
with each other: private property, rule of law, enforcement and respect for
<BR>
contract, and individual rights as a basis for freedom.
<BR>
<P>And what makes a complex social system and a free-market order
<BR>
&quot;unpredictable,&quot; he argues, is that there is no way to know all the possible
<BR>
ways individuals will adapt to changing circumstances and how entrepreneurs
<BR>
will creatively imagine new and original ways to react to their competitors
<BR>
or initiate new methods and lines of production. Without such real and
<BR>
radical uncertainty, not open to probabilistic risk analysis, the market
<BR>
economy would not have its large degree of adjustability and adaptability to
<BR>
minor and major shifts in opportunities and conditions. Therefore, a market
<BR>
economy evolves and changes through time in ways that makes its future
<BR>
development fundamentally unpredictable. Peters says,
<BR>
<P>&quot;A free-market economy promotes the trade of goods and services among
<BR>
participants who seek to increase their wealth. The goal of a complex system
<BR>
is not a static &quot;equilibrium.&quot; It is, instead, a dynamic and evolving state
<BR>
that is ever changing, ever creative, but ever stable. The details as to how
<BR>
it achieves this state are never constant. Because a complex system does not
<BR>
need a specific sequence of events to achieve its goal of a stable state, it
<BR>
is resilient despite unexpected changes in its environment, and its
<BR>
creativity adapts.&quot;
