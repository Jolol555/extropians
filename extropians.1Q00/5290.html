For those of you who didn't catch it, the January 2K issue of Scientific
<BR>
American had an interesting article on &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;:
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html</A>
<BR>
The snowball earth events where the CO2 recycler got jammed by the
<BR>
continents clustering around the equator (maybe), causing the earth to go
<BR>
through freezings (-50C) followed by heat waves (+50C) lasting tens of
<BR>
millions of years.  During the ice periods all of the continents and oceans
<BR>
would have been buried in several km of ice.  There is no evaporation
<BR>
from the oceans covered in ice and even if they weren't, the cold would
<BR>
produce low evaporation rates.  Volcanoes spewing out CO2, which accumulates
<BR>
since it isn't washed out by the rain), eventually get the greenhouse running
<BR>
again, but it way overshoots a comfortable temperature.  So you get continual
<BR>
rain and massive erosion as the glaciers melt dumping tons of nutrients
<BR>
from the land into the seas.  Until the continents move away from
<BR>
the equator (where high mountain glaciers are reflecting back valuable
<BR>
solar energy), the cycle repeats.
<BR>
<P>Now, speculative mode...
<BR>
<P>Standard measures of DNA mutation rates as well as geological
<BR>
evidence, put the development of Eukaryotes ~2 billion years ago --
<BR>
about 1400 million years  before the higher life forms gat started
<BR>
(~600 Myr ago). They speculate the stress of repeated Snowball events
<BR>
created many isolated pockets of deep sea vent organisms.  When conditions
<BR>
got mild enough they could get access to sunlight &amp; nutrients,
<BR>
this would allow evolution of new life forms before they got
<BR>
knocked off by the next freezout.  The mixing of genes from
<BR>
widely separated pockets (as they spread out repopulating
<BR>
the unfrozen oceans) would potentially allow for rapid evolution
<BR>
of new life forms.
<BR>
<P>Plus ca change, plus c'est le difference.
<BR>
<P>Since, there was almost 3 times the amount from the start of eukaryotes
<BR>
to the Neoproterozoic glaciation events as from those events till now.
<BR>
That raises the possibility, that complex life could have arisen 2-3 times
<BR>
and have been completely erased by freeze/glacier/thaw/rain/flood cycles.
<BR>
This kind of activity is going to do a pretty good job of removing any large
<BR>
scale fossils we might look for.
<BR>
<P>Though there isn't much geological evidence for this, but that may be
<BR>
because there isn't much crust around that is 0.7-2 billion years old
<BR>
or because geologists don't expect to find complex life in those eras
<BR>
and they haven't gone looking for it.  So there may be a discoveries
<BR>
waiting to happen for the clever person that figures out where to look.
<BR>
<P>Alternatively, and this is perhaps more interesting, if stresses like
<BR>
these are what it takes to get complex life, then the fire &amp; ice
<BR>
planets that have highly eliptical orbits, might evolve complex, and
<BR>
even intelligent life, much quicker than did the Earth.  That would
<BR>
imply that the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; arguments are pretty irrelevant.  (But
<BR>
since the authors aren't biologists they may not discuss it [I've
<BR>
only gotten through the first couple of chapters so far].)
<BR>
<P>I would think the strategies of hibernation, low-temperature
<BR>
antifreeze proteins, etc. combined with DNA preservation strategies
<BR>
found in Deinococcus radiodurans would allow the evolution of species
<BR>
that can tolerate the highly eliptical orbits.  So complex life
<BR>
might be quite abundant.  Those that do get a leg up in such
<BR>
environments are going to be hyper-evolving species compared
<BR>
with the rather pokey rates found on Earth.
<BR>
<P>So we have, yet another area not much thought has been devoted
<BR>
to.  In addition to my favorite, &quot;What are the speed limits on
<BR>
self-replication?&quot;, we now have to add &quot;What are the speed limits
<BR>
on evolution?&quot;.
