<EM>&gt;&gt; I think that the present human species' members are evil,

<EM>&gt;&gt; destructive, stupid and selfish creatures (and I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; claiming myself as an exception).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I really don't buy the 'destructive, stupid, selfish' line;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destructive compared to what...?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think human beings are stupid, destructive and selfish because the their
<BR>
actions within History. Of course you can argue that now we are less
<BR>
destructive and stupid than 200 years ago; it's true but that does not
<BR>
invalidate the stupidity, selfishness and detructiveness within present
<BR>
human minds. To put in mathematical terms: the ratio stupid actions/smart
<BR>
actions is high enough for me to consider all humans stupid.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; However, I think that there has been a major evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; from an intellectual and cultural point of view in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; human masses of civilized countries in the past centuries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that presently continues and, hopefully, will continue.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think we've just got a whole bunch of new technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that make us *seem* more humane.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although technology has something to do with it, I believe a better
<BR>
education is the main basis for our evolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; It's the old American view of free-market and anarcho-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; capitalism -- bound to generate huge wealth but also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; enormous social problems and ecological disruption.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can't have a government without first having a market;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thus, if markets causes social problem those problems are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insurmountable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not going to discuss free-markets because I've done it before, everyone
<BR>
knows my opinions and I already know yours.

<P>As a general statement in the present time, I believe it's quite difficult

to combine intelligence and destructiveness.

<EM>&gt;Many of the problems Joao Pedro lists are not caused by the free market or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the non-existent anarchocapitalism (what part of this planet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchocapitalist in any sense of the word?:).  A lof of social problems in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the US are caused directly by government intervention in the market.  Rent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control, e.g., creates a housing shortages and exhorbitant rents for new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dwellings in NYC, near where I live.  (It also causes more people to move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the city to the countryside, creating commuting and environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems.  This is also aided and abetted by former government development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plans which sought and still seek to cram all humans into ideal suburban or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rural communities.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ecological disruption is, to a large extent, caused by government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protections and subsidization of unprofitable economic development.  Face
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it, the free market on its own would not invest in the Amazon, the American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Southwest, or Nigeria.  Those places are either unsafe, don't provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skilled labor, don't have the infrastructure (roads, housing, etc.), or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lacking in resources.  Also, what resources there are are already owned --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the Lockean sense of the world, even if the local governments don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognize such ownership -- by the locals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not saying the cure to all these problems is a free market, but a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;market is not the cause of them.  Nor would not having a free market help.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Argh!  I've violated my own maxim not to get into political debates on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sorry but I'm not going to do the same. But I obviously disagree with
<BR>
you.

<P>Hasta.
