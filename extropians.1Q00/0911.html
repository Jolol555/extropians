<EM>&gt;  Well EvMick, many farmers over the last 30 years or so have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  getting paid by the government not to plant as much as they could.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I think this was done primarily to keep the crop prices high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so as to allow the farmers at the margin (usually small farms)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to continue to operate.  I know the government trend was to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  decrease this market distorting subsidy in the long run but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm not sure whether or not this is still being done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Before I started trucking I had a ten acre plot of land that i raised my son 
<BR>
on....(he's grown now and lives there with his family)....it's surrounded by 
<BR>
farmland...
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact...the program you refer to is called CRP (crop reduction 
<BR>
plan?.....crap?...dunno)....and there is a LOT more animal habitat within a 
<BR>
mile of my place now than there was when I moved there.....hundreds if not 
<BR>
thousands of acres worth.  
<BR>
<P>The old &quot;farmer&quot; just sits back and collects his check periodically and 
<BR>
ocassionally goes hunting on his &quot;farmland'.....
<BR>
<P>Something like that is definitely what it'd take to get a farmer to take land 
<BR>
out of production....
<BR>
<P>Of course...there are the double dippers....some sneaky fellers have figured 
<BR>
a way to get paid NOT to farm one crop...and then manage to farm another crop 
<BR>
on the same land.....
<BR>
<P>Like cattle...
<BR>
<P>Or a pheasant lease....
<BR>
<P>.....thus....getting government money.....PLUS..
