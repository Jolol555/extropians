<EM>&gt; The one difference, however, with Native Americans, is that their nations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are still recognized.  The right thing to do in their case, would be to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as much land as is possible back to them and allow them to find their way in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the world.  We can't undo the last 500 years, but we can give all that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Federal land in the US back to them -- where it can be proven that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their land.  Then recreation (skiing, boating, etc.), mining, and logging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns would have to pay a more equitable price for its usage and be less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to damage it in the process.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is a rather simplistic view of the issue.
<BR>
<P>For one, the Native Americans were quite busy doing their own empire
<BR>
building as recently as the first half of the 19th century.  This was
<BR>
documented by American and European explorers in addition to tribal
<BR>
histories.  As far as I know, this has never been taken into consideration
<BR>
and is the reason that you find tribes that are clearly from the Great
<BR>
Plains living in the Pacific Northwest and other odd distributions of
<BR>
related tribes.  It is interesting to note that the Warrior-Merchant tribes
<BR>
were among the most economically successful, both before and after European
<BR>
domination and controlled relatively large sections of North America at
<BR>
various times.  The historical patterns of Native American politics and
<BR>
conquests closely mirror European history in many respects.
<BR>
<P>As for Native Americans being better stewards of the land, this concept is
<BR>
largely a cultural myth.  In fact, some of the most egregious acts of
<BR>
environmental destruction I have ever seen were perpetrated by Native
<BR>
Americans on their own land.  They are no better or worse than anyone else
<BR>
at environmental conservation.  In my experience, small private
<BR>
agricultural and forestry concerns run by ordinary Americans have among
<BR>
the best records for good environmental management (necessarily -- many
<BR>
of these people have been earning a living off the same lands for many
<BR>
generations, something that mandates excellent conservation practices).
<BR>
<P>Additionally, I am strongly against making &quot;reparations&quot; to the Native
<BR>
Americans in general.  A lot of people don't realize that the U.S.
<BR>
government has already paid enormous sums of &quot;reparation&quot; money to many
<BR>
of the tribes to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars per person. 
<BR>
I grew up on a couple different Reservations, and I have a lot of
<BR>
first-hand experience with the Native American communities.  Most of them
<BR>
*grossly* mismanage their assets and money.  The reparations to date have
<BR>
done nothing but turn most Native American tribes into welfare cases writ
<BR>
large, waiting for their next big check from the evil white government. 
<BR>
Their have been some movements within some of the Native American
<BR>
communities to get everyone off their collective asses and to become
<BR>
productive members of society, but most have failed.
<BR>
<P>And lastly, to pick a nit, the Native Americans/Indians are no more
<BR>
&quot;native&quot; than I am.  The current &quot;native&quot; Americans occupying the
<BR>
contintental U.S. are, to my understanding, invaders who pushed the
<BR>
previous occupants south.
