<P>
I don't agree with the philosophy behind the Clock of the Long Now, for
<BR>
several reasons.
<BR>
<P>The clock is a monument to stasis.  Its whole point is that it is supposed
<BR>
to be operating in approximately the same way 1000 years from now as it
<BR>
is today.  The only way this will happen is if people 1000 years from
<BR>
now decide to keep it around.  How can we pretend to know what people
<BR>
1000 years from now will do?  Do we think we have the right to bind them
<BR>
to following our will?
<BR>
<P>The future is about change.  Any philosophical endeavor which
<BR>
attempts to sugar coat or hide this fact is fundamentally mistaken
<BR>
(see Star Trek for an example).  Take a look at Robin Hanson's graph
<BR>
at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/grow/longgrownew.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/grow/longgrownew.html</A>.  Once the next growth
<BR>
mode hits (call it a singularity), in five years we will have as much
<BR>
progress as in the entire course of human history up to that point.
<BR>
And then things really take off.  Whether the Clock or any other structure
<BR>
survives that transition is not something we can predict or control.
<BR>
<P>The clock seems designed to make people feel ephemeral.  You go see it
<BR>
and you are supposed to think, wow, this will be here long after I am
<BR>
dead and gone.  But this is not a feeling we should celebrate.  It is
<BR>
a terrible tragedy that people today are trapped in such short lives.
<BR>
We should work on making ourselves last 10000 years, not a clock.
<BR>
That would be a truly worthy endeavor.
<BR>
<P>What we need is, prompted by Robin's file naming convention, a Clock of
<BR>
the Long Grow.  It should be an artifact that does give us a long term
<BR>
view, but that view is not one of a static structure which stays around
<BR>
for 10000 years.  It should show us that the one constant in life is
<BR>
change, and that we must expect changes tomorrow that exceed those we
<BR>
have had in the past.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps it could be a clock which is designed, as surely as modern
<BR>
technology permits, to destroy itself 20 or 30 or 50 years in the future.
<BR>
Only some super-advanced technology could prevent its destruction.
<BR>
<P>Maybe it could have an embedded nuclear bomb.  Or maybe it could be
<BR>
launched into space, to wander aimlessly until someone gets it into his
<BR>
head to expend the trivial expenditure to find and return it to earth.
<BR>
(Often people would ask, with the Pioneer space probes which were the
<BR>
first to leave the solar system, where will they end up eventually?  To me
<BR>
the answer has always been obvious, they will end up in human museums.)
<BR>
<P>The point would be to create an artifact which only made sense if the
<BR>
future was one of unimaginable power and wealth.  This would be a far
<BR>
more inspiring and hopeful effort than making a clock which is only
<BR>
going to fool people into picturing a future that is just like today.
<BR>
