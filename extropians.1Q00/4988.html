<EM>&gt; What is the difference between a &quot;simple&quot; nanobot attack and a complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanobot attack?  If a zillion nanobots invade my body and commence to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismantle me molecule by molecule, is that a simple nanobot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attack?
</EM><BR>
<P>A &quot;simple&quot; attack is a bunch of nanobots floating in the breeze, waiting to
<BR>
bumb into something they can disassemble.  A &quot;complex&quot; attack is a swarm of
<BR>
robotic insects equipped to defeat your home security system, which sneak
<BR>
into your house and inject you with the nanobots (or just shoot you, for
<BR>
that matter).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you invision some vaccine to boost my immune system from this sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismantling?
</EM><BR>
<P>In the very early stages, when the nanobots are primitive, your immune
<BR>
system may cope on its own.  A little later, special drugs might help.  But
<BR>
by the time &quot;complex&quot; attacks are practical, you need to have a completely
<BR>
artificial immune system to back up your natural one.  The artificial immune
<BR>
system would circulate sentry nanobots through your body, looking for
<BR>
intruders, and then direct swarms of combat nanobots to destroy invaders.
<BR>
<P>A good system would be able to store a significant reserve of pre-build
<BR>
nanobots, and would be able to co-ordinate their efforts and build
<BR>
replacements on demand (within the limits of your body's energy supply, of
<BR>
course).  That should make you pretty much immune to small doses of any
<BR>
invader that isn't dramatically more advanced than it is (although it won't
<BR>
help much if you fall in a vat of disassemblers).
