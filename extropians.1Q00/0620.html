<EM>&gt; I also have extensive education in both electronics and composition, as well 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as being an accomplished player. I first started playing around with Synths 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they used to have oscillators on their bellies... we'd make sawtooth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waves and go &quot;''woah&quot;...bzzz!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There is a lot to be said for the sawtooth wave.  The harmonics are so
<BR>
undeniably appealing and the waveform is very versatile.  I wish I
<BR>
had learned to program synths on an old analog beast.  My first
<BR>
experiences were in the early ages of digital.  Not very pretty from a
<BR>
programming standpoint :^)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Taking music and art into new realms (for me) require a commitment to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly the opposite, not losing &quot;interest&quot; in the fundamentals. This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly what I find boring with the many MANY house, dub, techno,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ambient,  and electronica CDs that I REALLY want to like... they've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abandoned all else  in a quest for &quot;waoh&quot;...bzzzz  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is a very true characterization.  Lately one of the biggest problems,
<BR>
as I see it, is that when you buy a synth it almost always comes with some
<BR>
arbitrarily large number of preset sounds which seem to be the staple of
<BR>
the &quot;me too&quot; crowd.  Worse, there is an increasingly large market for machines that
<BR>
effectively function as &quot;techno construction kits&quot; which take very
<BR>
little imagination to use.  A lot of the bland &quot;sameness&quot; with a lot of
<BR>
the mediocre techno is a result of these trends.  There was a time when
<BR>
creativity was born out of necessity.  Perhaps the barrier to entry has
<BR>
become too low.
<BR>
<P>One of the greatest blessings of modern synths is the depth of the sonic
<BR>
possibilities, but very few artists take the time to learn to program new
<BR>
sounds.  The amazing sounds these machines can make is what attracts me to
<BR>
them in the first place.  I cringe when I hear popular music where the
<BR>
sounds are so obvious that I can name the machine and patch number.  What
<BR>
is the point of using a synth if you aren't going to add something to the
<BR>
soundscape?
<BR>
<P>I am generally in complete agreement with you.  The sounds themselves can't
<BR>
carry a well-written piece, particularly if the sounds are canned.  The
<BR>
ability to build deep and interesting musical constructs from its basic
<BR>
components is still an essential skill for making great music; to
<BR>
integrate carefully designed sounds just adds to the experience. 
<BR>
Unfortunately, modern technology lets a person with mediocre skills &quot;pass&quot;
<BR>
for having talent, by letting the machine do all the work (basically
<BR>
utilizing the creativity of the person who programmed the machine at the
<BR>
factory).
