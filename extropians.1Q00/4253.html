Hello everyone, this is my first post to this group
<BR>
so if my thoughts are old (or dumb ;), please
<BR>
bear with me.
<BR>
<P>When discussing transhumanism in general and downloading
<BR>
in particular, one inevitably has to deal with
<BR>
the nature of consciousness and 'I-ness', as shown by the
<BR>
large number of posts about qualia and such.
<BR>
I have some thoughts on the subject.
<BR>
<P>If we assume that consciousness is 'just' a large quantity
<BR>
of complexly connected neurons, firing to and fro, then we
<BR>
can safely assert that it is (as is any formal system)
<BR>
independent of the media on which it is stored.
<BR>
This means that I can take a brain and replace every neuron
<BR>
by a small chip that behaves like a simple neuron (i.e it fires
<BR>
when it has recieved enough signals to exceed its treshold).
<BR>
Nothing novel yet.
<BR>
But what if I make every chip record its own state and after
<BR>
a while tell all my neurochips to play what they have
<BR>
recorded. The result would be a real consciousness that
<BR>
experiences something that has already happened.
<BR>
Since each chip has a record of its own states, we can
<BR>
actually cut the wires connecting them and still get
<BR>
the neurochips to play its recordings like nothing
<BR>
has happened, the consciousness would still be there.
<BR>
This is a really strange thought, we can now, for example,
<BR>
perform the same procedure with another consciousness
<BR>
and we would get two sets of neurochips that needn't
<BR>
be connected. In fact we could put them all in pile
<BR>
and the two individuals would still be there, feeling.
<BR>
But every linear combination of the two sets would also
<BR>
be an individual, since it's not possible to say which
<BR>
neurochip belongs to what.
<BR>
<P>Doesn't this thought-experiment in some sense imply that the
<BR>
model is flawed, that the core of consciousness
<BR>
(if one is a materialist, anyway) must in some
<BR>
way involve effects of EM-fields?
<BR>
What effect does this have on Moravec's downloading?
<BR>
