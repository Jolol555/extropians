<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Having read the same article, I have the same questions. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;are two basic kinds of GM foods, those that are created to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;enhance nutrition (micronutrient rice) and benefit consumers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;directly, and those designed to rake in profits for agribusiness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;by dumping huge quantities of pesticides into the environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(roundup soybeans)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Actually, that isn't quite right.  Roundup is a herbicide, not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pesticide.  The engineering is to add an enzyme that makes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plants roundup tolerant so you can kill the weeds using roundup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(a standard strategy with crops that are &quot;naturally&quot; roundup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tolerant).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Fundamentally this is being done to increase yield (allowing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;food crops to grow at the expense of the weeds).  If it didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit the farmers (and indirectly the consumers) through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;higher yields (= lower prices), then they wouldn't sell any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the seed now would they?
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert is correct, Roundup is an herbicide, a very effective one.
<BR>
It kill virtually all weeds, and all grasses as well.
<BR>
<P>My concern is about runoff, especially with the increased use of
<BR>
Roundup such crops allow.
<BR>
<P>This kind of agriculture is nonsustainable in the long run.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The last time I went shopping and looked at milk, the &quot;organic&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;milk was costing 1.5-2x the regular milk.  Those kind of price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differentials make a big difference to people around the poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;line.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Here is an exercise for those of you who want to put your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extropianism into practice -- go to the grocery store and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really *study* what the price differentials are for &quot;organic&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foods, then compute the difference in your food budget based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on going organic, then figure out what fraction of the population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is simply unable to afford that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I shop organic all the time, yes it is more expensive, and you may
<BR>
need to change your lifestyle to afford the best.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, makeup an argument that would justify having poor people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eat &quot;sub-standard&quot; food, if in fact that were really the case!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem with labeling is that it is creating the impression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that there are real qualitative differences between GM and non-GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;food, ignoring the huge amount of plant breeding that has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done for millennia that has effectively &quot;engineered&quot; most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the food supply we now have.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I never said GM food was substandard, or even bad. I'm sure you are
<BR>
well aware that talented gengineers (C) like yourself can insert
<BR>
genes into plants that no amount of crossbreeding could accomplish.
<BR>
<P>Crossbreeding involves co-evolution in an ecosystem, which adds
<BR>
considerable checks and balance to the new forms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The entire trend in agriculture is to produce more food at a lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cost.  Inherent in that process, the producers at the margin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are going to get squeezed.  Their approach to that problem is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempt to create a new &quot;organic&quot; market that they want to extend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into a &quot;natural&quot; (unengineered) market, so they can produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at higher costs and still compete.   Its like Pepsi asking the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government to put a warning on Coke-a-Cola products -- &quot;Warning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this product may cause indigestion&quot;.  Whether or not Coke
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does that, the net effect will be to drive Coke drinkers to Pepsi.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually that's only one trend, the agribusiness trend. There is a
<BR>
whole foods other trend, including heirloom gardening, urban
<BR>
gardening, market gardening, etc. New seed companies like &quot;Seeds of
<BR>
Change&quot; are not only saving lost varieties but producing new
<BR>
varieties that open pollinate. The goal is more nutrition per acre
<BR>
rather than simply more crop.
<BR>
<P><P>Your agribusiness companies have made it a crime for farmers to try
<BR>
and save seed.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its unextropian because its a marketing ploy, not a rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientific discussion.  I will freely admit that the anti-GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;food people do have some legitimate complaints (e.g. antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the food), but they are stretching the arguments to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;breaking point.  If you read between the lines, it is *no*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;GM-food, *no* pesticides, *no* herbicides, and while we are at it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lets get rid of the &quot;green&quot; revolution (since those crops don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work without high fertilizer levels), then don't even think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about going to your nice programming job today because you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;got to turn over a couple of hundred square meters of dirt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in your back yard so you can plant your crops so you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something to eat this winter.  Oh, and the millions of people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starve to death on our &quot;back to nature&quot; drive, well heck, they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just road-kill.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've already said, the paternalistic attitude of &quot;they aren't
<BR>
smart enough to understand&quot; is unextropian.
<BR>
<P>You are correct, some of those who are against GM crops have these
<BR>
attitudes.
<BR>
<P>I separate GM foods into those that are good for me, and those that
<BR>
are good for agribusiness.
<BR>
<P>I still want all foods labeled, so I can make the decision.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Most of the people on this list are sitting in nice suburbs or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cities in the U.S., Europe, Australia, etc. and don't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clue what agriculture is like at the margins.  I'm sitting in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Russia and almost every Russian I know *has* to grow food at their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dacha (country house) if they expect to survive above the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty level.  It is wonderful when those of us who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successful enough can grow our own food as a hobby or because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we don't like the taste of mass-produced agriproducts (Russian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dacha-grown tomatoes are much better than U.S. mass-produced!),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but it is quite different if you *have* to grow that food in order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to simply survive.  You show the people here a GM-food that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better nutrition (improving their health) or can tolerate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;application of a relatively inexpensive, moderately safe herbicide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(reducing their labor) and you will have them lined up in queues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to purchase your product (if it is available cheaply enough).
</EM><BR>
<P>I live in an apartment, and grow herbs and a few select vegetables
<BR>
on my window sills just to remind me of the real effort and costs
<BR>
involved.
<BR>
<P>Russia couldn't even make conventional agriculture work, so I have
<BR>
my doubts about any miracle GM cure. Anyway if people want to buy
<BR>
GM foods I say fine. I just want them labeled so I know what in
<BR>
there.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;It easy to understand why agribusiness opposes mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;labeling, their products will be unpopular with consumers any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;fail economically.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Precisely, but you don't explain *why* those products will fail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They will fail because of public &quot;perception&quot; manufactured by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the environmentalists that these foods are unsafe or harmful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since there isn't very much evidence for that, it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unextropian (irrational) to support practices that promote mass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delusions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your back to the &quot;people are to stupid to understand&quot; paternalism
<BR>
argument again.
<BR>
<P>I want to be able to separate GM foods created for enhanced
<BR>
nutrition from those designed merely to make the most money for
<BR>
agribusiness. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Are they safe? Corporations have limited liability remember.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Huh?  Tell that to Dow-Corning.  I haven't researched it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;completely, but my impression is that the scientific evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found silicone breast implants harmless and they still lost a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chunk of the company.  What happened to all of the asbestos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manufacturing companies? (Even though they didn't know they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;producing a harmful product until dozens of years later.)  And let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us not forget the tobacco manufacturers.  I will grant that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some cases it may be difficult to prove &quot;liability&quot;, but it does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem to me that the legal system is getting better in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regard.  Its going to be quite interesting to see if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;limited liability&quot; claims of closed-source software vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hold up in the long run.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe silicon breast implants are harmful, and god help
<BR>
anyone suing a tobacco company if I'm on the jury.
<BR>
<P>How about Bopohl (sp?) India, thalidomide?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Given the situation, why is this un-extropian?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing un-extropian that I can see, the paternalistic attitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;We know better than you&quot; is un-extropian.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;If that were the problem, I would agree, but I don't think it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is the sales job that has been done on John Q. Public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that if &quot;green&quot; is good, &quot;more green&quot; is better.  Unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things like the Delaney clause (regulating the exposure to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;substances that might cause cancer) and the &quot;public's impression&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is that of &quot;zero tolerance&quot;.  The problem is that to get toxins,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carcinogens, etc. to the level of &quot;zero&quot;, when our detection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capabilities are now up in the parts-per-billion level, means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that our food, water, etc. will get very expensive.  Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unscientific because you have 30+ genes in your liver designed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do nothing but get rid of toxins *normally* found in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diet (now-a-days they do more work metabolizing drugs).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So long as you do not exceed the detoxification capacity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those genes, you probably have minimal health effects.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I remember correctly Dr Bruce Ames said as much as 20% of the
<BR>
weight of a fruit or vegetable are plant derived toxins. Plants
<BR>
fight biological warfare.
<BR>
<P>I'm not for letting agribusiness off the hook on advertising by not
<BR>
labeling their products.
<BR>
<P>Like I've said I don't like the idea of Roundup soybeans, and like
<BR>
a good little capitalist, I want to know products that contain it
<BR>
so I can vote against them by not purchasing them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The two greatest &quot;controllable&quot; health risks experienced by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average individual are tobacco smoke and alcohol.  Everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else is orders of magnitude less significant.  If the greens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were really concerned about improving health they would start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with those substances.  Since they aren't, we should assume
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is some amount of &quot;religious faith&quot; involved in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approach and listen quite carefully when they lobby for changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in labeling under the disguise of &quot;free speech&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I have never been able to justify alcohol from an extropian
<BR>
standpoint and in fact quit 5 months to the day from using it.
<BR>
<P>There are many types of greens, including the latest, Bruce
<BR>
Sterling's Viridians.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;As I mentioned before, I am *not* against complete information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being available to the consumer.  It should be available more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;along the lines of &quot;drug&quot; information, where presumably you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a qualified professional (e.g. nurse, physician, etc.) who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explain to you the terms, risks, benefits, side effects, etc.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that situation the marketing tactics of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;environmentalist&quot;/&quot;green&quot;/&quot;natural&quot; camp would be clear for all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to see.
</EM><BR>
<P>I favor a very simple additional to the contents, like &quot;contains GM
<BR>
(37) soybeans.&quot; (37 being a made up number for Roundup) BHT,BHA,
<BR>
used muffler cores, clove cigarette butts, uranium mine tailings
<BR>
and Natural sea salt.....   ;)
<BR>
<P>The consumer could look up the appropriate info on their own.
<BR>
<P>I oppose leaving it up to experts or any other form of paternalism.
