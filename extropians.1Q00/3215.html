<P>While I did not exactly grow up rich, my folks were upper middle class and 
<BR>
always provided quite well for me and my brothers. We were taught the usual 
<BR>
things about hard work and perseverance if we wanted to survive in a hard 
<BR>
world. 
<BR>
<P>We were also taught that mere survival isn't enough. Once &quot;the money thing&quot; as 
<BR>
you put it is taken care of, the next stage kicks in. That stage is one of 
<BR>
meaning in life. What do I do with my life, that I will be proud to tell my 
<BR>
grandchildren about? What makes me happy? What do I love? How do I justify the 
<BR>
resources that I use up during my life? Do I give back more to the community of 
<BR>
man than I take? When I look back at my achievements at the end of the day, am 
<BR>
I happy with what I am doing? Do I look forward to the next day as a chance to 
<BR>
contribute? What jobs will let me answer positively to these questions?
<BR>
<P>After 35 years of hard work, I'm just now getting to the point that I can spend 
<BR>
more time thinking about meaning than about survival. Todays youth are lucky 
<BR>
that they get to deal with the important questions earlier, but they are 
<BR>
unfortunate in that it takes a mature and introspective mind to answer these 
<BR>
questions well, and there is little guidance available from the adults around  
<BR>
them that are still imurred in the 'survival' mind set.
