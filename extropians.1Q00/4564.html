<P><EM>&gt; While the destructive potential of nano is arguably greater than that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of nuclear war, given the slowdown in military procurement since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  end of the Cold War I _expect_ the nano industry to be dominated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  its early phases by civilian technology development. My hope is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the polycentric world order of today means that we're entering a period
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like that between 1870 and 1914 when, apart from the battleship race (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ICBMs of the day -- big, expensive, and of militarily dubious utility),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the armies of Europe made little technological progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems like a very insightful historical analogy to our own time, in many 
<BR>
ways.  Lately I've been thinking that the period between the Franco-Prussian 
<BR>
War and WWI might have some lessons for the current time, in many ways.  That 
<BR>
was also a long period of relative peace in the relations of the &quot;Great 
<BR>
Powers&quot;, and was also increasingly seen by contemporaries as a kind of Golden 
<BR>
(or &quot;Gilded&quot;) Age (see Twain's writings).  However, it seems that the 
<BR>
military and geopolitical predominance of the US is greater now than that 
<BR>
enjoyed by the UK in that period.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  (Barbed wire, machine guns, and war gas were _all_ available off-the-shelf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in 1871, during the Franco-Prussian war -- they became commoner over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  next 45 years, but generals in 1914 still believed in cavalry attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as fervently as they had in 1814, and real progress towards new engines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of destruction had to wait until an actual major conflict broke out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the then-extant tools proved inadequate.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Here I think things HAVE changed.  The historical truism that &quot;generals 
<BR>
always prepare to fight the last war&quot; may have finally passed the time of its 
<BR>
merit.  This may simply be a function of the naturally conservative military 
<BR>
command structure FINALLY coming to terms with the reality of steady 
<BR>
technological progress.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  If we are lucky, our military will be happy with their smart bombs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  F-22's, and stealth bombers until around 2030 or so -- and the nano
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  security problem will be a police/social one rather than one involving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  weapons of mass destruction. If we're _very_ lucky, the existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  political order will disintegrate under the weight of its own internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  inconsistencies before there are widespread military applications of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been saying for some time that the F-22 may well be the last significant 
<BR>
manned warplane, and will come to dominate the skies exactly 100 years after 
<BR>
little Spads and Fokkers sputtered and spat at each other over the trenches 
<BR>
of the first World War's battlefields.  Its successors are already beginning 
<BR>
to take shape on CAD systems:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.spacer.com/spacecast/news/milspace-00f.html">http://www.spacer.com/spacecast/news/milspace-00f.html</A>
<BR>
<P>That item presages the multi-role semi-autonomous robot warplane, conceptual 
<BR>
designs for which I've seen and which I've heard are being considered very 
<BR>
seriously in terms of their strategic and tactical significance.  These will 
<BR>
in turn be delivery systems for smart sub-munitions and sub-sub-munitions.
<BR>
<P>One of the main characteristics of these kinds of vehicles is their 
<BR>
significantly lower cost than current- and next-generation manned fighter 
<BR>
aircraft, since they 1) don't have to carry pilot-support systems and 2) can 
<BR>
be built with much lower service-life expectations in terms of numbers of 
<BR>
hours of total system operation.  They also have significantly enlarged 
<BR>
flight and tactical envelopes, since they don't have to be constrained by the 
<BR>
limit of g-forces a human can survive and can be risked in threat 
<BR>
environments much more dangerous than those to which a modern democracy will 
<BR>
expose the lives of their fliers.
<BR>
<P>The point of this digression is that the military think-tank establishment is 
<BR>
already developing a mind-set that could evolve into one adaptable to 
<BR>
&quot;nano-war&quot;: The factors described above in connection with anticipation of a 
<BR>
strategic and tactical environment characterized by a tiered deployment of 
<BR>
increasingly autonomous and smaller and smaller munitions seems capable of 
<BR>
evolving into the ultimate development of &quot;robo-warfare&quot; at the molecular 
<BR>
scale.
