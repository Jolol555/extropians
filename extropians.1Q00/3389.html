<EM>&gt; I am curious what your &quot;idea&quot; of an uploaded TH consciousness would

<EM>&gt; experience, i.e. sight? sound? interaction with the outside world?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interaction with others? Are the experiences within a Virtual World much

<EM>&gt; like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our own , only far more mutable?
</EM><BR>
<P>To QueenMuUSE, perhaps this will help. It's not exactly what I expect to feel
<BR>
more what I feel now but bear with me please it will surprise you. I meant to
<BR>
post this in response to the &quot;are you a mutant&quot; thread. However, I got only so
<BR>
far and saved the draft and waited. When you asked your question it made my post
<BR>
more poignant. Forgive me it is long.
<BR>
<P>(Please excuse the long introductory part. I feel it is necessary)
<BR>
<P>I am a cyborg. although by strict definition, as I understand it, we all are if
<BR>
we use...hmmm, depend on technology. I really depend on it. I can't ambulate so
<BR>
I need an electric wheelchair...a very high tech one at that. I have metal
<BR>
supporting one of my arm bones and another piece of metal (titanium) somewhere I
<BR>
won't mention. I have a computerized anesthesia pump in my abdomen that pumps a
<BR>
small metered dose through a tube that runs around to my back and 9 inches up my
<BR>
spine.
<BR>
<P>Without this pump constant pain and spasticity would push my blood pressure up
<BR>
to critical level endangering a stroke. So though I could live a while without
<BR>
it, in the long run I can't really. So I am a true cyborg. ;)p neener neener!
<BR>
Ok, it's not really an enhancement but at least I have a sense of humor about
<BR>
it. Oh I forgot to mention my spectacles and my pc.
<BR>
<P>Some might by now have guessed I have a spinal cord injury. It was severed at
<BR>
the cervical 5/6 level so I am a quadriplegic. So, I'm curious what people
<BR>
believe regarding some of the possible transformations those of our ilk are
<BR>
looking forward to? What might a disembodied brain experience sensory wise? I
<BR>
have a unique insight. 1) I come as close to being a disembodied mind as you get
<BR>
without removing a brain and keeping it alive in a vat somehow. 2) I have a
<BR>
reasonable understanding of technology and science. 3) I'm a little bit familiar
<BR>
with the ideas in Extropianism, such as uploading, virtual reality, bionics,
<BR>
etc.--enough I feel to relate intelligibly.
<BR>
<P>I got to thinking about this as I became more acquainted with the precepts of
<BR>
transhumanist technological expectations. I've had twenty years to become
<BR>
familiar with sensory loss. So I've encountered some unique situations that
<BR>
provide information most will not have. I think the best way to get to the heart
<BR>
of my premise is to use pleasure sensory to illustrate. I'll try to stay
<BR>
euphemistic so to not embarrass sensibilities.
<BR>
<P>I had occasion the other day to recall a discussion with my brother about
<BR>
virtual reality sensual pleasure. He thought it would be something I would
<BR>
really go for--I did not. Perhaps a little background is in order to understand
<BR>
why he felt this way. I cannot feel with my skin from just above my nipples
<BR>
down. Nothing, no pleasure, no pain. Well pain is a special case. I do have
<BR>
what's called dysreflexia which elevates my blood pressure dangerously when an
<BR>
area of the body below lesion level (not intervated with nerve sensory any
<BR>
longer) is having pain stimulus for whatever reason. This causes referred pain
<BR>
and headaches but the localized sensation is muted--totally.
<BR>
<P>My brother was looking through his paradigm and I only now understand this. He
<BR>
had no idea what it was like for me. He gets visually stimulated and he feels it
<BR>
in his loins like everyone else and I assume most if not all of you. This is not
<BR>
to say I do not get visually stimulated. Let me make a few distinctions here. 1)
<BR>
as far as the issue above of being visually stimulated, I am referring to while
<BR>
being awake (not making the distinction regarding consciousness or not some may
<BR>
be awake but whether truly conscious is debatable), 2) I am still capable of the
<BR>
physical outward indications of male arousal. 3) said state of arousal does not
<BR>
arise (no pun intended--maybe) from mental arousal--it is entirely to the best
<BR>
of my knowledge and experience and scientific experiment, purely reactionary to
<BR>
irratative stimulus.
<BR>
<P>Now let me get to the point before this turns into a thesis. I do NOT feel
<BR>
sensual engagements even in my dreams. I do not have the proverbial (sorry I am
<BR>
lost for euphemisms) &quot;wet dreams&quot; anymore. I have had evidence that they have
<BR>
occurred but I did not feel nor enjoy them as I did before my spine was severed.
<BR>
Now this concerns what is most often an involuntary occurrence, so what of
<BR>
voluntary? I can lucid dream so I of course have tried to direct my dreams so
<BR>
that I had sensual relations and even then I do not enjoy nor feel them the same
<BR>
way as before injury. It's as if being separated from it's external sensory
<BR>
information gathering equipment the mind is incapable of normal operation.
<BR>
<P>If sensual relations are as most believe largely the purview of the mind alone,
<BR>
why then can't I at least enjoy a rich dream life? I know we must consider that
<BR>
there is a psychological reason. I won't discount this. However, would this, if
<BR>
true, really affect the involuntary nocturnal emissary involvement? I have my
<BR>
doubts. As I have my doubts about uploading and jacking and VR. I don't think
<BR>
that an uploaded mind alone can perceive sensory information as richly as when
<BR>
it was wet ware. I have an open mind though and wouldn't presume to know enough
<BR>
about the dreamed of methods and technologies of uploading to rule it out. I
<BR>
only wish to help with a unique perspective. It's not my wish to rain on
<BR>
anyone's parade so please don't be angry with me. Lastly please forgive the
<BR>
haste in which this is written. I am having surgery on friday and one never
<BR>
knows, so I wanted to share this and time was short.
