<P><EM>     &gt; The problem is not that evolution is a fact.  The problem is calling it a
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt; fact with such finality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's rather refreshing to call a spade a spade from time to time and
<BR>
I commend the late great Carl Sagan for doing so. I love critical thinking but if
<BR>
every statement has a caveat and every caveat has an exception and every
<BR>
exception has a footnote then communication if not thought is paralyzed.
<BR>
<P>Monty Python had a skit about that, John Cleese is a highwayman pointing
<BR>
a gun at a defenseless traveler. Give me all your money or I'll shoot you right
<BR>
between the eyes. I don't mean I'll hit a point bisecting a line connecting the
<BR>
center of your two pupils I mean I'll hit you somewhere in the general  area
<BR>
of your forehead because I never miss, that is I seldom miss. See that tree over
<BR>
there, no not that one the other one, I reckon I could hit it 6 out of 7, ah, 4 out of 5
<BR>
times. Yes, on a good day, on a good day I could do that. Probably.  It's because
<BR>
I practice every day, almost every day, except when I'm feeling a bit tired, or the
<BR>
wife is nagging me to fix the plumbing or [...]
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;In  science calling an explanation, a fact circumvents Popper's  solution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah Popper, an amusing fellow but not to be taken seriously.
<BR>
Philosophers of science are not shy in telling others exactly how to find
<BR>
knowledge about nature but have never demonstrated any ability to actually
<BR>
do so themselves. They're sort of like professional movie critics.
<BR>
<P>And I'm not just talking about biology, Stephen Hawking writes about them in
<BR>
&quot;Black Holes and Baby Universes&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;philosophers have mostly not had enough mathematical background to keep
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up with modern developments in theoretical physics. There is a subspecies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;called philosophers of science who ought to be better equipped. But many of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;them are failed physicist who found it too hard to invent new theories and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;so took to writing the philosophy of physics instead. They are still
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arguing about the scientific theories of the early years of this century,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;like relativity and quantum mechanics. They are not in touch with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;present frontier of physics.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;Darwinism has changed many times, it is not one  single idea or &quot;fact.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs?
<BR>
As I said before things change, the fossil record shows us that Life
<BR>
evolves and nothing in science has more evidence in its support.
