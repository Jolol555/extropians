<EM>&gt;Subject: Christ, evangelicals and divine punishments...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;....I was fascinated by the thread about Jesus Christ.  I had already read 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;various views on his historical origins but still found the discussion to
</EM><BR>
be 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;food for thought.  I believe Christ to have lived and also to have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;divine but can see how people could contend over his origins.  I must do my
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;own research to see how accurate the posts were of certain people as to the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;evidence or lack of regarding him.  I find it very hard to believe that a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person could take the view that Christ never even existed.  From a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legalistic view at least it would seem very definite that he did.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Personally, I find it very easy to believe that christ never existed.
<BR>
Here's a great piece that is well written and exhaustively documented about
<BR>
the historical origins of Christianity itself and the historicity (or lack
<BR>
thereof) of jesus.
