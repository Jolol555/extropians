<P><EM>&gt; Are you referring to the creep who shot at some Jewish children, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  killed a postman?  If so, this is the first I've heard that he didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  act alone.  I do seem to recall it was said that he intended his acts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be the signal for a pogrom -- but if that makes him &quot;a militia&quot; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  might as well say the Black Panthers killed Sharon Tate.
</EM><BR>
Fact is that Bufford is a member of Phineas Priests which have solid Militia 
<BR>
ties.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the &quot;militias' don't seem to discriminate regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; klan allegience, why need I?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To avoid the appearance of know-nothing bigotry.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Klan and militias mix in well because they are the same identical people 
<BR>
who hold the same identical philosophies.  Why should I fear Johnny laws 
<BR>
goons more then some self-appointed hayseed death-squad?  As far as being a 
<BR>
know-nothing bigot? So be it!   By the by, MacVeigh trained with the Michigan 
<BR>
Militia which was filled with Klaners-fancy that? ;-)
