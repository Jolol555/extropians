<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Its funny that people like you are the ones who say that Mutual Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Destruction is insane, when its the same exact principle. MAD assumes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;neither party can be trusted, and only the external threat of instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;annihilation is what keeps both parties in check. The MAD strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;relied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;completely on the idea that both sides had to keep as total a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surveillance on the others activities as possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And your point?  Mutually assured destruction in a vacuum *is* insane.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when your avowed enemy has amassed enough weaponry to utterly wipe you out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the only way to keep him from doing that is to assure him that you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got the weaponry to do the same to him, then MAD is the only viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternative.  If he wipes you out then you wipe him out and there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winner, only two losers.  Obviously the best outcome is a win-win situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   But if my enemy is going to cause me to lose, I'd prefer a lose-lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation to a win-lose situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;relies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;savages and have no honor or rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well as I'm sure you realize, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition.  Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; men *are* &quot;nothing but savages.&quot;  Others behave themselves in ways more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worthy of the title &quot;Citizen.&quot;  If there were no such thing as criminally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minded people, there would be no need to have this discussion.  The plain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact though, is that that is not the case.
</EM><BR>
<P>But treating everyone by the standard of the lowest common denominator (the
<BR>
savage) communicates that there is no value, no benefit to behaving as a
<BR>
citizen. If you expect everyone to act the worste possible way, a lot of people
<BR>
will fulfill your expectations. And it will be YOUR fault.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But you miss the point, transparency is not about treating people as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; prisoners.  It's about treating people as family (which when you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is what they are).  I know almost everything about my wife.  Her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; finances, her hopes, her fears, her weaknesses, her strengths.  I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly how she'll react if I kiss the backs of her knees.  I know where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is almost all the time.  Does that make her my prisoner?  Especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) she knows that I know these things about her and (2) she knows all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; same things about me?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You have that relationship and you know those things about each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;because you both trust each other, not the other way around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think so.  You can't trust someone you don't know anything about.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't trust you.  That doesn't mean you are a bad person.  All it means is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I don't know enough about you to determine whether or not you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trustworthy.  Sure all people are innocent until proven guilty, I just don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make it a policy to give unknown people the opportunity to prove their guilt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on me.
</EM><BR>
<P>However you don't need to know everything about everyone. As work by Robin
<BR>
Hanson and others with Baysean theory shows, you don't need to know everything.
<BR>
The only people who insist on knowing everything about everyone are those that
<BR>
have the lowest possible opinion of their fellow man. Such people should be
<BR>
considered to sick to be allowed to contribute to the development or
<BR>
implementation of public policy.
<BR>
<P>You give untold numbers of people the ability and opportunity to prove their
<BR>
innocence every day, and they do so in many ways, all the time. That you prefer
<BR>
to focus on the rare incident and/or minor risk of guilty behavior, while
<BR>
ignoring the overwhelming weight of innocent behavior as evidence to attest to
<BR>
the 'reasonableness' of your proposals indicates that you have some issues.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;However, a true spousal relationship is based on the mutual trust that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;respect for the other, and the desire for respect from the other, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could spend ten years apart from your spouse and they would trust that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would behave with respect toward them the entire time, even though they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have no idea what you are actually doing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not necessarily.  If my wife just disappeared for 10 years without telling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me why and where she was going and when she'd be back, she would have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come up with a *damn* good explanation when she got back in order to regain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my trust.  And to the extent that I would trust her while she was gone, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trust would be based on the things I was able to learn about her before she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left.  In other words, my surveillance of her.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't say that she would dissapear without telling you why, but even then you
<BR>
allowed that if she had a damn good reason, then it would be ok. If she told you
<BR>
she was going to Jupiter on a NASA mission, with 20 men, for ten years, what
<BR>
would you do then?
<BR>
<P>Moreover, once you developed a level of trust in her, from her past record, you
<BR>
acknowledge that it would be ok for her to NOT be under your surveillance for
<BR>
ten years, so you have just given up your insistence of total surveillance. You
<BR>
don't spy on your wife at work, do you? Do you feel you have to? Why? Do you
<BR>
have a mental problem?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The thing is, I trust myself more than I trust you, this is a given.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However I do trust you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to an extent based on your record and based on the fact that you come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from a respectable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;background.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, you trust me to the extent that you've been able to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;surveillance&quot; on me.  Without the information gained regarding my record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and my respectable background, you'd have no basis for trusting me, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you.  You have made my point better than I could have.
</EM><BR>
<P>No I haven't, because I do not base my judgement on 30 years of utter and total
<BR>
surveillance of your every waking movement, action, and utterance. However,
<BR>
given your history on this list of tending to prefer solutions proposed and
<BR>
espoused by paranoid , megalomaniacal fascists, my level of trust in you is low
<BR>
and would need to be augmented by countering evidence that you are only playing
<BR>
devils advocate, etc...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The sort of people who beleive that Mutual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Surveillance is the only option are the sort of people who beleive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fascist &quot;People are no damn good and need to be controlled&quot; routine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, not at all.  I believe in MAS, but I believe that people for the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part want to be, and are, good.  But only an idiot could believe that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no such thing as cheaters.  MAS offers no threat to honorable people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they have nothing to hide.  On the other hand, MAS encourages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dishonorable people to do the right thing.  In other words, we have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly sought after but rarely found &quot;win-win&quot; situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Treating all as if they are each the worst possible person is not the way to
<BR>
build trust.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sureveillance is the worst sort of tyranny, it does not matter one whit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its all mutual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sticks and stones...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Its the same thing with the socialist argument with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;property:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't trust anybody but myself to responsibly handly property, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nobody has a right to property.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apples and oranges.
</EM><BR>
<P>cortlands and granny smiths.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;back to the trust issue, we make a contract between us, where we both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;claim we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;honorable, trust-worthy, and have integrity. Only those that break that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  contract can be judged to have no honor or integrity, and therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have total surveillance. THis is the presumption of innocence. A total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surveillance society throws out the presumption of innocence, because by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;definition, the idea that all must be surveilled indicates that none
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can be trusted, that none have honor or integrity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, no.  MAS has nothing to do with the presumption of innocence.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presume everyone is innocent until proven otherwise.  MAS merely provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *verification* of innocence, or the lack thereof.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you need verification of innocence unless you don't trust anyone to be
<BR>
innocent? MAS has EVERYTHING to do with the presumption of innocence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The only difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;between a Mutual Surveillance Society, and a Big Brother Fascist Society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is that in the fascist society some (those in charge) are either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;presumed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by themselves or everyone to have honor and/or integrity, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;else has any, while the Mutual Surveillance Society declares that no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has integrity or honor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, again you miss the point.  MAS differs from an Orwellian fascist state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in one very important respect.
</EM><BR>
<P>An unimportant respect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the latter, only the government has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power of surveillance over citizens.  The government itself is immune from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance.  Therefore, all power follows the one-way flow of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information...to the government.  In my MAS society information flows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally both to the government *and* to the people.
</EM><BR>
<P>To the common, public, well of information. Haven't you understood the Tragedy
<BR>
of the Commons?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Therefore you know just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as much about the government as it knows about you, even more.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't care what the government does, so long as it stays out of my life. If it
<BR>
treats everyone like I want it to treat me, then there is no need for your
<BR>
Orwellian anarchy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fighting tooth and nail to get partial, misleading and redacted FOIA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.  You just get on the web and point your browser to, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clinton's bank records, or the full copies of all FBI, CIA, NSA, KGB, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IRS records.  You can also access the name, address, telephone number and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; location of anyone who accessed any of that information about you.  See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here's how it works:  Zero Powers looks up Michael Lorrey's bank records.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In order to do that I have to reveal my own identity so that, if he wants to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael Lorrey can (1) find out that I looked up his records, and (2) if he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants to, he can do the same to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you know my bank records, then you know my account information. If you know
<BR>
my biometrics and my PGP keys, then you can impersonate me and steal my assets.
<BR>
With total mutual surveillance comes the end of not only privacy, but property,
<BR>
free speech, free association, and self defense.
<BR>
<P>With MAS, because everyone will know everything you say, you won't dare say
<BR>
anything that the majority will dissaprove of.
<BR>
<P>With MAS, none of your property belongs to you anymore, because everyone knows
<BR>
where it is, and when you are not there to watch it, and what your security keys
<BR>
are, etc.
<BR>
<P>WIth MAS, everyone will know with whome you associate, so you will not associate
<BR>
with anyone that is not approved of by the majority.
<BR>
<P>With MAS, everyone will know where you are at any given time. A person with the
<BR>
wish to kill does not care about the consequences of that action, if they know
<BR>
where to find you while they are still enraged, they will find you and kill you.
<BR>
If the majority decides that you are a politically dangerous individual, you
<BR>
will be found, and dissention will end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So now what?  I can say &quot;Hey Michael I see you just paid another $200 to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ATF for another machine gun.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And you can say, &quot;Yes, I know that you know that.  And you also know that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know you just paid $200 for another bullet-proof vest, but that wouldn't do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you much good if I decided to use my armor-piercing bullets on you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And then I could say, &quot;Perhaps, but since I follow you around with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ubiquitous public surveillance camera network, I would know the minute you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left your house with your machine gun and I could follow you as you got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closer and closer to my house.  As soon as you got within 100 feet of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front door, I'd alert the AI police chief who would be ready to incapacitate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you with the nano-police the second you pointed your gun at me and put your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finger on the trigger.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And then you could say &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right.  So I won't kill you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today.  Hey wanna go check out a football game?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Which merely illustrates the depth to which your paranoia has developed. Since
<BR>
machine gun technology has been around since the 19th century, and it has been
<BR>
the least commonly used gun technology in crime, while there are over 200k
<BR>
private owners. This record indicates that, by definition, a person who owns a
<BR>
machine gun is not very likely to commit a crime with it, and is therefore
<BR>
trustworthy. All your surveillance of me does is feed your paranoias to the
<BR>
point that you and every other paranoiac start screaming to the government that
<BR>
everyone needs to be locked up in chains to make the world safe for paranoiacs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And then I could say &quot;Sure, but lets leave the machine guns at home this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, OK?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Trust is based upon respect, not intimate knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Without at least some knowlege, what could there possibly be to base respect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon?
</EM><BR>
<P>That is your primary problem. You don't, in your heart, assume that anyone is
<BR>
good or innocent. Your insistence that people prove their innocence indicates
<BR>
you don't beleive in the presumption of innocence. I do beleive in the innate
<BR>
goodness, innocence, and trustworthyness of the vast majority of people. I do
<BR>
not prejudge everyone based upon the poor behavior of less than 1% of the
<BR>
population, and I know that if anyone ever does prove me wrong in their
<BR>
particular instance, I am prepared to deal with that individual, in that
<BR>
instance, as they should be dealt with, while I can go on treating everyone else
<BR>
as normal, honest, honorable human beings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;No, I would resent that you knew many private and embarrasing things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that I would prefer that others did not know. You would know that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;was a point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of embarrassment and would use it with your primate hard wired instincts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pecking order to humilitate and denigrate me in order to make yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;look better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Um, not quite.  See first of all you would not resent *me* because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't be *my* fault that your private and embarrasing things are public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge.  You might resent society, but that should not cause you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direct that resentment toward me in particular.  More importantly, once you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found out that 95% of the people in your neighborhood had the exact same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private and embarrasing things contained in their public record, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private and embarrasing things would cease to be either private or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embarrasing.  And once we found out that my private and embarrasing things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were even more private and embarrasing than yours, there'd be very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentive for my &quot;primate hard wired instincts&quot; to make much of a fuss about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your private and embarrasing things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your problem is paranoia coupled with extreme extroversion, my problem is
<BR>
introversion. Since when does your problem become more important than mine?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Resentment leads to hate. You do not build trust on a foundation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah but you won't resent me.  See above.  Besides, I can be quite charming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I have to be ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I really hate slick people. I prefer people who are charming as a matter of
<BR>
course, not because they have to be...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;A society that would trade some freedom for security deserves neither
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;freedom nor security.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MAS does not trade off any freedom.  MAS will give you *more* freedom than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you ever had before.  Imagine being free to go wherever, and do whatever,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you want without having to first get permission (no visas, licenses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permits, nothing).  Imagine having instant access to *all* information all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time.  No searching through remote and dusty archives, no paying a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private investigator.  Imagine having whatever your heart desires (a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supercomputer, a near-anything device).  All that and more for the small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price of making yourself as transparent as the rest of society.  Maybe it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems like hell to you, but I can't wait.  (It is, after all, inevitable you
</EM><BR>
