<P>Stewart, IMO, merely identifying all of the species would be
<BR>
relatively worthless.  For the amount of money mentioned you
<BR>
would like to see demonstrable results.  So, perhaps, you may be
<BR>
mis-describing the project or else it may be mis-conceived.
<BR>
<P>Each species has a unique genome.  *Most* of that genome
<BR>
is pretty much similar to other species.  However there may
<BR>
be unique pieces of each genome that may code for a unique
<BR>
nanomachine or a unique regulatory path or a unique combination
<BR>
of genes that allow functioning in a specific ecological niche.
<BR>
It is the *difference(s)*, i.e. the unique *INFORMATION CONTENT*
<BR>
between one genome and another that is potentially of value.
<BR>
The only way to get that information is to have preserved samples.
<BR>
<P>I believe that it was pointed out in Science a year or two
<BR>
ago, that efforts to catalogue and preserve endangered
<BR>
species was wrong-headed.  Why?  Because the investment
<BR>
of time and money for each &quot;endangered&quot; species was so
<BR>
large and the extinction rate so rapid, that while you
<BR>
were saving one species you were aware of you would be
<BR>
losing hundreds you were unaware of.
<BR>
<P>The solution proposed was &quot;no-knowledge&quot; preservation.
<BR>
Go grab chunks of dirt, water, air, etc. from various
<BR>
shrinking environments and simply freeze them.  Don't
<BR>
worry about the census of what is in the samples, let
<BR>
the future generations of scientists figure that out.
<BR>
Since we are in the middle of a global extinction event
<BR>
(see &quot;Rare Earth&quot;) brought on by the ubiquity of humanity,
<BR>
if we have any moral sense, i.e. any consideration of the
<BR>
value of the investment nature has made in constructing
<BR>
various species, then we should be preserving environmental
<BR>
samplings as fast as possible.
<BR>
<P>The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and Celeara have shown
<BR>
the feasibility of reassembly of genomes from collections
<BR>
of partial information.  That implies that the normal
<BR>
&quot;protocols&quot; (which may be relatively expensive) that biologists
<BR>
would like to follow may be entirely unnecessary.
<BR>
<P>Catologing is *unimportant*.  What is important is getting
<BR>
samples on ice.   Given a genome, at some point in the not
<BR>
too distant future, one will be able to predict with relatively
<BR>
high accuracy, the environmental niche that genome occupied.
<BR>
The observational or inventory information of the species
<BR>
is of relatively low value compared with the data encoded
<BR>
in the genome itself.
<BR>
<P>You should be building a deep freeze, not a long clock.
