<P><EM>&gt; I prefer rational denial.  I have always believed, ever since a little 
</EM><BR>
tyke, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  that I would not have to die.  (Maybe this was a cause, or the result, of 
</EM><BR>
my 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  childhood atheism.)  Of course I had no idea how I was going to pull this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  off, since better men than me had tried and all had failed.  But 
</EM><BR>
nonetheless 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I never believed in, nor feared, my own death.  Then, lo and behold, St. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Drexler writes _Engines of Creation_ and suddenly the way out appears.  
</EM><BR>
All 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I have to do is wait for the nanoguys to do their stuff and I can have a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  complete body overhaul every 20 years or so.  I think I have a fair shot 
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  living until 2050 or so, and hopefully the tech will be in place by then.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And even if I miss the tech by a few decades, cryonic suspension finally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  seems like a viable alternative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Death?!?  We don't need no stinkin' death!

Well one form of denial is relgion, simply because its a way of dealing with 
<BR>
frustration with an intolerable situation.  One observation is that what 
<BR>
happens if a person is away from their cryo tank when the end comes?  What 
<BR>
about family and friends, are ya &quot;ok&quot; with the big goodbye to them, as long 
<BR>
as you survive?  It may not be a choice, however, I am desiring the BIG 
<BR>
solution as profferd by Moravec and Tipler. So far there has a paucity of any 
<BR>
other thinkers exploring this area with any usuable ideas. Maybe it does not 
<BR>
exist?
