<P>
<EM>&gt; Sarcasm mode on... &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeepers, I can't believe this group, how come you don't all have
<BR>
Physical Chemistry books on your desk?  I'm surprised you can even
<BR>
survive in this world...  After all its the basis for life itself...
<BR>
<P>... I wounder if I should move over to sci.chemistry, where the
<BR>
*real men* hang out...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sarcasm mode lowered somewhat... &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>And then what is it with these lazy asses, god it seems like they
<BR>
are multiplying.  Aren't they supposed to be sterile?  Even if not,
<BR>
shouldn't there be some selection affect against their long term
<BR>
survival?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sarcasm mode off... &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Reaction heats of fusion:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaction              DeltaHf (kJ/mole)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;H2 + F2 --&gt; 2HF           -271  (*2)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2H2 + O2 -&gt; 2H2O          -286  (*2)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C + O2 --&gt; CO2            -394
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4Fe + 3O2 --&gt; 2Fe2O3      -824  (*2)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3Fe + 2O2 --&gt; Fe3O4       -1184
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2Ca + 2C + 3O2 --&gt; CaCO3  -1207 (*2)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2Al + 3O2 --&gt; Al2O3       -1675
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12C + 11H2O --&gt; sucrose   -2222
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4P + 5O2 --&gt; P4O10        -2984
<BR>
<P>Obviously its difficult to make some of these reactions happen
<BR>
exactly as outlined, but I think they make clear a point.
<BR>
The most energy gets generated when you collapse the greatest
<BR>
number of molecules into most highly constrained compound.
<BR>
I.e. most of the energy isn't in the bonds but in the motion
<BR>
of individual molecules (i.e. the entropy).   Ideally what you
<BR>
want is something that would take two gases and generate
<BR>
a solid (since the energy in the molecular motion of the
<BR>
gases has to be released).  Lacking that, the Fe/Al reactions
<BR>
seem nice since one of the reactants is a gas and the result
<BR>
is a solid.
<BR>
<P>Of course if you want a rocket fuel, you might want something
<BR>
else unless you can construct an engine that expels the energy
<BR>
only as photons or accelerates sapphire pellets.  Wouldn't want
<BR>
to stand in the exhaust though... :-)
<BR>
<P>Now, getting back to the atomic hydrogen question, there is
<BR>
a ref on the net:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/TU/launch/Propellant.htm">http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/TU/launch/Propellant.htm</A>
<BR>
But unfortunately it doesn't provide much detail.
<BR>
<P>Going through my files I find:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Electric Propulsion: A Far Reaching Technology&quot;, Graeme Aston,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;JBIS 39:503-507 (1986)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1. Candidate Space Propulsion Energy Sources
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Type                      Energy Release (J/kg)
<BR>
&nbsp;Chemical (O2/H2)                1.5 x 10^7
<BR>
&nbsp;Free Radical (H+H-&gt;H2)          2.2 x 10^8     { == &quot;atomic fuel&quot; }
<BR>
&nbsp;Nuclear Fision                  8.2 x 10^13
<BR>
&nbsp;Nuclear Fusion                  3.9 x 10^14
<BR>
&nbsp;Matter-Antimatter Annihilation  6.3 x 10^16
<BR>
<P>So the Atmomic Hydrogen in He (current NASA work) does provide
<BR>
significant benefits but manufacuturing this propellant is likely
<BR>
to be quite expensive I would presume.  The value outlined in the
<BR>
table is presumably the theoretical limit and you have to discount
<BR>
it if you are &quot;freezing&quot; atomic H in He by the H/He ratio.  If you've
<BR>
got energy to burn (or atomic assembly), it might be a very nice fuel,
<BR>
particularly for things like &quot;deceleration&quot; in remote star systems.
