<P>
Mae Ettinger, the wife of the father of cryonics, Robert Ettinger, passed 
<BR>
away on the eighteenth.  She had lead a full-life and was in her eighties.  
<BR>
I have included the post from the Cryonet discussing it.  In time, Mr. 
<BR>
Ettinger will join her on the great adventure she has now embarked on.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
<BR>
<P><P>My wife, Mae A. Ettinger, died on March 18 after a heart attack and stroke.  
<BR>
She died at home under hospice care.  In attendance were her daughter 
<BR>
Bonnie, my son David, and myself, assisted by hospice personnel.
<BR>
<P>The delay between clinical death and initiation of our procedures was not 
<BR>
more than a minute or two.  Washout and perfusion were done by a local 
<BR>
mortuary that had had previous training and experience--two training 
<BR>
sessions plus one previous actual patient. She is now one of our patients at 
<BR>
our Michigan facility.  Further details will appear in THE IMMORTALIST and 
<BR>
on our web site.
<BR>
<P>She was a good woman, a good wife, and a good friend. I miss her terribly, 
<BR>
but retain hope for all our present and future patients.
<BR>
Thanks to the kind friends who have given their support and their 
<BR>
condolences.
<BR>
<P>Robert Ettinger
