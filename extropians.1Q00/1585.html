<EM>&gt; What is he referring to here regarding statistics?  Is it the case that

<EM>&gt; Or a substantial percentage?
</EM><BR>
<P>I asked him (Gregory Aharonian) what invalidity statistics he
<BR>
was referring to and whether he had any statistics on the
<BR>
outcomes of patent challenges.  His response (a copy of his
<BR>
newsletter dated 19981018, I'll forward to anyone interested)
<BR>
doesn't really address the questions.  His most significant points,
<BR>
as I understand them:
<BR>
<P>* Without a corresponding increase in resources the PTO has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increased the number of software patents issued per year by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 17x (~1300 in 1990, ~22500 in 1999, increasing every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;year) in the past 10 years.
<BR>
<P>* 80% of software patents cite &quot;insufficient&quot; non-patent prior
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;art (over 50% cite none).
<BR>
<P>There's more circumstantial evidence in his newsletter that
<BR>
lots of &quot;invalid&quot; patents are being issued, but none indicating
<BR>
that one could find and litigate these patents with a high
<BR>
probability of success.
<BR>
<P>He now has a list of some software patents that were declared
<BR>
invalid by the PTO or courts or withdrawn at 
<BR>
