<EM>&gt; It is the _information_ about how those molecules are arranged that is

<EM>&gt; unique and valuable; and it is that information that we wish to

<EM>&gt; preserve, not the mere physical substrates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precicely.  The &quot;crime&quot; (using the term in its most relaxed sense),
<BR>
in the lost of potential human beings (whether it is via a natural
<BR>
or an induced abortion) is the information about whether that
<BR>
collection of molecules &quot;would have worked&quot;.  If 50% or more of
<BR>
natural conceptions end in abortion (according to one issue of
<BR>
Science), then there would appear to be lots of faulty working sets.
<BR>
The cyronic preservation of the potential working set (of genes
<BR>
and imprinted information) seems unnecessary in an era when storing
<BR>
the information in a &quot;nondestructable&quot; form is possible.  [Remember
<BR>
we still have the C14 problem eventually destroying the viability
<BR>
of the frozen embryo, though it currently looks to be a minor
<BR>
problem for full cryonic suspension patients.  Presumably the
<BR>
fewer cells in the embryo make the loss of even one that much
<BR>
more significant.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; The only information value of a zygote is its genome.  A human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being that was born and lived contains far more information: all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their life experiences and ideas and successes and failures.  A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raw genome can't be anywhere near as valuable as that.  Our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intuition and legal system that sees zygote as something less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a full human being is a correct application of this fact.
</EM><BR>
<P>In fact, rationally there would be a fairly linear increase in
<BR>
stored information during childhood and early adulthood.  Implying
<BR>
that killing an adult is a greater crime than killing a child (more
<BR>
information is lost).  However, once you are an adult and you
<BR>
switch from rapid information accumulation to the exercise of
<BR>
crystalized information, your &quot;valuation&quot; probably ceases to
<BR>
change much.  I would agree that you accumulate memories on
<BR>
a linear basis, but question whether those memories have as
<BR>
much value, since so much of it is redundant information.
<BR>
So killing an old adult perhaps isn't much worse than killing
<BR>
a young adult.
<BR>
<P>So if our legal system were completely rational about it it would
<BR>
take into account the degree of information loss associated
<BR>
with a murder or wrongful death.  This may be used in the medical
<BR>
system in a different way, when there is a discussion of &quot;years
<BR>
of potential life lost&quot;, but I'm unsure the degree to which
<BR>
this gets carried over into the legal system.
<BR>
<P>The development of the technologies that could &quot;genotype&quot; the
<BR>
cells resulting from an abortion and &quot;assemble&quot; a human genome
<BR>
from that information will substantially diminish the loss
<BR>
that occured.  Furthermore, a fuller understanding of the
<BR>
genome would allow the assembly of a genome without the &quot;defects&quot;
<BR>
that were present in the original.  So, IMO, in the long run
<BR>
if you want a &quot;natural&quot; child, in the most rational way,
<BR>
you would have a &quot;natural&quot; conception, perform an abortion
<BR>
to get the information, then reconstitute a new embryo without
<BR>
any defects (leaving in place the many combinatorial variants
<BR>
that the &quot;natural&quot; process provided).  The question becomes
<BR>
the degree to which parents would still want to go to the
<BR>
genetic lottery.   Of course, given the expense and trauma
<BR>
of abortions, it probably makes much more sense to do this
<BR>
process &quot;in vitro&quot; with the egg and sperm as starting points
<BR>
for the genotyping.
