<P><P><EM>&gt; So what you are saying is that even if you still own the car, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade was considered even at the time of the trade by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participants,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you have to pay a tax on the increase value of the property, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you haven't sold the property?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It depends.  Apparently there is a 'loophole' which allows one to value
<BR>
inventory at cost, if that is lower than fair market.  So if the total
<BR>
fair market value of the inventory went up, but the total cost didn't,
<BR>
then there would be no taxable increase in inventory valuation, if you
<BR>
report it 'at cost'.  Part III of the long form Schedule C (it's not on
<BR>
Sched. C-EZ) is where you report inventory valuation for a sole
<BR>
proprietorship trading business.  So in my earlier example where you
<BR>
start with a $50 pig and end up with a $1000 car, with no cash changing
<BR>
hands along the way, you would apparently not have a $950 Sched. C income
<BR>
if you used the 'at cost' loophole.  It is an intriguing question whether
<BR>
if one were to barter one's way from owning a $50 pig to being a
<BR>
millionaire, that method would allow one to avoid paying any income tax. 
<BR>
I suspect the catch is that when you convert 'stock in trade' to personal
<BR>
use, it would have to be accounted for at fair market value.  
<BR>
<P><P><P>Whether the trades are considered 'even' by the participants is sort of a
<BR>
red herring.  That doesn't really have anything to do with the income
<BR>
tax.  The income tax does not recognize any 'profit' or 'loss' which is
<BR>
made at the instant that a transaction occurs based solely on the
<BR>
supposed relative values of the items traded at the time.  Instead, the
<BR>
income tax is based on the dollar difference between what you actually
<BR>
pay for something versus what you sell it for.  Of course at some point a
<BR>
dollar value must be assigned to the items you have at the end of each
<BR>
year for the purpose of that calculation, especially where the
<BR>
transactions are all barter.  That's why you report the fair market value
<BR>
(or the price you actually paid, whichever is lower) for your inventory
<BR>
each year.  
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;Thats bogus. Property taxes are 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxes and are not legal for the feds to impose.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If you regard the tax on the change in inventory valuation under Sched. C
<BR>
as a property tax, it is understandable that you might find it annoying. 
<BR>
However I don't see it as a property tax.  A property tax is levied at a
<BR>
set rate on the whole value of certain property, year after year.  It is
<BR>
like a rent.  The tax on inventory change under Sched. C is really an
<BR>
income tax, because it is levied only once on any positive change in
<BR>
inventory value for a particular year.  That positive change in inventory
<BR>
reflects income, or is a recognized form of income, which is why it is
<BR>
part of the income tax.  And as I mentioned above, you can report the
<BR>
actual cost of inventory if it is lower than the fair market value.  See
<BR>
the Sched. C instructions.
<BR>
<P><P>Perhaps you are thinking of the capital gains aspect of the income tax,
<BR>
where you don't have to pay any capital gains income tax on the increased
<BR>
value of appreciated property so long as you have not yet sold it, or
<BR>
traded it for non-'like kind' property.  I described the use of Sched. D
<BR>
(Capital Gains and Losses) in my last message.  A dealer or trader is not
<BR>
allowed to use Sched. D to report his dealer transactions.  He must use
<BR>
Sched. C, since he is running a business, not investing.  Sched. D is for
<BR>
investors who buy and sell capital assets.  The precise difference
<BR>
between a trader and an investor is not always clear.

<P><P><P>&nbsp;This is really 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; annoying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me. I'll have to do some research on this issue.
