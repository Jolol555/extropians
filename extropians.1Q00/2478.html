While I wouldn't disagree (given that &quot;twins&quot; are developing in a nutrient
<BR>
competitive situation), if you run across some scientific data I would
<BR>
like to see it.  It would take some careful thought and playing with
<BR>
the numbers to determine how much actual information there is in
<BR>
genome variations and in stochastic developmental processes.
<BR>
I do however think both are relatively low compared with the amount
<BR>
of data computers typically handle now-a-days though.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I think Caleb Finch's and Tom Kirkwood's recent book, &quot;Chance,
<BR>
Development, and Aging&quot; may have some related discussion (though
<BR>
the review I've seen on the book wasn't highly impressive).  Caleb
<BR>
has commented at several recent aging meetings on the impact
<BR>
of stochastic processes in the aging of individuals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And BTW, of course with mothers given fertility drugs and ending up with 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foetuses or some such, the prevailing practice *is* to cull some of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early, to permit the rest to survive. Nobody seems *too* horrified by this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Lifeboat rules, I guess.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I almost mentioned this.  It *is* an interesting situation.  Presumably
<BR>
if the RTLers were on their toes they would be objecting to these
<BR>
treatments on the grounds that you have to take lives to produce lives.
<BR>
On the other side, if you don't use the drugs, you don't get any life
<BR>
at all.  Oooh, Ooooh, that logical swamp has to hurt...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Hmmm, I don't remember seeing this discussion in LMG.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; p.99

Thanks.
