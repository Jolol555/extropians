<EM>&gt;Just how do you justify that moral claim?

<P>Haven't we gained from Rand and then moved beyond much of her dictation?

<P><EM>&gt;I say: No one exists to serve anyone. At the same time, everyone is free to

<P>Yes.  I think about this a lot because of an innate desire to be helpful
<BR>
however realizing this is *not* why I *exist* but is a product of my own
<BR>
character and sympathy toward other beings and other circumstances apart
<BR>
from my own.  While serving others can be very pleasurable and while I feel
<BR>
good about holding the door open for the person behind me, or help someone
<BR>
who appears to be overburdened -- it is still my *choice* and I am not
<BR>
doing it for brownie points or for credit or for feeling pity toward anyone
<BR>
or anything.  It seems that most or all, perhaps, to oblige or assist
<BR>
others is done with reciprocity -- a feel good is a valued exchange of time
<BR>
and attention.
<BR>
<P>I say: Enjoy serving yourself and if you like, serving others.
