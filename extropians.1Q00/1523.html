<EM>&gt;  &gt; It would be nice to take this work and apply it to antiaging and

<EM>&gt;  &gt; research.  A few years ago, I suggested coming up with a mathematical

model
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, that's the idea behind it.

<P>Great!  At least, I'm understanding you.:)

through use

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We first need a good water model. I haven't modelled freezing in large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volumes (it's on my todo list), but purportedly the freezing point is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally off-key.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please explain.  (If it will take too much space here, please email me
<BR>
directly.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Whether this is an artefact of small volumes, or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water model, and inasmuch this invalidates studied impact of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryoprotectants I do not know (but intend to find out).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is great to hear.  I wish I could help.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; nonlinear and very complex so that this method of search would be
</EM><BR>
better
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; than trial and error or an exhaustive search.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virtual screening is very new, and requires a lot of resources, both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in terms of hardware and manpower.
</EM><BR>
<P>But genetic algorithmns have been around since, at least, the early 1970s.
<BR>
If one could start with a simple model -- one that hardly works -- and just
<BR>
build on it, I bet this could be done a lot quicker.  We don't need
<BR>
perfection here.  After all, this would only act as an input into actual
<BR>
physical testing.  The searches coudl act to weed out more bad
<BR>
cryoprotectants...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Anyone interested in this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; And what is the current method of research on this?  I hear about
</EM><BR>
results,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cryobiology is but a tiny subfied of a subfield, counting about 200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practitioners world-wide, most of them past their prime. Molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modelling is hence slow to enter the field.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can understand, but that also means no one else is probably doing the work
<BR>
there, so you need not fear competitors for a while.  You'll be the pioneer.
<BR>
<P>Also, cryobiology is not the only field I mentioned.  Antiaging research is
<BR>
the other.  What of that?  If one can develop a good model of aging at the
<BR>
cellular or molecular level, then finding new ways to combat it would seem
<BR>
to me to be a lot easier.  From the looks of it, it appears most research in
<BR>
this area is identify a mechanism, find something that inhibits it, look for
<BR>
similar things to that inhibitor, and so forth.  Am I right?
<BR>
<P>A simulated aging cell could be used to more efficiently search for aging
<BR>
inhibitors and therapies, no?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; but I'm not sure about the program.  I assume it's basically trial and
</EM><BR>
error
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; because the results seem disjointed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks to Greg Fahy, we seem to understand colligative cryoprotectant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mixes more or less well now.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not as familiar with the field as you, but I'd like to be.
<BR>
Specifically, I'd like to know how people come up with ideas for new
<BR>
cryoprotectants.
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
