<P>
My own observations and introspective experiences have led me to the same
<BR>
hypothesis.
<BR>
Taking a lot of LSD as an undergraduate was also thus conducive ;)
<BR>
Incidentally, I have found deep parallels between this idea and some core
<BR>
elements of Ch'an, or Zen, ideology.  
<BR>
Anyway, this leads me to wonder, in the presence of great minds:
<BR>
<P>Assuming 'subjective continuity of identity' is an artifact of the 'process'
<BR>
of 'waking up' (presumably into each moment as one wakes to each day) in the
<BR>
presence of memory, what might the nature of this 'process' be?  What
<BR>
exactly is it, that is 'uploaded'? (lol here we go again...) 'Attention',
<BR>
perhaps? (whatever that is).  I myself am comfortable with the notion that
<BR>
my 'identity' is not more than a computational process (and a 'not
<BR>
necessarily unique' one at that), but I am still not comfortable with any
<BR>
attempts thus far to characterize it.
<BR>
<P>If this 'process' be a neurophysiological computation, then I would imagine
<BR>
that each iteration of this process would take a certain amount of time.
<BR>
One might suggest that since at any given moment there are different
<BR>
variables to compute (as circumstances inevitably differ), there could be
<BR>
variation in the duration of the 'process'.  Might the variability in the
<BR>
duration of the process of  'uploading'  'attention' (or whatever) be
<BR>
related to the human experience of 'faster' or 'slower' time?
<BR>
<P>Often, when 'I' sleep, it seems my 'identity process' is offline.
<BR>
Sometimes, however, while in REM phase sleep, it seems this process IS in
<BR>
fact, engaged.  'I' maintain a somewhat cohesive sense of self, which is
<BR>
subjected to a seemingly unlimited range of other (admittedly bizarre, at
<BR>
times) 'events'.  I presume members of this collective also share the
<BR>
experience of 'dreaming'. How does *that* work in the context of 'subjective
<BR>
continuity of identity?'   (Or any other context, for that matter...)

<EM>&gt; I have suggested before that all subjective continuity of identity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an artifact of memory. Just as an upload would experience &quot;waking up&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a new body, or as a Star-Trek transporter style deconstruction and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replication at a distance would produce a person with an experience of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; displacement, in each instant we invent the passage of time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; construct a subjectively continuous model of self. In each moment we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the upload waking up, relieved to still be alive. Taking the view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there really is a stronger or more &quot;real&quot; meaning to identity is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my view, the pitfall that leads to all this dualistic stuff about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the importance of going one neuron at a time and these head-of-a-pin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;who's the real me&quot; arguments.
