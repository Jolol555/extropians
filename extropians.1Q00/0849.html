<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't know if anyone has thought of this before, but how about getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Right to Life individuals to support abortion by cryopreserving aborted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fetuses?  Surely, cryopreserving them would be cheaper.  If we can get
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to fund this sort of thing, it would be a way to both spread cryonics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;defuse a very deep conflict in Western societies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Perhaps we could analyze this problem from two angles.  One would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technical feasability.  The other is whether Right to Life groups would
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;willing to support -- financially, politically, or morally -- this
</EM><BR>
option.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I doubt they would support it, it's too &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;un-natural&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad one of us is sure.  I'm not.  I'm going to ask the more rational
<BR>
pro-Lifers what they think.  I've already sent an email on this to Doris
<BR>
Gordon of Libertarians for Life.  (I think she's an atheist, so she's not
<BR>
basing her antiabortion stance on the Bible or some religious doctrine.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many of the women getting the abortions may be unwilling to participate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is their right to decide.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but this is beside the point.  Women who don't want to choose to
<BR>
cryopreserve would just do what they do now.  No difference.  But what about
<BR>
the woman who doesn't want to be pregnant, but feels qualms about aborting?
<BR>
This would give her another option.  It might also give the woman whose
<BR>
pregnancy can't, for medical reasons, be carried to term an alternative to
<BR>
current abortion which leads to the death of the fetus.  (For the record,
<BR>
I'm pro-Choice -- just to avoid any blanket statements about me.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Many pro-life people already offer to adopt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a mother's children if she bears them instead of getting an abortion, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these same pro-life people would presumably be the ones raising the
</EM><BR>
children
<BR>
<EM>&gt; once they were revived
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm aware, but this is tangential.  Surely, this is what a lot of pro-Lifers
<BR>
want, but giving them another option -- aside from no abortion or abortion
<BR>
with guaranteed death for the fetus -- might sway others over.  If it does
<BR>
this with enough people, it might be a means to fund more cryonics research.
<BR>
Also, a way to make cryonics more mainstream.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (and who wants that? They'd be psychologically safer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being raised by pedophiles).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree with the parenthetic comment.  That's just stereotyping
<BR>
people.  I know right to lifers who are decent parents.  Surely, they are
<BR>
not perfect, but they are not &quot;psychologically&quot; worse than &quot;pedophiles.&quot;  (I
<BR>
might also quibble with pedophile, since the term is used so broadly in
<BR>
America.  Someone who is 18 and has sex with a 17 year old is considered a
<BR>
pedophile and pigeonholed in the same category as the 39-year old man who
<BR>
rapes 10-year old boys and girls.  But that's another discussion.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Furthermore, I think some abortion procedures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are destructive to the fetus, so it's not feasible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Naturally, if someone wanted to fund a cryopreservation and the mother were
<BR>
willing to go along with it, they would not use a destructive procedure.
<BR>
Right?  Am I getting through here?:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But, scientifically, you've inspired in me an interesting point. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fertilized egg can be cryopreserved, implanted into a womb, and develops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a child with no problems. So, I propose that we start here and work
</EM><BR>
up.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Start with a mouse zygote, the procedure for cryopreservation is already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adequate, but could be perfected. Once it's perfected, allow the zygote to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a little further and see if we can still do it, work a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until we can develop something after 2 or 3 days development.. etc.. until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we can cryopreserve a fully mature mouse. The benefit of this approach is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you'd be bringing up problems one at a time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad to hear I've done something positive for Zeb.  I agree with Zeb's
<BR>
take on this as breaking the problem down.  (This has political problems
<BR>
inherent in it -- i.e., that embryonic research is being curtailed more and
<BR>
more.)
