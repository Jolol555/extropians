<EM>&gt; So here is the question, does the IRS have the legal right to tax me if I trade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my old bicycle for a tennis racket?  If the answer is no, then the system I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; envision will allow people to carry on the majority of economic activity tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free. Because in the end there is no difference between simple and complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade.  If the answer is yes, then my system still eludes the IRS because all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic activity is hidden by pseudoanonymous identities and encrypted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transactions conducted on offshore computer systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no national sales tax, so there is no tax on your sale. If you
<BR>
feel that the trade was an even trade, then there was no capital gain,
<BR>
so again, there is no tax to pay, either capital gains or income. 
<BR>
<P>Lets look at the worst case scenario: Now, if the IRS were as demonous
<BR>
enough to say that you can only deduct 80% of the value of the item you
<BR>
accepted as a business cost, but the item to traded to the other person
<BR>
was valued at 100% of retail value, then the 20% difference would be
<BR>
considered a capital gain. The other person would also have to pay on a
<BR>
20% capital gain, as to them your item you gave them would be valued at
<BR>
80% and their item the gave to you would be valued at 100%. So even if
<BR>
neither of you makes any money, the IRS may still claim you made a
<BR>
profit. I don't understand how the IRS could get away with making such a
<BR>
claim though. If such a situation exists I know of several good tax
<BR>
lawyers who are tax patriots (and who HAVE won cases against the IRS)
<BR>
who would love to decimate that sort of IRS scam. 
<BR>
<P>Billy: If you think that nobody gets away with not paying taxes, my
<BR>
freind Thomas Monteleone can tell you about it. He's a suspense writer
<BR>
(_Blood of the Lamb_, and others) who hasn't paid income taxes in over
<BR>
20 years.
