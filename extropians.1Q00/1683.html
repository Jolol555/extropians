A mention of this in _Slate_ caught my eye.  
<BR>
<P>A Dr. William Dobelle has apparently been implanting patients with
<BR>
electrodes to stimulate their visual cortex for the last 20 years.  In just
<BR>
the last year Moore's law has brought the electronic (and external)
<BR>
components of his system up to feasible performance and down to a feasible
<BR>
size.  
<BR>
<P>The system uses a meager 64 electrodes implanted inside the brain.  In the
<BR>
volunteer discussed in the published paper, visual acuity of 20/1200 was
<BR>
reached with a small portable camera able to fit over one eye.  The paper
<BR>
indicates that the camera itself is a bottleneck in visual acuity, due to
<BR>
the optical limitations of such a small size.  Digital zoom in a recent
<BR>
upgrade to the system has brought visual acuity up to 20/400, though this is
<BR>
at the cost of temporary tunnel vision.  
<BR>
<P>In addition to the camera, the system can take direct input from a
<BR>
television or computer video output.  Giving the patient net access via this
<BR>
mechanism is explicitly discussed.
<BR>
<P>Dobelle has plans for a newer version of the system, later this year, that
<BR>
will have 256 electrodes per hemisphere, for a total of 512.  The paper also
<BR>
talks about the possibility of upping this number by implanting electrodes
<BR>
which stimulate the visual association cortex.  (The current target is the
<BR>
primary visual cortex, though it appears some leakage is occurring.)
<BR>
<P>The amazing thing to me, beyond the incredible potential for this, is that
<BR>
the implant in the volunteer discussed in the paper has been in place for 20
<BR>
years.  Only the external components of the system have been upgraded in
<BR>
that time.    Also, Dobelle claims to have implanted neurostimulators in
<BR>
more than 15,000 patients worldwide.  I had no idea this was going on.
<BR>
