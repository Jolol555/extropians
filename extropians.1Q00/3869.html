Now, if you only get partial functional reanimation these &quot;hints&quot; could 
<BR>
prove very useful for recovering or restablishing those connections that

produce a satisfactory reflection of ones former self.

<P>I really enjoyed your post on dealing with the real possibility of us being 
<BR>
reanimated with less then ideal memory recovery and how we could 
<BR>
realistically try to deal with it.
<BR>
<P>I think the simple idea of keeping a journal is excellent!  I was raised in 
<BR>
a religious faith that encourages it's members to journal regularly but I 
<BR>
was never consistant.  You have given me additional reason now to actually 
<BR>
do it.
<BR>
<P>It would be so strange to have journals and video recordings of your old 
<BR>
self but feel no real connection to it.  Of course, there are people right 
<BR>
now who due to neurological shortcomings, must endure just such a situation.
<BR>
