<EM>&gt; &gt; I know I shouldn't do this...but I can't resist...

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Over the last several years I've been wondering about a new type of &lt;gasp&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun....Powered by gasoline...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Using wire as ammunition...

<EM>&gt; EvMick, I would offlist you if your aol.com address worked for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, which it usually doesnt.  The army has been experimenting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with liquid propelled projectiles since at least the early 80s.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had some tests going on at China Lake when I was there, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dont have a URL or the results.  I heard it worked a little like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuel injection in a car, where they forced liquid oxygen and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitromethane into the breech.  Dont know where the research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is today.  I heard they had an alcohol/LOX version too.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that Remington has as its entry into the 'smart' 
<BR>
gun market a rifle that has an electronic ignition system, I 
<BR>
expect that this will be adapted to use nitromethane bottles 
<BR>
the size of those CO2 cartridges used in paintball... The 
<BR>
electronic ignition will be tied into a user authentication 
<BR>
system. Of the first ten thousand on the market, you will 
<BR>
see large numbers of people getting killed by criminals 
<BR>
because they were not the owner of record in the household, 
<BR>
so they couldn't use the gun, and didn't have time to go 
<BR>
put on their secret decoder ring while the bad guys were 
<BR>
busy raping their victims and blowing their brains out. 
<BR>
Once these stories hit the press, the 'smart' gun will 
<BR>
go the way of the Yugo, the Pinto, and the Electric 
<BR>
Car...Of course the gun controllers will insist its 
<BR>
because we still allow people to own guns, and they 
<BR>
will go for an outright ban of all guns.
