</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For a group to cause trouble, you need to make a case for *what* would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motivate them to cause trouble.  Increased wealth and mobility should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;give people the ability to simply avoid or transcend the things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have motivated trouble makers in the past (oppression, taxation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prejudice, etc.).  Only if we get some loony-tunes religious or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchist terror groups that think their way is the only way will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have something to worry about.  Its not the average wo/man you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to worry about, its the people who would want to control *all*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of us that are a concern.
</EM><BR>
<P>The religious get my vote for &quot;most likely to ruin the party.&quot;  Everybody 
<BR>
else can be reasoned with or, as you suggest, have their demands met at 
<BR>
little or no cost to a nano-capable world.  But Muslim and Christian 
<BR>
fundamentalists will not be satisfied until they have imposed their 
<BR>
worldview on everyone else.  I'm less worried about the Christians because, 
<BR>
except in the case of abortion clinics, they rarely seem interested anymore 
<BR>
in resorting to violence to reach their ends.  The Muslims on the other 
<BR>
hand...can you say Osama Bin Laden with a near-anything device?  Yikes, and 
<BR>
double yikes!
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;
