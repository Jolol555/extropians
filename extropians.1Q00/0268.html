<EM>&gt; There are a number of reasons that mandatory labeling has problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (a) It may be difficult or expensive to confirm that the foods are
</EM><BR>
<P>Irrelevant. Products are traced from source, with the onus for labelling
<BR>
consistency at each stage in the chain. Any batch manufacturing process
<BR>
has to be able to do this, for proof of liability in event of a dispute.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  (b) We have been brainwashed by the greens to think &quot;natural&quot; is good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &quot;unnatural&quot; is bad. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but this is still irrelevent to the argument about mandatory 
<BR>
labelling.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  (c) We have a policy of labeling things for their known possible &quot;positive&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      benefits (nutritional labeling) or known &quot;possible harms&quot; (fat labeling).
</EM><BR>
<P>We also have policies on other labelling; advertising regulations,
<BR>
trademark abuse, that sort of thing.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I want to see mandatory labelling of GM ingredients in foods --
<BR>
so that I can seek them out. (In general they'll be cheaper, due to consumer
<BR>
stigmatization, and healthier, due to corporate attempts to address their
<BR>
bad reputation.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is a secondary safety argument involving the possible presence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of antibiotics in GM foods, but these are at very low levels compared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the probable consumption of antibiotics by the average individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given their presence in milk or annual prescription levels.  
</EM><BR>
<P>... Which actually makes them much _more_ dangerous, because they're
<BR>
more likely to produce antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when present
<BR>
in low concentrations (as opposed to simply killing everything that comes 
<BR>
into contact with them).
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, better, non-antibiotic gene tracer techniques now exist,
<BR>
and I expect these to be deployed rapidly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yep.  You have to &quot;trust&quot; that the process of developing and getting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foods approved and to market makes them &quot;safe&quot;, just as you do now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Presumably anyone who develops something toxic and makes it through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the approval process without it getting caught is going to be on the hook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a liability standpoint.  Manufacturers have a big incentive to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very conservative when it comes to things like our food supply.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The trouble here is that companies are limited liability operations, and
<BR>
furthermore their interests (maximize profit) differ from mine as a
<BR>
consumer (stay healthy and wealthy). This means that some form of 
<BR>
regulation to handle this implicit conflict is inevitable. The issue
<BR>
at stake is how to minimize the conflict of interest and minimize the
<BR>
amount of regulation required.
<BR>
<P>Not mandating labelling for GM crops is basically going to spread FUD in
<BR>
the food chain. I live in the UK, where we've weathered the BSE scare;
<BR>
I don't believe you (being american) have any idea just how corrosive
<BR>
a loss of public confidence in the food industry can be. Honesty in
<BR>
trade is a first step towards rebuilding trust between producers and
<BR>
consumers. It may not be profitable in the short term, but in the long
<BR>
term the food industry can't survive and prosper without it.
