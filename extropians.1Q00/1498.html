<P><EM> &gt; &gt;&gt;it's obvious to me that I'm saying I have no way to gather
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; enough data to read beyond it.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I had originally pre replied to this but took it out because I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; felt it complicated the matter too much for this particular
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; exercise.  So here it is again for the first time.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Even if one feels there is no more data and they're stuck
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; using what they've got, and is not enough for a conclusion,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they should still &quot;make-up&quot; imaginary data with properties
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consistent with that of the original data. bla bla bla, I
</EM><BR>
<P>They SHOULD!? Oh, my. Belief presented as fact. *BZZT*.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; think you can see where I'm going with this. So in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; conclusion because you still don't try to think further than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the data you don't think for yourself on issues like this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your conclusion is based on self-consistent but invalid premises, which
<BR>
the margin of this note is unfortunately too small to contain. And as for
<BR>
not thinking for oneself, Mr. Kettle at your service.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; But then again not making a decision is still a decision, so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in a way this is thinking for yourself. Hmm. Didn't think of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this before.
</EM><BR>
<P>Congratulations! In fact, the decision I've made is to live a life where I
<BR>
don't have to decide about this (G/g)od(s) business, and it works fine for
<BR>
me. Believe it or not.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;&gt;The sheaf of hypotheses lumped and labeled &quot;(G/g)od(s)&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; too broad for me to meaningfully disprove. Popper and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; all, you know.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It should be easy. The broadest definition I can think of is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;the creator of all things.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>*BZZT*! You weren't paying attention. I said &quot;the sheaf&quot;, and you pick and
<BR>
choose the easiest stalk to bend?
<BR>
<P>Sorry, cheap thinking on your part, and I won't waste my time discussing
<BR>
it further with you. You've proven you're in too much of a hurry to win
<BR>
the argument to actually think about it. I didn't think much of it when
<BR>
St. Augustine did it, either.
<BR>
<P>I do feel obliged to explain my decision, however:
<BR>
<P>&quot;God the creator of all things&quot; is your interpretation of the superset of
<BR>
all possible (G/g)od(s), I take it--you're using a very narrow
<BR>
definition; it is independent of (for example) &quot;God who exists in all
<BR>
things&quot;.
<BR>
<P>If you play fair, working from what I said instead of what you hear
<BR>
echoing in your own head, you're allowed to use a narrow definition to
<BR>
describe what you don't believe in, or what you claim can't exist, but you
<BR>
can't honestly palm it off as the set of all (G/g)od(s). So sorry.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; make up god because god is the &quot;creator of all things.&quot; So,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in a poof of logic god disappears.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you're glad you don't like spinach, because if you did, you'd have to
<BR>
*EAT* it, and You Hate Spinach.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Dear sir, you may be right.&quot;
