<P><EM> &gt; Well, if you are talking about incinerating the brain, or dissolving it in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; acid, or something equally drastic, I agree.  But the kinds of injuries that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; actually occur with any significant frequently aren't nearly that severe.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You surely speak from a rich basis of experience, here.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; For example, a few hours of ischemic injury would leave a quiet recognizable
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; brain.  You've got lots of molecules that have been degraded in some way
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (denatured proteins, etc.), but the general structure of the cells is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; preserved and most of the damaged components are pretty much where they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; started.  If you understand what healthy cells are supposed to look like,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and you know the chemical pathways that cause the damage, restoring the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tissue to its original state should not be a big deal.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of what fucking value is an almost undamaged brain if I cannot perfuse 
<BR>
it? If I cannot load it with sufficient amount of cryoprotectants, and 
<BR>
hence have to do a straight freeze?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Hmm.  I rather suspect that our real disagreement is here.  IMO, current
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; evidence adequately supports the assumption that information storage in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; brain is not localized - i.e. that each bit is stored as part of the pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of interconnections of a very large number of neurons, rather than in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; state of some particular part of a single cell.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Sometimes microlesions do have a visible impact. But this is
<BR>
irrelevant, because the damage is not focal. You have a veil of
<BR>
damage, on all scales (from molecular to macro) spread over the entire
<BR>
brain. Optically, it even looks relatively good. You have to look at
<BR>
EM micrographs (ultrastructural) level to see what horrible things
<BR>
happen there.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; That means that you don't need to put every atom exactly back in its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; original position to get a successful reconstruction.  The important
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking about atomic resolution in such context is the ultimate joke.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; features are relatively large, highly redundant structures containing vast
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; numbers of molecules.  Obliterating those structures beyond recognition will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; require far more damage than you would normally see - you'd have to drop the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; brain in a blender, or do something equally drastic.  I'm not sure how much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; natural decay it would take, but it seems obvious that we're talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; days or weeks rather than hours.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Ultrastructurally, you're mush after 24 h of normothermia.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If, however, you believe that all of the fine structure within an individual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cell is important, that would make the problem much more difficult.  Then
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you would have to get each molecule back to exactly its original position
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and state, so the amount of damage required to prevent reconstruction would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be much lower.  I still think, however, that you make insufficient allowance
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for the fact that reconstruction isn't limited to just looking at the frozen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tissue and following simple atom-shuffling algorithms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Belief in reversibility of anything can become a religion.
