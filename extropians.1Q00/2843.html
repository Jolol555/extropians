Yes, I understand, I often feel compelled to open my mouth about all the
<BR>
technofuture interests I have to people who may not be aware of these type
<BR>
of subjects. I find it stimulating to hear others viewpoints in response as
<BR>
well, even if it is not the same as my own. Open ears, leads to an open
<BR>
mind, which can progress to new perspectives. Or, at least give me new
<BR>
opportunities to questions I may have not considered answers for.
<BR>
The print outs, to Jello? It was two years ago, I can't recall, I used to
<BR>
carry around a backpack, with books and blah, blah, I happen to have some
<BR>
print outs from offline inside. (most likely from the foresight website,
<BR>
Engines? I'm not sure)

<P><EM>&gt; One would hope.  I think it's cool that you did that; it's a hobby of
</EM><BR>
sorts
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for me to try to get people from some of my diverse interests interested
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my other interests (wow, that was interesting).  For instance: educating
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Anarchists about nanotech, pointing the Extropians to Anarchistic
</EM><BR>
literature
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;nudge list&gt;, and Atheism for all, of course.  I'm piecing together a wee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; webpage (see below) to help facilitate such a thing; it's still in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infancy though.  Might I inquire as to what printouts you gave Jello?
