<EM>&gt; I know that one thing you can do is put 2000 a year in an educational IRA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxfree.  At least, you can do it for kids who're going to college.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should check it out.  It's not much, but it'll help.

<P>Hey!  Or you can join the Amazon insanity.  Jeff Bezos spinning from
<BR>
his man of the year and status says that Amazon has turned the corner
<BR>
and their company will finally go no deeper into debt.  This news was
<BR>
announced in a conference call to their investors after market hours
<BR>
yesterday.  Amazon stock was up over $14 today on the promise that in
<BR>
y2k1 they many actually turn a profit.  So why stop there?  If I were
<BR>
him, I'd announce a new corporate plan to take over all of e-commerce.
<BR>
Let the world's most successful e-commerce site take over your
<BR>
business's e-commerce.  If I were Amazon, I'd make damn sure I'd never
<BR>
turn a profit this century.  It's all virtual funny money tied into
<BR>
their virtual stock value.  I'd buy everything just by dilluting the
<BR>
hell out of the stock going for a corner on the whole e-commerce
<BR>
space.  Acquisition mode, here I come:
<BR>
<P>Start off in the Corporate Portal space: using their stock, buy
<BR>
Autonomy, Engenia, Portal Software, InfoImage, Nextpage, PeopleSoft,
<BR>
Plumtree, Sequoia, TopTier, Viador, 2Bridge, Appsolut, Corechage,
<BR>
Autonomy Inc., Cornus, Eloquent, Hyperware, NextPage, Semio,
<BR>
Syngergistic, Thoughtstar, and the whole corporate portal keiretsu.
<BR>
Gawd knows they are cheap enough and it wouldn't cost a lot to get
<BR>
critical mass in this particular corporate niche.
<BR>
<P>Second, start buying up all the silly little Web and server hosters,
<BR>
ESPs, TSPs, ASPs. , PSINet, US Internetworking, CMeRun, TopLayer,
<BR>
Upshot.com, Resilience, Solect, AboveNet, V2Commerce, AboveNet,
<BR>
Applicast, ArtistaSoft, bCandid, BrightStar, Candle Corporation,
<BR>
Citirx, Conxion, Cyrus, eGaiin, FutureLink, HurlNet, Enron,
<BR>
Interliant, Newbridge, NaviSite, Packeteer, Progress, Panoptic,
<BR>
Resilience, Unisphere, etc.
<BR>
<P>Third, start buying up all the e-commerce companies, everything from
<BR>
peapod.com and homegrocer.com, to Sterling Commerce, BEA Systems,
<BR>
Ariba, Digital River,Vitria, Open Market, VerticalNet, Calico,
<BR>
Selectica, Clarify, CommerceOne, etc.
<BR>
<P>Fourth, maybe people start realizing that you can't just pull money
<BR>
out of the air, but by then you'll have cornered the whole e-commerce
<BR>
space just in time for the The Great Reckoning [1] and Blood in the
<BR>
Streets [2].
<BR>
<P>Greg
<BR>
<P><P>Hell, putting $2k into PRSF and USIX alone might get you a college
<BR>
education.
