<EM>&gt; &gt; The US polio death rate was ~1/500 of the total US death rate when

<EM>&gt; &gt; the vaccine was introduced.  Not a negligible factor, but surely much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; smaller than many other influences on health.  And the other vaccines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had even smaller effects on total mortality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Every year, up to three million children's lives are saved by immunization.

<P>Worldwide 54 million people died in 1998.  So even the highest estimate
<BR>
of a pro-vaccine advocacy group were right, that would only be 5.5% of
<BR>
total mortality.  I am looking up the academic sources that site cites
<BR>
to see what evidence there is for this claim.  Of course preventing
<BR>
5.5% of deaths is a good thing, but it is far large enough to be a big
<BR>
part of the ~x3 decrease in total mortality over the last century or so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;The two public health interventions that have had the greatest impact on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world's health clean water and vaccines. ...

<EM>&gt; &gt; Medicine overall seems to have very little effect on health.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the usual answer from statistical analyses, and from the few controlled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experiments we have.

<P>Yes, you can find a lot of advocacy groups making strong claims.
<BR>
But quotes from these groups are not an adequate response to my directly
<BR>
citing evidence from the academic literature on this topic.
<BR>
<P>On the effect of medicine overall in the US, I point you to:

<BR>
Free For All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment,
<BR>
Harvard University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-674-31914-1

<P>On medicine outside the US, I point you to:

<P>On the effects of water/sanitation, I point you to:
<BR>
<P>The effects of improved nutrition, sanitation, and water quality on child
<BR>
health in high-mortality populations, by Leng-fei Lee, Mark Rosenzweig and
<BR>
Mark Pitt, J. of Econometrics, 77:209-235, 1997.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The mortality rates of most diseases treated by  antibiotics didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;change noticeably upon the introduction of that treatment. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Deaths from infectious diseases have declined markedly in the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;during the 20th century (Figure 1). This decline contributed to a sharp drop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in infant and child mortality (1,2) and to the 29.2-year increase in life

<EM>&gt;expectancy&quot;

<P>This quote doesn't contradict my statement.  And did you notice that the
<BR>
US death rate doesn't seem to fall any faster after the major medical
<BR>
events the graph indicates?
