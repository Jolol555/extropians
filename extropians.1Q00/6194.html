<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree it is in principle possible, within known physics, to copy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pattern of function and interconnection of the brain, and to implement a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; functional equivalent in some type of computer.  Such a process could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; termed &quot;copying the contents of a brain.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know if you're aware of this, but the atoms within the brain do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not remain constant.  I forget what the exact rate of turnover is, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like 50% of the atoms get replaced every six months.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever &quot;we&quot; are, it's clearly not the atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you scan in one neuron at a time, destroy the old neuron, and replace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it with a robotic interface to equivalent computations taking place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elsewhere, you can migrate, one neuron at a time, to the new substrate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without ever losing consciousness.  In this case, would it not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to say that the new individual is unambiguously &quot;you&quot;, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change of physical substrate as irrelevant as the turnover among your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constituent amino acids?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This reminds me of an old problem called &quot;Theseus' Ship.&quot;  Here is a bit about
<BR>
it from _Labyrinths of Reason_ by William Poundstone:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; When Theseus returned to Athens after slaying the Minotaur, his ship &quot;was perserved by the Athenians down even to the time of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place,&quot; wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plutarch.  &quot;This ship became a standing example among philosophers, for the logical question as to things that grow; one side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everyone concurs that replacing a plank on a ship does not change its identity.  It is still the same ship after the replacement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Replacing still another plank on the repaired ship should not make a difference either.  At some point, perhaps, Theseus' ship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contained not a single plank of the original ship.  Then surely the Athenians were deluding themselves in calling it Theseus' ship.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Had the ship not been perserved, and had the latter-day Athenians constructed a ship directly from those same nonoriginal planks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on one would dream of calling it anything but a good replica of Theseus' ship.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Which leads me to ask, what do you upload, when you upload?
