<EM>&gt; &gt; You keep restating claims like this as if they were obvious;

<EM>&gt; &gt; they aren't.  This is the issue we are arguing about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'll fall back on my Omega Point argument, because I think I can force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this one through more easily than my computability argument (though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually like that one a bit better).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Allow me to restate the claim in a more general manner.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now you want to ask which number I'll &quot;end up believing,&quot; or at least tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me some number theoretic properties about that number.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now notice that if I live forever and have an infinite number of thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... there's no way for you to tell whether my &quot;last&quot; number will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even or odd, in exactly the same respect as it would be impossible for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to determine whether the last natural number will be even or odd.

<P>Ethics is only normatively useful if it helps you make a decision, and
<BR>
decisions have deadlines.   So imagine some very important decision you
<BR>
will make in a thousand years.  There is some fact of the matter about
<BR>
what your ethical opinions will be at the time you have to make that
<BR>
decision.  Anything that helps you learn about that fact helps you in
<BR>
making your decision.  And knowing enough about those facts tells you
<BR>
everything useful that you could know.  So the only question is how to
<BR>
best arrive at estimates of those facts.
<BR>
<P>Studying the nature of human ethical reasoning should help, and should
<BR>
trying out various ethical ideas in your head and seeing how you &quot;feel&quot;
<BR>
about them.  These are admittedly very different styles of investigation,
<BR>
but they are both investigations about *facts*.  And ex post observable
<BR>
facts at that.  In this sense, all useful ethics is about empirically-
<BR>
observable facts.

<EM> &gt;above a certain level of complexity, mental systems cannot be

<EM> &gt;map satisfactorily onto a traditional notion of the realm of &quot;ethics&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think I disagree with that.
