<EM>&gt; This is why the example of the cable descrambler is right on target.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ads say that you can buy all the parts, put it together, but don't plug it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in and use it.  When they get in trouble for selling illegal cable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; descrambler, they claim that they had no way of knowing that someone might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use it to descramble cable.

<P>Unless there is a law against selling such kits, they've done nothing wrong.

It is going to be *very* interesting to see how the suit/injunction against
<BR>
people distributing the DVD copying software plays out.
<BR>
<P>It is really silly for the government to try to contain these things.  They
<BR>
just move upstream (the distribution of the plans is back to a freedom of
<BR>
speech issue as would be pointing out various sources for the parts).  There
<BR>
is also the fact that though you can regulate the sale in the U.S., there
<BR>
may be no regulation against purchasing such devices/kits overseas.  So all
<BR>
you can do is push the point of sale around.  As we become more and more
<BR>
&quot;international&quot; hopefully governments will start to realize that their
<BR>
regulatory efforts will become increasingly thwarted.
<BR>
<P>If you look at the history -- Cable descramblers, Satellite decoders,
<BR>
DVD players and even strong encryption, if its around long enough,
<BR>
sooner or later someone will break it and make the information available.
<BR>
Entertainment producers should consider an alternate model -- producing
<BR>
the things in large enough quantitites at low enough costs that they
<BR>
make the same amount because people who would not otherwise buy it
<BR>
can now afford to do so.  They might sell more than 4x as many DVDs at $5 than
<BR>
they would at $20.  If they make the costs low enough, they reduce any
<BR>
incentives for people to do the copying themselves.  The volume producer
<BR>
should be able to produce things the cheapest and therefore undercut
<BR>
any small-scale copiers.
