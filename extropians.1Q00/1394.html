<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Well, only the rich kids drop E. These are certainly nice, mellow,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;floaty kids who hug a lot. The underdogs however do crack, crank,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crystal meth. These are not mellow drugs.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;MDMA is certainly not innocuous, btw. Certainly not the right cure
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;for testosterone rage.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It seems that dance-induced hyperthermia alone might be insufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to explain MDMA-related deaths. The drug might fiddle with body
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;thermal control.
</EM><BR>
<P>I may not have sufficiently complete data here, but it seems that
<BR>
lots of poor kids save all money they can for an E pill even if they
<BR>
don't have enough cash left to buy water at a rave.  If the govt's
<BR>
efforts didn't make Ecstasy more expensive than (and maybe laced with)
<BR>
crack and didn't keep dancing places deprived of ventilation and water,
<BR>
most of the cited bad effects would be at least diminished.
<BR>
<P>It appears that rave culture plays the role that starts resembling
<BR>
that of hippie movement, in the life of the young generation, 
<BR>
replacing the religious influence with direct (and understood, and
<BR>
personally managed) perception of alternate emotional states 
<BR>
(the effect of it in shaking out &quot;fixed&quot; attitudes to life can
<BR>
hardly be exaggerated), filling the whole in social agenda that 
<BR>
doesn't seem to offer any goals to the normal population 
<BR>
(American &quot;dream&quot; is gone if it ever attracted anybody;
<BR>
dangers are gone; saving for a new refrigerator or becoming
<BR>
an upload are not realistic choices) that still needs some
<BR>
feeling of emotional fulfillment and completeness.
<BR>
<P>There are millions of young people filling the existential void with
<BR>
music, dance, and drugs - unfortunately for them, in dirty conditions,
<BR>
and under persecution that definitely hurts more &quot;users&quot; (of at least,
<BR>
MDMA) than it &quot;cures&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The attitude of the govt is clearly demonstrated by the efforts
<BR>
spent on blanket persecution of the culture it doesn't bother
<BR>
to understand.
<BR>
<P>Whatever the consequences of any particular substances (and I
<BR>
don't advocate anything to anybody), there definitely should be
<BR>
cases when adult people should be allowed to make their own
<BR>
decisions.   Would you see any reason why a person in a terminal
<BR>
stage of cancer or a few hours before an electric chair, or somebody
<BR>
who just lost a child, or is seriously considering suicide, should
<BR>
not be allowed to take MDMA?
<BR>
<P>The govt not only severely persecutes all cases, refusing to listen
<BR>
to any justification; it prohibits all chemical research, all social
<BR>
experimentation, and suppresses all alternative views on the issues.
<BR>
According to the existing drug laws, tens of millions of Americans
<BR>
are serious criminals, at least for pot smoking.  That's crazy.
<BR>
<P>For every kid dehydrated from happy dancing there are a thousand
<BR>
who were thrown into jail and raped there by hard criminals,
<BR>
millions who live in fear, and billions of dollars floating
<BR>
from the kids' hands to mafia, jail industry and corrupt cops.
<BR>
<P>Coca-Cola, over-sugared cereals, and greasy hamburgers
<BR>
definitely take a greater toll on life than pot or Ecstasy.  
<BR>
Not to mention alcohol and tobacco.  
<BR>
<P>Reading perfectly legal tabloids definitely warps one's
<BR>
perception of reality more than an occasional acid trip.
<BR>
Not to mention religion. 
<BR>
<P>The U.S. gov't insists that in Cambodia the murderers of 
<BR>
millions of people are left in peace, but pot growers are
<BR>
severely punished.
<BR>
<P>There are thousands of drugs approved for use that modify every
<BR>
human function available.  Only the ones that modify perception
<BR>
of the world or one's emotional states are somehow always harmful.
<BR>
<P>There is no justification for the current persecution, and while
<BR>
it continues, I do not expect any informed and moral individual to
<BR>
side with the gov't.
<BR>
<P>Of course, it is hard to be informed when there is no research
<BR>
on harmless use of drugs, and no serious public discussion of
<BR>
the issues.
<BR>
<P>The whole issue very much reminds me of Russian persecution of
<BR>
all sources of information that could give anybody an alternative
<BR>
perception of reality.    It blew up under a growing tide of
<BR>
technological possibilities of generating, copying, and
<BR>
distributing information, and ever greater access to it by
<BR>
the population.   Biochemistry here follows the footsteps of
<BR>
information technology - with, I believe, the same technological
<BR>
and social imperatives.   The Soviet regime that could not
<BR>
take the risks of allowing the inevitable changes incrementally,
<BR>
was obliterated when the pressure rose too high.
<BR>
<P>We'll see what happens with technological growth and social freedoms
<BR>
this time.    So far they repeat the path.
<BR>
<P>I would hate to see the current persecutors of freedom to take
<BR>
lucrative positions in the after-shock power structures, as it
<BR>
happened in Russia.  Somewhere, they should be driven through
<BR>
the same pain as their victims.
<BR>
<P><P>[ I probably should stay away from these discussions.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a non-citizen, I may be persecuted in U.S. for as much
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as advocating polygamy - the practice endangering the very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;core of the American society, apparently, and thus worthy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of persecution and suspension of free speech.   Yuck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which once again puts me in a position where I can't freely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advocate social freedoms I believe in, let alone try them.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I HATE that. ]
