<P><EM> &gt; Get used to it.  Privacy is a thing of the present, but not of the future.  
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a pretty strong statement.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'm a firm believe that information (*all* information) wants to be free.  
</EM><BR>
<P>That's another strong statement. But no evidence forthcoming so
<BR>
far. If it's a physical law, can you prove it? Do darwin in machina
<BR>
runs indicate a trend towards that?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Security and privacy are mutually exclusive when you think about it and in 
</EM><BR>
<P>1) I don't quite agree
<BR>
2) So what? This clearly means there is no absolute security, ever. 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the battle between the two I'm sure security will win out in the end.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; foresee a future where all information is available about everyone.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can get my bits, but you have to pry them from my cold, dead
<BR>
hands. You can be sure that other similiarly-minded will put up quite
<BR>
a fight. Technology giveth, technology taketh away. Do not pry into
<BR>
affairs of others, because you're crunchy, and good with ketchup.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I know this can be shocking to our 20th Century sensibilities, but really it 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; won't be such a bad thing to be so totally exposed when everyone is equally 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; exposed.  The fact that you inhaled, or cheated on a test, or posted an 
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, some will be more exposed than the others. Hmm, where have
<BR>
we heard that line before...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; embarrassingly inane rant in alt.erotica.bestiality, or fell behind in your 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Visa payments will not really matter much when it becomes a matter of public 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; record that everyone else has done the same things.  There is certainly a 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; skeleton or two in my closet, but I wouldn't mind showing you mine if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; had to show me yours too.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not logical, captain. I like my skeletons just fine where they are.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; In fact (aha! The lightbulb flashes), this may be just what we were looking 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for.  A way to allow Joe Q. Public access to a near-anything-box, without 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; having to fear that he will cause the dreaded gray goo problem.  By Jove 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I've got it!  All surveilance all the time!
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolute surveilance is an absolute impossibility. Even given
<BR>
extremely invasive measures like in Vinge's &quot;A Deepness in the
<BR>
Sky&quot;. However, theirs is a construed society. Interstellar travel yet
<BR>
no nano? Yeah, sure. Only the core/periphery deus ex machina can
<BR>
plausibly maintain this.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Every act, every conversation (heck every thought, if possible) digitally 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; recorded forever and accessible to everyone.  Based upon a lifetime's worth 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of such data it would probably a fairly easy matter to determine who could 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and could not be trusted to have their very own near-anything-box (&quot;NAB&quot;).  
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; If we can come up with a reliable Halperinesque truth machine, our fears 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about our neighbors having NAB's could be eliminated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Luckily, the truth machine is as impossible as perfect surveillance.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; So what do you think, would you be willing to give up all privacy in 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; exchange for the privilege of having access to a NAB?  Would such a 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; transparent society necessarily resolve our nano-related security concerns?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
No way. Especially because Pandora's nano box will be opened before
<BR>
BigBrother++ can be installed, and will blow away all high hopes of
<BR>
anal-retentive control freaks.
