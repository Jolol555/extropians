<P><EM>&gt; What is probably implied by this study is that the more one interacts on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net, the less 'real' or 'in the flesh' interactions with people.  Sure, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can definitely grow intellectually on the net, particularly among the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian/nano group of people, but emotional sustenance, and your ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychologically interact with family, friends, and others is definitely not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be enhanced by spending lots of time reading and e-mailing on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net.
</EM><BR>
<P>What the study's developers did not account for was the fact that because the net
<BR>
allows individuals to develop contacts from a much larger pool of potential
<BR>
contacts, they are far more likely to develop contacts which are more fulfilling
<BR>
and productive than the limited contacts that many people are restricted to in
<BR>
their local area. Because of the smaller local pool, the overall quality, and
<BR>
sorted quality is far below what net contacts offer, so they are paid less
<BR>
attention.
<BR>
<P>That being said, from my own experience, I have only a few freinds locally that I
<BR>
spend time with, and they have been freinds for many years. Outside of that small
<BR>
core group, most of my freinds are a result of meeting in the flesh people I met
<BR>
here or on the &gt;H mail list.
<BR>
<P>The study's main flaw is in valuing quantity over quality.
