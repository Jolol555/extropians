<P><EM>&gt; Don: I also find that scene deeply stirring. You might be interested to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  know that you can find the dialogue you quoted at the back of the very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  first issue of Extropy magazine (the paper edition in 1998).
</EM><BR>
<P>A slip of the finger there, Max.  The first issue of Extropy Magazine was 
<BR>
published in 1988 - by you and Tom.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The problem with Wells was that he seemed to be a bit of a technocrat--in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the sense that he thought a scientific elite should run things for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  citizens. It's been a long time since I read any Wells, so maybe I'm being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  unfair to him (someone please correct me if so). He seems quite extropian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  expect in that my impression was that he looked down on the masses (the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lumpen-proletariat as the Leninists would say) as incapable of creating 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their own future. Aside from that, he gave a powerful message of humanist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and technological optimism.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're being too fair by far to Wells regarding his politics, I'm afraid.  
<BR>
Wells was one of the founders, and because of his popularity as a writer, one 
<BR>
of the most well-known members of the Fabian Society:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~lisjpo/fabian.htm">http://www.bath.ac.uk/~lisjpo/fabian.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>As the condensed little essay cited above chronicles, the Fabians were a 
<BR>
group of very influential, but very explicit socialists in England.  I find 
<BR>
reading Wells' political writings excruciating, as they were exactly the kind 
<BR>
of misguided technocratic commandism that seduced most of the best minds of 
<BR>
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and which led so tragically to the 
<BR>
enslavement and organized murder of hundreds of millions of people.  To me, 
<BR>
his political writings are like spent ordinance lying on a bloody battlefield.
<BR>
<P>Of course I didn't know any of this when I read &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;War 
<BR>
of the Worlds&quot; as a kid.  A couple of years ago I was driving through the 
<BR>
coastal area south of London and passed through the little town of Tunbridge 
<BR>
Wells.  The hair on the back of my head (some of the little still *in situ*) 
<BR>
stood on end, as I recalled that this was the setting of the arrival of the 
<BR>
first Martian invaders in &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.  (The same thing happened 
<BR>
about ten years earlier when I drove through Grover's Mill, New Jersey - the 
<BR>
place that the other Welles set the same event in his radio broadcaast based 
<BR>
on the book . . .)
