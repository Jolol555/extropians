Subject:	Re: what it's like to be uploaded
<BR>
<P>I've been thinking about uploading for about thirty years since reading
<BR>
Arthur C. Clarke's book Profiles of the Future-in particular the chapter
<BR>
entitled 'The Obsolescence of Man'. That changed my perspective completely.
<BR>
(And my 'metaphysics' as well. I learned in that book to see the world in
<BR>
terms of information patterns, processes and systems, instead of substances
<BR>
and entities.)The only other book in the same mind-blowing league for me was
<BR>
Eric Drexler's Engines of Creation.
<BR>
<P>Zero Powers point about communication is an important part of it. Think of
<BR>
the flow of information inside a brain compared to the meager bandwidth
<BR>
outside-words, spoken or written, with a major assist in some regards from
<BR>
art.
<BR>
<P>I think it's clear that government in any sense that we've known it will be
<BR>
a thing of the past-we don't need ruler nerve cells for a brain to function.
<BR>
With this kind of bandwidth we won't need rulers for society either.
<BR>
<P>Psychology will become a mature science and engineering discipline, applied
<BR>
to making real changes in people. We will certainly need that before we will
<BR>
be able to handle the profound intimacy we have to look forward to. Virtual
<BR>
reality will be an important tool for 'growth scenarios': revisiting the
<BR>
past and replacing dysfunctional (or at least non-optimal) emotional
<BR>
patterns with better choices. The individual will be in charge and will be
<BR>
facilitated in making those changes with nanorobots adjusting synapses
<BR>
appropriately. (My personal name for this technology: the Dickens
<BR>
Facilitator, after Charles Dickens' invention of the three Christmas spirits
<BR>
who facilitated the transformation of one Ebenezer Scrooge. But there won't
<BR>
be anything spooky about this...or on second thought, maybe there will.) I
<BR>
think we will start with relatively superficial adjustments. That should be
<BR>
sufficient to change the general human condition to one described by words
<BR>
like self-actuated, happy, loving, benevolent, purposeful and rational. When
<BR>
we've learned enough (and with AI to assist, that might not take long) we
<BR>
might look at modifying the deep architecture of  the human mind / brain.
<BR>
First we need to know what it is that we want. We'll learn that in
<BR>
successive stages. I think we need to achieve such a stable emotional
<BR>
foundation before we subject it to the strain of major augmentations of
<BR>
intelligence and senses. Otherwise I'm afraid to think what kind of
<BR>
psychopathy we might unleash in the world.
<BR>
<P>Most of my thoughts about sensory augmentation center around the visual
<BR>
sense. The farthest out for me has been a notion that 'objects of the
<BR>
mind'-from ideas to music-might exist in a kind of visual space where they
<BR>
could be 'seen'. I had a kind of spark of recognition when I saw Eliezer
<BR>
Yudkowsky's description of the 'codic cortex'. Other things that have come
<BR>
to mind are higher-dimensional visualization, transperspective vision and
<BR>
transmetric vision. The latter two essentially would involve the ability to
<BR>
combine things we see separately into seemingly continuous wholes.
