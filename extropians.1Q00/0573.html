<P>I published the following in the NYT on 1/3/00. I am curious about the 
<BR>
deafening silence with which the Internet community has greeted this issue. I 
<BR>
have my theories as to the reasons, but am curious about others'.

<P>Sometimes the Patient Knows Best 
<BR>
<P>By Virginia Postrel 
<BR>
<P>January 3, 2000
<BR>
<P>LOS ANGELES -- The Internet's abundance -- of information, goods, tastes 
<BR>
and sources of authority -- creates unparalleled opportunities for 
<BR>
individuals to get exactly what they want. But this plenitude threatens 
<BR>
political and cultural authorities who believe in telling individuals 
<BR>
what they can have rather than letting them choose for themselves. It 
<BR>
was inevitable, therefore, that the growth of the Internet would lead to 
<BR>
complaints that its diversity undermines media standards, traditional 
<BR>
morality and political authority. It was inevitable that the Internet 
<BR>
would face calls for censorship. 
<BR>
<P>And it was equally inevitable that the Internet would clash with 
<BR>
American pharmaceutical regulations. The United States government 
<BR>
approaches patient choice in medication as Singapore does free speech: 
<BR>
its pronouncements sound reasonable and tolerant until you threaten its 
<BR>
prerogatives. 
<BR>
<P>The Internet ethos of diversity and competition runs exactly counter to 
<BR>
uniform, gatekeeper-oriented medical culture -- the technocratic 
<BR>
philosophy of the &quot;one best way&quot; embodied in our pharmaceutical 
<BR>
regulations. On the Net, medical information is abundant and pharmacies, 
<BR>
domestic and foreign, operate on many different models. 
<BR>
<P>Now President Clinton is calling for new laws to require pharmacy Web 
<BR>
sites to get licenses from the Food and Drug Administration before they 
<BR>
can go online. He also wants large new federal fines, up to $500,000 per 
<BR>
sale, for selling prescription drugs &quot;without a valid prescription.&quot; 
<BR>
Determining what's &quot;valid&quot; would put the federal government in the 
<BR>
business of regulating medical practice. To enforce these new rules, the 
<BR>
administration would give the F.D.A. subpoena powers and $10 million in 
<BR>
fiscal 2001. 
<BR>
<P>The Clinton initiative would greatly expand federal control over 
<BR>
cyberspace while nationalizing state-level pharmacy regulations and 
<BR>
common law standards of medical care. High-profile, 
<BR>
venture-capital-backed Internet pharmacies like Drugstore.com and Planet
<BR>
Rx.com support the initiative's general philosophy and goals but have 
<BR>
expressed concern about whether new federal powers are necessary. They 
<BR>
favor stricter enforcement of existing laws. These sites operate within 
<BR>
traditional procedures, requiring a prescription from the patient's 
<BR>
personal physician. 
<BR>
<P>But other online pharmacies let customers fill out questionnaires about 
<BR>
their health and get prescriptions from doctors without in-person exams. 
<BR>
<P>These sites range from shadowy operations without known addresses to 
<BR>
well-established brick-and-mortar businesses like the Pill Box, a 
<BR>
five-store chain based in San Antonio. They tend to specialize in 
<BR>
so-called lifestyle drugs like the anti-impotence treatment Viagra and 
<BR>
the anti-baldness drug Propecia. 
<BR>
<P>The Food and Drug Administration calls them rogue sites, and government 
<BR>
officials claim they victimize customers. Janet Woodcock, director of 
<BR>
the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told a House 
<BR>
committee in July: &quot;A system of drug regulation was established in this 
<BR>
country that has served us well. But even with this system in place, 
<BR>
there are those who still try to sell unapproved or unsafe drug 
<BR>
products, and the Internet provides them with new opportunities for 
<BR>
reaching unsuspecting and vulnerable consumers and undermining 
<BR>
established safeguards,&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Fraudulent operators exist, of course, but their products and practices 
<BR>
are well covered by existing laws. The threat to the power of regulators 
<BR>
comes from sites that benefit customers who don't feel well served by 
<BR>
the established system. A significant number of Americans obviously 
<BR>
prefer the privacy and convenience of a Web-based medical consultation 
<BR>
to the invasiveness and hassle of a physician visit. 
<BR>
<P>While they may go to the doctor for diagnosis and treatment of 
<BR>
conventional illnesses, these consumers don't see their sex lives or 
<BR>
baldness as requiring physical exams. Regulators also tend to idealize 
<BR>
in-person exams, as though every doctor took a careful history and 
<BR>
thoroughly examined a patient before prescribing any drug. 
<BR>
<P>The White House claims that &quot;in cyberspace, consumers have no way of 
<BR>
telling whether an online pharmacy is a legitimate operation.&quot; This 
<BR>
isn't true. Brand reputations, contact numbers and street addresses, and 
<BR>
a pharmacy association certification program are all indicators that a 
<BR>
business is sound. 
<BR>
<P>The F.D.A. itself offers useful advice to help consumers evaluate 
<BR>
pharmacy sites. The real issue is that not all consumers agree on what 
<BR>
is &quot;legitimate.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Internet pharmacies return to consumers the choice promised by 
<BR>
supporters of the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. That law established 
<BR>
federal requirements for drug safety and labeling but exempted 
<BR>
prescription medicines from the labeling rules. 
<BR>
<P>The bill was sold as a way to help consumers make informed choices about 
<BR>
their medications, not as a way to transfer those choices to physicians, 
<BR>
drug makers and regulators. The goal, W. G. Campbell, then head of the 
<BR>
F.D.A., told a Senate committee, was merely &quot;to make self-medication 
<BR>
safe.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The government broke that promise. As the Massachusetts Institute of 
<BR>
Technology economist Peter Temin recounted in &quot;Taking Your Medicine,&quot; 
<BR>
his 1980 book on drug regulation, &quot;The agency moved within six months of 
<BR>
the bill's passage to curtail self-medication sharply and thereafter 
<BR>
used a substantial and increasing proportion of its drug resources to 
<BR>
enforce its imposed limitations.&quot; The agency created a new class of 
<BR>
medicines that could be sold only by prescription -- a category that has 
<BR>
greatly expanded over the succeeding decades. In doing so, Mr. Temin 
<BR>
wrote, it &quot;appointed doctors as the consumers' purchasing agents.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Internet partially restores patients' rights to choose how they buy 
<BR>
their medications and from whom. No wonder the drug censors are so 
<BR>
upset.
