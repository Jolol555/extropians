<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Since the powerful will have greater computational resources, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;be able to make better use of the intelligence value of this ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;surveillance, so even if everyone has the same 'access' (or even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;powerful have 'less' access, they will still make better use of the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and will be able to oppress people more as a result. Surveillance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;merely an intelligence gathering channel. Its value is directly related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to how much you can process in a given amount of time, and how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;useless data you can filter out. Unless you are going to mandate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;everyone have exactly the same amount of computing power, no more, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;less, then your scheme cannot work as you envision it, and it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;become a tool of repression for the powerful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once again, not really.  It doesn't take much computing power at all to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; browse an efficiently designed and frequently updated database.  Each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; citizen would not have to bear the onerous burden of creating and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maintaining their own database.  The database would be publicly maintained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (of course under the glare of a great deal of transparency).  When I wanted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the info, I'd just cruise on over to the database, log in and have a look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around.  Not much different than what happens now when you go to google.com.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I would not have much advantage using a 1ghz Pentium III over somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using a 66mhz 486 in browsing such a database.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You obviously do not comprehend the scope of the problem at hand. We are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking the ability to monitor and filter the input of MILLIONS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras, giving real=time output of deeds being done. The computer that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can do that has not been built yet, and when it is YOU won't the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person to get one, it will be the government and the big corporations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me amend myself. Assuming this is a worldwide system, you are talking a
<BR>
minimum of 100 - 500 billion cameras. Zero's Pentium III is capable of filtering
<BR>
the input of between 1-6 such cameras. So Zero would not have the same processing
<BR>
capability of, say, IBM, which could filter the input of maybe a few million
<BR>
cameras. Keep in mind that each camera will also have to have a built in video
<BR>
server (to ensure that the video feed isn't being altered in transit), and a
<BR>
router capable of handling terabytes of bandwidth, at a minimum, due to download
<BR>
requests from over 6 billion people. We are not talking little consumer web-cams
<BR>
here.
<BR>
<P>Total open ubiquitous surveillance is not only technically impossible, unless you
<BR>
create a techno-socialist state that says each person can only have the same
<BR>
processing capability of anyone else, and that individuals cannot collaborate on
<BR>
distributed processing projects, then it is also not equal either. The powerful
<BR>
will always find such systems to be of more use for maintaining power and
<BR>
supporting oppression than the average person will find it for supporting freedom.
