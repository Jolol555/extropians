<P>&lt;&lt; I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman Sow. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Incredible movie. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean you haven't got a DVD player yet?  Oh Randy get with the times 
<BR>
video is sooooo 2nd Millennium.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget who came up with that line but I thought it was priceless.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a great movie though isn't it.  As far as acting, Carrey blew 
<BR>
Truman away when he played Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;When Truman came up against the wall at 
<BR>
the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death, 
<BR>
although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so 
<BR>
inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can relate to that too.  Very often when people bring up the topic of 
<BR>
death, I will inevitably mention that death &quot;may&quot; not be inevitable.  When I 
<BR>
try to explain that it is really just a problem with biology and it can be 
<BR>
corrected, I usually get a look as if I just tore off my face and reveled 
<BR>
some terrifying Sci Fi creature.  I never understood why this should come as 
<BR>
a shock to people these days.  As a species human kind has been searching for 
<BR>
the answer to immortality from the moment we realized that we are alive.  We 
<BR>
have been searching for answers and now we are coming up with answers that 
<BR>
don't involve having to die to get there.  Seems to me that there should be 
<BR>
less &quot;faith&quot; involved in physical immortality than the leap of faith or 
<BR>
gamble that there may be a spiritual after life involving a transference into 
<BR>
another dimension, an alternate reality or even an unseen UFO in the tail of 
<BR>
a comet.  To me these are no longer valid options.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the old why would anyone want to live forever refrain. If 
<BR>
someone truly does not care if they die than they are not really living to 
<BR>
begin with.  Ask the same person if they would be willing to die tomorrow and 
<BR>
the answer is almost always &quot;no&quot;.  It should be obvious... That is the whole 
<BR>
point!  Perhaps it's just another step in evolution or natures way of 
<BR>
choosing it's Immortals.
