Ad Astropians,
<BR>
<P>Re the tower-jump-to-orbit maneuver, or the minimum altitude for

zero-rocket-assist orbital insertion:

<P><EM>&gt;It was my impression that if one wanted a reasonably circular orbit, the
</EM><BR>
only altitude one could
<BR>
<EM>&gt;jump into orbit from is the altitude of goesynchronous orbit. With any
</EM><BR>
lower altitude, you need a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;lot more sideways velocity for a circular orbit then sitting at the top of
</EM><BR>
a tower that tall gives
<BR>
<EM>&gt;you. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I emailed Darin a little note, to wit:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Spike didn't say that the orbit was circular.   &lt;snip&gt;... the orbit is
</EM><BR>
elliptical.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're right, that a jump from a geosynchronous-orbit-tall tower will give
</EM><BR>
you a circular orbit.  &gt;In fact, all you have to do is raise your feet off
<BR>
the platform, cause, hey, you and the platform 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;are already in orbit.  No jumping to it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Then spike replied (to Darin, not to me):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That's a good question, one that I want to work on. If one went up about
</EM><BR>
an earth diameter on a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;cable and let go, what would be the shape of that orbit? Also, I have
</EM><BR>
sharpened my calcs a bit
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and found that the whole question of climbing a cable and letting go to
</EM><BR>
get into a minimal orbit
<BR>
<EM>&gt;might be wrong: I found a flaw in my reasoning today.
</EM><BR>
<P>So I puzzled over it for a week, and found no flaw in spike's reasoning,
<BR>
or, to be more precise, no flaw in his conclusion.  Quite elegant, actually.
<BR>
<P>According to Kepler and Newton all planetary orbits are elliptical (a
<BR>
circle being a special case of an ellipse), with the center of the orbited
<BR>
planet located at one of the foci.  If one is considering orbits around the
<BR>
earth, then the earth is at one focus.  If one then imagines an earth-sized
<BR>
sphere adjacent to the earth, its center defines a second focus, and the
<BR>
furthest out point on the earth-sized sphere--the point diametrically
<BR>
opposite the point of contact between the earth-sized sphere and the real
<BR>
earth--can be chosen to define one point--the extreme end--of an ellipse.
<BR>
Then, by symmetry the other end of the ellipse just grazes the atmosphere
<BR>
at the far side of the real earth.  Now, by Newton and Kepler, this ellipse
<BR>
is a valid earth orbit, and the condition of it grazing the atmosphere of
<BR>
the real earth makes it the minimum viable orbit for the condition of
<BR>
climbing the tower and just letting go.  Thus, one comes up with the
<BR>
earth-diameter high tower that spike derived.  Stepping off the tower at
<BR>
that height corresponds to entering the orbit at the apogee. Just grazing
<BR>
the earth at the other end is the perigee.  Nifty.  
<BR>
