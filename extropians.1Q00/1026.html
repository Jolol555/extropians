Conservative columnist George Will writes today about the controversy
<BR>
over using aborted fetus cells in stem cell research.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-01/20/110l-012000-idx.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-01/20/110l-012000-idx.html</A>
<BR>
(That URL probably won't last long.)
<BR>
<P>He actually takes a rather mild view, complaining that the public
<BR>
university doing this is not taking into consideration the feelings of a
<BR>
substantial portion of the public.  He then goes on to discuss the future:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In 10 to 15 years, Smith surmises, scientists will be able to take a cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from an individual's skin, de-differentiate it, and manipulate it into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a source for various living tissues. In fact, last month researchers at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston reported that undifferentiated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells from muscles of adult mice have a &quot;remarkable capacity&quot; to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transformed into blood cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; President Smith assumes, plausibly, that mature human cells soon will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have, with an assist from science, this capacity. Certainly what seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remarkable in one decade becomes routine in the next.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A disquieting era of genetic manipulation is coming, one that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revolutionize human capacities, and notions of health. If we treat moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scruples impatiently, as inherently retrograde in a scientifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advancing civilization, we will not be in moral trim when--soon--our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very humanity depends on our being in trim.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately Will takes up most of his space explaining the current
<BR>
controversy, without elaborating on his cryptic last paragraph.  What does
<BR>
it mean to be in &quot;moral trim&quot;, such that our very humanity depends on it?
<BR>
<P>One would think that the ability to turn mature cells into stem cells
<BR>
(what Will calls &quot;undifferentiated&quot; cells) would actually help with the
<BR>
moral dilemma.  There would no longer be a need to use aborted fetuses
<BR>
for medical research or even medical therapy.  Right to lifers would
<BR>
not have to balance the evil of promoting abortion against the good of
<BR>
life-enhancing medical treatments from stem cells.
<BR>
<P>Will wrote last June about post-humanism in
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.sacbee.com/voices/national/will/more/will_19990617.html">http://www.sacbee.com/voices/national/will/more/will_19990617.html</A>.  He is
<BR>
a representative of &quot;old school&quot; conservatism (a conservative approach to
<BR>
conservatism, as compared to the radical fire-breathing conservatives).
<BR>
As such he may be a bridge between the extremists on the far right and
<BR>
the technologists who are carrying us forward.
