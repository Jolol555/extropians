<P><EM>&gt; Hal!  Your post led me to a most wonderful insight:  the life expectancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tables that most people take for granted and use plan their own lives are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  based on propaganda by the one industry that profits from our collective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pessimism: the insurance company!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If State Farm can convince you that you will probably kick it around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  75, you are far more likely to pay their rates for life insurance!  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  keep paying, as 75 comes and goes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been working on a series of cases for various life insurance companies 
<BR>
for the last five years.  In the process I've learned a little bit about the 
<BR>
techniques of that most cold-blooded of statistician, the life insurance 
<BR>
actuary.  Among the basic tools of the actuary are what is called &quot;mortality 
<BR>
tables&quot;.  There seem to be two components to these tables, publicly-available 
<BR>
tables compiled and published by industry groups, and closely-guarded 
<BR>
proprietary tables maintained by each company's own actuaries.  The latter 
<BR>
refine the information and calculations available in the former, based on the 
<BR>
company's own experience with the specific demographic &quot;slices&quot; to whom 
<BR>
they've sold insurance.  
<BR>
<P>Depending on conditions in the general economy and the specific competitive 
<BR>
environment for particular demographic segments, &quot;mortality margins&quot; defining 
<BR>
the core cost of insurance component of whole and universal life policies can 
<BR>
be razor-thin.  In key market segments (high-wage earners in the First World 
<BR>
and other wealthy people) competitive pressures drive actuaries to work their 
<BR>
calculations to the edge of profitability.  Thus, I find your statement above 
<BR>
to be wrong: Any attempt by one life insurance company to overstate mortality 
<BR>
rates will be quickly exploited by competitors.
