<P>Biotech Starts 2000 With a Bang as Recent Gains Rival Internet Stocks;
<BR>
CEO &amp; Investor Conference to Showcase Industry to New Investors
<BR>
<P>January 21, 2000
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ via NewsEdge Corporation - Recent
<BR>
gains in biotechnology stocks have rivaled the performance of Internet
<BR>
companies, signaling renewed and expanded investor interest in the
<BR>
biotechnology industry.
<BR>
<P>For the first two weeks in January, the Nasdaq Biotech Index recorded
<BR>
an increase of 13.47 percent while TheStreet.com Internet Index
<BR>
registered a decrease of 4 percent.
<BR>
<P>The Biotechnology Industry Organization's (BIO) second annual CEO &amp;
<BR>
Investor Conference Feb. 15-16, 2000, in New York offers the
<BR>
opportunity to meet the biotech industry's leaders. The conference at
<BR>
the Waldorf Astoria will showcase a full spectrum of companies'
<BR>
activities.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Biotechnology is revolutionizing drug discovery, offering enormous
<BR>
potential benefits for public health,&quot; said BIO President Carl
<BR>
B. Feldbaum. &quot;Our CEO &amp; Investor Conference offers a close look at
<BR>
companies involved in the latest research and development of drugs and
<BR>
vaccines for the most life- threatening illnesses, such as heart
<BR>
disease, cancer, neurological diseases and infectious diseases.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;There is a whole new element of momentum in the recent performance of
<BR>
the biotech sector, sparked by the genomics and chip companies,&quot;
<BR>
remarked Dennis Purcell, managing director of Chase H&amp;Q, more which is
<BR>
one of 12 investment banks co-sponsoring the BIO conference.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Investors have realized that genomic and information-based biotech
<BR>
companies are addressing a tremendous commercial opportunity for drug
<BR>
discovery technologies,&quot; Purcell noted. &quot;There are great investment
<BR>
opportunities in biotechnology for new investors.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The overall health of the biotechnology sector is strong. In 1999, 22
<BR>
biotech drugs, vaccines and new indications for existing medicines
<BR>
were approved by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration. More than 350
<BR>
drugs and vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials. Biotech
<BR>
companies raised nearly $12 billion through public and private
<BR>
financings and investments from corporate partners.
<BR>
<P>In addition, the Nasdaq Biotech Index soared 102 percent during 1999,
<BR>
exceeding the 86 percent increase of the Nasdaq Composite Index, and
<BR>
rivaling the 184 percent jump in the TheStreet.com Internet Index.
<BR>
<P>About 1,200 biotech and pharmaceutical company executives, investment
<BR>
experts and investors are expected to attend BIO's CEO &amp; Investor
<BR>
Conference, titled 2000 Reasons to Invest in Biotechnology. More than
<BR>
180 companies will be showcased in 12 investor sessions, six CEO
<BR>
roundtables and an international reception featuring 50 tabletop
<BR>
exhibits.
<BR>
<P>The conference also will feature keynote lunch speeches by Dr. Jurgen
<BR>
Drews, former president of global research and development for
<BR>
F. Hoffmann-La Roche, on Feb. 15 and Dr. Judah Folkman, who discovered
<BR>
the process of tumor angiogenesis, on Feb. 16.
<BR>
<P>Dr. Folkman is director of Surgical Research Laboratories at
<BR>
Children's Hospital and professor of pediatric surgery and cell
<BR>
biology at Harvard Medical School. His discovery of how angiogenesis
<BR>
contributes to tumor growth has led to clinical testing of numerous
<BR>
drug candidates aimed at preventing the formation of blood vessels
<BR>
that feed cancers.
<BR>
<P>Dr. Drews is chairman of International Biomedicine Management Partners
<BR>
Inc., a venture investment firm. At Roche, he was responsible for the
<BR>
company's biotechnology research projects, alliances and acquisitions.
<BR>
<P>A CEO &amp; Investor Conference program, including online registration
<BR>
forms, is posted on BIO's website (www.bio.org) and on a special
<BR>
website set up for the conference (www.InvestInBio.com).
<BR>
<P>BIO represents more than 860 companies, academic institutions and
<BR>
state biotechnology centers in 47 states and 26 nations. BIO members
<BR>
are involved in the research and development of health-care,
<BR>
agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.
