Agreed.

<P><EM> &gt; What I was talking about, was normal relations between individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that didn't have any problems in animal species, and have problems
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the society now only because of the warped dynamics of processes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the human memetic pswamp  ...  
</EM><BR>
<P>Some taboos seem to be almost a universal aspect of the species.  For
<BR>
example, almost all humans have some form of nudity taboo.
<BR>
Apparently, anthropologists have discovered that bands of people who
<BR>
wear very little by the standards of, say, what won't get you arrested
<BR>
walking through Boston Commons in the middle of summer still feel
<BR>
shame about removing that little and wearing nothing at all.  Nudity
<BR>
taboos are an interesting, primal, and apparently nearly universal
<BR>
part of human psychological makeup.  Explanations for primal nudity
<BR>
taboos show up in ancient religious scriptures, for example the
<BR>
explanation in Genesis.  I've heard of religions where the explanation
<BR>
is that humans are special animals that feel most comfortable wearing
<BR>
the skins of other animals.  Clearly that's an interesting comment on
<BR>
our use of simple technologies to protect our bodies.  Still, it
<BR>
doesn't fully explain nudity taboos.
<BR>
<P>Taboos seems evidence that something about the way we've evolved has
<BR>
altered even our normative relation to our bodies by contrast with
<BR>
other animals.
<BR>
<P>Now, I would agree that it's a healthy thing for these taboos to be
<BR>
understood as mere social conventions, and not to punish people for
<BR>
violating them.  I applaud people who try to drive back state and
<BR>
social control mechanisms that enshrine nudity taboos and make a duty
<BR>
of citizenship out of obedience to them.  I've been very happy to
<BR>
observe progress in this arena throughout my life.  For example, in
<BR>
New York asymmetrical gender-based decency laws have been stricken
<BR>
down by court order.  If women have to cover their breasts, so do men.
<BR>
At a lot of public parades women go topless to assert their right to
<BR>
do so.  I've also observed that at festivals and concerts and so on
<BR>
increasingly one finds that there are clothing-optional zones.
<BR>
(Burning Man, etc.)  There's a photographer in New York who stages
<BR>
large public nude assemblages, though he lately has had trouble with
<BR>
the cops, alas.  But in general, I think puritanical social control in
<BR>
this area is abating.
<BR>
<P>But I think you'd be hard-pressed to prove that human nudity taboos
<BR>
are completely &quot;unnatural&quot;.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James
