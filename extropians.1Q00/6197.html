<EM>&gt; &gt;Regarding those cameras going up all over the place in intersections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So really all I'm asking for is the ability to look back at them.  Funny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing is that these guys who would deny me the right to keep an eye on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government like that probably think of themselves as libertarians!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<P>I think libertarians would be against the government having untrammeled
<BR>
surveillance, and that it can not be said that they would be for or against
<BR>
surveillance of the government, although I think that some would be for it as a
<BR>
method to keep tabs on those wielding power on behalf of the citizenry.
<BR>
<P>So, until all police and government officials are monitored, any monitoring of
<BR>
the citizenry is repressive as it is a means of power control.  That doesn't
<BR>
mean that government proclivity towards monitoring is unrealistic, but it can
<BR>
be seen as wrong.
<BR>
<P>So I think that all police officers then public officials should be monitored,
<BR>
if anybody, and private citizens should not be monitored.  That doesn't mean
<BR>
that there should be coptv on hundreds of thousands of channels (too many
<BR>
policemen) but that that data could be accessed in the interest of the public
<BR>
if there was ever a need.
<BR>
<P>Some might say &quot;oh then the backup tapes of questionable police activities
<BR>
would be lost&quot; but that is B.S.  Any fool who has ever restored a backup tape
<BR>
knows that regular and ordered data storage redundancy activities are simple.
<BR>
The costs of recovery would be minimal and time to restore archived data brief,
<BR>
certainly within five working days.
<BR>
<P>I have addressed this post of Zero because he addresssed a term that I used,
<BR>
libertarian, also, I wanted to clarify some things I had written.  Here's
<BR>
something funny, if suddenly today we had transparency to all citizens and a
<BR>
huge supercomputer correlated everyone, then marijuana, etc. use would probably
<BR>
be seen as quite higher than it is deemed.
<BR>
<P>One thing about data sovereignty, that is about private citizen's rights to
<BR>
limit and control access to private and valuable data that is their copyright.
<BR>
Having to do with personal data, if a company uses your address to mail your
<BR>
goods and bill you, then that is a situation where your personal information is
<BR>
required to the extent of that exact transaction.  If they sell your address or
<BR>
identified purchasing history then that out of the extent of the transaction,
<BR>
and your data has been purloined.
<BR>
<P>On the consumer side, which is what this line of argument is geared towards as
<BR>
opposed to the commercial side, in terms of credit there are some credit
<BR>
agencies, and they supposedly show all enquiries by any party into your
<BR>
credit.  This is obviously a flawed system for the people, as many places get
<BR>
some or large access to this data and it does not appear on the credit reports.
<BR>
<P>Banks should hold inviolable and strictly confidential all account information,
<BR>
e.g., the utter secrecy and trust of the Swiss banking model.  How well does
<BR>
your bank know you, and what information goes beyond your account?
<BR>
<P>Well, my litigious side says that it would be possible to file class action
<BR>
suits against personal-privacy-purloiners, the winning game scenario there is
<BR>
to be a lawyer and take one third.
<BR>
<P>So, the next you give your Taxpayer Identification Number (aka Social Security)
<BR>
to somebody, ask them to whom the attached data is ever transferred.  You might
<BR>
have to ask their supervisor.
