Better to leave the theists to their own devices until their mouths begin to 
<BR>
water watching us live in health and wealth for hundreds of years with no 
<BR>
sign from God that he's pissed off about it.-
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>They will quickly adopt advanced technologies LONG before that! lol!  They 
<BR>
will also live in health and wealth but fuse their doctrines and beliefs to 
<BR>
it.  If a cheap treatment is developed to grant near immortality, believe 
<BR>
me, the vast majority of every religious and nonreligious group will rush to 
<BR>
take it!
<BR>
<P>Millennialist beliefs will still continue, as they have for centuries.  I 
<BR>
myself believe that Christ was/is divine and is coming back.  If he does not 
<BR>
by 2100 I would start to severely doubt based on my own study and thinking.
<BR>
<P>I could see myself having an argument with a young believer from the 22nd 
<BR>
century regarding the matter, should I make it there!  He or she/IT(an 
<BR>
evangelical Christian or Mormon A.I., uplifted animal or upload, ever 
<BR>
thought of that, folks?) would tell me that I did not have all the evidence 
<BR>
back then but they do now.
<BR>
<P>I wonder how public morals will be a half or full century from now?  Imagine 
<BR>
when birth control is totally safe and failproof, when pharmaceutical 
<BR>
options to enhance desire and performance are vastly better then even now, 
<BR>
zero gee love motels are inexpensive, when sexually transmitted diseases are 
<BR>
just a memory and when people age at a much, much slower rate which 
<BR>
preserves youthfulness.
<BR>
<P>I would suspect at first a sexual revolution making the sixties and 
<BR>
seventies look tame by comparison!  And of course, you would have young 
<BR>
people or those getting out of monogomous relationships, sowing their wild 
<BR>
oats.  But, I think most people would in time settle down for a committed, 
<BR>
monogamous and loving relationship for not only having their needs met but 
<BR>
to rear a family.  There will be other forms of family but I don't see the 
<BR>
nuclear family going the way of the dinasaur.
<BR>
<P>I can see fundamentalists being outraged by such a sexual revolution.  But 
<BR>
yet, the irony would be that the temptation for them as individual members 
<BR>
and especially the young people growing up in it, would be such that great 
<BR>
care would have to be taken that there is not wholesale defection to the 
<BR>
ways of the world.
<BR>
<P>Saying you might get pregnant or get an std would no longer work.  They 
<BR>
would have to focus on doctrine and even more so on an appeal to moral 
<BR>
virtues and loyalty to God and one's present or future lifemate.  And I 
<BR>
thought the poor Hebrews had problems living next door to those 
<BR>
pleasure-loving Canaanites!
<BR>
<P>Due to the superiority of schooling for children and adults due to A.I., 
<BR>
neurohacking and just better training and funding of public education, I see 
<BR>
a Christianity which will have the intellectual means among the general 
<BR>
membership to view fundamental matters such as historical truth, the nature 
<BR>
and existance of God, evolution, ethics and other subjects in a way no 
<BR>
previous generation has had.
<BR>
<P>I do not see Christianity fading away.  But the schisms within it will 
<BR>
increase even more so and on a grand scale.  Acceptance or rejection of key 
<BR>
ideas and technologies will fuel this.  I hope not but we may see wars of 
<BR>
words and even physical violence unleashed on us over these ideological 
<BR>
differences.  Will we see conflict that will echo of the reformation or 
<BR>
enlightenment?
<BR>
<P>Even a race of near-immortals with nanotech-empowered godlike powers will 
<BR>
still, at least among a sizeable portion of the population, desire to 
<BR>
develop their spirituality in ways reminiscent of the past.  They will see 
<BR>
Jesus Christ as a great exemplar whether or not they accept his divinity.  
<BR>
And at least some will wonder, in their age of splendor, if Christ was 
<BR>
divine and will return to chastise their world for it's pride and sin, 
<BR>
though it may not be fashionable in such a place to speak that.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
