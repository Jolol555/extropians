To clarify, the FLIR video and events I speak of 
<BR>
in the text below refer to the April 19, 1993 FLIR,
<BR>
NOT to yesterday's tests. Mike McNulty's new video 
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://Waco-ANewRevelation.com">http://Waco-ANewRevelation.com</A>) shows the footage 
<BR>
from the 1993 Waco FLIR where you CAN see the agents 
<BR>
doing the shooting, which you can see for the reasons 
<BR>
stated below. This critical fact is being avoided by 
<BR>
the Govt and the major media. We are instead being 
<BR>
led to assume shooters are never visible in the 
<BR>
1993 FLIR video, which is a false assumption.
<BR>
<P>Shooters are visible sometimes in the 1993 FLIR, and 
<BR>
the reasons why they are visible when they are and 
<BR>
why they are not when they are not are explained by 
<BR>
predictable consequences of temperature conditions;
<BR>
there's really no room in logic for the Govt spin,
<BR>
and those in the media are capable of knowing this.

<EM>&gt;   However, as McNulty's latest video shows, two gunmen 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   CAN be seen with muzzle flashes occurring exactly in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   front of them, and these gunmen just exited a tank,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   unlike the gunmen inherently in the other positions. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   These gunmen can be seen as black, human-shaped objects 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   since their clothing is cooler than the ground because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   they just exited the air-conditioned tank. The fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is if you see these flashes of light, they're quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   obviously gun shots, they flash a rates equal to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   machine gun and you can see their pear shape, ie, they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   are wide at the muzzle end and taper in the direction 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the gun is being fired. As the fire starts, you can also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   see embers flashing as they blow in the wind. There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   an unmistakable difference between the gun flashes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and the flashes of embers blowing away from the fire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   You never see any glints of light in the large fields 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   of building debris, nor do you ever see reflections of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the sun in the pool of water from the many angles of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   view as the plane circles above, but you do see the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   reflection of the sun in the same pool with a visible- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   radiation video taken overhead. I have the whole FLIR 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   tape (not just the segments shown in McNulty's videos) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and have watched them extensively. I'll bet that there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is a reason they wanted these tests secret. Amazing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   how CNN is spinning this toward the favor of the FBI
