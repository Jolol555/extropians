Anyone ever hear of an invention by an Australian Physicist who invented a hand held &quot;rifle&quot; called Metal Storm?  This is/was an electo-static gun that pushed out (potentially) 100,000 fleshettes per minute. Kind of like  dozen Vulcan Mini-guns in a soldier's hand. Or is it just a quicker way to perform massacres in the Balkans or Rwanda or  California?

<EM>&gt; &gt; With the trend being to reduce &quot;collateral damage&quot; in military operations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and to adopt sub-lethal weapons in police operations (because of a growing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  sensitivity on the part of an informed public?), couldn't the end result be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the development of something with the equivalent effect of H.G.Wells' gas 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  peace in his film Things to Come? The mode of delivery pictured there would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  be impractical, but what about a subsubmunition resembling a swarm of gnats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  (with boring capabilities) delivering a sleeping gas by injection? To be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  followed by swift occupation and disarmament of the 'bad guys'. That's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  crude, but you get the idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously, I believe this is one underlying, genuine motivation (along with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profit and sheer geeky pursuit of cool tech) behind the development of these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of weapon systems.  Of course, super-smart weapons will also have the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential to serve as weapons of mass destruction, once self-replication 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrives on the scene.  Only time and a continuing effort for civil society to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control the military will tell which way they are used.
