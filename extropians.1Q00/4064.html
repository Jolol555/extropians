<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; I don't understand what you mean by your Omega point assumption. But how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about we start with a simple example, and then see where it needs to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complicated, eh?  Let's assume that in every possible state of the universe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you will eventually come to some &quot;end&quot; conclusion about ethics.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that provides me with the easiest way of explaining my Omega point
<BR>
claim.  If I reach an Omega point, I won't necessarily come to any &quot;end&quot;
<BR>
at all; I could have an infinite number of beliefs about ethics, each
<BR>
following from the previous set.
<BR>
<P>If I die, you may at least report my beliefs at death, but *without* some
<BR>
end of inquiry, it's hard to guess what your computation will report.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now consider the factual question of whether human's ancestral tribes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more like bonobo or baboon tribes.  You realize that this matters for human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethics.  Bonobo is the answer in sets A and C, while baboons are the answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in states B and D.
</EM><BR>
<P>How in heaven's name did you find out any of THAT?  You just all of a
<BR>
sudden &quot;realized&quot; not only that the fact-value distinction is bunk, but
<BR>
also that this particular fact can help settle the matter?  How could you
<BR>
establish this connection without begging the question against the
<BR>
fact-value distinction?  What empirical work would fix this point?
<BR>
<P>Again, there is some empirical component to ethics, and that element is
<BR>
fully computable.  If I'm worried about whether you committed a wrong
<BR>
yesterday, then finding out the empirical fact that you mugged a few
<BR>
innocents will help settle the question.  However, you have to do some
<BR>
ethical philosophy *before* facts like those become relevant.  In this
<BR>
case, you could determine that I believe that the bonobo/baboon question
<BR>
is ethically relevant and work from there.  (I don't, but suppose I did.)  
<BR>
But you're far away from establishing questions like deontology vs. virtue
<BR>
theory, utilitarianism vs. egoism, welfarism vs. objective good, etc. none
<BR>
of which have the empirical component, and without whose resolution it
<BR>
seems unlikely that you'll know very much about ethics.
<BR>
<P>Let's work with a particular S, namely, that deontology is a more accurate
<BR>
theory than virtue theory.  How would I realize that an empirical
<BR>
component would settle this question?  What sort of empirical facts would
<BR>
I want to know?
<BR>
<P>Is this simply a confusion of what sorts of questions ethics asks most of
<BR>
the time?
<BR>
<P>I'll grant that if this assumption which you stipulate could be
<BR>
established empirically, you'd be right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hopefully this has all been standard so far.  Now we do the think you seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to think is hard.  There are these same sets A,B,C,D with the same prior and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same relation to S, but we drop the bonobo/baboon interpretation of A,C
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs. B,D.   Now A,C are the sets where I just tell you that you will now have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 25% chance of agreeing with S, while B,D are the sets where I tell you its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 33% chance.  Upon hearing this you update your beliefs to be consistent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the claim I just made.  Ta da, I have fully taken into account the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect of my statement on you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Excuse me?  I had those priors for a reason (presumably) and having you
<BR>
tell me &quot;Your priors will be the following&quot; doesn't give me any reason, as
<BR>
such, for agreeing with you.  If I had somehow realized that bonobo thing,
<BR>
I'd buy this argument, but without that realization, I have no reason to
<BR>
update my priors to the ones you reccomend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand your objection.  It seemed well-posed and verifiable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me.  I you want to be clearer about verifiability, assume that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identity of the atom was encoded in a light beam sent off to another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; star, and the signal would return in ten years.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a very different case, IMO.  (Instead, BTW, I can just write down
<BR>
its location on a piece of paper and lock it in a safe.  Cheaper that
<BR>
way.)
<BR>
<P>In THAT case, we could imagine that if you knew enough about
<BR>
cognitive science, you could analyze the current physical state of my
<BR>
brain to determine my current beliefs about which atom I'd chosen,
<BR>
determine the mass of that atom, and report it.  All purely empirical.
<BR>
<P>However, my current beliefs are *not* fully determinable based on the
<BR>
current state of my brain.  If you had a perfect image of my brain stored
<BR>
on file, given however long you wanted to look at it, you wouldn't even be
<BR>
able to tell what my beliefs would be like in 20 years, say nothing of the
<BR>
end of inquiry.  My beliefs have been informed both by my own internal
<BR>
cogitations as well as things which happen TO me, things which you can't
<BR>
predict merely by looking at my brain.  So this analogy *definitely*
<BR>
doesn't carry over in this case.
<BR>
<P>Hal raised the point of ethical realism, but I don't think I need to stake
<BR>
out so strong a position to refute your argument.
