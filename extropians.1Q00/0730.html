<P><EM>&gt;I've been talking to the producer of the BBC television programme Heart of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Matter, and it now looks like they want to do a show on life-extension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(maybe touching on cloning as well).
</EM><BR>
<P>The BBC producer phoned today and we talked briefly, but I'll be speaking
<BR>
with him at length over the weekend.  The concept he wants to cover with me
<BR>
is a good one -- re &quot;virtues of research into superlongevity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If someone could write a few paragraphs about these things, that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most helpful. Other people, who are not expert in this area, can also help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by providing sound bites, quotes, interesting points or arguments, or any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other resource that can help. It has to be done immediately. I need to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it by tomorrow noon, so I can post a draft for feedback tomorrow evening.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A crucial consideration: we can't use anything dry. It has to make people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;sit up &amp; take notice&quot;, the producer said. So we want snappy, witty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fascinating stuff that takes us into the &quot;WOW this is it!&quot;-zone. If anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can deliver something on such short notice, I'd appreciate it very much.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that it would be best for you to review some Web sites and cut and
<BR>
paste ideas and quotes that enthuse you.  You don't want too much
<BR>
information memorized or you have to depend on because in an interview this
<BR>
can be very distracting.  Keep it simple and have a list of a *few* crucial
<BR>
points that you want to me.  You can use quotes, but don't get bogged down
<BR>
by them because it will distract from your own flow.
<BR>
<P>You can use anything from my book (which you now have in your competent
<BR>
hands) and think about why you want to live longer and why it is essential
<BR>
that society pay attention to the research that is occurring around us
<BR>
(have some facts about the *latest* research).  Use some key names such as
<BR>
Dr. Walford (CR), or Dr. White (head transplants) or new medicines such as
<BR>
nanomedicine (Robert Frietas) and genetic engineering (the DNA sequencing
<BR>
is happening very quickly now).  Bring up latest designs in prosthetics
<BR>
(new robotic limbs that athletes are using for participating in
<BR>
competitions (I don't know her name, but a female athlete has prosthetic
<BR>
legs and she is a superb runner).  Bring up names such as Stephen Hawkins
<BR>
whose brain is functional and creative regardless of his disease and how he
<BR>
communicates through technology, and also other individuals that are
<BR>
paralyzed but whose brains function very well (Christopher Reeves).  
<BR>
<P>If the interviewer tries to steer you in a direction that you think is not
<BR>
advantageous to the information you want to espouse, redirect the
<BR>
questions.  (I have this written in the Media Binder that you have).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, you will do beautifully Nick.  
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Natasha
