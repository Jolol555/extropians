<EM>&gt; &gt;This does not even touch on the issue of whether voting districts should
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;neutral to all these differences.  I believe they should be -- viz., that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the government should NOT legally recognize races, ethnics groups,
</EM><BR>
etc. --
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;though I do not here offer an alternative plan.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The obvious alternative plan is to completely *ignore* race.  The color of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your skin should have the same impact on your voting district (as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every other right, privilege, opportunity, etc.) as the color of your eyes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and hair.
</EM><BR>
<P>Didn't I write that above!?!  Reread it.  Let me retyped it:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I believe... that the government should NOT legally recognize races,
<BR>
ethnics groups, etc.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My saying I did not offer an alternative plan meant that I do not have a
<BR>
plan for districting.  What this means is, Yes, I'm against basing districts
<BR>
on race, ethnicity, and the like, but this does not tell me or anyone how to
<BR>
make districts.  Should they be based on what districts were in the past?
<BR>
Should they be random?  Should they be geographical?  Should people living
<BR>
in, say, Manhattan be placed in the same district with people in the Bronx?
<BR>
How should all this be decided?
<BR>
<P>Being against racial and ethnic voting discrimination does not magically
<BR>
conjure up a plan.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although I must admit that I'd be in favor of granting certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historically exploited peoples (native americans, slave descendants)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;reparations&quot; in the form of reduced (or even free) college tuition for
</EM><BR>
kids
<BR>
<EM>&gt; who academically qualify but cannot afford the tuition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be against this.  Native Americans should have as much land returned
<BR>
them as is possible and can be found to belong to them.  Slavery was over a
<BR>
long time.  Can't undo the past and there's no justification to tax people
<BR>
who had nothing to do with it -- such as, e.g., the descendants of Europeans
<BR>
who immigrated to the US after the Civil War.  (Not to mention, if you want
<BR>
to talk slavery, When will the Irish sue the English for reparations?  How
<BR>
about all those peoples the Soviets dominated for all those decades?  What
<BR>
about Mexicans and Cubans litigating against Spain?  Etc.)
<BR>
<P>Instead, I advocate rabid individualism and foaming at the mouth free
<BR>
markets to overcome all these problems.  (Of course, this won't overcome
<BR>
all, but it will do much better than wealth redistribution and new welfare
<BR>
programs.  Look, after all, at what the War on Poverty did for the people it
<BR>
was supposed to help.)
