<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; This neural firing representation of this information is nothing like
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; the original referents beyond our senses that initiated the perceptual
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; process,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only is the neural firing very different from the external thing that initiated
<BR>
it, the qualia the neurons produced is also very different.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;it simply abstractly &quot;models&quot; it.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is nothing simple about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Our brain takes this  abstract model of the information and produces
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;our conscious knowledge  of the original referent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Three problems:
<BR>
<P>1) I can't talk about &quot;our brain&quot; I'm the only one that's conscious for sure.
<BR>
2) You have it backward, neural firing is concrete, consciousness is abstract.
<BR>
3)I have no knowledge of the original referent except that it exists,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's not neural firing but it's not qualia either.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt; All that is required to sufficiently model color qualia is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; amount of information traveling through or being modeled by the neural
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; firing in the optic nerve,
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if you used the correct model for qualia there is no way you could
<BR>
know that it is correct.
<BR>
<P>Even if you knew it was correct there is no way to use it and know
<BR>
what it's like to be me. Reading that  my current mood was 19.6
<BR>
on the satisfaction scale, 6.4 on the fear scale and 9.26 on the anger
<BR>
scale would be interesting but you still wouldn't be me. If you really
<BR>
knew what it's like to be me then you'd be me and &quot;you&quot; would still
<BR>
be ignorant of my inner life.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Instead of simply assuming that *redness* is simply the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; behavior of reflecting light,
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody is saying that for goodness sake, I can produce redness
<BR>
in a completely dark room just by putting a little pressure on my eyeball.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; We've got to look for more than just abstract behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>Behavior is concrete, qualia is abstract.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;we've  got to discover what and why it is like what it is like.
</EM><BR>
<P>And what if qualia is not &quot;like&quot; anything at all except itself?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt; Taking the abstract information being modeled in one person's
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; optical nerve and feeding this into someone elses consciousness
</EM><BR>
<P>I can see how you'd feed the information into a person's brain but how
<BR>
do you feed it into a person's consciousness. and how do you know if
<BR>
you've done it right?
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;in  such a way that it produces the same phenomenal &quot;quale&quot; is &quot;effing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>But that's the problem. you will never know if it's the same phenomena.
