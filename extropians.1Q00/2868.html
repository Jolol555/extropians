<P>John, its one of those movies that came and went quietly in the theatres,
<BR>
then dittos in video, a tremendously underrated film.  I venture that
<BR>
few on this list ever heard of The Road to Wellville, or the excellent
<BR>
book
<BR>
on which it was based, same title, by T. Coraghessan Boyle.
<BR>
<P>This is a work of historical fiction, and it is clear that this author did
<BR>
<P>his homework thoroughly.  Wellville is about John Harvey Kellogg and
<BR>
the rise of the breakfast food industry.  Altho meticulously faithful to
<BR>
the facts, this brilliant writer manages to make the affair hilarious at
<BR>
the same time.  I have read three other of Boyles books, and they
<BR>
too are excellent.
<BR>
<P>[Wellville publisher Penguin Books, 1993]
<BR>
<P>The film starred Dana Carvey in his only (that I know of) sorta
<BR>
semi serious role.  Altho he does some hilarious stuff in there, it
<BR>
is the script and not SNL style cutting up.  Check it out! spike
