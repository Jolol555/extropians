<P><EM>&gt;&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there any reason, short of Mr Lorrey's hypothesized assault on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rationalism, not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refer to these other &quot;intelligences&quot; as what they *are*: abilities. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For the five-millionth time, yes. YES!! There IS a reason... drum roll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;please... and ..... The reason is, (yawn, getting tired of beating the poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dead horsey) that it is useful. It addresses teaching children who are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;normally classified as intelligent by the standards the old school
</EM><BR>
educators
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and pshycologists cling to. Research shows that when exposed to ideas
</EM><BR>
through
<BR>
<EM>&gt;different channels, students have shown remarkable aptitude for subjects
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;they previously did not do well in.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps there should be clarity between different concepts: 'intelligence',
<BR>
'learning', 'expression', 'abilities', etc. A person could be very
<BR>
intelligent, but need to learn in a particular way, otherwise they may seem
<BR>
to be 'dumb', because 'they don't get it', and are labelled as stupid. In
<BR>
fact, they may not get it because they need to get it a different way --
<BR>
which could be an aspect of their biology, conditioning or whatever: that's
<BR>
debatable.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there should be a distinction between interpretive/expressive
<BR>
processes (i.e. communicating with the rest of the world), and manipulative
<BR>
processes (i.e. internal arrangement
<BR>
and processing). This would help further understand the uniqueness of each
<BR>
person, and I could probably use the example of a computing machine has an
<BR>
internal capability of processing long deductive chains of information, but
<BR>
has a 1 bit interface to the world. You could argue that by standard
<BR>
external definition the that the machine is not intelligent. Hmm, sounds
<BR>
like Schrodinger's cat.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there should be a reevaluation of the attitudes of people, in the
<BR>
way that they connect the idea of 'person don't learn well' to 'person is
<BR>
not intelligent', which illustrates closed mindedness and a lack of
<BR>
understanding. For instance, sometimes artists want to do _their_ thing, and
<BR>
express in _their_ way, and people think they are stupid because 'they don't
<BR>
get it', when in fact, they do get it, but the just don't want to do it --
<BR>
for whatever reason.
<BR>
<P>There is always high regard for logical/spatial thinking; but it is not
<BR>
necessarily more &quot;important&quot; other abilities (perhaps an idea is to think of
<BR>
situations where the end of the world hinges on an indiviudals ability to
<BR>
interpret the emotions and feelings of a madman ... ?). The idea of
<BR>
logical/spatial intelligence being &quot;most important&quot; perhaps says more about
<BR>
your own view of the world (why is this particular reality so important over
<BR>
other realities, consider some other realities where logical/spatial
<BR>
intelligence leads to survival problems ...).
<BR>
<P>As a personal anecdote, I have in the last few years experienced an
<BR>
interesting form of bodily/kinesthetic intelligence. For instance, I am
<BR>
speaking and suddenly a memory enters my mind of another person (who I may
<BR>
or may not know) and a particular situation maybe several years in the past.
<BR>
I immediately realise that my facial muscles and expression correspond to
<BR>
this persons in that situation, so somehow my mind has the ability
<BR>
(&quot;intelligence&quot;?) to fit a lot of complex data together and pick out a
<BR>
memory. I would argue that this is similar to when I'm solving engineering
<BR>
problems, and my mind's eye has a picture of the spatial characteristics of
<BR>
the problem; and I'm able to relate those spatial characteristics to another
<BR>
conceptually similar problem ... a form of non-linear thinking
<BR>
(metaphorical/conceptual/etc). [I could describe my current experiments to
<BR>
learn about new ways of thinking: using my minds eye to see metaphors, fit
<BR>
biological/evolutionary models, dynamic models, and so on; and fit them
<BR>
across domains as well]
<BR>
<P>Another personal ancedote is emperical evidence of knowledge people that
<BR>
have multiple siblings, and finding out that one is very good at physics
<BR>
[complex problem solving], and the other has no maths capabilities, but is
<BR>
very good at arty photography [complex problem solving again .. do all the
<BR>
variables of light, tone, situation, emotion, ... etc solve a particular
<BR>
personal &quot;art&quot; desire?], and the other good project management. All of them
<BR>
seem to have a sort of high &quot;intelligence&quot;, but somehow directed in
<BR>
different ways.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;By the way, Binet is by no means the last (or latest) word on the subject,
</EM><BR>
he
<BR>
<EM>&gt;WAS a pioneer in 1905, but YEARS ago,  IQ testing did not withstand close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scrutiny, in fact this scrutiny has been helpful in creating many new tests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for intelligence including new ones for reasoning and cognitive abilities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Horses for courses, tests cover exactly what they were designed to test. IQ
<BR>
tests look at some narrow measure of ability, albeit important measure of
<BR>
ability for certain circumstances. Someone may score low on IQ, but in
<BR>
person
<BR>
be a great diplomatic negotiator and counsellor. If I were an employer, I'd
<BR>
use appropriate tests for apropriate circumstance.s
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;At least you studied it, and possibly Piaget, which at least gives your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answer SOME credibility. Piaget recognized that teaching needed to focus on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how children were reasoning rather than focusing on how well they might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recall facts for a test.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nevertheless, while his work is lauded by most researchers, it has had
</EM><BR>
little
<BR>
<EM>&gt;effect on the school system. Gardner's work has had great impact.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like a continuing trend of recognising that each person is
<BR>
individual:
<BR>
learns in different ways, acts in different ways, expresses in different
<BR>
ways,
<BR>
sublimates in different ways, needs different things.
<BR>
