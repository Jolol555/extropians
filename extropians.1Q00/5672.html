<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I've said before, privacy is a thing of the present, not of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure it will take quite some time for everyone to get on board, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; only way to real freedom is mutually assured surveillance.  Anonymity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; worthless to most law abiding citizens.  As fewer legal things become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;taboo&quot; anonymity will be completely worthless, except to criminals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; not Orwellian at all.  It's me watching you watching me watching Big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Brother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; watching us all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Big Borther, and all of your neighbors, are watching you....Now you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;really feel free now, right? &quot;Slavery is freedom.&quot; Yup thats 'real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;freedom' alright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well no.  No one is watching me now, at least not very closely (at least not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I'm aware of).  And of course, to the extent that I am being watched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right now, it does not give me any sense of freedom.  But the reason for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is that the &quot;watching&quot; is not *mutual*.  Mutuality is the key to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom in a transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you can watch me and I can (1) know the extent to which you are watching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me and (2) watch you to the exact same extent.  Yes, my friend, that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Its funny that people like you are the ones who say that Mutual Assured 
<BR>
Destruction is insane, when its the same exact principle. MAD assumes
<BR>
that 
<BR>
neither party can be trusted, and only the external threat of instant 
<BR>
annihilation is what keeps both parties in check. The MAD strategy
<BR>
relied 
<BR>
completely on the idea that both sides had to keep as total a level of 
<BR>
surveillance on the others activities as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Especially for law-abiding folks like myself.  See, when you live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your life with integrity, you have nothing to fear from people watching how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you live your life.  Especially when you know exactly *who* is watching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly *which* parts of your life and you can turn the microscope around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and watch them right back.  An additional benefit of transparency is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encourages people with less integrity (no I'm not pointing any fingers) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; act in more trustworthy ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Prisoners obey the law because they are in prison, not because it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;virtuous to do so. Treating everyone like a prisoner means the death of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;freedom, not 'real freedom'. Once nobody cares what is virtuous behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in themselves or others, what makes you think that they will care who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;watching them as they do anything they want to? At that point, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thing keeping the average person in a law abiding state is the threat of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;instant police action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prisoners obey the law for the same reason that everyone else does: they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't want to face the consequences of disobeying the law.  For people with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrity those consequences consist primarily of one's own nagging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscience.  For others the primary consequences include humiliation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss of money, liberty or life.  This will not change in a transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.  The only change will be the swift and sure imposition of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences (which after all is a *good* thing, particularly for those of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us who are law-abiding by nature).
</EM><BR>
<P>An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
<BR>
relies 
<BR>
only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing but 
<BR>
savages and have no honor or rights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But you miss the point, transparency is not about treating people as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prisoners.  It's about treating people as family (which when you think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is what they are).  I know almost everything about my wife.  Her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finances, her hopes, her fears, her weaknesses, her strengths.  I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly how she'll react if I kiss the backs of her knees.  I know where she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is almost all the time.  Does that make her my prisoner?  Especially when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1) she knows that I know these things about her and (2) she knows all these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same things about me?
</EM><BR>
<P>You have that relationship and you know those things about each other 
<BR>
because you both trust each other, not the other way around.
<BR>
<P>However, a true spousal relationship is based on the mutual trust that
<BR>
comes from 
<BR>
respect for the other, and the desire for respect from the other, such
<BR>
that you 
<BR>
could spend ten years apart from your spouse and they would trust that
<BR>
you
<BR>
would behave with respect toward them the entire time, even though they 
<BR>
have no idea what you are actually doing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You may not like it.  But no matter.  Transparency is the *only* solution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a society of superhumans.  When any given person has the potential to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set in motion things that could lead to the sterilization of the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet, you had better be able to trust (and keep a damn close eye on) your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighbors.  After all, if you could trust me, I mean *really* trust me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would you really mind so much if I knew everything about you?  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge would make me a much better companion for you and would make me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more fun for you to be around.
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing is, I trust myself more than I trust you, this is a given.
<BR>
However I do trust you
<BR>
&nbsp;to an extent based on your record and based on the fact that you come
<BR>
from a respectable 
<BR>
background. I know that *I* will not do those things, and because I
<BR>
beleive in the principle
<BR>
of equality, I find it safe to assume that you will behave the same way. 
<BR>
Because I want you trust me as much as you trust yourself, 
<BR>
I respect your right to your privacy. Surveillance indicates that trust
<BR>
does 
<BR>
not exist, and cannot exist. The sort of people who beleive that Mutual
<BR>
Assured
<BR>
Surveillance is the only option are the sort of people who beleive the
<BR>
whole
<BR>
fascist &quot;People are no damn good and need to be controlled&quot; routine.
<BR>
Total 
<BR>
sureveillance is the worst sort of tyranny, it does not matter one whit
<BR>
if
<BR>
its all mutual. Its the same thing with the socialist argument with
<BR>
property: 
<BR>
I don't trust anybody but myself to responsibly handly property, so
<BR>
therefore
<BR>
nobody has a right to property.
<BR>
<P>back to the trust issue, we make a contract between us, where we both
<BR>
claim we are
<BR>
honorable, trust-worthy, and have integrity. Only those that break that
<BR>
&nbsp;contract can be judged to have no honor or integrity, and therefore
<BR>
must 
<BR>
have total surveillance. THis is the presumption of innocence. A total 
<BR>
surveillance society throws out the presumption of innocence, because by 
<BR>
definition, the idea that all must be surveilled indicates that none 
<BR>
can be trusted, that none have honor or integrity. The only difference 
<BR>
between a Mutual Surveillance Society, and a Big Brother Fascist Society 
<BR>
is that in the fascist society some (those in charge) are either
<BR>
presumed 
<BR>
by themselves or everyone to have honor and/or integrity, and that
<BR>
nobody 
<BR>
else has any, while the Mutual Surveillance Society declares that no one 
<BR>
has integrity or honor.
<BR>
<P>Trust is based upon respect, not intimate knowledge. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who knows...if I knew everything about you, and you knew everything about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, and we could both trust the other implicitly, we'd probably become the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best of friends.  As it stands I think you are a reactionary gun &quot;nut&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you probably think I am a sanctimonious and narrow-minded fascist.  Surely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we can do better than that.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I would resent that you knew many private and embarrasing things
<BR>
about me
<BR>
that I would prefer that others did not know. You would know that this
<BR>
was a point
<BR>
of embarrassment and would use it with your primate hard wired instincts
<BR>
for the
<BR>
pecking order to humilitate and denigrate me in order to make yourself
<BR>
look better.
<BR>
<P>Resentment leads to hate. You do not build trust on a foundation of
<BR>
hate.

freedom nor security.&quot;
