I love how the Weekly World News seems to have the most fun stories!
<BR>
But this one was a classic.  I will share it with all my friends.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Disk capacity is an issue, however. Only a PC built after 1985 has &gt;the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;storage capacity to house an evil spirit, the minister explained.
</EM><BR>
This line killed me!  So I will be safe from harm if I use my precambrian 
<BR>
era Atari 800!
<BR>
<P>I remember Siskel and Ebert reviewing a film that came out in the early 
<BR>
eighties named, 'Evilspeak.'  It had this bullied cadet at a boy's military 
<BR>
school who found the 'Devil's chatroom' and signed an e.contract to have his 
<BR>
enemies killed off in return for his immortal soul.  This was done by demons 
<BR>
that resembled pigs which walked on their hindlegs!  Siskel and Ebert could 
<BR>
not say enough bad things about this film.  It must have been a stinker!
<BR>
<P>I have heard alot of stories of demonic influence and possession but never 
<BR>
anything about computers.  Perhaps 'old scratch' has so many human 
<BR>
'employees' pervading bad things on the net that he has no need for the 
<BR>
direct approach!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
