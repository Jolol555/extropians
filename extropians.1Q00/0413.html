Damien Broderick, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20SOC:%20Canadian%20poll%20on%20biotech%20issues&In-Reply-To=&lt;200001090607.WAA10774@finney.org&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</A>&gt;, writes, regarding
<BR>
the FX &quot;cancer cured&quot; claim:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; *Which* cancer? Some are *already* under control, some on the verge of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The general understanding of what goes wrong at a genetic level is now in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd expect some very high success-rate treatments by 2010 (or 2005), others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a bit later. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The actual wording at <A HREF="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Canc">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Canc</A>
<BR>
is:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer mortality in the United States will be reduced by 90%, relative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to 1994, in any year through 2010. (Mortality rates are determined
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by dividing the number of deaths by the population.) Cancer includes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leukemia, but excludes non-invasive solid tumors, and benign tumors. No
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjustments will be made for age-related risk, or for reduction or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in cancer-causing behavior or conditions, such as smoking,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air pollution, or ozone loss.
<BR>
<P>I think this is pretty well worded.  It tries to define what is cancer,
<BR>
and has an objective definition for a &quot;cure&quot;.  After all, what really
<BR>
matters with cancer is that it kills, and reduction in cancer mortality
<BR>
is the bottom line in any putative cancer cure.
<BR>
<P>The main problem is that it requires that a cure not only be found, but
<BR>
put into near-universal use in the US.  This would imply that the cure
<BR>
must be relatively inexpensive and not require a large capital outlay
<BR>
of machinery and equipment to be in place.  It also would probably be
<BR>
necessary that the cure be proven in the lab several years before the
<BR>
2010 cutoff so that it could be approved for human clinical use by 2010.
<BR>
Of course something as significant as a true cure for cancer would
<BR>
probably get expedited approval.
<BR>
