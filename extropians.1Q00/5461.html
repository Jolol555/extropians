wrote regarding Re: American Imperialism?:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact is that the Mexican government IS a very corrupt government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from top to bottom. Most governments have a for the most part honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization of public servants, where only the elected officials are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corrupt, and even then, typically those elected officials are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to be corrupted by those interests they already support. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mexican government is corrupt through its entire structure. Nobody who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lives in Mexico can deny this, because they likely have gotten the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shakedown for money from police, from government officials whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permits are needed, etc. The fact that the Mexican oil industry is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only oil producing nation that LOSES money on its oil operations ought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to tell you something.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it is true, and I've never denied it, and that's why I am pro oil
<BR>
privatization, however the government has done a great job in making
<BR>
us think, that if we make our oil industry private we'll loose 
<BR>
sovereignty
<BR>
and our economy will nosedive into poverty and misery.
<BR>
<P>Concerning corrupt police, it is precisely one of the aspects that 
<BR>
annoys
<BR>
me the most, the past week I was a victim of police and I had to give
<BR>
up 2 valuable possessions for me to be released. That's why although
<BR>
I've been silent in the gun debates, I think if guns were legalized 
<BR>
here
<BR>
in Mexico, police wouldn't abuse us as much as they do.
<BR>
<P>About foreign aid, it is our corrupt government who accepts it because
<BR>
we really shouldn't depend on foreign capital, we have the resources
<BR>
infrastructure and population to be autosuficient, however the 
<BR>
nation's
<BR>
riches are stolen by those in power and they have to ask for foreign
<BR>
aid to compensate, sometimes the foreign aid comes directly from the 
<BR>
u.s.
<BR>
To their pockets.
<BR>
<P>The moment we are able to get rid of all the scum that keeps deciding 
<BR>
what's best for us in a big brother approach, and brainwashing us 
<BR>
against
<BR>
libertarianism, wiser economic policies or privatization, we'll be 
<BR>
able
<BR>
to grow (hell we even do with all this)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Imperialism involves using force to get done what you want done, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locking other industrial powers out of the resources in the nations 
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have power over. Offering a country aid money in return for help in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fulfilling our own foreign policy needs is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but if the U.S. Government knows the foreign aids they send 
<BR>
benefits
<BR>
more corrupt politicians than us, and it just makes our dependence 
<BR>
greater
<BR>
why do they continue sending it? It appears to me they indirectly 
<BR>
support
<BR>
our corrupt government, why has never the U.S. Complained about the 
<BR>
tyranny
<BR>
we face and how they should help us in our advance to democracy.
