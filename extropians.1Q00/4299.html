Well, something would have to float at a sufficiently high orbit and have enough
<BR>
mass to stay there while acting as an elevator pulley anchor for things from the
<BR>
ground.  It would have to reinforce its place in orbit or gradually be pulled to
<BR>
a lower orbit by lifting things from the ground.  It should reach to ground at
<BR>
the highest feasible altitude, or even perhaps simply hang skyhooks into the
<BR>
stratosphere for ballons to be hooked.  Anyways, back to propulsion, it would
<BR>
need to have some form of reaction to offset lifting power.  I would suggest
<BR>
solar sails tacking against sunshine to do so.  Then, once something is lifted
<BR>
that high, if it needed to go into a higher orbit the required reaction mass
<BR>
would be much less by that point.
<BR>
<P>If something that bitg fell out of orbit, it would be bad for those where it
<BR>
landed, so among other things the cable would have to have some critical tensile
<BR>
strength and release upon any unbalancing mass.
<BR>
<P>Fun.

<EM>&gt; &gt;If a skyhook existed, one could climb sufficiently

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It was my impression that if one wanted a reasonably circular orbit, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only altitude one could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;jump into orbit from is the altitude of goesynchronous orbit. With any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lower altitude, you need a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lot more sideways velocity for a circular orbit then sitting at the top of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a tower that tall gives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I emailed Darin a little note, to wit:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Spike didn't say that the orbit was circular.   &lt;snip&gt;... the orbit is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elliptical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You're right, that a jump from a geosynchronous-orbit-tall tower will give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you a circular orbit.  &gt;In fact, all you have to do is raise your feet off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the platform, cause, hey, you and the platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are already in orbit.  No jumping to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Then spike replied (to Darin, not to me):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That's a good question, one that I want to work on. If one went up about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an earth diameter on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cable and let go, what would be the shape of that orbit? Also, I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sharpened my calcs a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and found that the whole question of climbing a cable and letting go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get into a minimal orbit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;might be wrong: I found a flaw in my reasoning today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I puzzled over it for a week, and found no flaw in spike's reasoning,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or, to be more precise, no flaw in his conclusion.  Quite elegant, actually.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to Kepler and Newton all planetary orbits are elliptical (a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circle being a special case of an ellipse), with the center of the orbited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet located at one of the foci.  If one is considering orbits around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earth, then the earth is at one focus.  If one then imagines an earth-sized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sphere adjacent to the earth, its center defines a second focus, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; furthest out point on the earth-sized sphere--the point diametrically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opposite the point of contact between the earth-sized sphere and the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earth--can be chosen to define one point--the extreme end--of an ellipse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then, by symmetry the other end of the ellipse just grazes the atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the far side of the real earth.  Now, by Newton and Kepler, this ellipse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a valid earth orbit, and the condition of it grazing the atmosphere of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the real earth makes it the minimum viable orbit for the condition of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; climbing the tower and just letting go.  Thus, one comes up with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earth-diameter high tower that spike derived.  Stepping off the tower at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that height corresponds to entering the orbit at the apogee. Just grazing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the earth at the other end is the perigee.  Nifty.
</EM><BR>
