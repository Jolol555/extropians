<EM>&gt; &gt; My intent is not to resurrect an old and contentious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thread...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But you have done just that -- i.e., resurrect a thread.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>But this was certainly an unintended consequence; it never occurred
<BR>
to me that someone might disagree with my proposition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The key to proper differentiation is, in my opinion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the concept of &quot;doubt&quot; and the &quot;doubtable&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree in this specific case.  I define &quot;theist&quot; as &quot;one who believes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a God or gods&quot; and &quot;atheist&quot; as &quot;one who is not a theist&quot; -- the latter does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not have such beliefs.
</EM><BR>
<P>For any such positions to be significant, the individual must intentionally
<BR>
ascribe these predicates to him/herself. For me to attribute atheism to
<BR>
a polynesian who affirmed the efficacy of &quot;mana&quot; but was ignorant of any
<BR>
personified gods or goddesses would be ridiculous. To be either a &quot;theist&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;atheist&quot; one must understand these concepts and make a knowledgeable
<BR>
judgment about which, as far as s/he is concerned, correctly describes
<BR>
reality as they understand it.  As ridiculous as ascribing &quot;atheism&quot; to an
<BR>
infant.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; This is a pure belief view of both.  By these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitions, no epistemology or argument is implied.  One could be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atheist merely because one was never taught about religion.  Or one could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an atheist because one blindly follows on this issue another person who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an atheist.  The same could be said of the theist.
</EM><BR>
<P>As, in the above paragraph, I strongly disagree that one can be an unconscious
<BR>
atheist, because one cannot take any responsibility for this position. The same
<BR>
is true of the mindless compulsion to follow a leader, whether the ideology is
<BR>
atheism or theism. A voluntary and informed consent is required.
<BR>
<P>The entire discussion presupposes the persons have at least reached the
<BR>
Age of Reason with sufficient self-understanding to assess a statement
<BR>
such as &quot;There is a superior power that created you and the universe and
<BR>
who knows everything about you at all times and who has decided what
<BR>
action you are to take in every situation; denying that you are his subject
<BR>
ignoring his plan for you and deliberately violating his laws will result in
<BR>
severe punishment. There is nothing you can do to free yourself from this
<BR>
situation.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Regarding any proposition that must be either &quot;true&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or &quot;false&quot;, or any two positions one of which may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; true but both of which cannot be &quot;true&quot;, then if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;willingly suspends belief&quot; in either and postpones a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; logical judgment one may be called a SKEPTIC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If, on the contrary, one affirms that either but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; both is true (i.e. one is true and one is false)then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one may be called a DOGMATIST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem here is Robert is using terms which connote certain things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Generally, a dogmatist is not one who believes such proposition because she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has to choose, BUT rather one who believes without proper  validation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's the conventional way the term is used.  As such, the term has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain connotation -- i.e., that the dogmatist is irrational or, even when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she is right, she's probably right for the wrong reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I use the word &quot;dogmatist&quot; no pejorative connotation is implied; to
<BR>
me it simply means those who affirm the truth of a proposition in the
<BR>
absence of any compelling factual justification, generally accompanied by
<BR>
some appeal to authority. There is no possible way of inductively or
<BR>
deductively proving the universal non-existence of something, and so far
<BR>
no convincing evidence of the existence of a Supreme Being  external to,
<BR>
and/or participative in, the Universe having the properties of  Necessary
<BR>
and Infinite Being, Omniscience, Omnipotence, the ability to create ex
<BR>
nihilo, and upon which the existence of all finite things depends.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The usual reason in this area -- theism vs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atheism -- is some claim there's not enough evidence to decide.  But that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remains to be proven, because I would claim there IS enough evidence to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide in favor of atheism -- that is, atheism is defensible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  The suspension of judgment occurs when the evidence does not
<BR>
permit the verification of an assertion of the existence or the non-existence
<BR>
of something. To say that both options are &quot;doubtful' simply means to me
<BR>
that a basic uncertainty attaches to both which in one case it is impossible
<BR>
to resolve, and in the other some supernatural event to resolve.
<BR>
<P>I must simply deny the truth of your statement that &quot;there IS enough evi-
<BR>
dence to decide in favor of atheism.&quot;  Not because I am a theist (in fact,
<BR>
my persuasion is skeptical) but on purely logical grounds. To define the
<BR>
term &quot;agnostic&quot; to emphasis my point:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Agnosticism is the thesis that, contrary to what atheists and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theists alike assume, it is either in practice or in principle im-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible to know whether or not God exists.
<BR>
<P>Thus I prefer the word &quot;skeptic&quot; to preserve the distinction between &quot;the
<BR>
unknown&quot; and &quot;the unknowable&quot;. &quot;Agnostic&quot; literally means the negation
<BR>
(&quot;a&quot;) of knowing (&quot;gnosis&quot;) (c.f. &quot;gnosticism).  To a classical Hellene, this
<BR>
word meant &quot;of whatever gods there may be, nothing whatever can be
<BR>
known.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just that therea re two possibilities does not reduce one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to skepticism.  There always must be a basis for doubt.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is such a basis with respect to two propositions which are contra-
<BR>
dictories; one  must be true but both cannot be true. Either there is a
<BR>
God or there isn't. When I say &quot;I doubt both propositions&quot; I mean I cannot
<BR>
logically or empirically decide between them.  The lexical meaning of &quot;doubt&quot;
<BR>
is simply &quot;uncertainty&quot; and &quot;questionability&quot; and this is what I mean. So --
<BR>
when confronted with a declarative sentence, if its truth is to me uncertain
<BR>
or questionable then I &quot;doubt&quot; it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In this sense, the meaning of &quot;Agnostic&quot; is softened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from asserting that the logical status of a proposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is undecidable, to one that implies withholding judg-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ment given the current state of knowledge. And,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pari passu, propositions advanced by BOTH the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Atheist&quot; and &quot;Theist&quot; must be classified as &quot;Dogmatic&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But by Robert's defintion, that I claim to exist and be conscious now makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me a dogmatist.:) [1] That Robert claims his view is correct regarding this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; classification -- i.e., that his meaning of agnostic is coherent and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the contrary view that it is not is not true -- makes him a dogmatist.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms become nearly useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is the passage concerning &quot;Agnostic&quot; in my original post&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, the meaning of &quot;Agnostic&quot; is softened
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to one that implies withholding judgment given the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current state of knowledge. And, pari passu, proposi-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tions advanced by BOTH the &quot;Atheist&quot; and &quot;Theist&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be classified as &quot;Dogmatic&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I see nothing vague here: I am merely suggesting that &quot;Skeptic&quot;
<BR>
is a more conciliatory word than &quot;Agnostic&quot; -- As a skeptic,
<BR>
I am willing to be convinced by evidence either way. I do not
<BR>
regard the existence of some extraordinary cosmic Being as out
<BR>
of the question -- I as a skeptic don't know, whereas both the
<BR>
&quot;atheist&quot; and the &quot;theist&quot; DO know, BUT ON INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS.
<BR>
<P>Please note, Daniel, that I am deleting your following discuss-
<BR>
ion for the sake of space, but of course we can address those
<BR>
points as well. Your subsequent thoughts are quite interesting
<BR>
to me, as is this topic.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
<P>Bob
<BR>
<P><P>P.S. Descartes actually began his &quot;Meditations&quot; with &quot;Dubito
<BR>
ergo sum&quot; but later changed it to &quot;Cogito&quot;.  Interesting.
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
[1] Indeed it does -- the only &quot;proof&quot; you offer is an appeal to your
<BR>
own authority. There is at least one person on this list would deny
<BR>
your claim of &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;personal identity&quot;.
