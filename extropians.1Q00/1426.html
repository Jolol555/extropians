<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;it's obvious to me that I'm saying I have no way to gather 
</EM><BR>
enough data to read beyond it.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>I had originally pre replied to this but took it out because I 
<BR>
felt it complicated the matter too much for this particular 
<BR>
exercise.  So here it is again for the first time.
<BR>
<P>Even if one feels there is no more data and they're stuck 
<BR>
using what they've got, and is not enough for a conclusion, 
<BR>
they should still &quot;make-up&quot; imaginary data with properties 
<BR>
consistent with that of the original data. bla bla bla, I 
<BR>
think you can see where I'm going with this. So in 
<BR>
conclusion because you still don't try to think further than 
<BR>
the data you don't think for yourself on issues like this.
<BR>
<P>But then again not making a decision is still a decision, so 
<BR>
in a way this is thinking for yourself. Hmm. Didn't think of 
<BR>
this before.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;The sheaf of hypotheses lumped and labeled &quot;(G/g)od(s)&quot; is 
</EM><BR>
too broad for me to meaningfully disprove. Popper and
<BR>
all, you know.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>It should be easy. The broadest definition I can think of is 
<BR>
&quot;the creator of all things.&quot; I can easily say it's hogwash 
<BR>
because then &quot;what created it?&quot;, ad infinity. If it created 
<BR>
itself (note: a very very complex entity) then what about 
<BR>
the smallest particles creating themselves? After all the 
<BR>
smallest particle is much simpler than the god. So if 
<BR>
anything created itself (appeared out of nowhere) by occam's 
<BR>
razor the particle created itself. The particle couldn't 
<BR>
make up god because god is the &quot;creator of all things.&quot; So, 
<BR>
in a poof of logic god disappears.
