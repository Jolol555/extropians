<EM>&gt; &gt; Especially in an age where integrity, honesty, honor, and loyalty all

<EM>&gt; &gt; situations rather than giving in to the barbarians. I would be John

<EM>&gt; &gt; Galt, rather than to aid others without recompense.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; John Galt didn't seek a government-granted monopoly on his engine;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he locked it in a room and sold the power it generated like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalist, no patents needed.  Too bad he didn't realize how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more fabulously wealthy the gulch would have been (including him)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if he had also allowed others to build the engines and find new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications for them and improve them.
</EM><BR>
<P>If he had allowed the others (all those people living in their People's
<BR>
Republics) to build the engines, they would never have paid him for them,
<BR>
claiming it was his duty to serve society and that satisfaction that so many
<BR>
people were happy was enough reward for him. Bah.
