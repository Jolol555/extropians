&nbsp;Huh ?  I think that from selfishness you get self-respect, and an urge to 
<BR>
&nbsp;improve yourself and to embrace 'Dynamic Optimism'.  I am a thoroughly 
<BR>
selfish 
<BR>
&nbsp;person -- which makes me want to improv &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;I'm aiming at becoming an evil, destructive, *intelligent* and selfish 
<BR>
&nbsp;creature :-):-):-). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>I think the term selfish is annoying, used in replacement for &quot;self-love&quot;, or 
<BR>
&quot;self-esteem&quot;, it alienates and irritates others. It is a &quot;bad-boy&quot; lingo, 
<BR>
spawned by the baddest boy of all, Ayn Rand, who became a bit addled later in 
<BR>
life fancied herself a man. It is bear-bating.
<BR>
<P>I far prefer the softer touch, being not interested in being a boy, bad or 
<BR>
good.
<BR>
I prefer nurturing, two way winning, joy giving ways. I don't share a lack of 
<BR>
love for others.... In fact I often desire to be of use to them : ) -- of 
<BR>
&quot;service&quot;. It pleases me : )
<BR>
<P>Most often I use Natasha Vita More's term &quot;Automorph&quot;  to describe the 
<BR>
concept of taking control of one's own destiny.
<BR>
<P>Even &quot;self-love&quot; distrubs some people:  puritan, self effacing ethics die 
<BR>
hard.
<BR>
<P>I dislike adding a negative connotation to a good idea.
<BR>
<P>I also like to reflect on the way I come across, in order to be more 
<BR>
effective in promoting my own ideology. I avoid bating people. Courtesy gives 
<BR>
better results. That means thinking of others.
<BR>
<P>Get real:  &quot;Selfish&quot; in common tongue of today, means only one thing. Caring 
<BR>
only for your own good at the expense of others. It is held as repugnant and 
<BR>
will continue to be so, not matter how many objectivists moan and wail of 
<BR>
it's use
<BR>
Get over it: 
<BR>
<P>It's not the ONLY meaning, however is the definition that most people agree 
<BR>
upon. If you go around calling yourself that, you are deliberately provoking 
<BR>
ill will. Why?
