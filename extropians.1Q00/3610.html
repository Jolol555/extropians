<EM>&gt;( To my pretty bold statement that software engineers describe intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in terms of software capabilities.)
</EM><BR>
&lt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  This was likely true, but if you look at what is going on currently in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the congitive sciences and reinforcement learning community, people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are definitely getting interested in emotions as essential part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thank you. It seems so obvious to an artist that they are essential to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought, for my job is to bring out of my intelligence, the emotive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I require, onto an image, into the visual arena,  where it can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processesd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by the cortex (eyes) into the brain in an entirely non-verbal way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But is humor actually an emotion? Of the same type as sadness, for example?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is it not, rather a sensibility?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are sensibilities and emotions really the same thing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is there a correcation between happiness and homor?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Psychologically, humor is sported often JUST when people are enduring pain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and sadness, sort of as a survival technique.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If humor is an emotion, then are other sensibilities, such as talent, taste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and aptitude emotions too?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;From my rather lay-woman's point of view, the only emotion that science 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have researched exhaustively are anxiety and chronic sadness 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(depression)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;, in order to cure it. Aern't the more &quot; acceptable&quot; ones, like happiness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bliss, boredom, rejection, satisfaction, caring, enthusiasm, love,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trepidation, curiousity, hope, greed, pity, gratefulness, uncertainty, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etc. etc. etc, are still really un-understood.&lt;end quote&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Nathaniel Branden, in applying Ayn Rand's philosophical principles 
<BR>
to the study of consciousness, made at least a really fine start in his 
<BR>
original &quot;The Psychology of Self Esteem.&quot;  Arthur Koestler also did some 
<BR>
really nice analysis of various aspects of the non-digital sides of 
<BR>
consciousness in such works as his &quot;The Act of Creation, in which he does 
<BR>
define and validate a full explanation of humor, among other things.  
<BR>
&quot;Non-digital,&quot; by the way, does not mean &quot;non-rational.&quot;  It's just that 
<BR>
consciousness is fundamentally different in structure from any computational 
<BR>
device out there, including so-called neural nets, altho they are a step 
<BR>
closer.
