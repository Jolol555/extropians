<P><EM>&gt; One project is to convince one relatively rich economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  somewhere to completely open its borders to immigration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  even setting up a loan program to pay for transportation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  costs.  This might do more for the world's poor than most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anything I can imagine.  And that one country could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  benefit immensely.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I think this a great idea, I think it falls into the &quot;fat chance!&quot; 
<BR>
category.  Consider the constant battle required to ever so slowly inch 
<BR>
forward the cause of free trade in goods and services.  With similar constant 
<BR>
effort, we may see the development of zones of more free immigration, such as 
<BR>
in the EU (albeit there at a high cost of buying into the EU paradigm of 
<BR>
monolithic, centralized economic regulation).  Until Mexico achieves a more 
<BR>
robust and open civil society, we're unlikely to see NAFTA go that way to any 
<BR>
significant extent.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Yet another project is to explore the vast untouched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  space of possible forms of government.  Because democracy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  seems better than monarchy, people seem to have concluded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that current forms of democracy are the best there is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In fact, we have barely dipped our toe into the ocean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of possible forms of government.  (For an example of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a very different possible form, as me about &quot;futarchy.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>OK - I'll bite: Tell me about &quot;futarchy&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Regarding specific technological innovations, I think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  best way to promote them is two offer large prizes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  specific achievements.  I would like to see much larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prizes offered for progress toward nanotech assemblers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and for progress toward uploading of humans into computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>As others have pointed out recently, technology prizes HAVE seemed to spur 
<BR>
innovation in the past.  I'd like to see a real economic analysis and 
<BR>
rigorous historical study of the example with which I'm most familiar, the 
<BR>
aviation prizes in the 1920s and 30s.  It would be interesting to see an 
<BR>
in-depth look to see how things like the Bendix and Scheider Trophies 
<BR>
actually worked to spur innovation.  Was it the money?  The fame?  Some of 
<BR>
both? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  The big projects I think of as a waste are most space,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  medicine, and education, and parenting projects.  These last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  three are feel good projects, but the sad truth is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  medicine, education, and parenting don't actually do very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  much useful on the margin; we could cut way back on these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  without much harm.  Space projects now also seem a waste to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  me; until costs are low enough to allow economies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  flourish in space, it's just money down the drain.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've read your analysis of the low marginal effect of spending on medicine 
<BR>
before and can only conclude that my economic illiteracy disables me from 
<BR>
appreciating the force of your conclusions.  Perhaps on a gross societal 
<BR>
level spending on medicine has little marginal effect, but I know that I'd be 
<BR>
close to a cripple today without recent advances in orthopedic surgical 
<BR>
techniques.  This has a high value to ME
<BR>
<P>As for current spending on space exploration and development, I reluctantly 
<BR>
agree that it is hard to justify specific expenditures in light of the 
<BR>
substantial improvements in capabilities that technology just a couple of 
<BR>
decades off (at most) promises.  But over-all amounts spent on space 
<BR>
technology and exploration are relatively low on a societal scale, and at a 
<BR>
certain level, don't you think people should do things just because it's 
<BR>
COOL?  To me, money spent on space exploration now is really more akin to 
<BR>
spending on the arts: How does an economist justify what we spend on symphony 
<BR>
orchestras or rap music CDs, for that matter?
