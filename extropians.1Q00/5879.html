Oh sure, that's likely to go over *really* well. &quot;Hey, lets all fund a bunch 
<BR>
of way-out research so Bill Gates can live forever, while millions of kids 
<BR>
in the third world (not to mention a few thousand right in the good old U S 
<BR>
of A) go to bed hungry every night.&quot; Nobody's going to touch that with a 10 
<BR>
foot pole.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>This is a popular way of thinking but for the reasons listed by the posters 
<BR>
I quote below, I just don't see it working out this way.  And if Bill Gates 
<BR>
wanted to really live forever HE could fund the research to the tunes of 
<BR>
billions if he wanted to!!  Tax payer dollars would not be needed! lol  And 
<BR>
we have already discussed on the list how so much of foreign aid is sadly 
<BR>
misdirected in a program that is flawed from the start.

I don't think there's any such problem. We spend billions on research for 
<BR>
diseases like Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, and prostate cancer, where the 
<BR>
result will only benefit old people in rich countries. Much less gets spent 
<BR>
on research for 3rd world food production. I don't see why attitudes would 
<BR>
be substantially different about longevity research, a new way of 
<BR>
benefitting old people in rich countries.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Exactly!  But using terms like, 'longevity research' makes it acceptable to 
<BR>
most and not as politically explosive as words like &quot;immortality research&quot; 
<BR>
which in my view should be avoided.  I wonder just how much is spent on 
<BR>
researching improved ways for the third world to produce food?  What real 
<BR>
gains have been made?

In that the pools of money originally referred to was in part from &quot;(1) the 
<BR>
estimated fifteen trillion dollars that baby boomers stand to inherit from 
<BR>
the World War II generation,&quot; the baby boomers are most definitely 
<BR>
interested and involved in basic areas life extension. Cosmetic surgery, 
<BR>
fitness routines and lean figures may seem very mundane, but multi-track and 
<BR>
see these boomers a decade up the road and they will be lined up for 
<BR>
cryonics, and then a few more decades up the road and they may be lined up 
<BR>
to have their brains uploaded.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Natasha, you hit the nail on the head here!  The baby boomers generation is 
<BR>
most likely going to fight aging (youthful appearance loss and loss of 
<BR>
function) screaming and kicking all the way!  This generation is used to 
<BR>
prosperity and getting their way and will raise hell in Washington a decade 
<BR>
or so from now if they feel barriers are being put in the way of longevity 
<BR>
research.  They are beginning to just now really sense their impending 
<BR>
mortality.
<BR>
<P>I would like to think that many of them will line up for cryonics but I am 
<BR>
not so certain.  But as vitrification is perfected I could see that 
<BR>
happening.  We need a better product and not just good marketing and 
<BR>
advertising. lol
<BR>
<P>One thing to keep in mind is that as they face mortality many boomers may 
<BR>
have a 'knee-jerk' reaction and take up a much more conservative stance on 
<BR>
things, a throw-back to their parents.  This might cause many to view aging 
<BR>
and death as part of the natural cycle of things and to even actively oppose 
<BR>
the longevity research we desire.  Time will tell.  Natasha, I hope you are 
<BR>
right and that my fears turn out to be groundless.
<BR>
