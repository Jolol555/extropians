'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;It seems that even if your system works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;flawlessly, the result is simple total surveilance a la Brin, where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cameras are everywhere and anyone who wants to can look at any camera at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any time to find out what you're up to right now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep, that's pretty much the idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>I only mentioned it to show that I had a very clear idea of what you were
<BR>
referring to, after all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I never said it would be a &quot;simple system.&quot;  It will likely take the help of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strong AI and nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see.  Allow me to refine my argument then.
<BR>
<P>You seem to agree with me that a Whole Lot of Data Crunching would be
<BR>
necessary to make this system viable.  Now, clearly, if I have access to a
<BR>
data-cruncher and you don't, even if we both have access to all the
<BR>
cameras, I'm getting a lot more use out of the system than you are.
<BR>
Indeed, without a data-cruncher, the system is almost useless to you in
<BR>
comparison to its utility to me.  This point can be generalized: if I can
<BR>
crunch data better than you can, then I'll get more use out of the system
<BR>
than you can.
<BR>
<P>But let's recall how this point came up in the first place.  The assertion
<BR>
was that this system would be more useful to someone with more power than
<BR>
it would to someone with less power.  The reason given was because the
<BR>
people with more power would be able to crunch data better, and thereby
<BR>
get more use out of the system.  You countered that people wouldn't have
<BR>
to crunch the data at all.  But, clearly, SOMEONE has to crunch the data.
<BR>
If you'd have it that a strong AI would do the work, fine, but strong AIs
<BR>
require fast processors as their substrate.  Whoever owns the processors
<BR>
owns the results which this AI would put out.  This someone will be the
<BR>
powerful, and not the weak.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In a truly transparent society there would be no &quot;despots&quot; unless we the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people collectively decided to turn our fates over to a despot.  I don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know about you, but I ain't voting for any despots anytime soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;But I am your king!&quot;  &quot;Well, I didn't vote for you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Look, I'm trying to be civil here, but I can't make any sense of this
<BR>
claim.  How the hell do you think despots get to power, anyway?  By
<BR>
popular vote?  They sure as hell don't go around knocking on doors and
<BR>
kissing babies and asking for your support.  Instead, they kick someone's
<BR>
ass, and then make the plausible claim that they'll kick the ass of anyone
<BR>
who tries to harm them.  Nobody &quot;turns their fates over to a despot.&quot;
<BR>
They simply don't rise up, out of fear that they'll be squashed like a bug
<BR>
if they do.
<BR>
<P>Despotism doesn't, at any step of the picture, rely on secrecy in any way
<BR>
whatsoever.  On the contrary, perfect transparency is in the despot's best
<BR>
interests.  That way you can be quite confident that when the despot
<BR>
claims that he'll squash you like a bug, he *really will* squash you like
<BR>
a bug.  Knowing that someone is a despot does not help you get rid of the
<BR>
despot in any way whatsoever.
