<P><EM> &gt; All of the Mycobacteria and probably some of the ultra-micro bacteria
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; strains are probably adaptable.  The &quot;control&quot; problem is easy to solve
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; since you can engineer in suicide triggers.  I think the advantage to
</EM><BR>
<P>The things autoreplicate within the cell, imposing their metabolic
<BR>
load. Controlling the bacteria population within the cell without
<BR>
killing the cell is imo very nontrivial.  This is very different from
<BR>
having a dormant set of genes waiting to be switched on.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; bacteria is that you can really &quot;engineer&quot; them to be high production
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; factories.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You don't need a lot of antifreeze protein to do its magic.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; 1) Immunoreaction takes time to gear to full response
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You are going to get some inflamation as soon as the proteins get
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; displayed in the MHC complexes, that should only be a matter of
</EM><BR>
<P>Ideally, the proteins stay within the CNS's cells.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; hours after you turn on the protein production.  I agree a large
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; reaction would take immune system amplification and that would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; take days to weeks.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Now how long you have to worry about this depends on how fast you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can produce sufficient protein concentration to allow the next stage
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the cool down.  You can't cool down too much while you are still
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; producing the protein because you reduce protein production.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. You nuke the immune system, get in your vectors, wait for
<BR>
tranfecttion to complete, then give your signal intravenously,
<BR>
incubate for a day or two, then start the suspension.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 2) Immunoreaction can be supressed (and, with a typical patient, is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;    not in the best shape anyway)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; This seems to be a good solution for cryonics but a bad solution for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; long-term gene &quot;enhancements&quot;.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I don't think nontrivial (going beyond simple metabolism patches) gene
<BR>
enhancements (once we will be able to do them safely) will be relevant
<BR>
on the time scale in question. Provided, Singularity is not a figment,
<BR>
of course.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; We're talking about the end of your biological life span, something
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; taking few days or weeks at best. The problem is having a quantitative
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; tranfection vector targeting neural tissue without destroying it.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The real trick is &quot;quantitative&quot;, one of the reasons the cryoprotectant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fluids are so viscous is because the concentrations are so high.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is impossible to load the system with polyols of sufficient
<BR>
concentration from within. Near-terminally damaged CNS insect larvae
<BR>
are not. Noncolligative cryoprotectants do not have a measurable
<BR>
impact on viscosity. Clearly, you still need a hybrid approach,
<BR>
loading the tissue externally with enough glass formers sufficient to
<BR>
vitrify a macroscopic organ.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; What you would like is a low concentration fluid that &quot;sticks&quot; once
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; inside.  Then you could pump it in at low concentrations but it would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; get selectively concentrated to higher and higher levels in the cells.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
An antifreeze protein doesn't have a native pumping system (unless we
<BR>
engineer it in), so it would tend to stay in cell lumen. Which is imo
<BR>
good.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; This is the same problem we face in &quot;reversing&quot; aging in adults
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and is something I've devoted a lot of thought to.  Biobots with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; supplemental genomes are I think the way to go until nanobots become
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; feasible.  Cryoprotectant manufacturing vehicles would be an interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; application because you don't have the normal approval headaches
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; since the person is technically &quot;dead&quot;.  However, this isn't exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a &quot;booming&quot; market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely. Also, there are ways to load the brain more efficiently by
<BR>
using blood-brain barrier perforation. This may involve getting in
<BR>
goodish quantities of polymers, including biopolymers.
