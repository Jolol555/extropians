<BR>
However calling any and every capability of the mind an 'intelligence' is PC 
<BR>
doublespeak.  There is no reason the original words to describe those 
<BR>
capabilities should not be used. The campaign in the political world is 
<BR>
being waged by the luddites and new agers to dilute and eliminate the 
<BR>
importance of analytical and logical intelligence in modern society. Don't 
<BR>
get sucked into the trap.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>he also wrote:
<BR>
PC as in politically correct.  Intelligence is merely one group of processes 
<BR>
that must be developed.  The 'emotion','creativity','social ability', and 
<BR>
other abilities of the human mind are other processes. They are not 
<BR>
intelligences,they are abilities.  We could go in the other direction and 
<BR>
say that everything the human mind does is an emotion.  Logical thinking is 
<BR>
an emotion, creativethinking is an emotion, social ability is an emotion, 
<BR>
etc. ad nauseum.  The reason the current social scientists are trying to 
<BR>
call every human mental ability an 'intelligence' is because real 
<BR>
intelligence is the most respected human ability, and they are trying to 
<BR>
make every other ability be perceived as being of equal value.  Its pure 
<BR>
politically correct poppycock.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I am not sure if my original post on this subject was sent or not and so I 
<BR>
will post again but make it shorter.  Mike Lorrey castigated the idea of 
<BR>
&quot;multiple intelligences&quot; which I consider to be a very reputable theory.  I 
<BR>
would ask everyone to check out the website by Howard Gardner, A Harvard 
<BR>
trained neuropsychologist who wrote the book &quot;Multiple Intelligences.&quot;
<BR>
<P>His website explanations are brief and to the point so you don't need alot 
<BR>
of time to get an understanding of his proposals.  It is well worth the time 
<BR>
to peruse the site.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://edweb.cnidr.org/edref.mi.hist.html">http://edweb.cnidr.org/edref.mi.hist.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Gardner explains that there is far more to the human intellect then the 
<BR>
logical/analytical part which is of course, is very important but not 
<BR>
everything.
<BR>
<P>These are the forms of intelligence that he recognizes, (from his website)
<BR>
<P>Musical Intelligence
<BR>
Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence
<BR>
Logical-Mathematical Intelligence
<BR>
Linguistic Intelligence
<BR>
Spatial Intelligence
<BR>
Interpersonal Intelligence
<BR>
Intrapersonal Intelligence
<BR>
<P>Gardner has never ruled out the possibility that additional intelligences 
<BR>
may also exist, for MI research is still in its infancy.  Recently, he added 
<BR>
an eighth intelligence to the list: the Naturalist Intelligence.  There's 
<BR>
also been some consideration of a ninth intelligence - existential 
<BR>
intelligence - but the jury is still out on that one. Besides, for now at 
<BR>
least, a great deal of new understanding may be found from within these 
<BR>
eight faculties.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Gardner continues...
<BR>
Regarding the conventional theory of intelligence, Gardner wrote:
<BR>
WHEN ONE IS ASKED to consider the question &quot;What makes a person 
<BR>
intelligent?,&quot; the most common responses will often note a person's ability 
<BR>
to solve problems, utilize logic, and think critically.  These typical 
<BR>
traits of intelligence are sometimes lumped together under the lable of &quot;raw 
<BR>
intelligence.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A person's intelligence, traditionally speaking, is contained in his or her 
<BR>
general intellect - in otherwords, how each and every one of us comprehend, 
<BR>
examine, and respond to outside stimuli, whether it be to solve a math 
<BR>
problem correctly or to anticipate an opponent's next move in a game of 
<BR>
tennis.  Our intelligence, therefore, is our singular, collective ability to 
<BR>
act and react in an ever-changing world.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>I look forward to further discussion on this topic.
