<P><EM>    &gt;Spudboy100 wrote about the possibility of building nanotech via

<EM>    &gt;laser deposition [...]  I don't think this is feasible.  Normal light has
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;wavelengths much  bigger than atomic scales.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a problem but perhaps not an insurmountable problem because you can
<BR>
make details much smaller that the wavelength of light you're using, even though
<BR>
Ernst Abbe &quot;proved&quot;  more than a 100 years ago that details smaller than half
<BR>
the wavelength of the light used to illuminate a specimen could never be
<BR>
resolved.  The thing is, Abbe made a hidden assumption, namely that the
<BR>
distance between the specimen and the source of light was large compared to
<BR>
the wavelength. In 1956 J.A. O'Keefe proposed a &quot;Scanning Near Field Microscope&quot;
<BR>
that would break the Abbe barrier. O'Keefe said that if light was emitted from a tiny
<BR>
hole less than a wavelength away from the specimen then the resolution would
<BR>
be limited only by the size of the hole, the wavelength of the light would be
<BR>
irrelevant. In 1972 Eric Ash proved experimentally that O'Keefe was correct.
<BR>
This technique may even be practical.  Back in 1993 Eric Betzig of ATT used visible
<BR>
light from a laser 10 nanometers above a sample to reveal details of the skeletal
<BR>
scaffolding inside a cell as small as 15 nanometers. Visible light is about 500 nm.
