<EM>&gt;with really serious genetic and physical modifications?

<P>The more I hear about the bizarre restrictions in the Land of the Free, the
<BR>
happier I am that I'm living in Oz. Can't be certain, but I'm fairly sure
<BR>
you could stroll in a swimsuit or a feathered chickensuit or a giant
<BR>
plastic pizza from the Yarra River to the middle of Melbourne without being
<BR>
molested by police (although they'd surely keep an eye on you, and it might
<BR>
help if there were several in the company, so you're not mistaken for a
<BR>
lone escaped lunatic or drug fiend having an unusual reaction). On the
<BR>
other hand, you *might* be assaulted by any number of jeering out-of-work
<BR>
young ruffians, the kind who are always picking on Bart Simpson. 
<BR>
<P>But I might be wrong about this. It's not something I've ever done, being
<BR>
too skinny and unsightly. Anyway, it's usually too damned cold.
<BR>
<P>If you chanced to be in Sydney during Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras, you'd be
<BR>
joshed for *not* wearing gold lame arseless panties, inflatable bra and
<BR>
wings, and glittery tiara, or full traditional nun's habit and bushy beard,
<BR>
while strolling down the centre of the road. Do they do that in Harvard
<BR>
Square? Even one day a year? If not, don't blame us anal Aussies.
