<BR>
<EM>&gt;the sociobiologist's move to make ethics a science ...  The problem with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is this:  Suppose I waved a magic wand and, all of a sudden, we knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything about all of our future behaviors.  ...  We now try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ask, &quot;given that So-and-so did such-and-such on such-and-such a day with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such-and-such intentions, heck, even given that her action has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such-and-such Total Consequences ... was this action right or wrong?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's not at all obvious what answer you'd give, if any, since no empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facts by themselves can establish that an action is right.  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I responded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;With a similar magic wand you could find out everything that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would ever think about ethics under any circumstances.  And isn't that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the closest Dan Fabulich could ever get to knowing what is ethical?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sure there might be some things about right and wrong that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could never know.  But no other approach to ethics could possibly reveal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more to Dan Fabulich than this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dan replied:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;True enough, but we'll never HAVE a magic wand like this. The prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would surely affect my way of thinking about ethics, so the prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would have to not only model my thoughts on the matter but its own effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on my thoughts on the matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course.  This is what economists do with &quot;game theory&quot;, and philosophers
<BR>
do with &quot;reflective equilibrium&quot;.  But I don't see why this is a criticism
<BR>
of the evol-psych approach.  Why is it so hard to imagine that once we
<BR>
understand in more detail where our ethical feelings come from and how
<BR>
pliable they are that we could reach an equilibrium where we are at peace
<BR>
with and accept those feelings, and the limited degree we have bent them?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not to mention problems like Newcomb's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Paradox, etc.  This problem gets harder still if I never die, friggin'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impossible if I ever make it to some Omega point, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand the relevance of these considerations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And, if that didn't convince you, on a practical level this problem is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harder than trying to predict the high/lows in temperature and when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will rain from now until my death (if ever) based solely on a few weather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vanes in Paraguay.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why must ethics be so prone to a &quot;butterfly effect&quot;?
<BR>
Must it really be something that we feel compelled to change whenever
<BR>
we seem to be reaching an equilibrium?
