<P>A very trendy, seductive, nice-sounding meme, but it does not accurately
<BR>
reflect reality.  I'd say this is part of the &quot;all conflicts occur for no
<BR>
real reason, everything bad is just a misunderstanding&quot; memeplex that
<BR>
infects the modern social sciences.  I suppose it would be nice if it were
<BR>
really that easy, but it isn't.
<BR>
<P>Quite often, conflicts occur because of real, deeply ingrained differences.
<BR>
Quite often they are the result of conflicts of interest that are actually
<BR>
insoluble at the time, regardless of how much good will everyone has for
<BR>
each other.  Perhaps the classic example will make things clear:
<BR>
<P>If I'm a Jew in Nazi Germany, the Nazis are my enemies.  No amount of
<BR>
tolerance or understanding on my part will change the fact that they want to
<BR>
kill me, and nothing I do is going to magically turn their genocide into a
<BR>
good thing.  In fact, I would say that I have a moral obligation to do
<BR>
everything in my power to oppose them, in as active a fashion as I can
<BR>
manage.  If, instead, I preach tolerance and understanding to my fellow
<BR>
Jews, I am either insane, stupid or evil.
