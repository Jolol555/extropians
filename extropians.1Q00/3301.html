<P>Hell of a guy.  Gone 22 yrs and I still miss him as if he died yesterday.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Knowing auto repair can give a person a real advantage in life.
</EM><BR>
<P>As Greg pointed out, auto repair develops reasoning ability.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Self-defense is still a very vital skill to have!
</EM><BR>
<P>I ended up getting into exactly one altercation in my life.  At a
<BR>
bowling alley.  My league teammate got into it with a guy from
<BR>
the other team, 8 guys ended up brawling for about 15 seconds,
<BR>
in a bowling pit, which if youve seen one, you know is not large
<BR>
enough to brawl in.  8 guys, quarter of a minute and not one
<BR>
single decent punch was thrown, not a tooth knocked out, not
<BR>
even a respectable black eye.  I was so mortified with embarrassment,
<BR>
I have never again set foot in an alley to this day.  {8^D  Looked
<BR>
more like a football victory huddle than a fight.  The 8 stooges.
<BR>
<P>Currently, I seldom go anywhere near the bad parts of town.  No
<BR>
business there.  My chances of being involved in a crime in Santa
<BR>
Clara county are slim indeed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My heart went out to you when you desribed the fearful environment that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existed when you attended college.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fearful?  Nah, we had a ball.  No money, lotsa fun.  I worked
<BR>
on campus as a tutor for physics, chemistry and calculus for $2.90
<BR>
an hour, so I wasnt totally penniless.  Married one of those students,
<BR>
16 yrs ago.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  It is sad that you did not major in your academic first love.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ill get over it.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The ramen noodles and koolaid diet is not healthy!
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Dont recommend it.  After I posted it, I called one of my
<BR>
roommates and we laughed about it.  He reminded me about the apples.
<BR>
We went to college in eastern Washington, so in the fall we went and
<BR>
bought u-pick-em apples for 8 cents a pound.  Stored em in the cellar
<BR>
where they kept thru-out the winter, altho they did tend to get a bit...
<BR>
chewy, towards spring.  {8^D  House rules were you couldnt eat
<BR>
*any* meal unless at least one apple was devoured along with it.
<BR>
We were not actually *hungry* you understand, just full of top ramen
<BR>
and apples.  {8^D haaaaa. hahahahaaaa.  haha. ha.  I hate apples to
<BR>
this day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...professional engineer, working very hard but being financially outclassed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a child whose father invested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wisely on her behalf in companies you did not have the insight then to invest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in!
</EM><BR>
<P>Ill get over it.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Children/young adults like her will have their own challenges though.
</EM><BR>
<P>Evidently countless others have already been down that road.  I just
<BR>
dont know any of them.  Until now, when I know several.  Actually,
<BR>
*all* the kids I now know personally have buttloads of money.  Strange
<BR>
times we are living in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I wish good luck to any parents on the list.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Looking back, I was too negative in my posts this weekend.
<BR>
Ive been emotionally screwed up since Lucy Knight died Thursday night.
<BR>
I cant *believe* they killed her!  She was soooo nice, and smart too!
<BR>
Isnt this absurd?  Mourning a TV character.  [[8-[  Wish they had taken
<BR>
Carter instead, let Lucy live.  Goodbye Lucy Knight.  sigh.
<BR>
<P>One more, if you are still reading this far: the previously mentioned former
<BR>
college roommate reminded me of the zoot suit.  He hadnt one when he got to
<BR>
to school so he and another of my roommates rode the bus downtown to
<BR>
the Goodwill store, came back with a zoot suit.  From like, the '30s.  {8^D
<BR>
What was funny is that it was actually a really nice suit, very expensive in
<BR>
its day and flawless, no wear at all, and fit him perfectly.  But it had
<BR>
these...
<BR>
shoulders.  It was made right at the peak of that trend where the designers
<BR>
thought ones shoulders should stick out either side about half a meter.  He
<BR>
was unsure about it but it was only 15 dollars, and it *was* a nice wool suit,
<BR>
so, zoot suit it is.  He had that suit the whole time we were at college.  As
<BR>
a little joke he wore it under his graduation gown, which looked very strange.
<BR>
<P>Had it thru graduate school, and now he is Dr. Rob, professor of engineering
<BR>
at the same school we went to, and he still has the zoot suit.  His wife
<BR>
loves that crazy thing.  hahahhahahaaaahahah.  {8^D  So you see, we
<BR>
were poor, but we had a lotta fun.  spike
