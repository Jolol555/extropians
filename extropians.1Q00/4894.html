<EM>&gt; &gt; As I have pointed out here before, it is the patent concept that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a socialist one--it derives from the labor theory of value--the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; discredited idea that work is valuable in itself.  Just because an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inventor does work, that's no reason to assume it is valuable, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more than a craftsman making artifacts no one wants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But patents make no statements about value.  A patent can be as worthless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as any other piece of property.  Do property rights in other fields derive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the labor theory of value?  Does the fact that someone can own land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imply that the land must be considered valuable?  No, any form of property,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including patents, can be worthless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Patents extend the notion of property into the abstract.  Whether this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good or effective is debatable, but it has nothing to do with the labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory of value.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a difference between traditional property rights and patents,
<BR>
though: property rights codify what already exists in reality--the fact
<BR>
that tangible property is scarce and unsharable.  It does not attach any
<BR>
more value to the property than what it already has.
<BR>
<P>Patents, in contrast, try to _create_ value by making scarce something
<BR>
which is not by nature, based on the assumption that inventors &quot;deserve&quot;
<BR>
to have this value created for them by virtue of their labor.  Much of
<BR>
the rhetoric behind patents assumes this moral desert, and it is _that_
<BR>
that is based on the labor theory of value (if not patent law itself).
<BR>
I agree that this may not necessarily make a worthless idea valuable--
<BR>
indeed 90% of patents are nothing but wallpaper anyway.  But it does
<BR>
nonetheless amount to a valuable government entitlement to those idea-
<BR>
space homesteaders whose inventions _do_ have practical applications,
<BR>
and it ensures that only that one inventor's applications are the ones
<BR>
that reach market, despite what other applications the market might
<BR>
demand if others could use the invention.
<BR>
<P>I should also note that this particular line of rhetoric is fairly
<BR>
recent, and that the origin of US patents was based on a slightly
<BR>
different (though still somewhat socialist) idea: that the state should
<BR>
encourage inventors to publish their work, rather than maintaining it as a
<BR>
trade secret, for the good of society.
