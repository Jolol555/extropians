Max More wrote [on who should vote]:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Funny, this very topic came up in a class last night (a class in which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;introduced transhumanism). My vote is for replacing the current system with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a working Foresight Exchange (ideas futures). I suppose you can still have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one-warm-human-body/one vote, but you'd be voting for representatives who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would have to take into account the results of the Foresight Exchange. Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas on how, constitutionally, you could force the representatives to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Exchange results in their legislation? If we could get the idea futures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;process widely accepted, it would tend to put pressure on legislators to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;follow it (especially if you could easily go on the web and check a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;representatives voting record against the ideas market's recommendations).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But it would be good if there were a way of compelling reps to follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this--and a good democratic argument can be made that this would mean a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pure form of democracy in the sense of following the informed will of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people. (Given how much Americans love to gamble, I suspect that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;participation rates would be higher than we see in many elections too.)
</EM><BR>
<P>A subject dear to my heart of course :-).  The tricky issue is disentangling
<BR>
facts and values.  But I see three approaches worth exploring.
<BR>
<P>1) Have courts enforce a rule that policy makers must always (except for
<BR>
specific exceptions) prefer a market estimate over other sources when
<BR>
estimating matters of fact.  Of course decisions also depend on values,
<BR>
and it is harder to get markets to estimate values.  In principle, policy
<BR>
makers could use this ambiguity to avoid this rule, but in practice I
<BR>
think the rule would bite a lot.  If a market said drug A was more safe
<BR>
and effective than drug B for treating a given problem, it would be hard
<BR>
for policy makers to ban drug A and not drug B, unless they appealed
<BR>
to something like one drug being produced by a monopoly, or by foreigners.
<BR>
Similarly, if a market said a given treaty made war more likely the treaty
<BR>
could not be approved on the justification that it would keep us out of war,
<BR>
thought it might be approved on other justifications.
<BR>
<P>2) Have the rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says
<BR>
that there is more than an X (=75%?) chance that a random jury, chosen
<BR>
twenty years later and paid twice the average wage to study the question
<BR>
for a full year, would agree that D was better than the decision that would
<BR>
have resulted had this market rule not been followed.  Now I can see some
<BR>
problems with this, but it relies a lot less on courts to work.
<BR>
<P>3) Choose some official national objective function, something like GDP,
<BR>
only more carefully measured and trying to include more contributions like
<BR>
the value of leisure, etc.  Have some independent and well monitored agency
<BR>
continually update this estimate of the state of the nation.  Then have the
<BR>
rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says that among
<BR>
all the decisions markets are considering (including letting policy makers
<BR>
do what they want), D gives the highest conditional estimate for this
<BR>
national objective.  I think this is the most promising approach.
