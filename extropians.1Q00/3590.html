<P>&lt;&lt; there is no way a person of any dominant ability is &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>OK there it is, right there in that word dominant. I see it again and again.  
<BR>
Your need to retain yoru dominance shows itself again and again. 
<BR>
<P><P>Mike we are saying the same thing, you would like to keep the superiority of 
<BR>
intelligence. I see little difference in your case tha nmine, except you are 
<BR>
seeing your assertations as justifiable from your position of superiority, 
<BR>
and I am casting a less complimentary slant on your case.
<BR>
<P>(And you add a lot of needless piddle about crying your yeys out and 
<BR>
&quot;feelings&quot;&gt;: - )
<BR>
<P>I am going to put it out there one more time and then stop bothering the list 
<BR>
with my own piddle. Inherently it's useless, and since Howard Gardner is a 
<BR>
respected child psychologist and Mike Lorrey is not, little will be lost if 
<BR>
all the Mikes and Micks in the world hate him and what he represents.
<BR>
But the bottom line is, this practice of teaching has in fact *enabled* &quot;less 
<BR>
dominant&quot; intelligence to gain validatin, which build self esteem in kids, 
<BR>
which in turn opens them up to new learning capabilties.  They develop the 
<BR>
fdominant skills of logic and verbal skill more rapidly, learn more and get 
<BR>
more out of life.
<BR>
<P>To bemoan the fact, after the fact, -- all becasue it is egaletarian (a much 
<BR>
more acurate word than PC) is not productive, it is... ahem... RETRO
<BR>
<P>No mo'
