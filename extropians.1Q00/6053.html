<EM>&gt; &gt; Well the transparency I advocate is mutual, two-way, transparency.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Meaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the individual would be no more subject to surveillance than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government.  In fact my suggestion is &quot;power equivolent surveillance,&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the more power you have to meddle in others lives, the *more* you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subject to surveillance.  In this scheme, the President and members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; congress would live in a virtual fish bowl and we the people would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to know virtually *everything* about their political, business and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; affairs.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I share your enthusiasm for accountability for our elected and appointed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leaders, however your proposal that they have more surveillance than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average person runs counter to every security protocol of any leader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;security detail that ever kept its subject alive for more than 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minutes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  In fact this sort of power-proportional transparency is already 
<BR>
in effect in some ways.  Right now we can know much more about President 
<BR>
Clinton than he could ever know about you.  I know where and when he travels 
<BR>
abroad.  I know why he has gone there and whom he talked to and what they 
<BR>
talked about.  If I wanted to I could, in a matter of minutes, find out what 
<BR>
his agenda is for next week, where he'll be and what he'll be doing.  In 
<BR>
fact its probably fair to say that Clinton is the *most* surveilled person 
<BR>
on the planet, as it should be.  And he has been kept alive by his security 
<BR>
detail for a little more than 5 minutes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; When we have gotten past national sovereignty and moved on to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; democratic global governance, there will be no need for such things as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; secrets and national security.  At that point we will only be concerned 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (1) individual security and (2) global security.  Both of those types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; security would best be served by ubiquitous transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;formation of other corporate structures as well...
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big scary 
<BR>
corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human rights? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an 
<BR>
insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a consumer 
<BR>
would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that ability 
<BR>
is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allowed to become law.
</EM><BR>
<P>Examples, please.  Even if that is the case, that is not what *I* advocate 
<BR>
(at least not yet).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Power corrupts, so why give the power brokers more of it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't advocate that at all.  I propose giving more power to those are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; powerful.  I do propose opening the flood gates of surveillance, but its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; two-way floodgate, and I'd call for more information about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; flowing to the people than the other way around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since the powerful will have greater computational resources, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to make better use of the intelligence value of this ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance, so even if everyone has the same 'access' (or even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful have 'less' access, they will still make better use of the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and will be able to oppress people more as a result. Surveillance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merely an intelligence gathering channel. Its value is directly related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to how much you can process in a given amount of time, and how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;useless data you can filter out. Unless you are going to mandate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone have exactly the same amount of computing power, no more, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less, then your scheme cannot work as you envision it, and it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become a tool of repression for the powerful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, not really.  It doesn't take much computing power at all to 
<BR>
browse an efficiently designed and frequently updated database.  Each 
<BR>
citizen would not have to bear the onerous burden of creating and 
<BR>
maintaining their own database.  The database would be publicly maintained 
<BR>
(of course under the glare of a great deal of transparency).  When I wanted 
<BR>
the info, I'd just cruise on over to the database, log in and have a look 
<BR>
around.  Not much different than what happens now when you go to google.com. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have much advantage using a 1ghz Pentium III over somebody 
<BR>
using a 66mhz 486 in browsing such a database.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
