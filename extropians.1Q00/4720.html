<P>And your point ...?
<BR>
<P>Clue: I didn't vote for the clowns, but I still have to live with the
<BR>
consequences of their policies. The fundamental difference between
<BR>
a democracy and a tyranny boils down to the difference between a
<BR>
dictatorship of a majority and a dictatorship of one: both are
<BR>
equally onerous if you're on the sharp end of their stick. More to the
<BR>
point, I'm becoming more convinced these days that it is _impossible_
<BR>
for human beings to achieve a 100% non-coercive government in any
<BR>
group much larger than two or three individuals: people are perverse.
<BR>
<P>The way most of us learn to deal with this dilemma is to support the least
<BR>
coercive, least interventionist governmental system on offer. However,
<BR>
for most human beings, avoiding being on the receiving end of a mugging
<BR>
comes higher up their list of priorities than abstracts like free speech
<BR>
and freedom from intrusive surveillance. So they conflate physical
<BR>
security (freedom from violent attack) with social security (freedom
<BR>
from oppression) and vote for friendly fascists who promise to get tough
<BR>
on crime.
<BR>
<P>I think to some extent we're living through a very interesting period,
<BR>
politically -- in the sense of the Chinese curse. Since about 1960, TV has
<BR>
played an increasingly central part in determining political popularity in
<BR>
the democracies: so substantive arguments have been replaced by ten-second
<BR>
sound bites and integrity has been replaced by the ability to look good
<BR>
under a spotlight. The net hasn't yet made a huge impact on politics, Jesse
<BR>
Ventura apart, although it will, in the next couple of years: at that
<BR>
point, I expect the personal doings of politicians to become substantially
<BR>
transparent (unless various paranoid pols manage to stamp out anonymity
<BR>
on the net before this happens). With it, the _way_ politics is played in the
<BR>
west will have to change, and the current generation of control freaks
<BR>
hiding behind scripted facades will be replaced by something different. I
<BR>
hope the something turns out to be better, but I'm not optimistic -- given
<BR>
that almost everybody who seeks political power shouldn't be allowed within
<BR>
spitting distance of it.
