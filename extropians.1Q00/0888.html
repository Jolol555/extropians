<P>
I have watched these posts over the months and have often wondered, from a 
<BR>
futurist point of view; why is everyone so techno-optimistic?  It seems as if 
<BR>
everyone lack that bit of pessimismus (using the Teutonic adjective) that 
<BR>
might serve as a reality-check.  What brings this to mind, for me, is an 
<BR>
article written by Sir Winston Churchill back in 1931 for the New York Times 
<BR>
(I am guessing it was the 'Times') that echoed Aldous Huxley's forecast of 
<BR>
test-tube fetal gestation (babies from zygote to birth-under glass) that 
<BR>
would be part of the world of the 1970's.   
<BR>
<P>I also remember reading some article by J.B.S. Haldane writing of (during 
<BR>
WW2) breakthroughs in biology that would lead to synthetically-grown foods; 
<BR>
which as a side-effect would turn the sea's purple (rhodopsin?).  In the 
<BR>
fullness of future history, I am sure that everyone who is optimistic will be 
<BR>
proven correct. 
<BR>
<P>What I wonder about, is why most people here believe that all this can and 
<BR>
will be achieved by 2050 or 2099 at the absolute latest?  Things like 
<BR>
massive-scale nano-production, solar power based on nano, human consciousness 
<BR>
that gets absorbed into a vastly, powerful computer system. Why in Century 
<BR>
21, rather then century 26?  Reading about the development of technology from 
<BR>
&nbsp;BBC\ITN journalist James Burke; one can see that all technical developments 
<BR>
are affected profoundly by societal decisions and wants.  Who can say that 
<BR>
things will not drag on in some areas-even of in computation-technology soars 
<BR>
ahead?
<BR>
<P>(Answer: computation will drive other technologies as they are now driving 
<BR>
pharamceutical development in un-covering drugs that are the most effective 
<BR>
v. ineffectual compounds) See, even I wax happy, sometimes.
