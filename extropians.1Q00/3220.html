</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunate in that it takes a mature and introspective mind to answer these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions well, and there is little guidance available from the adults around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them that are still imurred in the 'survival' mind set.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Im still in that mindset, tho my circs do not really
<BR>
require it.  Its like I am hardwired to work, save, work, save.
<BR>
<P>Americans over 70 have a well-known hoarding instinct, thought
<BR>
to have been caused by their 1930s era great depression
<BR>
experiences.  With my grandmother, if you gave her a set
<BR>
of expensive towels, for instance, she would never use them,
<BR>
she would save them back, using the old threadbare ones until
<BR>
they were tattered rags.  Depression mentality.
<BR>
<P>I have a recession mentality: my parents and grandparents
<BR>
worked at Cape Canaveral during the downturn of 1969,
<BR>
right after the first Apollo launch and before the shuttle.
<BR>
Many lost jobs, many lost their homes, Titusville FL was a
<BR>
ghost town for several years.  Now I share many of the
<BR>
characteristics of depression mentality, just less of it.
<BR>
<P>Knowing what I now know, dynaminc optimism and all
<BR>
that, I *still* cannot bring myself to invest in the well-known
<BR>
high flyers, the few stocks that have been making fortunes:
<BR>
microsloth, aol, you know them.
<BR>
<P>Take Amazon.com for instance.  Please.  Take them.  Away.
<BR>
There is a company which I neeeever would have guessed would
<BR>
be worth the jillions people have been paying.  Annnnybody
<BR>
can set up a bookseller online, whats special about Amazon?
<BR>
Single click to order?  Who is to say they wont become the
<BR>
poster child for silly patents, and lose clientele to other firms
<BR>
that require two or more clicks, just as a protest?
<BR>
<P>Yet my stance on Amazon has been wrong, so far.  So now
<BR>
pretty much anything I tell the very young is under suspicion.
<BR>
So, that gray veil over the future is already in place for me.
<BR>
I cant see what is coming.
<BR>
<P>One more please.  Heres one you will rarely hear: a person
<BR>
discussing a huge stock loss they had.  Anybody will tell you
<BR>
their successes, but here is a collossal loss: I was heavily invested
<BR>
in a big bricks and mortar company, Lock.heed.Mar.tin.  I knew
<BR>
the products, I worked there, seemed like a good bet, but in
<BR>
fact it was a terrible bet for reasons I never could have foreseen.
<BR>
The stock was at 56 a year ago last June, now its 17 1/2, and
<BR>
I suspect we havent hit bottom.  It has nothing to do with the
<BR>
market for communications satellites, which is good.  This
<BR>
company cannot recruit and hold young people.  I turn 40
<BR>
this year and I am *still* in the lowest quartile in age there.
<BR>
Consequently our average salary is way up which drives
<BR>
profits down.  And theres more to it than that, but I ramble
<BR>
excessively today.  spike
