<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a disbeliever in patents, this article warmed my heart,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.around.com/patent.html">http://www.around.com/patent.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As a hopeful inventor can someone explain to me why patents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; considered bad?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; their hard won intellectual efforts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No.  In a free capitalist society, people should profit from the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exchange of goods or services with other individuals, or any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; freely entered profitable contract or dealing.  By contrast, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obtain a patent, you prevent me, via a state granted monopoly on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particular implementation of an idea, from using my own intelligence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; labor and industry to similarly profit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is that it is pretty difficult for the second guy to prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he never had any input from the first.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is that my problem?  That does not justify using the machinery of
<BR>
the state to prohibit me from using my own intelligence and labor as I
<BR>
see fit.  That's what your use of a patent to restrict me does. 
<BR>
<P>Moreover, under what theory of rights do you obtain exclusive
<BR>
ownership of a technology just because you were first?  Only one in
<BR>
which rights derive from state grants.  We all routinely benefit from
<BR>
civilization and nobody makes us pay.  I'm typing in a house that has
<BR>
central heating.  I enjoy this but I haven't paid the inventor of
<BR>
houses or furnaces.  What a calamity!
<BR>
<P>This is a non-problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any moron can look at an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invention and smack their head, saying, oh yeah I see how that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In what way does this justify the state's stepping in and assigning
<BR>
ownership of a technology?  
<BR>
<P>Deal freely with other people, or are you afraid to do so and have to
<BR>
call in the nanny state to help?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If&gt; they go and start making their own without ever having actually bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original device from the original inventor, are they really an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventor, or just a cheap shallow crook with no consideration for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others?
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it theft to learn from others' ideas?
<BR>
<P>Maybe the original inventor should have made the person in question
<BR>
sign an NDA.
<BR>
<P>Nah, that would require the inventor to actually work hard to protect
<BR>
this right.  Better for the state to just give her a handout, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This is coercive, oppressive and destructive, as well as against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You are mistaken.  The parallel is entirely in your head.
<BR>
<P>In this case it is you who are arguing for the omnipotent state to act
<BR>
as the arbiter of property, and it is I who am arguing for free
<BR>
trade.  You are taking the socialist line here.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is intellectual property worth less because it springs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes so easily from the creative mind?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, make all the profits you want off your legitimate intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; property.  (Hint -- if your so-called property derives from a grant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from the government, its legitimacy is highly questionable.  In this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case, it's a government hand out.)  I make profits from my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intellectual property -- I write computer programs, and help people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrate other peoples' software into their systems.  These profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do not depend on coercing others into not doing likewise.  That's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bullies' game, not fit for free women and men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However patent protection makes sure that EVERY user of your invention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pays his fair share,
</EM><BR>
<P>The universal sign of the socialist argument!  Let the government
<BR>
decide what is &quot;fair&quot; and redistribute the wealth accordingly.
<BR>
<P>No thanks, I prefer free dealing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; which is not the case currently with software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where you have between 20-50% piracy rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does the existence of burglary justify the government deciding who
<BR>
owns which houses and doling them out in arbitrary 17 year periods to
<BR>
whoever can claim them first?  Please take your statist schemes elsewhere.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those who pay for software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licenses wind up paying for the pirates, feel gyped, and are more likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to commit piracy themselves as a result. They know they are getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shafted, but not by who they think they are... 
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I can protect my own property thank you.   I don't need the nanny
<BR>
state and its protection racket.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James
