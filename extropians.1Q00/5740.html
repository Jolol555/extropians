<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is hardly likely (unless you are Buddhist), that when sweeping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the cobwebs in the corner of your house and sucking up a spider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into your vacuum cleaner, you view yourself a an evil-doer the likes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Stalin or Hitler.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe (but don't YET know for sure) that the lowest level
<BR>
of life forms like plants, or perhaps the bacteria in our digestive
<BR>
systems, are mere non sentient, non feeling mechanical robots.  It is
<BR>
no worse to kill them than it is to switch off a computer.  But at
<BR>
some level (we'll know this some day when we know what
<BR>
consciousness/sentence really is) you cross a sentient threshold.
<BR>
When you get to animals like fish and cows... while I don't think it
<BR>
is as bad as Stalin or Hitler, I still think killing them is is bad.
<BR>
I will forever feel guilty for being such a &quot;mass murderer&quot; until I am
<BR>
powerful enough to some day pay them back, perhaps by resurrecting
<BR>
them into a perfect &quot;cow heaven&quot; which I would think would include
<BR>
&quot;uplifting&quot;...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If, you are of a mind that values species diversity, as has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussed in other threads, then you are of a mind that &quot;evolution&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is good, that *death* is good, because without death, you have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way of selecting for the better genes that allow the evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clock to slowly lift us up out of chaos and drive back the evil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entropy.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like eating another animal in order to survive, though it is
<BR>
good since it is better than not surviving, it is still bad or simply
<BR>
the lessor of two evils.  It would be much better to find some way to
<BR>
survive without eating an animal.  In the past, survival of the
<BR>
fittest was the only way to achieve diversity and growth.  But now
<BR>
that we have grown to the point where we can grow without primitive
<BR>
and bad &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; we should hope that we can some day
<BR>
stop all extinction, and eventually all death.  And again, some day
<BR>
restore all sentient beings that have died in the past.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you argue, that the ETs should save us from evil, then you should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *also* argue that when we have the capabilities, *we* should uplift
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and make immortal every creature on the planet.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!  Definitely.  (At least for all sentient or feeling
<BR>
creatures.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then since everything would be (relatively) immortal, we would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to stop all evolution as soon as we hit the material and energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources (*very* quickly).
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are limits to resources, we have to make
<BR>
trade offs.  In the past people could either kill animals to eat and
<BR>
not die, or die.  If we don't have the resources to resurrect and
<BR>
uplift all cows that have ever given their lives to feed man, then
<BR>
we'll just have to keep hoping that some day we'll have enough power
<BR>
and resources to some day achieve this to pay them back and live and
<BR>
suffer with our guilt until then.  If something even remotely close to
<BR>
Tippler's omega point is possible, we will eventually easily be able
<BR>
to do all these kinds of things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only way out of this that I can see, would be for uplifted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people/animals/plants to &quot;discover&quot; that they are unworthy
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no way out!  There is no way out.  Just because some
<BR>
animal was unlucky enough to be born before there is no longer any
<BR>
death is a horribly unjust way to determine &quot;worthiness&quot;.  If we make
<BR>
it to the time when we become immortal and supper beings, you think we
<BR>
would be the ones that are &quot;worthy&quot; for such!?  Now Way!  In reality,
<BR>
each of our ancestors worked and made the world a little better place
<BR>
when they left than when they came into it.  They are the real
<BR>
creators of us and this glorious world in which there is about to be
<BR>
no more death.  They are the ones that more or less freely gave all
<BR>
this to us.  If anything, we should resurrect them, and give all that
<BR>
we have to them, and kill ourselves if need be, since they are the
<BR>
ones that created all that we have.  They deserve it much more than we
<BR>
do since they are the ones that created it in spite of having almost
<BR>
nothing to work with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the ETs don't disturb us it is because the natural process of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution works.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, evolution does work, but there are infinitely
<BR>
better and faster ways to do what evolution is doing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the authors of &quot;Rare Earth&quot; are correct, and higher life-forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are rare, then it is no surprise that the machinery of evolution,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that some of us view as evil, is allowed to persist.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not understand, this makes no sense to me.  Just
<BR>
because higher life-forms are rare has nothing to do with whether or
<BR>
not evolution is bad, and whether or not we can hope there are much
<BR>
better ways...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The value of what some view as evil, to those observing may well be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incalculable.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope not!  I hope we can find infinitely better
<BR>
way so accomplish whatever it is you guys are arguing can only be
<BR>
accomplished by such frustration and suffering.
