A Deep Anarchy List has been created.
<BR>
<P>In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF &quot;THE STATE&quot;
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</A>&gt;, Max More,
<BR>
Ph.D., President, Extropy Institute &lt;<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</A>&gt;
<BR>
(writing as Max T. O'Connor) coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Traditional anarchists want to abolish the &quot;State.&quot; In
<BR>
planning their strategies and in doing their thinking about
<BR>
this they rarely question the existence or fundamental
<BR>
nature of their enemy. This situation wouldn't be so bad if
<BR>
it wasn't for the fact that their mistaken beliefs often
<BR>
lead them into counterproductive political strategies. Thus
<BR>
we observe the ludicrous sight of self-named anarchists
<BR>
joining political parties (usually the Libertarian Party) in
<BR>
order to hasten the end of the system. The idea seems
<BR>
to be: We can remove it by being absorbed by it!
<BR>
<P>I want to suggest that when we talk of &quot;the State&quot; we are
<BR>
not talking of any entity, either concrete or abstract. I
<BR>
will provide two main arguments for this: One from
<BR>
considerations of methodological individualism, and another
<BR>
that could be called &quot;the argument from fuzziness.&quot; &quot;Deep
<BR>
Anarchy&quot; is the view that results from these thoughts; it is
<BR>
the idea that we already live in an anarchy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The purpose of the Deep Anarchy List is to explore the
<BR>
deepest aspects of coercive political systems -- which
<BR>
manifest in individual human minds. According to Robert
<BR>
Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance':
<BR>
<P>&quot;But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a
<BR>
government or to avoid repairs of a motorcycle because it is
<BR>
a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as
<BR>
long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is
<BR>
possible. The true system, the real system, is our present
<BR>
construction of systematic thought itself, rationality
<BR>
itself. And if a factory is torn down but the rationality
<BR>
which produced it is left standing, then that rationality
<BR>
will simply produce another factory. If a revolution
<BR>
destroys a systematic government, but the systematic
<BR>
patterns of thought that produced that government are left
<BR>
intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the
<BR>
succeeding government...&quot;
<BR>
<P>A Deep Anarchist is someone who has examined and radically
<BR>
changed certain &quot;systematic patterns of thought&quot; which most
<BR>
traditional anarchists take for granted, without question or
<BR>
challenge.
