<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4TH ANNUAL MEETING: 2ND CALL FOR PAPERS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BINDING, INTEGRATION, AND DISSOCIATION
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universite Libre de Bruxelles
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JUNE 29th - JULY 2nd, 2000: BRUSSELS, BELGIUM
<BR>
<P><P>The fourth meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of
<BR>
Consciousness will be held from June 29th to July 2nd, 2000, at the
<BR>
Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) on the theme of &quot;The
<BR>
Unity of Consciousness&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Consciousness has many elements, from sensory experiences such as
<BR>
vision, audition, and bodily sensation, to nonsensory aspects such as
<BR>
volition, emotion, memory, and thought. The apparent unity of these
<BR>
elements is striking: all are presented to us as experiences of a single
<BR>
subject, and all seem to be contained within a unified field of
<BR>
experience, but this apparent unity raises many questions. How do
<BR>
diverse systems in the brain co-operate to produce a unified experience?
<BR>
Are there conditions under which this unity breaks down? And is
<BR>
conscious experience really unified at all?
<BR>
<P>In recent years, these questions have been addressed by researchers in
<BR>
many fields. Neurophysiologists and computational modelers have
<BR>
investigated the mechanisms by which binding and integration of
<BR>
disparate information may take place in the brain, producing a unified
<BR>
experience. Neuropsychological research has documented a large variety
<BR>
of dissociation disorders in which damage to specific brain regions
<BR>
leads to dissociated experiences, suggesting the apparent disintegration
<BR>
of a unified subject. Cognitive psychologists have investigated the role
<BR>
of attention and learning in the integration of information, and have
<BR>
examined conditions under which perception and action, or subjective
<BR>
experience and behavior, can become dissociated. Some cognitive modelers
<BR>
have suggested that unity is a mere illusion, while others have
<BR>
emphasized the role of a central unifying system in integrating sensory
<BR>
and motor experience. Meanwhile philosophers have analyzed just what the unity
<BR>
of consciousness comes to, and whether we have reason to believe that it
<BR>
exists.
<BR>
<P>The fourth ASSC conference will bring together researchers from numerous
<BR>
disciplines to discuss these issues. Topics that will be addressed
<BR>
include:
<BR>
<P>- the role of synchronous oscillations in binding and integration
<BR>
- other neurophysiological mechanisms for integration of information
<BR>
- computational models of binding, integration, and unity
<BR>
- neuropsychological disorders with dissociation of experience
<BR>
- the role of attention and learning in unification of experience
<BR>
- dissociations between perceptual systems
<BR>
- implicit vs. explicit aspects of knowledge and learning
<BR>
- dissociations between perception, thought, and action
<BR>
- the relationship between information integration and unified experience
<BR>
- analysis of the concept of unity
<BR>
- unification of consciousness and self across time
<BR>
- the existence or nonexistence of unified consciousness
<BR>
<P>Confirmed plenary speakers include: Rodney Cotterill, Zoltan Dienes,
<BR>
Andreas Engel, Glyn Humphreys, Susan Hurley, Pierre Perruchet, Randy
<BR>
O'Reilly, Sydney Shoemaker, Catherine Tallon-Baudry, Giulio Tononi,
<BR>
Anne Treisman, Francisco Varela, Andrew Young, and Semir Zeki.

<BR>
CALL FOR PAPERS &amp; POSTERS
<BR>
-------------------------
<BR>
<P>While the central theme of ASSC4 is &quot;The unity of consciousness&quot;, and
<BR>
plenary sessions will deal largely with this theme, speakers in
<BR>
concurrent sessions are invited to talk on any topic relevant to the
<BR>
scientific study of consciousness. Submissions that include
<BR>
physiological, psychological, philosophical, and computational
<BR>
perspectives are all welcome.
<BR>
<P>Submissions for both posters and talks will be accepted. Any person may
<BR>
present only one submission, but may be co-author on several. Oral
<BR>
presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, to be followed by a
<BR>
10-minute discussion period.
<BR>
<P>Plenary lectures, symposia, concurrent sessions, and poster sessions
<BR>
will all be held on the Solbosch campus of the Universite Libre de
<BR>
Bruxelles.

<BR>
CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
<BR>
---------------------------
<BR>
<P>This notice is also intended as a call for workshop presenters. One of
<BR>
the aims of this meeting is to allow researchers to gain a background in
<BR>
areas that they may know little about. Towards that end a number of
<BR>
workshops are planned. Is there a topic you or perhaps someone in your
<BR>
laboratory might want to present? Some participants in the conference
<BR>
would be very interested in learning about technical matters such as
<BR>
fMRI or other important brain imaging techniques. Others might enjoy a
<BR>
seminar on a philosophical topic. If you have recently published a book
<BR>
or major article on some topic you might want to lead a discussion on
<BR>
it.  As with papers the focus of all workshops should naturally fit
<BR>
within the overall theme of the conference. A non-exclusive list of
<BR>
possible topics might include:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- The latest methods and implications of various brain scanning
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, SQUID, ERP)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Blindsight, neglect, or other neuropsychological syndromes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Neural network or other theoretical models of processing in areas
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;related to conscious activity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Current models of the visual system
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Consciousness and metacognition
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Criteria for the ascription of consciousness
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Philosophical issues concerning unity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Phenomenological methods for investigating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Please suggest other sample topics, or modify the above!!
<BR>
<P>Workshops will be held in parallel sessions on the morning and
<BR>
afternoon of June 29th. Each workshop is intended to last
<BR>
approximately three hours. The sizes of workshops will vary between a
<BR>
minimum of 10 to a maximum of around 25 people. Workshops that do not
<BR>
achieve the minimum enrollment of 10 people will not be offered.
<BR>
Workshop presenters will receive a minimum honorarium of 20000 BEF.
<BR>
Worskhop registration fee will be 2000 BEF.
<BR>
