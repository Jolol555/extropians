<EM>&gt; trustworthy.  I'm afraid that may not happen until after some nano-disaster

<EM>&gt; Zero, if you keep thinking like that you may wind up the liberal Democratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contender for the presidency in 2020!  Mike Lorrey will grind his teeth when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he hears you discuss 'nano control' for the sake of the public good!  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be campaigning on the promise to bring to justice the underground group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of plotters known as the 'Yudkowskians' who want to bring on a massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity! lol! :)

<P>Zero isn't evil, merely misinformed, ignorant, or infected with control
<BR>
memes. The proper extropian way to make sure that nano doesn't get out
<BR>
of control is to be one of those people on the forefront, and develop
<BR>
your own nano, but nano that acts like an immune system, on the lookout
<BR>
for out of control nano, and able to eliminate the cancer when it
<BR>
occurs. Once you've seeded the earth with your T-cell nanos, then we are
<BR>
all safe, and you will be our hero...;)
<BR>
<P>The best defense is a good offense.
