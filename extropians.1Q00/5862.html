Well, trying as hard as I could to reserve judgment for as long as I could, 
<BR>
I nevertheless was compelled to conclude early on that &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; was 
<BR>
deeply and thoroughly BAD. It STINKS. I left asking the question (as I often 
<BR>
do after a truly terrible movie), &quot;How do hundreds of people spend 
<BR>
$100,000,000 and months and months of hard work making a movie and not 
<BR>
notice that the script is TERRIBLE?&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I enjoyed the film much more then you did but was still disappointed.  I 
<BR>
look forward to the Val Kilmer film with a very similar theme that is coming 
<BR>
out later this summer.  The buzz is that it will be the film to get a good 
<BR>
response.  Remember how their was first 'Deep Impact' and later 
<BR>
'Armageddon'?  Actually while 'Armageddon' was more fun I really enjoyed the 
<BR>
other film more for the portrayal of the scenes on the comet.  I want Morgan 
<BR>
Freeman as our president! lol

<P>A weak script gets greenlighted by a studio and the producers and director 
<BR>
blow it by for whatever reasons not overhauling it to produce quality work.  
<BR>
The actors may or may not have a say in things.  After that, the 
<BR>
movie-making machine is a giant headless monster (bureaucracy) that lumbers 
<BR>
forward to crank out the film regardless of quality.  Everyone just does 
<BR>
their job which is a small part of it generally.
<BR>
<P>I have a good friend here in Anchorage named Grant Walther who is in his 
<BR>
fifties and went to a film school in California (no longer in existance) 
<BR>
which was funded by Disney.  Among his classmates were Tim Burton!
<BR>
<P>My friend worked on the Alaska pipeline during the summers to pay for 
<BR>
school.  He worked with a notorious group of welders that became the 
<BR>
inspiration for an award-winning script he wrote about a man who falls afoul 
<BR>
of the oil companies and has to fight for his life.  He has collected many 
<BR>
'glowing' rejection letters from major studios saying they loved the script 
<BR>
and wished him success but it is not what they were looking for.  He has 
<BR>
several other interesting writing projects now in the works.
<BR>
<P>His regret now is that he did not focus like a laser beam on his career 
<BR>
right after his schooling but he got distracted with making a living and 
<BR>
finding the right woman(he never did marry).  At one time it looked like he 
<BR>
was in, he was signed up to be a scriptwriter for a project with the wife of 
<BR>
Fellini!  But she died a month later!  The deal collapsed.
<BR>
<P>He gave up an offer to attend law school because he wanted to become a 
<BR>
film-maker.  His younger brother became the lawyer and his extended family 
<BR>
has lost faith in his dreams but I think he will make it.  This man has the 
<BR>
raw talent in that he has technical understanding and creative imagination 
<BR>
combined.  Cameron, Spielburg and most great directors have this combination 
<BR>
also.  I hope someday I can tell you all about a film of his that is about 
<BR>
to be released, perhaps in a few years.
<BR>
<P>'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' is a glaring example of this.  I wish 
<BR>
someone had approached Lucas and told him things needed to be changed.  I 
<BR>
have heard doing that is like trying to correct Darth Vader on a bad day! 
<BR>
lol  My dream is to have been a script doctor for the film.  I would have 
<BR>
had Anakin living in wretched slavery with his mother murdered by a much 
<BR>
more imposing slave master.  Anakin kills him and you see in his eyes the 
<BR>
hate that will one day lead to Darth Vader.
<BR>
<P>I have read one reason the previous films were so good was that he had other 
<BR>
people direct some of them.  And he had some real head-on collisions with 
<BR>
these directors over things like cutting out stupid 'cutesey' aliens and 
<BR>
allowing Han Solo to be himself in the scene where when Leia says, &quot;I love 
<BR>
you&quot; he replies &quot;I know&quot; instead of, &quot;I love you too.&quot;  Had Lucas had his 
<BR>
way his films would have been the lesser for it.  Lucas claims the next film 
<BR>
with Anakin as a teen will really take off story-wise.  I hope so.
<BR>
<P>I read in the latest issue of 'Cinemascape' that John Travolta is glowing 
<BR>
about his new film, 'Battlefield Earth.'  He claims that though it was done 
<BR>
on a mid-size budget it is tremendous for both FX and especially acting.  
<BR>
Travolta actually plays the villain!!  In the book the alien bad guys were 
<BR>
nothing like humans except for being massively bulky bipeds that could not 
<BR>
breath our atmosphere.  But because of budget limitations the aliens will 
<BR>
resemble klingons that are nine feet tall!  I'm disappointed already.  I 
<BR>
wanted Travolta as the hero.  I will reserve judgement till I see the film.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
