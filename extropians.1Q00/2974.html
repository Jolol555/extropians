<EM>&gt; &gt;thanks, I had not read this... As always I am impressed with Max's writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm toying with the idea of setting up a Deep Anarchy list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;THE STATE&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</A>&gt;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Max coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to Max T. O'Connor (aka Max More):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Traditional anarchists want to abolish the &quot;State.&quot; In planning their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategies and in doing their thinking about this they rarely question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the existence or fundamental nature of their enemy. This situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that their mistaken beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often lead them into counterproductive political strategies. Thus we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observe the ludicrous sight of self-named anarchists joining political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties (usually the Libertarian Party) in order to hasten the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system. The idea seems to be: We can remove it by being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absorbed by it!
</EM><BR>
<P>Its not totally a bad idea. Considering how much libertarian thought has
<BR>
been shaping politics the last ten years, it does seem to be working a
<BR>
bit. The problem is that in joining the establishment, your goals become
<BR>
diluted, and the people wind up with a sweetened, more palatable and
<BR>
managable version. Witness how socialists in the democratic parties of
<BR>
the west were able to turn former laissez faire economies into compound
<BR>
economies of mercantilists using socialist governments to manage and
<BR>
dopify the people, and to allow and organize the externalization of
<BR>
mercantilists costs. Because of this, there was never a revolution of
<BR>
the proletariat in the west. 
<BR>
To establish a true anarchy a 'Deep' anarchy, the nihilistic methods
<BR>
must be used as taught in the ChiCom schools. Entice the establishment
<BR>
of powerful police forces and the abuse or negation of civil rights.
<BR>
Atrocities ensue which trigger further rebellion and calls for more
<BR>
fascism. There are key points where events can be interrupted to
<BR>
establish either fascist totalitarianism or anarchy, and the key to
<BR>
which way the population chooses all depends on the propaganda war.
<BR>
<P>This does not necessarily need to mean actual physical violence in the
<BR>
real world. Since more of the economy is moving to the net, cyber
<BR>
terrorism takes on new power, as seen by events in the last few weeks
<BR>
with DoS attacks on prime dot com websites. The problem is figuring out
<BR>
how to entice opressive measures by government over the net. It
<BR>
currently seems that the government is resisting the reprisal/repression
<BR>
urge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to suggest that when we talk of &quot;the State&quot; we are not talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of any entity, either concrete or abstract. I will provide two main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments for this: One from considerations of methodological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individualism, and another that could be called &quot;the argument from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuzziness.&quot; &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot; is the view that results from these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts; it is the idea that we already live in an anarchy.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who looks at the back seat of my Cherokee knows I at least live
<BR>
in one... ;) I'm not so sure about the rest of you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The purpose of the list might be to explore the deepest aspects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of coercive political systems, including the possibility that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current coercive political systems are complete hoaxes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone interested?
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly, so long as it doesn't get inundated by anarchists who are
<BR>
closet socialists (the whole Eugene gang).
