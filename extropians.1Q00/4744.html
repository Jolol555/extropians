<P>
In case the list is already discussing this, let me
<BR>
point out that I'm not &quot;on&quot; the list, because I find
<BR>
it preferable to just skim the archives at
<BR>
www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/date00.html for
<BR>
the useful and interesting posts. The archives are
<BR>
usually posted something like 12 - 24 hours after the
<BR>
fact, so for all I know, somebody has already written
<BR>
about this.
<BR>
<P>That said, I'm surprised that I can't find any
<BR>
reaction to Bill Joy's feature article in the latest
<BR>
Wired magazine. I can't find it on-line yet, but the
<BR>
paper version has hit the racks. It's the cover story,
<BR>
&quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the cover, I expected it to be just another vapid
</EM><BR>
shallow happytalk Wired article, but, to my surprise,
<BR>
it's not. It's very thoughtful, informed, cautionary
<BR>
and foreboding. And, utimately, quite anti-extropian.
<BR>
<P>The article is about the ways that the future of
<BR>
humanity is threatened by what Joy calls the &quot;NGR&quot;
<BR>
technologies (nanotechnology, genetics, and robotics).
<BR>
He compares and contrasts the NGR dangers with the
<BR>
dangers that the &quot;NBC&quot; technologies (nuclear,
<BR>
biological and chemical warfare) have confronted us
<BR>
with for decades, and points out that the NGR techs
<BR>
are more dangerous because it could ultimately become
<BR>
easier for small groups and individuals to make use of
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Joy discusses the &quot;Engines of Destruction&quot; chapter of
<BR>
Drexler's EoC, the &quot;gray goo&quot; problem. He also brings
<BR>
up Frank Herberts novel &quot;The White Plague&quot;, in which a
<BR>
lone scientist tailors a plague to specifically kill
<BR>
people of a particular genetic makeup.
<BR>
<P>Much of what Joy says parallels what Drexler said
<BR>
about &quot;engines of destruction&quot;. However, many on this
<BR>
list will disagree with much of the article, because
<BR>
Joy's attitude towards the end of humanity is that it
<BR>
is something that can and should be prevented. He says
<BR>
we need to start applying common sense and foresite to
<BR>
what technologies we unleash. He goes far; after
<BR>
outlining the central role he has played in the
<BR>
information revolution (for one thing, he invented the
<BR>
Unix editor vi), he says that if he at some time
<BR>
concludes that a certain direction of research
<BR>
endangered the future of humanity, he would feel
<BR>
morally obligated to stop helping it. He draws
<BR>
parallels to the Manhatten Project.
<BR>
<P>Joy's attitude towards the end of humanity is one
<BR>
that, I believe, will be shared by an overwhelming
<BR>
majority of humanity when the issues become more
<BR>
widely-known. A powerful majority.
<BR>
<P>I recommend you read the article.
