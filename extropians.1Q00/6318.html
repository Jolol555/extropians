<EM>&gt; How about this scenario.  Nanoassemblers are developed and the decision is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made to let the public benefit from them.  But in order to be issued a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanobox of your very own, you must first agree to have your every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interaction with any other human, computer or nanodevice recorded and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publicly stored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you have your choice, to be surveilled or not.  Curious: Which would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *you* choose?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is another scenario that is only possible if you already have an
<BR>
authoritarian government - and in this case it has to control the whole
<BR>
world, not just one part of it.
<BR>
<P>In a free society there is no entity that has the power to compel me to sign
<BR>
any particular agreement in order to gain access to nanotech.  I can buy
<BR>
from Zyvex, or Nanotech Industries, or the Japanese, or anyone else who has
<BR>
technology to sell.  The odds of there being a monopoly (or even a small
<BR>
pool of vendors) for very long are just about nil.
<BR>
<P>If you try to get a democratic government to pass a measure like this,
<BR>
you'll just get squashed.  99% of the voters will want nanotech, and 99% of
<BR>
them will oppose mandatory surveillance, so they'll pass one and not the
<BR>
other.  Besides which, the agreement can't be enforced unless you create a
<BR>
police state to do the dirty work - otherwise some people will just sign the
<BR>
agreement and ignore it, others will create a black market in illegal
<BR>
anything boxes, and no one with criminal intent will ever surveil
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line: people do not want strangers watching them in the privacy of
<BR>
their own homes.  The only way to get universal surveillance is to resort to
<BR>
force, and once you do that you've given everyone a very good reason to
<BR>
resist.  In the end, universal surveillance can only happen if there is a
<BR>
police state making it happen, in which case the state will decide who gets
<BR>
watched and who gets to do the watching.
