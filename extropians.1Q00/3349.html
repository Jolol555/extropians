From: Dave Long &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dl@silcom.com?Subject=Re:%20random%20thoughts%20on%20income%20gaps%20and%20the%20mobility%20of%20capital&In-Reply-To=&lt;xxx200002221721.JAA04005@maltesecat&gt;">dl@silcom.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; has fallen faster in poorer countries. Furthermore, evidence exists that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealth creation is a consequence of reduced mortality
</EM><BR>
<P>At least in the US, there's a strong correlation of wealth with age. 
<BR>
The rich are likely to be old, and the young likely to be poor.
<BR>
(this is one reason talking about gaps between &quot;the rich&quot; and &quot;the 
<BR>
poor&quot; can be excessively divisive, if most of the population turns 
<BR>
out to be in both classes at different parts of their lifetimes[1])
<BR>
It may be interesting to figure how much of wealth creation via 
<BR>
mortalitity reduction is due to accumulation over longer periods.
<BR>
(with family trusts, we may even have data on entities that span 
<BR>
several lifetimes)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; startups in India in the last six months, capital flowing in, and if only the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Indian government would relax rules that say all Indian companeis must be at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least 72% owned domestically, we'd be moving half our activity there...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be splitting hairs, but I'd make the following distinction, 
<BR>
based on where the capital accumulates:
<BR>
<P>If I can take my capital, and move to India, Sri Lanka, Switzerland,
<BR>
or some other such place, then it's truly mobile capital.  On the other
<BR>
hand, if I stay home yet retain full ownership of an Indian concern,
<BR>
then in all fairness, it should be considered stationary capital.
<BR>
<P>Of course, if the Indian concern then defaults (apparently a common 
<BR>
occurence for foreign investment in the US in prior centuries), I'd 
<BR>
be willing to count whatever development was still useful as capital 
<BR>
which had moved[2].  
<BR>
<P>-Dave
<BR>
<P>[1] yet another reason, according to the 1998 Consumer Expenditure 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey, is that there is a clear correlation between quintile and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average number of earners in a consumer unit: from .7 earners in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lowest quintile, through 1.3 in the third, to 2.1 in the top 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quintile.  Number of earners isn't the whole story though: there 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a fourteen-fold difference between the average income of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumer units in the top and bottom quintiles; a three-fold 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difference in number of earners leaves a 4.6-fold difference for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other factors. [note also that these are income quintiles, not 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wealth quintiles]
<BR>
<P>[2] I'm curious to see who will make use of the vacant AutoNation on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the local freeway, and how.  Out in the desert, I notice that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land and construction is cheap enough that they don't reuse old
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locations -- why bother, when one can just throw up new boxes?
