<EM>&gt; &gt;  From today's &quot;Salon&quot; newsfeed:

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The right stuff for the Red Planet: At 35, Dava Newman's an MIT engineer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people promoting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place due to it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity? Don't get me wrong I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us to go there and I feel we could live there. I believe, though, we can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live there under a man made roof to hold in the atmosphere. I asked R. Zubrin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this question. All he said was go read his book. Geez, was a straight answer so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult? Perhaps he's only in it for the money as he was more interested in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buying his book than answering a question that couldn't have taken but a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, Mars would tend to lose its atmosphere, but the time constant is on
<BR>
the order of thirty million years.  Once you get it set up, the next
<BR>
preventative maintenance visit could be scheduled for oh, sometime in
<BR>
the next ten million years.
<BR>
<P>Also, an oxygen bearing atmosphere would not lose hydrogen at a high
<BR>
rate- it would form an ozone layer, creating a stratospheric cold trap
<BR>
which keeps the water vapor below.  With no water reaching the
<BR>
ionosphere, no photolysis and hydrogen loss occurs.
<BR>
<P>Megayear vistas don't make much sense with the Singularity bearing down
<BR>
upon us...
