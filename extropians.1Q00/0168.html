<P><EM>&gt;Well, the original writings were for the most part set down during their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own lifetimes by those who had been in personal contact with Jesus or if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not were nearly contemporary with Jesus and among the earliest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Christians.  So the New Testament is for the most part not purported to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be multi-level hearsay.  
</EM><BR>
<P>The Gospels were definitely multi-level hearsay.  Matthew, Mark, and 
<BR>
Luke were written in Greek and based on at least two different 
<BR>
documents previously written in Aramaic and later translated.  Hence
<BR>
they are at least two steps removed.  John was written even later
<BR>
and at least parts of Acts were written by the author of Luke.
<BR>
The authors make a couple of telling translation and geography
<BR>
errors, like the &quot;camel through a needle's eye&quot; business (&quot;rope&quot;
<BR>
in the original Aramaic.)
<BR>
<P>Some of the purportedly apostolic letters, like James, 1 Peter,
<BR>
and 1 John *could* have been written by the purported authors.
<BR>
Some of them, such as 2 Peter, are either fakes or extensively
<BR>
redacted.  In general, however, the parts of the New Testament
<BR>
which aren't demonstrably hearsay are precisely those which say
<BR>
the least about Jesus.
<BR>
<P>I personally suspect the New Testament was a compilation of un-
<BR>
related stories.  The story of Jesus could originate from some
<BR>
cult leader who was crucified but not killed.  According to the
<BR>
Gospels, the Romans didn't actually want to kill him and the
<BR>
crucifixion as described wouldn't have actually killed anybody
<BR>
(it takes days).  Some of Matthew and Luke appear to come from
<BR>
the Krishna myth (virgin birth, 3 Magi, flight to Egypt).  So
<BR>
my hypothesis is that the initial story was somebody who survived 
<BR>
a crucifixion, to which various other stories were accreted
<BR>
in the retellings and translations.
