<EM>&gt;&gt; Drug use threatens the ruling class, which itself remains immured in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; existential angst
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've heard this argument from conspiracy thrown around lightly a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deal over the years; I have yet to hear any particular justification why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is the case.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe it has anything to do with conspiracy. It follows from the fact
<BR>
that by definition, the ruling class wants to rule. It can't rule unruly
<BR>
subjects. Hence, it severely punishes instances of unruliness, including the
<BR>
taking of drugs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As far as I can tell, drug use DOESN'T threaten the ruling class in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way at all.  When people take it upon themselves to break laws, THAT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;threatens the ruling class, and thus drug users do threaten government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wherever drug use is illegal, but that's not a justification for any kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of conspiracy to MAKE it illegal.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess that depends on the particular ruling class in question. If you want to
<BR>
test the theory, try doing drugs in Turkey and see what the Turkish ruling class
<BR>
does to you. (Hope you like being hung upside down while someone beats the soles
<BR>
of your feet.) I don't believe conspiracy has much to do with it. You jump to
<BR>
conclusions when you mention conspiracy theories from what I've posted on this
<BR>
thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Indeed, if anything, &quot;opiating&quot; the masses seems like EXACTLY the sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing we'd expect a totalitarain government to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>That explains why the ruling class supports _prescription_ drugs as opposed to
<BR>
self-administered and self-procured drugs. This element of the overall situation
<BR>
does become important.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You might argue that the Government is acting foolishly, then, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it's covering its own backside by outlawing drug use.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find it amusing that the idea of opposition to drugs by the ruling class would
<BR>
elicit such responses. Sounds like you have an axe to grind here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Am I missing something big here?
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you miss that joint?
