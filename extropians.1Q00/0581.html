<EM>&gt;These are the common responses I tend to hear to explain the WOD from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the non-party line point of view, but I don't buy them much. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;longing to transcend existential angst makes people take drugs, why do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they not start to meditate?
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you know that they do not start to meditate? You may not hear from them
<BR>
again if they do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If drug use threatens the ruling class,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shouldn't we see a war on printing/internet too?
</EM><BR>
<P>As if we don't. As if we haven't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(not just a dislike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for &quot;yellow press&quot; or moral panics about child porn but a serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concerted attempt to get rid of the evil stuff). If the ruling class
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was so upset about people finding ways out of existential angst, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are they not cracking down on religions and comedy?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe the ruling class considers the people capable of finding ways
<BR>
out of existential angst. After all, the ruling class has failed to find such a
<BR>
way, and it considers its own capabilities superior to those it rules.
<BR>
&quot;religions and comedy&quot;? The ruling class makes a distinction here? &lt;sneer&gt;
<BR>
Remember Waco? Remember McCarthyism? Crack downs continue, but perhaps you
<BR>
haven't felt the impact yet in Sweden.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think we need to think a bit more carefully about the problem than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spouting what is essentially the &quot;non-conformist party line&quot; (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;above claims can be found practically verbatim in the writings of RAW,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Leary et al). After all, as transhumanists we need good arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ourselves as well as an understanding of why people act the way they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't read RAW or Leary, so thanks for the heads up on why I should not start.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Existential angst is really just the idea that ordinary life has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;negative emotional valence - which doesn't seem to hold true in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;general. People have a large variability in emotional states and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personalities. I actually laughed aloud when I read Sartre, and he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;claimed that people who did not feel existential angst actually were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;repressing it. My personal theory is that much of existentialism was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;founded by people who would have benefited from prozac :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we need to think a bit more carefully about defining what existential
<BR>
angst means to others before spouting simplistic definitions. Existential angst
<BR>
can mean more than just the idea that ordinary life has a negative emotional
<BR>
valence. For example, it implies that people need to abandon outmoded religious
<BR>
traditions which many hold dear. Sartre does write in a laughable style, and
<BR>
translations from the French make his style even more comical. Nevertheless it
<BR>
seems probable to me that some people do indeed repress existential angst. In
<BR>
addition, many people repress their longing for release from this angst.
<BR>
Prozac... just another drug, albeit a legal one (if properly prescribed by a
<BR>
physician).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A more likely set of reasons for people taking drugs is a combination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of pleasure- or novelty-seeking, peer pressure, cultural conditioning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as well as (conscious or unconscious) self-medication. Then what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens of course dependens on the interaction of the drug, person and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment, the outcomes can be quite variable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, many thrill seekers may in fact take drugs for fun. But you apparently
<BR>
missed the point of the original question about the type of people mentioned.
<BR>
Not the type of thrill seeker you describe. And yes, set and setting matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, the attempt to suppress drugs is an interesting social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phenomenon. I have no doubt that there are people much more in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know about the history of drug legality worldwide, but overall it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems that banning drugs as substances of abuse was something that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occured relatively recently, in the 30's and 40's if I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minsremember. Of course alcohol has a longer legal history but may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fall under other sociopolitical forces, as did opium during the opium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;war (where banning it was very much a statement about foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policy).
</EM><BR>
<P>It is more than an &quot;attempt&quot; to suppress drugs. Two million prisoners in the US
<BR>
(half of which are there because of drug-related offenses) says that it is more
<BR>
than an attempt. It is a fact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What was the reasons for the bans? I think (here the historians might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help) that concerns about public health was the major official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason. Before this time, public health was a problem that was too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hard to deal with, but at this time it appeared more and more possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it could be fixed by a benevolent state and hence that it should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be fixed; hence the anti-drug stance previously taken mainly by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smaller organisations could now be implemented nationwide.
</EM><BR>
<P>Drugs were not as much of a problem in earlier times perhaps because people did
<BR>
not have as much access, because people did not want them as much (not enough
<BR>
existential angst) and because the penalties were more severe. Public health was
<BR>
not the motive, except as public health converged with control of the public,
<BR>
and making the public productive units for the ruling class.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Hmm, got a bit longer than I intended. My flu seems still to affect my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writing inhibitions, making them somewhat erratic (I answer some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;posts, but maybe not the ones I ought to answer). Interesting. Worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing a study on...
</EM><BR>
<P>Take some drugs for your flu symptoms, Anders.
<BR>
Get well soon.
<BR>
<P><P>Cheers,
<BR>
