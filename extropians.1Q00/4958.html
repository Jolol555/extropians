<EM>&gt; Regarding the current gun debate and all previous incarnations, why bother?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aside from venting -- which, in itself is counterproductive; people who vent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only vent again; they don't move to some new equilibrium -- do any of you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really think you're going to persuade someone on this list?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point, however people _do_ change their attitude over time.
<BR>
<P>I'm considerably more skeptical about the claims of gun control advocates
<BR>
than I was a couple of years ago, mostly as a result of intermittently
<BR>
stumbling over the permanent floating usenet gun control thread and
<BR>
engaging in _illuminating_ discourse with anti-gun-control people. (Not
<BR>
flamage, you'll note. Gratuitous insults and flaming discredits the
<BR>
flamer.)
<BR>
<P>My attitude probably doesn't make any practical difference to anything
<BR>
-- I live in the UK and have never seen a real, working handgun in this
<BR>
country outside of a museum or an airport departure lounge -- but it
<BR>
might make some of the pro-gun-ownership people a little happier to know
<BR>
that some of the people they're debating with can learn from the debate,
<BR>
and will shift their stance over time if confronted with enough evidence.
<BR>
<P>For my part, I believe gun control in the UK is a classic example of
<BR>
a moral panic being coopted by legislators for reasons of short-term
<BR>
political gain. The real point of interest is why the USA has so many
<BR>
people with low inhibitions against committing acts of violence against
<BR>
their neighbours -- and why discussion of the underlying sociological
<BR>
phenomenon seems to be taboo. (What kills people is other people with no
<BR>
psychological restraint on their actions; never mind access to weapons,
<BR>
if they can't get guns they'll use knives, or cars, or whatever comes 
<BR>
to hand. The burning question is _why_.)
<BR>
<P>I could make the same point about the abortion debate; here in the UK
<BR>
only the religious fringe pay it any attention, and the vast majority
<BR>
of the population don't want or perceive a need for any change in the
<BR>
current law, which is basically abortion-on-demand up to 22 weeks. (In
<BR>
fact, last time the religious right tried to ram through a parliamentary
<BR>
act tightening up controls on abortion, the staged vote and tabled
<BR>
amendments ended up _relaxing_ the law. Heh.)
