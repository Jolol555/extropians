<EM>&gt; Ok Mike, if that is the case, what can we do to Network Solutions

<EM>&gt; to convince them that treating people the way they do (like they

<EM>&gt; &quot;own&quot; the domain names), will in the long run come back to bite them.

<P>The only way to fight that fight is with money. Assuming you have gobs
<BR>
and gobs of it, you start your own domain name registration service, and
<BR>
get ICANN, or WIPO or whoever it is now that oversees and approves new
<BR>
domain name registry services to let you get into the business. Possibly
<BR>
create your own new top level domains (rather than .com .net .web, etc.
<BR>
use .sys, .inc, .corp, .home, etc....) Once you have done this, sell
<BR>
your domain names as if they are property, i.e. no annual fees, just a
<BR>
one time purchase. The problem with Network Solutions is the same
<BR>
problem many wester states have with the federal government. After the
<BR>
midwest was sold off and homesteaded, the feds got wise to this and said
<BR>
to those wanting to settle the rockymountain and sierra nevada/cascades
<BR>
states: ok, you aren't going to be able to buy this land, but you can
<BR>
lease the rights to it. THis is why so much of the land in the 11
<BR>
western states is still federally owned. Network Solutions is treating
<BR>
domain names the same way. They treat you  like you don't own that
<BR>
domain, because you really DONT own that domain, you are merely leasing
<BR>
it for a year. The name space below top level domains is essentially a
<BR>
mass of virtual real estate. Whoever controls the top level domain is
<BR>
the sovereign, is the master land lord. If you sell off the domain names
<BR>
under your top level domain permanently with no annual fees, then you
<BR>
have acheived your goals.
