<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote about the Landis Tsiolkovsky Tower design paper in JBIS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I htmlized it... See:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   <A HREF="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Landis-GA/TTTR.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Landis-GA/TTTR.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and pointers from that.  Geoffrey Landis is a very serious engineer, so...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert, I got to the same point Landis did in my 1993 paper.  I will snail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mail you a copy if you wish, or better yet, I will scan and email it.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived the formula for the cross sectional area in terms of altitude, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could not integrate, for the expression is quite complicated.  I did the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same thing Landis did: numerical integration.  {8-[    I used excel for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, a fellow abuser of excel.  I've even used it to calculate iengine
<BR>
injector layouts and their mass flow distributions, via some ugly
<BR>
thresholding functions and indirect referencing.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder if anyone has managed to perform that integral and get a closed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form solution for the mass of a skyhook in terms of specific strength of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the material and the mass and rotation rate of the planet about which it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbits.  Have you heard of such a solution?  That paper was shortly before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the web changed everything.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could have sworn that Moravec did that, but damn if I can remember the
<BR>
ref.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; When I did my paper, I mentioned spider silk, but not diamond.  I didnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a theoretical tensile strength of diamond.  Do you have that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Skyhooks and the tensile strength of various materials were discussed in
<BR>
sci.space.policy and/or tech in the last month- you might try a Daja
<BR>
search.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Also, I think someone mentioned a isosynchronous cable on Mars.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concluded in 1993 that it is faaar more feasible there than on Earth. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, I looked at skyhooks attached to Phobos, too- it's the obvious
<BR>
source for materials, and is a mighty momentum bank.  Trolling the hook
<BR>
through the upper atmosphere of Mars at 252 m/s turns out to be right
<BR>
around mach one in cold CO2. The upper branch of the tther can terminate
<BR>
well below Deimos and still throw objects at far beyond escape velocity-
<BR>
no &quot;jumprope&quot; problem as with an aresynchronous tether.
<BR>
<P>The electrical supply for the lower end of the tether is provided by
<BR>
transonic windmills...
