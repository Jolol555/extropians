<P><EM>&gt; Definitions aren't knowledge, and arguments about definitions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masturbation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Arguments about definitions occur all the time in rational inquiry.  In
<BR>
order to possess a practical understanding of ornithological ecology bare
<BR>
names are certainly not enough (or even, as you imply, ultimately
<BR>
necessary).  We argue over definitions because they do or at least should
<BR>
contain knowledge; in fact, they sometimes represent fundamental bits of
<BR>
knowledge within some science.  We might say, for example, that our
<BR>
understanding of the nature of light is represented in a definition of
<BR>
light.  And if we cannot agree on the names of things our discourse will fail.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;The Millennium&quot; isn't a thing, it's just the name of a thing.  An arbitrary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human convention utterly without real substance, and beneath the dignity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational argument.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, &quot;The Millennium&quot; is a name.  And the Millennium is also a thing,
<BR>
namely (in
<BR>
this case), the third millennium of the Gregorian calendar.  The name is
<BR>
properly attached to the thing; people are just wrong about the status of the
<BR>
thing.  My criticism was not about whether or not the turn of the millennium
<BR>
(and century and decade) was worthy enough about which to argue but mainly why
<BR>
people abandon these relationships between things.
<BR>
<P>It is perfectly legitimate to question the acceptance or validity of a
<BR>
convention.  How is a convention not something of real substance?  As I said in
<BR>
my first note, social facts, however ephemeral or uninteresting, still exist as
<BR>
memes in real people's heads.
