<EM>&gt; &gt;Since there are more people in the US than guns, then it is hardly a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of fact. Since there are more people in the world than guns in the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;also not a statement of fact. A statement of fact would be,&quot;an organization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fights to maintain every law abiding American's right to own as many or as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;guns as they wish.&quot; That would be a statement of fact as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;non-inflammatory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recall reading something that said there are more guns in the US than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.  That was why I made the statement.  However, if I am wrong about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, I am not ashamed to admit it.  Do you know where the number of guns in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circulation can be found?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have a citation, however, the highest reliable estimate that I
<BR>
have ever heard, which includes all antique guns dating back to the
<BR>
Civil and Revolutionary Wars that are still in existence, which may or
<BR>
may not be in functional condition (hardly useful for causing mayhem,
<BR>
eh?), is approximately 240 million. The UN Committee on the Control of
<BR>
Small Arms has recently estimated that there are approximately 800
<BR>
million small arms in the world.
<BR>
<P>What you have heard here on the list is that there are more guns than
<BR>
automobiles in the US. I know it because I said it, and I backed it up.
