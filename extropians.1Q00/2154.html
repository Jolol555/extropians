The Rob(xx) vs Rob(xxx) Debate
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here are the questions to ask:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; While HIV may be the scourge now, clearly in the '50's Polio was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; something that caused a great deal of harm.  A brief glance at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fields Virology indicates that in the early '50's, Polio was paralyzing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 10-30,000 people a year.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;...Polio vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1955. During
<BR>
1951-1954, an average of 16,316 paralytic polio cases and 1879 deaths from
<BR>
polio were reported each year (9,10). Polio incidence declined sharply
<BR>
following the introduction of vaccine to &lt;1000 cases in 1962 and remained
<BR>
below 100 cases after that year. In 1994, every dollar spent to administer
<BR>
oral poliovirus vaccine saved $3.40 in direct medical costs and $2.74 in
<BR>
indirect societal costs&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/arttop10a.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/arttop10a.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The US polio death rate was ~1/500 of the total US death rate when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the vaccine was introduced.  Not a negligible factor, but surely much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller than many other influences on health.  And the other vaccines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had even smaller effects on total mortality.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Every year, up to three million children's lives are saved by immunization.
<BR>
But almost three million more lives worldwide are lost from diseases that
<BR>
are preventable with existing vaccines. &quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.vaccinealliance.org/">http://www.vaccinealliance.org/</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I think you can attribute modern health to three things: (1) sanitation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (2) antibiotics, and (3) vaccines.   ... A fourth factor is the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understanding of germ theory and communicability and getting medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practitioners to follow practices that minimized transmission.  But
</EM><BR>
these
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; factors combined are what has extended average longevity from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ~30-40 years to ~75 years.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is completely wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Future Direction
<BR>
Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of biomedical science and
<BR>
public health. Despite remarkable progress, several challenges face the...&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/arttop10a.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/arttop10a.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>&quot;The two public health interventions that have had the greatest impact on
<BR>
the world's health  clean water and vaccines. Thanks to such pioneers as
<BR>
Jenner and Pasteur, a handful of vaccines prevent illness or death for
<BR>
millions of individuals every year.  But there is still a long way to go.
<BR>
Immunization, the most cost-effective public health intervention,  continues
<BR>
to be under-used.. It is profoundly tragic that almost two million children
<BR>
still die each year from diseases for which are available at low cost . And
<BR>
over 90 000 fall victim to paralytic polio, which could also have been
<BR>
prevented by immunization.&quot;

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Medicine overall seems to have very little effect on health.  This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usual answer from statistical analyses, and from the few controlled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments we have.
</EM><BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.who.int/gpv-surv/graphics/Jan99graphics/estdeaths.htm">http://www.who.int/gpv-surv/graphics/Jan99graphics/estdeaths.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The mortality rates of most diseases treated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antibiotics didn't change noticeably upon the introduction of that
</EM><BR>
treatment.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think we have controlled experiments regarding sanitation, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistical analyses we do have don't show any effect of sanitation on
</EM><BR>
health.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd guess that Medicine of all forms probably contributes less than 1 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that 40 year increase in lifespan.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Deaths from infectious diseases have declined markedly in the United States
<BR>
during the 20th century (Figure 1). This decline contributed to a sharp drop
<BR>
in infant and child mortality (1,2) and to the 29.2-year increase in life
<BR>
expectancy&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1">http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since sanitation also doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that important, it is a big puzzle why exactly lifespan has increased so.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Sanitation and Hygiene
<BR>
The 19th century shift in population from country to city that accompanied
<BR>
industrialization and immigration led to overcrowding in poor housing served
<BR>
by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies and waste-disposal
<BR>
systems. These conditions resulted in repeated outbreaks of cholera,
<BR>
dysentery, TB, typhoid fever, influenza, yellow fever, and malaria.
<BR>
By 1900, however, the incidence of many of these diseases had begun to
<BR>
decline because of public health improvements, implementation of which
<BR>
continued into the 20th century. Local, state, and federal efforts to
<BR>
improve sanitation and hygiene reinforced the concept of collective &quot;public
<BR>
health&quot; action (e.g., to prevent infection by providing clean drinking
<BR>
water). By 1900, 40 of the 45 states had established health departments. The
<BR>
first county health departments were established in 1908 (6). From the 1930s
<BR>
through the 1950s, state and local health departments made substantial
<BR>
progress in disease prevention activities, including sewage disposal, water
<BR>
treatment, food safety, organized solid waste disposal, and public education
<BR>
about hygienic practices (e.g., foodhandling and handwashing). Chlorination
<BR>
and other treatments of drinking water began in the early 1900s and became
<BR>
widespread public health practices, further decreasing the incidence of
<BR>
waterborne diseases. The incidence of TB also declined as improvements in
<BR>
housing reduced crowding and TB-control programs were initiated. In 1900,
<BR>
194 of every 100,000 U.S. residents died from TB; most were residents of
<BR>
urban areas. In 1940 (before the introduction of antibiotic therapy), TB
<BR>
remained a leading cause of death, but the crude death rate had decreased to
<BR>
46 per 100,000 persons (7).
<BR>
Animal and pest control also contributed to disease reduction. Nationally
<BR>
sponsored, state-coordinated vaccination and animal-control programs
<BR>
eliminated dog-to-dog transmission of rabies. Malaria, once endemic
<BR>
throughout the southeastern United States, was reduced to negligible levels
<BR>
by the late 1940s; regional mosquito-control programs played an important
<BR>
role in these efforts. Plague also diminished; the U.S. Marine Hospital
<BR>
Service (which later became the Public Health Service) led quarantine and
<BR>
ship inspection activities and rodent and vector-control operations. The
<BR>
last major rat-associated outbreak of plague in the United States occurred
<BR>
during 1924-1925 in Los Angeles. This outbreak included the last identified
<BR>
instance of human-to-human transmission of plague (through inhalation of
<BR>
infectious respiratory droplets from coughing patients) in this country.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is also a puzzle why the US spends 14% of GDP on medicine.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Cost-Effectiveness of Immunization: Immunization is the most cost-effective
<BR>
health measure. It is also an essential component in a nation's efforts to
<BR>
boost economic development and reduce poverty. Even if the cost of a routine
<BR>
immunization program incorporating new vaccines were to reach US$2 billion
<BR>
per year to reach out to all children in low income countries, that would
<BR>
still represent only about US$0.35 for every person on earth and less than
<BR>
0.1% of what the world spends on health.&quot;

<P>&quot;The Impact of Immunization on Economic Development &quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.vaccinealliance.org/press/press_econ.html">http://www.vaccinealliance.org/press/press_econ.html</A>
<BR>
<P>On Jan 31,2000 the Children's Challenge was launched at the World Economic
<BR>
Forum in Switzerland.  The Challenge: &quot;Immunize every child, protect the
<BR>
future.&quot; Sponsored by GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
<BR>
Immunizations...(World Health Organization, The World Bank, UNICEF, The
<BR>
Rockefeller Foundation, etc.)
<BR>
<P>So, we appear to be gaining in the M&amp;M via micro-organism and succumbing to
<BR>
host-induced M&amp;M.
