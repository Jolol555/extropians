<P>
At the risk of pouring gasoline on a bonfire, I feel I should point out a
<BR>
couple of real-world considerations that seem to be getting ignored in this
<BR>
debate.
<BR>
<P>Any attempt to create a universal surveillance system faces a very
<BR>
fundamental problem having nothing to do with technology: a majority of the
<BR>
population will refuse to support such a system.  Very few people would
<BR>
consent to set up permanent public surveillance of their own bedroom,
<BR>
bathroom, or other private spaces, and surveillance of corporate property
<BR>
will also run into strong opposition.  Needless to say, no one who has
<BR>
anything to hide will go along with the idea either, and the fraction of the
<BR>
population with something to hide is fairly large even in modern
<BR>
democracies.
<BR>
<P>In order to build a universal system, then, you need a government willing to
<BR>
ignore the wishes of a majority of the population and install a surveillance
<BR>
system at gunpoint.  It order to prevent civil disobedience from rendering
<BR>
the system ineffective, it must also be willing to criminalize privacy and
<BR>
impose draconian penalties on anyone who attempts to avoid surveillance.
<BR>
The resulting struggle will be at least as bad as America's current drug
<BR>
war, and the ultimate results are equally uncertain.
<BR>
<P>Historically, governments usually succeed at this kind of unpopular effort
<BR>
only if they are willing and able to adopt very authoritarian approaches to
<BR>
crime fighting.  Essentially they have to dispense with the niceties of a
<BR>
criminal justice system and simply shoot everyone they suspect of having
<BR>
anything to do with the resistance.  Then the population either rebels, or
<BR>
is eventually cowed into submission.
<BR>
<P>Now, Zero, can you se why no one trusts that the system would actually
<BR>
benefit anyone?  You can't have universal public-access surveillance unless
<BR>
you already have an authoritarian government to force everyone to
<BR>
participate, and if you've got an authoritarian government it isn't going to
<BR>
let ordinary citizens see anything it doesn't want them to.
<BR>
<P>There are only a few kinds of surveillance that avoid this problem.  If you
<BR>
want everything to be voluntary, you can either have:
<BR>
<P>1) Private Personal Surveillance - everyone carries a camera around and
<BR>
records his/her own life, and everyone has surveillance inside their own
<BR>
home.  However, you can't compel someone else to hand over their tapes
<BR>
(except possibly as evidence in a trial).  This gives you most of the
<BR>
crime-fighting benefits of transparency, but nothing else.  In particular,
<BR>
the fact that records can be erased and/or edited means you will never have
<BR>
an infallible public record of events.
<BR>
<P>2) Public State Surveillance - you might get a majority of the population to
<BR>
endorse publicly-funded surveillance of public areas in populated regions.
<BR>
However, getting them to make the recordings public is going to be an uphill
<BR>
battle, because you are fighting against the entrenched self-interest of the
<BR>
bureaucrats.  In any event, this is far cry from a transparent society,
<BR>
because all the nasty business you would really like to catch will simply be
<BR>
conducted outside the reach of the cameras.  All the system really does is
<BR>
reduce street crime a bit.
<BR>
<P>If there is another option that can be implemented without first becoming an
<BR>
authoritarian state I don't see it.
