Here was a comment about StockGeneration from another mailing list, in
<BR>
reference to a similar operation being started in a few weeks:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The game is to be modeled after StockGeneration. StockGeneration was set up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a form which would be a legitimate gambling operation IF they played by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own rules, set up a reserve cash pool to cover the share prices of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their stock, and readjusted the price of the stocks each day as people buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and sell them, to keep their total pool reserves at the same percentage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total stock capitalization. HOWEVER, in 2 years, they've never dropped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price of their largest, and, by far, most popular stocks, and so their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liabilities have grown FAR in excess of their assets and now they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delaying withdrawals by 4 months, and putting several restrictions on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; withdrawals. StockGeneration is now crashing as a ponzi scheme.
</EM><BR>
<P>As people here noted, Ponzi schemes always end up crashing - usually just
<BR>
after YOU are invited to join (so you're the one who ends up holding the
<BR>
bag).
