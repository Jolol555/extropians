<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  BTW, I live in Hong Kong, where companies have much more freedom to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  than in the US and take full advantage of it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Consider that it may have less to do with the level of government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; than it does with the quality of general civic consciousness in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; culture or region.  Common expectations of civil behavior may have as 
</EM><BR>
much 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; do with how individuals AND institutions (governmental and business) act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; toward both public and private goods than explicit law or regulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No doubt, but we have little control over people's attitudes as a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  public policy.  Yes, the HK gov't has tried for years to convince people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  keeping the city clean would be better for everyone, but...
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be because those exhortations &quot;fall on deaf ears&quot; in the sense that 
<BR>
they don't call on basic values and memes in the majority culture.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Also, I doubt that expectations of civic behavior significantly deter the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  serious polluters (big oil companies?) when profits are at stake.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I think they do, but not in the way one might think.  At a minimum, 
<BR>
such expectations cause the &quot;serious polluters&quot; to whom you refer to do so as 
<BR>
surreptitiously as possible, and to clothe their activity in &quot;propaganda&quot; 
<BR>
that calls on the mainstream culture's expectations of civic behavior.  Thus 
<BR>
companies in the US invest a huge amount of money in &quot;environmental PR&quot; and 
<BR>
even REAL conservation efforts, while they may also at the same time be 
<BR>
engaging in environmentally harmful behavior behind the scenes, so to speak.  
<BR>
Furthermore, corporations ARE made up of people and there are internal 
<BR>
dynamics that oppose environmentally harmful activities, ranging from R&amp;D 
<BR>
aimed at developing lower-impact technologies to &quot;whistelblowers&quot;. Finally, 
<BR>
and crucially important in the Anglo-American world, pollution ultimately 
<BR>
runs up against the private rights of individuals which begin to exert a 
<BR>
reforming pressure through the tort system. The activities of polluters in 
<BR>
cultures that have a different conception of civic behavior aren't so 
<BR>
constrained.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I used to live in Tokyo, BTW, and while the streets *are* a lot cleaner 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than in HK because of Japanese cultural attitudes towards hygiene, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that the industrial pollution was almost as bad as in south China today 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the gov't started cleaning it up.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's certainly right, as it was in the Euro-American-Antipodean world as 
<BR>
well.  But perhaps the significant factor here is that the governments AND 
<BR>
nongovernmental efforts in the latter &quot;memesphere&quot; DID act to curb 
<BR>
environmental degradation - as a response to and expression of basic values 
<BR>
within the cultures out of which they arose.
<BR>
<P>FYI, my thinking along these lines is influenced by the recent work of 
<BR>
Francis Fukuyama, especially his most recent book, &quot;Trust&quot;, which I highly 
<BR>
recommend.
