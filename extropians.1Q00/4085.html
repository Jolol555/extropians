<P>Ebola, one of the most terrifying diseases in the world, could be treatable 
<BR>
according to a new study. 
<BR>
<P>The research, done on mice in the US, even suggests that an effective vaccine 
<BR>
could be developed in the future. 
<BR>
<P>Ebola viruses cause catastrophic internal bleeding in infected humans. The 
<BR>
disease is nearly always fatal and no vaccines or treatments currently exist. 
<BR>
<P><P><P>Several lethal strains
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
However, the scientific team, led by Mary Kate Hart at the US Army Medical 
<BR>
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland, has discovered a 
<BR>
promising approach. 
<BR>
<P>They managed to produce antibodies to the virus in laboratory mice. These 
<BR>
antibodies were then removed and replicated. 
<BR>
<P>A second set of mice was injected with the antibodies, both before and after 
<BR>
being injected with Ebola - many of them survived, despite receiving 300 
<BR>
times the lethal dose. 
<BR>
<P>The antibodies were administered a day before or after infection, which 
<BR>
normally kills within a week. Most of the mice lived for at least 28 days. 
<BR>
<P>New hope 
<BR>
<P>There are several lethal strains of the Ebola virus but the disabling 
<BR>
antibodies attach to a part of the virus common to all of them. 
<BR>
<P>Previous studies had suggested that antibodies did not help protect from 
<BR>
Ebola, but this new work shows that there is hope. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;These results suggest that it is possible to elicit by vaccination, or 
<BR>
produce for therapeutic use, antibodies protective against all Ebola viruses 
<BR>
that are pathogenic for humans,&quot; the team conclude, in the journal Science.
