<P>OK, fine !  Be it so.  I can live with being called a justificationalist. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Make up a new word for this concept or call them &quot;survivors.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, that would seem to be a fine solution.  I like this &quot;survivors&quot; 
<BR>
terminology !!  It is nonsense to say that a theory is 'true' or 'false', one 
<BR>
should say that the theory is a 'survivor' or 'non-survivor' meme.  Nice !! 
<BR>

<P>&gt; that sounds pessimistic BUT WAIT . . .  THAT MEANS justification is not 
&gt; needed to get helpful theories!  That _is_ Dynamically Optimistic!  
<P>I agree that it would be nice to get along with as simple and sparse a tool 
set as possible.  I agree that IF it were possible to do without 
justificationalism, that this would be good, and that this would be an advance 
of science; and that IF justificationalism were unnecessary it would therefore 
be a D.O. thing to junk justificationalism.  But you did *not* explain here 
*why* justificationalism is unnecessary, you only quoted authorities who say 
so.  
<P>Again thanking you for your literature pointers, I however suspect I would 
disagree with those non-justificationalist authorities you quote just as much 
as I disagree with you, because having read some things by Popper who you say 
is an non-justificationalist, I still don't seem to get the message.  (Reading 
the justificationalist writers you quote would not help either, because I 
would agree with them anyway.)  Since I'm not on a mailing list with any of 
those authorities but am on a mailing list with you, I'm trying to use direct 
conversation with you as a means to uncover some wisdom on this subject. 
<P>Can you explain to me please, WITHOUT using referral to 'authorities' as your 
only arguments, exactly WHY using positive/supportive proof is unnecessary and 
maybe even wrong/bad ?  If it is so obvious to you that justificationalism is 
wrong, then that should mean that it should also be easy for you to explain 
why.  E.g., can you explain with the use of a simple example from everyday 
life ? 
<P>&gt; but empirical tests (controlled experiments) that weed 
&gt; out the errors and therefore find the surviving and helpful theories _are_ 
&gt; worthwhile.
<P>Again, I fully agree that criticizing *is* necessary and useful !!  But I 
still don't see how it might be possible to do science with criticism as your 
*only* tool -- i.e., without using also sometimes more constructive tools. 
<P>How do you invent the candidate theories with which you start out in the 1st 
place ?  Criticizing (in your sense of the term) does not seem to be a tool 
that can be used to invent those new candidate theories.  
<P>Best greetings,   Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Justificationalism%20(Was:%20Dynamic%20Optimism%20as%20a%20tool%20in%20logical%20reasoning)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000116155411.1035A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
