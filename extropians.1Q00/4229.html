Funny how the theoretical becomes of such immediate practical concern when 
<BR>
all the things you don't consider valuable about life in academic 
<BR>
discussions are about to be taken away from you, and just MAYBE for forever. 
<BR>
You'll just have to take my word for it on this one: I've seen it all to 
<BR>
often.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Sobering words for all of us.  I can understand how someone in the trenches 
<BR>
of cryonics research who has spent their adult life working for various 
<BR>
cryonics organizations would have this perspective.  I bet you have seen 
<BR>
some very frightened and worried people over the years!  If possible could 
<BR>
you share any of these experiences with us?  Both sad and inspiring?
<BR>
<P>Are there going to be any fundraising efforts for improved suspension 
<BR>
techniques that we could rally around?  I have heard that Saul Kent is 
<BR>
planning a new intitiative in the near future.  How much money would need to 
<BR>
be raised?  What level of breakthroughs could be hoped for if it were?
<BR>
<P>I want to say thank you for posting on the list such an important message.  
<BR>
I hope we hear from you again.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
