<EM>&gt; &gt; The question is of dubious relevance anyway; the militia movement is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and never was monolithic.  It may well include racists; it also includes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Blacks (like the spokesman for a prominent Ohio group) and Jews (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  most of the San Diego group, or so it was said some years ago).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Comming from Ohio, I know who you mean (the fellow who testified before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; House of Representatives)and I believe left the org because of Klan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infiltration, among other reasons.  Did ya know that after Butler goes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that big Klan Rally in the sky, Aryan Nations is considering a move here?
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean the rally where the crosses won't be the only things burning for
<BR>
eternity?
<BR>
<P>Considering the apparent popularity of charismatic type religious revival
<BR>
preachers in Ohio (and the wide spread belief in things like 'speaking in
<BR>
tongues' etc. there), I'm not too surprised.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you accept the data gathered by the Southern Poverty Law Center? Too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Leftist for ya? Academics? Defamation League? Funny thing is, I am frequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubtful about what the government does simply because its dominated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-serving lawyers-everyone has hit Law school, if not passed their bar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exam.  So when a prosecuter says something, I scrutinize it for possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motivations (career-wise benefit) as well as defense lawyers who again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formulate &quot;reality&quot; to suit their wallets, &quot;ain't that right OJ?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Good to see your not lost to us. I take anything put out in widespread press
<BR>
releases by leftist 'public interest' groups with a large swig of salt, lime, and
<BR>
tequila. Its the only way to stomach much of what they say, and frequently that
<BR>
doesn't even work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After looking into some of the militia's personally, and finding their booths
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loaded with literature of a truely doubtful patriotism; one can surmise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty much who they are.  Let me make it clearer, the pamphlets and such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were klan material intermixed with anti-tax and anti-government crapolla.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What am I supposed to decide, coupled with reports that appear to butress my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own personal experiences?  Actually, I am not interested in feeling safer by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking away your firearms.  I just want to have mine when the mouth breathers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and droolers come over the hill.
</EM><BR>
<P>The phenomenon of white supremacists becoming militant has as much to do with the
<BR>
actions of the government as it does with their own ignorance and hate. If the
<BR>
government did not systematically deny people their natural rights as a whole or
<BR>
based on class or other easy to see superficial differences, then these groups
<BR>
would not enjoy any support. The divisive labeling that goes on in the press
<BR>
releases and other statements of liberal/leftist groups is as vicous, as
<BR>
ignorant, as shallow, and as unconducive to resolving issues as any propaganda
<BR>
put out by the Aryan Nations. The only difference is that the
<BR>
mercantilist/socialist controlled media gives the former front page treatment and
<BR>
full credibility, while laughing at the latter.
