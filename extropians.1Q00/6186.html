</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and a hell of a lot of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *Which screen* you look at depends on *what* you're looking for.  If I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to find out what *you* did today, I command &quot;play Fabulich video 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;03-29-2000,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 6:00 to 18:00 PST&quot; and your boring day plays out on my monitor for 9 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hours,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or until I get bored and press &quot;stop.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're DEEPLY missing the point here.  Sure, if you know when and where to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look, you can see what was going on there.  How did you know that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needed to look at *my* video to find the murder?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not looking to solve any random murders.  Where in the world did that 
<BR>
come from?  Let me try to explain it again.  I would be able to use the 
<BR>
system to obtain (1) specific data that is relevant to me and my concerns or 
<BR>
(2) random bits of the data stream that would have no relevance to me 
<BR>
whatsever, other than some prurient thrill I might derive from watching 
<BR>
random strangers going about the boring days.
<BR>
<P>This whole &quot;crime solving&quot; bit came up when you said it would take extreme 
<BR>
amounts of computing power to determine when a crime had been committed.  My 
<BR>
reply was: no, if I'm watching you and I happen to see you slit a child's 
<BR>
throat, it would not take a forensic expert nor a supercomputer to figure 
<BR>
out that a crime has probably been committed.  But *my* purpose in using the 
<BR>
system would not be to solve every random crime that was ever committed.  To 
<BR>
the extent that I would be interested in using it for crime-solving purposes 
<BR>
it would be primarily to solve crimes that are of *relevance* to me.  For 
<BR>
instance, if my wife disappeared, I would be able to search her records and 
<BR>
document that she had been abducted, when, where and by whom.
<BR>
<P>It seems that you are bootstrapping your way into your argument by first 
<BR>
hypothesizing that the system would need to be used for things way beyond 
<BR>
what I am suggesting and then knocking down that strawman by saying that 
<BR>
only the government would have the computing power to do that.  I 
<BR>
*personally* don't need or want to track every single human on the planet, 
<BR>
or to solve every crime in the world.  And that is *not* what I have ever 
<BR>
suggested in this thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How did you know when to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look? How does the computer know where I was?  All of this requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinker/computer to stare at the screen and do some processing.  Without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it, you can't even make the above simple request for &quot;Fabulich.&quot;  On the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other hand, you COULD request &quot;Yale University, undergraduate room 472B,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;03-29-2000, 6 to 18 EST&quot;, but it's not at all obvious how you figured out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to look THERE knowing only that you wanted to find a murder.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm *not* looking to find a murder.  Again, in order for you to have any 
<BR>
relevance to me I would have to know you to some degree.  In that case I 
<BR>
would know (or be able to find out) your URL, whatever it might be (ID#, 
<BR>
SSN, whatever).  Once I know your URL, finding data on you should be as easy 
<BR>
as finding yahoo.com.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Again, which &quot;screen&quot; you look *at* depends on what you are looking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*for*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Think of the web as a huge database (which in effect it is).  Right now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there are millions and millions of pages on the web.  But you don't need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do any big time &quot;data analysis&quot; to use the web.  Why?  You go to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; handy-dandy search engine, type in what you are looking for and viola! a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nice neat little list of choices pops up for you to choose from.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe this is such a hard concept to grasp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A very large amount of preprocessing has gone into the Internet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything you can search for there has been painstakingly typed in by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human in a form that is easily searchable.  It's already stored as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information which the computer knows to be text.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You may not be aware of this, but it's very difficult to get a computer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;correctly recognize that a picture of a given page of text is text at all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say nothing of figuring out which text.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;lots of programming stuff snipped&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This IS a VERY hard problem.  It's a problem which we cannot solve today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;OK,&quot; you might say.  &quot;The AI of tomorrow will solve it.  It'll be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful.  It'll use all the latest buzzwords.&quot;  Fine.  But that's a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of processing power you're talking about.  Whoever controls all that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processing power gets to keep the results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Listen, I never said it would be easy or simple.  All I ever said is that it 
<BR>
would be good, and as far as I can tell at some point it will be possible.  
<BR>
Just because something is difficult doesn't mean that it should not be done. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was difficult founding the US government, and going to the moon.  They 
<BR>
both involved a great deal of soul searching, debate, planning and detailed 
<BR>
preparation.  But they were possible, there were accomplished and they were 
<BR>
good.
<BR>
<P>You also keep going back to whoever &quot;controls&quot; the processing power.  And I 
<BR>
keep trying to steer you back to the web/database searching analogy.  Since 
<BR>
it would deal with video and voice it might be harder than searching for 
<BR>
text.  But there *already* are video and photo search engines, crude though 
<BR>
they may be.  I don't imagine that it will be prohibitively difficult to 
<BR>
engineer.  A database is a database, no matter what it contains.  Text, tags 
<BR>
or other identifiers could be appended to any type of data or file.  Have 
<BR>
you ever searched for a song using Napster?  Same thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Go back to the web analogy.  The government doesn't control the search
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; engines now.  There is no reason that the &quot;government&quot; would have to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the transparency servers I talk about.  Sure there could be government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; servers, but those would not be the *only* ones.  Given the importance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the integrity of the data in such a society, redundancy would be the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;word of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the day.  Probably the best solution would call for an oversight body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; containing both government officials and civilians, like police review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boards.  Reliable checks and balances systems are not all that difficult 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; implement.  After all here in the US we've been doing them for over 200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Could happen.  Nobody (except maybe Lorrey) will argue that if the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you describe is implemented, it's guaranteed to result in a totalitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state.  But every technology which benefits the powerful more than it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefits the weak makes this MORE likely.  Again, my argument is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since this system makes despotism easier, more likely, etc. we should, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever extent possible, avoid it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think transparency will benefit the state more than the people.  In 
<BR>
fact the system could almost certainly be designed to prevent that.  Think 
<BR>
of China and the Internet.  Sure the Chinese government has bigger and 
<BR>
stronger computers than anybody else in China.  Does that mean that the 
<BR>
government will benefit more from the huge database that is the Internet 
<BR>
than the populace will? My bet is that the Internet will help to bring down 
<BR>
totalitarianism in China like it did in Russia.  I see no reason why this 
<BR>
same dynamic should not apply (and even more so) to a distributed, robust 
<BR>
and redundant power proportional mutual transparency network.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The gov't doesn't control the web servers today, but it has no reason to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do so.  It WOULD have a reason to try to seize control of servers of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind you're describing.  And it would know if you ever tried to resist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't think the Chinese government would like to control the web 
<BR>
servers?  Problem is the network is distributed, robust, and redundant, so 
<BR>
they *can't*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Checks and balances can work, but if the price was right, a despot would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;throw them out the window.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's why we need to do away with *despotism*, not transparency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But, once again, regardless of who was in control of the servers, as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the system was sufficiently transparent it would not matter.  All that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; needed is that the transparency of the process can be assured (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; verified).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Look, allow me to provide a theoretical account from first principles.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;order to stop wrongdoing, you need all of the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1)  You need to have the information that wrongdoing is going on. 2)  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to recognize that wrongdoing is going on, and determine relevant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information about it (where it's happening, who's doing it, what you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to do to stop it, given the power to do so, etc.). 3)  You must have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the physical force to stop the wrongdoing, or you must be believed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have the force to stop the wrongdoing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the Very Extreme Case, consider the situation where I've got guns and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shields and 1 and 2, whereas you only have 1.  You MUST agree that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*this* case, despite the fact that the scenario is perfectly transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(&quot;look ma! it's transparent BOTH WAYS&quot;) there isn't jack shit you can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, you know that YOU'RE opposed to despotism, but do you know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others are also opposed?  Probably not.  Why?  Because the gov't in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenario has 1 and 2; it knows when you're trying to find subversives; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;knows what that looks like and can identify them instantly.  You know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it knows this.  You don't know whether your neighbor is willing to revolt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or whether he's too scared to do so.  You also know that the last time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;somebody asked somebody else whether they were willing to revolt, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government had them shot.  Nobody found out until it was too late, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they had 1, but not 2, which would have allowed them to find out in time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The point here is that having 2 when everyone else doesn't is a huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advantage.  Having 2 and 3 when everyone else doesn't gives you the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be a despot.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look, the fact of the matter is that despotism never has, and never will 
<BR>
exist in the US.  When/if there is a global government, chances are it will 
<BR>
be modeled on the US (or the UN) and despotism will be nearly impossible to 
<BR>
impose and certainly impossible to maintain.  I've said it over and over, 
<BR>
but apparently it needs saying some more: despotism and totalitarianism 
<BR>
thrive on secrecy.  Ubiquitous two-way power proportional transparency does 
<BR>
*away* with secrecy and, at the same time, with despotism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Keep the Internet analogy in mind.  *Tons* of data, almost no data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crunching.  What you want is what you get, when you want it.  Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would you think our ability to sort, organize, store and retrieve data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will get *worse* in the future than it is now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It won't.  Video data is much harder to process than text.  That's what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will make it harder.
</EM><BR>
<P>Harder is not impossible.  Besides, you keep overlooking the fact that text 
<BR>
based tags and identifiers that can be appended and/or linked to *any* type 
<BR>
of file.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
