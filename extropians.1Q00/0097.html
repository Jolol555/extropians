<P>
Almost a year ago Ian Goddard wrote a convincing update on the TWA 800
<BR>
downing.  I was at a party yesterday, talking to a 747 freight pilot, and
<BR>
discovered he knew a great deal about the TWa 800 saga as he had taken a
<BR>
deep interest in it.
<BR>
<P>He claimed he had seen (and regretted not photocopying at the time) a report
<BR>
by one of the on-site investigators, showing a seat in the row where the
<BR>
apparent missile hit, had clearly been blown upwards through the roof by an
<BR>
explosion directly beneath it.  This seat was a considerable distance away
<BR>
from where the supposed fuel tank blast could have affected it and lends
<BR>
very strong credence to the missile hit.
<BR>
<P>He said also that had there really been the remotest suspicion of a problem
<BR>
causing the fuel tank to have exploded, every single 747 throughout the
<BR>
world would have been grounded instantly until the problem was either
<BR>
proven, and then rectified on every plane, or established to be unfounded.
<BR>
This was not the case.  Not one single 747 anywhere was grounded for checks.
<BR>
Why not?
<BR>
<P>He said without a shadow of doubt in his mind and in the mind of many other
<BR>
commecial pilots that it was a huge cover up by the US government too
<BR>
embarrassed to dare to admit in that their navy had shot a civilian airliner
<BR>
down in error with a practice missile.
<BR>
<P>It is one more small piece of weight in a very compelling argument.

<P> &gt;
 &gt;    DISAPPEARED NEWS - THE ORWELLIAN NIGHTMARE
 &gt;
 &gt;    One of the more disturbing issues surrounding the
 &gt;    TWA Flight 800 crash has been the claims made by
 &gt;    some people that on the night of the crash they
 &gt;    saw reports on TV that confirmed a missile hit,
 &gt;    yet the reports apparently disappeared into an
 &gt;    Orwellian black hole. NOW a news cameraman has
 &gt;    spilled-the-beans on one of these disappeared
 &gt;    TV reports, indicating that what people have
 &gt;    been saying they saw on TV really was on TV.
