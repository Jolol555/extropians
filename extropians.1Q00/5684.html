<EM>&gt; &gt; Its funny that people like you are the ones who say that Mutual Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Destruction is insane, when its the same exact principle. MAD assumes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neither party can be trusted, and only the external threat of instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; annihilation is what keeps both parties in check. The MAD strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; completely on the idea that both sides had to keep as total a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveillance on the others activities as possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But did MAD work?  Angelo Codevilla, in _Informing Statecraft_ (see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html</A>), tells of how a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence came up in the 1980s and early 1990s that the Soviets, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were preparing for an all out nuclear war.  Whether this was paranoia on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their part or the planning stages of a first strike remains to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That the Soviets also continued a military buildup -- in both conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and nuclear forces -- seems to support the latter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whether it worked or not is irrelevant. The Soviets are the example of
<BR>
the 
<BR>
individual without honor or integrity. My position is that it was and is 
<BR>
unreasonable and unconstitutional for our nation's leaders to place US 
<BR>
in the same position as a bunch of untrustworthy thugs and tyrants.
<BR>
<P>You do not structure your society expaecting everyone to behave as
<BR>
poorly 
<BR>
as the worst member, because given such expectation, many surely will 
<BR>
behave in such a manner. Expecting people to behave honorably as a
<BR>
default 
<BR>
raises the standard of performance, and you only treat those who do not 
<BR>
do so (criminals) by a different standard once they have done so.
<BR>
<P>You argument that this is insufficient in a world where an individual 
<BR>
will have the capability to destroy the earth does give one pause as to 
<BR>
whether this is still rational to expect, since it only would take one 
<BR>
bad apple. I would rather live in a world where the bad apples are 
<BR>
weeded out early, a la, David Brin's concept of declaring Propationary 
<BR>
Personalities (see his Uplift War trilogy), than to have a wholesale 
<BR>
abrogation of the rights of the individual, and I think that since we do 
<BR>
have a bit of a 'ramping up' period ahead of us, that this be tried
<BR>
first.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's also notable that the Soviets mainly targeted, from what we know now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military and industrial centers -- not population centers.  (Granted, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often overlap, but the fact that they targetted when they did overlap sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of means they might have been really planning for a first strike.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And MAD, as a US policy -- not a Soviet one, was only in place for about two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decades.  Not enough of a sample in my mind to say it work or not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not about to join the John Birch Society hre, just pointing out some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things I read.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; savages and have no honor or rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Honor does not pay the rent.  Anyway, if one looks at honor as the desire to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be moral, and if one doesn't accept the kind of Platonic morality Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hints at, but the more worldly, Aristotelean or Objectivist one I tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toward, then the goal of morality is successful life -- not to be honorable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in spite of what will be, but to be honorable in hopes of what will be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but it does keep the landlord and tenant both on their best
<BR>
behavior, 
<BR>
without the extortion of overwhelming force, or the might of public
<BR>
humiliation.
