Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitochondrial damage and the proportion of effete
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondria in cells increase with age. According to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondrial theory of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aging, this phenomenon is mostly due to oxidative damage and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a major (and, some argue, the main) determinant of aging.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be argued briefly that this phenomenon plays a role that is not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exclusively crucial in aging. It will also be contended,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;essentially on theoretical grounds (for lack of sufficient current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;information), that there is low probability that the accumulation of reduced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;degradation of affected mitochondria is due to diminished production of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hydroxyl radicals, as suggested by Aubrey and de Grey (1997) and expanded by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kowald (in this issue). What seems more likely is that the phagolysosomal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disposal system of effete mitochondria is considerably altered in cells of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aging organisms. Also, in view of the significant role of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;damaged mitochondria in the initial steps in apoptosis and the lack of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence of massive apoptosis of cells in senescent individuals, the damage
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that exists may be milder than anticipated by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondrial theory of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aging. A brief fundamental summary on the biology of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondria is included for the sake of better understanding the arguments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;presented in this article. Also, suggestions are made for experimental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;testing of the hypotheses presented by Aubrey and de Grey (1997) and Kowald
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(1999). [References: 16]

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mitochondrial theory of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aging states that the slow accumulation of impaired
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondria is the driving force of the aging process. In
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recent years, this theory has gained new support with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;discovery of age-related mitochondrial DNA deletions.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the underlying mechanism of the accumulation of defective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondria remained unclear. This has changed recently with the proposal of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;de Grey that damaged mitochondria have a decreased degradation rate. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resulting increase in biological half-life would be a strong selection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage leading to the accumulation of defective mitochondria. In this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;article, I summarize current ideas on how damaged organelles can build up in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a cell as well as the shortcomings of these ideas. Then the new hypothesis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and its justification are described. It appears that de Grey's hypothesis is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a very promising concept that elegantly solves inconsistencies of current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;models and is in accordance with experimental findings. [References: 42]
