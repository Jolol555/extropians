<EM>&gt; &gt; While I agree with what Billy is saying here for the most part, Earth is
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as tame as some might think.  Even now, some climatists have proposed
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Earth has completely frozen over several times in its history and
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rapid climate change followed by stable periods might be the rule.  (See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; by Paul F. Hoffman and Daniel P. Schrag in _Scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; American_ 2000 Jan for the former (now at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html">http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html</A>) and &quot;Rapid Climate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Change&quot; by Kendrick Taylor in _American Scientist_ 1999 July-August.)
</EM><BR>
This
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is by no means like a highly elliptical orbiting planet scenario, say,
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Poul Anderson's _A Circus of Hells_, or the OnOff Star scenario in
</EM><BR>
Vernor
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vinge's _A Deepness in the Sky_, but it should give one pause.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, the basis of the earth's deep freeze occilations were due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the travels of the continents. With most continental areas on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equator and periods of heavy vulcanism, such periods were a natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequence. During this period, antarctica was not at the south pole,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so it was not sequestering 3/4+ of the ice on the planet. No land locked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ice cap meant sea levels 200 meters higher than they are now. Higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pressure at the bottom of the ocean allowed greater sequestration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; methane hydrates under the ocean floors, and thus less methane in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere(methane is about 6x more effective as a greenhouse gas) The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss of methane causes a cooldown, increases in ocean ice caps, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glacial buildup, the vulcanism of the newly spreading continents kept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dust levels high. The CO2 concentrations and global climate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature are linked only by a log relationship, such that CO2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concentrations variances at low levels have wide impact on temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fluctuations, but as concentrations increase, this effect falls off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to my geologist cousin, essentially if we dropped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmospheric CO2 levels by 50%, we'd drop global temps by 20-30 degrees,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while if we increase them by 50% from the current levels, global temps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will go up by less than 5 degrees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to Drew, the antarctic ice cap (the large one, not the small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one on the coast) is stable over the long term, and its been that way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the last major extinction/possible impact period of 22 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ago. The winds flow outward from the cap (the catabatic winds),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and are replenished from cold upper atmospheric air that drops down from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high altitudes (and the higher altitudes are cooling down while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface levels of temperate climates is warming up.) The Greenland ice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cap may collapse, and the arctic ice cap will most likely vanish in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few decades. If the Greenland ice cap collapses, it will result in sea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level rises of 3-9 meters at most. If only the arctic ice cap melts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away, there will be little or no sea level changes, because that ice is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already floating in the water. Any rise will simply be due to thermal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expansion of the oceans.
</EM><BR>
<P>Michael's point being?  I was merely trying to focus attention on some
<BR>
recent work that shows the Earth's climate  is not as stable as some might
<BR>
think.  The actual instabilities now being theorized are much greater than
<BR>
was once thought.  E.g., the &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; scenario posits that the
<BR>
oceans completely froze over to a depth of about a kilometer and surface
<BR>
temperatues of about -50 degrees C.  This is a much more drastic than former
<BR>
ice age scenarios.  (Of course, according Hoffman and Schrag to it did not
<BR>
happen all that often either.:)
<BR>
<P>Not that Michael's above points are wrong.  I don't want to debate global
<BR>
climate changes anyway.  My only reason for bringing up this work was to
<BR>
show that life has survived through some pretty serious sh*t here on Earth,
<BR>
which gives me hope it has done so elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>This still doesn't mean there are lots of sentients out there, and I fear
<BR>
the Great Silence attests to their nonexistence.
<BR>
<P>Prove me wrong!  Please!
