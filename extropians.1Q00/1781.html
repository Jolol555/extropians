Wow, that is so loony but so great. So I wonder...
<BR>
<P>&lt;Attention conservation warning: skip this part, they're all obvious to
<BR>
any zetetic observer of Radical New Energy&gt;
<BR>
<P>1) will they (will anyone) ever extract a net positive short-term energy
<BR>
output (ignoring the sunk cost of manufacturing, but not any sensor
<BR>
excitation)? If not, it's still a kewl sensor for a Tricorder. :)
<BR>
2) ditto, but the next level up, and what is the positive energy flux
<BR>
density practically attainable, at what scale of array (including the
<BR>
net energy budget cost of anything such as element cooling)?... Now we
<BR>
can talk about things like powering autonomous *deep* space probes &amp;
<BR>
such. If the energy flux density attainable is high enough, go on to Q.
<BR>
3.
<BR>
3) the first hard one: will this stuff, if it gets through #1 and #2, be
<BR>
able to compete with carbon-oxygen (combustion) energy tech? This
<BR>
includes all the sunk costs people account for. Most solar tech doesn't
<BR>
quite get it, yet, but some people are rich enough to do it anyway. This
<BR>
is where fuel cells are for the time being, but not much longer, we
<BR>
hope.
<BR>
4) the second hard one: what will the impact be, both of the MEMS
<BR>
manufacturing (probably manageable) and of massive tapping of the
<BR>
Casimir force, should it take place? And other typically unaccounted for
<BR>
costs, if any. Dilithium crystal Superfund site, anyone?
<BR>
<P>Bonus high weirdness question: what happens to space-time itself if too
<BR>
much Casimir energy is tapped? Paging Dr. Hawking...

<EM>&gt; Apparently, there is a startup company that is designing a MEMS device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to extract power from the vacuum using the Casimir effect. The company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was started by a Prof. Jordan Maclay who seems to have reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credentials. Robert Forward is also involved. They also have a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of grant funding from NASA. There is isn't a whole lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information on their page <A HREF="http://www.quantumfields.com/">http://www.quantumfields.com/</A> but their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approach seems realistic both from a physics and a MEMS capability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viewpoint. In fact, it doesn't seem to require anything more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existing (albeit state-of-the-art)engineering. If so, this seems to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite a significant development. Can anyone more familiar with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Casimir effect comment ?
