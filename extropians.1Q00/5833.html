Missed this one due to the usual suspects: high list traffic and low time to
<BR>
look it all over.:/

<EM>&gt; Comparing it to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is like comparing Jewel's poems to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wow, that is really saying something!  Jewel is not too well liked in
</EM><BR>
Alaska
<BR>
<EM>&gt; after she denied being an Alaskan in a California interview.  The local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radiostations mock her and there was a &quot;I used to know Jewel before she
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; famous&quot; article in a paper that wasn't too flattering.  She cancelled her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last concert here which put the final nail in her coffin.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But even if the film were good, it would not be like &quot;2001&quot; simply because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kubrick was going down a different path. (If you wanta film that's similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to &quot;2001,&quot; see Takovsky's &quot;Solaris.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have seen _Solaris_ and own a copy of the video.  I had a hard time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initially getting into it but then got hooked into the story.  It was very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eerie realizing what was going on.  Some friends of mine called it boring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but never gave it a chance.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is boring if you're looking for the typical science fiction film --
<BR>
action, aliens, and a love interest thrown in.  Both the movie and the novel
<BR>
are toward the cerebral end of science fiction.  (I'm not trying to say you
<BR>
can have action, good special effects, etc. and an interesting theme, but
<BR>
the industry tends to segregate the two.)
<BR>
<P>I do admit, however, that the movie was even on this end a bit slow moving
<BR>
and some of the scenes seemed suprfluous, especially, for those who have
<BR>
seen it, the one of the guy driving in the car with his son.  To me, that
<BR>
scene added nothing to the story.  That's why I don't think mentioning it
<BR>
here is a spoiler for those who might see it.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I would not expect any given science fiction film to hold up to the
<BR>
standards of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;  My problem with &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; and
<BR>
most science fiction films is the stories suck.  They do not even try to be
<BR>
great stories and fail.  They try to be mediocre stories and go for cool
<BR>
special effects.
<BR>
<P>And there's a lot of science fiction literature out there that could be
<BR>
adapted to film.  Look at how the movie industry sticks, sadly, to pretty
<BR>
much the same grove all the time -- in a lot of areas.  How many remakes of
<BR>
&quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; do we need?  (It kind of reminds me of the
<BR>
classical music scene, where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a
<BR>
Bach concert, but look for Rebel or Tartini and you'll have to swing a whole
<BR>
animal shelter full of them before coming up pay dirt.  And I love Bach!)
<BR>
<P>Maybe what science fiction film needs is a spat of low budget directors --
<BR>
independents and experimentalists -- who can pull off a full blockbusters so
<BR>
as to shift the market...  But then most science fiction film fans I've met
<BR>
are all for special effects and stupid stories.  (Present company
<BR>
excluded.:)  Heck, I know a few people who even liked last year's &quot;Star
<BR>
Wars&quot; film.:@
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another great Russian film is _Stalker_ and tells the story of some sort
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; meteorite that somehow 'warped' the reality around the crashsite in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everchanging way.  A 'tourguide' takes a small group into the forbidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area.  This film is excellent and very philosophical.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't &quot;Stalker&quot; or any of his other films yet.
