<P><EM>&gt; Are there any web sites out there for people who share our vision of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, but who don't share our political vision -- and who are what we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would classify as fascists or something along those lines?  Sort of like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skinheads, only pro-technoprogress, life extension, space colonization,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotechnology?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not seen anything quite like that, most of the
<BR>
&quot;near-but-not-really-transhumanists&quot; are more new age. The followers
<BR>
of LaRouche seem to be pro-technology, but only when it is big
<BR>
centralized tech, not anything like the Internet or genetic
<BR>
engineering. There are a few people quietly arguing for eugenics
<BR>
(mostly to combat the accumulation of genetic defects that would
<BR>
otherwise be weeded away by natural selection), but they do not strike
<BR>
me as more than a single issue view or neoconservatives.
<BR>
<P>I think transhumanism in its current form is quite incompatible with
<BR>
fascism, but this has not always been true. I re-read Stapledon's
<BR>
_Last and First Men_ and _Starmaker_ yesterday, and many utopian or
<BR>
semi-utopian societies he discussed would appear fascist or communist
<BR>
to a modern reader (even if he also pointed out the differences in
<BR>
many cases; besides, when you're a part of a planetary mind politics
<BR>
as we know it become something uttrely different). The same goes for
<BR>
Bernal's _The World, The Flesh, The Devil_, which suggests that the
<BR>
future of humanity is a kind of cyborg communism in space. This form
<BR>
of transhumanism got quite unfashionable after the war.
<BR>
<P>However, our current memes are antithetical to much of fascism because
<BR>
they emphasize qualitative change over time, someting that contradicts
<BR>
the pragmatic and/or philosophical underpinnings of much of
<BR>
fascism. Of course a technocratic version of transhumanism could
<BR>
develop where change is acceptable but only when harnessed for the
<BR>
public good, but it sounds very much like this would go the way of
<BR>
Soviet technological advance - it doesn't work well together with a
<BR>
rigid society. Another idea that tends to fly in the face of fascists
<BR>
is, as Remi Sussan pointed out, that the posthuman is a metis, a
<BR>
combination of human, machine, genes and memes from whatever sources
<BR>
work. This mixture is unacceptable to the fascist mindset, which tends
<BR>
to empahsize unity and purity while regarding anything composite as
<BR>
suspect.
<BR>
<P>To use Postrel's terminology, the tranhumanist fascists, if they
<BR>
exist, should be located somewhere in the technocrat part of
<BR>
stasism. But this naturally prevents them from exploring all the
<BR>
possibilities new technologies would suggest, and they would be forced
<BR>
to argue for just the basic effects of the technologies (nanotech to
<BR>
reduce material scarcity, life extension will just extend life etc),
<BR>
which we instead think about their second-level implications. This
<BR>
gives us a natural advantage and the ability to do more adequate
<BR>
social and philosophical analysis of what is going on.
