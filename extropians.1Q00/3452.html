To Eugene:
<BR>
Thanks for posting the slides. I knew there were some around somewhere.
<BR>
One of those slides now serves as wallpaper for my PC desktop.
<BR>
Do you know if these are from a cryo-patient? James Gallagher, maybe?
<BR>
Anyway, keep up the good work. I am more optimistic than you, but want much 
<BR>
more research.
<BR>
<P><P>On another note, here is an excerpt from the latest New Scientist article on 
<BR>
the nature of the universe. Any comments on the implications of this theory 
<BR>
for extro-cryo-immortalist hopes?
<BR>
<P>Begin excerpt:
<BR>
<P>IF YOU COULD LIFT A CORNER of the veil that shrouds reality, what would you 
<BR>
see beneath? Nothing but randomness, say two Australian physicists. 
<BR>
According to Reginald Cahill and Christopher Klinger of Flinders University 
<BR>
in Adelaide, space and time and all the objects around us are no more than 
<BR>
the froth on a deep sea of randomness.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that randomness is a part of the Universe. 
<BR>
After all, physicists tell us that empty space is a swirling chaos of 
<BR>
virtual particles. And randomness comes into play in quantum theory--when a 
<BR>
particle such as an electron is observed, its properties are randomly 
<BR>
selected from a set of alternatives predicted by the equations.
<BR>
<P><P>But Cahill and Klinger believe that this hints at a much deeper randomness. 
<BR>
&quot;Far from being merely associated with quantum measurements, this randomness 
<BR>
is at the very heart of reality,&quot; says Cahill. If they are right, they have 
<BR>
created the most fundamental of all physical theories, and its implications 
<BR>
are staggering. &quot;Randomness generates everything,&quot; says Cahill. &quot;It even 
<BR>
creates the sensation of the 'present', which is so conspicuously absent 
<BR>
from today's physics.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Their evidence comes from a surprising quarter--pure mathematics. In 1930, 
<BR>
the Austrian-born logician Kurt Gödel stunned the mathematical world with 
<BR>
the publication of his incompleteness theorem. It applied to formal 
<BR>
systems--sets of assumptions and the statements that can be deduced from 
<BR>
those assumptions by the rules of logic. For example, the Greeks developed 
<BR>
their geometry using a few axioms, such as the idea that there is only one 
<BR>
straight line through any pair of points. It seemed that a clever enough 
<BR>
mathematician could prove any theorem true or false by reasoning from 
<BR>
axioms.
<BR>
<P>But Gödel proved that, for most sets of axioms, there are true theorems that 
<BR>
cannot be deduced. In other words, most mathematical truths can never be 
<BR>
proved.
<BR>
<P>This bombshell could easily have sent shock waves far beyond mathematics. 
<BR>
Physics, after all, is couched in the language of maths, so Gödel's theorem 
<BR>
might seem to imply that it is impossible to write down a complete 
<BR>
mathematical description of the Universe from which all physical truths can 
<BR>
be deduced. Physicists have largely ignored Gödel's result, however. &quot;The 
<BR>
main reason was that the result was so abstract it did not appear to connect 
<BR>
directly with physics,&quot; says Cahill.
<BR>
<P>But then, in the 1980s, Gregory Chaitin of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research 
<BR>
Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, extended Gödel's work, and made a 
<BR>
suggestive analogy. He called Gödel's unprovable truths random truths. What 
<BR>
does that mean? Mathematicians define a random number as one that is 
<BR>
incompressible. In other words, it cannot be generated by an algorithm--a 
<BR>
set of instructions or rules such as a computer program--that is shorter 
<BR>
than the number. Chaitin defined random truths as ones that cannot be 
<BR>
derived from the axioms of a given formal system. A random truth has no 
<BR>
explanation, it just is.
<BR>
<P>The rest of it is here:
