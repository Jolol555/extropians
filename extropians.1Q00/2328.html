&quot;A dedicated scholar be you Spike&quot;, says Obie-Wan Bradbury.
<BR>
<P>I had wrestled a bit with this problem a bit previously and
<BR>
what you need to deal with are heat capacity and heat transfer.
<BR>
<P>You need to do something like bring in liquid hydrogen cooled
<BR>
almost to absolute zero, let it flow though channels in the JB
<BR>
letting it boil, then put it into containers that are ejected
<BR>
on the other side of the JB that reliquify the H2 in space
<BR>
and orbit back around to the LH2 dropoff point.  Or, since there
<BR>
is no atmosphere required for a JB, you could use something like
<BR>
Moravec's rotating skyhooks to do continual momentum transfer
<BR>
between orbiting radiators/condensers and the surface.  The
<BR>
interesting thing about these approaches is that they do let
<BR>
you separate the radiator temperature from the CPU operating
<BR>
temperature to a large degree.
<BR>
<P>The only way I've seen to do the heat transfer effectively is using
<BR>
liquids.  Even in the orbiting CPU-satellites of a MB, you still
<BR>
consume a sizeable fraction of the power for CPU to radiator
<BR>
coolant circulation.  After Anders paper came out, I thought
<BR>
he might solve the JB problem by having really *huge* coolant
<BR>
pipe (reducing the friction and therefore power requirements
<BR>
somewhat), but the real problem is nano-CPU cooling.  You have
<BR>
all of those small capillaries through the nano-CPUs and
<BR>
you are going to get a lot of friction pumping the phase
<BR>
change coolant through.  The only possible &quot;out&quot; for that
<BR>
I've imagined might be a superfluid coolant like liquid He.
<BR>
<P>Another question that comes to mind is *what* are the heat
<BR>
transfer properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate?  Since
<BR>
I'm under the impression it functions as a &quot;single&quot; atom,
<BR>
it ought to have fantastic heat conduction values over
<BR>
a rather large volume.  Better than diamond?
