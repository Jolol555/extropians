I remember once when I had been invited to a party as
<BR>
a small child and the conversation among the children
<BR>
drifted to death... they asked me if I'd had relatives
<BR>
who died, and I said yes, and then they asked whether
<BR>
I was sad, and I said, &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;  They thought I
<BR>
was a monster, or something... I sincerely hadn't
<BR>
sorted out my feelings towards death, feeling I didn't
<BR>
have sufficient information at the time.
<BR>
I decided to go home and half the people were bawling
<BR>
their eyes out... it was disastrous.
<BR>
Never quite felt different from other people as much
<BR>
as I did on that day.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; have that feeling of invulnerability that the young

<EM>&gt; any proposed plan of

<EM>&gt; 'wild and crazy' things

<EM>&gt; that my friends all remember so fondly, and would

<EM>&gt; never do again...
