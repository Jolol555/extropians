<EM>&gt; Hi Frank !,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice to meet you again, by the way !
</EM><BR>
<P>It's my pleasure :)
<BR>
(And I'm still grateful for that copy of ch. 7 of
<BR>
&quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; that you gave me in Weesp :)

<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. It is well known (I think :) that in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *pessimism* is a better tool for success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree, I maintain that (rational) optimism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is different from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naivete') is *always* a better tool for success.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that raises the question how much of what's usually
<BR>
called &quot;pessimism&quot; can be understood as &quot;rational optimism&quot;
<BR>
:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Disprove it.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are psychological studies (can't cite any, read this
<BR>
some time ago in a news magazine) showing that pessimistic
<BR>
people perform better than those who call themselves
<BR>
optimists in some tasks (among them being certain branches
<BR>
of science). But you could of course call those optimists
<BR>
&quot;naive optimists&quot;. Nevertheless, I think there is a strong
<BR>
link between criticism and pessimism. It would be fine to
<BR>
develop a kind of optimism that is equally critical, without
<BR>
the downsides of pessimism.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that criticizing hypotheses *is* highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary in science (as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as in other areas of life, I think), but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't say that for example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticizing hypotheses is the *most important*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal or thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's one side of the medal. The other side is creating sound
<BR>
hypotheses - *that* certainly needs optimism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (That's what science is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about: make hypotheses and try to disprove them.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I think that the goal which people try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achieve in science through this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process (of making hypotheses and trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disprove them) is not to falsify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or disprove hypotheses, but a more positive goal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; namely: to find new useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypotheses that work !
</EM><BR>
<P>See above. Some might be more inclined to making hypotheses,
<BR>
others may prefer criticizing and disproving them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, I feel that LIVING D.O. is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced than just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; THINKING optimistically.  You can do the latter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fail to put it into practice, but hardly vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whatever. It is just an arbitrary epithet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labelling either thinking or living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as ''higher''.  I'm not sanguine about which of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the two (living or thinking)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be labelled as ''higher'' than the other.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I'm trying to say is that I see optimistic *thinking*
<BR>
as a prerequisite for an optimistic *life*. Methinks the
<BR>
opposite doesn't have to be true. But you're probably right,
<BR>
we shouldn't argue about this.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; optimistically''.  *Some* people who hardly ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to think in their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and who never heard of philosophy) do, I think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhibit a marvellously D.O.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of living -- they just go do things without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking too much about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible bad outcomes.  That kind of D.O. living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; / D.O. action is possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without thinking deeply.
</EM><BR>
<P>But that's what I would label &quot;naive optimism&quot;. D.O.
<BR>
certainly involves (rational) thinking and decision-making.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Point (2) should be: &quot;Do not believe anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has been falsified.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that's an unnecessarily pessimistic view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :-)&lt;grin&gt;:-).  I think that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ''proof'' *can* be constructive.  I mean, I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a proof can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legitimately consist of showing that something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *can* be done -- instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always showing only that something is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'falsified'.  I even think that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not very well possible to advance into new areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without this kind of positive proof.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here we have to distinguish between science and technology.
<BR>
<P>Science generally makes statements which use &quot;all&quot;
<BR>
quantifiers: a law must hold for *all* the objects it is
<BR>
supposed to describe. Since there usually is a (practically)
<BR>
infinite number of them (all atoms, all wavefunctions...),
<BR>
you can never prove that the law is correct - that would
<BR>
imply showing that it holds for every single object. What
<BR>
you can do is disprove it - it is sufficient to find *one*
<BR>
case where it does not hold.
<BR>
<P>Technology, on the other hand, is about showing that s.th.
<BR>
is possible, it uses &quot;existential&quot; quantifiers. You can
<BR>
never disprove a technology since you can't show that it is
<BR>
impossible to realize forever, everywhere. You can, however,
<BR>
&quot;prove&quot; it by producing one working sample.
<BR>
<P>So, to conclude, it seems to me that optimism is well suited
<BR>
for technologists, but not necessarily for scientists. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Only *dis*proving things (finding out how a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory could be false)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does, I think, not generate enough ''trust'' in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory to go build on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top of it or advance from it (using the theory as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a secure base) in other ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you can rely on it (use it as a working hypothesis) as
<BR>
long as it has not been disproven. You won't get a more
<BR>
secure base.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think we *need* this kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ''justificationalism'', that we cannot do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without it.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is because we grew up with it, we are familiar with it.
<BR>
Bartley describes this as one possible metacontext and lists
<BR>
two others:
<BR>
- the metacontext of nonattachment (example: Zen)
<BR>
- the metacontext of fallibilism (or pancritical
<BR>
rationalism)
<BR>
<P>The first two are supported by religions (in the West and
<BR>
East, resp.), while PCR is incompatible with religion and
<BR>
therefore is fairly new. And it fits Extropianism perfectly.
<BR>
:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In what way do *you* get to new positive theories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with using as your tools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only disproving things; and *without* ever using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive, supportive proof ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't say that criticism is my *only* tool. But I
<BR>
certainly don't try to look for proofs that can't be given.
<BR>
<P>Ciao,
<BR>
Frank
