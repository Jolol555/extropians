<EM>&gt; &gt;Mike someone asked me the other day what was 7.4 meters in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;English units.  I said very loudly &quot;English schmingliiiish!  Think metric!&quot;

<EM>&gt; Amara Graps wrote:  How about cgs?  (centimeter-gram-sec)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Those are the astronomers' units. Unfortunately, cgs *electrodynamics*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculations are not as easy to use...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe horseturds per fortnight makes sense to me now. :{
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually all the units systems we have now are messed up in some
<BR>
way.  The MKS is just less messed up than some of the others.
<BR>
<P>For instance, the fundamental units should not need a prefix.
<BR>
Unfortunately grams and meters are not really well matched
<BR>
in scale, so the MGS is never used.  We are stuck with either
<BR>
meters- *kilo*grams - seconds or the even uglier *centi*meter-
<BR>
gram-second system.
<BR>
<P>The thing we now call a kilogram should have been called a
<BR>
gram to start with.  This would make things a little more symmetric:
<BR>
a cubic meter of water would have a mass of a kilogram,
<BR>
and a cubic millimeter would have a mass of a microgram, and
<BR>
not only that but we would much sooner have been able to
<BR>
use that really cool prefix nano, for such things as expressing
<BR>
the daily requirement of vitamins for instance.  I even like to
<BR>
saaay nano.  nanonanonano.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Now that Im thinking, I recall having tried to invent a system
<BR>
years ago that used the speed of light defined as 1, then
<BR>
derive the other units to go with that, but it didnt work out
<BR>
too well.  Ideas?  spike
