<EM>&gt; &gt; If the show was negative -- I didn't see it -- has anyone decided to
</EM><BR>
write
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to Fox and say that portrayal was unfair?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thinking it over, I reverse my earlier stance: the Fox show was about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as balanced as I would expect.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay.  I did not see it, so I can't say.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If they had been positive about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonics it mighta started to look like an infomercial.  They had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deathist on there urging people to just die and let our grandchildren
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run the show [he *assumed* we have offspring],
</EM><BR>
<P>I take it he was an altruist type, reasoning that it's selfish (in the
<BR>
conventional sense of being bad and inconsiderate) to live longer than three
<BR>
score and ten years.  I wonder how consistent he would be in this if
<BR>
cryonics actually worked.  My bet is if and when cryonics does work -- in
<BR>
the sense of reviving patients -- people will trip over each to sign up.
<BR>
Surely, a small %age of the population will still say no to near
<BR>
immortality, but I doubt the vast majority will.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; they had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; David Brin, who was more or less neutral [saying current corpsicles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have ~5% chance of drawing a breath sometime in the future],
</EM><BR>
<P>Not that I think that Brin is wrong here or that his number is off, but
<BR>
where do people derive such numbers from?  It just seems to me that using
<BR>
numbers like that is a way to garb uncertainties and unknown in mathematical
<BR>
dress to hide them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Merkel whose stance was predictable.  {8-]  Overall, perhaps it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is better to present a moderate view of cryonics than a positive one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for even if it gives us a 5% chance, it is infinitely better than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current two alternatives.  Brin's 5% isnt all that different from my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own estimate of cryonics eventual success, altho I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving more toward the optimistic in the past year or two.
</EM><BR>
<P>5% is pretty good odds if you asked me.  How many on this list would be
<BR>
willing to sign up now if someone could guarantee those odds on revival?
<BR>
<P>BTW, did the Fox show also tell where to find out more about cryonics?
