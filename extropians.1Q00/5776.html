<EM>&gt;         I think this is blatantly and obviously BS.  My Grandmother is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dead!  I miss her horribly and feel huge amounts of pain because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this.  She is the creator of my parents and ultimately of me and has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given me much of the world I have.  She deserves this world she gave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me much more than I do.  The fact that she is now dead is BAD!  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking any being could possibly do, whether emotional or purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstract rational thinking like a computer could do, make this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything other than BAD, and the fact that we are still alive Good.

<P>I am sorry to hear you lost someone so close and important to you, and
<BR>
understand why you think that this is bad (and thus, it is).  Not all
<BR>
people see the end of life the same way.  Some religious people see it as
<BR>
an opportunity for a promotion.  Some who are suffering see it as a
<BR>
welcome end.  However, in general those who thought the loss of life was
<BR>
bad (for themselves and family members), avoided it, and left more
<BR>
offspring to continue the idea that the loss of life was bad.  So, that
<BR>
basic value goes in the Creative Tautology bag (things that seem like
<BR>
discoveries, but then you realize it had to be that way).
<BR>
<P>This may be a good time for people on this list to think about the Good v.
<BR>
Bad memeplex.  We need this to provide a foundation for the discussion of
<BR>
the development of future technology, and is directly applicable to the
<BR>
question of how AI devices making decisions will impact *our* future.
<BR>
<P>I like to tell the following story about good and bad.  I do not know
<BR>
where it comes from, perhaps one of you does:
<BR>
<P>Once there was a man who owned a prized stallion.  This horse was admired
<BR>
by his friends, and he gained much stature in the village for having
<BR>
raised this magnificent animal.  The villagers would say, &quot;How good for
<BR>
you that your colt has grown so big and strong.&quot;  The man would say,
<BR>
&quot;Perhaps it is so.&quot;
<BR>
<P>However, one day, his big strong horse kicked down the fence and went off
<BR>
into the mountains.  The villagers came to the man and said, &quot;This is
<BR>
terrible, that your great horse is gone.&quot;  The man replied, &quot;Perhaps it is
<BR>
so.&quot;  But then, a week later, the horse came back to the farm, and brought
<BR>
four wild mares with him.  The villagers said, &quot;This is so good for you;
<BR>
now you have the start of a heard that will bring you much wealth.&quot;  The
<BR>
man replied, &quot;Perhaps it is so.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A week after the return of the man's horse, his only son was badly injured
<BR>
while trying to ride one of the wild mares.  This left him crippled and
<BR>
able to walk only with a crutch.  The villagers said, &quot;Things have turned
<BR>
out as bad as can be.  It would have been better if you horse had never
<BR>
returned.&quot;  The man replied, &quot;Perhaps it is so.&quot;  But then, the next year,
<BR>
war broke out in the next province, and the government came and took away
<BR>
all the sons of the village, except the lame son of the man.  The
<BR>
villagers said ...
