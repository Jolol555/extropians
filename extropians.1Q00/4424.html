<EM>&gt; Is it possible to design a non-linear software program complex enough to

never
<BR>
<EM>&gt; needed?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless the use of currency entails some large disadvantage, the answer
<BR>
should continue to be no despite any improvements in technology.  Why?
<BR>
Because the same technology can be used to increase the efficiency of
<BR>
money-based transactions, and money is inherently more efficient (that O(n)
<BR>
vs O(n^2) thing is a killer).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lets say you want to sell your VW.  Finally a guy contacts you who has 20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bushels of wheat.  You don't need the wheat, but you know a guy in Texas
</EM><BR>
who
<BR>
<EM>&gt; does, and he happens to have a new software program that another contact
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; yours wants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly how is this better than an online sale using money?  The
<BR>
computational requirements are much larger, the probability of there being a
<BR>
possible chain of trades is not especially high, it takes a lot more work on
<BR>
the part of the participants, and it is almost impossible for any
<BR>
participant to know what he should be able to get out of any particular
<BR>
trade.
<BR>
<P>This last point is an especially big problem for such systems.  There may be
<BR>
a few thousand sales of VWs in any given year, but the odds of any of them
<BR>
being traded for wheat are just about zero.  The number of possible trades
<BR>
of dissimilar goods is so large that you will never accumulate a meaningful
<BR>
history on any particular type of exchange, which means no one can tell what
<BR>
their goods are worth.  The only way around this is to use some item as a
<BR>
common intermediary step - in which case you've just re-invented money.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And didn't I just hear that Ford and Daimer-Chrysler are setting up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like this with all of their sub-contractors?
</EM><BR>
<P>Online, yes.  Barter, no.  They use money, as will most sensible people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assuming such a system could be designed, could it not escape the tax
</EM><BR>
system
<BR>
<EM>&gt; entirely?  After all when was the first time you paid taxes on an item at
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; garage sale?
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't pay taxes on garage sale items because they are an insignificant
<BR>
portion of your activities.  Businesses can not escape taxation by
<BR>
obfuscation - the government knows they exist, knows where their employees
<BR>
live, and is capable of coercing them into keeping detailed records of their
<BR>
activities.  The same would be true, to a lesser extent, of individuals who
<BR>
make a living on the system.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure your system would make it more practical than it is now for people
<BR>
to avoid taxation, but the fact that you want to use barter isn't what makes
<BR>
the difference.  The advantage comes from the fact that you are using
<BR>
electronic, global commerce.  You could do the same thing with money, and
<BR>
the legal and practical effects would be the same.
