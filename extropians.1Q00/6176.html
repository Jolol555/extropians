<EM>&gt; &gt; I addressed this earlier too.  You know, (1) it doesn't matter who's running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the system as long as its sufficiently and verifiably transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is false.  Transparency is not enough.  You need transparency, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity to recognize wrongdoing, and the capacity to do something about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (2) the web analogy (&quot;tons of data, hardly any data crunching&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LOTS of data-crunching, you just forget it's going on.  Can you imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system like this if it depended on human agents to type in what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras were seeing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (3)  government-civilian oversight committees, etc., etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which become decreasingly likely as it gets easier and easier to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure I might be worried about that if I lived someplace other than the US or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sometime other than 2000 a.d.  But the fact of the matter is that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plan to take over the US and overturn our democratic republic you will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to (1) control the military and (2) somehow convince the military to (a)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attack their friends and families and (b) do away with the civil liberties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that we as a society have fought and died to preserve for over 200 years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all for the privilege of being able to call you King.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How would you *possibly* do that?  How could you possibly form the military,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; economic and strategic alliances necessary to accomplish that ludicrous goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in a transparent society without somebody getting wind of what you're up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and ruining your party?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You start small and work outwards.  Despotism is a tiring, thankless job,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but at the end of the day, you've got a personal realm of terror that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can call your own.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gee, Zero, you've made a good start already. You've got all sorts of
<BR>
rational arguments about how much this will benefit society, how good it
<BR>
is 'for the children', how its not that difficult or expensive, and that
<BR>
we really don't need things like the bill of rights anyways. I'd say
<BR>
you've reached the Webolos level Despot-in-training. Do some more work,
<BR>
earn some merit badges, and you could be an Eagle-Despot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the curious, you do it like this:  You seize control of a small area,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  (Whoops!  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras aren't lie detectors, are they?)  You seize control of some more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; territory, and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  Repeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted, I left out the hard part, which is actually seizing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; territory, but the principle is tried and true.  And unfortunately, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras can't detect intentions any better than the modern press.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it helps if you can show that the owners of the territory you want
<BR>
to seize wronged you in the past, and that taking this property is
<BR>
merely your just due for living a life of oppression and misery. There's
<BR>
plenty of bleeding heart saps who will eat this stuff up and make your
<BR>
cause their own.
