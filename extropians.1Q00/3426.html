<P>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; I define evil as simply abject selfishness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Funny, that's pretty much how I define what's good and noble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The sine qua non of evil for me is dishonesty. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clearly many people will consider your philosophy of abject selfishness evil. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you enjoy taunting them with that construct? Some selfishness is healthy, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but complete abject selfishness is boring, teious and painfully gauche. It is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-social and associated with all of the &quot;evils'&quot; YOU decribe below
</EM><BR>
<P>The interesting question is whether it is _correct_ to associate it with
<BR>
those evils.  There certainly is a bit of &quot;taunt&quot; in the use of the term;
<BR>
that's also why Rand chose it for the title of her essay &quot;The Virtue of
<BR>
Selfishness&quot;, because its association in the minds of many with evil 
<BR>
things, and reclaiming the term for good uses is a rhetorical effect that
<BR>
sticks in the mind and stimulates thought and discussion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Now I think we probably mostly agree on the specific acts we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would classify as &quot;evil&quot;: murder, torture, etc.; but I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  view these as acts of selfishness, because if one were truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  selfish and educated emself on the best techniques to profit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from others, &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahh. So you are not talking ABJECT selfishness, but &quot;educated&quot; selfishness. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One that is tempered by a need to plese others. If only to better serve one's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own goals.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's hard to parse what you mean here: &quot;abject&quot; means &quot;contemptible&quot;, and
<BR>
I am arguing that selfishness itself is not per se evil, but that certain
<BR>
acts which _are_ evil are (rightly or wrongly) associated with it.  In
<BR>
that sense I suppose I do indeed object to &quot;abject selfishness&quot;, but then
<BR>
I haven't said anything meaningful: i.e. &quot;bad X is bad&quot;.  What I do
<BR>
support is enlightened selfishness, where that is not at all tempered
<BR>
with any need to serve others, but with the simple rational conclusion
<BR>
that serving others is one effective means of accomplishing one's own
<BR>
goals.  This is complete, forward-looking, rational selfishness.  The
<BR>
details of Rand/Stirner egoist philosophy is really one of the &quot;basics&quot;
<BR>
here that I won't go into further; plenty of resources for further study
<BR>
are available on the net.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;  Most acts that are described as &quot;selfish&quot; are not evil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  because they are selfish, but because they exhibit irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  short-term thinking. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So abject selfishness perhpas is not entirely rational?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Since rationality is my basis for a definition of &quot;abject&quot;, again
<BR>
this is merely a tautology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;The truly selfish individual takes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  long view, because ey wants to live forever and be obscenely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rich, not just make a few bucks for the moment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Long or short viewed, the truly selfish individual is not valued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by others, and is often over valued by his/herself. 
</EM><BR>
<P>One's value to others is generally based on how one acts with them,
<BR>
not how one believes.  Acting in ways that encourage others to value
<BR>
you is a good way to accomplish selfish goals.  As far as overvaluing
<BR>
oneself, how is it possible to overvalue that which is the source of
<BR>
all values?
<BR>
