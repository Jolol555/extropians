Funny that Gardner and his buddies don't feel the same way about the author 
<BR>
of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Actually, there were two author's who cowrote the book, Richard J. 
<BR>
Herrnstein and Charles Murray.  Herrnstein died shortly after the book was 
<BR>
published.  He was seen by critics as not having the real research 
<BR>
experience to write the  book, though he was a Harvard trained psychologist.
<BR>
<P>I am quoting from two separate author's from the May 1995 (Volume 40, Number 
<BR>
5) issue of Contemporary Psychology, APA's journal of book reviews.
<BR>
<P>a quote from a book review by Donald Dorfman:
<BR>
One would presume that The Bell Curve represents Herrnstein's final summing 
<BR>
up of a lifetime of objective scholarly research published in peer-reviewed 
<BR>
scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ.
<BR>
<P>Regrettably, the media seem to be totally unaware of the fact that the 
<BR>
deceased Harvard professor never published any scientific research on the 
<BR>
genetic basis of IQ and its relation to race, poverty, or social class in 
<BR>
peer-reviewed scientific journals in his entire 36-year academic career. 
<BR>
Richard Herrnstein's actual area of expertise is the experimental analysis 
<BR>
of decision making in pigeons and rats, and he never studied the genetic 
<BR>
basis of any behavior in those laboratory animals.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Regarding Charles Murray, Dorfman writes:
<BR>
The second author of The Bell Curve, Charles Murray, has a doctorate in 
<BR>
political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is 
<BR>
currently a Bradley Fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, a 
<BR>
conservative research group in Washington, DC. Murray often publishes his 
<BR>
research and theories in The Public Interest (e.g., Murray, 1994), a 
<BR>
neoconservative magazine edited by Irving Kristol, also a fellow of the 
<BR>
American Enterprise Institute and sometimes considered the founding father 
<BR>
of neoconservatism (Atlas, 1995).
<BR>
<P>In an article recently published in The Public Interest, Murray listed the 
<BR>
first priority of his political agenda: &quot;And so I want to end welfare&quot; 
<BR>
(1994, p. 18). Inasmuch as the media sometimes refer to The Bell Curve as 
<BR>
Murray's book, perhaps the book represents Murray's summing up of a body of 
<BR>
objective scholarly research that he had published in scientific journals on 
<BR>
the genetic basis of IQ and poverty. But like his coauthor Richard 
<BR>
Herrnstein, Murray has never conducted or published any research in 
<BR>
scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ and poverty in his entire 
<BR>
career.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I thought some background information on the co-authors would be helpful.
<BR>
<P>The following paragraph I think sums up the point Murray and Herrnstein's 
<BR>
were trying to make with their book.
<BR>
<P>Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr. in his review of the book wrote:
<BR>
The notion of a meritocracy is not, in itself, an affront to American 
<BR>
sensibilities. Social scientists have carefully documented that social 
<BR>
mobility does occur from one generation to the next and that cognitive 
<BR>
ability is a major factor in determining whether an individual will achieve 
<BR>
greater or lesser social status than did his or her parents (Waller, 1971). 
<BR>
When each generation resorts in this way, the elements of fairness and 
<BR>
opportunity are preserved.
<BR>
<P>If, however, as The Bell Curve asserts, the heritability of IQ is quite high 
<BR>
and there is a strong tendency for those similar in ability to marry, there 
<BR>
will be less regression toward the mean in the cognitive ability of children 
<BR>
of the intellectually talented and, therefore, less intergenerational 
<BR>
reassortment.
<BR>
<P>Under these circumstances a meritocracy begins to look like an aristocracy, 
<BR>
a perception that is strongly reinforced when the intellectual elite 
<BR>
segregate themselves from the rest of society by living in separate 
<BR>
neighborhoods, sending their children to private schools, and supporting 
<BR>
social institutions that cater to their own unique interests.
<BR>
<P>The authors do argue that general cognitive ability (i.e., &quot;g&quot;) is a major 
<BR>
determiner of social status and that variance in general mental ability is 
<BR>
largely attributable to genetic factors--propositions that are certainly 
<BR>
endorsed by many experts in the field. The book explicitly disclaims, 
<BR>
however, that general mental ability is the only determinant of social 
<BR>
status, or that g is the sum total of an individual's social worth.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P><P>This is strong stuff!  I will requote the following:
<BR>
Under these circumstances a meritocracy begins to look like an aristocracy, 
<BR>
a perception that is strongly reinforced when the intellectual elite 
<BR>
segregate themselves from the rest of society by living in separate 
<BR>
neighborhoods, etc.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Very powerful and scary!  But is it true??  For the full document that has 
<BR>
