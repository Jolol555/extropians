<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the effect of medicine overall in the US, I point you to:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joseph P. Newhouse And The Insurance Experiment Group,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free For All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Harvard University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-674-31914-1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The book I cited is a summary of a 50M$ controlled experiment of 5000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people over 3-5 years where some where randomly given free health care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and others were instead given a small subsidy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Robin, was this a government funded &quot;experiment&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Those given free care incured ~30% more expenses, and yet had almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; identical health.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hmmmm, by that argument then, England should have a higher health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;care bill per capita than the U.S., yes?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  By &quot;free&quot; I meant as in paying for as much fee for service care
<BR>
as desired.  England is more like an HMO model, where its free but
<BR>
you can't have as much as you want.   The experiment also included
<BR>
an HMO type alternative, which also gave the same health outcomes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From the description you give, I would say this is a poor source to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use in debates regarding vaccines for the following reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't mean it to be regarding vaccines specifically.  I said it
<BR>
was regarding medicine overall.  It shows the health consequences of
<BR>
cutting back on 30% of health care spending.  If vaccines aren't part
<BR>
of that cutback, the experiment doesn't talk about them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;vaccines you have to look at the &quot;costs&quot; of those deaths and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degree to which they are prevented by vaccinations ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, of course.  The hard part is finding data you can believe about
<BR>
effectiveness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are going to look at Medical costs, I think you have to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at treatments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those treatments should be used.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course that is the ideal.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of
<BR>
medical procedures do not have support from randomized clinical trials.
<BR>
(Many of them in fact have mostly randomized trials against them.)
<BR>
And even given supporting randomized trials, you have to wonder how
<BR>
standard practice on typical patients differs from the best practice
<BR>
on most-likely-to-benefit patients found in the published trials.
<BR>
Given this, looking at overall effectiveness of medicine is informative.
