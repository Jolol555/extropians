<EM>&gt; What you're talking about is not analogous to the Thompson hack; what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're talking about is more like a compiler that would recognize *any*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compiler, even a compiler written for Pascal instead of C++, and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would furthermore refuse to compile anything that could be used as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spreadsheet.  I don't believe it can be done, even with limited AI.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Phrased that way, it sounds like a subset of the halting
<BR>
problem. Definitively Not Doable, without waving a magic wand.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, I'm not after a definitive solution; just a &quot;good
<BR>
enough&quot; one. I expect that general purpose molecular assemblers are
<BR>
going to be so difficult for non-transcendent beings to design that only
<BR>
a few specialist teams will do so. Moreover, network externalities (in
<BR>
the shape of a readily available pool of blueprints for useful
<BR>
artefacts, whether they are free or commercial) will tend to dictate
<BR>
that they're all programmed the same way, or in only a couple of different
<BR>
ways. (I hesitate to say &quot;language&quot; here because it's begging to be
<BR>
misinterpreted.) Which is why the job of recognizing your own source
<BR>
code isn't outrageously difficult. 
<BR>
<P>Look at C++, today. If you were the NSA and wanted to do the job, how
<BR>
many compilers would you need to compromise?
<BR>
<P>* Visual C++ (Microsoft)
<BR>
* Metrowerks Codewarrior (Motorola)
<BR>
* Gcc (Cygnus/Red Hat)
<BR>
* Borland C++ (Imprise/Corel)
<BR>
<P>That covers the four main compilers used on something like 90% of the
<BR>
machines out there. Moreover, they're the ones most budding C++ 
<BR>
programmers have access to. You could add specialist small fry like
<BR>
Watcom or the mainframe vendors, but by reducing the pool of unmonitored
<BR>
programmers by &gt;90% you've massively cut the risk of being hit by a 
<BR>
malicious program.
<BR>
<P>(And in today's control-freak-friendly political atmosphere, I can see
<BR>
calls for this sort of thing being listened to by legislators, halting
<BR>
problem or no.)
<BR>
<P>What I'd see as a payload for a Thompson hack on an assembler would be
<BR>
something a bit like a PC virus scanner: watch out for suspicious
<BR>
patterns of use (&quot;hey, that was the billionth plutonium atom I just
<BR>
stacked in that assembly! is he building a bomb, or what?&quot;) and snitch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What's more likely is that if Zyvex wants to sell more than one Anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Box, their Boxes will be programmed to build only those objects which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been signed with by Zyvex's public RSA key; which, of course, will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not include Anything Boxes.  Or submachine guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't buy one. I'd ask a friend to run me off a copy of his/her
<BR>
GNU assembler, which will build anything that can be authenticated by
<BR>
the author's public key as stored on a known keyserver.
<BR>
<P>How do I know that some disgrunted peon at Zyvex hasn't contaminated
<BR>
the source then signed it with their key? How do Zyvex prevent someone
<BR>
hacking their Anything Box, which is locked up using a method rather
<BR>
eerily reminiscent of the region-encoding CSS code in DVD?
<BR>
<P>The issue _here_ boils down to authentication and trust. I maintain
<BR>
that big corporate entities are not intrinsically more trustworthy than
<BR>
small fry like us, and that threats can come from unanticipated sources.
<BR>
<P>And I still think that the big growth industry in nanotech, once the
<BR>
first general assemblers come out, will be software (in the sense of
<BR>
design schemas and construction algorithms).
