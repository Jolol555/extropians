<EM>&gt; &gt; the police/national guard against the millions of legally armed folks in the

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well normally I would too but in this case the poorly armed masses have no

<EM>&gt; access to AWACS and it's brothers or the spy sat net or remote pilotless recon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There may be a few thousand night vision equipped survivalists but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your average Joe. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>These things are more useless than you might imagine when you consider 1)
<BR>
there is no easy way to discern friend from foe, since it is a domestic
<BR>
operation and the &quot;enemy&quot; is not composed of obvious military columns, and
<BR>
2) it would take a lot of resources to effectively monitor even a small
<BR>
region of the land that makes up the U.S.; many U.S. states are the size
<BR>
of European countries.
<BR>
<P>Also, if I had to guess a number based on various correlations and my own
<BR>
experience, I would estimate that there are around 250,000 private citizens
<BR>
in the U.S. whose equipment and training is as good or better than your
<BR>
average U.S. Infantry soldier today.  Realize also that most people in the
<BR>
military are REMFs (i.e. administrative and support personnel) and have
<BR>
very marginal combat capability.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, police units would get eaten alive in any real military
<BR>
action and are really only useful for herding mostly-unarmed civilians. 
<BR>
Interestingly, there have been a couple cases in recent U.S. history where
<BR>
civilian police units have engaged military units (too off-topic to go
<BR>
into here) and were quickly decimated.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Ammunition would be in short supply...surely to be targeted first by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ugly big brother. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ammunition would not run out unless there was a prolonged full-scale
<BR>
shooting war, and even then it is unlikely to be an issue.  Realize that
<BR>
U.S. shooters purchase *billions* of rounds of ammunition every year.  Not
<BR>
only that, but most gun owners I know have hundreds or thousands of rounds
<BR>
available at any given time.
<BR>
<P>If you take a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto uprising, it takes very few
<BR>
bullets to &quot;upgrade&quot; your weapons to whatever your oppressor is using.
