&lt;&lt;  Since I believe that the universe and everything in
<BR>
&nbsp;it exists for no reason but to serve my selfish interests, I
<BR>
&nbsp;consider it dishonest not to speak and act according to that
<BR>
&nbsp;belief.   &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Are you a sociopath?
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; I don't believe that's
<BR>
&nbsp;the case--evangelical religions are quite successful, for example.
<BR>
&nbsp;Why shouldn't my pulpit pounding be just as successful? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>No, because you are asking people to think for themselves.  This is a 
<BR>
paradox. You can't force someone to think for themselves. It's an oxymoron to 
<BR>
preach on it.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Politeness may be effective in some contexts,
<BR>
&nbsp;but it is clearly impotent in others.  Diversity works well in
<BR>
&nbsp;achieving success for living things, why not in communications
<BR>
&nbsp;as well?
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You raise very interesting points.
<BR>
&nbsp;First of all, you are quite correct, phony politeness and a &quot;need to be 
<BR>
liked&quot; are far more repugnant (to me) than sincere arrogance. And far more 
<BR>
dangerous and dishonest. 
<BR>
<P>Sincere empathy is a different matter. To walk in the moccasins.. so to 
<BR>
speak...
<BR>
<P>Second: 
<BR>
One can be sure of ones self - and contradict -  without unintentionally 
<BR>
insulting others. Without placing one's self above. Certainly ther are times 
<BR>
when yelling or insulting *is* the correct solution to a problem. Probably 
<BR>
not when you are tlaking about religion and other well-adapted protective 
<BR>
programming. 
<BR>
<P>I use the metaphor of - you have a pal who is involved with a woman who you 
<BR>
KNOW is lying to him (religion). You KNOW she is not good for him, and that 
<BR>
if he continues this way he will fall into ruin eventually. But he is still 
<BR>
smitten with her.
<BR>
How do you approach this? 
<BR>
If you attack her, you attack him. He loves her, she feels good, he has grown 
<BR>
attached and he has meshed with her. 
<BR>
How will you reach him, and allow him to see it for himself? By bashing her? 
<BR>
He'll punch you and walk away... By exposing her? He will blame his heartache 
<BR>
on you forever.. or fall into denial and shun you. 
<BR>
So... what you must do is not judge ( at least not out laoud) and stay in 
<BR>
touch, listen and respond - point things out that he may not see * in the 
<BR>
kindest possible, sympathetic way* and when he finally comes around (if he 
<BR>
does), never say &quot;I told you so&quot;.
<BR>
<P>We are talking about personal communiation skills.
<BR>
One my beefs is that *feeling* superior doesn't make you so. And people do 
<BR>
not respond well to hearing that they are infoerior, unless they are 
<BR>
masochistic, in which case they aren't there for rational discourse anyway. 
<BR>
<P>Emotions, are good tools. They give us clues to what we are actually 
<BR>
experiencing. 
<BR>
Experience is different from thought or talk.
<BR>
