<EM>&gt; However, when Greg Burch wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I've decided that a more systematic approach to concern about sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of opposition to our ideals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;goals is necessary.  To this end, I've begun work on a website in which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will collect links to groups and resources that appear to present a current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or potential threat to the transhumanist agenda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This gave me pause to reconsider. This is the Vice President of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropy Institute whom I assume has leadership support for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announcement.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, I don't get it.  Why is talking about threats, the simple
<BR>
common-sense fact that we're going to run into opposition, synonymous
<BR>
with elitism?  I agree that potential opposition should be tracked,
<BR>
although I don't believe that such lists should be published on the Web.
<BR>
&nbsp;I also believe that we should avoid apprising the potential opposition
<BR>
of our existence, which would kineticize their potential.  We should not
<BR>
directly oppose any who do not directly oppose us; we are not in the
<BR>
business of conducting subscription drives for Greenpeace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eliezer Yudkowsky in quite correct in his response to Robert Owen's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; note that we exist in a political environment. Of course. Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship between people is in the broadest sense political, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this different. Even so, it is unclear what the opposition is. Already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are buying into the program in many ways and values are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changing. All I can see is that some do not feel things are going fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough. This is &quot;youth&quot; talking.
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking on behalf of all youth, everywhere in the Universe, let me say
<BR>
that my four grandparents are alive, and I would very much like them to
<BR>
still be alive at such time as I finally take out Death.  If you wish
<BR>
that things were slower, be aware that you are wishing for one hundred
<BR>
and fifty thousand deaths for every day of delay.
