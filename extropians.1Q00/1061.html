<EM>&gt;  &gt; deriving the same benefit for less cost by mooching, clearly the wrong

<EM>&gt;  &gt; lesson to teach our young children.  The first two piggies should be eaten.

<P>Only until one recalls that eating little piggies is exactly what people
<BR>
do, even nice people.  The fact that carnivourous animals exist must
<BR>
be dealt with when teaching children.  One has the option of raising
<BR>
vegetarian children, an option which should be taken seriously.
<BR>
<P>Experience: I am acquainted with a bright child who had not, at the
<BR>
age of 5, been introduced to the concept of death.  She was raised
<BR>
vegetarian.  Her parents judged that it was not yet the time, and I,
<BR>
not wanting to question their judgement, played along.
<BR>
<P>One day, I showed her a seashell.  She asked where it came from.
<BR>
<P>I:  There are little sea animals that create shells such as these.
<BR>
<P>She:  Oh?  So, where is this little animal now?
<BR>
<P>I:  [stammering] uh, it, uh...I, uh...  Well, you know, sometimes
<BR>
little animals grow too large for their shells!  Then, of course,
<BR>
they move out!  And, uh, move into, uh, larger shells, that, uh,
<BR>
were moved out of by still larger animals!  heh heh...
<BR>
<P>She:  Oh?  So where are the larger animals that moved out
<BR>
of these larger shells?
<BR>
<P>I:  They... I...  [I switched my pager off and on, so that it
<BR>
beeped]  ooops!  Gotta run!
