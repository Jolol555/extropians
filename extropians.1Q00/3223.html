<P>-----------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P>2. MATERIALS SCIENCE:
<BR>
SILVER-BASED CRYSTALLINE NANOPARTICLES FABRICATED BY BACTERIA
<BR>
Heavy metal ions are usually toxic to biological systems,
<BR>
although certain heavy metal ions, in trace quantities, serve as
<BR>
enzymatic catalyst cofactors. Silver is highly toxic to most
<BR>
microbial cells and can be used as a biocide or antimicrobial
<BR>
agent. It has been reported, however, that several bacterial
<BR>
strains are silver-resistant and may even accumulate silver at
<BR>
the cell wall to as much as 25 percent of the dry weight biomass.
<BR>
... ... T. Klaus et al (4 authors at Uppsala University, SE)
<BR>
report the biological synthesis of silver-based crystals in a
<BR>
bacterial species, the authors making the following points:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The authors report the biosynthesis of silver-based
<BR>
single crystals with well-defined compositions and shapes, such
<BR>
as equilateral triangles and hexagons, in the bacterium
<BR>
Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259, a bacterial strain originally
<BR>
isolated from a silver mine. The crystals were up to 200
<BR>
nanometers in size and were often located at the cell poles.
<BR>
Electron microscopy, x-ray analysis, and electron diffraction
<BR>
studies established that the crystals comprise at least 3
<BR>
different types in both whole cells and thin sections.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) In contrast to many other metal-resistant bacteria, for
<BR>
which efflux of toxic ions is the main detoxification mechanism,
<BR>
the majority of the accumulated silver in P. stutzeri AG259 is
<BR>
deposited as particles in vacuole-like granules between the outer
<BR>
membrane and the plasma membrane (periplasmic space). X-ray
<BR>
analysis shows silver and sulfur in the proportion 2:1, thus
<BR>
suggesting Ag(sub2)S (silver sulfide). The electron diffraction
<BR>
pattern suggests acanthite, a stable crystalline form of silver
<BR>
sulfide. The authors suggest the formation of acanthite crystals
<BR>
may be caused by a reaction of silver particles with H(sub2)S gas
<BR>
produced by P. stutzeri.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The authors conclude: &quot;Metal-insulator composite
<BR>
materials have interesting optical and electrical properties that
<BR>
favor their application in microelectronics, for example, or as
<BR>
functional optical thin-film coatings. The possibility of
<BR>
synthesizing metal particles directly in an organic matrix points
<BR>
toward new uses of metal-containing bacteria as precursors in
<BR>
thin film and surface coating technology, for which a composite
<BR>
or *cermet structure can yield controlled optical, electrical,
<BR>
and other properties.&quot;

... ... *cermet structure: The term &quot;cermet&quot; refers to any of a
<BR>
group of composite materials made by mixing, pressing, and
<BR>
sintering CERamic with METal material.
