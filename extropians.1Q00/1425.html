<EM>&gt;Gregory Aharonian &lt;<A HREF="http://www.bustpatents.com/">http://www.bustpatents.com/</A>&gt; has a novel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea for using the stock market to make money attacking bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;patents.  The full article is at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;<A HREF="http://lwn.net/daily/patnews.html">http://lwn.net/daily/patnews.html</A>&gt;.  Here's an excerpt that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;describes that the basic idea...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ...is to find weak (portfolios of) patents for which, thanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to the craziness of the Internet, their assignee's stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  price is bubble-ish to the point of having a high price and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  volume (creating liquidity and volatility to exploit).
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;It is naive to think one can easily make money this way. Most software-
<BR>
related companies with high prices have high prices not because of their
<BR>
patents but because they provide good services and/or have created a good
<BR>
brand name (the few exceptions such as RSA have relatively secure patents).
<BR>
There have been some biotech companies recently where knowing in advance
<BR>
of an adverse patent ruling would have made you rich (e.g. VISX), but in
<BR>
most industries knowing that a company would have a patent declared invalid
<BR>
wouldn't be enough to make me comfortable betting against a company.
<BR>
&nbsp;Also, insider trading laws may pose a serious obstacle for this strategy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Let me propose a different strategy. Someone might be able to buy the
<BR>
patent affecting the GIF format from Unisys, and then demands outrageous
<BR>
royalties from companies that infringe on the patent unless they promise
<BR>
not to initiate any patent suits.
<BR>
&nbsp;This would require risking a lot of money (assuming Unisys would sell at
<BR>
all - an assumption which I don't know how to evaluate) with no clear
<BR>
reason to expect to get much return on investment. But if it could get
<BR>
started, it would almost certainly persuade some large companies that
<BR>
currently approve of software patents to switch to lobbying against them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I used to think that a similar strategy could be employed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against any company whose valuation is based on proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology which could be reengineered for substantially less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;money than the technology adds to the company's valuation:  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reengineer the technology in secret, short the stock, give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the technology away.  I'm quite skeptical of this idea now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because I think you'd need to create a perfect substitute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(bug-for-bug in software terms) and do lots of marketing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ensure your success, both of which require lots of capital. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Bug compatibility isn't very important.
<BR>
&nbsp;Marketing is a hard part of that strategy. If the primary goal of the
<BR>
company is to get rich shorting competitors, users will have good reason
<BR>
to doubt that the free software will be well maintained - the authors are
<BR>
almost promising to lose interest in it once the effect on the proprietary
<BR>
producer's stock is complete.
