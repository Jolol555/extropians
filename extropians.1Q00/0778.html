<EM>&gt; &gt; Subject: StockGeneration (was Re: [scam] $ pyramid scheme)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 13 months ago, when I heard of StockGeneration, I spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about 4 hours analyzing the game and its rules. I came to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the conclusion that it was very well designed, could last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a long time, and could make me a lot of money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I put in $6,000. I've taken out over $90,000 in cash. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; $664,000 left in my portfolio. I'm in a position to take out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about $20,000 per month.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why????
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What risk did you bear?
</EM><BR>
<P>I &quot;closed the risk window&quot; after about three months by
<BR>
taking out my original capital plus a modest profit. So I
<BR>
effectively bear no risk. I'm &quot;playing with the bank's
<BR>
money.&quot; (The $664,000 isn't completely mine, because
<BR>
the rules of the game are such that only relatively small
<BR>
portions of it can be withdrawn from time to time.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You can't get 10%+ risk-free returns when there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trillions of dollars in US debt being publicly traded fo 5.7-6.73% returns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Economies don't work that way.
</EM><BR>
<P>I presume you're talking about per annum returns. I've
<BR>
been &quot;spoilt&quot; by programs like StockGeneration to
<BR>
the point that I've become so greedy that I don't
<BR>
consider anything with a return of less than 10% per
<BR>
month!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The game is nonsustainable. What if the US government sold another $400b in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debt and put it into that game? What do you think would happen? You can bet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they wouldn't have $40b to pay the US government at the end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first month.
</EM><BR>
<P>My original analysis, 13 months ago, indicated
<BR>
sustainability. My subsequent experiences have
<BR>
bolstered my evaluation. SG is a very well designed
<BR>
game with some special rules that enable the principals
<BR>
to keep the game going. They can also change the
<BR>
rules whenever they like. The current maximum deposit
<BR>
is $30,000.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;risk&quot; you are bearing in this game is credit risk, which is huge. And,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fact, you're not getting any premium for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, having recovered my original capital
<BR>
plus hefty profits, I bear no risk whatsoever. Based on
<BR>
my initial capital of $6,000, this year I'll most likely
<BR>
average $20,000 per month in cash taken out, i.e.,
<BR>
over 300% per month!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You are very lucky to have made money on this. But tell me how this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different than a chain letter or the Albanian money pyramid scheme. Please.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gary Player was once told, &quot;Lucky shot!&quot; when he holed
<BR>
out from a bunker. He replied, &quot;And the more I practice,
<BR>
the luckier I get!&quot; During the past seven years, my ability
<BR>
to identify games like SG and win at the has improved a
<BR>
great deal. I'm also &quot;very lucky&quot; with several other programs!
<BR>
<P>SG is different in that they have some very sophisticated
<BR>
longevity-enhancing rules and formulas, and they utilize
<BR>
some of their capital for earnings that help pay the high
<BR>
returns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I spend MANY hours a day doing finance-related things. And I'm telling you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the people who solicit participants in this game can expect to go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jail.
</EM><BR>
<P>You probably operate in a certain culture of &quot;financial correctness.&quot;
<BR>
I think the risk of my going to jail for promoting SG is miniscule,
<BR>
particularly considering the complete legality of the game and the
<BR>
