<P>I don't know how much those of you else where, especially on the left coast,
<BR>
have heard about the landmark new domestic partners bill just passed by the
<BR>
Vermont Legislature. While the impetus was a State Supreme Court decision
<BR>
telling the legislature that the current marriage system discriminated against
<BR>
gays and lesbians by not giving equal protection i.e. the legal benefits of
<BR>
marriage, to the families of such people. The law that was passed established a
<BR>
'domestic partners' licensing system, which requires that such partners have all
<BR>
the legal benefits of marriage, but that such partnerships are not marriages, as
<BR>
the bill defines marriage specifically as that between a man and a woman. One of
<BR>
the things that they also put in the bill that hasn't been mentioned much is
<BR>
that not only can gays and lesbians apply for domestic partnerships, but any two
<BR>
family members (i.e. brother &amp; sister, father &amp; daughter, mother &amp; son,
<BR>
brothers, uncle &amp; nephew, etc) can also register as domestic partners, so that
<BR>
employees can have such family members covered by insurance, etc..
<BR>
<P>The thing that I'm surprised about this is that there haven't been any jokes out
<BR>
of Hollywood about the apparent legalization of incest this seems to
<BR>
endorse...especially since its coming from a state like Vermont.
