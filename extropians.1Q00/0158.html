<EM>&gt; &gt;right now, we are taking intersex

<EM>&gt; &gt;children and forcibly rendering them into one of two established 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gender schemas.  That trend belies any possibility of greater

<EM>&gt; &gt;expression and freedom for voluntary enhancements.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This worries me. My impression is that intersex phenotypes are basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developmental *errors*. They are not emergent wonderous mutant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternatives. Not even the starting point for a viable parallel community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like deaf or dwarfed people. Do we decline to intervene with hydrocephalic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; babies, on the grounds that it's mere prejudice against Greys that makes us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normalize the vast-headed?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are taking Kathryn's &quot;intersex&quot; term in a more literal
<BR>
sense than she intended it.  Making some generalizations, I think
<BR>
Kathryn and I are looking at opposite sides of the same coin while
<BR>
agreeing that we can see the other side.  I move that we have to
<BR>
know where we are before we know where we can go (from a genetic
<BR>
standpoint), while I think Kathryn moves that we are at a point where
<BR>
children are born with a lot of freedom with regard to the gender
<BR>
roles they choose but they are stuck with sterotypes of parents and
<BR>
societies.  These are both valid foundations to move forward from
<BR>
and we will probably need both to construct a building.
<BR>
<P>Putting a cap on the genetic side of things, nature is rather
<BR>
ruthless with discards in the process of coming up with superior
<BR>
forms.  Presumably when we are doing this consciously and/or with
<BR>
social engineering we can be a little bit less gruesome about it.
<BR>
The trick will be to balance the need for progress with &quot;acceptable
<BR>
risk&quot;.  A lot of the time you aren't going to know if something
<BR>
works until you actually try it.
