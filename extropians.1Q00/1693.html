From: &quot;Steven M. Bellovin&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:smb@research.att.com?Subject=Re:%20can%20the%20government%20require%20your%20keys?&In-Reply-To=&lt;xxx20000128191151.71AF141F16@SIGABA.research.att.com&gt;">smb@research.att.com</A>&gt;

<P>Something that's been debated endlessly on the net is whether or not the (U.S.)
<BR>
government can compel someone someone to turn over their keys.  Some 
<BR>
(including lawyers) have said yes, on the grounds that a key is 
<BR>
non-testimonial.  Others (again, including lawyers) have pointed out that a 
<BR>
key may not be testimonial, but that a defendant's knowledge of it is, and 
<BR>
that the key is therefore covered by the Fifth Amendment protection against 
<BR>
self-incrimination.  There's now a new wrinkle.
<BR>
<P>According to an article in the NY Times CyberLaw Journal (see 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/01/cyber/cyberlaw/28law.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/01/cyber/cyberlaw/28law.html</A>), the 
<BR>
issue arose during the Mitnick case.  However, rather than demanding the key 
<BR>
under penalty of a contempt citation, the prosecutors declined to turn the 
<BR>
encrypted files over to the defense team.  Although Rule 16 of the Federal 
<BR>
Rules of Criminal Procedure require the government to turn over documents that 
<BR>
&quot;were obtained from or belong to the defendant&quot;, the prosecutor argued that 
<BR>
the government didn't really possess the files, since they couldn't read them. 
<BR>
They further claimed that the files might have illegally-obtained information 
<BR>
or &quot;for all we know, it could be plans to take down a computer system.&quot;  The 
<BR>
information &quot;might be dangerous&quot;; it was likened to a defendant asking for a 
<BR>
coat back without the government knowing if there was a pistol in the pocket.
<BR>
<P>The judge sided with the prosecutors.  Unfortunately, the ruling probably 
<BR>
can't be appealed at this point, given the plea bargain.  But it will come up 
<BR>
again; the Clinton administration is apparently planning on introducing a bill 
<BR>
on access to keys.
