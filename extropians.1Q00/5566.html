<P>I wouldn't want to have been _anything_ in Sparta.  Remember the old story
<BR>
about a Spartan boy who had stolen an animal (dog? wolf?) and was questioned
<BR>
but released because they could not proof him stealing the animal. After the
<BR>
guy(s) left the boy fell down dead, because he had concealed the animal in
<BR>
his clothes and the animal had bitten him fatally during the questioning,
<BR>
and he could not cry out.  This was seen as good behaviour by Spartans.
<BR>
Humans don't cry.
