You could have these as crude and shallow undersea habitats too.
<BR>
Remember the extensible inflatable tunnels near the end of
<BR>
Stephenson's _The Diamond Age_? With this you could have cylinders or
<BR>
domes grown from the bottom-up in stages. If the tops are airtight,
<BR>
you could capture gas liberated by electrolysis. I doubt you could
<BR>
actually produce breathable atmosphere, but it might do for fiction.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, this is definitely something I had planned on using. A very
</EM><BR>
nice
<BR>
<EM>&gt; idea, and probably necessary for setting up the basic framework on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which to build the rest of the sea construction. Possibly it could
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; done using conducting polymers made by modified bacteria or plants,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powered by solar cells. Hmm, maybe islet farms in the tropics, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the constructions grow until ready to be seeded with more biotech
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually harvested and sold to the highest bidder...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;       I assume any Chinese Civil War will involve action against
</EM><BR>
Taiwan at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some point. Without serious collapse of American military prowess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; naval action among People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), US Navy,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Taiwanese forces seems reasonable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few million? Good Lord, what do they use for transports? That makes
<BR>
the Miracle at Dunkirk look like recreational boating. How long does
<BR>
this last? A year? Two? Remember to study seasonal storms, Anders.
<BR>
There might be really nasty weather effects on the evacuation. (That's
<BR>
a euphemism for vast loss of human life.) It might be interesting if
<BR>
they're towing icebergs from the growing glaciers from the polar
<BR>
regions for both drinking water and for cheap limited-use hulls.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, the real problem is a few million refugees (just a few
</EM><BR>
millions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; because the others didn't get boats in time). This kind of ships (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rafts) may play a significant role in the evacuation. At this point
</EM><BR>
(I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; put the civil war at 2014) biotech is not yet as good as later on
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the national states are still forces to be reconed with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Any side involved might use this technique to produce cheap hulls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for &quot;Liberty Ships&quot; or low magnetic signature mines. If your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scenario has vessels using screws for propulsion then they remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vulnerable to entangling wires.  Reinforcing such traps with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; electrodeposition might make them more effective. On the other
</EM><BR>
hand,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I suspect magnetohydrodynamic propulsion would prove very
</EM><BR>
sensitive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to changes in the gross electrical properties of its working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fluid. Perhaps salting (no pun intended) the sea lanes with plants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that release this material would damage or slow MHD-propelled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vessels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe a defensive water hyacinth? Especially designed to accumulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; iron filings so that when it passes through the MHD it does real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damage...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;       If naval action plays a role in your next SF scenario, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like to make further suggestions off list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have not planned much of that, but I gladly listen to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestions. It is this kind of ideas and extrapolations I really
</EM><BR>
want
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to add in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the weekend I will send you some ideas about future naval
<BR>
warfare. If there's interest, I'll send them here, but I think they're
<BR>
pretty far from extropian themes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At the start of the scenario my players will be dealing with the
</EM><BR>
local
<BR>
<EM>&gt; politics of the Republic of Sichuan, but I expect the focus to move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out globally after a while.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're welcome, Anders. That review helped lead to some piecework
<BR>
assignments for a sci-fi RPG set for GEN CON 2000 release.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, I think I never thanked you properly for your RPG-net review of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BIGV. Thank you! I think it was right on spot, and mentioned a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things I will try to fix in new versions.
