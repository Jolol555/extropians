Lee Daniel Crocker says:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Better to start briefing John McCain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I saw where McCain took a shot at Falwell, Robertson and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sharpton today.  I may hafta vote for him.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Better to go with the dems, who never pandered to the religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's true; they generally pander to the green gestapo and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the liberal mush-heads.  I'm not sure who's worse: Christian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundies or Enviro-fundies.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Yuck.  Puke. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure which is worse, the evil torturer who beats me with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cat o' nine tails, or the one who kicks me in the kidneys with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;steel-toed boot.   Gee, the cat o' nine tails sure smarts, but the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;boot does more long-term damage.  Guess I'll go with the cat.
<BR>
<P>I'm devoting zero cycles to figuring out which is worse.  Anybody,
<BR>
from any party who thinks it's acceptable to have a war on drugs
<BR>
throwing millions of people into prison (all of the major candidates),
<BR>
who thinks it's acceptable to steal people's income as tax to fund
<BR>
unnecessary expenditures (yes, like trips to Mars, for God's sake, or
<BR>
acting as the world's policeman, or fighting the accursed drug war in
<BR>
Colombia, or whatever, i.e. all of the major candidates), who opposes
<BR>
gun rights, or abortion rights, or who believes in censorship, or who
<BR>
wants to &quot;defend marriage&quot; by forbidding homosexuals from doing it, or
<BR>
who wants to &quot;save Social Security&quot; with my money, or who wants to
<BR>
regulate international trade, or keep immigrants out, does not deserve
<BR>
your vote or my vote.
<BR>
<P>I cannot in good conscience vote for tyrants or thieves, and neither
<BR>
should you.  And don't tell me about the lesser of two evils, how the
<BR>
wronge lizard might win, as Douglas Adams might say.
<BR>
<P>In the game of divide and conquer, the divided do not win.  The
<BR>
conquerors win.  Don't play that game, unless you want to be a
<BR>
conqueror.  
<BR>
<P>All the best!
<BR>
James
<BR>
<P>P.S. Who wins the election will make very little difference.  The
<BR>
system is carefully set up that way.  But it will be Gore, because the
<BR>
economy's doing well.  When the economy's going ok, the incumbent or
<BR>
sitting veep win.  You can bet on it.
