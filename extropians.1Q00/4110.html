<EM>&gt; Even more important and fundamental is to define the components of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propositions being made. In terms of the existence of qualia, we must,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BEFORE anything else, define both existence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and qualia. We have defined qualia many times, so I won't bore you again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not existence. This, like a great many other commonly used words is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumed defined, the existence of a coherent symbolic counterpart in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minds being the source of the assumption. But these symbols, useful to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animal within us, are far from dependable when working with pure logic. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, they don't have to have any counterpart in reality at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The failure of certain people to acknowledge the above leads to
</EM><BR>
propositions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; such as &quot;Qualia does not exist&quot;. Well, my definition for entities that
</EM><BR>
exist
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is those entities I can perceive through my senses either directly or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indirectly. I know of no other definition. Given this, it is irrational to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propose that qualia do not &quot;exist&quot;, since we all directly perceive them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could go on all day, but the points I'd make I've already posted several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times to no effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Got any comments folks? Any alternative definitions of existence? From
</EM><BR>
here
<BR>
<EM>&gt; we can begin a real debate - not from ten miles down a line of highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questionable personal assumptions as is usually the case. Take out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ambiguity from the bottom up, and then you'll see former matters of
</EM><BR>
opinion
<BR>
<EM>&gt; become matters of fact, and real progress on issues can be made, avoiding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;who's got the biggest golden hat?&quot; game that humans seem incapable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoiding even when engaged in supposed rational debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no read all of this thread, but the problem with Rob Harris'
<BR>
definition of &quot;existence&quot; is that it makes it utterly dependent on
<BR>
consciousness.  (It's pretty close to Berkeley's saying that for
<BR>
NON-spiritual beings, &quot;to be is to be perceived.&quot;)  This would limit
<BR>
existence to only those things which one can perceive or infer from sense
<BR>
perception.  I call this the positivist fallacy...
<BR>
<P>Now, I _agree_ that to know something exists, one must perceive it or
<BR>
somehow infer it from sense perception, but knowledge [of existence!  What
<BR>
else is there to have knowledge of?:)] is not the same as existence.
<BR>
<P>What is my definition of &quot;existence&quot;?  I don't offer one.  Instead, I accept
<BR>
Rand's view that existence is an axiomatic concept -- any attempt to define
<BR>
it results in a circular definition, any attempt to deny it assumes it.
<BR>
<P>In this context, though, to have an experience does mean something exists.
<BR>
I had a dream or several last night.  As dreams, they existed and I
<BR>
perceived them.  Yet, they did not, as far as I can tell, refer to any
<BR>
reality external to me.  The same is true, e.g., when one presses one's
<BR>
closed eyes and sees all sorts of colors.  These colors are the result of
<BR>
pressure and _exist_ in the sense that one experiences them, but they do not
<BR>
correspond to the color of the space one is in.  (Most of this kind of
<BR>
confusion, anyway, is the result of making judgments based on perception.
<BR>
The mirage illusion does not mean that the mirage as a mirage does not
<BR>
exist.  Instead, one's confusion of that perception with water (say, a lake)
<BR>
is where the problem lies.)
<BR>
<P>Hopefully still existing as you read this,:)
