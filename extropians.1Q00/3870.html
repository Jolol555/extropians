It appears as if somebody wrote:

<BR>
|[...] Au is NOT the
<BR>
|standard in dental materials.  It was... 50 years ago, but believe it or not, 
<BR>
|dental technology has actually significantly advanced since 1950!  And your 
<BR>
|quote, 'the polymer doesn't age well'.  I, like most dentists, have been 
<BR>
|using polymers for years and years, and I would choose a polymer restorative 
<BR>
|way over dental gold, or amalgams anytime.

<P>The author of the above statement might indeed have installed polymer fillings,
<BR>
and they may indeed have worked well for the recipients of the fillings.
<BR>
<P>I have tried out polymer fillings myself, and they have never ``survived'' for
<BR>
a longer time than one year.  After that time they simply fell out... 
<BR>
<P>To arrive to the conclusion that polymer fillings work for all humans seems
<BR>
rather premature to me.
