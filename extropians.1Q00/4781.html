Lately I've been thinking that the period between the Franco-Prussian
<BR>
War and WWI might have some lessons for the current time, in many ways.  
<BR>
That was also a long period of relative peace in the relations of the &quot;Great 
<BR>
Powers&quot;, and was also increasingly seen by contemporaries as a kind of 
<BR>
Golden(or &quot;Gilded&quot;) Age (see Twain's writings).  However, it seems that the 
<BR>
military and geopolitical predominance of the US is greater now than that 
<BR>
enjoyed by the UK in that period.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I do think we are in a sort of golden age.  'Pax Americana' is now in force 
<BR>
and god forbid any nation get in the way of our economic and political 
<BR>
interest.  Isn't neo-colonialism great when you're the one on top? ;)
<BR>
<P>I hope the analogy does not hold up in the sense that by the mid 21st 
<BR>
century we will see an age of horrifying conflict.  'Down and out' former 
<BR>
great powers like China, Russia and India are hungry to play catch-up with 
<BR>
the United States and Europe.  How long will that take(if ever) and when it 
<BR>
happens what will they want from us??

One of the main characteristics of these kinds of vehicles is their 
<BR>
significantly lower cost than current- and next-generation manned fighter 
<BR>
aircraft, since they 1) don't have to carry pilot-support systems and 2) can 
<BR>
be built with much lower service-life expectations in terms of numbers of 
<BR>
hours of total system operation.  They also have significantly enlarged 
<BR>
flight and tactical envelopes, since they don't have to be constrained by 
<BR>
the limit of g-forces a human can survive and can be risked in threat 
<BR>
environments much more dangerous than those to which a modern democracy will 
<BR>
expose the lives of their fliers.

<P>I remember how Arthur C. Clarke predicted such warcraft in his book _2019_ 
<BR>
which came out in the mid-eighties I believe.  Of course, I am sure long 
<BR>
before that these aircraft had been conceived of.  My question is, could the 
<BR>
software and hardware of a drone really equal the flying skills of a gifted 
<BR>
and experienced human pilot?  I suppose it could come close, and by not 
<BR>
being constrained by the limits of having a human on board, be much 
<BR>
deadlier.
<BR>
<P>Whatever happened to so-called 'anti-gravity technology?'  I remember seeing 
<BR>
old newsreels showing researchers flying several feet of the ground on what 
<BR>
I thought were devices that projected strong magnetic fields.  Where is this 
<BR>
research now?
<BR>
<P>If this were perfected I could see the navy becoming airbourne with aircraft 
<BR>
carriers taking after the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier which Nick Fury sometimes 
<BR>
lead his striketeam's from.  Now that would impress the neighbors!  And 
<BR>
could you imagine the bomb tonnage you could drop on someone with such 
<BR>
craft?

The point of this digression is that the military think-tank establishment 
<BR>
is already developing a mind-set that could evolve into one adaptable to 
<BR>
&quot;nano-war&quot;: The factors described above in connection with anticipation of a 
<BR>
strategic and tactical environment characterized by a tiered deployment of 
<BR>
increasingly autonomous and smaller and smaller munitions seems capable of 
<BR>
evolving into the ultimate development of &quot;robo-warfare&quot; at the molecular 
<BR>
scale.

<BR>
<P>The present military mindset of the pentagon does seem to be very forward 
<BR>
looking.  I know they love to write reports about 'war in 2020' a great 
<BR>
deal!  The military has had a fascination with pilot-less weapon platforms 
<BR>
for awhile and now the tech is getting here to makes such things a reality.  
<BR>
Go Bolo!  For the glory of the Corps!! :)  I also see a natural process 
<BR>
going on that will ultimately lead to nano-warfare.  And I am sure the 
<BR>
pentagon already has reports written on the big picture! lol
