</EM><BR>
<P>I think he was pointing out that we have a stable situation currently
<BR>
and why the global-warming camp is a bit excessive.  As Daniel points
<BR>
out it may be a separate thread.  I'm sure people are aware that
<BR>
from a nanotech standpoint putting the CO2 into the atmosphere is
<BR>
good.  However that doesn't diminish the problems it may produce.
<BR>
The question is how to tax the Chinese to provide money for people in
<BR>
places like the Maldives and Bahamas to literally &quot;uplift&quot; themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The actual instabilities now being theorized are much greater than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was once thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely.  So it remains unclear whether the extinction events rollback
<BR>
the evolutionary clocks, drive the development vectors in different
<BR>
directions (e.g. a freeze-tolerant bacteria branch and an environmental
<BR>
extreme archea branch), or would function to accelerate overall
<BR>
evolution by generating more genetic nano-machines and faster
<BR>
ways of recombining them to generate diversity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My only reason for bringing up this work was to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show that life has survived through some pretty serious sh*t here on Earth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which gives me hope it has done so elsewhere.

Interestingly, last weeks issue of Nature has two relevant articles.

<P>The basic results suggest that evolutionary recovery of diversity from
<BR>
extinction events has a lag of ~10 million years.  The event takes
<BR>
species back to a level where certain generalists survive, then as they
<BR>
evolve into the unfilled niches, they in turn create new niches
<BR>
that other species may diversify into.  Another way of looking at
<BR>
this is that diversity breeds diversity or complexity promotes
<BR>
complexity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This still doesn't mean there are lots of sentients out there, and I fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Great Silence attests to their nonexistence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
If communication between intelligent species breeds similarity
<BR>
by providing for similar knowledge bases with regard to the
<BR>
physical laws, what is known &amp; knowable, optimal computing
<BR>
architectures, etc. then it would be unecological and perhaps immoral
<BR>
*to* communicate.  Short-circuiting a natural developmental path by
<BR>
uplifting a sentient species prematurely may simply be a wrong
<BR>
thing to do.  The reasons most humans allow their children to
<BR>
discover that Santa Claus may not exist or that we don't teach
<BR>
children prematurely about various aspects of sex is that there
<BR>
are some things that it is better to discover oneself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prove me wrong!  Please!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm working on it.  Patience please, its a very uphill battle.
