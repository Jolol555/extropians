<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>Civil Liberties Groups Say New Encryption Export
<BR>
Regulations Still Have Serious Constitutional Deficiencies
<BR>
<P>Washington, DC -- Leading Internet civil liberties groups said today
<BR>
that new encryption export regulations released by the U.S. Commerce
<BR>
Department fall short of the Clinton Administration's promise to
<BR>
deregulate the privacy-enhancing technology.  The American Civil
<BR>
Liberties Union (ACLU), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
<BR>
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) will continue to press
<BR>
their Constitutional cases.  These court cases seek to eliminate U.S.
<BR>
government regulations that make Internet encryption software and
<BR>
technology more cumbersome to publish or send than the same items when
<BR>
published in other media.
<BR>
<P>While the Administration has taken a step in the right direction with
<BR>
its latest revisions, the fundamental constitutional defects of the
<BR>
encryption export regime have not been remedied.  Specifically:
<BR>
<P>- The new regulations, like the old ones, impose special requirements on
<BR>
Internet speech, contrary to the Supreme Court's 1997 ruling in Reno v.
<BR>
ACLU.  The regulations require that the government be notified of any
<BR>
electronic &quot;export&quot; of publicly available encryption source code, and
<BR>
prohibit electronic &quot;export&quot; to certain countries.  Yet people may
<BR>
freely send the same information anywhere on paper.
<BR>
<P>- The export regulations are still a completely discretionary licensing
<BR>
scheme.  They continue to require licenses for a large amount of
<BR>
communication protected by the First Amendment, including transmitting
<BR>
source code that is not &quot;publicly available,&quot; source code that is
<BR>
&quot;restricted,&quot; source code forming an &quot;open cryptographic interface,&quot; and
<BR>
various forms of object code.
<BR>
<P>- While the new regulations appear to permit free posting of encryption
<BR>
source code to Internet discussion lists, such posting may be illegal if
<BR>
the poster has 'reason to know' that it will be read by a person in one
<BR>
of the seven regulated countries (such as Cuba).
<BR>
<P>- The new regulations still ban providing information on how to create
<BR>
or use some encryption technology as prohibited &quot;technical assistance.&quot;
<BR>
Software publishers can be fined or imprisoned for helping people to use
<BR>
their code.  These same limitations do not apply to non-encryption
<BR>
source code.
<BR>
<P>The U.S. export control laws on encryption have been the source of much
<BR>
legal wrangling for the past several years.  Encryption is a method for
<BR>
scrambling data in order to make electronic communications more secure.
<BR>
<P>As more computer users employ encryption to protect the privacy of their
<BR>
e-messages and documents, the U.S. government has until now demanded
<BR>
guaranteed easy access to the content of Internet communications.
<BR>
<P>In a well-publicized court case, mathematician Daniel J.  Bernstein has
<BR>
challenged the export control laws on encryption on First Amendment
<BR>
grounds. Professor Bernstein claims that his right to publish his own
<BR>
encryption software and share his research results with others over the
<BR>
Internet is being unconstitutionally restricted by the government's
<BR>
controls.  Bernstein won his case at the trial level, and won an appeal
<BR>
in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  The government asked that the
<BR>
appeal be reconsidered in light of the new regulations, and a larger &quot;en
<BR>
banc&quot; panel of Ninth Circuit judges will reconsider the case this
<BR>
spring.
<BR>
<P>A similar case challenging the Constitutionality of the export rules was
<BR>
brought by the ACLU of Ohio on behalf of Ohio law professor Peter
<BR>
Junger, who wished to publish an electronic version of an encryption
<BR>
program he wrote.  The case is pending in the Sixth Circuit Federal
<BR>
Court of Appeals.
<BR>
<P>Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director for the ACLU, said, &quot;The rules are
<BR>
a step forward, but they are still too complex and leave too many
<BR>
questions unanswered.  Now that the Administration has tacitly admitted
<BR>
that it can't and shouldn't control the use of encryption, it should
<BR>
have announced a simple deregulation, rather than regulatory maze.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;These First Amendment problems need to be fixed before we can support
<BR>
the government here,&quot; commented EFF attorney Shari Steele. &quot;The
<BR>
government has made some concessions, but they are not enough to make
<BR>
the regulations constitutional.  EFF will continue to support Professor
<BR>
Bernstein as he presses on with his litigation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>According to EPIC General Counsel David Sobel, &quot;The revised rules will
<BR>
make it easier for commercial firms to export and sell encryption
<BR>
products.  While that is a positive development, the government will
<BR>
still retain significant control over this technology, to the detriment
<BR>
of efforts to create a truly secure Internet.  It's time to remove the
<BR>
bureaucratic requirements and permit the free exchange of encryption&quot;
<BR>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (<A HREF="http://www.aclu.org">http://www.aclu.org</A>) is the nation's
<BR>
largest and oldest civil liberties organization. In its defense of the
<BR>
principles of the Bill of Rights, it advocates for both free speech and
<BR>
privacy rights.
<BR>
<P>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.eff.org">http://www.eff.org</A>) is a leading
<BR>
global nonprofit organization linking technical architectures with legal
<BR>
frameworks to support the rights of individuals in an open society.
<BR>
Founded in 1990, EFF actively encourages and challenges industry and
<BR>
government to support free expression, privacy, and openness in the
<BR>
information society. EFF maintains one of the most-linked-to Web sites
<BR>
in the world.
<BR>
<P>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (<A HREF="http://www.epic.org">http://www.epic.org</A>) is a
<BR>
non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, DC.
<BR>
It was established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging civil
<BR>
liberties issues and to protect privacy, the First Amendment, and
<BR>
constitutional values in emerging communications media.
