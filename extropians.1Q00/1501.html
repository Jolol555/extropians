<EM>&gt;That is what we say, isn't it? You evidently disdain this conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;metaphorical description and express the physical situation in a much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sophisticated manner. I'm sure you luxuriate in a fantasy about how others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are impressed with your acumen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What impresses me are your coarse manners and the extent to which your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-importance is based on a pompous assumption that you have somehow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;managed to transform trivial platitudes into profundities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I apologize to the list for this exasperated statement, but I simply cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tolerate the sheer loutishness and incivility exhibited here by this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supercilious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;young man.

<P>Robert, I suggest you relax and give Shaun a break. Shaun is one of the 
<BR>
most pleasant, considerate, and downright sweet-hearted fellows on this 
<BR>
list and has been for years before you joined the list. I can see what it 
<BR>
was in his post that set you off, but I think you're misinterpreting his 
<BR>
attitude completely and being very harsh on him. (Unless Shaun has had a 
<BR>
total personality transplant in the last day or two!) I think the number of 
<BR>
insults you've packed in the above to Shaun more than compensates for any 
<BR>
perceived shortcoming in his means of expression, which I'm quite sure does 
<BR>
not represent his intention.
