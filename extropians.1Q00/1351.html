<EM>&gt; Nanomedicine Nears the Clinic By David Voss
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe I've commented briefly previously that I thought this
<BR>
article was a fair amount of fluff and didn't cover the
<BR>
important stuff (like the publication of Nanomedicine).
<BR>
<P>As I recall, I've informed the editors about my thoughts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I haven't yet read these but one quick note: the opening blurb for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second piece says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Ray Kurzweil created a hubbub with his idea that we will soon be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     able to &quot;download&quot; ourselves into machines and live forever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even in an MIT publication the notion of uploading (here misnamed) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically credited to Kurzweil.  There's really no excuse.  Whatever the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, he---and uploading---are certainly receiving more and more attention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the time.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've also commented to the editors of T.R. that they showed a gross
<BR>
lack of knowledge in the area by not acknowledging Moravec and Minsky.
<BR>
There is nothing in anything re: Kurzweil that I've read that indicates
<BR>
that he invented &quot;uploading&quot; (rather than simply promoted it).  While
<BR>
this is distinctly possible, proper scientific etiquette should make
<BR>
things clear.  Minsky has informed me directly (in private conversation)
<BR>
that it appears he *and* Moravec invented separate concepts of uploading
<BR>
independently.  I haven't seem the same admission from Kurzweil.
<BR>
<P>Now, just as a private note of personal experience, Ray, dropped in on
<BR>
my discussion of &quot;The Limits to Intelligence&quot; at the last Foresight
<BR>
Senior Associates gathering (where I was trying to present Matrioshka
<BR>
Brains in a limited form), he offered one comment that seemed fairly
<BR>
out of context and then disappeared.  { Of course his impression,
<BR>
perhaps valid, is that I may not have understood the relevance of
<BR>
his comment. }
<BR>
<P>While I acknowledge the good Ray is doing in promoting the idea of
<BR>
uploading, I'm somewhat angst-ized as to whether or not he is attributing
<BR>
it properly.
<BR>
<P>I try to make very clear in my &quot;Reading List&quot; page what sources
<BR>
I have read, so if I recreate something previously invented, people
<BR>
can backtrack it.
