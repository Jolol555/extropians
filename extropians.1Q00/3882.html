<EM>&gt; Actually, it seems fairly realistic to me.  You build the factories for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fixed amount, which is most of your cost right there, then run them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 24/7 without worrying about amortization, marketing, shareholder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebellions, the maximum competitive pricing, and so on.  That's 75% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your marginal cost blown away right there, and the fixed cost can either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be written off as charity, or paid back in 20 years by the grateful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recipients... or &quot;paid on&quot; when *your* country winds up a little behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the tech contest.
</EM><BR>
<P>PC manufacturers have been trying to undercut each other's prices for years
<BR>
now, so I don't see any reason to think a charity will be able to beat their
<BR>
cost of production by all that much (and it might not beat them at all,
<BR>
since it wouldn't have the same competitive pressures and institutional
<BR>
experience).  Being nonprofit exempts you from only a modest fraction of the
<BR>
expenses a private company would pay (mostly taxes).  You still have rent,
<BR>
payroll, distribution, material costs, etc.
<BR>
<P>Looking for a modest savings might make sense, but reducing the cost of the
<BR>
whole PC + wireless connection + power source setup by an order of magnitude
<BR>
is unreasonable.  If it was actually feasible, I'd think someone would be
<BR>
doing it already.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The primary appeal of the scheme, to me, is the idea of dropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions of easily concealable ringtop computers onto oppressed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries, as Marc Stiegler proposed in _Earthweb_.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can understand that, but I'm a little skeptical about it.  Most of the
<BR>
people in the most urgent need of help can't read, let alone use a
<BR>
computer - and they don't speak English, Japanese or any European language,
<BR>
either, so there isn't a lot of content they could use anyway.
<BR>
<P>I could see it as a way to destabilize an oppressive government in a
<BR>
half-developed country like Malaysia or Pakistan, but I'm not sure it would
<BR>
do much to improve the local economy.
