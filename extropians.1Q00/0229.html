<P>
<EM>&gt; Hal Finney
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I realize that this is pretty fuzzy in terms of specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prescriptions for action in the real world.  I don't claim to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully fleshed out philosophy here; these are ideas which I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exploring and offering for consideration.  It has long seemed to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the traditional mode of discourse, argument and rebuttal, is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very successful.  I believe we have seen mostly failures in our own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debates here.  We are much more successful when we are working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cooperatively, brainstorming together, bouncing ideas off one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another.  I would like to see us find a way to bring this kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approach into a larger arena.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes; I'm lacking specifics for prescriptions and a seamless
<BR>
perspective as well; I think that many of us are.  And we know that
<BR>
in every moment the singularity comes a little closer and we are not
<BR>
prepared.
<BR>
<P>Something needs to be done, clearly.  But I'm not entirely sure if
<BR>
there is a fatal problem in the structure of traditional debate.  The
<BR>
problem probably lies in the medium or in the channels by which
<BR>
debates may be productive.  I suspect that our debates often fail,
<BR>
drag on, or go in circles because there is little structure to them.
<BR>
Greater structure in debates and general organization of resources
<BR>
would serve to bind the community as one with common purposes; along
<BR>
the way it would probably accomplish some of the things that people
<BR>
might expect of the near-nascent transhumanist/Extropian political or
<BR>
media spinoffs.
<BR>
<P>You cannot expect a method to work if it is not properly applied.
<BR>
Political debates, for a timely example, operate within the realm of
<BR>
established political power structures and therefore accomplish very
<BR>
little or nothing.  But even entirely earnest debates---such as those
<BR>
on this list---can easily fail for any number of reasons.  This list
<BR>
lacks the features of a formal journal or academic community which are
<BR>
supposed to maintain coherence, context, and quality in discourse.
<BR>
<P>Lee Daniel Crocker offered back in September a prescription for useful
<BR>
debate, which didn't seem to attract much attention despite the fact
<BR>
that it was one of the few recent explicit statements of the sort.
<BR>
(And despite the fact that it was in response to a call for formal
<BR>
debate.)  During the recent &quot;patents&quot; discussion Robin remarked:
<BR>
&quot;Behold, the great cycle of email, where the only way to kill one
<BR>
flamefest favorite (qualia), is to introduce another (e.g., patents).&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Flamefesting&quot; is clearly not intrinsic to the nature of debate.
<BR>
<P>I'll try to informally name a few problems, expressed in negative
<BR>
terms, from which extended discussions on this list may suffer.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of topic statements
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to know what one is discussing one must have a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;clear statement of the contention.  Often an observation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or question becomes a major point of debate but is too
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;monolithic or ill-defined for precise discussion.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of position statements
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be difficult to know who, exactly, thinks what when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone is posting and crossposting to different messages.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is this inconvenient, it results in redundant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;postings, difficulty in seeing how many different positions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are represented, and poor goal orientation (see).
<BR>
<P>- Lack of exterior context
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Topics, points of argument, and positions should include
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adequate reference to and understanding of developments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the rest of the world.  The Extropy list is obviously
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not the first place that things get discussed; it serves
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;no purpose to duplicate arguments already held in public
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forums.  If posters are unfamiliar with previous work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;references and summaries can be offered.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of goal orientation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our debates should have some concrete results.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Papers are published in journals to make knowledge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;available for further research.  There doesn't seem to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be many noticeable effects of many of the discussions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;here even when the participants are clearly begging for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;them.  Part of the reason for the recent expression of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;desire for greater public exposure, I think, is that our
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;interaction, which we all enjoy and which has great
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;potential, often does not result in action.  Bouncing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas around is very important.  Bouncing ideas around,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bouncing them so that they don't get stuck on the roof,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and throwing them purposefully at the target is better.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of topic management
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Topics can shift within messages; digressions can take over
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;discussions---it is important to maintain focus on the main
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;points of contention.  I love digressions but they do not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;always serve the goals of a debate.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of thread management
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When topics do change (in general) the subject lines of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;posts should change.  As Eliezer puts it in a specification
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for a mailing list, &quot;One of the things I really hated about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Extropians list was missing some great discussion of tech
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because it grew out of &quot;VEGI: Should turnips be illegal?&quot;&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, subject lines are not always maintained
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exactly as originally written.  Large and small variations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sneak in so that posts with common origins get listed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;separately in the archives.  It helps to spell the subject
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;properly at least so those variations don't have to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;corrections.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of message text formatting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of general netiquette falls in this category: 80-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;character or less formatting of text; unambiguous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attributions; minimal quotation of previous messages;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;minimal or no nested quotations or attributions; et cetera.
<BR>
<P>- Lack of moderation and review
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boards of competent moderators and reviewers are certainly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fallible.  We must assume, however, that individual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;posters are more so.  Most or all of the above deficiencies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;could be ameliorated by application of some sort of rule-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;based structure and moderation.
<BR>
<P>List members could endeavor to modify their strategies; other locations
<BR>
(_The Transhumanist_, _The Journal of Transhumanism_, et cetera and,
<BR>
of course, new publications and sites) could act not just as forums for
<BR>
discussion but as centers for transhumanist ideas, news, and information
<BR>
in general.
