<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What database?  Where can I see it for myself.  If as you say, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;undeniable&quot; then I won't deny it.  I doubt however that there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;proven&quot; and &quot;undeniable&quot; evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;FBI Database of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not even remotely close to &quot;undeniable.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Better than any other source. Show me anything more credible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't mean that the FBI Database of Crime Statistics was not credible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, for the purpose of this discussion, I'll concede that if its in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FBI Database of Crime Statistics, its true.  What I meant was that I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that there is anything in the FBI Database of Crime Statistics which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports your claims.  If I'm wrong, show me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure everyone knows that crime has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; been steadily decreasing recently.  *Nothing* I have ever seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;attributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; this trend to the large number of guns circulating in society.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; want to check out what the National Center for Policy Analysis has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;say on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; this count.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s229/s229.html">http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s229/s229.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The NCPA is an avowed leftist socialist anti-gun lobbying group. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;woulnd't know the truth if it slapped them with a wet noodle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are the type of person who debates an issue by castigating those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hold opposing view points, this debate will not get very far.  You will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far more likely to convince me by showing that any facts asserted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NCPA are false than you will by simply calling them names.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I can also retort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;against criminals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As to the need for such cartoons, suit yourself.  As for the words
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be trying to put in my mouth, I never said, or suggested, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You quite vehemently supported the same for the opposition. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one way, don't support the other..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You misinterpreted my comment.  What I said was &quot;As to the need for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; cartoons, suit yourself.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;NO, you said the following, on Sun, 12 Mar 2000 19:42:40 PST:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;endquote&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Therefore, you were arguing in support of more cartoons. Stopy lying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You simply don't get it.  Try to re-read the earlier exchange one more time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Maybe take a deep breath first.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your statement was a clear request if it is possible that there could be
<BR>
enough of thise hateful propaganda. It was a rhetorical statement that
<BR>
clearly exposes your position to anyone who knows anything about
<BR>
rhetoric and debate. You lied, plain and simple. If you can't admit it,
<BR>
then there isn't much use going on here. I will accept that you might
<BR>
have forgotten what you had said earlier, as it is possible for people
<BR>
without consistent thought patterns to forget such clear statements....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Do you get bothered when people catch you in a lie?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very much so.  So far you have yet to bother me at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Do you really want to continue?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only if you can turn down the posturing and the rhetoric and turn up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; facts and a *reasonable* debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I didn't start it, you did. I'm all for reasonable debate. Just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, just the facts, huh?  Lets start with your claim that the FBI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Database
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995, somehow supports your assertion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;guns are what keeps (sic) as many people in this country in circulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.&quot;  And that this assertion is, in your own words, &quot;Proven fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; undeniable.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where *exactly* can any such &quot;facts&quot; be gleaned from the FBI Database of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995?  Reference to web page would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The only analysis done of ALL statistics in the database done was by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago. He found the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;following, based completely on the statistics:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a) For every 1% increase in the number of citizens with Concealed Carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;permits, crime drops by an average of 1%.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;b) The death penalty, as it is currently administered, has no positive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or negative effect on the crime rate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;c) Violent crime drops by an average of 8% one year after a state passes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a 'shall-issue' reform of its concealed carry statues (versus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;discretionary issue statutes).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;d) Spree type killings (more than one murder per incident) drop by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;average of 80% within 5 years of passage of such concealed carry laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;he found a bunch of other things out, but these are the most salient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;points. Read his book, _More Guns, Less Crime_ before you dismiss this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So when you *said* &quot;FBI Database of Crime Statistics&quot; what you *meant* was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _More Guns, Less Crime_?
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is the only broadly accepted, complete analysis of the FBI
<BR>
Database of Crime Statistics ever done with regard to gun control laws.
<BR>
The anti-gunners have not been able to disprove any of his conclusions
<BR>
with their own study. The best they can do is cherry pick 5 (count em:
<BR>
5) counties in the US where their claims held up for short periods, and
<BR>
those abberrations John Lott has shown were entirely due to single
<BR>
crimes (spree killings).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I don't suppose you would agree that John Lott is an avowed right-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pro-gun lobbyist who wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him with a wet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noodle?
</EM><BR>
<P>According to him, he was anti-gun generally until he did the study.
