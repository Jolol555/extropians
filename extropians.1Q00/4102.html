<EM>&gt;H. G. Wells had to be at least a great proto-extropian. He didn't talk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal immortality, but perhaps he lived at too early a time for that. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most of the other ideas are there. I wonder how many people he influenced?

<P>Don: I also find that scene deeply stirring. You might be interested to 
<BR>
know that you can find the dialogue you quoted at the back of the very 
<BR>
first issue of Extropy magazine (the paper edition in 1998).
<BR>
<P>The problem with Wells was that he seemed to be a bit of a technocrat--in 
<BR>
the sense that he thought a scientific elite should run things for the 
<BR>
citizens. It's been a long time since I read any Wells, so maybe I'm being 
<BR>
unfair to him (someone please correct me if so). He seems quite extropian 
<BR>
expect in that my impression was that he looked down on the masses (the 
<BR>
lumpen-proletariat as the Leninists would say) as incapable of creating 
<BR>
their own future. Aside from that, he gave a powerful message of humanist 
<BR>
and technological optimism.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
