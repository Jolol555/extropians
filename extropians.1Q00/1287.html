Well, the Japanese are supposed to be working on an Awomb.  And
<BR>
of course NIH and most Western countries keep pushing back the
<BR>
envelope for premies.  This will be helped by the genome(s) since
<BR>
we could study mice or some other species to better determine
<BR>
any late genetic switches that are getting flipped and make sure
<BR>
that externally they get flipped as well.
<BR>
<P>I suspect the &quot;Bclock&quot; for women (if you are refering to those
<BR>
late-20's/early-30's &quot;urges&quot;), will be subtle.  It might be
<BR>
entirely psychological.  Or it could be a hormone, similar
<BR>
to Leptin (triggering sexual maturation), or the currently MIA
<BR>
signals regarding fat reserves and the regulation of body temp.
<BR>
If so its going to be tricky to find and will probably show
<BR>
up as an orphan hormone that someone gets lucky discovering its
<BR>
the Bclock timer.
<BR>
<P>Infertility is going to die the death of a thousand cuts.  They
<BR>
will keep working on it until they discover piece by piece what
<BR>
is broken and how to fix it or work-around it.  The genome helps
<BR>
here to since genotyping could let you spot broken fertilization
<BR>
processes or incompatible gene sets.  But this is going to take
<BR>
many years for all the correlation studies to trickle in.
<BR>
<P>Overall, I'd say within 10 years you will be looking at a very different
<BR>
playing field. In 20, having babies the &quot;natural&quot; way will start
<BR>
being a hot topic of debate -- (why risk the lives of the mother
<BR>
and child?, etc.).
<BR>
<P>Now, also in 10 years you should probably be able to do Aeggs and
<BR>
Asperm; which seems silly when you can do A-human-proto-cell.
<BR>
So, Eugene will not object, I'll simply point out that you don't
<BR>
have to understand the genes to copy them from a working genome
<BR>
blueprint.  How much genome reduction you can get away with (which
<BR>
relates to cost as I discussed at Extro3), will depend on how much
<BR>
we understand regarding gene function at that time.  I haven't
<BR>
worked out the numbers yet, but I strongly suspect that if
<BR>
this is even moderately popular, the costs would be significantly
<BR>
below costs for IVF today.
<BR>
<P>Real designer babies are going to take the off-the-shelf &quot;brains&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;health&quot; and bodies/looks (pick your favorite model or actor)
<BR>
and then &quot;tweek&quot; them so they have some fraction of the parent's
<BR>
genes and looks.  The real discussions will revolve around whether
<BR>
you want a child thats 70% you or 30% you.
