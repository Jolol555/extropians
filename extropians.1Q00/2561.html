<P>
I would like to tell people who may not know this,
<BR>
that every single one of them appeared in the world
<BR>
as a result of sex, and so did their kids and parents,
<BR>
and that each of these people has genitals physically
<BR>
attached to them at all times.  This doesn't offend
<BR>
anybody; neither does it offend any young of any species
<BR>
to see any sex or nudity - let alone symbolic references
<BR>
to existence of sex and genitals that everybody is
<BR>
already aware of - until they are brainwashed by the
<BR>
conservatives.  And as always, in the conservative
<BR>
ideology, those who might break the boundaries and
<BR>
lead the children away, are called &quot;Perverted Corruptors
<BR>
of the Young&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Young&quot; are much more interested, and open, to experiments,
<BR>
than older people.  If older people try to play with your enhanced
<BR>
genitalia (or brains, anything else) behind the cowardly closed
<BR>
doors, the youngsters will take over the tools, do a lot more
<BR>
in the open, and let the old farts - those hating the change as
<BR>
well as those secretly playing with it - rot in their respective
<BR>
closets.
<BR>
<P>This always happens.  Millions of kids readily embrace new freedoms,
<BR>
music, entertainment, drugs, technology, etc.  Separation of the
<BR>
adults just splits the society.  You can't possibly chalenge your
<BR>
young more than they challenge themselves.   You can just lose
<BR>
your last chances to connect to them, understand the new wave,
<BR>
and pass something of your own.  The paranoid &quot;protection of the
<BR>
young&quot; in U.S. just strengthens this schitzophrenic social separation.
<BR>
<P>It more and more looks to me that people over 30 can still develop
<BR>
some useful technology, but are - with the rarest exceptions - 
<BR>
unable to take advatage of it.  It's not the life extension,
<BR>
or health, or enhancements.  Millions of 40 year olds who were
<BR>
supposedly struggling for freedom in the communist world - or
<BR>
anywhere else - still have enough health to dance techno, play
<BR>
videogames, experiment with sexual roles, lead anarchist 
<BR>
movements and otherwise push all envelopes - and show the way
<BR>
to their children.   How many of them do?  And how many of those
<BR>
who do just engage in verbal fantasies, and hide even symbolic
<BR>
references to things from the young, &quot;to protect them&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Do your young masturbate?  Do you not talk to them about it?
<BR>
To protect them?  From what?!
<BR>
<P>You have to start taking real steps and real risks to break
<BR>
the boundaries, or you will be among the majority of old farts
<BR>
who will just fertilize the soil for the next generation -
<BR>
and not the easy soil to grow on...
