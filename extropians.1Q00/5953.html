This is always true of visionary proposals, whether by science fiction
<BR>
writers or people named Seward. What characterizes the late twentieth and
<BR>
early twenty-first century is a remarkable falling back from the dreams of
<BR>
the Apollo decades (post World War 2). We're waiting for something to happen
<BR>
before we make the next leap, and I believe this something is a convincing
<BR>
model not just for economics in space, but for maintaining biological
<BR>
processes in space (one and the same thing, in my view!).
<BR>
<P>A lot of people--many of them friends--are working hard to lower costs to
<BR>
orbit. NEO is already a proven money maker for some. But as Joe Carroll
<BR>
pointed out, we haven't done the complete closed loop habitat experiments
<BR>
necessary to convince anybody that we can survive for a couple of years in
<BR>
space without help from Earth. This is the biological equivalent of cutting
<BR>
lose from suppliers of venture capital; breaking even, paying off debts, or
<BR>
making a profit!
<BR>
<P>When the culture as a whole is presented with convincing evidence for
<BR>
solutions to these hard practicalities, the visionaries will be back in
<BR>
favor.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes!

<P>Someday space really will be ready to make a profit on.  When
<BR>
people like us approach funders (private and public) to suggest
<BR>
projects, will they reply &quot;that's what you science fiction sorts
<BR>
have been saying for over X decades; you've been dead wrong
<BR>
so far, so why should we believe you now&quot;?  Fooling funders into
<BR>
paying for profitless things now may cost us real big later,
<BR>
when it really counts.
