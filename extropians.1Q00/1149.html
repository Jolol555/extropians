<EM>&gt; &quot;Unique and valuable&quot; to whom? It could be argued that the arrangement of

<EM>&gt; those molecules that make up the Mona Lisa or the Declaration of Independence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no more unique and valuable than the information content of a rock, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more appropriately a person-made rock.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are merging distinctly different things.  The *essence* of the
<BR>
argument is the degree of information content that can be meaningfully
<BR>
interpreted by someone with regard to how far it is from random &quot;stuff&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Natural rocks, even in their many possible molecular configurations
<BR>
have significantly less information content than the M.L. or D.o.I.
<BR>
because to specify the information content of the latter you also
<BR>
have to specify (in some way) the information content (perspective?)
<BR>
of the creator *and* the individuals who can *interpret* the creation.
<BR>
The rock's type and distribution of molecules can be described highly
<BR>
accurately and there is probably only a very *limited* amount of additional
<BR>
information (e.g. the history of its formation) that can be determined
<BR>
from that.  The M.L./D.o.I. on the other hand can have volumes written
<BR>
about what went into them and the impact(s) they have had on other information
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>Unless you can make an argument that that is true for the rock as
<BR>
well, I believe your statement to be inaccurate.  (While you could
<BR>
&quot;invent&quot; a system in which the person-made Rock did have the value
<BR>
of the M.L. or D.o.I., said system doesn't exist currently and as a
<BR>
result I would say that the uniqueness and value of the rock is less.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is your &quot;interpretation&quot; that assigns value and the quality of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uniqueness to the information contained in those structures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who's to say that my interpretation of the Mona Lisa as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piece of junk (not my actual belief) is any &quot;better&quot; than yours?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is the degree of separation from simply random organizations
<BR>
of molecules (and perhaps the driving power to create new non-random
<BR>
molecular organizations) that determines the &quot;value&quot; and &quot;quality&quot;.
<BR>
That is the entire basis behind extropianism.  Random stuff sucks.
<BR>
Its simply noise.  Non-random stuff, particularly that created with
<BR>
some intention behind it (and which may create further intentions
<BR>
and non-random stuff) is the alter where we worship (figuratively
<BR>
speaking of course... :-))
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a physics standpoint, you have to argue that the rock has
</EM><BR>
greater negentropy than the Mona Lisa.  If the rock were created
<BR>
to serve as evidence that it came from Mars and demonstrated
<BR>
the existence of life on Mars a billion years ago, then I might
<BR>
grant the case, but if its trying to pass as an ordinary hunk
<BR>
of granite, I would disagree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only information value of a zygote is its genome.  A human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I might be splitting hairs here, but I think that statement is far too bold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is plenty of &quot;informational value&quot; associated with the structures that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comprise the zygote outside of just its genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>These are minimal in nature.
<BR>
<P>[Scientific Analysis Mode &quot;On&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>The development of a &quot;human&quot; is a standard genetic program.   The parental
<BR>
polymorphisms and imprinting provide probably 90+% of the &quot;individuality&quot;
<BR>
with the remainder being a small amount of stochastic variation.  There is
<BR>
little additional information provided in the physical maturation process.
<BR>
A small number of &quot;bits&quot; can say whether or not cell 2,121,937,203 &quot;exists&quot;.
<BR>
The *real* differences only begin to occur when you start accumulating bits of
<BR>
experience in every day life.
<BR>
<P>Lets say that your genome has 3 billion bases of DNA, each of which is
<BR>
2 bits (1 in 4 possibilities) of information.  But (conservatively) 90%
<BR>
of that is junk, so now you are down to 600 million bits (perhaps 75
<BR>
megabytes).  But most of this is just &quot;standard&quot; human biochemistry
<BR>
(if you don't get it right, you don't live), so what you really need
<BR>
is the &quot;differences&quot; between you and a generic human.  We will say
<BR>
thats a factor of 1 in 100 (this seems to make sense, since this would
<BR>
easily allow 20 or more mutations per gene (of ~2000 bases) which seems
<BR>
very generous), so now your &quot;unique&quot; information is down to around 750
<BR>
KBytes.  By today's standards that isn't very much &quot;unique&quot; information.
<BR>
Even if you have to multiply it by one or two orders of magnitude to
<BR>
account for the affects of the cells you &quot;have&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; it still isn't
<BR>
very much information.  [Its worth noting that you should not be tracking
<BR>
the actual cells you have or lost, but the *difference* that makes in the
<BR>
overall functioning of the organism.]
<BR>
<P>Now, lets say you are up to around 100 MB of information for you as
<BR>
a &quot;physical&quot; being.  According to Xenology (from other sources),
<BR>
your eyes alone process 500 KB/sec.
<BR>
<P>So in about 3 minutes (assuming scene changes on a per second
<BR>
basis) your external &quot;data&quot; input matches the information content
<BR>
of your body at birth.  IMO, its no contest.
<BR>
<P>[Scientific Analysis Mode &quot;off&quot;.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, where do you draw the line and for what application of the rules within a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system? Is the person that you were yesterday &quot;less of a human being&quot; than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are today?
</EM><BR>
<P>If they are running in a &quot;rut&quot;, perhaps the answer is yes.  From an
<BR>
entropic viewpoint, given using the energy to generate lots of new
<BR>
information vs. simply re-running the same old patterns, the obvious
<BR>
answer is vote for the new and interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Where do children fit along the continuum, not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other species that are significantly related humans?
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends entirely on the degree to which they are generating
<BR>
organized information.  Children do this highly effectively.
<BR>
You could have two very different but interesting figures of
<BR>
merit.  &quot;Absolute organized information&quot; and the 1st derivative
<BR>
&quot;rate of change of organized information&quot;.  Both have high valuations
<BR>
depending on the context.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; What is the *objective*  criteria that can be used to lay down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threshhold line that says: On this side you are not &quot;human&quot; and over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this side you are?
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't do this and &quot;human&quot; is irrelevant.  What matters is the
<BR>
information content.  In that respect, offing a highly creative,
<BR>
even &quot;brilliant&quot; pig for dinner may be much more questionable than
<BR>
putting a very low IQ human permanently to sleep.  Assume for the
<BR>
sake of argument that the calories going to feed one could be used
<BR>
to feed the other and what you are interested in is maximization of
<BR>
overall intelligence (and side effects) on the planet.  Look at
<BR>
the overall impact of not eating the pig if he gets a spot on Jay
<BR>
Leno that convinces millions of people to become vegetarians overnight!
<BR>
Compare that to the impact the human would have had on net negentropy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think this issue is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot more complicated than your summary posting would indicate. Hence the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controversy associated with abortion, animal rights, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with this.  The issue is very complicated and but to my
<BR>
thinking it is due to the *huge* difference between the
<BR>
information content of genomes and minds that is unrecognized
<BR>
by most.
