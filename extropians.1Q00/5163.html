<EM>&gt; &gt; What stumbles occured with nuclear power? Even counting Chernobyl (more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a result of socialism than nuclear technology) and the two bombs dropped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on Japan there are still fewer people killed by nuclear technology in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its entire history than are killed every year by the pollution of coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; burning technology, and coal burning plants put more radioactive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; materials into the environment every day than the entire US nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; industry has released in its history. While some countries are shutting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; down their nuclear plants, they are increasing output at their coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plants, and are buring lower quality coal than ever before. China burns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; coal for most of its capacity that is so dirty that it would be criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to burn here in the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tightly reasoned, Michael; would you agree that what is needed is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly increased funding for research aimed at BOTH non-nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AND non-combustible energy generation that was cost-effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and bio-safe?
</EM><BR>
<P>If the technology fits within the current economic range of cost effectiveness,
<BR>
yes. Making people switch from an energy source that costs $0.05 per kWh to a
<BR>
source that costs $0.50 per kWh is not only just cruel, but its very stupid and
<BR>
causes actually MORE pollution in the end. (experienced energy analyst here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the meantime, I am inclined to agree with you that an objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk-benefit comparative analysis of our current leading technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggests a rational preference for nuclear power.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats the problem, isn't it? Expecting people to be rational.
