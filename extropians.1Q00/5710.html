<P><EM>&gt; Brent and John have gone around on why ETs don't help us and why

<EM>&gt; evil (be it cancer, starvation, dictators, etc.) is allowed to exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I have commented before, I think you *really* have a scale
<BR>
or context problem that has to be taken into account.  It is
<BR>
hardly likely (unless you are Buddhist), that when sweeping
<BR>
out the cobwebs in the corner of your house and sucking up
<BR>
a spider into your vacuum cleaner, you view yourself a an
<BR>
evil-doer the likes of Stalin or Hitler.  But from the spider's
<BR>
perspective you have just destroyed his home you evil slimeball
<BR>
you.  Over a lifetime, you probably destroy the homes of
<BR>
thousands of bugs of various kinds (and let us not discuss
<BR>
eating meat or chiken or fish...).  Join the ranks of the
<BR>
mass murderers.
<BR>
<P>The problem is you are applying human perceptions of what is
<BR>
good or evil to creatures that have a totally different context
<BR>
and agenda.  If, you are of a mind that values species
<BR>
diversity, as has been discussed in other threads, then you
<BR>
are of a mind that &quot;evolution&quot; is good, that *death* is good,
<BR>
because without death, you have no way of selecting for the
<BR>
better genes that allow the evolutionary clock to slowly lift
<BR>
us up out of chaos and drive back the evil entropy.
<BR>
<P>If you argue, that the ETs should save us from evil, then you should
<BR>
*also* argue that when we have the capabilities, *we* should uplift
<BR>
and make immortal every creature on the planet.  And since we would
<BR>
have the capabilities, lets also uplift the plants while we are at it.
<BR>
Then since everything would be (relatively) immortal, we would have to
<BR>
stop all evolution as soon as we hit the material and energy resources
<BR>
(*very* quickly).  The only way out of this that I can see, would be for
<BR>
uplifted people/animals/plants to &quot;discover&quot; that they are unworthy and
<BR>
choose to commit suicide so their resources can be reused
<BR>
by the evolutionary lottery to take someone/something to the
<BR>
next level.
<BR>
<P>It is unclear to me what this would buy you over slowly letting
<BR>
the natural process of evolution occur.  If the ETs don't disturb
<BR>
us it is because the natural process of evolution works.
<BR>
<P>If the authors of &quot;Rare Earth&quot; are correct, and higher life-forms
<BR>
are rare, then it is no suprise that the machinery of evolution,
<BR>
that some of us view as evil, is allowed to persist.  As they
<BR>
put it:
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;A big fence surrounds our solar system: &quot;Earth Intergalactic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Park.  Posted: No trespassing or tampering.  THe only planet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with animals for the next 5000 light-years.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The value of what some view as evil, to those observing may well be
<BR>
incalculable.
