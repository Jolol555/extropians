</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zubrin has clearly done his homework and clearly makes a valid case for
</EM><BR>
Mars
<BR>
<EM>&gt; being perhaps the first place we should go on a long term &quot;occupation&quot;
</EM><BR>
basis.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; However(!), he seems unaware of (or avoids) two key areas: AI and
</EM><BR>
Nanotech.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He mentions nanotechnology once in the book, classifying it with other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;wishful&quot; technologies such as Faster-than-Light travel (Oooppps...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI is also avoided, so it isn't clear whether or not he has thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very seriously about Moore's Law.  Since he discusses terraforming Mars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over 100-1000 years, he doesn't seem to have much awareness of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity.  Biotech is mentioned only in passing.  Thats the bad news.
</EM><BR>
<P>Coincidentally I just heard a talk by Zubrin on Sunday, and &quot;The Case for
<BR>
Mars&quot; is in my bag for a scan on the redeye home tonight.    A key theme of
<BR>
Zubrin's is the need to talk about and promote the Mars mission effort as a
<BR>
near-term vision - do-able with &gt;available&lt;, well-understood technology -
<BR>
hence eliminating the need (though not the desire) for advanced but
<BR>
currently nonexistant or infant technologies such as AI or (more so)
<BR>
nanotech.
<BR>
<P>He presented Mars as a near-term need for two reasons that I caught.  First,
<BR>
political expediency:  if government resources such as NASA are to be
<BR>
involved, they need a deadline, and since they're politically driven the
<BR>
deadline has to be one that's meaningful in the current political context -
<BR>
in other words, one such that the current (at project start time)
<BR>
administration will still be in power when the project bears fruit.
<BR>
<P>His other thesis was a bit more controversial and provocative: we need to go
<BR>
to Mars now - or soon - as a challenge, as a response to those who've
<BR>
claimed recently that, for example, we're living at the &quot;end of history&quot; or
<BR>
the &quot;end of science&quot;.   We need a human presence on Mars to do real
<BR>
exploration - not only of the Martian physical environment itself, but of
<BR>
what will eventally form a new human culture - people living off the land
<BR>
off of Earth, facing challenges that we haven't considered yet, and taking
<BR>
the human civilization to the next step.   The controversy that came up in
<BR>
the question session afterward was whether or not we need to go to Mars,
<BR>
specifically, to make that sort of advancement and combat stasis that way.
<BR>
<P>Looks to be an interesting read.
