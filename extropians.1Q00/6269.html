&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SYMPOSIUM AT STANFORD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- free and open to the public --
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, April 1, from 1 PM till 5:30 PM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching Center, Science and Engineering Quad (TCSEQ), room 200
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near the Math Corner, Sequoia Hall, and the Varian Physics Building
<BR>
<P>rimary speakers:
<BR>
<P>ay Kurzweil (inventor of reading machine for the blind, electronic
<BR>
eyboards, etc., and author of &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;)
<BR>
<P>ans Moravec (founder of Carnegie-Mellon University's Robotics Institute,
<BR>
nd author of &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind&quot;)
<BR>
<P>ill Joy (co-founder of, and chief scientist at, SUN Microsystems)
<BR>
ohn Holland (inventor of genetic algorithms, and artificial-life
<BR>
pioneer; professor of computer science and psychology at the U. of Michigan)
<BR>
<P>anel members:
<BR>
<P>alph Merkle (well-known computer scientist and one of today's top figures
<BR>
n the explosive field of nanotechnology)
<BR>
<P>evin Kelly (editor at &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and author of &quot;Out of Control&quot;,
<BR>
&nbsp;study of bio-technological hybrids)
<BR>
<P>rank Drake (distinguished radio-astronomer and head of the SETI
<BR>
Institute -- Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)
<BR>
<P>John Koza (inventor of genetic programming, a rapidly expanding branch of
<BR>
rtificial intelligence)
<BR>
<P>Symposium organizer and panel moderator:
<BR>
<P>ouglas Hofstadter (professor of cognitive science at Indiana; author of
<BR>
G-del, Escher, Bach&quot;, &quot;Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies&quot;, etc.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, two distinguished computer scientists, Ray Kurzweil and Hans
<BR>
Moravec, came out independently with serious books that proclaimed that in
<BR>
the coming century, our own computational technology, marching to the
<BR>
exponential drum of Moore's Law and more general laws of bootstrapping,
<BR>
leapfrogging, positive-feedback progress, will outstrip us intellectually
<BR>
and spiritually, becoming not only deeply creative but deeply emotive, thus
<BR>
usurping from us humans our self-appointed position as &quot;the highest product
<BR>
of evolution&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two books (and several others that appeared at about the same
<BR>
time) are not the works of crackpots; they have been reviewed at the
<BR>
highest levels of the nation's press, and often very favorably. But the
<BR>
scenarios they paint are surrealistic, science-fiction-like, and often
<BR>
shocking.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Kurzweil and Moravec, today's human researchers, drawing
<BR>
on emerging research areas such as artificial life, artificial
<BR>
intelligence, nanotechnology, virtual reality, genetic algorithms, genetic
<BR>
programming, and optical, DNA, and quantum computing (as well as other
<BR>
areas that have not yet been dreamt of), are striving, perhaps unwittingly,
<BR>
to render themselves obsolete -- and in this strange endeavor, they are
<BR>
being aided and abetted by the very entities that would replace them (and
<BR>
you and me):  superpowerful computers that are relentlessly becoming tinier
<BR>
and tinier and faster and faster, month after month after month.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will it all lead?  Will we soon pass the spiritual baton to
<BR>
software minds that will swim in virtual realities of a thousand sorts that
<BR>
we cannot even begin to imagine?  Will uploading and downloading of full
<BR>
minds onto the Web become a commonplace?  Will thinking take place at
<BR>
silicon speeds, millions of times greater than carbon speeds? Will our
<BR>
children -- or perhaps our grandchildren -- be the last generation to
<BR>
experience &quot;the human condition&quot;?  Will immortality take over from
<BR>
mortality?  Will personalities blur and merge and interpenetrate as the
<BR>
need for biological bodies and brains recedes into the past?  What is to
<BR>
come?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To treat these disorienting themes with the seriousness they deserve
<BR>
at the dawn of the new millennium, cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter
<BR>
has drawn together a blue-ribbon panel of experts in all the areas
<BR>
concerned, including the authors of the two books cited.  On Saturday,
<BR>
April 1 (take the date as you will), three main speakers and five
<BR>
additional panelists will publicly discuss and debate what the
<BR>
computational and technological future holds for humanity.  The forum will
<BR>
be held from 1 PM till 5:30 PM, and audience participation will be welcome
<BR>
in the final third of the program.
