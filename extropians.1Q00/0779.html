<EM>&gt;A while back we had some discussion of the Doomsday principle, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;says that a randomly chosen person is likely to be about halfway in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the lifetime of the human race (ordered by birth date), and hence if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think of ourselves as randomly chosen this applies to us.  Given that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the human race is growing exponentially, it follows that we likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be near the end of the human race, chronologically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The same principle applies to other phenomena which have exponential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;growth, such as fads.  By the time the typical person first hears of them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the fad is likely to have just about run its course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the case of StockGeneration, although there have apparently been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who invested years ago and made good money, the typical person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who invests will be near the end of the curve (assuming rapid growth).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That means us.  Now that we have heard of it, the site will probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cease operations before long.

<P>According to SG, they currently have about 150,000 accounts.
<BR>
Because of poor customer service and bandwidth constraints --
<BR>
most of the time access to their website is difficult -- their growth
<BR>
is unlikely to be much greater than 5,000 new accounts per month.
<BR>
<P>I always operate on the basis that a program like SG could be
<BR>
gone tomorrow -- as I've indicated in another post, I &quot;close the
<BR>
risk window&quot; as soon as appropriate.
<BR>
<P>The probability may be good that SG will be around for another
<BR>
year or two.
