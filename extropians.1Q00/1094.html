<P>
<EM>&gt; That is a repugnant and self-congratulatory statement.  It is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing that makes people shun &quot;rational&quot; thought. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting issue--do such attitudes really dissuade
<BR>
people from rationality?  I do understand that it is somewhat
<BR>
anti-social in our current culture, and that's something I hope
<BR>
to change.  Since I believe that the universe and everything in
<BR>
it exists for no reason but to serve my selfish interests, I
<BR>
consider it dishonest not to speak and act according to that
<BR>
belief.  I am as repulsed by unthinking politeness and displays
<BR>
of unearned respect as you seem to be by my calculated arrogance.
<BR>
<P>But if it is really true that such arrogance causes people to
<BR>
flee from ideas expressed that way, perhaps I am not effectively
<BR>
serving my selfish interests by doing so.  I don't believe that's
<BR>
the case--evangelical religions are quite successful, for example.
<BR>
Why shouldn't my pulpit pounding be just as successful?  And even
<BR>
if some large number of people are indeed turned off by it, is
<BR>
there not room multiple messengers with different styles to
<BR>
different people?  Politeness may be effective in some contexts,
<BR>
but it is clearly impotent in others.  Diversity works well in
<BR>
achieving success for living things, why not in communications
<BR>
as well?
