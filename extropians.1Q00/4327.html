<P>
<EM>&gt;How about just plain old satisfaction of curiousity.
</EM><BR>
<P>How does the introduction of the idea of curiosity help us to build an
<BR>
explanation of mind?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's fairly well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;settled that we have evolved to be curious, as curiosity and the pursuit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its satisfaction have served us well in our quest for survival and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;domination of the planet.  We are then naturally curious about all manner of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questions, including the nature of mind.  Curiosity by its very nature longs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for satisfaction.  That, if for no other reason, is why I want to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, so mind has evolved. Homo sapiens has evolved. We got here by Darwinian
<BR>
(or neo-Darwinian, or post-Darwinian) evolution. From what I've read of Deep
<BR>
Evolution, complexity enters into it as well. And auto-catalytic adaptive
<BR>
systems. But we still need an explanation of mind so that we can build one.
<BR>
Unless we just throw a bunch of digital DNA together and watch what emerges.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;*Nothing* requires explanation.  That does not mean we should not attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explanation.  You are right that truth is of primary importance.  So what of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the truth about mind?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing requires no explanation, because no explanation explains it perfectly. I
<BR>
think we may as well try to explain it anyway, because the exercise may lead to
<BR>
a more comprehensive understanding of importance. What is of most importance for
<BR>
Homo sapiens I think we should try to determine. In truth, I suspect that mind
<BR>
does not exist, because what people mean by &quot;mind&quot; exists only in their brains'
<BR>
imagination.
<BR>
<P>Grok it and rocket,
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
