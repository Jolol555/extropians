<EM>&gt; Is art and &quot;work&quot; (whatever discipline one prefers to refer to) exclusively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for others' recognition? Is it created for validation &amp; results? Can't it be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply for one's own enjoyment? Can't I paint a masterpeice, let no one see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, and throw it in the trash - for my own self amusement, and still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating?
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely.  If I my &quot;creative&quot; words made it seem otherwise, it was meme
<BR>
jumbling.  Creation (or the recognition of unusual mental states that have
<BR>
some apparent beauty/rhythym/resonance/usefullness/etc.) is of inherent
<BR>
value to the creator.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You seem to assert that it is not valid until it receives outside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition. This may be the way academia works - work is not valid until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; published or reviewed, and how business of art is done, but it does not cover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the spectrum of creativity across mediums.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  I was only trying to express perhaps that the publication process
<BR>
is for me a much more difficult &quot;job&quot; than the creation process.  It can
<BR>
probably be argued that idea &quot;creation&quot;(recognition) and creative execution
<BR>
(production) may be functions of relatively separate areas of the brain
<BR>
that are more or less well developed in different individuals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First I'd like to ask you, have you visited her online art gallery? Did you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ask her whether her art requires intense discipline? Have you seen the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;variations on a theme&quot; that is the DNA breakout series? You are talking to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diehard fan of her art, BTW.
</EM><BR>
<P>Answers would be: Yes, though not recently; I assume that it does (but I'll
<BR>
have to look at her subsequent email to see whether the intensity and/or
<BR>
discipline are more involved with the idea recognition phases or the
<BR>
production phases); and Yes, though I have not seen her latest book.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You first make assertions that creativity requires communication and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition, and perhaps even having an impact of some sort on an outside 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;audience.&quot; Then you (inconsistently ; - ) imply that the nature of art is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural outpouring, or growth. Is this really true? What are your sources for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this assertion?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the creation of the ideas, and their *self*-recognition tends to be a
<BR>
very natural process (its something I personally would have a hard time stopping!).
<BR>
[So this is a personal experience citation.]  However, the &quot;expression&quot; of
<BR>
creativity (i.e. making it real) does require some form of communication.
<BR>
The *other*-&quot;recognition&quot; is primarily external feedback on whether your
<BR>
&quot;creation&quot; is creating similar idea resonance(s) in other individuals.
<BR>
[Clearly my word &quot;creations&quot; that started this thread did not have exactly the
<BR>
resonances I intended... :-)]
<BR>
<P>We can probably cite dozens of examples of artists whose ideas only resonated
<BR>
at a time much after their life (i.e. ideas ahead of their time) as well as
<BR>
artists who seem to have hit upon &quot;classic&quot; resonances that get recreated by
<BR>
many different individuals from many different cultures in many generations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You assert that a work is not creative unless it is &quot;new&quot; - even that it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't creative to conceive and execute similar variations on a theme. Is this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realistic? As an artist I cannot say that I have ever done anything truly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original, yet each of my own pieces is unlike anything before. I believe we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build on foundations, and improve and rearrange things in new ways. Music 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is utterly new would be cacophonous. The truly new would be unfamiliar 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and unrecognizable and hence cognitively boring.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that &quot;new&quot; is a very relative term.  All most all art draws
<BR>
on the foundation before it.  Young artists usually have to spend a fair
<BR>
amount of time &quot;exploring&quot; existing forms of expression or execution methods.
<BR>
After this there are many directions to go in -- refine a current form,
<BR>
apply old techniques to a new form, invent a new form and execution methods,
<BR>
etc.  Therein lies perhaps the crux of the degree of creativity (and
<BR>
intelligence behind the creativity).  To remain &quot;connected&quot; with others
<BR>
you cannot vary the theme too much.  Humans may be hard-wired for finding
<BR>
certain musical rhythms appealing, exceed these boundaries and you no longer
<BR>
have music.  So the question is how much you stretch the connection?  The
<BR>
farther you stretch, the more limited is the audience that will likely be
<BR>
successful in mentally reproducing what you intended.  I suspect really
<BR>
clever artists find ways of grounding their work that is very subtle
<BR>
so that different individuals can get 3 of the 5 connections required
<BR>
to get some major part of the original idea's resonance.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; This is a totally unrelated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thread, but a very key aspect of futurism: Are we to create a totally new 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paradigm, or are we wiser to build on certain patterns we have already 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; established. The unfamiliarity of all things is inherent in the concept of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Singularity (and I admit I am not a Singulatarian by any means!!) If things 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are to be pleasing to our aesthetics, and rational in nature, should we not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep what works and build upon it, rather than throwing away all concepts in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; search of originality?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we have to do both (carefully one hopes).  Existing approaches
<BR>
do reach &quot;dead ends&quot;.   I suspect in art this gets treated as &quot;breaking
<BR>
the mold&quot; or some other similar cliche.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4) COGNITIVE PROCESS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ....how the creative mind works, in respect to being able to create and hold 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a variety of concepts, mixing them in new ways, without being bound by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tradition - and the relating label of &quot;inconsistency.&quot; I see your point here, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I agree, variance and flexibility can combine/juxtapose more freely. Aaha!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Well one out of four isn't bad...  Got to get to 3 out of 5 however... :-)
