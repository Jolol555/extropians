<P><EM>&gt; Well, in &quot;current&quot; reality it seems difficult, but in future reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an &quot;eJury&quot; would do the trick.  Just copy &quot;uploaded&quot; minds selected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Jury duty.  Have the trial.  When situations arise where things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to be &quot;ignored&quot;, you just do a &quot;rollback&quot; (database terminology) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time prior to the occurence of those things that need to be ignored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As was observed by Baily in &quot;After Thought&quot; the problem is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal humans don't have a delete key.  We can fix that.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It is not hard in current reality, either.  I've suggested in the past the
<BR>
notion of &quot;semi-professional&quot; juries, at least for the tough cases. 
<BR>
People selected (drafted) at random from the general population to serve
<BR>
six or twelve months (like a grand jury does) and given a two or three
<BR>
week course on basic trial law, the nature of evidence, the psychology of
<BR>
memory, etc., and paid better than the average Joe.  Some portion of them
<BR>
can be &quot;pre-sequestered&quot; for cases where public opinion may sway them
<BR>
(i.e., a pool available that has been isolated since before the crime). 
<BR>
This would, of course, require a speedy trial to keep the time each pool
<BR>
is sequestered resonable, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, no?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've always thought one of the interesting *nits* in the legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system is the concept of Judgement by one's &quot;peers&quot;.  Does that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that I get a jury of Extropians?  Or do I get a jury where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the people watch Days of our Lives, Jerry Springer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and WWF all day?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always thought, given the nature of society at the time the phrase
<BR>
came about, that it referred to a jury of one's social class.  Nobles
<BR>
judged by nobles, peasants by peasants, etc.  It has little or no meaning
<BR>
in today's less stratified society.
