</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you have a plan to move Phobos' orbit?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ja, that thing's gotta go.  Out.  {8^D  Amara I realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am making light of a verrry difficult task,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really Spike.  You should preface all of your discussions with
<BR>
the assumptions wMNT or woMNT.  Technically speaking, to be completely
<BR>
accurate, you need &quot;with&quot; Self-Replicating Assemblers (wSRA) with a
<BR>
relatively general &quot;hard&quot; (C/Si/Fe/Al) construction capability.
<BR>
Those are likely doable with MEMS.
<BR>
<P>In my calculations for planetary dismantlement, I've used
<BR>
highly conservative figures for solar collector areal mass
<BR>
(1 kg/m^2).  The disassembly times for the Moon, Phobos,
<BR>
Deimos and Mars respectively are 67, 113, 109 and 175 days(!).
<BR>
The moon wins because of its large area and greater insolation.
<BR>
Phobos and Deimos have slow ramp times due to their small
<BR>
surface area for collectors, Mars is handicapped by the
<BR>
gravity well.
<BR>
<P>If you are more aggressive with your areal density, you
<BR>
can push these times much faster.  That has to be offset
<BR>
by probable element limitations for the machines you need
<BR>
to build.  Until you get an engineering team together
<BR>
to work out the element requirements for things like
<BR>
the solar collectors and mass drivers, its difficult
<BR>
to refine this any further.  In addition I suspect
<BR>
the composition of Phobos &amp; Deimos is relatively
<BR>
unclear (densities around 3.3 g/cm^3).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but recall that the discussion started with theoretical strength
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calcs for an earth synchronous cable, and my contention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that with materials we have now, we are not there yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With Mars, we might have materials that are just strong enough.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike, I think you should send a note to Landis if you have
<BR>
questions about this.  I've got his email address if you need it.
<BR>
He has responded to my posts in the past.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Therefore, your tower in Mars synchronous orbits looks to me that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is in a bit of danger from Phobos and its hypothetical ring.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ja.  Well, maybe this whole notion really isnt a go.  {8-[
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Damn.  Unless we can figure out a way to clean up all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that space dust.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>You have to send out the MEMS cleaning bots to sweep it
<BR>
off the solar collectors and bring it back as an additional
<BR>
mass resource.  :-]  Or if its got any charge on it you
<BR>
could use electrical field ram-scoop to funnel it into
<BR>
your manufacutring plants.
<BR>
<P>R.
