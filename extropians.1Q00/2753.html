It appears as if Robert J. Bradbury &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com?Subject=Re:%20High%20Temperature%20Procreation%20Calisthenics&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002141552.QAA12639@color.sics.se&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com</A>&gt; wrote:

|As Ken pointed out, we now have cases where our email
<BR>
|agents are &quot;hiding&quot; things from our attention because
<BR>
|they look like things we think are irrelevant (gosh
<BR>
|isn't that what the brain does much of the time???)
<BR>
<P>Those who use suboptimal information trimmers will lose data, naturally.
<BR>
<P>If one decides to use brain prostheses to sort out irrelevant inputs,
<BR>
then one will want to assume the position of ultimate decision maker
<BR>
of this cyborganic system, not slave of some suboptimal software.
<BR>
<P>Avoid simple ``spam filters'' or you may lose data.  You have been warned.
<BR>
<P>|Then as Sasha pointed out, we should have some strength
<BR>
|vis-a-vis our convictions.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|But as Eliezer/Neal/Ziana observe, it isn't our convictions
<BR>
|that are so much the problem but the convictions of the
<BR>
|non-extropian overlords of list subscribers who may not be
<BR>
|especially happy with the topics we so freely throw around.
<BR>
<P>If one adopts the transhumanist/extropian world view,
<BR>
then one would want to either
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) assume the rôle of a free humanoid,
<BR>
or	(b) become an information guerilla unit.  
<BR>
<P>Personally, I prefer the (a) solutionm, as it requires less energy.
<BR>
<P>In a territory controlled by some fascistoid or pure fascist government or
<BR>
group, one would need to use the (b) solution, to survive.
<BR>
<P>Somewhat disappointing to note that the U.S. marches on, in the name of
<BR>
political correctness, towards a fascistic future where true freedom
<BR>
of information exchange has been suppressed. !-[
<BR>
<P>|One sees in the [distant?] horizon a lawsuit from parents
<BR>
|against members of the Extropian list for contributing to
<BR>
|the suicide of a list subscriber who became excessively
<BR>
|depressed upon encountering discussions of Damien's &quot;Spike&quot; and
<BR>
|Hanson's &quot;There Shall Be Only One&quot; uploading economics and
<BR>
|Bradbury's proposed deactivation of obsolete sub-SIs (e.g. humans).
<BR>
<P>Yes.  Unchecked, stupidity becomes the dictator.
<BR>
Either you control stupidity or it controls you.
<BR>
<P>[Or: ``Thoughs Good! Slogans Bad!'' !-]
<BR>
<P>|As recent discussions regading DeCSS (see Slashdot.org and
<BR>
|pointers from it to Linux World) indicate, though their
<BR>
|may be no merit to these legal actions, the net effect
<BR>
|would be stifle free speech (and force conformance)
<BR>
|among the list subscribers.  We only have to consider
<BR>
|the can-of-worms that Keith Henson is in for evidence
<BR>
|of this situation.
<BR>
<P>According to my data, U.S. law prohibits one to receive and decrypt data
<BR>
that others sends into your site/house/person/etc (e.g. satellite TV)
<BR>
unless specifically allowed by the sender of the data in question.
<BR>
<P>With a law prohibiting that, the DeCSS software illegalization seems
<BR>
mainly a continuation of the same trend.
<BR>
<P>IMO, the struggle was lost when the govt allowed the megacorps to send
<BR>
encrypted data into your site and prohibited you from decrypting the data
<BR>
except under the circumstances expressly allowed for by those megacorps.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, who expects U.S. law to exhibit consistency? !-]
<BR>
<P>|Should we start an Extropian Legal Defense Fund now?
<BR>
<P>As long as the Extropian organization continues to have its economical base
<BR>
camp located in the Land of the Lawyers: ``Yes, definitely.''.
<BR>
<P>|Related to this, most humans are easily fooled by
<BR>
|relatively primitive encryption...  Should we develop
<BR>
|simple programs that would allow the list-server to
<BR>
|transmit &quot;temperature adjective of physical act between
<BR>
|two individuals&quot; for subsequent translation on the
<BR>
|reader's machine only when the magic key sequence
<BR>
|is entered?
<BR>
<P>You might also use the old KGB method of dividing the organization into an
<BR>
inner and outer layer.  The outer layer would then simply attract all those
<BR>
technology-happy humanoids out there with harmless future-positive gospels,
<BR>
while the inner layer would find relevant outer layer members and initiate
<BR>
them into the Real Agenda.
<BR>
<P>Then again, the nominally free might feel uncomfortable with this.
