&quot;Germany Sees Biotech Field With New Eyes&quot;

Science: A convergence of events frees researchers and creates an exciting
<BR>
new industry devoted to medical advances. By Carol J. Williams, LA Times
<BR>
Staff Writer, 3/14/00
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MARTINSRIED, Germany--When noted biochemistry professor Ernst-Ludwig
<BR>
Winnacker began lobbying the government for a gene research center in the
<BR>
mid-1980s, the very notion of trying to crack the human genetic code was so
<BR>
taboo that he became a target of radical environmentalists and the terrorist
<BR>
Red Army Faction.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unwelcome was any thought of &quot;interfering with God&quot; in rewriting the
<BR>
human body's computer program, Winnacker recalls, that the government had to
<BR>
post armed guards outside his home and sheathe his office in bulletproof
<BR>
glass.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the best and brightest of German scientists fled to the more
<BR>
supportive environment of U.S. labs and contributed to breakthroughs in
<BR>
treating debilitating and fatal diseases, Germans came to the conclusion
<BR>
that gene technology offered great promise in improving the quality and
<BR>
longevity of life.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly, as one recently repatriated entrepreneur puts it,
<BR>
&quot;biotech start-ups began sprouting up around here like mushrooms after a
<BR>
warm rain.&quot; More than 600 German firms are now engaged in genetic research,
<BR>
the vast majority founded within the last five years.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This glass-and-steel industrial park on the outskirts of Munich has
<BR>
become an incubator for biotech business in that short time span. Many of
<BR>
the small private firms rising from the ubiquitous construction sites are
<BR>
flush with newfound venture capital and income from initial public offerings
<BR>
of stock.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been made possible by a synergy of reversed public sympathies,
<BR>
watershed genetic discoveries and a changing attitude in this country toward
<BR>
entrepreneurial success and personal wealth.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence of events has given Germany and its scientific elite a
<BR>
chance to do their part in treating what ails the world, from AIDS to
<BR>
cancer.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, say industry leaders, the biotech boom has created the opportunity
<BR>
for Germany's once-vaunted pharmaceutical giants such as Bayer, Hoechst and
<BR>
Schering to recover their global positions after 15 years of
<BR>
&quot;biotechnophobia&quot; that allowed U.S. competitors to surge to the fore. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the biotechnology discoveries of the 1970s and '80s benefited
<BR>
the U.S. labs that underwrote them, many German scientists were instrumental
<BR>
in the developments. Some have returned to their homeland now that the
<BR>
atmosphere is more supportive. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axel Ullrich, who cloned the first gene for human insulin during his
<BR>
postdoctoral work at UC San Francisco and helped develop a drug for
<BR>
treatment of breast cancer while at Sugen Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., now
<BR>
divides his time between business interests in the United States and this
<BR>
biotech village. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like others watching the rapid expansion of gene and genome technology
<BR>
here, he senses a sea change in attitudes among German scientists and within
<BR>
the ossified halls of academia that have long suppressed entrepreneurial
<BR>
spirits. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These uncomplicated, aggressive, let's-just-do-it kind of guys you
<BR>
find in the United States--we just didn't have that here,&quot; Ullrich said.
<BR>
&quot;But I've been pleasantly surprised to see young people now adopting those
<BR>
styles and attitudes. There's such enthusiasm now, which is another German
<BR>
syndrome. We have a tendency to sleep for a long time, then dive into
<BR>
something with tremendous zeal and pursuit of perfection.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the attitudinal changes he sees from a decade ago is the
<BR>
increasing acceptance, even admiration, of those who become rich from their
<BR>
inventions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When I came back 10 years ago, it was assumed by everyone that I had
<BR>
made a pile of money, and I felt very excluded,&quot; Ullrich says of the
<BR>
professional cold shoulder then given those who made their mark in U.S.
<BR>
laboratories, where top scientists are better compensated than at German
<BR>
facilities. &quot;This reaction of envy is still a problem, but it's much better
<BR>
now.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and other leading genetic researchers spent the early years of their
<BR>
careers across the Atlantic because there was virtually no opportunity to do
<BR>
the work in Germany in the face of such strident public protest, he says.
<BR>
Even the big pharmaceutical companies that wanted to invest in gene research
<BR>
sent their money overseas to avoid becoming political targets. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoechst, once the world's No. 1 drug manufacturer, poured $200 million
<BR>
into a gene lab at Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1980s. Other big
<BR>
players in Germany had decided that they didn't need to back biotechnology
<BR>
at all because they could buy it from the U.S. leaders, said Ullrich. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much of that has changed. &quot;There is far more insight now into the
<BR>
benefits of biotechnology, especially in the life science fields. There are
<BR>
new vaccines and new drugs now capable of treating the causes of disease,
<BR>
not just symptoms,&quot; said Bernhard Hertel, managing director of Garching
<BR>
Innovation, a Max Planck Society offspring that helps create viable private
<BR>
companies from the state-financed research network. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade, Garching has played midwife to 31 start-ups that
<BR>
have created more than 1,000 jobs and has 13 projects in the works this
<BR>
year, said Hertel. The first private company spun off was Sugen, recently
<BR>
bought by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc., the U.S. pharmaceutical giant. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnacker, who no longer needs police protection, is now on leave from
<BR>
his professorship at the University of Munich to oversee the German Research
<BR>
Society, a Bonn-based federal agency that functions like a hybrid of the
<BR>
National Institutes for Health and the National Science Foundation in the
<BR>
United States. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gene research was an important stage, but genomics is a revolution,&quot; the
<BR>
mild-mannered academic says about the relatively new science exploring the
<BR>
interaction of the genetic code. &quot;This makes it possible to analyze the
<BR>
complex biological aspects of diseases like cancer so we know why it
<BR>
develops the way it does and how we might influence it. The outlook is
<BR>
incredible.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the projects in the works here is an examination of how nerve cells
<BR>
are genetically programmed to prevent their reproducing themselves after
<BR>
being severed--information that could one day make it possible to reverse
<BR>
paraplegia, Winnacker said. Others involve development of drugs to treat
<BR>
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other degenerative diseases. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We lost a considerable amount of time, but genomics discoveries came
<BR>
so much later that they have leveled the playing field somewhat,&quot; Winnacker
<BR>
said. &quot;Now, the situation is very good for German scientists to remain here.
<BR>
The question is how to get more American scientists to come here, to mix it
<BR>
up a bit.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany's turnabout on gene research was spurred by an ambitious
<BR>
government project in the mid-1990s that made matching funds available for
<BR>
biotech start-ups in three designated regions in and around the cities of
<BR>
Cologne, Heidelberg and Munich. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Germany was one of the major high-technology countries in the world
<BR>
after the United States and Japan, and some people suddenly realized
<BR>
biotechnology is the way of the future,&quot; said Bernd Seizinger, who left his
<BR>
home and business in Princeton, N.J., last year to head Genome
<BR>
Pharmaceuticals Co. here. &quot;There needs to be enormous effort made not only
<BR>
to get into this field but to catch up to the United States.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described the availability of venture capital here as better than
<BR>
across the Atlantic at the moment and thoroughly revolutionized from a
<BR>
decade ago, when hardly a German citizen risked investing his savings in
<BR>
anything but a low-return passbook account. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other movers in the science community, Seizinger sees the fever of
<BR>
mergers and acquisitions among the pharmaceutical titans as an opportunity
<BR>
for biotech firms to take on responsibility for important medicinal
<BR>
breakthroughs. Firms like his make the discoveries, then the big drug
<BR>
companies use their production, marketing and distribution power to bring
<BR>
the products to the consumer. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Most pharmaceutical companies are driven by the products they sell,
<BR>
not [research and development],&quot; he said. &quot;A biotech company's value is in
<BR>
the creativity of its people.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exuding the enthusiasm of an inventor, he described how genome research
<BR>
is mapping the &quot;computer program that tells the body how to live&quot; and will
<BR>
one day allow medicine to intervene when the program is defective. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're just at the beginning of this,&quot; he insists. &quot;It's . . . a true
<BR>
paradigm shift in the history of medicine. He describes the pace of genome
<BR>
discoveries as so accelerated that Germany may catch up to U.S. counterparts
<BR>
despite its 15-to-20-year lag in getting started. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German firms still play a minor role in comparison with U.S. companies,
<BR>
which account for more than 330 of the 400 publicly traded biotechnology
<BR>
companies listed on the world's stock markets, German media report. But two
<BR>
of the most recent IPOs, Hamburg's Evotech and local start-up MorphoSys,
<BR>
have seen their stock values more than quintuple since launching in October.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition remains fierce in Europe to what scientists call &quot;green
<BR>
genetics,&quot; or modification of the basic substances of crops and animals. But
<BR>
scientists say this resistance will dissipate as well once the global public
<BR>
is educated about the value it offers in feeding the world's growing ranks
<BR>
of hungry citizens. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This technology will change our lives, especially if we overcome our
<BR>
food phobia,&quot; says Ullrich, trumpeting genetic engineering's promise for
<BR>
feeding the Third World and shielding food from disease, toxins and the
<BR>
whims of weather. &quot;As long as Earth wants to sustain an ever-increasing
<BR>
population, it must expand these branches of science. People want to live
<BR>
longer, healthier lives.&quot;
