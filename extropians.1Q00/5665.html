<EM>&gt; &gt; As I've said before, privacy is a thing of the present, not of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm sure it will take quite some time for everyone to get on board, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only way to real freedom is mutually assured surveillance.  Anonymity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worthless to most law abiding citizens.  As fewer legal things become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;taboo&quot; anonymity will be completely worthless, except to criminals.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not Orwellian at all.  It's me watching you watching me watching Big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; watching us all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Big Borther, and all of your neighbors, are watching you....Now you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really feel free now, right? &quot;Slavery is freedom.&quot; Yup thats 'real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freedom' alright.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well no.  No one is watching me now, at least not very closely (at least not 
<BR>
that I'm aware of).  And of course, to the extent that I am being watched 
<BR>
right now, it does not give me any sense of freedom.  But the reason for 
<BR>
that is that the &quot;watching&quot; is not *mutual*.  Mutuality is the key to 
<BR>
freedom in a transparent society.
<BR>
<P>If you can watch me and I can (1) know the extent to which you are watching 
<BR>
me and (2) watch you to the exact same extent.  Yes, my friend, that is 
<BR>
freedom.  Especially for law-abiding folks like myself.  See, when you live 
<BR>
your life with integrity, you have nothing to fear from people watching how 
<BR>
you live your life.  Especially when you know exactly *who* is watching 
<BR>
exactly *which* parts of your life and you can turn the microscope around 
<BR>
and watch them right back.  An additional benefit of transparency is that it 
<BR>
encourages people with less integrity (no I'm not pointing any fingers) to 
<BR>
act in more trustworthy ways.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Prisoners obey the law because they are in prison, not because it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtuous to do so. Treating everyone like a prisoner means the death of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freedom, not 'real freedom'. Once nobody cares what is virtuous behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in themselves or others, what makes you think that they will care who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;watching them as they do anything they want to? At that point, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing keeping the average person in a law abiding state is the threat of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instant police action.
</EM><BR>
<P>Prisoners obey the law for the same reason that everyone else does: they 
<BR>
don't want to face the consequences of disobeying the law.  For people with 
<BR>
integrity those consequences consist primarily of one's own nagging 
<BR>
conscience.  For others the primary consequences include humiliation and 
<BR>
loss of money, liberty or life.  This will not change in a transparent 
<BR>
society.  The only change will be the swift and sure imposition of the 
<BR>
consequences (which after all is a *good* thing, particularly for those of 
<BR>
us who are law-abiding by nature).
<BR>
<P>But you miss the point, transparency is not about treating people as 
<BR>
prisoners.  It's about treating people as family (which when you think about 
<BR>
it is what they are).  I know almost everything about my wife.  Her 
<BR>
finances, her hopes, her fears, her weaknesses, her strengths.  I know 
<BR>
exactly how she'll react if I kiss the backs of her knees.  I know where she 
<BR>
is almost all the time.  Does that make her my prisoner?  Especially when 
<BR>
(1) she knows that I know these things about her and (2) she knows all these 
<BR>
same things about me?
<BR>
<P>You may not like it.  But no matter.  Transparency is the *only* solution 
<BR>
for a society of superhumans.  When any given person has the potential to 
<BR>
set in motion things that could lead to the sterilization of the entire 
<BR>
planet, you had better be able to trust (and keep a damn close eye on) your 
<BR>
neighbors.  After all, if you could trust me, I mean *really* trust me, 
<BR>
would you really mind so much if I knew everything about you?  That 
<BR>
knowledge would make me a much better companion for you and would make me 
<BR>
more fun for you to be around.
<BR>
<P>Who knows...if I knew everything about you, and you knew everything about 
<BR>
me, and we could both trust the other implicitly, we'd probably become the 
<BR>
best of friends.  As it stands I think you are a reactionary gun &quot;nut&quot; and 
<BR>
you probably think I am a sanctimonious and narrow-minded fascist.  Surely 
<BR>
we can do better than that.
