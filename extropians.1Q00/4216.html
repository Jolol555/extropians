<EM>&gt;I think we need to head this off at the pass, so to speak. We should invite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;xians into the fold a little maybe. I'll use cryonics for an example. I see 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason why this must be against any fundamental xian belief. As one friend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it to me &quot;I want to see the future while still in the flesh&quot;. I have said 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;xian friends and family that if it works the person obviously by their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definitions was not yet truly dead. I'm filtering this through a xian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paradigm I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am familiar with. That of my former own beliefs and of my families current. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't believe the soul goes to heaven immediately upon death but rather is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;asleep until resurrection. So, here, there is room to say that should the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics patient awaken this has merely been a suspension and no more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usurping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;god then a resuscitation from a heart attack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, take those that do think the soul goes to heaven. A case could be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that if the cryonics patient is revived, then their soul somehow found the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again. In ether case I don't see how it is necessary to take the position 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;god has been usurped. I would argue, even though I am atheist, that if god
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exists we mere humans couldn't possibly usurp him/her/it. That if cryonics 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the individual xian then god has allowed it in order to allow the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have more time on this world to do their so called good works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What say you all? Could we pander to potential foes to prevent them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Not likely.  Being a former fundie myself the old scriptures/sayings 
<BR>
immediately come back: &quot;It is appointed unto man *once* to die, and after 
<BR>
death, the judgment&quot; and &quot;Absent from the body is present with the Lord.&quot;  
<BR>
Then of course there are the powerful analogies of the tree of life and the 
<BR>
tower of Babel.
<BR>
<P>At least until the first actual, successful, human revival occurs, I would 
<BR>
not bet on any Christian support of cryonic suspension.  Of course once the 
<BR>
first revival happens and the revivee turns out not to seem like a soul-less 
<BR>
zombie, but a very close proximation of their former self, the Christian 
<BR>
philosophers will really have something to think about.
