Protocols
<BR>
DHEA REPLACEMENT
<BR>
In 1981, the Life Extension Foundation introduced DHEA
<BR>
(dehydroepiandrosterone) through an article that described the multiple
<BR>
antiaging effects this hormone might produce. The general public learned
<BR>
about DHEA in 1996, as the benefits of DHEA were touted by the news media
<BR>
and in several popular books.
<BR>
<P>DHEA obtained credibility in the medical establishment when the New York
<BR>
Academy of Sciences published a book entitled DHEA and Aging and
<BR>
summarized in their journal, Aging (Dec. 29, 1995, 774:1-350). This highly
<BR>
technical book provided scientific validation for the many life extension
<BR>
effects of DHEA replacement therapy.
<BR>
<P>DHEA has been shown to protect against heart disease and atherosclerosis.
<BR>
A study using coronary artery angiography showed that low DHEA levels
<BR>
predispose people to more significant coronary artery blockage. Another
<BR>
study showed that DHEA inhibits abnormal blood platelet aggregation, a
<BR>
factor in the development of sudden heart attack and stroke. In contrast,
<BR>
some studies on DHEA do not show the cardiovascular disease protection

&quot;VITAMIN K&quot; by Terri Mitchell
<BR>
Sudden death from heart attack is associated with calcification of the
<BR>
aorta, especially in young men. In the Framingham Heart Study, 35 year-old
<BR>
men with calcifications in the aorta had a 7 times increased risk of dying
<BR>
of a sudden heart attack. The risk decreases with age, but the chance of
<BR>
suddenly dying of a heart attack is doubled in people under 65 if their
<BR>
aortas are calcified.  
<BR>
<P>Imagine a vitamin that could keep calcium in bones and out of arteries. In
<BR>
so doing, that vitamin could stop heart attack and osteoporosis at the
<BR>
same time. Sound incredible? Maybe, but research shows that vitamin K does
<BR>
exactly that. It works by regulating calcium. Bones need it, arteries
<BR>
can't stand it. Vitamin K accommodates both.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID INHIBITS FREE RADICALS...BETTER THAN VITAMIN E
<BR>
It is well known that alpha-lipoic acid is used by the body to aid in
<BR>
mitochondrial energy metabolism, but this new study, published in the
<BR>
November 1999 issue of Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine showed that it
<BR>
specifically inhibits the oxidation of protein, LDL cholesterol and
<BR>
cellular DNA.
<BR>
<P>Protein oxidation has been implicated in aging and heart disease. Since
<BR>
alpha-lipoic acid is both fat- and water- soluble, it could prove to be
<BR>
more potent than other antioxidants. Besides preventing neuropathy,
<BR>
alpha-lipoic acid is especially important for diabetics because it may
<BR>
improve blood-glucose control by improving insulin action while also
<BR>
inhibiting the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which contributes to heart
<BR>
disease, said the researchers. Diabetics are at increased risk of heart
<BR>
disease and have increased oxidative stress.

<BR>
<P>NATURAL THERAPIES OFFER HOPE FOR PARKINSON'S
<BR>
Several prescription medications have shown promise in managing the
<BR>
symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The drugs, though, frequently come
<BR>
with a host of side effects, and studies suggest better alternatives may
<BR>
be close at hand. It could be the answers lie in natural therapies, which
<BR>
may slow the disease's progression and possibly even decrease motor
<BR>
deficits associated with Parkinson's disease.
<BR>
<P>In an effort to assess a natural therapy in treating the illness, The
<BR>
National Institutes of Health (NIH) is funding a trial to study coenzyme
<BR>
Q10's ability to slow the progression of PD.  Substantial evidence has
<BR>
indicated that mitochondria (energy-producing cell parts) are impaired in
<BR>
PD. Work in a Parkinson's disease-affected animal model indicated that
<BR>
dietary supplementation with coenzyme Q10, which is a natural part of all
<BR>
cells, might slow the progression of the disease.  Those who are in its
<BR>
early stages, and thereby do not require levodopa (Sinemet) or other
<BR>
medication, are eligible to participate in the study.

Product of the Week!
<BR>
ANTI-ALCOHOL ANTIOXIDANTS
<BR>
A remarkable study was reported in which a group of rats were given a dose
<BR>
of acetaldehyde large enough to kill 90% of them. Rats given a combination
<BR>
of vitamin C, cysteine and vitamin B1 had no deaths. These antioxidants
<BR>
provided 100% protection against acetaldehyde induced death. For many
<BR>
years, medical interns would give themselves injections of thiamine
<BR>
(vitamin B1) to cure a hangover. We now know how vitamin B1 inhibits the
<BR>
free radical pathologies. There is now more evidence than ever that
<BR>
drinking can be made safer by saturating your body with antioxidants while
<BR>
you drink alcoholic beverages. 
<BR>
<P>Although you can avoid a hangover by taking antioxidants before going to
<BR>
bed, a lot of cancer causing damage can occur before then, so it makes
<BR>
sense to bring at least six Anti-Alcohol Antioxidants capsules with you
<BR>
when you know you are going to be drinking. Try to get into the habit of
<BR>
taking one Anti-Alcohol Antioxidant capsule with each drink.
