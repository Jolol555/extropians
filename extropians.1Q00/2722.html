</EM><BR>
<P>Though John or Hal can probably give much nicer answers, I'll take a shot.
<BR>
<P>Mass creates a distortion in space (a black hole being the ultimate
<BR>
distortion).  Its typically represented as a &quot;depression&quot; in space.
<BR>
When you &quot;orbit&quot; something your orbatal velocity &quot;out&quot; of the depression
<BR>
is balanced by the net acceleration into the depression (towards
<BR>
the mass).  Speed up and you move out, slow down and you move in.
<BR>
<P>The effect of gravity isn't the effect of one body on another,
<BR>
its the effect of two spatial distortions interacting.  Gravity
<BR>
waves presumably result from great distortions in space (probably
<BR>
from colliding black holes, neutron stars, etc.).  Smaller masses
<BR>
presumably generate them as well, but they are way to small to measure.
<BR>
An interesting question would be -- how small the masses have to be
<BR>
before they start getting down to the extra dimensions postulated
<BR>
in string theory.
<BR>
<P>So, I'm guessing (since I haven't taken astrophysics), that the
<BR>
reason the event horizon exists is because your orbital velocity
<BR>
would have to be faster than light-speed to overcome the acceleration
<BR>
pulling you into the singularity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doesn't the indisputable fact of gavitational influence by the foremost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidates for black holedom suggest that either they are not black holes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or that the theory of black holes is flawed? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Nope, everything seems consistent.
<BR>
<P>The only problem I've seen pointed out with black holes is that they
<BR>
violate a &quot;conservation of information&quot; principle.  The basic problem
<BR>
is that once matter goes into the black hole, its impossible to get
<BR>
back any information that was contained in that matter.  Now, I'm not
<BR>
sure how &quot;strict&quot; that principle is, unlike say &quot;conservation of momentum&quot;,
<BR>
so it isn't clear (to me) whether that creates big problems or only
<BR>
little ones.
