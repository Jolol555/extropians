<P>How about a Unitarian-Extropian denominational structure?  The Church of Max

More of Present-Day Extropians... :)  &quot;According to my beliefs you must let

only it were that easy.

<P>Perhaps with all this discussion of Greg's &quot;list of groups whose ideas 
<BR>
extropians partially or totally oppose&quot; we should go a step further.  Let's 
<BR>
throw a pie in the face of our opponents starting with Jeremy Rifkin but 
<BR>
make sure the berries in this fruitpie are not genetically tampered with!  
<BR>
Isn't he more deserving then Bill Gates?  Seriously, I have to admit I was 
<BR>
impressed by some of the sound advice I read on the topic of the opponents 
<BR>
list by Natasha and Eliezer, to name a few.

<EM>&gt;It seems highly unwise to assume that all those who disagree with us &gt;are

Error in terms of the technoholocaust Eugene brings up as a possibility?  Or 
<BR>
perhaps a stasist view that present biological humanity should be improved 
<BR>
but not transcended? Perhaps God in fact existing and Christ being divine 
<BR>
and returning in glory to set things right?
<BR>
<P>Eugene Leitl:
<BR>
Well, call me old-fashioned, but if it kills me, it's wrong. How can we 
<BR>
realistically assess the probability that transhumanism is not 
<BR>
technoholocaust in disguise? The machines to end all mankind?
<BR>
I thought about this as I read Eliezer's magnum opus (I just had to say that 
<BR>
again!).  The Terminator 2 scenario is not a pleasant one.
<BR>
<P>I admit all the jokes about the Bible has bothered me somewhat though you 
<BR>
have the right to say it certainly.  I can see Spike and Rick making jokes 
<BR>
(but eventually repenting of it) if the Christian fundamentalists are right 
<BR>
and all the horrible events of the tribulation come forth.  Now that would 
<BR>
not make for a bright, extropian future.
