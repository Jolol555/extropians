<P>My interest in this is the opposite directions that Vermont and California
<BR>
seem to be going in.  This would seem to give us a preview of the potential
<BR>
&quot;enclaves&quot; that may develop in terms of use of nanotech, biotech, medtech,
<BR>
privacy, etc.  The question becomes -- would the people in Vermont view
<BR>
the situation in California as a sufficient violation of human rights
<BR>
as to go to war over it?  Or is it entirely in the legal/governmental
<BR>
realms?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps its a good thing that Vermont &amp; California are on opposite coasts.
<BR>
<P>It is however, completely suprising to me (as a conservative &quot;Yankee&quot;),
<BR>
that *Vermont* is going to the liberal side and those wacky Californians
<BR>
are going to the conservative side of this debate.
<BR>
<P>Can the non-U.S. members of the list weigh in on trends in their countries?
