<P><EM>&gt;So we must ask now:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- How do we begin serious design-ahead now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- How do we encourage development (on an open-source basis)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- How do we guide and organize the design-ahead results?  (Ad-hoc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  organization, Web site, institute?)

<P>Well, of course, Drexler and Merkle and others at Foresight have been doing
<BR>
this, bit by bit, for years. The odd thing is the way their efforts still
<BR>
appear to be despised by those in the `regular' or canonical-science/tech
<BR>
authorised nano community. One scientist who read THE SPIKE declared flatly
<BR>
that Eric was a flake (he'd seen him talking at a Foresight conference),
<BR>
and that my book should have extirpated all reference to Foresight and
<BR>
dealt solely with, you know, scanning microscopes and buckytube tips and
<BR>
like that. *Real* science. Even though Drexler and pals were there years in
<BR>
advance of these recent discoveries; even though their projections and
<BR>
design-aheads seem (to me, in my comparative ignorance) fully consistent
<BR>
with what's coming out of the labs. Maybe it's priority envy. Maybe it's
<BR>
green monkeys again.
