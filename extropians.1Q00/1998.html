<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In response to Stirling's post, I wrote all about how much power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solar collectors could produce...
</EM><BR>
<P>In reviewing those numbers, I found 3 errors in my calculations
<BR>
(need more caffeine I guess), but since the errors compensated for
<BR>
each other somewhat the conclusions come out almost the same.
<BR>
<P>If you could surround the equator with a 10 mi band of solar cells
<BR>
you would roughly equal current annual power consumption.  If allow
<BR>
for the lack of &quot;land&quot; at the equator, you have to widen the solar cells
<BR>
on the available land accordingly.  Population growth can be
<BR>
handled by increased efficiency in the cells (technological
<BR>
progress).  One of the real points that I think Stirling is trying to
<BR>
make is the problem of increased per capita energy consumption in
<BR>
developing countries.  For that, I would agree we will need to increase
<BR>
the efficiency of our energy utilization.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   (b) ... re: per capita power consumption &amp; growth rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted. Still, I have a feeling that that will be compensated for by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sheer number of third-world countries that enter the computer age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the next few decades.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that transportation is the big cost.  The question is
<BR>
whether entering the computer+communications age will require the
<BR>
transporation costs we currently have in developed countries or whether
<BR>
&quot;virtual&quot; tele-working and bulk package delivery (of e-ordered goods)
<BR>
will significantly decrease those costs?
<BR>
<P>Most of the population growth &amp; development is occuring in relatively
<BR>
moderate climates, so the heating requirements are less significant
<BR>
than say the U.S. or Europe.  As the recent Transmeta announcements
<BR>
show, you don't *need* a 200W computer (2x human power requirements)
<BR>
to get something that does the job.  A couple of watts will do just
<BR>
fine for most things.  You can counter argue that computer will need
<BR>
more power to do more sophisticated stuff (e.g. speech recognition)
<BR>
and I'll counter that all you are really doing is increasing the
<BR>
effective &quot;population&quot; slightly.  The question becomes whether the
<BR>
added intelligence is effectively used to increase the overall
<BR>
efficiciency (technology growth per W of power input from food
<BR>
or electricity)).  If we end up sucking up all of the power
<BR>
into ever fancier VR games, then we might as well burn the planet
<BR>
now and get it over with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   (c) ... re: improvements in technological efficiency...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yup. Oh, I think the *technology* will improve, but I'm not forcasting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrival of *commercially viable* new  technology. There just doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be enough demand (sad to say) to cause the improvements in cost per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unit that will be sufficient to convince people to switch to alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; methods. I'd love to be proved wrong on this point, BTW.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you are saying is the problem is that there are no mechanisms
<BR>
to bring future costs into the present to *shift* technology inertia
<BR>
into more effective paths so we don't end up paying a huge bill later.
<BR>
The problem is getting *full* cost allocation.  The California
<BR>
regulations effectively do that.  Some might argue that it would
<BR>
simply be better to implement Carbon taxes and make the consumer
<BR>
pay.  Being realistic however I think the regulators have an easier
<BR>
path driving the manufacturers into producing better vehicles and
<BR>
encouraging the goverment to help fund the R&amp;D.  It may not be the
<BR>
most efficient from an economic perspective, but you step on fewer
<BR>
toes and that probably is what makes it work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;   (d) ... re: solar cell efficiencies
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmmm.  I think that was most likely part of the assumption. Then again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's the current per-capita cost of 10^9 km^2 of the expensive kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of solar cell...
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever it is now is going to be pretty irrelevant if you are going to
<BR>
cover 10^9 km^2 with solar cells.  That drives your infrastructure costs
<BR>
down so low that the expensive kind aren't horribly more expensive than
<BR>
the cheap kind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   (e) That we don't use other more efficient technologies such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;       as heliostats and heat pumps to harvest the solar power...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These devices tend to be more expensive and require more maintenance, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, currently they are cheaper.  Some of them have moving mirrors or fluids
<BR>
but presumably you could engineer these for long lifetimes and planned
<BR>
maintenance.  I suspect you can push efficiencies up to ~40% using these
<BR>
approaches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are they really cheaper when the energy cost of their manufacture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and maintenace are factored in?  My guess is yes, but not by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; margin you believe.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, thin shiney aluminium and steel supports aren't particularly
<BR>
expensive now.  But as I said before, Si is more abundant.  If you built
<BR>
the factories to produce this amount of solar cell or heliostat power
<BR>
harvesting devices the costs would probably end up in the same ballpark.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted. My point was just that there just isn't as much solar energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaching the planet as some people seem to think.  Putting a solar cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on top of every car won't suffice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted, but if your car could get 500-600 W/m^2 in the U.S. and
<BR>
convert it directly to human &quot;consumable&quot; energy at ~20-30%, your
<BR>
car *would* harvest enough power to &quot;operate&quot; a human...  Now operating
<BR>
the car is a little different story...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Neither will paving all our roads and rooftops with solar cells.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the continental U.S. (sorry John...) is ~7.7x10^6 km^2 with
<BR>
roughly a billion acres cultivated (~4x10^6 km^2 or 5.2%).  Now
<BR>
the &quot;urban wisdom&quot; numbers I've heard say something like 1-2% of
<BR>
the U.S. is &quot;paved over&quot; (which seems high in comparison to the
<BR>
farmland).  So say we take 1% of the continental U.S. and use
<BR>
the previous, fairly conservative conversion numbers.  That gives
<BR>
about 25 EJ of power annually.  Which is of course less than
<BR>
the ~80 EJ we currently consume.  But technological progress on
<BR>
the efficiency side of production and consumption should push
<BR>
those numbers closer to each other.  Doubling the automobile
<BR>
gas milage alone probably knocks the 80EJ down to 65-70 EJ.
<BR>
We all know there is room for improvement the problem is to
<BR>
get the incentives in place to make the investments to go there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the things *I've* been hoping that nanotech would give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us is a food production system efficient enough to let 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the grain belt be returned to its natural state.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think relatively &quot;good&quot; bio(nano)tech will make significant progress
<BR>
in this respect.  You should have enough solar collecting area
<BR>
on the roof of an average home to supply the power to feed yourself.
<BR>
<P>Even using our terrible ~80 EJ U.S. annual consumption, it still
<BR>
works out that each individual only needs 15-20 m^2 of collection
<BR>
area.  For anyone except people dwelling in city apartments, they
<BR>
probably have that much land or more.  The people in cities have to
<BR>
buy land in Arizona or Texas and pay the grid taxes.
