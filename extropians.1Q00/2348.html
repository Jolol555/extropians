<EM>&gt; I worked on the orbit mechanics and found that if the material were in

<EM>&gt; the same orbital plane as the planet, then all you need to do is figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out how to stop the rotation of the planet, or rather, tide lock it with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sun.  The material could be rotating in the opposite direction as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the planet.  The hole would be drilled on the equator from the dawn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side to the dusk side.

<P>An alternate design:
<BR>
<P>Build the system as a rapidly rotating disk, with a moderately high
<BR>
operating temperature.  You have lots and lots of holes in the disk
<BR>
(slanted, obviously), each with an associated ring of coolant material.  The
<BR>
heat exchange tunnels will be very hot (a few thousand degrees), while the
<BR>
coolant will be very cool (use a big orbit so it has time to cool off).
<BR>
<P>Also, you should imbed something ferrous in the particles so that you can
<BR>
manipulate the stream magnetically.  That way a mass driver system
<BR>
integrated with each tunnel can adjust the coolant vectors to correct for
<BR>
the inevitable orbital instabilities (assuming they aren't too big).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem then is that any individual particle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not be in the tunnel very long, so it would not pick up much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heat.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would assume an SI can easily solve any engineering problem that does not
<BR>
violate the laws of physics.  Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that
<BR>
it can find some clever means of quickly dumping heat from the tunnel to the
<BR>
coolant stream.  (Mind you, I'd still like to think of a good solution to
<BR>
the problem - I just think we shouldn't expect it to b a show-stopper if we
<BR>
don't come up with one.)
