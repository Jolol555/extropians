Subject: Re: IP: Internet pharmacies
<BR>
<P><P>I read this article with interest when it appeared in the paper version of
<BR>
the NYT.  Yet, I was puzzled by some of the statements, which seemed to not
<BR>
account for some of what we are seeing happen here in California.
<BR>
Specifically, the California Medical Assn. has sent mailings to its member
<BR>
physicians regarding the problem of patients being able to get
<BR>
prescriptions on-line without a physicians okay.  They cite Drugstore.com
<BR>
as one of the primary offenders...which would seem to be at odds with what
<BR>
was reported in this article.  A friend of mine, who is a physician in CA,
<BR>
has received mailings from the CMA detailing the problem.  He also reports
<BR>
having heard a discussion program on NPR in which one of the folks
<BR>
interviewed was a 16 year old boy who managed to get a prescription for
<BR>
Viagra from Drugstore.com .  When asked about this, a Drugstore.com
<BR>
representative replied that apparently the physician who checks
<BR>
prescription requests &quot;overlooked&quot; the age information by mistake.
<BR>
(Apparently, to get a prescription from Drugstore.com one needs to fill out
<BR>
a form requesting the medication.  The form is then supposed to be a
<BR>
reviewed by a physician and the prescription filled.)  The CMA feels that
<BR>
visits to real life physicians have been made unnecessary.
<BR>
<P>So, to me, it would appear that this could turn into a political battle of
<BR>
large special interest groups.
<BR>
<P>My own feeling is that, while I wish there were a better way to get most
<BR>
prescriptions filled, I seriously worry about what is happening with drug
<BR>
resistant bacteria.  Misuse of antibiotics seems to be giving rise to an
<BR>
increasing number of these resistant bacteria...and obtaining antibiotics
<BR>
without a prescription and misusing them, will only make the problem worse
<BR>
(it's bad enough with antibiotic prescriptions obtained FROM physicians).
<BR>
Interestingly, the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic act cited in the article
<BR>
below was passed before antibiotics became available on a large scale basis.
<BR>
<P>So, there may be no easy answers here..but if medical groups and Si Valley
<BR>
VC types square off against each other...I'm not sure there would be ANY
<BR>
winners.

<EM>&gt;I published the following in the NYT on 1/3/00. I am curious about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deafening silence with which the Internet community has greeted this issue.

I

<EM>&gt;Sometimes the Patient Knows Best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;By Virginia Postrel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;January 3, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LOS ANGELES -- The Internet's abundance -- of information, goods, tastes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and sources of authority -- creates unparalleled opportunities for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals to get exactly what they want. But this plenitude threatens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political and cultural authorities who believe in telling individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what they can have rather than letting them choose for themselves. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was inevitable, therefore, that the growth of the Internet would lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complaints that its diversity undermines media standards, traditional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;morality and political authority. It was inevitable that the Internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would face calls for censorship.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And it was equally inevitable that the Internet would clash with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;American pharmaceutical regulations. The United States government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approaches patient choice in medication as Singapore does free speech:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its pronouncements sound reasonable and tolerant until you threaten its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prerogatives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Internet ethos of diversity and competition runs exactly counter to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uniform, gatekeeper-oriented medical culture -- the technocratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy of the &quot;one best way&quot; embodied in our pharmaceutical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regulations. On the Net, medical information is abundant and pharmacies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;domestic and foreign, operate on many different models.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now President Clinton is calling for new laws to require pharmacy Web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sites to get licenses from the Food and Drug Administration before they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can go online. He also wants large new federal fines, up to $500,000 per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sale, for selling prescription drugs &quot;without a valid prescription.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Determining what's &quot;valid&quot; would put the federal government in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;business of regulating medical practice. To enforce these new rules, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;administration would give the F.D.A. subpoena powers and $10 million in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fiscal 2001.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Clinton initiative would greatly expand federal control over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cyberspace while nationalizing state-level pharmacy regulations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common law standards of medical care. High-profile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;venture-capital-backed Internet pharmacies like Drugstore.com and Planet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Rx.com support the initiative's general philosophy and goals but have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expressed concern about whether new federal powers are necessary. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;favor stricter enforcement of existing laws. These sites operate within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traditional procedures, requiring a prescription from the patient's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal physician.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But other online pharmacies let customers fill out questionnaires about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their health and get prescriptions from doctors without in-person exams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These sites range from shadowy operations without known addresses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well-established brick-and-mortar businesses like the Pill Box, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;five-store chain based in San Antonio. They tend to specialize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so-called lifestyle drugs like the anti-impotence treatment Viagra and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the anti-baldness drug Propecia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Food and Drug Administration calls them rogue sites, and government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;officials claim they victimize customers. Janet Woodcock, director of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told a House
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;committee in July: &quot;A system of drug regulation was established in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;country that has served us well. But even with this system in place,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are those who still try to sell unapproved or unsafe drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;products, and the Internet provides them with new opportunities for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reaching unsuspecting and vulnerable consumers and undermining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;established safeguards,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fraudulent operators exist, of course, but their products and practices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are well covered by existing laws. The threat to the power of regulators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comes from sites that benefit customers who don't feel well served by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the established system. A significant number of Americans obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prefer the privacy and convenience of a Web-based medical consultation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the invasiveness and hassle of a physician visit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While they may go to the doctor for diagnosis and treatment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conventional illnesses, these consumers don't see their sex lives or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;baldness as requiring physical exams. Regulators also tend to idealize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in-person exams, as though every doctor took a careful history and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thoroughly examined a patient before prescribing any drug.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The White House claims that &quot;in cyberspace, consumers have no way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telling whether an online pharmacy is a legitimate operation.&quot; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isn't true. Brand reputations, contact numbers and street addresses, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a pharmacy association certification program are all indicators that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;business is sound.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The F.D.A. itself offers useful advice to help consumers evaluate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pharmacy sites. The real issue is that not all consumers agree on what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is &quot;legitimate.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Internet pharmacies return to consumers the choice promised by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supporters of the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. That law established
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;federal requirements for drug safety and labeling but exempted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prescription medicines from the labeling rules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The bill was sold as a way to help consumers make informed choices about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their medications, not as a way to transfer those choices to physicians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drug makers and regulators. The goal, W. G. Campbell, then head of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;F.D.A., told a Senate committee, was merely &quot;to make self-medication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;safe.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The government broke that promise. As the Massachusetts Institute of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Technology economist Peter Temin recounted in &quot;Taking Your Medicine,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his 1980 book on drug regulation, &quot;The agency moved within six months of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the bill's passage to curtail self-medication sharply and thereafter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used a substantial and increasing proportion of its drug resources to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enforce its imposed limitations.&quot; The agency created a new class of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;medicines that could be sold only by prescription -- a category that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;greatly expanded over the succeeding decades. In doing so, Mr. Temin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrote, it &quot;appointed doctors as the consumers' purchasing agents.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Internet partially restores patients' rights to choose how they buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their medications and from whom. No wonder the drug censors are so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;upset.
