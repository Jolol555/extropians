<BR>
<P><P>Tim,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I understood your point. And I still think your point is pernicious.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not sure that you understand my point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The very notion of &quot;perfection means rights won't be needed&quot; is what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pernicious. Seen frequently in the gun debate. (&quot;If we lived in a perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society, guns would not be needed and there would be no need for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Second Amendment.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not intend to suggest that rights won't be needed when there is
<BR>
perfection. I would suggest that the path towards perfection involves the
<BR>
continuing development of rights; I would then suggest that issue is perhaps
<BR>
the mechanisms used to maintain the stability of those rights.
<BR>
<P>Spears, Slingshots, Catapults, Tanks, Guns, Genetic Agents, Computing
<BR>
Agents, Secret Services, Cryptographic Agents are all tools that are
<BR>
plausable mechanisms to maintain and develop rights, but each are of certain
<BR>
levels of effectiveness at certain times in history, and each are desirable
<BR>
or undesirable (e.g. non-violent action is preferred, but unfortunately
<BR>
violent action may be needed if the situation demands it). Catapults are of
<BR>
limited effectiveness in a modern society. Guns may eventually lose
<BR>
effectivness due to genetic, physical and computing advances (or may exist
<BR>
&quot;in principle&quot;: molecular disruptors). The same may occur with cryptography,
<BR>
it may  exist &quot;in principle&quot;, but in a further advanced form: quantum
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>That is the big picture. Most people are concerned about the short to medium
<BR>
term picture, to ensure that in 30-40 years time they will still live a
<BR>
&quot;good life&quot;. Even that, becomes an issue, because with life extension
<BR>
technologies, I may eventually be able to live a somewhat immortal life.
<BR>
Which means, then, perhaps I should be concerned with the big picture ?
<BR>
<P>The points from this are:
<BR>
- - perfection inherently includes the notion of satisfiable rights, because
<BR>
it can be seen as the development of rights towards a suitably satisfactory
<BR>
state.
<BR>
- - satisfiable rights inherently include mechanisms to maintain such
<BR>
rights, because without structual integrity, such rights may regress or
<BR>
erode.
<BR>
- - the mechanisms to maintain these rights develop and change as society
<BR>
changes; obsoleting the usefulness of certain technologies at certain times,
<BR>
and all it takes is one other party to advance to new technologies, and
<BR>
everyone else is forced to advance (in some form, e.g. arms race or
<BR>
bilateral agreements) as well, lest anyone be left in a vulnerable/weak
<BR>
position.
<BR>
<P>Fundamentally:
<BR>
- - the digital world is entirely digital, and in the digital world, some
<BR>
form of cryptography is the basis for all manner of rights (transport
<BR>
protocols are basic &quot;rights&quot; between communication systems, QoS parameters
<BR>
can be seen as more advanced forms of rights, cryptographic parameters and
<BR>
systems are even more advancesd forms of rights, and then smart contracts,
<BR>
nym systems and everything else are continually evolution of rights towards
<BR>
digital entities, where digital entities are autonomous sentient entities
<BR>
that can operate and mediate and wield &quot;power&quot; through their use of
<BR>
cryptographic mechanisms).
<BR>
<P>[does anyone want to fund me full time to study this, it's killing my social
<BR>
life as a hobby :-)]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Whether or not we can ever achieve &quot;perfection&quot; is not the issue. What is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong-headed is the very line of reasoning you have used.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think perfection is an ideal model, important to use as a reasoning tool
<BR>
to frame reality, or to trade off and look at versions of reality, and
<BR>
therefore make decisions about the best sorts of reality. There is an
<BR>
analogy here with models of computability. The models are ideal and not
<BR>
necessarily correct or reachable, but they provide a good way to develop
<BR>
metrics and make tradeoffs for the realistic results.
<BR>
I do not think that you understand the line of reasoning that I am using. I
<BR>
do think that perhaps I have not expressed my reasoning very well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am not interested in trying to persuade you otherwise, so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't comment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any further in this thread. I just had to point out how deeply flawed your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole manifesto is to some of us (hopefully _most_ of us).
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not a manifesto I subscribe to, but it is a point of discussion to
<BR>
understand the problem further, that is all. A philosophical question often
<BR>
resolves around the nature of how people interpret what other people say.
<BR>
Some people assume that what people say is an absolute statement of that
<BR>
persons beliefs, when sometimes people say things to provoke reaction and
<BR>
discussion. This is why extremists, whether you like them or not, or agree
<BR>
with them, are often useful -- and actually desirable -- as a catalyst for
<BR>
action. The nature of the way in which the extremists go about there
<BR>
activities is an issue, though. Draw a similarity to revolutionaries, who
<BR>
are extremists. I hope that my use of analogies helps refine my reasoning.
<BR>
<P>I agree, no further comment from myself. Interested parties can take the
<BR>
discussion up with me in personal email. I have more thinking to do. Perhaps
<BR>
it was good to shout to see what response I received.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Matthew.
