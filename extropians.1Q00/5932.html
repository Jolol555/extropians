<EM>&gt; &gt;EvMick might also consider like keeping an extra copy of something really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;accessible to all -- like _The First Immortal_ -- to give away.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not, if I did this, act like a salesman with free samples.  Instead, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would just always have a copy in my truck and pass it along.  At about $7
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pop, it's not too expensive and the novel itself, though not the best in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;terms of new ideas per page, is probably good for anyone, even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reader is not all that interested in science fiction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sad to say, TFI would probably be high on my list for giveaways as well,
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lack of anything to substitute.  I profoundly disagree, however, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Halperin's sense of life and politics,
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with Phil on the second point here.  Halperin's politics are just
<BR>
moderate Republicanism -- in American terms, here -- and pretty lame at
<BR>
that.  His &quot;sense of life&quot; I thought okay, though a bit too pollyanna.
<BR>
Recall, the reason I recommend the book, however, is not because it's great
<BR>
science fiction, but because it's accessible, especially to people who
<BR>
aren't into science fiction.
<BR>
<P>(For the record, I haven't read a heck of a lot of cryonics novels, but I
<BR>
think the best of the few I have read is Charles Platt's _The Silicon Man_.
<BR>
BUT I don't think most non-science fiction readers could get into that
<BR>
novel.  I think they would see it, as many people who don't like science
<BR>
fiction have told me of other novels, stories, etc., as too technology- and
<BR>
science-centered.  They might also be put off by the politics of the
<BR>
anarchist character.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and his actual writing style is of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kind that originally gave SF a bad name - although it's certainly
</EM><BR>
readable.
<BR>
<P>Yes.  I'm talking, as I reiterate above, about the average reader -- not the
<BR>
science fiction fan or the dude who has a degree in English Lit.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The worst thing, however, which was also the case with The Truth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Machine, is that these &quot;novels&quot; are in fact thinly disguised propaganda
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Drexlerian elitist technocratic camp.  I know something of the origins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of both novels, as it was I who laid out the plot for TTM to Halperin back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 1980, and I vaguely recall suggesting that if the novel succeeded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then he might consider a follow-up focusing on cryonics.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not read _The Truth Machine_, so I can't say whether Phil is right here
<BR>
on what type of a novel it is.  I do agree that _The First Immortal_ is,
<BR>
basically, naked propaganda.  Again, I would not recommend it for its
<BR>
literary or political value...  Just to open minds to cryonics and related
<BR>
ideas.
<BR>
<P>L8R!
