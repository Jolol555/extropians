wrote regarding Re: American Imperialism?:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Right, that is *not* imperialism.  Imperialism is extending a nation's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of 
</EM><BR>
economic and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; political hegemony over other nations.  The US is not doing this.  We 
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; basically acting as the referee in the world's international wrestling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matches, and enforcing the rules when we notice low blows.  No, no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appointed us as the referee, but we're the biggest kid on the block 
</EM><BR>
and have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; assumed the role of shot caller by default.  Maybe its a good thing, 
</EM><BR>
maybe
<BR>
<EM>&gt; its not.  But it is definitely *not* imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<P>I sincerely wish the U.S., was doing what you say, but unfortunately 
<BR>
the U.S. is still a very imperialist and interventionist country.
<BR>
<P>However please note, That this is because of the way the government 
<BR>
handles
<BR>
international issues and I'm sure more Americans oppose to imperialism 
<BR>
and most
<BR>
most of it's current foreign policies, than those who advocate them.
<BR>
<P><P>But unfortunately when you live in America, you don't get all the 
<BR>
information 
<BR>
about the things that happen in our regions of the world.
<BR>
<P>Speaking of my country (Mexico) 
<BR>
Although after the end of the usa/Mexico war when we lost more than 
<BR>
half our
<BR>
territory the usa has never invaded or threatened us militarily, 
<BR>
they've forced
<BR>
us to do what they think it's better using all sorts of resources or 
<BR>
excuses.
<BR>
<P>An example of this is the certification measure, here in Mexico every 
<BR>
time the 
<BR>
congress up there is deciding if we'll get or not certified. it 
<BR>
creates a lot of
<BR>
tension and hurts our relations because it's an unilateral procedure 
<BR>
based on
<BR>
U.S. Interests only and not ours, but they still implement it, because 
<BR>
it's
<BR>
easier to use scape goats and pretend they are combating drug abuse by 
<BR>
being tough
<BR>
on poor defenseless countries instead of looking wiser alternatives to 
<BR>
this senseless
<BR>
drug war, and I could quote several other examples (operation 
<BR>
casablanca, etc.) 
<BR>
that the U.S. government does to force us their beliefs or systems.
<BR>
<P>And well to avoid unnecessary rants, I'll just say is not very fair 
<BR>
for a country to
<BR>
use it's enormous military or economic power to force other countries 
<BR>
do things they
<BR>
don't like, and that in my opinion is... imperialism, call it neo 
<BR>
imperialism if you want
<BR>
but it still doesn't make it any less worse.
<BR>
<P>A lot of people in this world go to jail or suffer unnecesarily, just 
<BR>
because the American
<BR>
government in their big brother approach. Think people, aren't mature 
<BR>
and rational enough
<BR>
to know what they should and shouldn't use or do with their lifes, and 
<BR>
that everybody
<BR>
needs to be protected against the &quot;dangers&quot; of drugs/communism/insert 
<BR>
your favorite excuse here.
<BR>
<P>However don't get the wrong message here, I know there are governments 
<BR>
who are or would be a lot worse
<BR>
if they could, and that our corrupt government has as much fault as 
<BR>
the usa in all this, and
<BR>
I'm 99% certain that if our government (knowing their habits) had the 
<BR>
power of the U.S. Would
<BR>
be a lot worse... However, that is no excuse to overlook what the 
<BR>
American government likes to do
<BR>
with other countries (or their own people sometimes) in the name of 
<BR>
justice and peace.
<BR>
<P>But being a bit more positive I think that with the arrival of the 
<BR>
Internet, globalization and
<BR>
meme generators like this list, we'll see the end of imperialism as we 
<BR>
know it.
<BR>
<P>Any comments?
