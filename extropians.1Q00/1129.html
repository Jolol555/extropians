<P>
Robin forwarded a provocative article by Charles Murray:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;National Review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;January 24, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We, Homo sapiens, are about to learn how to alter human nature at roughly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same time that we finally learn for sure what that nature is.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to say, though, that overall I thought the tone was thoroughly
<BR>
obnoxious.  Murray sees the world in rigid ideological terms of Right
<BR>
vs Left which IMO will not have that much relevance as we move forward.
<BR>
<P>He is no doubt right that we will learn a great deal about human nature
<BR>
and the determinates of behavior over the next decades.  But he describes
<BR>
these revelations almost purely in genetic terms.  He focuses on what
<BR>
we will learn about what our genes have to say, ignoring what we will
<BR>
learn about memes, culture and other environmental influences.
<BR>
<P>And he basis his analysis on groups and classes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We will learn for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain such things as that women innately make better nurturers of small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children than do men and that men innately make better soldiers than do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women.
</EM><BR>
<P>Leaving aside Murray's smug assumption that science will confirm his
<BR>
personal preferences, his logic is very questionable.  Maybe what he
<BR>
says here will be true, in some sense, but as Murray recognizes later in
<BR>
his article, the knowledge we gain will not be expressed in these terms.
<BR>
Our knowledge will be far broader and at the same time far more specific.
<BR>
We will be able to take an individual and, given knowledge of his brain
<BR>
state, background and genetics, say whether he would make a good nurturer
<BR>
or soldier.
<BR>
<P>It is unquestionably true, and I am sure Murray would agree, that even if
<BR>
his assumptions are correct, some men will be better nurturers than many
<BR>
women, and some women will be better soldiers than many men.  But this
<BR>
is not consistent with his claim that the Right will be vindicated over
<BR>
the Left:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Regarding these and many other human characteristics impinging on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marriage, the upbringing of children, and the enforcement of social order, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am predicting that the adages of the Right will usually prove to be closer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the mark than the adages of the Left, and that many of the causes of the Left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be revealed as incompatible with the way human beings are wired.
</EM><BR>
<P>Won't this evidence for diverse individual differences justify the
<BR>
Left's desire to let women be soldiers and men be homemakers, if
<BR>
they choose?  It was the conservatives who fought for the old order
<BR>
where each individual's choices in life were largely determined by his
<BR>
social groups.  The liberals were the ones who attempted to open the
<BR>
system and let everyone have equal opportunity.  I don't think it can be
<BR>
considered a victory for the Right to have scientific proof that some
<BR>
women are suitable for combat, but there seems little doubt that this
<BR>
is what will happen.
<BR>
<P>And last I must object vehemently to his claim that the Left will
<BR>
support eugenics.  This is a transparent bit of mud flinging, a vicious
<BR>
rhetorical swipe at his enemies by linking them with Nazi ideology.
<BR>
<P>It is highly questionable that the Left will embrace human genetic
<BR>
engineering, and that they will support government policies to force
<BR>
everyone to be engineered, as Murray claims.  In fact we see the opposite
<BR>
today, as opposition to all forms of genetic engineering comes mostly
<BR>
from the environmentalists, with the religious right joining the cause
<BR>
when it comes to human experimentation.
<BR>
<P>Murray even admits that people, if allowed to choose freely, will want
<BR>
to give their children enhancements, and he is willing to endorse this
<BR>
if it does not go too far:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;voluntary uses of gene manipulation are likely to be ones that avoid birth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defects and ones that lead to improved overall physical and mental abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I find it hard to get upset about that prospect.
</EM><BR>
<P>By his logic that makes him a eugenicist.  Somehow he neglects to point
<BR>
this out.
<BR>
<P>At some level I have to give Murray credit.  He's an old man and he's
<BR>
trying to come to grips with changes which will redefine what it means
<BR>
to be human.  But he can't help but continue to fight his old battles.
<BR>
Like many people who write about the future, he is really making a
<BR>
statement about the present.  He can't resist the temptations to take
<BR>
jabs at his opponents, and ultimately that is all he has done here.
<BR>
