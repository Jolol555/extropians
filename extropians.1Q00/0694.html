<P>
I wrote most of the following as a response directly to Damien,
<BR>
but I realized that many people on the list might be interested
<BR>
in it.  So for what its worth...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Subject: Commentary on THE SPIKE edits.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... To put the matter cudely: putting your nest egg into nanotechnology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... counterfeit money, or turn lead into gold... imagine the inflationary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences...
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this is very thin.  You have to consider that &quot;counterfeiting&quot;
<BR>
is exchanging something of little value (worthless paper) for something
<BR>
of great value (hard goods).  On the other hand, a nanotech economy
<BR>
is going to be exchanging something of &quot;presumed value&quot; (monetary
<BR>
equivalents) for something of &quot;equal&quot; value (nanostuff).  The relative
<BR>
values will be determined by standard economic laws of supply and
<BR>
demand just as Robin has suggested.  Note that Eric has never said
<BR>
things will be free, just that complex &quot;stuff&quot; should decrease to
<BR>
the cost of &quot;bulk&quot; stuff.  Even things like sand and salt for the
<BR>
streets of Moscow are not &quot;free&quot;.  You just get very interesting
<BR>
changes in the cost equation that have to be subject to ROI analysis.
<BR>
For the price of one-time costs, you can engineer a layer of energy-storing
<BR>
and releasing surface coatings, paint them onto the street and
<BR>
forget about them for 20 years.  But these will only be used if the
<BR>
costs of design, test, production and application are lower than
<BR>
the costs of &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;salt&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>The trends towards hyper-low cost technologies are present now
<BR>
(i.e. no &quot;minting&quot; required) in microchips.  When chips with unique
<BR>
IDs, GPS locators, out-of-the-store suppresion range self-position
<BR>
auto-broadcasting capabilities are available and relatively cheap
<BR>
($.50-$.01) each, they will be applied to everything in a store and
<BR>
shoplifting will cease.  Micro-electronics &amp; Micro-Mems are on
<BR>
similar curves (the latter following the former), as the volumes go up,
<BR>
the costs decrease and the applications explode.  Its worth noting
<BR>
that the obsolete Micro-electronics foundary becomes a state-of-the-art
<BR>
Mems foundary, so those considerations (Whitesides?) of $10-billion
<BR>
FAB costs ignore the possible reuses of such fabs in alternate arenas.
<BR>
For example, the typical analysis of the fab costs ignores the residual
<BR>
value of a fab making state-of-the-art microprocessors for 2-4 years
<BR>
followed by a 2-4 year lifetime making lower ROI ICs (in larger volumes
<BR>
due to their decreased size), followed by an unknown lifetime producing
<BR>
alternate applications (MEMS, etc.) we can't even imagine yet.
<BR>
Due to the extraordinary difficulty predicting market size and
<BR>
sales of products in the 2-5 year future time frame, it is *very*
<BR>
difficult to say whether $10B fabs are lemons or cash cows.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Re: Barry Jones &amp; &quot;exponential rise in output together with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exponential fall in total inputs&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Its worth noting that this *only* works until the market is saturated.
<BR>
I'd agree with Robin, that all of economic history has been about
<BR>
exponential growth and decreasing the total cost of inputs.
<BR>
<P>There are two forces at work here (1) Growth in Market size causing
<BR>
decreases in costs, causing expansion in market size.  Seen most
<BR>
clearly in the early days of the automobile (Ford, I think is
<BR>
attributed as saying, for every doubling in market size, there
<BR>
was a halving of costs.)  This is currently a major part of the
<BR>
driving force in the computer industry.  (2) Miniaturization, as
<BR>
you mention, allowing you to produce &quot;more&quot; with the same raw materials.
<BR>
<P>Its interesting to compare the auto &amp; microelectronics industries.
<BR>
While the former is halving car mass perhaps every 20-40 years,
<BR>
the later is effectively halving mass (chip area) every couple
<BR>
of years.  The difference is simple in that you couldn't reduce
<BR>
car size beyond that of &quot;people&quot;, while in microchips you can
<BR>
go down to atomic sizes before things get really hard.
<BR>
Because the microelectronics industry has much farther to go
<BR>
before hitting bottom, it is more likely that the costs will
<BR>
allow everyone to afford computers, long before everyone
<BR>
can afford a car (until minting steps in).
<BR>
<P>I don't know if you separate things out, but there are 3 aspects
<BR>
of minting -- self-replication, self-assembly and molecular assembly.
<BR>
We will borrow from nature methods for doing the first two before we
<BR>
master the third.  That means the really hard part (&quot;diamondoid&quot; molecular
<BR>
nanoassembly) is divorced from much of the economic consequences!!!
<BR>
<P>If we can get &quot;programmable&quot; self-replication we get the costs of
<BR>
most &quot;parts&quot; down to the costs of wood, agricultural products, etc.
<BR>
or even lower because we can produce them off of waste materials.
<BR>
If we can get &quot;programmable&quot; self-assembly, we eliminate much
<BR>
of the human &quot;labor&quot; costs in putting things together (this
<BR>
is a logical continuation of Apple's &quot;automated&quot; Mac plants,
<BR>
Japanese Car factories, etc. with the difference being that
<BR>
you build the &quot;intelligence&quot; of how to assemble into the parts
<BR>
themselves.  So the really hard part of MNTing (the construction
<BR>
of a diamondoid biochemistry system) is *only* required if you
<BR>
want to build stronger &amp; lighter structures than required for
<BR>
most current activities.  So, dMNTing isn't required for food
<BR>
production or most energy production (from solar, wind, waves)
<BR>
or most housing.  Building high-rise buildings is limited to
<BR>
the strength of materials like bone, hydroxyapatite (teeth),
<BR>
sea-shells, bamboo, etc.  These are only &quot;somewhat&quot; lower than
<BR>
things like steel &amp; concrete.  But I think you could see how
<BR>
semi-intelligent pieces of steel or concrete could self-assemble
<BR>
or how bamboo-beamed houses could &quot;grow&quot; themselves.
<BR>
<P>If you want to throw down the gauntlet with respect to MNTing,
<BR>
you need to break it up into separate areas, each of which provides
<BR>
distinct economic benefits.  That makes it harder for critics
<BR>
to attack since they have to attack all of the legs it stands on.
<BR>
It makes it more viable from an economic investment standpoint
<BR>
because different groups of investors will invest in different
<BR>
aspects.  Biotech literate people will invest in self-replication.
<BR>
Robotics/MEMS/Construction literate people will invest in self-assembly.
<BR>
Materials engineers and the people who need the absolute limits of
<BR>
performance (military, rocket builders, etc.) will invest in dMNTing.
<BR>
<P><P>The three areas will develop at different rates but once mature
<BR>
will allow a large amount of borrowing and cross-pollenization
<BR>
that merges the advantages of each field.
<BR>
<P>Getting back to Barry Jones and the &quot;exponential fall&quot; of total
<BR>
inputs.  I question this.  Presumably what happens is the
<BR>
recognition of the most &quot;expensive&quot; parts of the production cost
<BR>
(labor, capital, energy, space, etc.) and a gradual substituation
<BR>
of some other &quot;cheaper&quot; component.  If labor is expensive, you
<BR>
invest in labor saving automation.  If energy is expensive, you
<BR>
borrow capital to design less energy intensive ways of performing
<BR>
the production.  If space is expensive you move to a country
<BR>
with lots of land.  The key factors are knowing how large your
<BR>
market is or will grow and the relative growth rates.  It would
<BR>
be interesting for Robin or someone else to comment on market
<BR>
&quot;saturation&quot; economics.  I think you have to deal with the
<BR>
declining returns on substitutions.  Exponential sales growth
<BR>
(to previous non-owners) is relatively simple compared with
<BR>
exponential decreases in input costs.  One involves &quot;sales&quot;
<BR>
while the other involves increasingly difficult cost analysis
<BR>
and engineering.  The curves may be exponential, but they
<BR>
have different exponents and different limits.
<BR>
<P><P>The major factor, as implied by Anders, and perhaps others is the
<BR>
rapidity with which markets &quot;saturate&quot; in the SPIKE era.  I may own
<BR>
2 or 3 or 4 copies of &quot;typical&quot; consumer goods if I'm maintaining
<BR>
apartments or houses in that many cities but once I've got 1 of each
<BR>
in each location, sales of the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;improved&quot; models are likely
<BR>
to be very difficult.  This becomes even worse if most of what you are
<BR>
selling has to compete with open source &quot;software&quot; that is downloadable.
<BR>
&quot;Reconfigurable&quot; matter is going to significantly impact the development
<BR>
and sales paradigms.  After my general needs are met, you have to
<BR>
move innovation from &quot;more&quot; (of the same) to *much* better, or
<BR>
*very* different to make a sale.  I can see this today in an average
<BR>
store in Moscow.  A typical electronic coffee grinder may cost
<BR>
~$30-40, while an old, &quot;unique, elaborate&quot; hand-grind coffee grinder
<BR>
may cost $120+.  You pay a premium for the low-volume, &quot;unique&quot;
<BR>
sales items.  The sales paradigms we have today don't change,
<BR>
they just get shifted onto different technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Re: &quot;bloatware, sloppy or massively redundant code requiring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colossal extra amounts of computing grunt to do pretty much the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same jobs about as well.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't really what bloatware is all about.  Bloatware is about
<BR>
adding functionality for a decreasing fraction of the user base.
<BR>
For example, I really *care* if my OCR program recognizes superscripts,
<BR>
subscripts and Greek letters.  The average person cares much more
<BR>
if it can accurately scan a fax or enter a &quot;form&quot;.  Many people &quot;caring&quot;
<BR>
results in a bigger program to handle all of the special cases.  *If* the
<BR>
market is big enough, there is an incentive for developers to handle those
<BR>
special cases (just as we look for &quot;employees&quot; who understand the
<BR>
terminology or protocols in specific areas of human activity).
<BR>
While the programs may get bigger, this is easily fixed with &quot;download
<BR>
on demand&quot; software.
<BR>
<P>Now, I will *freely* admit that major software developers are &quot;stupid&quot;.
<BR>
For example Microsoft, &quot;re-invented&quot; their spell checker in FrontPage
<BR>
so it doesn't take advantage of all of the previous development in
<BR>
the spell checker in Microsoft Word.  But given my experience in major
<BR>
software organizations, after a couple of iterations, they will usually
<BR>
get the re-usable code paradigm correct.
<BR>
<P>Net result, software will grow until it has the capacity sufficient
<BR>
to handle *most* cases found in human experience.  Case in point --
<BR>
we now have ISO fonts that handle most major languages as well as
<BR>
a bigger 16-bit &quot;universal font&quot;.  Language &quot;specificities&quot; is a
<BR>
relatively &quot;solved&quot; problem, so those fonts will grow marginally,
<BR>
if at all in the future.  The computer world is still playing catch-up
<BR>
to the variety in the real world, once the knowledge bases are relatively
<BR>
equalized, the &quot;bloat&quot; growth will match the true creativity growth.
<BR>
Another example would be cross-language dictionaries.  Once all of
<BR>
the human languages have cross-language translations that can be
<BR>
stored in an inexpensive amount of memory, this &quot;bloat&quot; growth will
<BR>
cease.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Re: free assemblers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (from ... Meanwhile, the cost of refitting fabrication plants to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chips at smaller and denser ..... assembler machines that literally compile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material objects, including more of themselve?  Where's the profit in that?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, this kind of assumes there is a single race that can be &quot;won&quot;.
<BR>
As I've pointed out previously, with self-replication, self-assembly
<BR>
and dMNTing, there are a number of races.  Furthermore, if you really
<BR>
understand dMNTing, you understand that it *IS NOT* a one-size fits
<BR>
all solution.  For starters, you've got dMNTing, SaphireMNTing and
<BR>
TungstenCarbideMNTing.  Each of which operates as successively higher
<BR>
temperatures and requires a totally different biochemistry (feedstock,
<BR>
tool-tips, energy sources, etc.)  Whether you can use one level of
<BR>
MNTing to enable the next higher level remains a very open question.
<BR>
Now on a completely orthogonal axis is presumably energy efficiency
<BR>
with regard to MNTing (something Eric is aware of but marginalizes).
<BR>
Energy will never be &quot;free&quot;.  The less energy you devote to MNT assembly,
<BR>
the more you can devote to &quot;computing/thinking&quot;.  So there will be
<BR>
an ongoing incentive to reduce the costs of MNT assembly.  If you look
<BR>
at the biochemistry of current MNT (bacteria, eukaryotic cells, etc.)
<BR>
there is a very significant emphasis placed on energy efficiency.
<BR>
If you can grow more with less energy, you get &quot;ahead&quot; in the game
<BR>
of life.  That implies that even if you can do dMNT, doing dMNT
<BR>
or sMNT or tcMNT &quot;cheaper&quot; than the next fellow will give you a
<BR>
big marketing advantage.  So, the corporate CEO stands up and says
<BR>
&quot;We can do dMNT!!!&quot;.  I'll be in the back of the crowd raising my
<BR>
hand and asking &quot;... and what are your energy losses....&quot;.  For
<BR>
every &quot;success&quot; there is an opportunity for the competition.
<BR>
If I can do it &quot;cheaper&quot; than he can, I can eat his lunch.
