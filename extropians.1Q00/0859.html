<P>
'What is your name?'  'Enigl@aol.com.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Except that they, the relativists, are not scientists or philosophers of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science.  Can you name one either way?
</EM><BR>
<P>Name one what?  Relativist?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They &quot;give up&quot; on Hume's problem -- that hardly solves the problem.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, PCR/CCR has _no_ first principles at all. . . that is the answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to relavitism's claim that nothing can be proven without unjustified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first assumptions.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're reading a different book.  I'm not talking about SKEPTICISM, I'm
<BR>
talking about RELATIVISM.  They're commonly lumped together by empiricists
<BR>
like yourself. ;)
<BR>
<P>No, relativists claim that truth is in some important way relative to the
<BR>
context of the question/statement.  In moral theory, for example, you have
<BR>
relativists who claim that morality is determined within a given culture,
<BR>
but that there is no universal Right; there's just right-for-your-culture,
<BR>
right-for-my-culture, right-for-the-Germans, right-for-the-Moslems, etc.
<BR>
(Contrast this with the view that we have no way of *knowing* what is
<BR>
right.)
<BR>
<P>Similarly, extending this idea to epistemology, you have people like Kuhn
<BR>
and Feyerabend arguing that there is no truth at all, even so-called
<BR>
&quot;scientific&quot; truth, except that which is relative to customs and other
<BR>
cultural factors.  On this account, there is no Rationality when you're
<BR>
considering what constitutes good evidence and what doesn't.  Take, for
<BR>
example, the Copernican revolution.  On this account, there is no
<BR>
Rationality to which Copernicus and Galileo were adhering and to which the
<BR>
leading intellectuals of that day were not adhering; instead, there is
<BR>
merely rational-for-the-Church, rational-for-Galileo, etc.
<BR>
<P>Think of it as a descriptivism for rationality, eh?
<BR>
<P>To see closer up how PCR leads one to this conclusion, notice that to the
<BR>
extent that we're calling PCR an epistemology, it determines when we're
<BR>
justified in claiming &quot;knowledge.&quot;  That is, it's a sufficient answer to
<BR>
the question &quot;how do you know?&quot; to say &quot;well, I'm a pancritical
<BR>
rationalist, and this view, though criticizable, has withstood criticism,
<BR>
and that's how I know.&quot;  But then we get to ask what constitutes valid
<BR>
criticism.  Max More gives a handful of reasonable-sounding principles in
<BR>
his discussion of PCR on the ExI website, (does it conform to sense data?  
<BR>
is it simple?  is it self-consistent?) but you'll notice that he left off
<BR>
the criterion of agreeing with Scripture.
<BR>
<P>Now, your first reaction should be &quot;that's a feature, not a bug!&quot; (I'm an
<BR>
atheist.)  However, under PCR what constitutes valid criticism, while
<BR>
itself up for criticism, is relative to what, in your reflected view,
<BR>
constitutes valid criticism.  (If not, then I can't use the argument I
<BR>
presented above to underwrite my claim that I &quot;know.&quot;)  Suppose the
<BR>
Cardinal says to you that the Earth certainly does NOT move. &quot;Well, how do
<BR>
you know, Cardinal?&quot;  &quot;Because my view has withstood all valid criticism.&quot;  
<BR>
Emphasis on the VALID.  Criticism which doesn't take the truth of
<BR>
Scripture into account, after all, isn't valid...  Ask anyone in the 15th
<BR>
century.
<BR>
<P>Arguments from hindsight (&quot;well, he DIDN'T withstand criticism, now, DID
<BR>
he?&quot;) are not, in this case, 20/20, unless you happen to think that losing
<BR>
the war in memespace happens to be a form of valid criticism.  Of course,
<BR>
if you do, cryonics, extropianism, and Rand's objectivism, all being
<BR>
relatively 'fringe' ideas, must also be regarded as &quot;irrational&quot; on
<BR>
account of THEIR not having won the war.  Arguments of the form &quot;not yet,
<BR>
but our time is coming&quot; could just as easily be applied to the Cardinal's
<BR>
argument, and still IS, surprisingly often!
<BR>
<P>Finally, and this is the argument normally raised against the Cardinal by
<BR>
PCR lovers everywhere, is:  &quot;The Cardinal did not offer the Scripture for
<BR>
criticism.&quot;  To which the Communist cries:  &quot;It was the Cardinal's gravest
<BR>
error.  So, tell me, why have you not signed up for the inevitable utopia?
<BR>
Why have you not offered your LOGIC up for criticism, eh?  The standards
<BR>
of truth are in the hands of experts now.  You'd have to be INSANE to
<BR>
contradict them.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They saybecause of that we can not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prove our own existance.  They basically believe that NO knowledge is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.  Relativism is absurd.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, that's skepticism.  Relativism is completely different.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They claim theoretic statements are not and _can not_ be true, a rational 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; language of science is not possible, and unobservables (e.g., atoms) do not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only the second of those applies to relativists, the claim that a rational
<BR>
language of science is not possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They are opposed to Realism, Instrumentalism, and Descripivism.
</EM><BR>
<P>An odd group...  Do you mean ethical descriptivism?  If so, what can you
<BR>
make of the argument that it was (is?) morally right to believe that the
<BR>
Earth stands still while the heavens move around us?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, relativists don't OPPOSE these ideas, per se, they just argue that
<BR>
their truth is relative to culture, conceptual scheme, or something like
<BR>
that.
