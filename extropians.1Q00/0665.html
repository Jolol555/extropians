<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eliezer, while I applaud Eric and Open Source in general, as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmer I must simply tell you that Open Source *does* have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limitations.  If the complexity is too great, or the underlying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture too poor or the number of people trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneously modify the same code too large (requiring someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to interpret the spagetti that results), then open-source may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be faster, nor work better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Situations like this is _exactly_ where closed source companies
<BR>
foul up and where open source succeeds...
<BR>
<P>If the complexity is too great, the original design was wrong.
<BR>
Commercial software vendors have a schedule to make and their
<BR>
marketing people have been promising things to customers, this
<BR>
means that there's no time to completely redesign the package.
<BR>
Open Source can, and does, take the time for this.
<BR>
<P>Also, with Open Source programmers aren't assigned to a task,
<BR>
so if things get too chaotic because of a large number of
<BR>
people involved, the people who cannot handle that will leave
<BR>
and go work on another project. In closed software vendors
<BR>
those people have to stick to their work and, consequentially,
<BR>
they are the ones who produce the bad code...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This comes down to a fundamental problem that one programmer of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 100 lines of debugged code per day type is worth a lot more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 10 programmers of the 10 lines per day type.  Anyone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked on truely large software projects knows this to be true.  
</EM><BR>
<P>*nod*
<BR>
<P>This is also another point where Open Source is stronger
<BR>
than commercial software. Every (non-opensource) company
<BR>
has to deal with the fact that most of the smart people
<BR>
work for somebody else. Even if your company were to employ
<BR>
5% of the smart people, 95% of the smart people would not be
<BR>
working for you.
<BR>
<P>With Open Source this changes. If one Linux vendor employs
<BR>
5% of the good Open Source developers, that doesn't mean that
<BR>
that company is limited to those developers. Every developer
<BR>
works together with the others, resulting in the fact that a
<BR>
company like Redhat (which pays maybe 5% of the main Linux
<BR>
developers) gets the benefit of _all_ Linux developers...
<BR>
<P>So where any normal company has to deal with a shortage of the
<BR>
100 lines/day people (and often even a shortage of the 10lines/day
<BR>
folks), Open Source companies have more than enough people working
<BR>
on their software. In fact, most `top' Linux developers make money
<BR>
for their company by doing support part of the time.
<BR>
<P>Problems that cannot be solved by the normal support people are
<BR>
fixed by the people that wrote the software in the first place!
<BR>
That's the kind of service that brings in the better support
<BR>
contracts and allows the developers to work on development most
<BR>
of their time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What makes software much better today and allows things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open-source to work is that we have built up the tool base so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have programs to do the stupid stuff (like merging single line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes with no conflicts into open source) and better tools (perl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; + lots others), that make the 100 line/day programmers produce 100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines of much more productive code.
</EM><BR>
<P>True for applications, not true for the operating system or the
<BR>
tools themselves. The kernel, gcc and glibc people (to name a
<BR>
few) are still programming at a fairly low level. Those people
<BR>
are quite rare and I can't imagine a company hiring several
<BR>
dozens of them just because they are needed. (Let alone as many
<BR>
as are now working on just the Linux kernenl, glibc and gcc)
<BR>
<P>The fact that allows us to work more efficient than before is
<BR>
communication. Instant communication over the internet, only
<BR>
hindered by timezones and no longer by company-mandated secrecy
<BR>
or geographical distances.
<BR>
<P>To me, Open Source is primarily about open communication between
<BR>
the people who have to turn wild ideas into reality. I can work
<BR>
together with people from Redhat, SuSE, Linuxcare, NASA, various
<BR>
universities, the company where I'll be working and lots of other
<BR>
people. No NDAs to keep in mind, just sharing and improving upon
<BR>
each other's thoughts.
<BR>
<P>Open minds work better when they're open both ways...
<BR>
<P>cheers,
<BR>
<P>Rik
