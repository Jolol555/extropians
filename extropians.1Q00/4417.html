<EM>&gt; enough. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Moral evolution isn't inevitable, anyway: it's a mis-application of
<BR>
evolutionary theory. Evolution isn't directed -- there's no goal and
<BR>
no progress, just an endless run of new permutations that are then
<BR>
filtered out if they aren't viable in their current context.
<BR>
<P>(I'd like to think that some sort of teleological progress is something
<BR>
that our memes can aspire to, even if our genes are stuck in a Darwinian
<BR>
mire, but that's another matter.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Probably the only viable solution is to make sure the system can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survive huge disasters, that makes these disasters something that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be handled at least partially. Space colonisation is a good first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; step, but currently too expensive to do as a security precaution. With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough nano it is cheaper and viable, but then we have a window of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opportunity between the development of space-applicable nano and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient spread of dangerous technology to make catastrophic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destruction likely whose width is hard to estimate. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
We have survived such a window before -- one that opened (to the
<BR>
public gaze) on August 6th, 1945.
<BR>
<P>While the destructive potential of nano is arguably greater than that
<BR>
of nuclear war, given the slowdown in military procurement since the
<BR>
end of the Cold War I _expect_ the nano industry to be dominated in
<BR>
its early phases by civilian technology development. My hope is that
<BR>
the polycentric world order of today means that we're entering a period
<BR>
like that between 1870 and 1914 when, apart from the battleship race (the
<BR>
ICBMs of the day -- big, expensive, and of militarily dubious utility),
<BR>
the armies of Europe made little technological progress.
<BR>
<P>(Barbed wire, machine guns, and war gas were _all_ available off-the-shelf
<BR>
in 1871, during the Franco-Prussian war -- they became commoner over the
<BR>
next 45 years, but generals in 1914 still believed in cavalry attacks
<BR>
as fervently as they had in 1814, and real progress towards new engines
<BR>
of destruction had to wait until an actual major conflict broke out and
<BR>
the then-extant tools proved inadequate.)
<BR>
<P>If we are lucky, our military will be happy with their smart bombs,
<BR>
F-22's, and stealth bombers until around 2030 or so -- and the nano
<BR>
security problem will be a police/social one rather than one involving
<BR>
weapons of mass destruction. If we're _very_ lucky, the existing
<BR>
political order will disintegrate under the weight of its own internal
<BR>
inconsistencies before there are widespread military applications of 
<BR>
nanotechnology.
<BR>
<P>(You will note that I consider a bureaucracy staffed by diligent,
<BR>
patriotic, loyal, experts to be potentially far more hazardous than
<BR>
a lone maniac. That's because I consider the task of designing and
<BR>
deploying a nanotech weapon to be one that most maniacs don't have
<BR>
the time, energy, money, or intelligence to address -- whereas any
<BR>
study of the history of the cold war, with reference to fun toys
<BR>
like Project Pluto or the NB-36, or Russian counterparts like the
<BR>
YaKHR-7[*], will recognize that the lunacy of a bureaucracy knows no
<BR>
bounds.)
<BR>
<P><P>-- Charlie
<BR>
<P>[*] A fission-powered ICBM. No, I'm not kidding. They got as far as
<BR>
specifying the barium-salt-rich, lead-lined reservoirs in Siberia to
<BR>
crash-land the main engines in -- when flight-testing the thing --
<BR>
before someone pointed out that the idea was to nuke the enemy, not
<BR>
Mother Russia.
<BR>
<P>It was marginally more sane than Project Pluto, though.
