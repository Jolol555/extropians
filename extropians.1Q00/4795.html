<EM>&gt; &gt;Howzabout THIS for not only pejorative, but irretrievably true?  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cruel and cynical actions of the NRA, as distinguished from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Madison Avenue bullshit spindoctor-manufactured Hollywood (Prez
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Charleton Heston?  Yagottabekidding!) image, would lead one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;necessarily believe that the voting majority of their members are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;soulless ghouls who have perpetual hard-ons for and wear their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;emotionally overwrought and bleeding hearts on their sleeves for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lifeless and engineered-for-the-express-purpose-of-death-dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hunks of metal, but cannot muster a shred of sympathy for dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little girls.  They DO sociopathically, and quite obviously, care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more for killing machines than they do for their fellow human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;beings, although to call the rest of the race their &quot;fellows&quot; slurs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rest of humanity by association with pond scum.  It might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impolite to call sick, twisted, demented and bloodthirsty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(&quot;PLEASE, Lord, lemme meet a mugger today and legally kill 'im!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;psychopaths what they are, but the truth, by definition, can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;NEVER be an insult!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I don't think I would have put it *quite* so bluntly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, thats why I haven't roundfiled you yet. Lets keep it that way.
