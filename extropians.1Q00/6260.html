<EM>&gt; &gt;*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and a hell of a lot of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets look at the number of cameras in a total ubiquitous open
<BR>
surveillance system:
<BR>
<P>Range of average camera(at useful resolution): 50 m radius
<BR>
Field of view: 90 degrees
<BR>
Area under surveillance by 1 camera: ~7500 square meters
<BR>
Area of dry surface of Earth: 148,300,000 square kilometers or,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,830,000,000,000,000 square meters
<BR>
Number of cameras necessary to cover every square meter of the dry land
<BR>
on the planet:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras, which if you treat each
<BR>
camera as a network device on an internet like system, would require a
<BR>
network a minimum of approximately 150,000 times larger than the current
<BR>
worldwide internet (but only if you have nothing BUT cameras on the
<BR>
network, no servers, routers, or clients), and is 20 times greater than
<BR>
the capacity of the IP number system's maximum capacity. If you include
<BR>
routers and clients for each of the 6 billion members of the human race,
<BR>
this should add at least another 50 billion IP addresses to the network,
<BR>
assuming that you can put a couple thousand cameras on one router, and
<BR>
one server can handle a million or so cameras at once.
<BR>
<P>Now lets say we use Zero's Rules as a filtration protocol, recapped
<BR>
here:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Notify me whenever:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) someone accesses any of my banking data;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) one of my listed sworn enemies (a) purchases a weapon (b) comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 200 yards of my person (c) comes within two blocks of my house (d) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;accesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; any of my data or (e) speaks my name; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) anyone is watching me by remote surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>1) seems to be pretty easy, and is more of a network/database function
<BR>
than a camera function.
<BR>
<P>2) The enemies list:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) purchases a weapon: unless you have evidence that shows a reasonable
<BR>
threat of imminent harm, then I don't see how you could claim a right to
<BR>
this information, however, it is easily obtainable enough by adding some
<BR>
reporting functions to the NICS database system already in place. In the
<BR>
instance of private sales, any video footage showing a gun in a 2 foot
<BR>
proximity to an 'enemy' would be sufficient, assuming that the weapon in
<BR>
question actually looks like a weapon, and that the system is capable of
<BR>
delineating between dinner knives and a combat knife, a pen and a pen
<BR>
gun, a hand raised in greeting and a hand poised to strike, a walking
<BR>
cane or a beating cane (or a cane with concealed sword or gun), and is
<BR>
able to xray a person and determine if the person has a weapon concealed
<BR>
on their person...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) comes within 200 yds of Zero's person: This is less difficult than
<BR>
monitoring all cameras, so long as your system knows your GIS
<BR>
coordinates at all times, and the GIS coordinates of all enemies at all
<BR>
times, video feeds would only be neccessary to make sure that its
<BR>
actually an enemy and not someone wearing the enemies ID chipset in an
<BR>
effort to confuse and bollux up your complex defense network.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) much like (b), only a limited number of cameras need to be
<BR>
monitored.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) accesses any of my data: This is a toughie, because you really have
<BR>
no idea where in the world any of 'your data' is at any gien moment, and
<BR>
you really have no control over what other people do with 'your data'. I
<BR>
may query your bank info once, then resell it a million times through
<BR>
encrypted channels, unless you want to do away with encryption as well
<BR>
(not likely to happen).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) speaks my name: Ok, then we are adding microphone devices to the
<BR>
network, so the number of IP addy's needed is now double what I
<BR>
calculated for just video feed, and you need voice recognition software
<BR>
that is totally foolproof with all languages and accents and speech
<BR>
impediments ( plus you'll need video sign language translators that can
<BR>
read the couple dozen different sign languages), AND these applications
<BR>
will need to be context sensitive to be able to discriminate between
<BR>
someone actually referring to you, and someone giving a mathematics
<BR>
lecture, or reading a comic book aloud...
<BR>
<P>3) Anyone who is watching you by remote surveillance: relatively
<BR>
impossible, as with microtechnology, 'remote surveillance' could be any
<BR>
bug, bird, etc. that doesn't need to be on your perfect network, and you
<BR>
would need to be able to trace their line of sight communications
<BR>
(another physical impossibility) to their own encrypted private network,
<BR>
break their encryption, and track the signals to the GIS coordinates,
<BR>
through any number of other devices or networks that would be stripping
<BR>
and counterfeiting ID data on the packets, of one of your enemies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But given the technology required for universal surveillance, it should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparatively easy for everyone to have a gizmo strapped to their wrist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitoring vital functions which would trigger an alarm (and nearby cameras)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the event of their demise. Any murderer would be caught &quot;on tape&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police would converge on the location immediately. Even if some kind of slow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poison was used, you could simply rewind the video from the victim's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal camera, find the point when their food was tampered with and again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nail the murderer.
</EM><BR>
<P>First you are assuming that a camera with 360 degree field of view in
<BR>
both the x/y and x/z coordinate planes would have sufficient resolution
<BR>
to record that info, that the persons system would not have been
<BR>
pre-emptively EMPed by a person wishing to do them harm, and that the
<BR>
person wishing to do them harm is either trackable by their own unit
<BR>
(which they likely won't be wearing) or identifiable in video.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, I read recently (sorry, no idea where) about software that was being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed (and already functional) to monitor video-surveillance in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.  The software triggered an alarm when it saw &quot;suspicious&quot; behaviour. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it was still fairly primitive but I seem to remember it was already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capable of recognising the difference between car theft and a normal driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting into their car. In fact, it could even predict (presumably with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fair few false positives) that some one was likely to commit a crime based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their movements / stance etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are algorithms that can discern human beings in a video feed,
<BR>
however this software takes a full PC to run for ONE camera (and no
<BR>
fancy gui's). You can tell by the number of times the person looks
<BR>
around, as well as from their posture, whether they feel guilty about
<BR>
what they are doing, but this also adds significant processing, and DOES
<BR>
generate a large number of false positives, and is easy to overcome if
<BR>
you know what actions the video cues on...

<EM>&gt; &gt; But identifying text is a piece of cake compared to identifying people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Trying to explain what a person looks like to a computer is, as Eliezer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might say, just one step above trying to explain it to a rock.  Today, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't have anything which can do this anywhere near as well as a human can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (to the best of my knowledge; this project is hard, but not impossible).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you'd done very much programming you'd see why this is so hard.  All
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the computer knows is a grid of numbers (a grid which, as we happen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know, corresponds to a grid of colors).  Based on that alone, the computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has to identify what a person looks like.  Notice also that the computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can only use simple arithmetic and set theory to process those numbers. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I want you to imagine a function which uses only arithmetic/logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; operators, (+, *, =, OR, NOT) and membership relations, (X is a member of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; set Y), takes as its input a grid of numbers, and yields as its output a 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if the grid of numbers corresponds to a picture of a person, and a 0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; otherwise.  Can you see how hard this is?  It's not impossible, obviously,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but it's Very difficult.  That's why we still haven't done it thus far.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually there's a system on trial in some nightclubs in (I think) Holland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which automatically compares photos of people who have been banned with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incoming patrons and sounds an alarm if it recognises them. Again, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on a hazy recollection of a news article but I seem to recall that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system was even quite good at seeing through disguises.
</EM><BR>
<P>The system is part of a controlled gate system, so the person always has
<BR>
the same size face, at the same height and distance from the camera in
<BR>
the same lighting conditions.
