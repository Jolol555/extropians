Hi!
<BR>
<P>I must admit the telomerase theory is evolving from an &quot;in vitro&quot; theory to
<BR>
a fully developed &quot;in vivo&quot; theory. Since I presume many amongst you are not
<BR>
aware, I'll present a brief review about the latest information on
<BR>
telomerase (I also need to write a couple of papers and could use the
<BR>
practice).
<BR>
<P>Telomerase has been found to be highly active in cells from non-aging
<BR>
species (namely, lobsters and trouts). This means that, for the first time,
<BR>
we have an &quot;in vivo&quot; indication that telomerase might be used to extend life
<BR>
span. It has long puzzled researcher advocating the telomerase theory that
<BR>
certain mice have longer telomeres than us and yet live 20 or 30 times less.
<BR>
The presence of telomerase in the soma of certain non-aging species is a
<BR>
good argument for the supporters of the telomerase theory (as for the mice,
<BR>
perhaps when we have the results from the mice overexpressing telomerase in
<BR>
the soma we can draw some conclusions). Recent research has also indicates
<BR>
that other processes affect the telomeres and that telomeres are not just a
<BR>
simple cellular clock running from conception to death: (1) It has been
<BR>
shown that other genes affect the size of the telomeres besides telomerase;
<BR>
(2) Xenopus' (a species lacking reproductive senescence) offspring -- not
<BR>
all, only a few cases -- was found to have shorter telomeres than their
<BR>
parents and the telomere length was highly polimorphic when compared between
<BR>
animals of different ages. Other area open for research is the relation
<BR>
between telomeres and DNA repair systems -- there are a few papers
<BR>
indicating a relation but much research is needed. The relation between
<BR>
telomere loss and gene expression is yet another dark area where much
<BR>
research is needded. In conclusion, learning the mechanisms regulating the
<BR>
telomeres will provide useful insights into aging but telomerase itself is
<BR>
only a part of the story.
<BR>
<P>Goodbye, I wish you can find something new and useful in my views.
<BR>
