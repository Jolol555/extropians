<EM>&gt;`playing God' involves twiddling one's thumbs while millions die in extreme

<EM>&gt;agony from horrible diseases.  All this `putting an end to human

<P><EM>&gt;Mormons believe that a big part of the test in this life is the simple 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;horrendous fact that life is so unfair.  It is what we each make of what we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have and whether we get bitter toward God or have faith and do our best to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improve our lot and that of others around us, that is the big challenge.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Religious belief has motivated many people through history to reach out and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to help others, sometimes dedicating whole lives to this, even though it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;meant poverty and a shortened life.  Could this be God's way of reaching out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to help ease the suffering?

<P>Hey, you're absolutely right! So, next time I get the urge to `play God',
<BR>
here's my plan:
<BR>
<P>I'm going to kidnap some small children and hide them in a cellar they
<BR>
can't escape from. They'll never see me, but they'll be able to shout to
<BR>
each other through small holes. Then I'll randomly torment and amuse them,
<BR>
making sure they can hear each others' screams. After a few years, I'll let
<BR>
them out, and they can come and play in my garden where I'll make it all up
<BR>
to them. Assuming any of them are still sane.
