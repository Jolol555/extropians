<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this premise, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of Congress) to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and enact laws that can keep people from suing the gun manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are highly misguided.  [I might be willing to grandfather certain very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; old weapons, but modern day products should be engineered to be safe.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can engineer computers to be protected from misuse by use of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very circuitry the computer is made up of. To protect a gun from misuse,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you will need to install a computer on the gun, that is small enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power supply and all, to not impede the use of the gun. Current research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; models are projected to add a minimum of $1000.00 to the cost of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun if put in production, which also decreases their reliability, as gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recoil is NOT something that electronics are particularly good at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dealing with on a frequent basis, and compact power supplies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notoriously short lived. Additionally, such technology limits the gun's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use to the OWNER. Other family members or employees would not be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, Mike, but Robert wins this one.  The technology to make a gun with
<BR>
a solid-state passive transponder totally immune to recoil and making the
<BR>
gun usable by anyone bearing the properly-coded transceiver (worn as a
<BR>
wristband, ring, cuff link...) could be manufactured for far less than 1%
<BR>
of the cost of the gun.  The NRA should be funding devlopment and gun
<BR>
manufacturers should be advertising these things.
<BR>
<P>I give many thanks that the NRA is protecting my right to use the
<BR>
effective technologies of the day to take responsibility for my life;
<BR>
but it is inexcusable for them to hold back this technology.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
