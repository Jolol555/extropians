<P><P><EM>&gt; Lee has correctly cited Mapp v. Ohio as the genesis of modern exclusionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rule evidence.  Like him, I think that the exclusionary rule appears to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most effective tool developed to date to curb enforcement abuses.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mapp jurisprudence requires a continuing review of law enforcement
</EM><BR>
practice
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by the courts to determine whether &quot;fundamental&quot; rights have been
</EM><BR>
compromised
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by a particular police practice, but they have to do that sort of thing
</EM><BR>
all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly I would agree, even with the negative impact the exclusionary rule
<BR>
may have on law enforcement.  It provides a rather nice example of how,
<BR>
particularly with social/political questions, there are no solutions, merely
<BR>
continuing struggles to find the least of many evils.  &quot;Democracy is the
<BR>
worst form of government, except for all the other forms.&quot;  Ol' Winston did
<BR>
have it right.  And the free society necessarily gives rise to a slew of
<BR>
problems to which there appears only band-aid solutions.  C'est la vie,
<BR>
terrible et libre.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for your practical question, I can tell you as a practicing trial
</EM><BR>
lawyer
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that evidence is either &quot;in&quot; or its &quot;out&quot; - limiting instructions from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bench don't do anything but draw additional attention to the stuff you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to minimize.  As we say down here in Texas, &quot;Once you've swung the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skunk in front of the jury box, you can't get the stink out.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>As I am not a lawyer, this has always struck me as one of the necessary
<BR>
absurdities of judicial policy.  Instructing a jury to ignore certain
<BR>
outburst from witnesses or counsel seems...well...kinda crazy.  But, I can't
<BR>
imagine a better way, though as Eliezer invariably reminds us (and rightly
<BR>
so), there _is_ a better way.  Our obsession with finding and retaining a
<BR>
sterile jury is a noble intent, but impossible in reality.
