<EM>&gt; 1) Have courts enforce a rule that policy makers must always (except for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific exceptions) prefer a market estimate over other sources when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimating matters of fact.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems the most reasonable approach to me, although as I wrote I don't
<BR>
see why it has to be enforced by courts.  Ultimately, if IF proves its
<BR>
value the system should be self enforcing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Have the rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is more than an X (=75%?) chance that a random jury, chosen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twenty years later and paid twice the average wage to study the question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a full year, would agree that D was better than the decision that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have resulted had this market rule not been followed.  Now I can see some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with this, but it relies a lot less on courts to work.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect it would be hard to find this much certainty on most
<BR>
controversial issues.  So this rule would probably not be used much.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) Choose some official national objective function, something like GDP,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only more carefully measured and trying to include more contributions like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the value of leisure, etc.  Have some independent and well monitored agency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continually update this estimate of the state of the nation.  Then have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says that among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the decisions markets are considering (including letting policy makers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do what they want), D gives the highest conditional estimate for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; national objective.  I think this is the most promising approach.
</EM><BR>
<P>Choosing that objective function would be a massive political battle.
<BR>
Chances are people would want to change it from year to year, too, as
<BR>
their concerns change.  Education is the big issue one year; the next
<BR>
it's crime, the next it's taxes, then it's growth.  People wouldn't want
<BR>
to turn their political decisions over to a formula that they couldn't
<BR>
change as needed.
<BR>
<P>But aside from these issues, the more important first step is to
<BR>
have some way for IF to be tested.  I don't think the online game at
<BR>
www.ideosphere.com has had very meaningful results (only a few dozen
<BR>
players are really active at any one time), and my sense from playing
<BR>
the game is that the predictions haven't been noticeably more accurate
<BR>
than those from other sources.
<BR>
<P>If there is to be significant support for using IF in the political
<BR>
process then it must be given an opportunity to prove its worth.  I don't
<BR>
see that happening any time soon.
