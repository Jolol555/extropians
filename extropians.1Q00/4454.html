Maybe its a good idea for the government to restrict access to this tech 
<BR>
until we have evolved to the place where we as a species are a lot more 
<BR>
trustworthy.  I'm afraid that may not happen until after some nano-disaster 
<BR>
makes us realize finally that we either love and live together or we don't 
<BR>
and become extinct together.

<P>Zero, if you keep thinking like that you may wind up the liberal Democratic 
<BR>
contender for the presidency in 2020!  Mike Lorrey will grind his teeth when 
<BR>
he hears you discuss 'nano control' for the sake of the public good!  You 
<BR>
will be campaigning on the promise to bring to justice the underground group 
<BR>
of plotters known as the 'Yudkowskians' who want to bring on a massive 
<BR>
singularity! lol! :)
<BR>
<P>The novel 'Aristoi' is a far-future example of this.  After the original 
<BR>
Earth was destroyed by nano they moved to carefully control the technology 
<BR>
and even then there were serpents in paradise.
<BR>
<P>When will we as a race be trustworthy, any time soon? lol  I agree with 
<BR>
Anders about the directions to go in making nano a sustainable technology 
<BR>
despite the existance of those who would subvert it for criminal goals.

<BR>
Making people saner, putting safeguards into place, having an open
<BR>
debate about issues and applying the technology for protection (such
<BR>
as active shields for nano) might not be enough, but it buys us time
<BR>
and maneouvering room.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>This will be a much bigger test for humanity then nuclear weapons or 
<BR>
computer hacking.  And yet we have largely done well with the power of the 
<BR>
atom and silicon chip which gives me hope for the future.  I think that even 
<BR>
though Anders shows us a road that has scary implications(near-anything 
<BR>
boxes in the hands of the common citizen), it is the high road and is the 
<BR>
only place we can go to maximize the benefits for all while realistically 
<BR>
minimizing the dark possibilities.
<BR>
