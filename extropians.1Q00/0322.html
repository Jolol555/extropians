<P>Interesting !!  I think your picture of the information flow from (at the

results is correct. 
<BR>
<P>But if this picture is indeed correct, then that would I think imply that the 
<BR>
discussion organizations possible in/with a mailing list are NOT suited to 
<BR>
this *complete* road of information processing including the parts of it near 
<BR>
the 'execution' stage.  I.e., attempts to nevertheless try to organize a 
<BR>
mailing-list based structure into something that covers this whole road would 
<BR>
fail -- because of incompatibility between the inherently 'linear' mailing 
<BR>
list debate structure and the 'parallel' things that have to occur in the mind 
<BR>
just before that mind decides to execute an action. 
<BR>
<P>If we want to artificially strengthen the mind's parallel processes linking 
<BR>
linear debate and action (e.g. in such a way that, instead of one individual 
<BR>
only, a *group* of people might have a 'say' in this parallel-processing 
<BR>
stage), then I think we need a structure/organization that is fundamentally 
<BR>
different and maybe incompatible with what is possible on a mailing list.  I 
<BR>
also think that we would need a more 'distributed' organization -- something 
<BR>
looking like a collection of brains between which ''thoughts'' belonging to 
<BR>
this parallel-processing phase can jump in a non-centralized way directly from 
<BR>
brain to brain.  I mean, I think that in any workable version of this 
<BR>
artificial prop-up of the mind's parallel processes we are looking for, it 
<BR>
might be inherently *impossible* to have any kind of central 'chairman' 
<BR>
managing a central 'white-board'.

<P>&gt; I was trying to focus on the specific mode where we &quot;debate&quot;, although
&gt; perhaps a better term would be &quot;argue&quot; or even &quot;fight&quot;.  The classic bad
&gt; example would be the gun control topic which took up so much time and
&gt; energy a few months ago.  Both sides in that debate were convinced that
&gt; they were good and the other side was evil, and no amount of energy was
&gt; spared in an offer-no-quarter battle.
<P>I've not directly seen this debate, but I certainly have heard a lot of 
talking about this notorious gun debate ! :-)  In other topics on other mailng 
lists, however, I have taken part in similar apparently fruitless debates. 
<P>While such debates seem not to change the minds of the majority of either of 
the contesting parties, I think that nevertheless there *is* something gained 
from these debates, namely: *some* people listening to the debate *do* learn 
more effective debating strategies from it.  Such as: when a debate keeps 
raging on for a long time without anything new emerging, then (1) it is a 
waste of your own time to contribute to it in a way that keeps the debate 
where it is and only prolongs it; and (2) therefore, the only way to 
contribute to the debate that is not a waste of your own time is to try to 
move the debate to a ''higher level'' in some way, i.e., to seek out 
generalities and to review all entrenched theories from that other, new, point 
of view.  I mean, these prolonged debates apparently leading nowhere IMO do 
force people to think more ''deeply'' than they would have done otherwise; and 
IMO do really enforce the conclusion that the (only) way forward in these 
cases is to come out of the trenches and to look at things in a broader sense. 
<P>As a further consequence, I think it follows that the people who come away 
from a battle having in some way moved on to ''higher planes of 
understanding'' are fully justified when they look on people holding fast to 
they entrenched theories (unchanged since the beginning of the debate) as a 
bit stupid and sorry; and I think that the first are fully justified in 
calling the latter to order or in making fun of them and in calling them 
childish fools.  The simple fact that the latter see that they are looked upon 
as sorry cases holding obsolete poins-of-view might help bend the latter's 
loud obstinate fruitless passion a bit into more open-minded silent 
contemplation.  Nothing that indices you more into thinking, opening up your 
mind, and listening first instead of continuing shouting around your entrenced 
preconceptions than someone convincing you of the fact that your ideas are 
obsolete, isn't it ?  The effect of this to the group or group-discussion as a 
whole (viewed from a long-term perspective) is that the group as a whole moves 
on to a higher level; and this effect is simply enforced by the 'fight' -- 
there is no central organization deciding on the outcome of the fight or on 
what's ''right'' or ''wrong''.  Survival of the points-of-view that are the 
least entrenced and the most willing to look at (and compare themselves to) 
alternatives. 
<P><P>&gt; Debate tends to be zero-sum or even negative-sum.  I feel that we can
&gt; best increase extropy by being supportive of each other rather than by
&gt; looking for battles to fight.
<P>We could also maybe increase extropy by **looking at** battles and fights in 
lights in which they appear as positive sum games.  E.g., arms races do force 
each contesting party into learning more effective strategies, not only by 
inventing new strategies themselves, but also (!) by learing from (spying on) 
*each other*.  When two parties fight (when two parties have a tough debate), 
this very fight might simply be the process by which they learn from each 
other ?
