This is something else I found surfing.....from BlackLightPower.com.
<BR>
<P>&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
A fundamental new energy source (the BlackLightSM TM process) has been 
<BR>
derived theoretically and confirmed empirically by BlackLight Power Inc. 
<BR>
(BLP). The process is not nuclear -- neither fission nor fusion, nor is it 
<BR>
chemical in the usual sense, in that there is no molecular alteration. The 
<BR>
BlackLightSM TM process, developed by Randell L. Mills, BlackLight's 
<BR>
President, is a catalytically induced transformation of hydrogen energy 
<BR>
states to levels below the &quot;ground state&quot; (n=1), as defined by generally 
<BR>
accepted atomic theory. Recent experimental data indicate energy releases 
<BR>
beyond one thousand times the combustion energy of hydrogen. Since the 
<BR>
combustion energy is the energy required to split water into hydrogen and 
<BR>
oxygen, the hydrogen fuel can be produced from water using a fraction of a 
<BR>
percent of the released energy. Thus the BlackLightSM TM process gives rise 
<BR>
to a prospective inexhaustible, economical, environmentally friendly energy 
<BR>
source.

<BR>
<P>Short Abstract
<BR>
Dr. Mills has built on the work generally known as quantum mechanics by 
<BR>
deriving a new atomic theory based on first principles. The novel theory 
<BR>
hereafter referred to as Mills' theory unifies Maxwell's Equations, Newton's 
<BR>
Laws, and Einstein's General and Special Relativity. The central feature of 
<BR>
this theory is that all particles (atomic-size and macroscopic particles) 
<BR>
obey the same physical laws. Whereas Schrödinger postulated a boundary 
<BR>
condition: as , the boundary condition in Mills' theory was derived from 
<BR>
Maxwell's equations [7]:
<BR>
<P>For non-radiative states, the current-density function must not possess 
<BR>
space-time Fourier components that are synchronous with waves traveling at 
<BR>
the speed of light.
<BR>
<P>Application of this boundary condition leads to a physical model of 
<BR>
particles, atoms, molecules, and, in the final analysis, cosmology. The 
<BR>
closed-form mathematical solutions contain fundamental constants only, and 
<BR>
the calculated values for physical quantities agree with experimental 
<BR>
observations.
<BR>
<P>The theory successfully predicts many measured quantities of atomic physics 
<BR>
and spectroscopy, the nature of the chemical bond, masses of fundamental 
<BR>
particles, nuclear physics, cosmology, and a wide variety of astrophysical 
<BR>
observations. It provides a resolution of the 8 solar problems. Over 60 
<BR>
spectral lines from the interstellar medium, the Sun, flares, protostars, and 
<BR>
the microwave infrared background match those predicted for the existence of 
<BR>
lower-energy hydrogen corresponding to fractional quantum numbers. Mills' 
<BR>
theory is derived from first principles and holds over a scale of spacetime 
<BR>
of 45 orders of magnitude: it correctly predicts the nature of the universe 
<BR>
from the scale of the quarks to that of the cosmos.

book might be worth reading?
