<EM>&gt;   PCP's effect, that's a most-relevant category.

.....
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    Since both drugs are SSRI's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that alter behavior via increasing serotonin, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   since hallucinations are also linked to increasing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   serotonin, it's plausible to hypnotize a common basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, PCP's primary effect is to act as a noncompetetive inhibitor
<BR>
at NMDA receptors, which themselves have nothing to do with the 5-HT
<BR>
pathway. They act as an antagonist for these receptors, which respond to the
<BR>
NT's Glutamate and Glycine only (Ketamine and dextromethorphan have the same
<BR>
action). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not this antagonist has anything to do with
<BR>
increasing/decreasing serotonin levels is beyond me, but to say that the
<BR>
drugs &quot;do similar things&quot; would be untrue, since Prozac is directly involved
<BR>
in the 5-HT pathway, blocking the reuptake of serotonin (thus an SSRI), and
<BR>
PCP isn't.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further evidence is found in the fact that PCP induced psychosis cannot
<BR>
be treated with antipsychotics, which might sometimes lead to fatal
<BR>
tachycardia, but can be treated with benzodiazapenes (Valium), which acts on
<BR>
the amino acid neurotransmitter systems (which is what Glutamate and Glycine
<BR>
are). Cheers,
