<BR>
<P>Um, no.  I have Seasonal Affected Depression.  This may explain
<BR>
the nature of my posts in the past couple weeks.  What a thing to
<BR>
enter into the electronic public record for all eternity, eh?   This
<BR>
particular episode was more severe than most but mercifully short.
<BR>
But the sun came out today.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I started a thread, coincidentally last winter, suggesting an
<BR>
advantage to a population of the individuals within it suffering from
<BR>
depression, which would seem like a reproductive disadvantage to
<BR>
the sufferer.  I have with a couple of new ideas.
<BR>
<P>When one is depressed, one takes apart ones internal software,
<BR>
examines every piece.  The deepest introspection occurs during these
<BR>
periods, and perhaps no other time.  My most creative periods are
<BR>
in these dark times.  It is easy to imagine that the inventions that
<BR>
were
<BR>
the key earliest ones in mankind's development were derived by
<BR>
a sufferer of depression, thereby giving a survival advantage
<BR>
to his clan.  I am told it does not work this way, but it sure makes
<BR>
sense to me that it should.
<BR>
<P>Can we not imagine a cold hungry shivering group huddled in
<BR>
a cave, where one severely introspective member suddenly
<BR>
visualizes a stone chimney, with hoarded wood burning therein;
<BR>
with stored grain and domestic animals providing nutrition
<BR>
throughout the long cold dark months, obviating the dangerous
<BR>
winter hunt?  Why not?
<BR>
<P>My best ideas come from these yearly introspective times.   This
<BR>
month I dreamed up a new mathematical proof  involving
<BR>
Mersenne primes.   I wrote a song.  My extropian posts, while
<BR>
not works of brilliance, were a bit out of the ordinary.  On the other
<BR>
hand I wept over a silly television show  (Thursday's ER, where they
<BR>
killed Lucy Knight).  This is what I did that night instead of the
<BR>
monthly nanoschmooze with Chris Peterson and Eric Drexler, which
<BR>
I missed because I was practically paralysed with grief which
<BR>
came from nowhere, even before the show.  I missed my
<BR>
grandfather.  Hmmm, another one of those wonderful little items to
<BR>
enter forever into the unforgetting internet.
<BR>
<P>Normally I avoid making decisions during these periods;
<BR>
this time I made two.  I bought a bicycle and quit my job.
<BR>
Fortunately, I have a good reputation as a problem solver,
<BR>
and had another better job the same day.  And I like the bike.
<BR>
<P>There are medications available to prevent these yearly episodes,
<BR>
but I do not really want to prevent them.  This is what make me
<BR>
who I am.  They normally last only a couple weeks, and sometimes
<BR>
leave me with ideas that carry me through the year.  They provide
<BR>
me with contrast, for if I have not sorrow, how can I know that I am
<BR>
happy the rest of the time?
<BR>
<P>Motivations:  summer is comfortable.  Comfortable people do
<BR>
not accomplish much, do not question, are not interesting in
<BR>
changing anything.  Why should they?  What is the motive, if one is
<BR>
comfortable and happy?  But it sharpens ones perceptions when
<BR>
ones back is against the wall.  The sun came out today.  spike
