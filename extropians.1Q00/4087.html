<EM>&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:GBurch1@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Clinton's%20National%20Nanotechnology%20Initiative&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000304174749.38279.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">GBurch1@aol.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These observations are consistent with my own.  Although the word 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;visionary&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gets bandied about from time to time by historians and even contemporary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political spin-doctors, the political process is pretty ruthless in weeding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out imagination.  In fact, the almost-universal career pattern for both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elected politicians and government bureaucrats selects very heavily for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conventional thinking.  Since success in these fields is almost entirely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;function of being allowed access to existing power structures by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incumbents,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any sign of non-conformity is suppressed at a very early stage.   By the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone has achieved a position of real power and influence, they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;learned well the lesson that only small, incremental change is &quot;possible&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the &quot;problem&quot; with our system of checks and balances.  No one person 
<BR>
ever has enough &quot;real power&quot; to effect change without building a critical 
<BR>
mass consensus among other similarly limited power brokers.  Don't get me 
<BR>
wrong, I whole-heartedly believe our checks and balances are a *good* thing. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't trust any politician enough to give them monarchy power.  But the 
<BR>
fact is that real change, even positive change, is laboriously 
<BR>
slow--especially when it comes to such little-understood subjects as 
<BR>
ultra-high technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;People who succeed in the political world over the span of a typical career
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have almost always internalized the pattern of suspicion of innovation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;On top of this is the fact that the democratic process makes maintaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power a full-time job.  People in positions of power in most institutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't have the time or energy to really study new ideas.  They depend on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;summaries and sound-bite outlines for &quot;mastery&quot; of even the most complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policy issues, with most of their personal resources being devoted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constantly &quot;working the system&quot; to stay in power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These factors make looking to the political process for leadership in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanist agenda essentially hopeless.  As a result, I've come to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conclude that successful strategies for truly rapid progress toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanist goals must look to means for cleverly side-stepping the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power structure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, as Drexler suggests in his writings, once the tech is sufficiently 
<BR>
close to achievement, public policy will have no choice but to deal with it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to nanotech, again as Drexler postulates, there is no 
<BR>
practical means of bringing that ball to a stop once it starts rolling.  So 
<BR>
the only policy question will be how to pursue the tech in the safest 
<BR>
possible manner.  So essentially, all we need to do to effect such change is 
<BR>
to continue to pursue the science and technology needed to make our goals 
<BR>
reality.
<BR>
<P>That's why I was personally so thrilled with the NNI announcement.  Not that 
<BR>
the few hundred mil it entails is going to get the job done, but because it 
<BR>
is the first step in putting nanotech on the global socio-political radar 
<BR>
screen.  The US now has an official national initiative.  As a result, 
<BR>
Europe and Japan will almost certainly increase their efforts, which will in 
<BR>
turn spur the US to further increase its own efforts.  I foresee an imminent 
<BR>
nanotech-race similar to the cold war nuclear arms race.  This could mean 
<BR>
some scary moments if some not-so-friendly nation makes the major 
<BR>
breakthroughs first.  But I believe Japan and the US have what is pretty 
<BR>
close to an insurmountable head start, so I'm not too worried.  I think the 
<BR>
coming nanotech race will be a good thing.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen, start your nanolabs!&quot;
<BR>
<P>-Zero
