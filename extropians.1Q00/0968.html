On Tue, 18 Jan 2000, David Crookes, commenting on my graphs wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What are the Y axis variables.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on how I put them together, but generally X is &quot;year&quot;
<BR>
and Y is scale of micro/nano-assembly, Instructions/CPU, memory
<BR>
density, etc.  The really interesting ones are growth in wealth
<BR>
or matter manipulation capacity where you go off the scale in days.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I presume you have CPU &amp; memory storage graphs but I'd be interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in seeing what else.
</EM><BR>
<P>The really interesting ones are self-assembling self-replication
<BR>
times.  *Fundamental Question*:  Assuming you have the feedstock,
<BR>
what are the limits to &quot;physical growth&quot;.  You think that question
<BR>
would have been answered by science now.  Not to my knowledge.
<BR>
Eric does a lot of hand waving between the replication time
<BR>
for a nanoassembler and the replication time of a 1kg assembler 
<BR>
system in Nanosystems.  One of the recent papers by Josh seems
<BR>
to hint that Eric is rather conservative.  Other comments by
<BR>
Robert Freitas seem to lead me to that conclusion as well.
<BR>
<P>For a real world example -- ask yourself this -- If you have
<BR>
three &quot;molecules&quot; and a genetic program for them, i.e. the DNA for
<BR>
the genes of RNA and DNA polymerases and the ribosome subcomponents
<BR>
and one of each of those&quot;machines&quot; to implement the cycle:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA -&gt; RNA; RNA -&gt; Protein; Protein makes more DNA &amp; RNA
<BR>
how fast can that system double itself (given unlimited energy
<BR>
and material resources)?  I haven't worked it out yet, but my
<BR>
brief investigation into the limiting factors (rates of transcription)
<BR>
suggests that it doubles in very short periods (probably minutes).
<BR>
And this is for a system that nature did not design to be highly
<BR>
optimized for &quot;reproduction&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would you be willing to post them?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do intend to get around to organizing and HTMLizing some of my
<BR>
work sometime this year.   Of course I'll let the list know.
<BR>
If you don't see it in a few months, lean on me a bit, I tend to be
<BR>
demand driven.
<BR>
<P>Robert
