</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following?':
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong, wrong!!  I deny it, it wasn't me!!  It was...it was...it was, um...  
<BR>
Oh!  It was Mike Lorrey, yeah that's it!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Not really.  In fact this sort of power-proportional transparency is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in effect in some ways.  Right now we can know much more about President
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Clinton than he could ever know about you.  I know where and when he 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;travels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; abroad.  I know why he has gone there and whom he talked to and what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; talked about.  If I wanted to I could, in a matter of minutes, find out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his agenda is for next week, where he'll be and what he'll be doing.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact its probably fair to say that Clinton is the *most* surveilled 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the planet, as it should be.  And he has been kept alive by his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; detail for a little more than 5 minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, but there's a hell of a lot you DON'T know about Clinton, especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrt his top military generals, the FBI, and the CIA.  For comparison, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bet you don't know a damn thing about what the men at the head of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations are talking about on a day-to-day basis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is certainly as it should be, as it's hard to imagine these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations doing their jobs effectively without this sort of secrecy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power proportional 
<BR>
transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely 
<BR>
replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the little 
<BR>
guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the little 
<BR>
guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just 
<BR>
pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;formation of other corporate structures as well...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rights?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You seem to have missed the antecedent &quot;if national sovreignity ends or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanes...&quot; Nobody would claim that this is the case today.  National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sovreignity is alive and well, for better or worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps you came in late in the thread, but Mike Lorrey was replying to my 
<BR>
proposal that once a democratic &quot;Global&quot; government was in place there would 
<BR>
be no need for such things as &quot;national&quot; security.  I never proposed that 
<BR>
*all* government disappear.  I don't want to (nor expect that I ever will) 
<BR>
live in a global anarchy.  I presume that there will *always* be rules and a 
<BR>
means by which to ensure that they are complied with.  A global government 
<BR>
would be no less a government than a national government.  And as long as 
<BR>
there is government, and as long as antitrust rules are deemed beneficial to 
<BR>
society, there will be antitrust rules and the means by which to enforce 
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;allowed to become law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Examples, please.  Even if that is the case, that is not what *I* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (at least not yet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a problem of entailment of consequences.  You find it in policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debate more than anywhere else, IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alice:  We should not abide by your proposal that X, because Y will follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from it.  (where Y is something nasty)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bob:  But I'm not proposing that Y.  I'm proposing that X.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Clearly, Bob's making a kind of mistake here.  Assuming that X does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*indeed* lead to Y, you CAN'T just propose X without proposing that X &amp; Y.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well here's how it would really go:
<BR>
Michael:  We should not abide by your proposal for reasonable gun control, 
<BR>
because universal disarmament will follow from it.
<BR>
Zero:  But I'm not proposing universal disarmament.  I'm proposing 
<BR>
reasonable gun control.  Because (a) I don't believe that one necessarily 
<BR>
follows the other and (b) although universal disarmament may be a bad thing 
<BR>
now, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be bad in the future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Once again, not really.  It doesn't take much computing power at all to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; browse an efficiently designed and frequently updated database.  Each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; citizen would not have to bear the onerous burden of creating and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maintaining their own database.  The database would be publicly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maintained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (of course under the glare of a great deal of transparency).  When I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the info, I'd just cruise on over to the database, log in and have a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around.  Not much different than what happens now when you go to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;google.com.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I would not have much advantage using a 1ghz Pentium III over somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using a 66mhz 486 in browsing such a database.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think your picture of this surveilance is naive in an important way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;---
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Suppose that all of the people who have the potential to do me some wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are fully under surveilance, accessible to me.  (The converse need not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;true for this example to work.)  In front of me now is a large sampling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of, presumedly, video and audio data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, assumedly, not EVERYONE is doing wrongs or planning to do so right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now.  Indeed, by and large, MOST of these people aren't doing anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nasty at all.  Yet it would be *really* naive to think that NONE of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are.  So I need to find them.  I don't know where they live, I don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their names, I don't even have a very clear picture as to what wrongdoing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would look like, (murder? theft? conspiracy? money laundering? these all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look very different from the eye of a camera,) but, be that as it may, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this surveilance equipment is to do me any good, I need to find out who's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing wrong or planning to do so, ideally as it happens.  (If you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like my use of the word &quot;wrong&quot; throughout, you may replace it with &quot;harm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to me&quot; without much loss of meaning.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, you might not think of this problem as a computational project
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;straightaway, unless you take into account the general heuristic that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything a human can identify, a sufficiently complicated computer program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can also identify.  Just as computers can be taught to read books and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;analyze pieces of music, computers can also be taught to identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrongdoing in as nuanced a manner as a human can.  We are a long way off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from this point, obviously, but the principle seems sound.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alternately, if that strong principle didn't appeal to you, then allow me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to assume that your brain, for my purposes, is a computer.  If you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like me using that word wrt your brain, then let the claim be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;metaphorical.  Clearly, YOUR BRAIN could identify all the wrongdoing being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done out there right now, simply by looking at the raw footage coming off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the cameras and through the microphones, if it was very fast.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alternately, a whole vast army of brain-computers could do the same job.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The various data go in, you think about it, and the results (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;identification of wrongdoing as it happens) come out.  Even if your brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isn't (just?) a computer, it's sufficiently computer-like that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;analogy seems to be capturing some relevant similarity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you bought either of my two lines of argument, you'll see that turning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the raw data into a report of where wrongdoing is taking place is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;massive computational project.  It would either require a massively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful computer or a whole lot of thinkers with time on their hands to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do it.  As you can probably see, a 486 will be nowhere near the task, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even would a 1 TERAHERTZ (one thousand gigahertz) processor be up to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;task of analyzing all of this footage.  Not to mention the fact that it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather dull work most of the time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here, if I know your type, you'll interject &quot;Ah ha!  I just happen to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exactly that, a vast army of people, all keeping their eyes on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras!  It's us, the entire human race, *watching ourselves*.&quot;  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;notice: How many hours per day, on average, do you suppose people will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;watching those cameras?  3 hours a day?  4?  5?  Let's make it 6 just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be generous.  This is almost as much as the average person watches TV,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only these cameras are much MUCH less exciting.  On account of this, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maximum, a quarter of the data is getting analyzed for wrongdoing daily.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To compound this problem, there's no reason to think that all of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people will be keeping their eyes on different cameras, so much of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data (especially the celebrities) will be analyzed twice.  So at MOST a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quarter of the data will be analyzed, but if it turns out to be even half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that, I'd be surprised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not looking quite as much like total surveilance anymore, is it?  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course, I could fix this, at least wrt myself, by buying &quot;computing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power/time, either by building and using the right sort of computer or by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hiring others to look at the cameras that I pay them to look at and to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;report wrongdoings to me. So right away we see significant differences in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;YOUR capacity to identify wrongdoing relative to MY capacity to identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrongdoing.  I'm getting much, much more use out of the system than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are, because I'm more powerful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;---
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There's a reductio at the end of this tunnel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now suppose that surveilance is ubiquitous, but a select group of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know where all of the 'wrongdoing' directed towards them is, thanks to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact that they have more powerful computers.  Suppose as well that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone knows this.  Suppose as well that this select group of people is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very powerful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're a little guy compared to them.  They come to you and make some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outrageous demands, adding that it is pointless to try to resist them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either alone or in a group, because they'll know if you do, and, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being very powerful, will squash you like a bug if you try.  You know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are right, because you have surveilance equipment pointed at them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How has total surveilance helped you in this case?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You might be inclined to argue that while ubiquitous surveilance might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help keep a despot in power, it will also help prevent a despot from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rising to power in the first place.  But this isn't the case either,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thanks to the fact that differences in computing power will ALWAYS make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ubiquitous surveilance equipment more useful to someone with more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computing power than it is to someone with less.  So ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveilance equipment benefits the powerful more than it benefits the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weak.  It might help somewhat in the mythical state of nature, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all people are supposed to be equally powerful relative to everybody else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In this state, we imagine, only a tyranny of the majority could form.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even this mythical state wouldn't last, since to whatever extent someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;became more powerful than someone else, this power relative to others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be magnified by the ubiquitous surveilance equipment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So ubiquitous surveilance promotes despotism; since despotism is nasty, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the extent that we can prevent ubiquitous surveilance, we should.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, you must have come into the thread late.  You seem to completely 
<BR>
misunderstand (a) what I am proposing and (b) why I think it would be a good 
<BR>
idea.  I am not necessarily proposing omniscience for the masses.  I 
<BR>
advocate &quot;transparency.&quot;  There is a difference.  In particular I advocate 
<BR>
power proportional transparency which means that the more power you have to 
<BR>
effect the lives of others the more exposed you must be.  Such that if you 
<BR>
are the designated leader of the free world, you will live under a virtual 
<BR>
microscope with nearly everything about you being recorded and available for 
<BR>
perusal by those whose lives you have the power to effect.
<BR>
<P>I also propose that the transparency be mutual and two-way, such that 
<BR>
anytime I access any information about you, you can automatically be 
<BR>
notified of (a) what information I got about you, (b) when I got it, (c) how 
<BR>
I got it, (d) who I am, and (e) whatever information I got about you, you 
<BR>
could be given about me.  For instance say I looked up Dan Fabulich's home 
<BR>
address and telephone number.  You would be notified that I did that and you 
<BR>
would, if you wanted, be notified of my home address and telephone number.  
<BR>
You could also be notified of where, when and how I make use of your 
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P>None of this would necessitate you searching a huge database, or having a 
<BR>
very powerful computer.  It would be the equivolent of receiving an e-mail 
<BR>
or an automated telephone call.  Now if for whatever reason you were the 
<BR>
sort that got his jollies by compiling huge amounts of data on a large 
<BR>
portion of the population and conducting all sorts of analysis on it, then 
<BR>
perhaps you would need a fairly fast computer.  However, given the fact that 
<BR>
the technology needed to fully implement my proposals is probably *decades* 
<BR>
down the road, by the time you needed to do that sort of research I'm fairly 
<BR>
certain you'll be able to afford all the computing power you need to do it.
<BR>
<P>Although keeping in mind that for everytime you *get* information about 
<BR>
someone else you also have to *give* that same information about yourself, I 
<BR>
don't know how anxious you would be to be doing research on 90% of the 
<BR>
population.  That could very well make you a *very* popular guy :)
