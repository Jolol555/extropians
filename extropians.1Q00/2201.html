<P><EM>     &gt;Just copy &quot;uploaded&quot; minds selected  for Jury duty.  Have the trial.

<EM>     &gt;When situations arise where things need to be &quot;ignored&quot;, you just do
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;a &quot;rollback&quot; [...]  the problem is that normal humans don't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;delete key.  We can fix that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm dubious of the conventional wisdom that ignorance is the key to
<BR>
&nbsp;justice, but your suggestion has other problems. Maybe it's just me but if
<BR>
I was one of those uploads I would object strenuously to having part of my
<BR>
memory erased, so strenuously that I would be willing to kill in order to ovoid
<BR>
jury duty. And it would lead to a population explosion of uploads too, when
<BR>
the trial is over I'll be damned if I'll let you turn me off.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Now, of course one gets into the question of what would make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&quot;ideal&quot; eJury.
</EM><BR>
<P>The best jury is no jury and no judge either, better to have an arbitrator.
<BR>
If the arbitrator receives no salary but is paid by the case, and if he's
<BR>
picked by both sides then it's in his financial interest to be as just as
<BR>
possible. If he favored one side over another, or made brutal or stupid
<BR>
decisions he would not be picked again and would need to look for a
<BR>
new line of work. Unlike present day judges and juries, justice would
<BR>
have a net positive survival value for the arbitrator. Justice is no different
<BR>
than anything else, if you want to maximize something make it a
<BR>
commodity and sell it on the open market.
