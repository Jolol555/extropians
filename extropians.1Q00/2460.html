What is really interesting to think of is not body modifications but
<BR>
mental modifications. They could really bring about clonliness - or
<BR>
make people so wildly individual that the social scene would start to
<BR>
look like a sitcom (hmm... it already does, from my vantage point :-).- --
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Mental modifications could turn out to be ultimately the most jarring to 
<BR>
others.  Remember in Star Trek episodes where McCoy and others are bothered 
<BR>
by Spock's vulcan emotional control?  I could see similar situations when 
<BR>
some people decide to maintain a strict control over their emotions to block 
<BR>
out possible pain or for added focus in their life.  Others might move their 
<BR>
emotional range in the opposite direction.
<BR>
<P>What could be very disturbing is when people decide to &quot;turn off&quot; their 
<BR>
conscience to do ethically malicious things.  Of course drugs and alcohol 
<BR>
have been used for centuries in this way.  Not just by individuals but also 
<BR>
governments and militaries.
