<P>I can't argue your point, Zero, on a purely pragmatic basis.
<BR>
What you say is true.
<BR>
<P>But I am inclined to hedge here a bit -- what we are talking
<BR>
about are &quot;religious&quot; belief systems, and I am not aware that
<BR>
in any sacred scriptures in the world there is an unambiguous
<BR>
moral command to destroy human life.
<BR>
<P>Not that these metaphorical documents are not capable of
<BR>
infinite interpretation -- certainly the Torah was the basis
<BR>
of the attempted genocide of the Philistines by the Hebrews.
<BR>
But this was war, and in a war politicians, generals and the
<BR>
rest invariably try to legitimize the use of lethal force by
<BR>
citing some passage in something that seems to provide
<BR>
&quot;religious&quot; justification, i.e. to prove killing is the right thing
<BR>
to do in this case. There is no scriptural basis of any kind
<BR>
that states unequivocally that Christians should  bomb
<BR>
abortion clinics.  In my view, this is mere rationalization by
<BR>
sociopaths to justify what they would probably do anyway
<BR>
in another connection if they could feel righteous about it.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this distinction has no practical meaning at all, but
<BR>
for me at least it is quite important spiritually.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your reply,
<BR>
