As Anders requested I sent off his story to a list who could be considered 
<BR>
transhumanist 'racialists.' lol  These were their reactions.  By the way, 
<BR>
what is a 'jävla tönt'?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,

Subject: A story...
<BR>
<P><P>It's definitely made up by some European.
<BR>
In the US people are too confused to see racism in such simplistic light.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I thought you would all enjoy this story written by my friend Anders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sandberg who is a transhumanist and also a researcher in the field of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neurology in Sweden. I told him about this list and he asked that I send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.

<EM>&gt;Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hey Griggy! Long time no arrogant whine! ;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it's nice to see anders et al. have an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;positive view of the future, seeing as how we're
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de-evolving into a less capable species due to righteous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anti-eugenicists such as yourself, it's good to know
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you dont have any problem with your complicity in it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRASH-humanists, striving together for a coercive utopia...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, swedes, espc. those not out of their &quot;equiv&quot; of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graduate school, are not really know for their 'science'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'cocktail viruses' really, you should write for Star Trek.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he COULD be an expert, as you say, with an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awful publishing record. Most neurology experts have enough
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge not to pander antisense oligonucleotide virus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gene therapy (in the embryo!!) to anyone but true deludes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as yourself. Not their field, not yours either.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, you'll 'win' in the end, I only wish you could
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be around to see it. Trash-humanism.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be well,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delude

<P>In Sweden, to the middle and the upper classes, race
<BR>
issues are still on an academic level. I'd like to
<BR>
check back on this person in a few years just to see
<BR>
how he changed his mind. Tell yout friend he's a jävla
<BR>
tönt.
