<BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact we could put them all in pile

<EM>&gt;and the two individuals would still be there, feeling.

<EM>&gt;But every linear combination of the two sets would also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be an individual, since it's not possible to say which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neurochip belongs to what.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this thought experiment is very damaging to the matieralist
<BR>
theories of consciousness. Here's why.
<BR>
<P>Let's apply this to a computer:
<BR>
<P>Design a computer with smart memory and smart registers. Like your
<BR>
neurochips, they record their own history. After multiple runs of this
<BR>
computer, we now have multiple histories.
<BR>
<P>As you said, playing back these histories results in something that looks an
<BR>
awful lot like a computation.
<BR>
<P>Not only that, we can do, as you suggest, and throw the histories in a pile,
<BR>
and we can't tell which particular run any particular history of an
<BR>
individual memory address came from.
<BR>
<P>Here's the problem.
<BR>
<P>While it IS true that we can assemble any given linear combination of
<BR>
histories into a record, the vast majority of the records will bear no
<BR>
resemblence whatsoever to a computation. They will just be a picture of a
<BR>
random electronic spasm. We don't even have to solve the philosophic problem
<BR>
of &quot;what is the difference between a computation and a record of a
<BR>
computation&quot;, because this randomly fluctuating collection of bits is
<BR>
clearly neither. 99+% of the time, it's current state will have no
<BR>
relationship whatsoever to it's previous state. Anybody even vaguely
<BR>
familiar with the assembler language of this computer will be able to tell
<BR>
instantly that this is random noise because (for example) the program
<BR>
counter is jumping around wildly without any kind of jump instruction moving
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Richard Dawkins said &quot;Howerver many ways there are to be alive, there are
<BR>
infinitely many more ways of being dead.&quot; He was referring to the fact that
<BR>
the state space of biological organisms is infinitesimally tiny compared to
<BR>
the state space of matter. There are many fewer living organisms with n
<BR>
atoms then there are dead configurations of matter with n atoms.
<BR>
<P>The same is true of computation, and, assuming the matieralist viewpoint,
<BR>
consciousness. The state space of brain states with coherent memories and
<BR>
perceptions is WAY smaller then the state space of POSSIBLE brain states.
<BR>
Your current mental state, in general, has a causal relationship to your
<BR>
prior mental states (assuming of course you believe in the passage of time,
<BR>
that your senses at least SOMEWHAT adaquetely reflect an objective outside
<BR>
world, that the amazing internal consistency of your memories isn't a
<BR>
coincidence, etc, etc).
<BR>
<P>The thought experiment does not imply that the matieralist model is flawed,
<BR>
per se, but does empahsize that the matieralist model depends on time and
<BR>
causality.
<BR>
<P>My current brain state seems to remember both causality and time functioning
<BR>
in a reasonably traditional manner, so it holds the belief that Moravec's
<BR>
uploading should still work. On the other hand, Descarte's Evil Genius could
<BR>
just be messing with me :)
