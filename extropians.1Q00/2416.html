Friends,

<P><EM>&gt;I worked on the orbit mechanics and found that if the material were in

<EM>&gt;the same orbital plane as the planet, then all you need to do is figure

<EM>&gt;out how to stop the rotation of the planet, or rather, tide lock it with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sun.  The material could be rotating in the opposite direction as
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, but I pictured the Jupiter brain as being alone in space.  Not
<BR>
revolving around a star and not rotating.  So I didn't worry about the
<BR>
cooling tubes moving relative to the eliptical orbits of the coolant rings.
<BR>
&nbsp;If this &quot;tide lock&quot; thing works to keep everything aligned, then terrific,
<BR>
but I would worry--in the case where the JB is a &quot;satellite&quot; in orbit
<BR>
around a star or other object, and possibly in a &quot;system&quot; with other
<BR>
orbiting stuff--that the elliptical orbits of the coolant would be utterly
<BR>
unmanageable due to the gravitational disturbance caused by the star and
<BR>
the other stuff.
<BR>
<P>What I did worry about, in the situation as I pictured it originally, the
<BR>
self-sufficient JB happily transiting deep space, was the possibility of
<BR>
the precession of the coolant orbits, due to the discontinuity/drop in
<BR>
gravitational force which the coolant/ring material would experience when
<BR>
it plunged below the surface (ie through the coolant passage) of the JB.
<BR>
At a radial distance less than the full radius of a spherically symmetric
<BR>
object, the gravitational force of the material which lies outside that
<BR>
radial distance--the gravitational attraction of the outer layers of the
<BR>
object, pulling from all around--balances out to zero, leaving only the
<BR>
gravitational attraction of the material which is interior to that radius,
<BR>
ie, concentrated all to one side rather than all around.  Certainly this
<BR>
would alter the shape of the orbit from a &quot;constant&quot; ellipse to a
<BR>
continuously varying ellipse in the region of the coolant passage as it
<BR>
plunged ever deeper within the JB.  The shape of the coolant tube would
<BR>
be/could be designed to accomodate this, but what seems to me more
<BR>
challenging is the &quot;precession&quot; problem.  What happens to the &quot;standard&quot;
<BR>
elliptical orbit of the material exiting the tube relative to the orbit it
<BR>
had when it went in?  Rotating the JB and its coolant tube to accomodate a
<BR>
precession (if there is one) might/should work, if there's only one tube,
<BR>
but if you have two coolant flows skewed 90 degress from one
<BR>
another,...things start to become markedly less elegant  than they seemed
<BR>
originally (crumples up sketch, tosses it in dumper, sees nobel prize
<BR>
dematerialize from mantlepiece).
<BR>
<P>The non-standard nature of this problem would probably make it quite
<BR>
interesting to someone jaded by long experience with &quot;ordinary&quot; orbital
<BR>
mechanics calculations.  One thing's for sure,  it's more than I can
<BR>
handle.  Spike?  (Amara, you should try this only if you find it pleasant
<BR>
and self-fulfilling. ;-) )
