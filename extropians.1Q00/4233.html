You won't get me in on Mr. Larouche's party, any more then you'd interest me 
<BR>
in L. Ron Hubbard's group. Count me out.

<BR>
<P>A couple of year's ago there were alot of Larouche supporters giving out 
<BR>
newsletters here in Anchorage.  I vaguely remember the papers lashing out at 
<BR>
the Federal government and the IRS.  I can see why considering that Mr. 
<BR>
Larouche spent several year's in prison on tax evasion charges.
<BR>
<P>The man lived or lives like a king with a mansion and all the luxuries.  I 
<BR>
don't know if he had the wealth before or after he had supporters donating 
<BR>
money to him.
<BR>
<P>I was enjoy some of L. Ron Hubbard's fiction.  I got a huge kick out of 
<BR>
&quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; and it was a fast read despite around a thousand pages!  
<BR>
I really look forward to the film which stars scientology member John 
<BR>
Travolta, who pushed for the film to be made.  About a decade ago, the book 
<BR>
was partially filmed but then canned.
<BR>
<P>Because of Travolta and others I developed a vague interest in scientology 
<BR>
until I read sections of a book at my local library that gave an insider's 
<BR>
view on how the organization really operated.  I was shocked.  Needless to 
<BR>
say, scientology leadership, I believe, successfully lobbied Amazon.com to 
<BR>
remove it from their inventory.  The system does seem to help some, though.  
<BR>
I wonder how?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
