<EM>&gt; We have had no public weapons industries except for the Springfield

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is getting a collectivist push is only so because only government has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monopoly on the use of massive force. Corporations don't open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your wallet at the point of a gun.
</EM><BR>
<P>This missed the point of my note. The MO of the government is to do
<BR>
the hard part by supporting in one way or another private enterprise. Now
<BR>
weapon technology was only one of many examples referred to where the
<BR>
collectivistic drive has made a fundemental difference. Anyway, government
<BR>
violence, at least in recent time, receives its mandate from the population.
<BR>
Initially,
<BR>
the American population support the Viet Nam war, once the government effort
<BR>
lost popular support it was forced to change its tactics then eventually
<BR>
withdraw.

<EM>&gt; &gt; What history says to me that individualistic or collectivistic societies
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; philosophies are premised on distorted perspectives of who and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; human beings are. We are both social (collective) and individual so our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; societies need to reflect a similar balance which is no mean trick and
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; always successful, but it is none the less the most correct approch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who is social?
</EM><BR>
<P>All of us are social by our nature. We would not be human if we had no
<BR>
interaction
<BR>
with others since it is others who teach us to be human. This, of course, is
<BR>
not addressing
<BR>
personal traits of being gregarious, solitary, or anything in between. If
<BR>
you are not
<BR>
living alone in a cave you exist in and are part of the collective
<BR>
experience. Sorry.
