<P>
Eliezer Yudkowsky did say:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The reason I disagree with this theory is that it's static.  Alice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already has the Apples and Bob already has the Bananas.  The theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't talk about production, or about where the Apples and Bananas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come from.  The static analysis presents a clear &quot;potential energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface&quot; in which a set of local quantitative valuations is enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easily compute the space of beneficial global transactions, and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likewise easy to navigate to a point in that space using a set of global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantitative valuations determined by supply and demand.  There's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point in complex analysis because the utility of Apples or Bananas is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply the joy experienced by the person consuming that Apple or Banana,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and there's no functional difference between valuing that joy in Cattle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or valuing it in Diamonds.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The utility of trade is *specialization*.  A smith can produce iron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons more cheaply than a hunter, and an experienced hunter can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce meat more cheaply than a smith.
</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to be arguing two points at once:
<BR>
<P>First, you're arguing against the &quot;static&quot; analysis which I used when I
<BR>
presented my argument as to why trade is good, arguing that it fails when
<BR>
it faces a dynamic situation.  But, of course, in my example, there
<BR>
*aren't* any dynamic effects.  In my example, Alice wants Bananas today
<BR>
just as much as she wanted them yesterday, and just as much as she will
<BR>
want them tomorrow.  The fact that I didn't have changes over time in my
<BR>
example doesn't mean that I can't take them into account, and doesn't
<BR>
imply anything at all about *how* I'd take them into account.  
<BR>
Specialization is good, it's true, but I can show that in the standard
<BR>
analysis with a single currency just as easily as you can with a complex
<BR>
barter analysis. (This is sufficiently trivial that I won't bother unless
<BR>
you ask.)
<BR>
<P>Second, you're arguing against the &quot;utility&quot; model of economic efficiency,
<BR>
which has some problems, but not the ones you're raising.  You seem to
<BR>
think that, for some reason or other, the utility model can't take into
<BR>
account the &quot;physical interaction&quot; of the goods in question.  This is just
<BR>
false.  The physical interaction is and can be taken into account through
<BR>
a utility-wise calculation, by specifying, as you suggest, the value of a
<BR>
Banana to me today and tomorrow (or the value to me of a certain bundle of
<BR>
goods, as in the case of shoes, where a right shoe is almost no good
<BR>
without the matching left shoe).  So it's not obvious where your objection
<BR>
lies with regards to utility calculations.  If your objection holds, it's
<BR>
supposed to yield wrong answers somewhere, but you haven't shown where.
<BR>
<P>Here's your first attempt:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The way that a single-currency system handles the dynamic problem is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talk about interest rates; the utility of the Banana to Alice is 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apples now, or 5 Apples in one year.  But that assumes that Alice and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bob have already computed the barter; the currency valuation simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labels it, *it doesn't produce the transaction*.  If Alice and Bob are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Marketplace, trying to buy things with Diamonds, they might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starve to death where a complex-barter system would keep them alive.
</EM><BR>
<P>This example doesn't show what you're arguing.  Remember, the
<BR>
single-currency is one of the goods being traded on the market.  Let it be
<BR>
Bananas.  In a static situation, if Alice and Bob declare the number of
<BR>
Bananas they're willing to trade for an Apple, they've just declared all
<BR>
the information they need.  If you're with me there, then notice that
<BR>
Alice also has enough information to declare the number of Bananas she'll
<BR>
accept today in trade for Apples tomorrow (or next year, or whatever your
<BR>
time scale is), namely, she'll trade as many as 5 Apples tomorrow for 3
<BR>
Bananas today.  With that declaration, of course, Alice and Bob are ready
<BR>
to make a deal.  As expected, simply by declaring what they know in terms
<BR>
of a standard good, the deal happens.
<BR>
<P>Of course, when there's only two goods, there's no difference between
<BR>
barter and single-currency, so the point here is moot.
<BR>
<P>You make a second attempt to give faulty results under the standard
<BR>
analysis, but qualify it by saying:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And yes, in this particular scenario, you can always ask why they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sell their existing Apples or Bananas at the reduced price and use them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to buy Bananas or Apples from Eric or Drexler.  But that's just an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artifact of the way this particular scenario happens to work.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem, in essence, is that Alice, Bob, and Carol's Carrots have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priced out of the Marketplace.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, this isn't an artifact of the scenario at all.  It's just an
<BR>
instance of Ricardo's &quot;comparative advantage&quot; theory.  It will hold no
<BR>
matter HOW you figure the numbers.  An interesting fact about this theory
<BR>
is that there's no way to get &quot;priced out of the Marketplace,&quot; since
<BR>
you'll always get some advantage from specialization and trading with the
<BR>
market.  The main factors that get in its way are transaction costs and
<BR>
starvation-like problems: in some cases, even the added advantage of trade
<BR>
isn't sufficient to sustain life.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, complex barter doesn't solve starvation in any meaningful
<BR>
way, nor does it make trades possible which are impossible on the Diamond
<BR>
system you describe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, none of this deals with the *real* advantage of complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barter:  Complex barter futures, which protect virtuous cycles from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pricing shocks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now we get to the real issue.  Price shocks.  Yes, I discussed the issue
<BR>
of local price stability briefly at the end of my long post on barter.  
<BR>
There I pointed out that, of course, we *do* want more than one currency
<BR>
so as to be able to sustain instability in one currency without affecting
<BR>
the rest of the economy.  In a multi-currency system, like ours, the
<BR>
currencies are traded via complex barter.  An entire economy run on
<BR>
complex barter would be the extreme case where *all* of the goods would be
<BR>
treated as currencies; this economy would have maximal price stability in
<BR>
this domain.
<BR>
<P>I argued in my last post that the computational cost of adding new
<BR>
&quot;currencies&quot; (that is, of treating more and more goods via complex barter,
<BR>
and determining the value of the rest of the goods on the market in terms
<BR>
of all of those currencies,) is on the order of n^2, while the added
<BR>
stability diminishes as the number of currencies increases.  So imagine
<BR>
two curves which intercept the y-axis at 0: one, the stability advantage
<BR>
curve, concave down and starting off with a large initial slope,
<BR>
eventually reaching a horizontal asymptote, and another, the computational
<BR>
cost curve, concave up and starting off with a small initial slope.  On
<BR>
the y-axis is cost/advantage.  On the x-axis is the number of currencies.  
<BR>
The point where these curves intersect determines the efficient number of
<BR>
currencies.  (Draw this.  No, really.  It'll take two seconds.)  Let &quot;x&quot;
<BR>
be the efficient number of currencies.
<BR>
<P>A pure complex barter system (where all goods are traded via complex
<BR>
barter) is only efficient when x is larger than the number of goods on the
<BR>
market, though we might consider an economy to be largely organized by
<BR>
complex barter if x is somewhere on the order of the number of goods on
<BR>
the market.  Right now, with computational &amp; info-transfer costs as they
<BR>
are, this number is probably no greater than a few dozens worldwide, (I'm
<BR>
guessing, but if I'm off by an order of magnitude, I'll be Really
<BR>
Surprised,) whereas the number of goods on the market is a hell of a lot
<BR>
larger than that.
<BR>
<P>So, you're right, there are stability advantages to complex barter.  
<BR>
However, by the time computational costs get *that* cheap, I'm expecting a
<BR>
Singularity of some form or another.
