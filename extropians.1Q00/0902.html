<P>
John offers some interesting integration of the nanotech threads
<BR>
worthy of some comment ---
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but then you have to hand off to Greg and ask how much of his
<BR>
business would still exist if we had ubiquitous recording of negotions,
<BR>
people who really *knew* what they were saying and &quot;trustable&quot; entities
<BR>
(people or corporations).  The question becomes whether the advancement
<BR>
in materials processing spills over in some way into human interactions.
<BR>
Hint: watch the development of automated eBusiness closely.  If they
<BR>
make that work there is hope, if it falls on its face we are probably
<BR>
doomed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question is will governments allow their people access to such powerful 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A.I. and the nanotech replicators we all want?
</EM><BR>
<P>To ask that question, you also have to ask the inverse -- can governments
<BR>
deny access to people who really want to &quot;build&quot; them?  I've addressed
<BR>
that in my recent comments to Damien.  To my mind the answer is, &quot;I don't
<BR>
think so&quot;, though there may be a time delay in general access.  One would
<BR>
hope that &quot;common sense&quot; (generally) prevails and people don't want to
<BR>
use assemblers for unverified designs (just like most people don't yell
<BR>
&quot;fire&quot; in theatres).  For the people who want to, you have to hope
<BR>
that the desires and safeguards of those on the leading edge provide
<BR>
adequate defenses and countermeasures.  As I've said before -- &quot;grey goo&quot;
<BR>
is *very* dubious.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I said in a previous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post, I see powerful reasons for governments to wish to restrain access to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the common people.  This could be a huge civil liberties question of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next century.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, but if you are watching the encryption technology debates, it looks
<BR>
like the goverment is going to have to sacrifice security to free speach.
<BR>
Now, if someone goes back and attacks the old atomic-weapons knowledge
<BR>
with the same argument and wins, then it is clear that the the people
<BR>
(and constitution) are driving us forward.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There would have to be powerful safeguards or a twisted individual or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group could cause mass carnage before being stopped.  I wonder how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open-ended the software and hardware would be?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you assume in your premise that it is *easy* to create &quot;grey goo&quot;
<BR>
(like it is &quot;easy&quot; to create plagues).  No sensible person would create
<BR>
grey goo or plagues that they cannot control and therein lies the hard
<BR>
part.  I've discussed this before -- show me a plausible situation
<BR>
for developing a weapon of mass destruction via biotech or nanotech
<BR>
against which reasonable defenses cannot be rapidly fielded (assuming
<BR>
relatively equivalent technology capabilites).  Nobody has demonstrated
<BR>
that capacity to me yet.
<BR>
<P>Yes, sure there are anthrax bombs, but we *know* how to protect
<BR>
ourselves against them and could ensure some subset of the population
<BR>
survives.  Lord help the person who unleashed the terror.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Salespeople would sell designs and the reputation of their corporation.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, elegance and reliability will be strong sales tools.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Advertising would be more important then ever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In Robert's post I was impressed to learn that these horribly expensive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chip-making plants could be used for other then their original goal.  I had 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read articles painting a very bleak picture with no bright side to it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its lack of imagination on the part of writers and corporate CEO's wanting
<BR>
to justify huge expenses to shareholders without going out on a limb
<BR>
of predicting alternate uses or residual values.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Bloating&quot; in the nanotech age will definately be accellerated.  Just as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone can buy software with the promise of getting a free upgrade later 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on; I see companies that design for nanotech doing the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>In fact, probably, programmed upgradability using &quot;patented&quot; approaches
<BR>
will provide one way for companies to &quot;lock-in&quot; customers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I stated in my last post I am very concerned that federal governments 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will feel that for our own good these technologies (especially as they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve and mature) should be utilized directly only be licensed corporate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and government bodies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Thats why we discuss things like &quot;enclaves&quot;, moving into space, etc.
<BR>
They not only have to prohibit your using the technologies in your
<BR>
legal jurisdiction, they have to do it globally and in the entire
<BR>
solar system.  Very very hard.  Once you admit you can't control it
<BR>
the best you can do is attempt &quot;manage&quot; it.  Thats what is happening
<BR>
to encryption technology.  (Of course they will hopefully wake up
<BR>
soon and realize management is futile...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We see right now a fight going on for open-source code.  We see battles 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on in the U.S. and elsewhere over civil liberties.  Won't nanotech 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (especially as it matures) be the ultimate example of powerful institutions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting to control access to technology to control the people??  I see this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a much bigger question then even the development of the technology itself 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which now seems very likely.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but we will by then have many more examples of how people will creatively
<BR>
work around restrictions that governments try to impose.  I'll put my
<BR>
money on the creativity and desires of millions of people vs. a few
<BR>
thousand any day of the week.
