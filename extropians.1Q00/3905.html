James,
<BR>
<P>It was cool to get your message that the surgery went better then expected!  
<BR>
You had alot of people rooting for you, that is for certain.  I hope the 
<BR>
healing continues to progress well.  You must be right about only the good 
<BR>
dying young! :)
<BR>
<P>You will have a great deal to catch up on with the Extro list alone.  There 
<BR>
have been some interesting threads about qualia, skyhooks and my favorite, 
<BR>
the feasibility of cryonics as currently done, based on what mature nanotech 
<BR>
may be able to do later on to bring us back.  This thread is disturbing but 
<BR>
it's better to know both sides of an argument when your future life is at 
<BR>
stake.
<BR>
<P>Glad to see you're back!
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
