<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Without an easily accessible purchase-prohibited registry which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; must be checked prior to sale, such laws are unenforceable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; especially as regards to violent criminals who have done their time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and MOST especially as to violent repeat offenders who have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; served their sentences, but also including those who have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; restraining orders issued against them, and the incompetent or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insane.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If they have done their time, and are rehabilitated, they are no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a threat to society, so once their parole period is up, give them back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;their rights. If they are a threat, don't let them out of prison. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;is such a simple concept.
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Then you are on record as advocating life without possibility of parole for anyone convicted of using a gun in a crime?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If they have been ajudged by a parole board to no longer be a threat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;society, then give them back their rights. If they remain a threat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;society, then lock them away for keeps, or at least until a parole board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;does make a rehabilitated decision.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are willing to trust the decisions of a parole board, you must also trust &gt; in the good faith of other agencies, including mental competency boards and judges &gt; issuing restraining orders.  One cannot cherry-pick which of these to and not to &gt; trust based upon preconception-based preferences - they are all populated by &gt; people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Parole boards are comprised of private citizens, not government
<BR>
bureacrats. Parole boards, as they are currently constituted, are more
<BR>
concerned with keeping prison populations down. 
<BR>
<P>The thing is Joe, I SHOULD be able to trust the government. The reason I
<BR>
don't isn't because of me. They have demonstrated enough times in this
<BR>
administration that they have no respect for the law or the individual.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Although simply showing a gun in the commission of a crime may not be grounds 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for life imprisonment, I'm in favor of permanent lock-up of violent gun-wielding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminals who commit crimes resulting in firearm injury or death to others, for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have proven themselves capable of such actions by performing them; then the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospect of deaths from mistaken rights restoration to violent criminal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recidivists never enters in.  
</EM><BR>
<P>A good point. What about situations where a person was defending
<BR>
themselves, but didn't follow all of the points of the law in properly
<BR>
injuring or killing a criminal in the proper and legal way? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To pull the trigger on another human being in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commission of a crime should be to kill your own freedom to have the opportunity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do the same again for the rest of your life.
</EM><BR>
<P>It should. It does indicate that you have no respect for the right to
<BR>
life of the other person, which is why self defense with deadly force is
<BR>
justified in such circumstances. A person who has no value for the right
<BR>
to life of others doesn't have value for their own. 
<BR>
<P>Use of deadly force in the commission of a felony should be a capital
<BR>
crime. Just because the crook got lucky and didn't actually kill anyone
<BR>
is irrelevant. They were prepared to do so, and so mark themselves as
<BR>
mere animals to be put down.
