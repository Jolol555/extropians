I'm sure you don't, I have good anti-air defenses for flying things 15 cm in 
<BR>
size. My 20 guage shotgun that is perfect for woodcock, with #9 shot, would 
<BR>
take our your little spy plane at anything less than 50 yards, and with 
<BR>
magnum loads I could make shots of around 75-100 yards altitude. Anything 
<BR>
higher and I'd have to bring out the goose gun.... 10 guage #6 magnum 
<BR>
loads.... Happy flying....
<BR>
(end)

<P>If you and Spike were neighbors it would be the high-tech version of the 
<BR>
Hatfields and the McCoys!  You would at first hear the buzzing of his r.c. 
<BR>
plane but not get outside fast enough to shoot it down.  Then you would stay 
<BR>
outside in a lawn chair and blast the plane out of the sky.  This is 
<BR>
followed by you putting the r.c. plane on display in your driveway and 
<BR>
denouncing Spike for his imperialist ways in front of all the neighbors.
<BR>
<P>At this point Spike switches to a high-altitude balloon and so you bang out 
<BR>
a s.a.m. in your garage!  Upon shooting his craft down, Spike swears that it 
<BR>
was a crashed flying saucer and that you are part of a conspiracy that 
<BR>
switched the real evidence with a balloon!  He writes a best-selling book 
<BR>
that makes him rich and you wind up trying to fend off hordes of wierd 
<BR>
people that want to break into your house to meet the alien they think you 
<BR>
have locked up in the basement!
<BR>
<P>So this proves that it just doesn't pay to mess with Spike! lol
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
