<P><EM>&gt;Chandra just discovered the closest known black hole to earth, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1600 light years away. What would be really interesting is if it can find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any mini black holes, those about as massive as a mountain and made in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first second of the Big Bang. Such a beast would be super hot but so tiny
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would not be very bright, if one is found it would have be nearby and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would mean mini black holes are common.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If mini black holes were made in the big bang, and if they &quot;evaporate&quot;
<BR>
(unless refueled!), they would have been most numerous right after the big
<BR>
bang.  
<BR>
<P>Then they would have floated around the universe, expanding or wasting
<BR>
away, depending on the density of matter in their path.  Something of a
<BR>
scary image this.  Interstellar/intergalactic &quot;harvesters&quot; sweeping up the
<BR>
debris of the universe. 
<BR>
<P>Though after eons, the vast majority of them may have disappeared, starved
<BR>
by the ever-diminishing supply of fuel, yet in the early days they could
<BR>
have been a real scourge.  What happens when a mini black hole plunges into
<BR>
an earth, or a jupiter, or yet more dramatically, a star?  In the early
<BR>
days of the universe, how very much more common an occurrance could this
<BR>
have been?  Could this be the explanation of the Fermi Paradox?  Could this
<BR>
be Robin's &quot;Great Filter&quot;?  Would there be an x-ray afterglow of this
<BR>
feeding frenzy?  Some evidence coming to us from tens of billions of light
<BR>
years back in time?
<BR>
<P>Could intelligent life and advanced civilizations only now have the
<BR>
breathing room--the time to develop--because the rate of disruption of star
<BR>
system evolution has been reduced below a certain crucial threshold?  Could
<BR>
gamma ray bursts, now something of a mystery, be a reminder of a
<BR>
once-common cataclysm? 
<BR>
<P>My peek at this situation came not from CHANDRA, but from
<BR>
<P>&lt;The star splitter: Microlensing technique pioneered by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSF researchers finds black holes 
<BR>
<P>EurekAlert 13 Jan 2000
<BR>
<P>&lt; Two international teams of astronomers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently used
<BR>
another &quot;star splitter,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the technique of gravitational lensing, to examine another curiosity --
<BR>
isolated black holes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drifting among the stars in our galaxy
<BR>
<P>&lt;In 1936 Einstein predicted what an observer would see if a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very faint object with a strong gravitational field such as a black
<BR>
hole passed in front of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faint star. The black hole's gravity would act like a powerful lens,
<BR>
splitting the star's image
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into multiple images and making the star appear brighter.
<BR>
<P>&lt;Already, the MACHO astronomers have noted 300
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instances of gravitational microlensing near the central regions of our
<BR>
galaxy, each marking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passage of an unseen object in front of the star.
<BR>
<P>&lt;Bennett and his collaborators examined two microlensing events,&gt;
<BR>
<P>&lt;calculations of the location and brightness of the stars and the mass of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objects passing in front led the teams to conclude the objects were
<BR>
probably black holes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drifting through space 
<BR>
<P>Move over puny asteroid impacts!  For a really bad hair day nothing matches
<BR>
coming acropper of a derelict black hole.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
