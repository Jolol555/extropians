<EM>&gt; &gt; What is the difference between a &quot;simple&quot; nanobot attack and a complex

<EM>&gt; &gt; nanobot attack?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A small number of nanobots designed to simultaneously release a relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large quantity of a highly toxic poison long after they were delivered

<EM>&gt; to your body.

<P>My idea of a complex nanobot attack is one that you can slip into a population,
<BR>
such that, their brains are slowly changed to make them think that you are the
<BR>
New Messiah.  They get automatic endorphins when they think nice thoughts about
<BR>
you.  Weapons?, we don't need no stinking weapons.
<BR>
<P>Attacks based on nanotechnology will be able to take so many forms, that
<BR>
defensive attempts will always lag too far in the past to provide any
<BR>
confidence.  Don't limit your thinking to nanobots as a new biological model.
<BR>
Nanobots could form a hemispherical shell cloud 1/2 km from you (so thin you
<BR>
would not detect it), that suddenly detonates and sends a collapsing pressure
<BR>
wave to implode you.  Something else can come at you from under the ground, or
<BR>
even through the wires to your phone.  The phase space of destructive
<BR>
techniques is vast, and not something I should discuss here.  All it takes is a
<BR>
slight head start for one group with the will to try to have it all (or the
<BR>
fear of another).  I do not see how our traditional military policy is going to
<BR>
protect us.
