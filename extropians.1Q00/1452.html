<P>When I think of the horror that goes on in AMERICAN prisons I am sickened.  
<BR>
I remember growing up being told never wind up in a Turkish or Russian 
<BR>
prison, they're the BAD ones.  I think things are changing in terms of 
<BR>
public awareness but very slowly.  There are actually support groups for men 
<BR>
who have lived this nightmare but as J.R. would point out women get the 
<BR>
press on rape and not men in prison though I do not negate at all the 
<BR>
important progress in aiding and defending women.
<BR>
<P>I saw a PBS documentary where they showed the &quot;new breed&quot; of corporate 
<BR>
prisons where private companies actually took seriously the government 
<BR>
exhortation to build a better prison.  The corporate take on this was to 
<BR>
build a high-security prison that kept prisoners by themselves for about 23 
<BR>
hours of the day.  When they did eat or go to the yard it was for a brief 
<BR>
time and while watched by numerous guards.
<BR>
<P>This format was very effective at eliminating the violence, rape and 
<BR>
criminal trade that is so common in U.S. prisons.  Ironically civil 
<BR>
liberties organizations protested saying the prisoners were being 
<BR>
emotionallly damaged!  Some prisoners hated it because they wanted business 
<BR>
as usual but others thought it a safe haven because now they could relax and 
<BR>
not fear for their lives and bodies.
<BR>
<P>Could you imagine if the health food devotees of the U.S. gathered enough 
<BR>
power and influence to make illegal soft drinks, fast food and sugar-laden 
<BR>
cereals?  It sounds funny just thinking about it but that would be too much 
<BR>
for the american people!  But with all the money being made giving the 
<BR>
american people what they want I do not see it being eliminated anytime 
<BR>
soon.  That logical line of reasoning does go further though...  
<BR>
Law-enforcement agencies have never had it so good with the Rico act, every 
<BR>
shift begins the random treasure hunt for more revenue.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
