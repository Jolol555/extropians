<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I have read many of the posts on this thread and I'm mind boggled.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;if we are really talking about having some money to do something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;courageous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;with — what do you want to do? Live or die?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I call it a war on death.  The best defense is a cultural offense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yeah sure spreading longevity propaganda is a good idea.  But I think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a hard time getting John &amp; Jane Public to get on board until we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eliminate (or at least substantially reduce) world poverty and hunger.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mean the obvious response is: &quot;What?!?  There are *millions* of starving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people in the world who don't have access to decent medical care, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; water or residential and communication infrastructures and you want us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work on giving them indefinite life spans?  Are you mad?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I had $100 million to donate I think it would go toward biotech 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; geared toward increasing world food production and social programs 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;geared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; toward more equitable and efficient food distribution and medical care.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; also like to see more aggressive efforts to bring computers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; communication infrastructures to more of the developing world.  Once you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a relatively prosperous and informed world population, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bit will be a much easier sell.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1. This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical care and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;longevity can both be financed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I realize that.  I was responding to Natasha who emphasized the need to 
<BR>
counter the ubiquitous &quot;deathist&quot; meme.  My point was simply that it will be 
<BR>
much easier to get people to support longevity research once it is clear 
<BR>
that the environment will be able to support 10 billion people who like to 
<BR>
make babies but don't like to die.  It is hard to convince people that 
<BR>
indefinite life spans won't presently sap our environmental and agricultural 
<BR>
resources when people now typically only live less than 80 years and yet a 
<BR>
good percentage of us are living in poverty and starving.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
</EM><BR>
<P>I question whether $100 million would have very much impact on longevity 
<BR>
research.  My guess is that there is currently at least that much being 
<BR>
spent right now on aging research and other research that will be of value 
<BR>
to life extensionists.  And sure $100 million would not end hunger, but you 
<BR>
could damn sure build a lot of irrigation with it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;3. Longevity research may well advance &quot;normal&quot; medical care in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that purely investing in &quot;normal&quot; medical care would never accomplish.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example, if one were to find a generic vaccine that made humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immune to most or all viruses, that would have immediate applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;toward preventing people from getting sick - but such is much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely to be discovered by researchers looking to minimize health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems over infinite lives, as opposed to researchers looking to just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let people live long enough to die at 60 or 70.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but I still maintain that if you couch it in terms like immortality 
<BR>
or indefinite life span research, you are simply not going to make any 
<BR>
headway with the public, at least until we have global poverty, ignorance 
<BR>
and hunger already under control.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;4. For the past several centuries, there have been some in the world who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have lived better than the others.  One way to introduce immortality for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone would be to introduce it for the rich first, then as time goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on - and the technology becomes more familiar and (one hopes)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simpler/less expensive - introduce it to everyone else.  (&quot;Poverty&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these days is not quite as hard a life as &quot;poverty&quot; was 100 years ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least in almost any industrialized country, due in part to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practice.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh sure, that's likely to go over *really* well.  &quot;Hey, lets all fund a 
<BR>
bunch of way-out research so Bill Gates can live forever, while millions of 
<BR>
kids in the third world (not to mention a few thousand right in the good old 
<BR>
US of A) go to bed hungry every night.&quot;  Nobody's going to touch that with a 
<BR>
10 foot pole.  Not Republicans, not Democrats, nobody.
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong.  I wish there was a bunch more research being done on 
<BR>
nano, cryo and immortality.  But the only way to get funding for such 
<BR>
research is to convince people that there money is better spent there than 
<BR>
somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time 
<BR>
convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on like 
<BR>
feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6 billion 
<BR>
people we already share this planet with.
<BR>
