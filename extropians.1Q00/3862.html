<P>That attack on logical positivism has always bothered me.
<BR>
<P>I usually see this attack directed at some form of matieralism (&quot;Matieralism
<BR>
can't explain emotions.&quot;) The answer for that is &quot;Yes it can, emotions are
<BR>
patterns of neuron firings in the brain.&quot; (c.f. Dennett, Hofstadter).
<BR>
<P>Could a similar defense work for logical positivism? Given empirical
<BR>
knowledge of how human (or any other kind of) mind(s) work, don't
<BR>
philosophical systems and ideas become just as matieralistic and examinable
<BR>
as computer programs?
<BR>
<P>The biggest problem with epistimelogy seems to be a lot of the philosophers
<BR>
seem to be trapped in vitalism mode, continuing to assume that cognition and
<BR>
perception are not mechanistic, inherently comprehensible physical
<BR>
processes. Some of the weirdness I've seen in epistimology makes a lot more
<BR>
sense if it is understood as attempts by philosophers to avoid an infinite
<BR>
regress (&quot;We think we think we think we think ... like this.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>Aside: &quot;source-code&quot;, or &quot;domdule&quot; level understanding of the structure of
<BR>
the human mind could tell us, once and for all, in real physical terms,
<BR>
exactly what humans mean by &quot;mean&quot; (assuming most humans use isomorphic
<BR>
mental machinery for these sorts of cognitive operations, which seems
<BR>
reasonable). Epistimelogy would become empirically descriptive, and we'ed
<BR>
have some sort of physical base on which to build a philosophy .
<BR>
<P>This is the sort of stuff I was hoping to see when I started studying
<BR>
psychology. Boy was I in for a disappointment :)

<BR>
<P>P.S. I think Eliezer said it best when he observed that when one attempts to
<BR>
bottom out human formal systems like physics or math or philosophy, one
<BR>
finds human semantic primitives, not universal ontological primitives.
