<P>
The irritating thing about this (and I've only seen the article in
<BR>
Monday's
<BR>
New York Times and the interview in the Washington Post; I haven't read
<BR>
the Wired article yet) is not that the man is nervous, but the
<BR>
tone of sanctimonious self-aggrandizement inherent, for example, in
<BR>
the comparison to Albert Einstein in 1939 writing his wake-up letter
<BR>
to Franklin Roosevelt.  When did Bill Joy acquire the gravitas in the
<BR>
public consciousness that made Einstein the appropriate person for such
<BR>
a gesture in '39?  While I am conscious of Mr. Joy as the author of
<BR>
the text editor I use daily (I've never learned Emacs, to my shame!),
<BR>
I suspect that to the general public, the proper name &quot;Joy&quot; is more
<BR>
likely to be associated with dishwashing detergent than with Berkeley
<BR>
UNIX or Sun Microsystems.  Also, could it be that Mr. Joy has only just
<BR>
now woken up to these possibilities -- perhaps he's had enough spare
<BR>
time on his hands recently to surf the Web or catch up on his reading?
<BR>
(at least the recent books by Kurzweil and Moravec were acknowledged in
<BR>
the Times article).
