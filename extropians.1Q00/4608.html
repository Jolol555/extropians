<EM>&gt;  If two people agree to an exchange where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cash changes hands, then presumably its an even trade, i.e. no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; income or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capital gain is realized. If this is so, how can it be taxed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A dealer or trader who operates as a sole proprietorship business files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Form 1040 Schedule C and reports his gross cash income from exchanges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during the year, and deducts the cash cost of goods and qualified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business expenses, and reports the fair market value of his trade goods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventory as of the end of each year.  It makes little difference whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he does cash deals or strictly barter; either way the net profit will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show up on Schedule C.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suppose you start the year with a pig worth $50 (fair mkt value you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reported) and no cash.  The pig is your inventory and it has a fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market value of $50. You trade the pig for a horse.  At this point it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't matter tax-wise what the horse is worth, to you, or to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else.  Then you trade the horse for a saddle.  Again, at this point it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't matter tax-wise what the saddle is worth, to you, or to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else.  You trade the saddle for a cow.   You trade the cow for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motorcycle.  You trade the motorcycle for a car.  Then you trade the car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for another car, and the tax year has ended.  You still have no cash, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do not have the pig you started with, but you do have a car.  The car is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your inventory.  Say it has a fair market value of $1,000.  That is your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end of year inventory value.  There has been no cash income and no cash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expenses or cash cost of goods, so the net Schedule C income for the year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is $1000 - $50 = $950.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what you are saying is that even if you still own the car, and every
<BR>
trade was considered even at the time of the trade by the participants,
<BR>
that you have to pay a tax on the increase value of the property, even
<BR>
if you haven't sold the property? Thats bogus. Property taxes are direct
<BR>
taxes and are not legal for the feds to impose. This is really annoying
<BR>
me. I'll have to do some research on this issue.
