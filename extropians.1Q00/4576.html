<EM>&gt; So if you and I bought houses in Bay Area 50 years ago for $30K apiece,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now want to swap them (while they have the estimated market value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of $1M each), each of us will have to pay about $300,000 ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for that, each of us would have to sell the house and move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to some God-forgotten area like Boston?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the general idea of the barter rules is that the tax consequences
<BR>
are supposed to be the same as if you did it for cash.  So the result
<BR>
would be the same as if you each sold your residences and then bought
<BR>
the other.
<BR>
<P>There is a tax exemption to avoid paying taxes on the appreciated value of
<BR>
your primary residence if you buy a new house of equal or greater value.
<BR>
There is also a one-time lifetime exemption you can use for when you go
<BR>
from a large family-raising house to a small retirement house.  (I'm not
<BR>
familiar with the specific details, this is just the general idea.)
<BR>
So you might not actually have to pay taxes on an exchange like this,
<BR>
or at least one of you might not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if people swap &quot;usage rights&quot;.  I still &quot;own&quot; my house,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you owe yours, but we swap usage rights for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Shadow ownership of sorts.   Same for everything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You still &quot;own&quot; the groceries, I am just digesting them  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there is a lot of fine print in the tax regulations to try
<BR>
to catch this kind of creative thinking.  Things like how many days
<BR>
you actually occupy a house, etc.  No doubt much of this language was
<BR>
inserted in response to people coming up with loopholes.
<BR>
