<P><EM>&gt;Hey, I love Eli like a son (not necessarily the most favorable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comparison, if one reads his autobiographic sketch, but still...), 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;admire the hell out of his smarts and articulateness, but let's not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forget that so far all he's done is talk a good game.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Even that might be putting it a little strongly: the only formal AI 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expert on the list, Robin Hanson, has expressed misgivings over 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Eliezer's broad-brush and non-canonical  algorithms/heuristics, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I haven't seen anyone cluey like Moravec or Vinge rush to adopt his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;schemata, although they both know about his site.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm going to delurk for a moment to give my 2-cents. I'm an AI 
<BR>
researcher (starting my masters in AI) and I've had a good look at 
<BR>
Eliezer's written work.
<BR>
<P>Yes, it is a lot of talk, and yes there are plenty of problems with 
<BR>
it. Much of it being very high level -- it's like trying to make the 
<BR>
whole enchilada when we still don't know how to refry beans or make 
<BR>
tortillas.
<BR>
<P>*However*, to Eliezer's credit -- of *course* it will have problems 
<BR>
at this stage. He is trying to tackle the &quot;hard problem&quot; of AI for 
<BR>
bob's sake.  There is little out there that rivals his work. 
<BR>
Researchers simply can't publish work like this in the social setting 
<BR>
science is practiced in these days.
<BR>
<P>CaThAI really is impressive -- Eliezer is definately a smart cookie. 
<BR>
I sure could not have put so comprehensive a document together. My 
<BR>
prediction is that as AI continues to progress and Eileizer continues 
<BR>
to learn more, nearly all of his plans will need rewriting, and 
<BR>
refinement. There's too much there that it will all turn out to be 
<BR>
correct. I'm sure Eliezer knows this. But he will be there with 
<BR>
newer, more powerful ideas to replace his old ones.
<BR>
<P>For all its shortcomings, which really can not be avoided, I have yet 
<BR>
to see a better, or more organized plan to accomplish the same goal. 
<BR>
You have to start somewhere. This is why I am a Singularitarian. The 
<BR>
Singularity Institute should be considered for funding, and it should 
<BR>
be staffed with lots of non-conformist AI researchers, like Yudkowsky.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;From comments on this list, I get the impression that many list 
<BR>
members imagine the &quot;mad scientist&quot; scenario where Eliezer locks 
<BR>
himself in his room for 5 years coding feverishly night after night 
<BR>
until *WHAMMO* his seed AI takes root and blossoms into a 
<BR>
Singularity. Not likely. As Eliezer has stated, this is a massive 
<BR>
undertaking. It will take lots of money, lots of time, lots of 
<BR>
computing power, and lots of brilliant people.
<BR>
<P>This is just the beginning folks. You ain't seen nuthin' yet.
<BR>
<P>I wish I could post more but I have to get back to working on AI ;-)
