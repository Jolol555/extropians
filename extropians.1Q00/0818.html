<P>
Damien,
<BR>
<P>This is a linear run-through of what you sent to me.
<BR>
Lord only knows on the original order, but I assume
<BR>
you know where this stuff is ending up.
<BR>
<P>=========================================================================
<BR>
<P>Re: Damon Knight's &quot;A for Anything&quot; &amp; assembler monopolies.
<BR>
<P>The problem with this is that the technologies you need to construct
<BR>
assemblers are going to become increasingly commonplace.  If trends
<BR>
in the miniaturization of disk drives continue, I expect in a few
<BR>
years people could disassemble a couple of disk drives and have much
<BR>
of the hardware required for precise 2-D positioning.  You can generate
<BR>
buckytube AFM tips in an electric arc device with carbon electrodes.
<BR>
Any hobbyist can now purchase peizoelectric positioners, lasers for
<BR>
measuring tip position, etc.  In short it will be extremely hard to
<BR>
control access to the materials you need to produce AFMs, from there
<BR>
the path to assemblers is only a matter of creativity and time.
<BR>
<P>An entirely alternate path would use protein synthesizers available
<BR>
in most university molecuar biology departments.  Do your design
<BR>
on a computer, synthesize the proteins, let them self-assemble and
<BR>
voila...
<BR>
<P>So I'm very doubtful that limited access to these technologies will
<BR>
be a reality, unless a substantial majority of people supports this
<BR>
for safety reasons.  (I.e. designs must be verified as safe before
<BR>
assembly.)  This is kind of like &quot;speed limits&quot;.  Everyone hates
<BR>
them, but generally agrees they are required and conforms &quot;more
<BR>
or less&quot; to the rules.
<BR>
<P><P>Re: Neal Stephanson's &quot;drab uniformity&quot; of public-access nanomaterials.
<BR>
<P>This seems doubtful as well, since one would suspect pressure for
<BR>
publicly supported competitions or simple artistic expression to
<BR>
produce creative designs.  Unless the human &quot;ego&quot; disappears with
<BR>
the nanoera, there will always be people who derive satisfaction
<BR>
from observing people driving &quot;their&quot; cars, wearing &quot;their&quot; clothes,
<BR>
living in &quot;their&quot; houses, etc.  The fact is that in a &quot;free support for
<BR>
the masses&quot; era, creative people will have that much more time
<BR>
and opportunity to design things that eliminate the uniformity.
<BR>
<P>Re: My analysis of assembly of food, houses, swimming pools, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Start by buying an acre of cheap land somewhere with at least modest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sunshine. Your nano compiler will grow you solar cells that cover most
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the land, providing 400,000 watts a day, powering the compilation of
</EM><BR>
around
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 kilos of materials per hour.
</EM><BR>
<P>After some discussion of this with Robert Freitas, it seems I may have
<BR>
been a bit generous with the available power levels on the surface of
<BR>
the Earth.  It may be something like 1370W/m^2 in the upper atmosphere
<BR>
but at the surface, in the visible region most effective for power
<BR>
harvesting, it may only be ~400W/m^2.  To be on the conservative,
<BR>
you might want to adjust this by saying something like &quot;several (2-8?)
<BR>
acres of land, depending on your latitude and cloud cover&quot;, that
<BR>
probably provides a sufficent &quot;fudge factor&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sounds mad. Actually, friendly critics swiftly pointed out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bradbury's 1999 estimates might be too cautious by a factor of 100.
</EM><BR>
<P>My limits are &quot;ecological&quot;, not &quot;physical&quot; (perhaps, worth point out
<BR>
a little more clearly than is mentioned, since it implies to the
<BR>
&quot;greens&quot;
<BR>
that we *are* thinking ecologically!).  My limits were sharply
<BR>
constrained
<BR>
by heat limits that dictate the total mass &amp; energy of nano-constructors
<BR>
per
<BR>
person (Nanomedicine, Volume I, pg 175) Robert's power limits are less
<BR>
than
<BR>
mine (~100W/person), so you would have to have a family of 3-4 people to
<BR>
<P>&quot;allowably&quot; use 400KW/day.  Now (obviously), you can store waste heat
<BR>
and
<BR>
radiate it at night, construct cooling towers into the stratosphere
<BR>
or &quot;save&quot; (in a virtual-bank) nano-constructor operating time (you can
<BR>
have it now, but you have to pay it back in the future (with interest)
<BR>
or use some fraction of it to increase the global cooling capacity).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bradbury, recall, opted for 400 KW. But with all that excess carbon
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; drained from the atmosphere, putting the Greenhouse effect
</EM><BR>
conveniently into
<BR>
<EM>&gt; reverse, we might need all the heat we can get.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very nice touch!!!   Perhaps ... &quot;Bradbury, whose father served on
<BR>
his home town's conservation commission, conservatively opted for
<BR>
400 KW... :-)
<BR>
<P>Re: Fermi Paradox
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps the nearest to such a explicit perspective is the `dirt'
</EM><BR>
theory
<BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested ebulliently, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Stephen Witham.
</EM><BR>
`Any
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently advanced communication,' he proposes, with a nod to
</EM><BR>
Arthur C.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Clarke, `is indistinguishable from noise.
</EM><BR>
<P>A good point, also made by Minsky at one of the early SETI conferences.
<BR>
{ Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings
<BR>
of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan,
<BR>
USSR, Sept. 5-11, 1971 (Ed: Carl Sagan, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1973)
<BR>
}
<BR>
Heaven help us if the Aliens decide to use spread spectrum frequency
<BR>
shifting to lower their power requirements.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, computer design is well understood, and data routing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit-exchanges don't look one whit like noisy dirt. Get out of here!
</EM><BR>
<P>Whomever said this should leave their computer modem speaker &quot;on&quot;
<BR>
when they connect at anything above 4800-9600 bps.  It sounds like
<BR>
static.  They don't understand anything about Shannon's theories.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  This universe of Lem's, torn asunder in conflict over its very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture by titanic Exes and Powers, is saved from utter ruin by
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; laws of game-theory, which ensure that the former combatants must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; henceforth remain in strict isolation from each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that you can conclude this from game theory.  Game
<BR>
theory states that both parties can come out ahead *if* you trust
<BR>
each other.  Now, if Robert Freitas is correct, and advanced
<BR>
civilizations evolve to maximize the sentience quotient of the
<BR>
universe, then &quot;discovering ways to trust&quot; becomes a major goal.
<BR>
So, remaining in strict isolation, *might* promote longevity,
<BR>
but it may not promote maximization of knowledge or wisdom.
<BR>
It begs the question of whether it is better to simply survive --
<BR>
knowing you are less than you could be -- or whether living life
<BR>
in the fast lane, rising to the peaks of success, only to leave a
<BR>
pretty corpse (if you bargained poorly with the devil) is a better way
<BR>
to go.  Fundamentally -- do civilizations choose to &quot;shoot the rapids&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Something professional cosmologists fail to acknowledge (I can see
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; faces screwing up already) is that the observable universe might
</EM><BR>
indeed be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; at least somewhat engineered.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen their faces -- its the sign of the cross that believers
<BR>
present to ward off vampires!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; True, the earliest stars would have been deficient in heavy elements,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but there have been stars like the Sun for many hundreds of millions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if not billions of years longer than our own 5 billion year-old star.
</EM><BR>
<P>Kardashev has spoken to this in several papers.  Since the heavy element
<BR>
<P>producing stars go supernova within a few hundred million years and the
<BR>
current estimates for the age of the universe are ~15+ billion years&quot;,
<BR>
it is *highly* likely that the basic requirements for &quot;life like ours&quot;
<BR>
have existed for a period between 5 and 10 billion years before our
<BR>
solar system even came into existence.  We are 2nd or 3rd generation
<BR>
galactic inhabitants.  Only if the probabilities for the evolution
<BR>
of intelligent life are very very rare indeed has there been no
<BR>
previous Spike.
<BR>
<P>Re: M-Brains and seeing them
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    That's the intriguing question. Obviously the entire radiation
</EM><BR>
budget of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a blazing star has to be re-transmitted by the outermost shell--but it
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; spread across a radiating surface at least as wide as the orbit of the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Earth, and recovered from the bottom of the thermodynamic cascade. So
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; star will look dim, exceedingly dim. Maybe so very dim that even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nine-tenths of the cosmos is already transformed in M-Brains, all
</EM><BR>
you'll
<BR>
<EM>&gt; easily detect will be the influence of their stars' gravity. They will
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; be... dark matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, a very &quot;young&quot; M-Brain, might have a shell of earth-orbit size
<BR>
<P>(constructed in a few dozens of years).  Older M-Brains (after large
<BR>
planet dismantlement) would have shells of Neptune or Pluto (or even
<BR>
greater)
<BR>
orbit size.  The fundamental constraints are (a) how much power is the
<BR>
sun
<BR>
producing; and (b) what is the size of the shell needed to radiate that
<BR>
power at slightly above the background temperature; and (c) is there
<BR>
enough
<BR>
material in the solar system to radiate that power at that temperature?
<BR>
For our solar system, without stellar mining, we can probably build
<BR>
shells out to Neptune, but after that things get a little bit
<BR>
questionable.
<BR>
<P><P>The fascinating thing is that M-brains &quot;evolve&quot; as they accumulate more
<BR>
radiator material from their &quot;giant&quot; planets and eventually their star
<BR>
(using star-lifting).  The older they are the colder they are and less
<BR>
visible they are.
<BR>
<P>Re: D.B. question on a previous post
<BR>
<EM>&gt; [one question - why did you say `diamondoid biochemistry system'
</EM><BR>
rather
<BR>
<EM>&gt; than `diamondoid chemistry system'? Slip of the typer? Or do you think
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; carbon will be positionally assembled by enzymes or some such?]
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably because I'm thinking more in terms of a &quot;biochemistry&quot;
<BR>
mind-set.  It might be interesting to think in terms of an &quot;ecological
<BR>
system&quot; (I think Forrest Bishop thinks more this way).  If you
<BR>
get locked into &quot;bio&quot; meaning &quot;life&quot;, then this narrows your point
<BR>
of view, and it takes some exploration of what life really is --
<BR>
&quot;Life is a negentropic and self-organizing aperiodic crystal&quot;
<BR>
(Xenology, Chapter 6) to open the mindset a bit.
<BR>
<P>Since ideally in a very efficient system, we would not only build
<BR>
diamondoid/saphire/tungsten-carbide components but recycle the
<BR>
&quot;undamanged&quot; (by radiation) components as efficiently as possible,
<BR>
I tend to think of this as &quot;biochemistry&quot;, since one of the hallmarks
<BR>
of biology is that for the most common reactions it tries to be as
<BR>
conservative with energy utilization as possible.
<BR>
<P>Probably more accurately it would be &quot;nano-ecology systems&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [R.B.] draw a useful distinction between three distinct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orders of nano minting: self-replication and self-assembly (both of
</EM><BR>
which
<BR>
<EM>&gt; life already does, and which biosynthesis methods will emulate) and
</EM><BR>
precise
<BR>
<EM>&gt; molecular assembly, which will allow us to build mansions and
</EM><BR>
spaceships
<BR>
<EM>&gt; out of diamond.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, current bacteria &amp; eukaryotic cells *do* do all three
<BR>
(self-replication, self-assembly and molecular assembly).  You
<BR>
may want to draw the distinction between soft/wet molecular assembly
<BR>
(biology) and hard/dry assembly (diamondoid/saphiroid/etc.) for which
<BR>
we currently have no &quot;live&quot; prototypes and only hypothesis of how
<BR>
we might construct the new &quot;nano-ecologies&quot;.  My main point is that
<BR>
hardest part (&quot;hard&quot; molecular assembly), need not be solved to have
<BR>
most of the advantages of &quot;nanotech&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...Bradbury observes, is limited by the strength of materials
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like bone, hydroxyapatite (teeth), sea-shells and bamboo--somewhat
</EM><BR>
lower
<BR>
<EM>&gt; than steel and concrete. But semi-intelligent pieces of steel or
</EM><BR>
concrete
<BR>
<EM>&gt; could self-assemble, or bamboo-beamed houses could `grow' themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is documented in Nanomedicine, Volume I, pg 295.  There is only
<BR>
a moderately small difference between the strength (Young's Modulus)
<BR>
of wood (~1x10^10 N/m^2), bone (~2-3x10^10), Nautilus shells
<BR>
(4.4x10^10),
<BR>
enamel (7.5x10^10), steel (1.9x10^11) and diamond (1x10^12).  The less
<BR>
than ~two orders of magnitude strength difference translates to roughly
<BR>
a 1 order of magnitude difference in areal dimensions.   As a first
<BR>
order
<BR>
approximation a 2&quot;x6&quot; wood support would tranlsate to a ~1 in^2
<BR>
diamondoid
<BR>
support.  (Please note this is not exact, I need formulas that are back
<BR>
in Seattle to do this conversion completely accurately.)
<BR>
<P>For wood, bone, shells and enamel, we already have the nanoassemblers.
<BR>
For steel we need &quot;intelligent&quot; MEMS driven self-assembly.  Only for
<BR>
the final step of diamondoid molecularly assembled, self-assembled,
<BR>
self-replicating machines do we need a significant amount of &quot;new&quot;
<BR>
invention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interestingly, methods for achieving these small interim breakthroughs
</EM><BR>
were
<BR>
<EM>&gt; worked out several decades ago, before nano-engineering had been
</EM><BR>
suggested.
<BR>
<P>Damien, if you are refering, to von Neuman's self-replicating machines
<BR>
or the NASA study on self-replication, this statement should be
<BR>
footnoted
<BR>
or referenced (it took me a while to understand what you might mean).
<BR>
If you are refering to the subsequent discussion of Santa Machines
<BR>
(ala Theodore Taylor), then it is ok, though back references to
<BR>
von Neumann and the NASA study would be useful.
<BR>
<P>Thats it for this batch.  I think there is one more commentary
<BR>
re: &quot;final summing up&quot; to go.
<BR>
