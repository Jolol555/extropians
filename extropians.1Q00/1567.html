<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, cryobiology is not the only field I mentioned.  Antiaging research

is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the other.  What of that?  If one can develop a good model of aging at
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cellular or molecular level, then finding new ways to combat it would
</EM><BR>
seem
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to me to be a lot easier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aeiveos Sciences Group
</EM><BR>
<P>URL?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; started on that with the differential gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expression studies (at the tissue level).  The problem is the technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't available yet to provide the information base at the cellular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level.   You could just about do it if you could tease out single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells from frozen tissues, do quantitative PCR on the mRNA in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells and then do differential display analysis (to see how gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expression levels differ in young, middle-aged and old animals).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But you are talking difficult methods and very high costs here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I imagine so.
<BR>
<P>I also question whether gene expression is everything here.  I know it's an
<BR>
important part of understanding how life works.  (In other words, spare me
<BR>
the lecture on what genes do.:)  But the narrow focus on it leaves out
<BR>
everything else, don't you think?  Another way of putting this:  Is most
<BR>
aging a failure of gene expression?  (Using &quot;failure&quot; here to cover things
<BR>
not working as they did when someone was young -- so that the failure of an
<BR>
oncogene to express itself would not be considered a _failure_ in the abvoe
<BR>
sense.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You really need the gene expression chips for the human genome *and*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lab that can use lasers to excise single cells.  Otherwise the picture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get is that of tissue aggregates that tell you little about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;cellular aging&quot;.  Then there is a separate problem of how you get people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sit still for a few hundred needle biopsies into various organs
</EM><BR>
(doctors
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and hospital facilities to do these don't come cheap).  You could do the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; studies in mice, but it remains an open question how well understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aging in short-lived animals will translate to understanding aging in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-lived animals.  My feeling is that you will get a partial picture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd guess in 3-5 years researchers should be able to begin working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this aggressively with it only costing half an arm.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have a huge pool of aging people in the West...  Even if they volunteer
<BR>
for some of these tests, that would not cover the costs of the tests
<BR>
themselves.  How much do you think that cost would be now per person?
<BR>
<P>I wonder if the Life Extension Foundation has tried to make an outreach to
<BR>
its members to gather statistics on them.  That might help, since some of
<BR>
them are already purchasing various blood tests as well as taking
<BR>
supplements.  (I'm assuming this because they sell the stuff.:)  I don't
<BR>
know how many people buy these blood tests.
<BR>
<P>I also assume that the medical establishments around the world maintain some
<BR>
records of when they've done some of these tests.  How much of that data is
<BR>
up for grabs?  How much of it can be purchased?  What is its quality and the
<BR>
follow up rates?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; From the looks of it, it appears most research in this area is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; identify a mechanism, find something that inhibits it, look for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; similar things to that inhibitor, and so forth.  Am I right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep.  Fundamentally however you have to deal with the problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutating DNA.  A point I made perhaps 7+ years ago on one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aging newsgroups was as follows -- if ~30% of people die from cancer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it takes only ~5 mutations in specific sensitive locations in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a subset of a few hundred tumor suppressor/promoter genes (those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulating cell division) in a *single* cell in your body, then *what*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you think is happening in all of the other genes in all of the cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that *aren't* involved in getting cancer?  [There is a really good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper in this idea that I should write now that Nanomedicine is out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most of the numbers are at my fingertips...]
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume that DNA are constantly undergoing mutations anyway.  Most of it,
<BR>
and this is my guess borrowed from Kimura (the Neutral Theory of Selection
<BR>
guy), is harmless or has no effect.  At least, I bet it has no or little
<BR>
effect in the short run.  As we live longer, I would think that not only do
<BR>
the mutations add up, but that some that would be harmless at one age might
<BR>
not be so at another.  I'm just speculating here and don't have that much
<BR>
knowledge of the field.  (So forgive me if I sound more like a drunk at the
<BR>
corner tavern, then a biology student.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There aren't going to be any *easy* mechanisms for inhibiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA damage that don't involve some major genetic enhancements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The best we might hope to obtain without some major re-engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is flipping the switches to reduce-the-damage/increase-the-repair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to levels found in children.  That might slow the accumulation, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt it will stop it.
</EM><BR>
<P>My hope is you live a little longer, the science understands more, the
<BR>
technology gets better at antiaging, and repeat.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; A simulated aging cell could be used to more efficiently search for
</EM><BR>
aging
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inhibitors and therapies, no?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps, but its way beyond our capabilities now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NM [pg 115] - neuron volume: 14,000 microns^3, NM: [pg 384], molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volume of water (ignoring solutes &amp; proteins since the density is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hugely different): 0.0299 nm^3/molecule.  If I'm doing the math right,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that looks to be about 4.7x10^14 atoms.  Even a bacteria works out to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.5x10^11 atoms.  Given the max atomic level simulations now are at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a billion atoms, if we assume a generous Moore's Law that hits no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bumps providing a doubling every year, that means you don't get capacity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for bacteria simulations until 2007 and neuron cell simulations until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around 2018. The &quot;Blue Gene&quot; machine from IBM might speed this up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a little but we are still up against the wall of computational limits.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was not aware of the exact numbers, though thought they would look
<BR>
daunting.  I'm sure we can make simplifying assumptions here.  For instance,
<BR>
if we can model just one part of the cell membrane, we might come to a
<BR>
better understanding of freezing damage at that site.  Surely, it will not
<BR>
be an exact fit, but the map is never the road, right?  This doesn't stop
<BR>
people from driving from LA to NYC.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, the nice thing about this, is that since the code exists for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modeling very precise radiation hazards and one would expect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free radical effects to be accounted for in the cell model, we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to model very accurately how and where the DNA is being damaged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *and* test various interventions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was unaware some modeling has been done in this area.  That is good to
<BR>
hear.  Perhaps, it's just a matter of tweaking an existing modeling to suit
<BR>
our needs.  Who is doing the aforementioned modeling?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then finally, we just might settle the entire damn anti-oxidant supplement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debate once and for all.
</EM><BR>
<P>And open new, more productive lines of antiaging and cryobiology research.
