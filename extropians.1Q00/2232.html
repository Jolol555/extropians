If cryonics is physically/mathematically possible, then it is
<BR>
technologically possible, and barring a return to the dark ages, will be
<BR>
technologically feasible. What I mean by physically/mathematically possible
<BR>
is that there may not be enough information in a frozen brain to interpolate
<BR>
what the corresponding working brain looked like. Suppose my brain is
<BR>
frozen, it changes from (unfrozen) state Z to (frozen) state Z'. If for all
<BR>
(frozen) x', there is one-and-only-one corresponding (unfrozen) x, then a
<BR>
few billion nanocomputers running in parallel and given a 3D scan of my
<BR>
frozen brain (Z') should be able to figure out how to put everything back
<BR>
together into Z. However, it may be that too much information is lost,
<BR>
perhaps there are several different possible states that can result in a
<BR>
frozen Z'.
<BR>
I toyed with the idea of proving that it's possible, today, using AI
<BR>
computer vision techniques. The idea would be to come up with a computer
<BR>
vision program which can look at microscopic slides of groups of cells that
<BR>
had been frozen and are suffering ice damage, and return a picture of what
<BR>
the group of cells looked like before being frozen. Use a neural net, and
<BR>
train it on several (thousand) examples, where you have photos of the cell
<BR>
group both before and after freezing, so you can use the correct examples to
<BR>
train the net. After much learning, if it's possible, and if it's designed
<BR>
correctly and has enough computing power, it should be able to get it right.
<BR>
Unfortunately, I know very little about implementing the techniques of
<BR>
computer vision.
