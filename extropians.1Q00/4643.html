<EM>&gt; &gt; Ok Mike, if that is the case, what can we do to Network Solutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to convince them that treating people the way they do (like they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;own&quot; the domain names), will in the long run come back to bite them.

<EM>&gt; The only way to fight that fight is with money. Assuming you have gobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and gobs of it, you start your own domain name registration service, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get ICANN, or WIPO or whoever it is now that oversees and approves new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domain name registry services to let you get into the business. Possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create your own new top level domains (rather than .com .net .web, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use .sys, .inc, .corp, .home, etc....) Once you have done this, sell
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, no reason really to try to go through ICANN. No laws preventing
<BR>
you from setting up your own registry right now. The trick is getting
<BR>
people's operating systems to utilize your registry. The DNS resolvers
<BR>
of existing OSs can be setup to check whatever root servers you
<BR>
like for a resolution, so it is not technically difficult to get
<BR>
people to use your service. You just have to somehow convince everyone
<BR>
to setup their computers to do it...
<BR>
<P>It would be nice to have some kind of system whereby DNS servers
<BR>
could automatically be notified of new registries, sort of like how
<BR>
newsgroups are created. The server admin can setup the dns server
<BR>
to automatically add these new registries, or he can manually ok
<BR>
them all. I really don't see a reason why not to do this. What is
<BR>
the logic ICANN is using to not allow as many TLDs as people would
<BR>
like?
