<P>
Ian Goddard has recently posted several messages concerning possible
<BR>
cases of Prozac causing aggressive behavior;  in these posts he's stated
<BR>
that the mechanism of this aggression is the same as in PCP, quoting an
<BR>
MD as saying that both drugs are SSRIs ( Selective Serotonin Reuptake
<BR>
Inhibitors).  This quoted party is wrong.
<BR>
<P>The error lies in that PCP is not selective
<BR>
in its actions;  it affects several other 
<BR>
neurotransmitters.  Prozac acts only on the serotonergic system, hence
<BR>
the term selective.  As a pharmacist, I feel the need to clarify such
<BR>
inaccuracies, esp. when they come from MDs (who really
<BR>
aren't as familiar with drugs as you might think). Equating Prozac &amp; PCP 
<BR>
because both influence serotonin is like equating Tylenol &amp; Heroin
<BR>
because both can stop a headache.
<BR>
<P>Please note, I'm not disputing that Prozac can cause aggression;  I've
<BR>
seen patients 
<BR>
have this reaction, but it's fairly rare.  PCP
<BR>
on the other hand is very likely to cause
<BR>
aggression in any given user.                    
<BR>
It's definitely been my experience that Prozac is prescribed too readily
<BR>
by many MDs, but that simply indicates a need for better prescribing
<BR>
algorithms.  Prozac is the tool, the craftsman needs to use it properly.
