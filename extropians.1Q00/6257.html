This is not entirely astonishing, but the report offers an interesting

<P>The genetics of aging: New study says cell division errors may be the common
<BR>
link
<BR>
<P>La Jolla CA., March 31, 2000 -- Gradual genetic changes may be the source of
<BR>
many, if not all illnesses of aging, including breast cancer, osteoporosis,
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. A new study by scientists in The Skaggs
<BR>
Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in La
<BR>
Jolla and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation,
<BR>
published in the latest issue of Science, concludes that human aging and its
<BR>
associated diseases and conditions can be traced to a gradual increase in
<BR>
cell division errors in tissues throughout the body. This functional change
<BR>
begins slowly in middle age and increases gradually with advancing age.
<BR>
<P>According to Richard A. Lerner, M.D., an author of the paper, &quot;Mitotic
<BR>
Misregulation and Human Aging,&quot; &quot;This represents a radical change in the way
<BR>
people have thought about aging. While scientists have believed that aging is
<BR>
a disease in which cells stop dividing, this study suggests that aging is
<BR>
really a disease of quality control. In this case the manufactured product is
<BR>
a new cell. As we get older, altered gene expression results in cells with
<BR>
diminished function.&quot; [etc]
