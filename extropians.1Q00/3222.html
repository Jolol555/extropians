<EM>&gt; Extropes,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was housesitting a friends golden retrievers last night, channel surfing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their tv (away from my usual net surfing mode of entertainment) when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caught an exceedingly brief glimpse of what seemed to be a plug for a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie with extropian content.  Clip of leading man--Patrick somebody or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other I think--peering into a row of laboratory mouse cages, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voice-over mentions that the premise of the old movie, &quot;Flowers for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Algernon&quot;--technologically mediated intelligence enhancement--is rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming a reality.  This was followed by a real world, frontal-interview
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shot of the actor closing with the cliche about whether we will handle this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new capability wisely or poorly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Details, please.  Who knows more about this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Flowers for Algernon was required reading in my junior highschool english
<BR>
literature class. The story involves a mouse and a retarded man. An experiment
<BR>
designed to enhance intelligence is used on the mouse with good results. Before
<BR>
the consequences are thoroughly understood it is tried on a retarded janitor. He
<BR>
becomes a genius straving for knowedge and learns a great deal. Soon, however,
<BR>
the mouse dies, hence the title, but before dying the enhancement reverses. The
<BR>
story turns tragic as the man learns he will slowing lose all he has gained and
<BR>
now has so much appreciation for. The irony is played upon that he would have
<BR>
been blissfully ignorant to his new found loss if he'd been left alone. Is it
<BR>
better to know and lose or never know at all? This is the point of the story.
<BR>
Beware the original played by Cliff Robertson was a tear jerker. I can't say
<BR>
much about the 2000 version until  I watch it in little over an hour from now.
<BR>
It airs on CBS at 9pm PST. I hope this helps.
