Subject: OWL: Reductionism, Determinism and A Priori Metaphysics
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Here is a little note I sent a few months ago to the Journal of
</EM><BR>
Consciousness
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Studies Online discussion group about the relation of naturalism (the view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is no a priori knowledge and that science is the
</EM><BR>
knowledge-gathering
<BR>
<EM>&gt; enterprise par excellence) and determinism. I've long thought the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determinist to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be in the grip of a picture of what science is that has no firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actual science. In any case, I hope somebody finds the following
</EM><BR>
interesting.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- Will W.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -----------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For some time now, I've found debates on free-will and determinism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat hard to follow. My main difficulty has to do with separating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the naturalist rhetoric from what a naturalist really ought to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain. Most of us, I suspect, agree that whatever happens is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect of some cause, and that all causes have some basis in physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality. But the correct naturalist notion of causality is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously deterministic. Physics surely isn't obviously deterministic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I think the specific difficulty in making sense of fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical causality simply brings out the general difficulty in making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense of causality as such.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It offends against a naturalistic epistemological sensibility to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assert, prior to inquiry, that fundamental physical causality *must*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be deterministic. The naturalist gets out of the armchair and looks to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see what assumptions about causality *are* embedded in seemingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successful scientific practice. And when one goes and looks, one finds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that some sciences make deterministic assumptions and others make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emergentist assumptions about sui generis causal powers. This fact is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly exasperating to those who hope steadfastly for the unity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science. One may always choose in the face of exasperation to abandon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's naturalism and offer up transcendental arguments to the effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that science *must* be a unity, because scientific explanations *must*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be causal and causal explanations *must* be reductive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deterministic. (So non-deterministic scientists, lacking a priori
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophical acumen, are just deeply confused.) But these arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will carry very little weight when it appears that knowledge is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gathered despite violating these a priori strictures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, because science itself is not monolithically committed to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular conception of causality, one cannot effectively use science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a bludgeon in debates about free-will. I really don't think it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *scientific* theory that there is no agent causality (that agents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never relata in causal relations), and that thus agents are never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimately responsible for what they do. It is an a priori
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *metaphysical* theory about what causality *has* to be. And if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument for that theory is built on such a priori metaphysical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grounds, there remains much to say against it (besides the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is nothing to be known a priori).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For one, determinism makes hash of convictions about possibility and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessity which, I believe, are well confirmed by successful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commonsense and scientific practice. Additionally, psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence supports the Reidian thesis that we form causal concepts by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attending to our own powers as agents, and then revise, bit by bit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our conception of causality to better suit non-conscious beings. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is how we *do* form and employ causal concepts, one may wonder if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we *ought* to do it that way. Perhaps if one could provide a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deterministic causal story for the way we form agent-causal concepts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then one could plausibly argue that agent causality is a ladder that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ought to be thrown away once climbed. But I do not see any such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deterministic story on the horizon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, I find myself somewhat stupefied by those who move from naturalism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to determinism in the same breath, as if there was a well understood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intimate connection between the two notions.
