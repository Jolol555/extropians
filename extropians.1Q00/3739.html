<EM>&gt; These people are deliberately avoiding all mention of diamondoid and

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't trust them.

<P>Judging from the response I got from the NSF spokesperson and his
<BR>
assistant at the Foresight Conference last year (when I suggested the
<BR>
time required to build nanotech aircraft carriers was 2-3 days),
<BR>
they just simply &quot;don't believe it&quot;.  Most of the NSF folks do not
<BR>
have a biotech background so they don't know what self-replicating,
<BR>
self-assembling machines can really do (NIH funded groups on the
<BR>
other hand just might &quot;get&quot; it).
<BR>
<P>They kind of believe it in the sense of &quot;oh, yes, well maybe someday&quot;
<BR>
but they can't make the mental leap from &quot;nanotech&quot; to self-replicating
<BR>
machines.  This makes some sense in terms of these people are on the
<BR>
edge -- they have to read the grant proposals and separate the doable
<BR>
from the fantasy.  Is their job to fund the &quot;not completely improbable&quot;
<BR>
research (i.e. next 3-5 years).  Anything beyond that they really don't
<BR>
consider.
<BR>
<P>Their perspective would be accurate if diamondoid nanoassembly proves
<BR>
very difficult or designs at the atomic level prove very difficult.
<BR>
So, when going to Congress for money, its better to focus on the
<BR>
&quot;doable&quot;.  Much better to fund research on biotech-derived molecular
<BR>
motors or buckytubes or nano-composites or nanolithography (things that
<BR>
already exist) than to go after the gold rings on the merry-go-round.
<BR>
<P>You have to realize that *most* people in government, research, etc.
<BR>
are *highly* conservative.  I suspect their mental mindsets do not
<BR>
let them entertain paradigms that would grossly upset their world-view.
<BR>
Really now, do you think the government would actually fund a technology
<BR>
that would eliminate revenue sources for the government and perhaps the
<BR>
government itself (if all the people &quot;leave&quot;) if it knew that would be
<BR>
the ultimate result?!?
<BR>
<P>A few people may be clued in but I have to believe most are pretty clueless.
