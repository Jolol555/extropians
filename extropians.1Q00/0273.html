<P>&lt;&lt; Some opposition may be smart, and correct.

&nbsp;It seems highly unwise to assume that all those who disagree with us
<BR>
&nbsp;are stupid or evil.  Until we have perfect knowledge of the universe,
<BR>
&nbsp;the possibility of our own error must always be considered.

<P><P>This is an extremely important point.  Even when we think ourselves most 
<BR>
right, we must always examine the possibility of being wrong.  I think this 
<BR>
is as important a use of an &quot;Opposition to Transhumanism&quot; list as any attempt 
<BR>
to champion transhumanism.  We must listen to our opponents, and always test 
<BR>
whether we or they (or both or neither) know the truth.  Now, having said 
<BR>
that, I suspect that certain elements of transhumanism will continue to hold 
<BR>
up as well as they have in recent years.
