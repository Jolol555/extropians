<P><EM>    &gt;I think it is likely that most injuries, including trauma, ischemic and freezing
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;injury, will involve some loss  of information.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll only talk about freezing in this post and I'll grant you things would be hopeless
<BR>
if the freezing process brought on turbulence. That would mean that tiny changes
<BR>
in initial conditions would lead to huge changes in the outcome, it would mean that
<BR>
two points arbitrarily close together before the freezing could be far apart after,
<BR>
it would mean loss of information making recovery impossible.This probably
<BR>
doesn't happen so things are not completely hopeless, only almost hopeless.
<BR>
<P>Chaotic turbulent flow sets in when a system has a Reynolds number that is
<BR>
larger than about 2000, although you might get some non chaotic vortices if it
<BR>
is bigger than 30. We can find the approximate Reynolds number by using the
<BR>
formula RDV/N. R is the characteristic size of the volume we're interested in,
<BR>
we're interested in cells so R is about 10^-6 meter. D is the density of water
<BR>
10^3 kilograms/cubic meter. V is the velocity of the flow, during freezing it's
<BR>
probably less than 10^-3 meters per second but let's be conservative, I'll give
<BR>
you 3 orders of magnitude and call V 1 meter per second. N is the viscosity of
<BR>
water, at room temperature N is 0.001 newton-second/meter^2, it would be less
<BR>
than that when thing get cold and even less when water is mixed with glycerol
<BR>
as it is in cryonics but let's be conservative again and ignore those factors.
<BR>
If you plug these numbers into the formula you get a Reynolds number of about 1.
<BR>
1 is a lot less than 2000 so it looks like any mixing caused by freezing
<BR>
would probably be laminar not turbulent.

<EM>&gt; The unanswered question is whether this information loss is sufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to obliterate personality, memory, and other important brain state.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think we know enough at this time to give any sort of definitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer to this question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was my objection to the Ralph Merkle essay mentioned a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weeks ago; I thought he was excessively optimistic in claiming that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer was largely known.  But other people who have actually looked at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frozen brains, including Eugene and cryonics &quot;godfather&quot; Mike Darwin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to have a more pessimistic view.
