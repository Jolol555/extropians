<P><P>&nbsp;If two people agree to an exchange where 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cash changes hands, then presumably its an even trade, i.e. no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital gain is realized. If this is so, how can it be taxed?

<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey

<P><P>A dealer or trader who operates as a sole proprietorship business files
<BR>
Form 1040 Schedule C and reports his gross cash income from exchanges
<BR>
during the year, and deducts the cash cost of goods and qualified
<BR>
business expenses, and reports the fair market value of his trade goods
<BR>
inventory as of the end of each year.  It makes little difference whether
<BR>
he does cash deals or strictly barter; either way the net profit will
<BR>
show up on Schedule C.
<BR>
<P><P>Suppose you start the year with a pig worth $50 (fair mkt value you
<BR>
reported) and no cash.  The pig is your inventory and it has a fair
<BR>
market value of $50. You trade the pig for a horse.  At this point it
<BR>
doesn't matter tax-wise what the horse is worth, to you, or to anyone
<BR>
else.  Then you trade the horse for a saddle.  Again, at this point it
<BR>
doesn't matter tax-wise what the saddle is worth, to you, or to anyone
<BR>
else.  You trade the saddle for a cow.   You trade the cow for a
<BR>
motorcycle.  You trade the motorcycle for a car.  Then you trade the car
<BR>
for another car, and the tax year has ended.  You still have no cash, you
<BR>
do not have the pig you started with, but you do have a car.  The car is
<BR>
your inventory.  Say it has a fair market value of $1,000.  That is your
<BR>
end of year inventory value.  There has been no cash income and no cash
<BR>
expenses or cash cost of goods, so the net Schedule C income for the year
<BR>
is $1000 - $50 = $950. 
<BR>
<P><P>An investor reports sales and exchanges of capital assets on Form 1040
<BR>
Schedule D.  For each sale or exchange, the gross cash proceeds of the
<BR>
sale, or the fair market value of the item received in exchange is
<BR>
reported, along with the cost basis of the item sold or exchanged away. 
<BR>
The difference is the capital gain or loss for that transaction.  There
<BR>
are special rules for exchanging 'like kind' capital assets.  For
<BR>
exchanges of 'like kind' property, only the cash portion of the trade, if
<BR>
any cash is involved, is taxable (to its recipient) for that year.  An
<BR>
example is the 'Starker Exchange' rule for investment real estate.  For
<BR>
personal use real estate, using a 'like kind' rule, two house owners
<BR>
should be able to trade houses without reporting a capital gain
<BR>
(assuming, for simplicity, no cash or what they call 'taxable boot' is
<BR>
involved).  At some later time, when the house is sold for cash, or
<BR>
traded for non-'like kind' property, there might be a recognized capital
<BR>
gain.
