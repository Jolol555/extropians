<P><EM>&gt; Oh boy, since we can't seem to stop playing with this subject, Jeff
</EM><BR>
reminds
<BR>
<EM>&gt; me of a children's cartoon show about pirates in England years ago. It too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a character called Master Bates. But that wasn't enough. Oh no. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also had a character named &quot;Seaman Staines&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's hard to imagine writers getting away with that these days. Or could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they really be so innocent?!
</EM><BR>
<P>The villains on the Batman TV show (the cheesy one, with Adam West),
<BR>
frequently derived their names from swear words in archaic languages.
<BR>
Scholars of Ancient Aramaic and so forth would write in and say how much
<BR>
they enjoyed the joke, and the censors got wind of it and made them stop.
