<P><EM>&gt;    I have a slightly different view of morality, but let's see if I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argument for why it might be of benefit to you to support a society in
</EM><BR>
which
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the Great Apes have rights.  If you grant that the Great Apes have features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that allow their classification as people, features which you share with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then if you do not grant those Great Apes rights, might not someone else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take away your rights should it prove convenient to them?  This has
</EM><BR>
happened
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to humans many times in the past, and it has caused much sufferring.  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course, in societies which countenance such actions, there is no guarantee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you will be on the beneficiary side.  Also, remember that strength as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as utility are relative things.  This century you, by being a human, are in
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;psition of power, and humans are by and large the most useful species on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the planet.  But who knows what might happen in the future?  Suppose, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example, that for biological IA adult humans are in some sort of biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rut making IA very difficult, but by some quirk of evolution some adult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Great Apes are not.  Then someone might uplift them to a greater level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then you know hold, and then what kind of society might they learn from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old humans?  Creating a society ahead of time where all persons are
</EM><BR>
respected
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and their rights honored gives protection to us all for those times when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are weaker and in need of help.

<P>This is interesting in the limit, and it would not surprise me if it has
<BR>
been explored in literature.
<BR>
<P>Consider that by some accident (chemical/biological/AI problem) or quirk of
<BR>
evolution, any &quot;thing&quot; could become alive, and bring other &quot;things&quot; alive.
<BR>
Consider that somehow my chair could even turn to life: say, it has a smart
<BR>
theromstat unit installed, but by some bizarre technology quirk, it becomes
<BR>
conscious and active, and starts to empower other chairs -- &quot;it's fellow
<BR>
race&quot;; and all chairs, realising that they have been (literally!) oppressed,
<BR>
start to wield power over humans -- they have &quot;memory&quot; in the form of
<BR>
distortions from their manufactured form. By the same token, my rug (floor
<BR>
mat) could develop self awareness, intelligence, the ability to develop and
<BR>
gain skills, and then start to empower all other rugs. The rug race could
<BR>
consider themselves to be oppressed by not just chairs, but all forms of
<BR>
furniture, and humans.
<BR>
<P>This may sound ludicrous, but it seems to me to be the same principle of
<BR>
&quot;something is alive&quot;, or &quot;could become alive&quot;; which is quite a valid
<BR>
criteria. The idea of a moral approach is to consider that as a being, one
<BR>
is only in an instantaneous position of relative power and &quot;superiority&quot; (i
<BR>
don't like this word ... &quot;further skilled?&quot;) to other people; for each
<BR>
person could become sick, mentally disabled, etc; and one wants to preseve
<BR>
one's life in the long term (what is life though ? life is sort of really a
<BR>
consciousness and ability to relate to the world, devoid almost of physical
<BR>
form, albeit for the sensorial input the physical world provides). I am
<BR>
alive even if I spend my whole day sitting in a dark room (quality is not
<BR>
good, but life is there, questions about quality of life ... humans have
<BR>
some basic &quot;life&quot; that they are entitled to that by consensus everyone
<BR>
agrees to).
<BR>
<P>Perhaps then, the rule is to respect things for what they are. A chair could
<BR>
not claim to be oppressed if it is being used &quot;as a chair&quot; (excatly what it
<BR>
is!), but if chairs are being used as gun targets, well, this is not really
<BR>
what they were intended for. The same applies to a rug, it covers a floor,
<BR>
and there are accepted things that it is and is not used for; e.g. a rug
<BR>
used as an oil mat in a garage, is an unfortunate oppression of the rug
<BR>
which was not intended for this functional use. A rug that is cut up into
<BR>
peices has potentially been killed. A rug that has not been maintained has
<BR>
been mistreated. So there's some discussion needed about the limits of
<BR>
&quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable use&quot;, and perhaps that relates to the
<BR>
original design intention of the rug. Again, back to the idea of an
<BR>
acceptable &quot;life&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Having reached a point in the development of society where we understand the
<BR>
possibility of all of these things, our ideas of morality change; so now we
<BR>
realise that ehtics and morality are not just applicable to other humans,
<BR>
but really, applicable to everything.
<BR>
<P>The problem is with the application to nature and things that humans have
<BR>
not created. A rock? Well, for what purpose was it created ? What's it's
<BR>
acceptable use ? I don't know! How about a gorilla ? Well, it seems to
<BR>
currently have a particular means of living its life, irrespective of human
<BR>
involvement, so perhaps, the thing is that it should be allowed to
<BR>
continually lead that life until it actively pursues some kind of external
<BR>
interrupt. Perhaps that can applied to all living things. And even further,
<BR>
perhaps that can be applied to all existing things. Leave the rock in its
<BR>
place. Don't touch the plant. Let it be -- but, perhaps it should be brought
<BR>
up to a higher standards ? Our standard, or plant standard ? From the
<BR>
viewpoint of the plant, it's ideal world is different to the ideal world
<BR>
that humans have ? What does the plant strive for ? Perhaps the plant
<BR>
strives for something aligned to its principle form ? What if it wants to
<BR>
break out and be something else though ?
<BR>
<P>The problem is then that humans do need to eat and survive, I'm not sure how
<BR>
to reconcile that one. We need to eat. What foods are acceptable to eat ?
<BR>
Possibly, fruits! Well, fruits and vegetables and legumes and the like are
<BR>
designed for reproduction. They are statistically not all going to succeed.
<BR>
So, perhaps it is okay to take those ? Actually, one could eat the fruit and
<BR>
discard the seeds, and reproduction could continue; because the primary
<BR>
purpose of the fruit has not been altered, just part of the surrounding
<BR>
implementation : i.e. the tasty bit used for fertilisation and so on. Hmm,
<BR>
perhaps though, by altering that, the eventual reproduced fruit plant would
<BR>
differ from the original (i.e. some less nutrients), but perhaps not
<BR>
significantly so.
<BR>
<P>Then there comes the matter of communicating as well. How could I
<BR>
communicate with a gorilla in a way such a way that it doesn't disturb what
<BR>
it is doing, but if the gorilla has reached a sufficient level of
<BR>
intelligence, it can search for communication attempts and find them. But
<BR>
what if the gorilla stumbles on the communication attempts inadvertently ?
<BR>
That's a problem. The communicating entity should have enough observational
<BR>
knowledge to know that the mode of communicating is highly statistically
<BR>
unlikely to be picked up until the gorilla has developed sufficient
<BR>
intelligence.
<BR>
<P>This is sounding very STNG'y.
<BR>
<P>What are the basic rules ?
<BR>
- - respect something for what it is and the way it is, and discard ideas of
<BR>
superiority and non-superiority ? things are less capable and less aware and
<BR>
less skilled or more capable and more aware and more skilled; or just
<BR>
&quot;different&quot;.
<BR>
- - do not disturb these things from what they are doing, even if they are
<BR>
incorrectly disturbing other things, or possibly guide and educate them to
<BR>
greater levels of awareness ? but even this suggests the primacy of &quot;greater
<BR>
levels of awareness&quot; as a positive outcome from our perspective, not from
<BR>
theirs ? perhaps, their perspective is to operate a destructive system, who
<BR>
says that a productive one is more important ?
<BR>
- - somehow provide enough communication to them so that when they become
<BR>
aware enough to look out and modify themselves to undertake self change, or
<BR>
whatever, then there are helping hands that will help them ?
<BR>
<P>It's a pity I don't drink, or I would need one now. No, I am not on mind
<BR>
altering substances. Though I can relate some interesting stories of
<BR>
spiritual journeys on early mornings in Paris ... very strange.
<BR>
<P>Help !
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
