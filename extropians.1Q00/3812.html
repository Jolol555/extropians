<EM>&gt; I truly dream about owning a Moller aircar.  I want to be FREE to go where I

<EM>&gt; want, compared to how things are now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem: freedom to travel is less important than the ability to travel to
<BR>
freedom.
<BR>
<P>That is to say: if you get in a car or a plane or a ship or a train today
<BR>
you are prone to invasive policing. From the near-anonymity of the rail
<BR>
ticket (paid cash, no searches, no hassle other than being expected to
<BR>
produce a ticket on demand by a ticket inspector) to the body-searches
<BR>
you get at airports and the external traffic cops you get on the highways
<BR>
demanding that you piss in a bottle, it's merely a matter of degree.
<BR>
<P>Yes, the skycar is cool -- but I'd rather have a system with no travel
<BR>
permits and no coercion and no more policing or monitoring than whatever
<BR>
minimum is necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; airline ticket prices or LONG drives in a car.  Just as alot of young people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now can't imagine a world without the internet, I bet twenty years from now 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many won't be able to imagine things without an aircar in just about every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; garage.
</EM><BR>
<P>NB: I've seen the fuel consumption for the Moller skycar and I am _not_
<BR>
impressed. Assuming the fuel costs as much as for a domestic car here in
<BR>
the UK, it would cost me £120 to fly my skycar from here (Edinburgh) to
<BR>
London -- compared to the £30-60 cost of a budget airline, £50-70 cost of
<BR>
fuel for a car, £30-50 cost of a railway ticket, and £20-30 cost of a coach
<BR>
ticket. It may make sense in the USA -- big empty skies and cheap fuel --
<BR>
but there are places where it'd be more trouble than it's worth.
<BR>
<P>What I want -- here in the UK -- is a means of surface transport that's as
<BR>
energy-efficient as a bicycle (read: equivalent gasoline mileage measured
<BR>
in thousands of miles per gallon), but safer, faster, protected from the
<BR>
elements, uses a motor instead of a human being for power, and is just
<BR>
as convenient (i.e. no expensive licensing requirements, can be stored
<BR>
indoors or parked anywhere, just hop on and ride). Add high-speed public
<BR>
transport hubs within a half-hour's journey (300mph TGV's maintained
<BR>
to Dutch standards for preference), and the ability to buy a ticket for
<BR>
cash without any sort of intrusive surveillance or advanced booking, plus
<BR>
optional private cabins if you're willing to pay extra, and I'll be happy.
