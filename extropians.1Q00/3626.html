While I'm as ready to condemn &quot;PC-ness&quot; as the next person and DO think that 
<BR>
the THEORY of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; has had a bad effect on education 
<BR>
POLICY, I believe there is a valuable kernel of truth upon which the basic 
<BR>
idea is based and that the PRACTICE of &quot;teaching to a person's strengths&quot; is 
<BR>
good.  I know that this is what Nadia is talking about and believe that 
<BR>
whatever &quot;debate&quot; is going on here is really folks talking past each other.
<BR>
<P>My opinion on this is based to a great extent on my own personal experience.  
<BR>
I have a very uneven distribution of mental talents.  I've always scored off 
<BR>
the scale (on the good side :-) in visualization and verbal skills, but am 
<BR>
basically a mathematical moron.  Thus I tend to translate almost all 
<BR>
intellectual problems into complimentary geometric and categorical terms.  
<BR>
When I teach on insurance commercial and legal issues I draw a 3-D &quot;risk 
<BR>
space&quot; model I've developed and always have to check and see if my audience 
<BR>
is keeping up with me, since I can naturally and intuitively visualize 
<BR>
concepts with this model and often spin off into discussions of how certain 
<BR>
issues require a few more dimensions to resolve properly.  On the other hand, 
<BR>
when I encounter the same material in purely numerical terms, I often find 
<BR>
myself completely lost, even though many of the core issues are ones I've 
<BR>
been considered an &quot;expert&quot; in for almost two decades.  I've encountered 
<BR>
people who have different basic mental architecture who underestimate my 
<BR>
abilities as a lawyer when they see me &quot;drawing little pictures&quot; to work on a 
<BR>
legal issue, only to get their butts kicked when my strategic initiative 
<BR>
comes out of a 5-dimensional vector they didn't &quot;see&quot; coming.
