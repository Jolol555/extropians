Particularly striking is the volume of extraordinarily thoughtful, 
<BR>
expositionally lucid, coherent articles he posts. On another list, I 
<BR>
recently called him Robert &quot;Jupiter Brain&quot; Owen to highlight one of the 
<BR>
hypotheses I have to explain the super-human cognition that seems to be 
<BR>
required for his output. (The other: that there are several people who 
<BR>
agreed to work together under one name, to create the impression of a person 
<BR>
of super-human capacity.)

<P>Robert is a brilliant fellow to be sure.  I have to often reread his posts 
<BR>
and go for the dictionary.  He has humanity along with a good mind which is 
<BR>
why I am fond of him.  I just wonder what the Orion Institute is about?  He 
<BR>
has never said as far as I know.
<BR>
<P>I like the idea of several people working together under one name to create 
<BR>
the impression of a superhuman intellect.  I had the idea I could gather 
<BR>
some of my brighter friends at school based on majors (bio, computer sci, 
<BR>
chem, engineering, english lit., etc.) and we could be a one of these 
<BR>
&quot;communal superminds!&quot;  But then I thought that based on what I have seen of 
<BR>
papers written by committee we would wind up taking forever to get done and 
<BR>
in the end have posts that would be torture to read.
