<P>
Yesterday we had a wonderful course in writing and media here at STHF,
<BR>
which of course ended up with a gaggle of transhumanists discussing
<BR>
interesting subjects far, far into the night. One idea a friend
<BR>
suggested seems related to this thread:
<BR>
<P>Assuming sufficient neurotechnology, he wanted to experience all the
<BR>
different levels of pain. After all, how does having an arm ripped off
<BR>
or being crucified really feel? With neurotech you could experience it
<BR>
with no lasting ill effects, and it might be an useful experience to
<BR>
really know how bad pain could be to get a good perspective on
<BR>
life. Of course, having a VR experience of being crucified and knowing
<BR>
that it is all just a simulation would remove some of the sting, so
<BR>
ideally the simulation would also temporarily erase the awareness of
<BR>
this being a simulation. 
<BR>
<P>This of course raises some moral questions, like if your present self
<BR>
has the right to create a future self in great pain and no way of
<BR>
avoiding it (my answer would be that it is OK - potential people have
<BR>
no rights), or if it would be moral for somebody else to end the pain
<BR>
as the agonised future self most likely would want (this is trickier;
<BR>
it goes against the self determination of the original version, but
<BR>
the simulation-modified self is also a person who has rights; since
<BR>
the original does not exist for the moment helping the agonized self
<BR>
if it wants too is right, but as soon as it reverts to the
<BR>
pre-simulation state it might decide to continue the exercise
<BR>
anyway). There are also some learning problems, since intense pain can
<BR>
cause excess levels of neurotransmittors enhancing memory and hence
<BR>
laying the ground for unwanted side effects such as PTSD, but this can
<BR>
likely be moderated by neurotech.
<BR>
<P>I did a quick order-of-magnitude calculation of the number of
<BR>
different pain stimuli that were possible. If we assume one million
<BR>
pain receptors active at ten different rates, then we can get 10^10^6
<BR>
possible pain-configurations. Experiencing them all would take nearly
<BR>
forever (and be a very good approximation of hell - a combination of
<BR>
pain and boredom), so one has to be selective in what experiences to
<BR>
experience since most are utterly alike and uninteresting. 
<BR>
<P>Maybe this kind of extreme experience cognitive engineering is going
<BR>
to be a popular thing among the posthumans? A kind of dare, passage
<BR>
rite/education or just entertainment? Of course, pain is just one
<BR>
possible dimension to experience, one can do the same for pleasure.
<BR>
