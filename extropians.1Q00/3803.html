<P>
Some of the discussion between Eugene and Jim have got me
<BR>
to thinking...
<BR>
<P>... Off in the distance, the Japanese vistors furiously begin
<BR>
to snap photos as the 60 meter, 10,000 ton gears of the Bradbury
<BR>
Mind slowly begin to rotate, spewing out a cloud of idea dust....
<BR>
Godzilla was fiction, but this is *real*...
<BR>
<P>Now, lets assume that nanobot enabled freezing damage repair
<BR>
is imperfect.  But lets assume that they repair process can
<BR>
produce a *functional* breathing human being (that seems
<BR>
pretty doable, even if you have to regenerate every neuron).
<BR>
So the real question is how much of your &quot;mind&quot; is left after
<BR>
the reanimation process?  Presumably there could be states
<BR>
that lie between complete reanimation (i.e. memories intact)
<BR>
and clean-slate reanimation (functional w/o memories).
<BR>
<P>The question becomes, *what* could people do while they
<BR>
are still alive to assist your reanimated self to be &quot;reborn&quot;.
<BR>
These have a wide range.  They include NMR scans of the neural
<BR>
activity of the brain -- e.g. Doctor says &quot;Think about ice cream&quot;,
<BR>
scan, &quot;Think about love&quot;, scan, &quot;Think about snakes&quot;, scan, etc.
<BR>
These images of mental activity could provide &quot;clues&quot; as to how the
<BR>
nanobots should re-wire things (so your reanimated neural activity
<BR>
matches your pre-cryo activity).  At the non-medical level, there
<BR>
are presumably many things you could do to provide information to
<BR>
oneself about who you &quot;were&quot;.  (Financial records, diaries, etc.)
<BR>
Now, if you only get partial functional reanimation these &quot;hints&quot;
<BR>
could prove very useful for recovering or restablishing those
<BR>
connections that produce a satisfactory reflection of ones former self.
<BR>
<P>So, lets assume reanimation is imperfect -- What can we do to augment
<BR>
the process and what are the relative costs and benefits?
<BR>
<P>And now the $20 question -- how many people would be happy without
<BR>
any direct &quot;recall&quot; of their former selves, but only a warm and fuzzy
<BR>
&quot;recognition&quot; (deja vu) feeling, of &quot;yes, that was me&quot;?  Or would it be
<BR>
ok if you &quot;know&quot; your stories because you read about them (in your diary)
<BR>
but you don't actually &quot;remember&quot; them.  Finally, would you be unhappy
<BR>
if the nanobots can't &quot;recover&quot; things and so they engineer in either
<BR>
the &quot;memories&quot; or &quot;recognition&quot; based on your pre-suspension recordings.
<BR>
<P>I think these questions are quite significant, because in the reanimation
<BR>
era, who you are could quite probably be &quot;synthesized&quot;.  I believe too
<BR>
few people are specifying the detailed conditions under which they wish
<BR>
to be recovered (do these things, but don't do those...).
<BR>
<P>Anders might want to comment on individuals who undergo similar
<BR>
disconnects due to mental illness or trauma that could be representative
<BR>
of the types of losses that might occur during freezing/reanimation.
<BR>
<P>Who are we anyway???
<BR>
<P>Robert
