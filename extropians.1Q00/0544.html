</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wow.. I know that band! 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find it interesting that this is the only reference to the &quot;Prog Rock&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movement I have ever seen on the list (except once when I made a reference to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Roger Dean). Most futurists seem to be into techno and electronic music, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which, while utilizing the latest electronic technology, doesn't employ 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced harmonies or melodies. It is a wonderful form, but it's like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful graphics computers creating fractals and random A-life... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I think of &quot;Extropic&quot; in terms of the arts, I think of cleverness, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced thinking, architecture and structure ... mixing with the latest 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies too ---    &quot;creating order out of chaos&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Progressive Rock went out of style - but so did *listening* to music, and so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did playing instruments! ; - )
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I've been exposed to a lot of Prog Rock (I have a couple friends who live
<BR>
for it), but I must admit that I really don't get it.  I think there must
<BR>
be a generational culture component.  For me it comes across as,
<BR>
well... aimless(?), for lack of a better word.  Like it is being different
<BR>
for the sake of being different rather than working towards any
<BR>
particular goal.  Of course, I strongly suspect that these are perceptual
<BR>
differences.
<BR>
<P>However, I do find it interesting that you describe it as &quot;Extropic&quot;
<BR>
compared to &quot;4-on-the-floor&quot; electronica, as I would think that the
<BR>
excessive structure of essentially all techno would contain less entropy
<BR>
by the definition of the word.  I think your complaint with respect to
<BR>
most techno is that it doesn't contain *enough* entropy.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; In the case of techno music, you are presented with repetitive chaos and your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind (some suggest with the help of chemical brain stimulation) creates it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own order...great to dance to. And other things ... but perhaps I am not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listening to the right techno... 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Heh!  &quot;Repetitive chaos&quot;.  It will take me second to digest that one.
<BR>
<P>You are right about one thing, though, and that is that the vast, vast
<BR>
majority of &quot;techno&quot; is not particularly stimulating.  Most of the fairly
<BR>
brilliant work in the genre seems to be largely composed of
<BR>
one-album artists (e.g. Eon &quot;Void Dweller&quot; circa '92) who disappear as
<BR>
rapidly as they appeared or artists who produce one exceptional album
<BR>
followed by mostly crap (e.g. Speedy J &quot;G Spot&quot; circa '95).  This
<BR>
seems to be a pretty common pattern.  There *are* some electronica artists
<BR>
that have produced consistently excellent music over many years and many
<BR>
albums (e.g. Orbital), but these are quite rare and most do not fall into
<BR>
the strict &quot;techno&quot; genre.  I am looking at my CD rack as I write this, and
<BR>
there are very few artists that have produced multiple albums that I would
<BR>
consider brilliant.  A perishingly small number, in fact, and a
<BR>
signficant percentage of those I wouldn't really classify as electronica
<BR>
anyway.  
<BR>
<P>You are right about DJ Spooky below.  He is plagued with the same problem
<BR>
as most in the genre.  After producing an album with some excellent cuts
<BR>
(&quot;Gargantuan&quot; circa '93) he quickly slipped into mediocrity (IMO) trying
<BR>
to change the flavor of his music.
<BR>
<P>I have a couple theories in this regard.  Many genres of electronica are
<BR>
not heavily supported by the music industry and tend to be fringe
<BR>
interests of artistically inclined individuals.  This allows a great deal
<BR>
of creativity as there is not a huge pressure to conform.  However, once
<BR>
one of these artists produces a critical acclaimed work that makes their
<BR>
personal style stand out, I get the impression that many of them try to
<BR>
re-invent themselves as the quintessential artiste in an attempt to
<BR>
maintain some sort of image of being &quot;avante garde&quot; in the face of a hoard
<BR>
of copycats.  In practice, a lot of them stray from what made them good in
<BR>
the first place, creating a lapse into mediocrity.  It is far easier to be
<BR>
creative when you feel that you are expected to be creative within
<BR>
well-defined boundaries; it is much harder when the creativity is in
<BR>
defining the boundaries themselves.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Music however, to me, like all the arts, requires intense learning curves and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; literacy, To truly interest me, my mind requires more focused music, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different mental energy than serving up (no matter how enticing and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grooveful) rhythmic repetitions spiked with dubs and clipped buzznotes... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Progressive rock today doesn't get much publicity, and it's too hard for most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to want to learn ... too complicated for a lot of people to want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listen to, but it will go down in history as one of the more important 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developments of music in the 20th Century. Zappa is going to be remember long 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after DJ Spooky is dead...
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I can agree with the sentiment.  Some people might find it interesting
<BR>
that I find J.S. Bach to be a significantly greater musician than Mozart. 
<BR>
Both produced great music, but whereas Mozart seems to have had a gift for
<BR>
producing easy-to-digest likeable music, much of Bach's work (particularly
<BR>
his later stuff) had the carefully calculated depth and design of a true
<BR>
master.  Had Mozart lived longer he may have achieved that level mastery
<BR>
in creating music, but as it stands much of his music appears to be
<BR>
&quot;unintentional&quot; (autistic perhaps?).  I can appreciate that Zappa was a
<BR>
master of his music; I don't particularly like his music, but I do
<BR>
recognize his abilities.
<BR>
<P>But like all the arts, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I come from
<BR>
a musical family and  was classically trained on a couple instruments from
<BR>
a very young age and would consider myself generally quite literate,
<BR>
musically.  Regardless, I still don't &quot;get&quot; prog rock, as I stated above. 
<BR>
At the same time, I find myself very dissatisfied with most of the music I
<BR>
find on store shelves.  As with all times, there are very few masters of
<BR>
the art of music among us, even with the wider accessibility of music
<BR>
making technology.  On the upside, the wide availability of MP3s from
<BR>
unsigned or unknown artists has really been a boon for both musicians and
<BR>
individuals who are looking for music outside the mainstream.  Even five
<BR>
years ago it was virtually impossible to find new artists that I liked,
<BR>
largely because the distribution and exposure simply wasn't there.
