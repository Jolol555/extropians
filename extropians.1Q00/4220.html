<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Christian%20evangelicals%20colliding%20with%20the%20singularity...&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000306191126.86792.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mike@datamann.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The reason why this sort of thing happens is that rational people are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loathe to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delve into theology, which is the memespace that these arguments originate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and so the reactionaries are conceded the originating territory from which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can assail progressive concepts. Activist extropians must first wash out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distaste and take an active part in the theological debate, do no concede 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;territory from the start. With such predecessors as Teilhard des Chardins 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;originated their Omega Point theories completely within the context of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our concepts are not strangers to religion. We need people who have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;training to develop a whole theological basis (in several religions) for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extropic concepts, and get them promoted in both the religious and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mainstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;press. Once this is in place, the reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theological 'high ground', and they will be seen for what they truly are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opressive luddites.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would probably be a decent candidate for this assignment, but I would not 
<BR>
volunteer (and if elected would not serve), simply because I no longer can 
<BR>
morally espouse or attempt to justify irrational beliefs, such as religion.  
<BR>
Any irrational belief system is wholly based on one's subjective world view. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without objective evidence from which to start, any debate on this level 
<BR>
is a time-wasting exercise of &quot;I'm right and you're wrong because I just 
<BR>
know it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Better to leave the theists to their own devices until their mouths begin to 
<BR>
water watching us live in health and wealth for hundreds of years with no 
<BR>
sign from God that he's pissed off about it.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
