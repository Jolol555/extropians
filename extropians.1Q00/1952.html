</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Background on the National Medal of Technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The National Medal of Technology is the nation's highest honor in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;technology.   Enacted by Congress in 1980, the Medal has been awarded by the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;President of the United States each year since 1985.  It is awarded to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;several individuals (and/or groups of individuals) each year.  In most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;years, a company has also been honored.  There are no categories specified
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in the award.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley writes: &quot;The National Medal of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Technology is the Nation's highest honor for technological achievement,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;presented annually by the President of the United States.  The men and women
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;awarded the National Medal of Technology are those whose extraordinary works
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in research, development and design have made significant contributions to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;U.S. prosperity and competitiveness, our overall quality of life, and our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;understanding of the world around us.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;President Clinton, in his remarks at the April 27, 1999 White House ceremony
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bestowing the National Medal of Technology to the 1998 Laureates said &quot;Your
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;success in illuminating the hows and whys of our world and raising the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;quality of human existence have helped make the time in which we live
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;perhaps the most exciting in human history. . . In an age when the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;store of knowledge doubles every five years, where prosperity depends upon
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;command of that ever-growing store, the United States is the strongest it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;has ever been, thanks in large measure to the remarkable pace and scope of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;American Science and technology in the last 50 years. . .&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ray Kurzweil's Brief Biography Released by the White House
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When Ray Kurzweil was developing the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the first
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, he worked closely with a team
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of blind engineers and scientists, not just to test the Kurzweil Reading
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Machine and design its user interface, but on all facets of this complex
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;undertaking. It was a simple but pioneering design philosophy-work closely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with the intended users of one's inventions as key participants in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;invention process. That philosophy combined with Kurzweil's own innovative
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;genius has led to a dazzling array of landmark inventions.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Reading Machine itself has been called the most significant advance for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the blind since the invention of Braille in the nineteenth century.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Introduced in 1976, it reads ordinary printed materials such as books,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;magazines and memos to blind, visually impaired and dyslexic persons in a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;synthesized voice. Its invention required solving several important computer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;science problems and resulted in the creation of the first omni-font optical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;character recognition (OCR) technology, the first CCD (Charge Coupled
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Device) flat-bed scanner and the first text-to-speech synthesizer. Unlike
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;limited-font OCR systems, Kurzweil's OCR recognized print regardless of type
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;style. It would be ten years before anyone else was able to duplicate this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;capability.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Each of these inventions evolved into what is today a major commercial field
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;or industry, and the technologies that Kurzweil created, and their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;successors, continue to be market leaders within those industries. Virtually
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;all American information workers use, at least indirectly, CCD flat-bed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;scanning and omni-font OCR, technologies first created and pioneered by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil. These are key enabling technologies that have made possible text
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and multi-media data bases, on-line information services, image and text
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;documents on the World Wide Web and other manifestations of the information
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;age.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When Kurzweil turned his attention to developing the first computer music
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;keyboard that could accurately and convincingly recreate the sounds of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;grand piano and other orchestral (i.e., acoustic) instruments, he applied
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the same lesson he had learned in developing the reading machine. All the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;engineers and scientists that worked on the new project were musicians, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;many were quite accomplished. The Kurzweil 250, introduced in 1984, was able
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to fool concert pianists in an A-B &quot;blind&quot; comparison as to whether they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were hearing a grand piano or the Kurzweil invention. The technology
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil created allowed musicians for the first time to play the sounds of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;any acoustic instrument, to play them polyphonically (i.e., multiple notes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;at a time), and to apply the full range of computer control techniques such
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as sequencing, layering and sound modification to the rich desirable sounds
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of acoustic instruments. As with the Reading Machine and the OCR technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it would be several years before any other person or organization would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;duplicate this feat..
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The type of computer-based music synthesis that Kurzweil pioneered has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;evolved into what is today a multi-billion dollar industry and is used to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;create virtually all commercial music-recorded albums, movies, TV, etc. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil brand of electronic musical instruments is a market leader and sold
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in 45 countries.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil was also the principal developer of the first commercially marketed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;large vocabulary speech recognition technology. Kurzweil VOICE Report,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;introduced in 1987, could convert speech into print, the opposite of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;reading machine. Today it is widely used by hands-disabled persons to create
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;written documents, use computers, and control their environment. A
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;combination of Kurzweil's speech recognition technology with a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil-developed medical expert system and knowledge base is also widely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;used by physicians to create medical reports.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Overall, Kurzweil's inventions have involved major advances in computer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;science, while at the same time yielding practical products that meet
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fundamental needs. It is rare for one individual to successfully work at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;both ends of this spectrum. He has also created multiple businesses to bring
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;these inventions to market, all of which continue today as market leaders.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;His inventions have provided significant benefit to mankind by overcoming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;major barriers for disabled persons, enriching the world of music, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;expanding the usefulness of computers for everyone.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In addition to his inventions, Kurzweil is a prolific author. His latest
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, When Computers Exceed Human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Intelligence (Viking, 1999), has quickly achieved a high level of critical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and commercial success.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kurzweil received his BS in computer science and literature from MIT.
