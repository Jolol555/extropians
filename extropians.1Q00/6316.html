<P>
I've been working on some rules for a type of paintball I'm calling BORG vs.
<BR>
Extropy. Comments are welcome:
<BR>
<P>BORG vs. Extropian Paintball:
<BR>
<P>This game pits a collective against a group of individualists in a 'high tech'
<BR>
milieu.
<BR>
<P>BORG: As in the classic collectivist high tech organism from Star Trek
<BR>
Extropian: a pro-technology indivdiualist, tending toward anarcho-capitalist or
<BR>
US style libertarianism
<BR>
<P>Because the opponents are drastically different groups, with different cultures,
<BR>
each operates according to its own set of rules that provide their own
<BR>
advantages AND disadvantages.
<BR>
<P>Object of the game: All players in the game become captured by a single side,
<BR>
either borg components or extropians. Once a player has been either assimilated
<BR>
or liberated by the opposing side, and they join the opposing side, they are to
<BR>
act as completely in character of that opposing side as possible. No
<BR>
sandbagging.
<BR>
<P>The BORG: Because the BORG are a collective organism, there will be a central
<BR>
server BORG that can be captured. This server is a BORG who cannot themselves
<BR>
participate in combat. Capture of the server by a single extropian causes from
<BR>
0-100% of all BORG (and ALL extropians who have been previously assimilated by
<BR>
the BORG) components to become liberated from the BORG. Each non-ex-extropian
<BR>
BORG flips a coin to determine release or rentention. Once captured, the server
<BR>
must be released (giving opportunity to capture it again after a given time
<BR>
period). When a BORG is hit by a paintball,  it is 'liberated' to make a choice
<BR>
between individuality and the collective (a coin toss, really)(except the
<BR>
server, which will always choose the collective). If it chooses to return to the
<BR>
collective, and that same BORG is hit again, it is dead and out of the game.
<BR>
BORG wear radios, and transponders, and they must obey all orders of the central
<BR>
server. BORG wear clearly identifiable markings that are common to all BORG.
<BR>
<P>Extropians: Extropians are individualists, so there is no central server, so the
<BR>
BORG cannot assimilate more than one extropian at a time. Extropians carry
<BR>
radios, but no transponders, and no extropian has to obey any order from another
<BR>
extropian. When a BORG hits an extropian, the extropian is assimilated. If that
<BR>
extropian is liberated then captured again, the extropian has the choice to
<BR>
suicide or be assimilated in hopes of being liberated again. Whenever an
<BR>
extropian that has been assimilated is hit by a paintball, it is liberated from
<BR>
the collective. There is a 10% chance that the liberated extropian will want to
<BR>
return to the collective, if they do so, they are not dead if captured again,
<BR>
but do have that 10% chance again. Extropians can wear whatever clothing or
<BR>
disguise they desire. Once the Borg have captured each extropian at least once,
<BR>
it is accepted that the private key of every Extropian has been compromised, and
<BR>
the Collective can then attempt to do a mass assimilation via delivery of a meme
<BR>
bomb, which will automatically assimilate between 1-100% of all extropians via
<BR>
penetration of their email firewalls.
<BR>
<P>I know Anders likes to play these RPG type games... anyone else have any
<BR>
suggestions?
