<P>
There are good chances that spread of Ecstasy in the younger
<BR>
generation made a serious contribution to reduction of crime
<BR>
rates, along with the Row vs. Wade decision that assured reduced
<BR>
influx of unwanted children into the crime force...
<BR>
I believe that a lot more violence is committed against pot
<BR>
smokers in jails than by them outside.  
<BR>
Jails are a school of crime.  If we put all blonds into jails
<BR>
for several years and raped them there, after that being blond
<BR>
would correlate with being criminal (plus avoidance of law).
<BR>
<P>My friend once suggested that if Nazi used Ecstasy (it was
<BR>
discovered in Germany in 1912), the WWII would not have happened.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the government statistics would only list a few people
<BR>
who dehydrated from too much happy dancing and a few people who
<BR>
committed crimes hiding from the govt persecution or getting money
<BR>
to support their habit that was made too expensive by the govt.
<BR>
<P>I find it shocking that most of American population would be
<BR>
considered criminals if the things they do were known - according
<BR>
to the laws they collectively support.  This is no different from
<BR>
any other repressive regime.  Actually, in some that I know, most
<BR>
people actually believed the gov't.  In U.S., they don't.
<BR>
<P>(As an exercise, visit 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.goto.com/d/about/advertisers/othertools.jhtml">http://www.goto.com/d/about/advertisers/othertools.jhtml</A>
<BR>
click on Suggestions list, then type &quot;Russian&quot; in the window -
<BR>
see what people look for).
<BR>
<P>In many cases, prohibition itself creates problems of all
<BR>
kinds, including inability to handle the issues directly,
<BR>
internalized guilt of various sorts in practically everybody,
<BR>
suspicion, hypocrisy, violence, etc. - and these are harder
<BR>
and harder to handle.
<BR>
<P>(I like reminding people that out of millions of animal 
<BR>
species, humans are the only one who have any problem seeing
<BR>
each other naked - and this is entirely the consequence of
<BR>
warped social norms.)
<BR>
<P>The laws contradict each other and don't make any sense.
<BR>
The examples are too numerous to list.
<BR>
<P>So one one hand, we see more and more people using new
<BR>
opportunities in their private lives; on the other, increasing
<BR>
public witch-hunting, even for things that just recently were
<BR>
OK with everybody.
<BR>
<P>This situation should be relieved - or it will explode in near
<BR>
historical future.  And the more we have of illogical repressive
<BR>
laws and the social structures grown to depend on them, the harder
<BR>
it gets.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the current U.S. population would ever *be able*
<BR>
to live in openness in the mildest issues.  They are all so
<BR>
brainwashed and warped they'll have to die without ever seeing
<BR>
freedom.   
<BR>
<P>I'd venture to define violence as depriving people of free choice
<BR>
of their experiences.    U.S. gov't applies violence to everybody
<BR>
- to the extent that people don't even know anymore what they would
<BR>
feel if they were free.
