NBC BOYCOTT GROWS: Seventeen NBC affiliates representing more than 4percent 
<BR>
of the U.S. are now preempting the controversial prime-time cartoon God,the 
<BR>
Devil and Bob, Variety reports. &quot;What's real troubling to me is the 
<BR>
discomfort that people have with their own religion in terms of being afraid 
<BR>
to examine it, open it up,&quot; says executive producer Harvey Myman.

<BR>
<P>Having seen the pilot episode I can say that the irony is that this show 
<BR>
would be found to be quite good and not 'heretical' if people would just 
<BR>
tune in and see for themselves!
<BR>
<P>God, who is in the form of Jerry Garcia, is very laid back but still rather 
<BR>
strict upon closer examination and not too far from the mainstream Christian 
<BR>
view of him!
<BR>
<P>Satan, is a weasily liar and deceiver who will torture and take advantage 
<BR>
whenever the opportunity arises.  God is rather gifted in the show at 
<BR>
putting him in his place!  Part of the shows fun is seeing how this is done.
<BR>
<P>Bob is no Job, that is for sure!  He has a good heart but lives for fun and 
<BR>
is often sorely tempted.  He has a wife and teen daughter that he does love 
<BR>
deeply but is sometimes at a loss on how to deal with them.
<BR>
<P>It's a good show and I recommend it to all of you.  If they keep up the 
<BR>
story quality it will hopefully do well.  Check it out.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
