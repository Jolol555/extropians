<P>
Rather than comment on individual posts, I'll offer some general
<BR>
comments.
<BR>
<P>a) We are genetically pre-wired for a concept of &quot;beauty&quot;.
<BR>
b) Since this is probably a multi-factorial genetic preference,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is probably some Poisson distribution for how strong
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is in different individuals.
<BR>
c) More than likely some people have experiences that will cause
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them to reject their built-in preferences (I for example
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was told in the 4th Grade that I'd get my face rearranged
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I continued an infaturation with a cute blonde girl who was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also liked by one of the class pack leaders.  To this day
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blondes don't do much for me).
<BR>
d) To some degree we rely on &quot;agents&quot; to tailor our tastes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem amazingly susceptible to fashion or entertainment industry
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dictates as to the clothes and people who we consider &quot;beautiful&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect this is an efficiency mechanism.  You get points for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating interesting &quot;looks&quot;.  Failing that, you get points for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being able to buy interesting &quot;looks&quot;.  Failing that, you should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least conform to the predominant &quot;looks&quot;.  Since most of us don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have the expertise or time to do this as a full time profession we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;punt&quot; to the extent that we match how we appear to those around us.
<BR>
e) Uniforms (fitting into the crowd) are alive and well in most
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cultures and sub-cultures.  You don't see many Wall St. investment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bankers running around in Gap chinos and you don't see many SiVal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investment bankers running around in suits (except for closings).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every subculture has a range of what is boring, accepted, creative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and outrageous.
<BR>
f) When we upload you are still going to have the problem of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how you &quot;appear&quot;.  Its just going to be much more flexible.
<BR>
