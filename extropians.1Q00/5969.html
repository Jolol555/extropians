<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a newcomer I have nevertheless been around to read 150 to 200 
<BR>
postings.  Still I am not totally sure I will be on point inre the to-do list 
<BR>
for the next century.  If I fall short please indulge me?  :)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put my understanding of the theme as a question: If I had one 
<BR>
hundred million dollars to spend for a program to benefit mankind over the 
<BR>
next hundred years how would I spend the money?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would use the money to promote an organization somewhat like 
<BR>
this one over the entire face of the globe.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would promote the latest knowledge of health (mental &amp; 
<BR>
physical) and longevity amongst this group.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In The Bell Curve the authors H&amp;M report that the smartest people 
<BR>
regardless of race, religion or other background are congregating.  No doubt 
<BR>
the Internet is having a positive effect on this phenomena.  With the advent 
<BR>
of intelligence increasing techniques many more people will become 
<BR>
exceptionally intelligent.  My effort would be intended to help this process 
<BR>
of congregation along.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, one of the goals of the organization would be to increase the 
<BR>
flow of information among its members.  One of the most important types of 
<BR>
information would be health (mental and physical) longevity.  My reading of 
<BR>
the current state of medicine informs me that our knowledge of longevity is 
<BR>
doubling once every three and a half years.  As an aside; I believe that 
<BR>
particular estimate came from Ronald M. Klatz, MD,  Other sources such as Roy 
<BR>
L. Walford and the new articles about Geron, Inc. convince me that Dr. Klatz 
<BR>
may be about right.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I am trying to produce a society in which many people are 
<BR>
exceptionally intelligent, extraordinarily healthy and routinely living into 
<BR>
three digit ages.  In fact, I have read that the Actuaries say that if we 
<BR>
achieved medical immortality (freedom from disease both infectious and other) 
<BR>
violence would limit our ages to an average of 350 years.   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a society in existence I believe all the other problems become 
<BR>
manageable.
<BR>
