<EM>&gt; What is probably implied by this study is that the more one interacts on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net, the less 'real' or 'in the flesh' interactions with people.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Obvious on the face of it... there are only so many hours in a day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can definitely grow intellectually on the net, particularly among the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian/nano group of people, but emotional sustenance, and your ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychologically interact with family, friends, and others is definitely not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be enhanced by spending lots of time reading and e-mailing on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net.

<P>I'd have to disagree with that, just from personal experience.  I jumped in to
<BR>
the online world about 7-8 years ago.  My first five years were marked by
<BR>
involvement in flame war after flame war.  I had strong opinions and took
<BR>
offense easily (besides which, the average person is DUMB!).  As time went by,
<BR>
however, I started to mature and I learned how to interact with people online
<BR>
(harder than in real life because of less bandwidth and therefore no nonverbal
<BR>
clues as to emotional intent) in a less confrontational manner.
<BR>
<P>I don't do flame wars anymore.  I learned, I grew, I matured.  The lessons
<BR>
learned have translated into the real world as well.  My ability to interact
<BR>
face to face has been enhanced by my online experience.
