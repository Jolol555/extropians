<P>
<EM>&gt;The very fact that you got your answer that way should, of course, suggest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to you that your definition may be rigged.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. You're observing exactly what I pointed out at the end of my post. It's
<BR>
hard to eliminate human alterior motivations from supposed debate. I am
<BR>
interested only in the truth. I'm not a great fan of the way humans conduct
<BR>
themselves, and would like to improve the situation by making at least some
<BR>
proportion of human debate purely reasonable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Here's another definition, which might rig the answers in my favor:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Something exists if it can have causal effects on something else which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exists.  This definition would be incomplete without a few starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;points, so I'll give a couple: I exist. You exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me that your definition is just a more objective version of
<BR>
mine. I stated mine in terms of human perception. You eliminate such
<BR>
subjectivity by using &quot;have causal effects on&quot; rather than &quot;perceive through
<BR>
my senses&quot;. Obviously, entities must have a causal effect on your sensors to
<BR>
be presented to your &quot;self&quot; as a perception.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Anyway, the stronger point is that we can keep on cooking up definitions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each of which will yield some conclusion on the qualia question, but we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have no way of determining which of these definitions we ought to use.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes we do. Debate. The establishment of definitions MUST be the first stage.
<BR>
Otherwise everything following the ambiguous starting point will be unsound.
<BR>
So given your comments above, what do you think debate is? Just a game, a
<BR>
pointless pastime? Of course not. It's an opportunity to show off, get some
<BR>
more brasso for your golden hats. To reap the calming, warm sensation of
<BR>
self respect from the feedback of others, impressed by your use of esoteric
<BR>
vocabulary and poetic rhetoric. Is anyone on this list or elsewhere
<BR>
interested in producing conclusions from debate, to perhaps make our
<BR>
existence more bearable? Probably not. I'm leaving this ostentatious,
<BR>
puerile human reality for good if I don't find soon just ONE other person so
<BR>
mewhere who isn't solely concerned with enhancing their social status to
<BR>
reap the associated short term sensory benefits. So hands up anyone that
<BR>
sees what I'm saying !
<BR>
BTW, I realise I'll get flamed for this, what with the pursuit of
<BR>
self-glorification being such a major consideration in humans. Well, I would
<BR>
have been flamed had I not written these final sentences - you don't get
<BR>
brasso for being perceived as predictable !!
