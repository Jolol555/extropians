<EM>&gt; &gt;There are at least three problems with this.  One, most people know very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little about cryonics anyway.  So, said news report would probably go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unnoticed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you just mentioned &quot;cryonics&quot;, perhaps most people might not know what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mean.. if you gave a brief description of the procedure, I think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of people would know what you were talking about, and right now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's most associated with Furutama (sp?) and Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movies (at least that's what people say when I bring it up).
</EM><BR>
<P>And those views of it -- the Futurama (I don't know how to spell it either:)
<BR>
TV show and Austin Powers movie -- are not kooky?:)
<BR>
<P>Most people I know who I talk to about this stuff do not know a lot about
<BR>
it.  And I talk mostly to people who are technology professionals.  (Sure,
<BR>
anyone can meet someone over the internet who shares her or his interest in
<BR>
cryonics or what have you, but in my person to person contacts, what I said
<BR>
is the case.)  Now, as one can see in my previous email and this one, I
<BR>
don't claim these people know nothing about it.  I merely claim they don't
<BR>
know a lot about it and are probably assigning it a low priority in their
<BR>
lives and minds anyhow.
<BR>
<P>If we constantly worry, &quot;What will everyone think of us?&quot; then very little
<BR>
will get done, IMHO.  I'm sure you've all heard of that donkey story in one
<BR>
of Aesop's fable...
<BR>
<P>Who's kidding who?:)
