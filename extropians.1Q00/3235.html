<EM>&gt; Please. That's most scientifically likely bit of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie. A trinary system is, at least theoretically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible, but it wouldn't likely be stable enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a planet capable of sustaining life, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capturing a rock tht might bear dormant, hibernating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the right masses, a Lagrange like point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stability may exist between two of the stars, and one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might well be a very large gas giant. What could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really interesting is the orbit our theoretical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planetoid could take. It could full well wind up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transiting *between* the three stars.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, if my memory's correct from my physics courses, in order for there
<BR>
to be a Langrange points, the masses of the bodies involved have to vary
<BR>
such that the largest one is at least 25 times as massive as the other two.
<BR>
(Someone else might do the math here to find out if this is the case.)
<BR>
<P>However, one need not worry about such things if the stars are separate far
<BR>
enough.  It's speculated with the nearby trinary (Alpha, Beta, and Proximi
<BR>
Centauri) one could have a viable planetary system without the others
<BR>
interfering if the planets are in close enough orbits.  I don't recall the
<BR>
reference to this, but it was in a reputable source.  (I don't usually read
<BR>
the junk sources anyway.:)
<BR>
<P>The more zaney orbits, such as some planet transiting between three stars
<BR>
are unlikely given that unless a three body system reaches some sort of
<BR>
stability, one body is often ejected.  (Yeah, you might point out that the
<BR>
solar system exists, but the Sun is larger than all the other bodies in it.)
<BR>
Of course, there's always a chance something could come about like that.  I
<BR>
just think it highly unlikely.  In fact, if I was a betting man, I'd give it
<BR>
less than 1000 to 1 odds in happening in any trinary system with planets...
<BR>
(This is pure guess on my part, so don't attach any significance to my
<BR>
numbers, especially before I'm completely awake.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
