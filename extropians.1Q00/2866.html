<EM>&gt; &gt;What about the UCLA study of vitamin C published in 1992?  This was not
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;most rigorous study, but it tracked over 11K individuals over about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;decade.  The findings?  Men taking 800 mg of vitamin C per day lived
</EM><BR>
about 6
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;years longer than those taking 60 mg of the same per day.  Another 9 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;study completed in 1996 with a similar population size seemed to confirm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this, though the study focused on vitamins C and E, rather than just
</EM><BR>
vitamin
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;C.  Granted, those are only two studies, but that beat Lee Daniel's above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;statement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     The problem with  these studies is that there's no way to control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for other variables.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The kind of person who takes 800 mg of vitamin C probably does a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great many other things to enhance life extension: e.g. exercise, eat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a low-fat diet, and of course take other vitamins.  The person who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes 60 mg probably isn't too serious.  Until it's possible to do an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extensive long-term study of individuals so isolated that every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible variable affecting their health is controlled it won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to take these studies seriously.  And who would volunteer?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that while long term such studies are not perfect, they indicate
<BR>
something.  Also, the particular studies I mentioned are not the only ones.
<BR>
There are plenty of short term studies with vitamin C where the variables
<BR>
are controlled much more fully and other factors are measured (e.g.,
<BR>
homocysteine levels in blood) and the lot of these seem to point in the
<BR>
direction of the two I mentioned.  Extrapolation is not forbidden...:)
<BR>
<P>Also, the mechanisms by which that particular nutrient works are becoming
<BR>
more well known.  Ultimately, what one wants is a causal explanation of why
<BR>
it works at all.  (This is typically how one finds out why it does not work
<BR>
in all cases and how one can develop a regimen.)
<BR>
<P>There are plenty of short term studies on other supplements which show them
<BR>
working to alleviate one problem or another.  One must study them and make
<BR>
judgements regarding the costs and benifits.  But anyone who says there
<BR>
aren't any studies on this (as Lee Daniel did several posts ago) is
<BR>
misinformed.  (Or a lot of what I've read on the subject for the past decade
<BR>
is all wrong.  I sure hope not.:)
<BR>
<P>Also, remember, my original post in this thread was _not_ in advocacy of
<BR>
popping pills, but of a broad spectrum, informed approach to life extension.
<BR>
My goal -- and I hope the goal of all or many of you reading this -- is to
<BR>
live longer, healthier, and happier -- not merely to adhere to some doctrine
<BR>
of self-medication.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
