'What is your name?'  'Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.'  'Do you deny having written 
<BR>
the following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, I think it's considered to be a dead horse because everyone with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something original to say about the subject has either already said it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is tired of discussing it, doesn't think it's worth it, or all three.
</EM><BR>
<P>Our claims needn't NECESSARILY be in disagreement.  While my claim was
<BR>
stronger than this, I could have made the smaller claim that &quot;qualia is a
<BR>
dead horse because no argument can be given that will convince a believer
<BR>
or a non-believer that they are wrong.&quot;  Certainly, if all of the
<BR>
interesting/original arguments have already been made, and THEY haven't
<BR>
worked, none of the boring/repetitive arguments will do any better.  So it
<BR>
seems that we're more or less in agreement on this point.
<BR>
<P>Now, of course, I ALSO gave an account of WHY, it seems to me, no
<BR>
convincing argument can be given for either side. (Where, here, I'm using
<BR>
&quot;convincing&quot; in the technical sense of actually convincing someone who
<BR>
disagrees with you.)  You don't seem to like my account that qualia are a
<BR>
matter of axioms, but you haven't told me why.  I DO like my account,
<BR>
because people like Zeb and John and Kate Riley have made the argument
<BR>
that qualia are axiomatically necessary explicit; in an important respect,
<BR>
I'm just reporting the fact that this is what people think.
<BR>
<P>I don't suppose you have any mention of qualia on your website?  I recall
<BR>
that one not-an-argument on your meaning of life FAQ, but it was
<BR>
sufficiently cryptic that I couldn't make any sense of it.
<BR>
