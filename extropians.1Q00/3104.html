<P>
I hope I have everyone's sympathy when I tell you that I will have my Net 
<BR>
connected temporarily amputated for a few days, as I will be away and I'm 
<BR>
not taking a computer with me. (However, the pain of Net 
<BR>
separation--especially from my new DSL line--will be more than compensated 
<BR>
for by the great time I'll have skiing in Telluride with the love of my life.)
<BR>
<P>Today will be busy, but I'll try to respond to any urgent ExI matters. From 
<BR>
Saturday until Thursday, please address any ExI-related questions to ExI 
<BR>
directors who are active on this board (Greg Burch and Robert Bradbury).
<BR>
<P>BTW, I never responded to a few messages sparked by John Grigg's mention of 
<BR>
a project I'm working on. Somehow the idea arose that I was working at a 
<BR>
start-up and was warned of burn-out etc. Just to defuse misunderstanding--I 
<BR>
am not an employee with stock options in a start-up. I am consulting with a 
<BR>
company without that kind of pressure. You can see some of the results of 
<BR>
that work (still in an early stage with much content and functionality to 
<BR>
come) at www.manyworlds.com. Anyone interested in the &quot;New Economy&quot; will 
<BR>
love the site!
<BR>
<P>Onward!
