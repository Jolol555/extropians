<P>
Robert &amp; Eliezer have been discussing the Clock of the Long Now.
<BR>
<P>Unless I'm miss-remembering, there was a presentation on this at
<BR>
Extro3.  So, now they are up to the point of building it.
<BR>
<P>I'm still thinking what I thought at Extro3 -- and the point is ???
<BR>
<P>I don't see any way of stopping the Juggernaut, and I suspect Robin
<BR>
would agree.  The economic forces at work and inertia they contain
<BR>
are simply to great.  Its like Natasha standing out in the middle of
<BR>
I-80, holding the Mona Lisa, with a caption saying &quot;here be art
<BR>
that can stop the world&quot;, in the meantime, along comes Mick's truck,
<BR>
he's squinting, trying to read the caption, oooopppps, too late...
<BR>
<P>(byegones, it was too good an image to resist sharing...)
<BR>
<P>If they are doing this to try and get us to wake up and go slower,
<BR>
all I can do is wish them is lots of luck.  I'd put the odds pretty
<BR>
low for the thing lasting long enough for the first cuckoo to tweet.
<BR>
That much matter has to have a better purpose in holding some high
<BR>
density SI memories.  As virtual clock &quot;memory&quot; and virtual tweets
<BR>
its much cheaper.
<BR>
<P>Sooner or later people will come to treat physical reality the
<BR>
same way they do data files -- if it isn't of any use now, you
<BR>
might as well compress it and put it on a backup tape.
<BR>
<P>Robert
