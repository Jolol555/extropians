<P>Norwegian Returns to Life After Severe Hypothermia
<BR>
By Patricia Reaney
<BR>
<P>LONDON (Reuters) - A Norwegian woman whose body temperature dropped to 56.7 
<BR>
F in a skiing accident was brought back to life after she was thawed, 
<BR>
doctors said Friday.
<BR>
<P>The unidentified 29-year-old skier, who was clinically dead, is the only 
<BR>
known person to have survived after such severe hypothermia.
<BR>
<P>``As far as we know it is the lowest body temperature of anybody who has 
<BR>
survived from being dead and cold -- 13.7 degrees (56.7 F). There are no 
<BR>
other reports as low as that,'' Dr Mads Gilbert, of Tromso University 
<BR>
Hospital in Norway, told Reuters.
<BR>
<P>The previous lowest body temperature that anyone survived was 57.92 F 
<BR>
recorded in a child. Less than a third of adults whose body temperature 
<BR>
drops below 82.40 F recover.
<BR>
<P>``I would describe the case as a new confirmation that we should never give 
<BR>
up in cases were people are cooled down. They should be warmed up before you 
<BR>
declare them dead,'' Gilbert said.
<BR>
<P>......
<BR>
<P><P>``She was clinically dead for a couple of hours,'' said Gilbert, one of 
<BR>
dozens of doctors who has treated her since the accident last May.
<BR>
<P>Writing in the Lancet medical journal, Gilbert and his colleagues described 
<BR>
how the woman fell while skiing down a waterfall gully. She was wedged 
<BR>
between rock and overhanging ice for 40 minutes in a space continually 
<BR>
flooded with icy water.
<BR>
<P>.....
<BR>
<P>Although she was not breathing and had no circulation by the time she 
<BR>
reached the hospital, doctors used a cardiopulmonary bypass to remove her 
<BR>
blood, warm it outside the body, and then return it to the body.
<BR>
<P>Gilbert said the icy water cooled her body to the point where her heart had 
<BR>
stopped. It also cooled her brain enough so it could sustain a long period 
<BR>
without oxygen supply.
<BR>
<P>``The sequence of cooling in this particular case probably is one of the key 
<BR>
factors for this extremely good result,'' he said.
<BR>
<P>The woman has no recollection of the accident.
