Some life extensionists have voiced concerns about the 
<BR>
free-radical-promoting nature of the mineral iron. The 
<BR>
Life Extension Foundation has raised such concerns and 
<BR>
does not include iron in their main formula. All I've 
<BR>
seen on iron since first hearing such concerns supports 
<BR>
such concerns, such as the following new study that finds 
<BR>
unusually high levels of iron in the brains of Alzheimer 
<BR>
patients. The study notes: &quot;Iron can catalyze [promote] 
<BR>
free radical reactions and may contribute to oxidative 
<BR>
damage observed in AD brains.&quot; It then concludes: &quot;The 
<BR>
data replicate and extend prior results and suggest that 
<BR>
basal ganglia ferritin iron levels are increased in AD.&quot;

<P>BACKGROUND: The basal ganglia contain the highest levels 
<BR>
of iron in the brain, and postmortem studies indicate a 
<BR>
disruption of iron metabolism in the basal ganglia of 
<BR>
patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Iron can catalyze 
<BR>
free radical reactions and may contribute to oxidative 
<BR>
damage observed in AD brains. Treatments aimed at reducing 
<BR>
oxidative damage have offered novel ways to delay the rate 
<BR>
of progression and could possibly defer the onset of AD. 
<BR>
Brain iron levels were quantified in vivo using a new 
<BR>
magnetic resonance imaging method. METHODS: Thirty-one 
<BR>
patients with AD and 68 control subjects participated 
<BR>
in this study. A magnetic resonance imaging method was 
<BR>
employed that quantifies the iron content of ferritin 
<BR>
molecules (ferritin iron) with specificity through the 
<BR>
combined use of high and low field-strength magnetic 
<BR>
resonance imaging instruments. Three basal ganglia 
<BR>
structures (caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus) 
<BR>
and one comparison region (frontal lobe white matter) 
<BR>
were evaluated. RESULTS: Basal ganglia ferritin iron 
<BR>
levels were significantly increased in the caudate 
<BR>
(P = .007; effect size, 0.69) and putamen (P = .008; 
<BR>
effect size, 0.67) of AD subjects, with a trend toward 
<BR>
an increase in the globus pallidus (P = .13). The 
<BR>
increased basal ganglia ferritin iron levels were not 
<BR>
a generalized phenomenon; white matter ferritin iron 
<BR>
levels were unchanged in patients with AD (P = .50). 
<BR>
CONCLUSIONS: The data replicate and extend prior 
<BR>
results and suggest that basal ganglia ferritin iron 
<BR>
levels are increased in AD. Prospective studies are 
<BR>
needed to evaluate whether premorbid iron levels are 
<BR>
increased in individuals who develop AD.
