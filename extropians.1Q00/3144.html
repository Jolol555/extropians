<EM>&gt; &gt; In Netscape, the button on the message list header row that has four
</EM><BR>
horizontal
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lines on it is the button to hit to sort messages into threads, and it
</EM><BR>
relates
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threaded messages by the message references in the message header.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I use that often, but it gets spoofed on the extropy list quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often- some posts don't get assigned to their threads properly.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppose I should look into the details to see how and why this happens,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I'm not that ambitious right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>The incoming mail from this list is the most difficult to file away that
<BR>
I've found. That's a bastard, because it also has very high traffic.
<BR>
<P>I find that, no matter how many different rules I set up to catch incoming
<BR>
extro mail, and send it to my extro mail folder, some always leaks into my
<BR>
inbox, because the mail is sent to some alias the sender has set up, or
<BR>
because the mail goes to an old server long since gone the way of the
<BR>
dinosaurs, but still redirected to extropy.com. Most other lists I've come
<BR>
across have little tags in the subject line for sorting mail. Can't we do
<BR>
that?
<BR>
<P>Oh I forgot, we have to be different. $@#@$%
