<EM>&gt; &gt; All advanced projects on the Internet that I can think of have

<EM>&gt; &gt; been started by private individuals and companies; the role of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the government is limited to watching for old issues (can a child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see naked butts online?), providing general resources ($ for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thicker carrier cables), and general regulation of development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (such as patent laws).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even if the government was doing more good than harm in any of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; areas, it would still mean that the visionary development is done by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; private individuals, and the democratic governance is only able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; provide support for already established structures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding libraries, yes, Carnegie and many more regular people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donated time, money, and materials for the support of the library system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; however it survives because it has been supported by public funds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning in the 19th century for the public good. Yes, I don't always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get what I want there, yet it has and still serves a critical function for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; millions of people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, if we want to champion individualism over collectivism the system in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; United States is a slippery target. I can not think of any part of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that government legislation did not provide the foundation for the &quot;rugged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individualists&quot; to be successful. Monroe Doctrine, easement rights for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; railroads, build up of an industrial base by both the North and South during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Civil War, tariffs in the latter 19th century protecting American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufactuers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from foreign compeition, the electronics industry during and after WW2,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program, DARPA, etc, etc, etc. Why it is a slippery target because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result, if not intention, has been to is give private enterprise a running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using its resources to get past the hardest, most costly part and then take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from there. In this way it can not provide a clear foil in the individualism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collectivism arguement as would comparison to the economic/social models
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Third Reich, Soviet Russia, ancient Egypt or feudal China.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have had no public weapons industries except for the Springfield
<BR>
Arsenal, which deals exclusively with artillery and light infantry
<BR>
weapons research. Claiming that someone that is a government contractor
<BR>
is getting a collectivist push is only so because only government has a
<BR>
monopoly on the use of massive force. Most all new technologies are
<BR>
first applied in use on the battlefield, and people are willing to spend
<BR>
whatever it takes most of the time to have a well equipped military that
<BR>
can hold its own against anyone else. If this were not a world where
<BR>
states held the monopoly on massive force, you would see probably more
<BR>
research but less actual implementation in military hardware. Private
<BR>
organizations typically are not as capable of getting other people to
<BR>
spend money for them as well as government can. Corporations don't open
<BR>
your wallet at the point of a gun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What history says to me that individualistic or collectivistic societies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophies are premised on distorted perspectives of who and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human beings are. We are both social (collective) and individual so our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; societies need to reflect a similar balance which is no mean trick and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always successful, but it is none the less the most correct approch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is social?
