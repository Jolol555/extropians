<P>&lt;&lt;  I suspect the (somewhat
<BR>
&nbsp;disciplined) imagination of sf writers might be as good a guide as anything
<BR>
&nbsp;an engineer or psychologist might come up with.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>NO NO NO!!!!! 
<BR>
You've missed my point entirely. I have read any and everything I can on 
<BR>
jacking in, etc. Thanks for giving me a couple titles, but... Most of us have 
<BR>
read sci-fi. I want to know what THE LIST envisions their OWN personal 
<BR>
experience of uploading, not what sci-fi authors think. I believe it might be 
<BR>
valuable to do so *on list* since this is the pool of talent that is most 
<BR>
inherently prone towards researching and making such a thing possible -- 
<BR>
exactly NOT as fiction, but as their own reality. I even know people who are 
<BR>
studying neuroscience to help it happen!! 
<BR>
<P>Without a clear cut vision of one's own ideal of such a transformation, one 
<BR>
would be left at the mercy of other's ideas, wouldn't one? Would you like to 
<BR>
upload into what might be a virtual HELL for you, because that's the only 
<BR>
option available for immortality??? 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(PS: I find Neuromancer/Snow Crash scenario inviting, yet depressing. Fancy 
<BR>
being a burned out hacker, living in a storage unit and jacking into VR? 
<BR>
Anyhoo, it is not uploading. Uploading is preserving your entity as a 
<BR>
nonphysical AI being inside a computer)
<BR>
Quite a different thing.)
<BR>
(PSS Sci-fi quite frankly is not compelling to me, most of it, since the post 
<BR>
Armageddon &quot;trashed planet&quot; theme is so prevalent -- or exo-terran bleak off 
<BR>
world colonies run by robots scenarios. Acid rain and drug addicts. 
<BR>
Woo-hoo!!! Fun! 
<BR>
<P>Not at all what I think of when i envision a dynamically - optimistic 
<BR>
&quot;extropic future&quot;. I have search hi and lo for images of a positive future 
<BR>
both in fiction and in films, and all I ever get, is doom, black hole, post 
<BR>
apocolyptic crap. Even Syd Mead, my idol, tends that way when the film 
<BR>
industry calls, a la Blade Runner. Frankly, I see a much more Utopic view.)
