Economic growth and technical progress is driving us forward regardless of 
<BR>
what these two people decide. Given the complexity of the world and the 
<BR>
range of talents and abilities that exist, the notions that one or the other 
<BR>
of them is going to become or create the first Power is simply a fantasy. 
<BR>
Our future is not in the hands of these two, but depends on the industrial, 
<BR>
academic and military research being performed in thousands of labs all over 
<BR>
the world.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Our future is most likely not in the hands of these two, but I wish to say 
<BR>
that I believe Eliezer deserves to have a patron/investor who would fund his 
<BR>
seed AI project.  So much money in this world is simply squandered and I 
<BR>
would like to see some (ten million of it) go his way.  Eliezer deserves to 
<BR>
at least have a fighting chance to achieve his goal.  These are just empty 
<BR>
words because I lack the money but if I had the necessary wealth I would 
<BR>
fund him.  The irony is that I have a great uncle (who I have no contact 
<BR>
with) who could at least in part.
<BR>
<P>He might just be onto some lines of thought that could bring forth powerful 
<BR>
AI a number of years before we would normally have it.  This could literally 
<BR>
save humanity if a dangerous nano were released on the world and human 
<BR>
researchers simply did not have the time needed to find a solution.  A very 
<BR>
powerful AI would have a fighting chance to save the day.
<BR>
<P>I often wonder why list members who are so educated, intelligent and 
<BR>
forward-looking are not extremely rich technology tycoons! lol  I still 
<BR>
think one of you should have invented Ebay!  There must be factors like 
<BR>
burning ambition, extreme inventiveness and being in the right place at the 
<BR>
right time that are missing.  Perhaps eventually, we will have some stellar 
<BR>
successes.  I hope so.  Don't forget Eli or the Extropian Institute when you 
<BR>
get there.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
