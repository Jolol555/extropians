<P><EM>&gt;So, recumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Just call me old-fashioned.
<BR>
<P>Also, I invested a fair bit of myself and extra gear for
<BR>
my touring bicycle. I had that dear thing bike built custom
<BR>
for me 15 years ago when touring bicycles for women didn't exist.
<BR>
I'll keep my old metal friend until it disintegrates, probably.
<BR>
<P>However, I'm glad that there are people like you breaking new
<BR>
ground in the recumbents. Those bikes a great idea (and yes
<BR>
they do look silly). I'm not so sure how they would be for touring
<BR>
a few thousand miles, but I confess I never looked seriously
<BR>
into them. You see, I am rather ... attached ... to mine.
<BR>
<P>(here we are from 1986
