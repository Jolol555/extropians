&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media Release, 17 November 1997
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Australia encourages inventor of revolutionary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gun technology
<BR>
<P>A revolutionary rapid-fire gun invented in Australia may have
<BR>
greater potential for development in this country with the signing
<BR>
of a Department of Defence Industry, Alliance, the Minister for
<BR>
Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop, said
<BR>
today.
<BR>
<P>The industry alliance, signed today between the Defence Science
<BR>
and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and Metal Storm Pty Ltd,
<BR>
enables closer consultation and communication between both
<BR>
parties.
<BR>
<P>Metal Storm's new gun technology enables construction of guns
<BR>
capable of firing more than one million rounds per minute - a
<BR>
much higher rate of fire than conventional rapid-fire weapons
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There will be greater opportunity for joint Australian-US
<BR>
development of the technology because of the DSTO agreement
<BR>
with Metal Storm Pty. There already appears to be strong interest
<BR>
in this invention from the United States defence industry&quot;, Mrs
<BR>
Bishop said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The industry alliance will enable DSTO more readily to assess the
<BR>
potential of the Metal Storm technology for defence applications,
<BR>
including those most relevant to the needs of the Australian
<BR>
Defence Force.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The alliance will also allow the Metal Storm company better
<BR>
access to DSTO's in-depth knowledge of Defence and defence
<BR>
science.
<BR>
<P>Metal Storm is the first entirely electronically operated ballistics
<BR>
system, and the first which fires without the mechanical
<BR>
operations of conventional guns. Multiple barrels can be closely
<BR>
packed together to provide simple yet high performance weapons
<BR>
with an infinitely variable rate of fire.
<BR>
<P>The weapon's inventor and managing director of Metal Storm Pty
<BR>
Ltd, Mr Mike O'Dwyer, of Brisbane, has demonstrated Metal
<BR>
Storm to United States defence companies.
<BR>
<P>The head of DSTO, Chief Defence Scientist Dr Richard
<BR>
Brabin-Smith, signed the alliance on behalf of the
<BR>
Commonwealth, and Mr O'Dwyer on behalf of Metal Storm Pty
<BR>
Ltd.
<BR>
<P>Further Information:
<BR>
<P>Ministerial - Jennifer Eddy 0416 266 120
<BR>
DSTO - Stephen Butler 08 8259 5036
<BR>
Metal Storm Pty Ltd 07 3279 5918
<BR>
<P>Background
<BR>
<P>The Metal Storm weapon is pre-loaded with multiple rounds in
<BR>
each barrel and can achieve rates of fire as high as 45,000 rounds
<BR>
per minute per barrel. Concept demonstration weapons have up
<BR>
to 36 barrels and are currently designed to fire 9mm rounds at a
<BR>
muzzle velocity of approximately 300 metres per second.
<BR>
<P>An industry alliance is a specific agreement between DSTO and a
<BR>
company (or cluster of companies) which is designed to enhance
<BR>
communication between DSTO and industry over a long-term
<BR>
period, usually three to five years. The improved communication
<BR>
may lead to opportunities for early industry involvement in DSTO
<BR>
research activities, for DSTO support to initiatives taken within
<BR>
industry, and also to increase Defence awareness and
<BR>
enhancement of Australian industry capabilities.
