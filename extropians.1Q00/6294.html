<P>
There once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who lived on
<BR>
the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants that
<BR>
would probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the time
<BR>
to study them.
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes referred
<BR>
to as &quot;mother&quot;, although she didn't mean to imply by this term that she
<BR>
would have thought less of the person if a close biological link did not
<BR>
in fact exist.
<BR>
<P>Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of nontraditional
<BR>
households, although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed.
<BR>
<P>One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown fruit
<BR>
and mineral water to her grandmother's house.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people who
<BR>
have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between
<BR>
various people in the woods?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union boss
<BR>
and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for womyn to
<BR>
oppress each other, since all womyn were equally oppressed until all
<BR>
womyn were free.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, since
<BR>
he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?&quot;
<BR>
<P>And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was attending a
<BR>
special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't stereotypical
<BR>
womyn's work, but an empowering deed that would help engender a feeling
<BR>
of community.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and
<BR>
hence
<BR>
unable to independently further her own selfhood?&quot;
<BR>
But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't 
<BR>
actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way,
<BR>
although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were
<BR>
inferior to what some people called &quot;health&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of
<BR>
delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.
<BR>
Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous
<BR>
place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based
<BR>
on cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded
<BR>
the natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that
<BR>
natural predators were in fact intolerable competitors.
<BR>
<P>Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but Red
<BR>
Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized
<BR>
peoples would be able to &quot;come out&quot; of the woods and be accepted as
<BR>
valid lifestyle role models.
<BR>
<P>On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper, and
<BR>
wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.
<BR>
<P>She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked her
<BR>
what was in her basket.
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers, but
<BR>
she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, and
<BR>
chose to dialogue with the Wolf.
<BR>
<P>She replied, &quot;I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a
<BR>
gesture of solidarity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Wolf said, &quot;You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to
<BR>
walk through these woods alone.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood said, &quot;I find your sexist remark offensive in the
<BR>
extreme, but I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an
<BR>
outcast from society, the stress of which has caused you to develop an
<BR>
alternative and yet entirely valid worldview. Now, if you'll excuse me,
<BR>
I would prefer to be on my way.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her
<BR>
Grandmother's house.
<BR>
<P>But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish
<BR>
adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker
<BR>
route to Grandma's house.
<BR>
<P>He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action affirmative
<BR>
of his nature as a predator.
<BR>
<P>Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he put on
<BR>
Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited
<BR>
developments.
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said, &quot;Grandma, I have brought
<BR>
you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and
<BR>
nurturing matriarch.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Wolf said softly &quot;Come closer, child, so that I might see you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Red Riding Hood said, &quot;Goddess! Grandma, what big eyes you have!&quot;
<BR>
&quot;You forget that I am optically challenged.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but I
<BR>
didn't give in to such societal pressures, my child.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a
<BR>
reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed,
<BR>
grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she
<BR>
could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Aren't you forgetting something?&quot; Red Riding Hood bravely shouted. &quot;You
<BR>
must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of
<BR>
intimacy!&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp on
<BR>
her. At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage,
<BR>
brandishing an ax.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Hands off!&quot; cried the woodchopper.
<BR>
<P>&quot;And what do you think you're doing?&quot; cried Little Red Riding Hood. &quot;If
<BR>
I
<BR>
let you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in my
<BR>
own
<BR>
abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement
<BR>
scores on college entrance exams.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Last chance, sister! Get your hands off that endangered species! This
<BR>
is an FBI sting!&quot; screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red Riding
<BR>
Hood
<BR>
nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Thank goodness you got here in time&quot;, said the Wolf. &quot;The brat and her
<BR>
grandmother lured me in here. I thought I was a goner.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;No, I think I'm the real victim here&quot;, said the woodchopper. &quot;I've been
<BR>
dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those protected
<BR>
flowers earlier. And now I'm going to have such a trauma. Do you have
<BR>
any aspirin?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Sure&quot;, said the Wolf.
<BR>
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;I feel your pain&quot;, said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on his
<BR>
firm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said &quot;Do you have any
<BR>
Maalox?&quot;
<BR>
