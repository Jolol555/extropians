<P><EM>&gt; Did my standard Spikish number last night at the local free Municipal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Library, to a motley audience of 12 or 15. Several corpulent science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fiction fans were in evidence, who looked at first like a support team if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started being heckled by the pensioners. Instead, 0ne of them, a youngish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman, soon began to mutter, smirk, roll her eyes and then declaim when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got to the AIs. The uploads took her over the edge. Her consort seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly embarrassed by her fervor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All nonsense, she cried, you just want a world of soulless cyborgs. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer can't do anything of its own accord, a computer can't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness. Oh? Why not? *It's not alive! It can only do what it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed to do. I'm a sociologist! I'm a utilitarian! I'm a sociologist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I'm here to tell you that computers can't do anything unless they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed to do it.*  And so on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mentioned that she was also programmed, by genes and culture, and she got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly indignant. I was trying to pretend she was a machine! She did things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *just because she wanted to*! She'd broken away from the restrictions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her social upbringing etc etc. Not very much, you haven't, I said, and her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face swelled attractively. No, I said, what I mean is... you're speaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; English now, aren't you? You're wearing clothing not unlikely the garments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we all wear. I see no Zulu hat upon your head.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By this point I suppose I was patently a tool of hell, except that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presumably she didn't actually believe in hell or souls, just in `life'. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went sideways. Suppose we insert a very thin tube into a person's head and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace a single neuron with a-- Ah, yes, you'd like to do that, wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, your type!  Chop people's brains up, turn them into machines without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; souls. No, hang on, let's say you just did this with a mouse-- I could see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her delighted confirmation as my gleeful robotic cruelty to our dumb animal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brethren was shamelessly revealed. And so on. Altogether frustrating,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because presumably she wasn't stupid or unimaginative (she read some sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of sf, after all). It was a salutary experience, giving me some sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the *real* opposition might be like, out there in the world in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teeming blithering bigoted billions. Urp.

<P>Hello Damien,
<BR>
<P>First, my visual imagination failed in an effort to construct the image of
<BR>
a &quot;corpulent&quot; woman whose face was attractive when it swelled. For
<BR>
obscure reasons, I thought of Eugene Ionesco's play, whose title and
<BR>
subtitle are:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE  BALD  SOPRANO
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ She Always Wears Her Hair The Same Way ~
<BR>
<P>Well, I wrote to see how you interpret the woman's obviously defensive
<BR>
behavior.  Look at it from contrasting perspectives: [1] objectively, the
<BR>
idea of a machine capable of anthropomorphic cognition is THREATENING;
<BR>
[2] subjectively, some unconscious tendency is ATTRACTED to this idea
<BR>
(i.e. it is a fascinating and alluring value) against which attraction the
<BR>
conscious self-image must protect itself by overdetermined and melo-
<BR>
dramatic denial.
<BR>
<P>Questions: [1] what, specifically, is endangered by this thought?; [2]
<BR>
what is it in the conscious organization that is viewed as irreconcilable
<BR>
with this idea, such that if the unconscious correlate were to gain
<BR>
conscious  ascendancy, any coexistence would be impossible and the
<BR>
current conscious ego-constiuent would be driven into oblivion?
<BR>
<P>As a parenthetical issue, if we assume that the threat entails, among
<BR>
other things, a potential identity-crisis, what is the woman so identified
<BR>
with that its loss is anticipated as catastrophic?
