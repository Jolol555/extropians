<P>
This should have gone to the list a couple of days back but it only went to
<BR>
Anders (courtesy mischievous reply-to-sender button). It will be interesting
<BR>
to think more systematically about these problems when I get time - it seems
<BR>
quite complex, as several people have remarked. 
<BR>
<P>(BTW, we did the studio debate today for the BBC programme on the ethics and
<BR>
feasibility of life-extension. Don't know exactly when it's going to be
<BR>
aired yet.)

<BR>
<P><EM>		&gt;I assumed the future mind would be me minus the
</EM><BR>
<EM>		&gt;awareness of the experiences being simulation. I don't know
</EM><BR>
if that
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;really can be viewed as a different person than me, after
</EM><BR>
all the
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;difference is just a lack of knowledge. Do I have the right
</EM><BR>
of putting
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;myself through torture? Obviously yes.
</EM><BR>
<P>As long as the decision-maker and the pain-experiencer are &quot;the same&quot;, there
<BR>
does not seem to be a moral problem.
<BR>
<P>But same in what sense? Same as in &quot;same consciousness&quot;? That doesn't seem
<BR>
to work, because we want to say that my present time-segment can morally
<BR>
choose to give pain to my time-segment of tomorrow, although my present
<BR>
segment cannot feel the pain. Or maybe we assume that there is no moral
<BR>
problem in this case only because we have evolved to care about our future
<BR>
segments so the problem doesn't arise much in the real world. So for
<BR>
practical purposes, the present time segment can be the coercing guardian of
<BR>
your future time segments. But I wonder how this might change if we
<BR>
construct &quot;perverse&quot; beings who don't have this degree of care for their
<BR>
future selves. If a present segment doesn't care about a future segment, do
<BR>
we still want to say that they both belong to the same person, provided only
<BR>
that they have a lot of memories in common? Do we want to give coercive
<BR>
rights to the earlier segment over the later segment simply because it
<BR>
happens to be at an earlier temporal position? This is not at all obvious,
<BR>
and well worth thinking about further.
<BR>
<P>Imagine the political campaigns...  &quot;One segment, one vote!&quot;, &quot;End temporal
<BR>
discrimination now!&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>		&gt;Perhaps. Remember, this isn't my own idea, I was just
</EM><BR>
repeating it
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;from a friend (Andreas Svedin). But I think he has a point
</EM><BR>
with his
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;thought experiment, not just because it involves
</EM><BR>
interesting ethical
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;questions. Adding new knowledge to a mind isn't just a
</EM><BR>
question of
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;downloading it, it has to be integrated into the network of
</EM><BR>
<EM>		&gt;connections that forms our worldview, our personality, our
</EM><BR>
selves
<BR>
<P>Sure, in general I agree with that. But when it comes to &quot;knowledge of
<BR>
pain&quot;, well, it doesn't seem to contain a whole lot of information content
<BR>
(the pain, as opposed to the various sensations that might accompany it).
<BR>
Rather, I suggest, the people who talk about being wiser after having
<BR>
experienced a lot of pain, are referring to emotional changes that have
<BR>
taken place, not so much bits of information that have been added to their
<BR>
network. And it might be much more feasible to bring about these emotional
<BR>
changes directly (maybe through chemicals or gene therapy) than it would be
<BR>
to download &quot;knowledge of thermodynamics&quot;, for instance.
