<EM>&gt; &gt;As SIs would be much older than us,

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps they've self-evolved as quickly as we are about to.  Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relatively short head-start, might be just enough to always be just out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our reach.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Could it be that the suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is what creates the curiosity that drives us to develop technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that shape the world and eventually reach for the stars?  As the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; saying goes, &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I apologize.  When I was referring to creativity, I wasn't thinking only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of art.  I expect that suffering, though not the only, nor even best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motivator, has lead us to create solutions.  You made my point more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively.  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Suffering, as the Buddha said, is caused by desire. Desire is caused by need.
<BR>
Inventions satisfy need, thereby satisfying desire and allaying suffering. Its not an
<BR>
accident that &quot;lotus eater&quot; type  societies never developed much technology.
