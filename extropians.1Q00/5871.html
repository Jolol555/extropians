I think this is blatantly and obviously BS. My Grandmother is dead! I miss 
<BR>
her horribly and feel huge amounts of pain because of this. She is the 
<BR>
creator of my parents and ultimately of me and has given me much of the 
<BR>
world I have. She deserves this world she gave to me much more than I do. 
<BR>
The fact that she is now dead is BAD! No thinking any being could possibly 
<BR>
do, whether emotional or purely abstract rational thinking like a computer 
<BR>
could do, make this anything other than BAD, and the fact that we are still 
<BR>
alive Good.

<BR>
<P>Brent, I am very sorry to learn of your grandmother's death and the pain it 
<BR>
has caused you.  I miss my grandmother too, who used to be a professor at 
<BR>
Loyola many years ago.  I do think your grandmother was as deserving of this 
<BR>
world as you or anyone and so I can understand at least partially your 
<BR>
frustration.
<BR>
<P>I agree that her death may have been simply entropy at work and from the 
<BR>
human perspective, a very bad thing.  Sometimes I think people get a little 
<BR>
too philosophical about discussing the jarring and painful realities of 
<BR>
present-day life until they get slammed in the face by it as Mike Darwin 
<BR>
pointed out in his excellent post awhile back.  That post warrants 
<BR>
re-reading by all list members.

Why would you say such a thing? I understand that you care, but given the 
<BR>
gradual evolution of society, and the increase of knowledge, what you can 
<BR>
create, etc. I would rank people alive today as being more valuable than 
<BR>
people alive in yester-year.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It offends me to think that the people alive today are somehow more valuable 
<BR>
and important then people from the past.  I think I realize that what you 
<BR>
are saying is that people today are part of an incredibly vital social and 
<BR>
technological wave of progress, but still I think humans from a past 
<BR>
generation which is gone or more importantly dying off from old-age is still 
<BR>
extremely important.
<BR>
<P>I do realize that in a somewhat cold-blooded but realistic take on things 
<BR>
that people do have varying levels of worth, period.  This would be based on 
<BR>
what they can offer society (their fellow humans) in the forms of training, 
<BR>
talents and skills they have to offer.  In this way intelligence, education, 
<BR>
health and personal ambition all play a part in achieving worth and in 
<BR>
response society tends to reward these people with more money, social 
<BR>
opportunities and resources (even sex partners).

There is no inherent BADness to death, you perceive the loss as bad because 
<BR>
you miss her. Unfortunately because this exists in the realm of your 
<BR>
experience, probably nothing I could say will change your mind.  There are 
<BR>
exercises that I might be able to do with you to get youto see this, but it 
<BR>
is fundamentally a Zen &quot;aha&quot; experience, that people must arrive at on their 
<BR>
own.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Much of this does depend on the perspective one has.  Another person might 
<BR>
say how happy they are grandma is in Heaven now, free of pain and with her 
<BR>
loved ones who went before.  Or they might be glad to see she has entered a 
<BR>
sad but final stage to the life process, which for now is death.  They would 
<BR>
think she had a good and fulfilling life so there is no real tragedy.
<BR>
<P>Of course, someone of an extropian bent could easily be outraged, since they 
<BR>
believe these previous memes I listed are 'cop-outs' and ways of 
<BR>
rationalizing the horrors of mortality, and that grandma should have had the 
<BR>
chance to become a near-immortal but from the random unfairness of life she 
<BR>
was born too early.  But in the evolutionary view of things, our beloved 
<BR>
grandparents are vehicles for genes and fortunately they did their job of 
<BR>
reproduction before death overtook them.  Nature does not care about them as 
<BR>
individuals and is a ruthless force, ultimately.

We *will* lose some of the people on this list. The best we can do is 
<BR>
cherish them, honor them and share their wisdom and insights with others. In 
<BR>
that way they are never really gone.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This sentiment has always bothered me somehow.  I want the person to have 
<BR>
gone on to an afterlife and not simply be 'cherished memories' that in time 
<BR>
will be forgotten.  I remember how as a schoolboy I had a teacher who said 
<BR>
this about a person who had died and I wanted to blurt out how either they 
<BR>
had an afterlife or they were screwed and we were being sentimental fools.  
<BR>
I was seeing things in my own way even back then.
<BR>
<P>With transhumanism and cryonics there is the view that we can actually 
<BR>
'break on through to the other side (thanks Jim!)' and see what life will be 
<BR>
like much down the road, should life-extending medicines not arrive in time 
<BR>
for us.  I am surprised that some list members would talk to you about this 
<BR>
with a rather 'deathist' perspective but I could be accused of that also.
<BR>
<P>Again, I am very sorry about your grandmother.  If it is any consolation I 
<BR>
do believe that in some way she still does exist as a personality.  I 
<BR>
understand what you mean about wanting to know things for absolute certain, 
<BR>
and ending once and for all, the pain, suffering and death in this world.
<BR>
