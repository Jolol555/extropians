<P>When you look into a mirror, J.R., do you see the mirror? How can you study
<BR>
the mirror without looking at it?  And yet I granted in a prior post that the
<BR>
mirror is more than the sum of its reflections.  I said &quot;mirror&quot; [i.e. mind] was
<BR>
a logical construct, an explanatory principle which accounts for what we see
<BR>
we we look into it.
<BR>
<P>That all has to do with the analysis of phenomena.  I also said that &quot;Mind&quot;
<BR>
(unlike the mirror) is the &quot;origin&quot; of thoughts [&quot;Intrapsychic conceptual struc-
<BR>
tures&quot;].  &quot;Thoughts&quot;, in other words, are the &quot;phenomena&quot; of &quot;Mind&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now I agree with you, and the Hellenics -- &quot;gnothi seauton&quot; is a very good
<BR>
thing. But the same reflexive epistemological problems apply here as well.
<BR>
The &quot;self&quot; that looks cannot see itself but only observe itself looking. You
<BR>
want to know that the Mind IS -- everything we know is knowledge of how
<BR>
it APPEARS.
<BR>
<P>But, J.R., I want to know too. So perhaps we might consider asking &quot;Mind&quot;
<BR>
to explain itself? We can add to your question &quot;Why do WE want to know&quot;
<BR>
the question &quot;Does Mind have any interest in knowing itself?&quot;.  WHY has it
<BR>
not done so already, such that &quot;Mind&quot; is a self-evident idea? WHY do we
<BR>
have to ask? WHY is &quot;Mind&quot; not &quot;intuitively obvious&quot;?

<EM>&gt; &quot;I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely odd things about this mailing list. I'm sure you'll agree that there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some truth in what I say.&quot;
