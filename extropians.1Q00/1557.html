<P>
Just got through watching the movie Trainspotting about 3 times. good stuff. 
<BR>
As a cryonicist I of course want to live &quot;forever&quot; in the distant future. 
<BR>
But I often wonder what it will *really* be like then...Maybe the year 
<BR>
1000000 will see us all as the equivalent of today's drug addict, just 
<BR>
living for whatever pleasure our minds can bring us. Hey, it might be 
<BR>
paradise....
<BR>
<P>Concerning some of the other topics that come up on this forum with 
<BR>
regularity, I offer for your amusement and edification the following Usenet 
<BR>
post, posted by a Filpina (female of Philipine descent):
<BR>
<P>&quot;For all you expatriates out there, and you guys who are trying to identify 
<BR>
yourselves with the Philippine experience, I thought you might like to hear 
<BR>
what it's really like to live in the Philippines, straight from the horse's 
<BR>
mouth.  Well, it does smell like a horse's mouth where I am, so you're 
<BR>
getting this as candidly as you can ever hope to get.
<BR>
<P>So.... Where to start...?
<BR>
<P>What about four weeks ago, when I first flew into Manila after years in the 
<BR>
States?
<BR>
<P>Flying in from SFO into Manila at 3 in the morning, my brother picked me up 
<BR>
in his car, and off we went.  I was busy chattering with brother and 
<BR>
sis-in-law when we stopped at an intersection.  I looked up to where the 
<BR>
traffic light was supposed to be, and *I* blinked twice.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The traffic light is not working,&quot; I said, in semi-disbelief.  I have to 
<BR>
say &quot;semi-disbelief&quot; because, probably by instinct, I knew that the way 
<BR>
things work (or don't work) in the Philippines would require you to suspend 
<BR>
all disbelief.
<BR>
<P>My brother, calm as he could be, just grinned at me.  He was looking at the 
<BR>
lights in the cross-flow traffic, which still showed green.  He said, very 
<BR>
matter-of-factly, that once THOSE lights turn red (or maybe I should say, 
<BR>
&quot;cease to be green&quot;), then that means his lane goes.
<BR>
<P>Hmm, I thought, mulling this over.  What a clever idea!  People here 
<BR>
actually save money by just having one set of traffic lights working!
<BR>
<P>We went through another intersection, when I almost jumped off my seat.  
<BR>
&quot;That was a RED LIGHT!&quot; I almost screamed.  &quot;What the hell are you doing 
<BR>
going through a red light??&quot;
<BR>
<P>Once again, my ever-patient brother explained that, hey, it's 3 in the 
<BR>
morning, the traffic is slow, if there are no other cars in the
<BR>
intersection, why should he wait?  And would I please pipe down?  I'm making 
<BR>
him nervous.
<BR>
<P>Then he looked at me and said, &quot;Hey, look.  You've only been here 10 
<BR>
minutes.  It will only get worse.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My brother, the sage, the oracle, he with the tremendous insight.  Or maybe 
<BR>
he has just lived in this city too long.
<BR>
<P>We passed intersections with partially working lights, some with no lights 
<BR>
working at all.  At three in the morning, it's pretty much a free-for-all in 
<BR>
the city, I thought.  Everyone's doing what my brother was: going through 
<BR>
red lights, making what I thought were illegal left- turns, heck, even 
<BR>
making a u-turn in the middle of the street when he decided to go the other 
<BR>
way after all.  At three in the morning, I thought maybe that's acceptable.
<BR>
<P>What is not acceptable is the same thing happening in the middle of the day. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it DID get worse.  Ask anyone here why the traffic lights are not 
<BR>
working, and they'll tell you that the police themselves damage those 
<BR>
lights.  All the better to mulct you with, my dear.  Of course, there's that 
<BR>
infamous episode with the president.  You know, where the traffic aides 
<BR>
stopped his car, not knowing he's in it, and probably tried to intimidate 
<BR>
the driver.  Well, they're suspended, all twelve of them.  Suspended!  For 
<BR>
accepting bribery!  Or actually, the euphemism for suspended nowadays is 
<BR>
&quot;gone for retraining.&quot;  I say put 'em in front of the firing squad, those 
<BR>
jerks!
<BR>
<P>Okay, calm down, calm down.  On with the story....
<BR>
<P>In the middle of the day, you see cars literally inching their way across 
<BR>
traffic to be able to cross a busy intersection or make a left turn.  That 
<BR>
means that, lane by lane, the cars stop to let these guys cross/turn.  
<BR>
Jeepneys stop in the middle of the road to load or unload passengers.  Buses 
<BR>
do the same.  Tricycle drivers pretty much stop anywhere they want.  If 
<BR>
you're wondering where the traffic cops are, look under the nearest leafy 
<BR>
tree (our version of Dunkin' Donuts). There they are, cooling themselves; 
<BR>
maybe it's too hot to stand in the middle of the street in the middle of the 
<BR>
day to direct traffic.  Heck, we're only paying them to work; noone's put a 
<BR>
knife to their necks yet.
<BR>
<P>The traffic would be okay (okay, I'm delirious), I guess, if it were not for 
<BR>
the pollution.  Imagine Los Angeles in the 70's, and you get Manila on a 
<BR>
really good day.  I have not seen a tricycle that doesn't emit those little 
<BR>
white clouds that stay close to the ground.  Go to UP Village, at ten in the 
<BR>
evening, and you'll see this bluish-white haze that seems to cling to 
<BR>
everything.  UP Diliman is not much better anymore, either.  UP, that haven 
<BR>
of Sunday morning joggers, with the clean fresh air, dewy grass and majestic 
<BR>
trees; at 6 in the morning, you'll see that same bluish-white haze that 
<BR>
seems to shroud the entire place.  &quot;It's fog,&quot; you would say, almost 
<BR>
praying.  Well, snap out of it.  It's smog of the worst order.  No one jogs 
<BR>
around Quezon Circle anymore;  it's dirty, the grass is unkempt, and I 
<BR>
spotted squatters' shanties there.
<BR>
<P>Oh, for you smokers out there, you don't have to bring your cigars when you 
<BR>
come to visit Manila.  All you have to do is breathe in the stale air that 
<BR>
envelops this city.  You'll get lung cancer just the same. Saves you money, 
<BR>
too, I bet.
<BR>
<P>The jeepneys are even worse.  Black smoke comes out of their
<BR>
tailpipes.  In California, try driving around with the smallest hint of 
<BR>
smog, and you're dead.  So if you're Californian, psyche yourself, before 
<BR>
flying into Manila, and say that smog ain't too bad.  Because you'll get it 
<BR>
from everywhere.  I don't blame the folks out here for trying to get their 
<BR>
own cars.  Air-conditioned cars are the way to go. You'll be stuck in 
<BR>
traffic anyway; at least you can try to filter out the bad air.
<BR>
<P>Oh, and in case you're wondering, I've had this nasty cough for four weeks 
<BR>
now.  Bronchial diseases seem to be prevalent in this city.  I haven't seen 
<BR>
politicians coughing on TV, though.  I say, get them to give up those 
<BR>
air-conditioned cars, and get them to go around the city like the rest of 
<BR>
the common folks.  Maybe they'll have more incentive to change things for 
<BR>
the better.
<BR>
<P>Sidewalks have all but disappeared in many parts of the city, taken over by 
<BR>
homeowners.  You know how it goes: they build little rooms or stores on 
<BR>
their sidewalks.  I know of whole streets that have
<BR>
disappeared, squatters' shanties appearing in the middle of them.  The city 
<BR>
streets, already pretty small, also have on-street parking. Sometimes on 
<BR>
both sides of the street!  One Way Street signs are laughable; I think they 
<BR>
don't require new drivers to learn what those signs mean.
<BR>
<P>Pedestrians cross wherever they want; who's ever heard of zebra
<BR>
crossings or pedestrian lanes anyway?  And the streets don't have those 
<BR>
little yellow lines that say, &quot;You on the right lane, stay on your lane and 
<BR>
don't cross this line.&quot;  I remember going down Commonwealth Avenue, which is 
<BR>
an eight-lane road, with two lanes on each side going up a flyover.  Well, I 
<BR>
almost fell off my seat when I saw the innermost lane filled with cars going 
<BR>
the direction opposite to where it should be leading.  Hmm, I thought.  How 
<BR>
enterprising; they couldn't make a left turn because there are islands, so 
<BR>
they just take over one of those lanes.  Oh, and yes, there was a traffic 
<BR>
aide directing them towards a left turn.
<BR>
<P>If anything, Manila must have produced some of the best drivers (okay, maybe 
<BR>
worst, depends on the perspective) ever.  With the traffic jams and the 
<BR>
gung-ho drivers, I still have to see a car wreck.
<BR>
<P>And the garbage....
<BR>
<P>Maybe it's because I lived in the Midwest for a while.  Maybe because 
<BR>
Northern California is so heavenly.  Maybe because Oregon is pristine. Maybe 
<BR>
because I thought Chicago was dirty....
<BR>
<P>This place is filthy.  Chicago had cigarette butts on the streets, and I 
<BR>
thought that disgusting.  Well, welcome to Manila.  Garbage, garbage 
<BR>
everywhere.  I think that people here have not heard of garbage cans. Or 
<BR>
maybe they don't know how to use them.  I think that in the big streets of 
<BR>
Makati, this might still be okay; I did espy some garbage cans there, and 
<BR>
not much garbage.  But let's talk about the rest of Manila.
<BR>
<P>Quezon City, where I unhappily live, is REALLY BAD.  There are little piles 
<BR>
of garbage everywhere.  Like I said, this place is filthy. Cockroaches are 
<BR>
ubiquitous.  It makes you wonder what is the use of keeping your apartment 
<BR>
rid of cockroaches when the folks next door run a cockroach farm.
<BR>
<P>I did see some mice and rats, too.  People don't think twice about throwing 
<BR>
their garbage on the street.  Eat a candy, and just toss the wrapper over 
<BR>
your shoulder.  Cigarette smokers, same thing.  In some places the garbage 
<BR>
trucks come every week, others every two weeks.  And as for others, well, I 
<BR>
don't think they know what a garbage truck looks like.  As one potential 
<BR>
landlady said, you can just give your bag of garbage to one of those kids 
<BR>
running around the street, hand him five pesos, and he'll take care of it.  
<BR>
I asked where will he take it?  She shrugged and said no one knows.
<BR>
<P>Two or three weeks ago, politicians were decrying on TV how there are too 
<BR>
few toilets in the Philippines.  Toilets For the Poor is the slogan.  Makes 
<BR>
you wonder just what kind of stuff are floating in the rivers right now.  
<BR>
Oh, by the way, if you want a sure way to kill yourself, jump into the Pasig 
<BR>
River.  Even the fishes die there.  And the politicians?  Not a peep since 
<BR>
they got their free publicity. Which is pretty typical.
<BR>
<P>This is mad.  Every year, the city is flooded when monsoon season sweeps 
<BR>
over us.  Everyone cries out that it's because the sewers are filled with 
<BR>
garbage, that people should stop tossing garbage there, that someone has to 
<BR>
clean the esteros.  The rains stop, the floods abate, and it's back to the 
<BR>
old habit of throwing garbage into the canals, and doing nothing much about 
<BR>
them.  It's so mad it's obscene. It's a charade we play, year in and year 
<BR>
out.  We don't move forward, we regress.  We are too fond of using masking 
<BR>
tape to cover the holes; we never really fix the problem, we just patch it.  
<BR>
Garbage collection is a problem?  Create more landfills.  Heck, we're even 
<BR>
helping the poor because we're providing jobs for them.  You know, the &quot;go 
<BR>
up Smoky Mountain and find some treasures&quot; kind of job.  Traffic lights 
<BR>
aren't working?  Field more cops!  Who cares if they don't do as good a job? 
<BR>
The traffic lights will blink out again anyway, so what's the use of fixing 
<BR>
it?
<BR>
<P>The bad news, Virginia, is that traffic and garbage is not the worst of our 
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I almost died laughing when I saw one of the headlines in the 
<BR>
papers the other day:  Fault Spotted Near Subic Bay.  I thought, &quot;Estrada 
<BR>
must be out of town again.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You've heard his pronouncements lately?
<BR>
<P>- Why should I increase wages when oil price increases if I don't reduce 
<BR>
wages when oil price falls?
<BR>
<P>- Foreign airlines are more efficient and drive down prices, putting 
<BR>
Philippine Airlines in jeopardy, so we should do something about it, like 
<BR>
keeping those airlines from ferrying people to and from the Philippines and 
<BR>
thus save Philippine Airlines.
<BR>
<P>- By scrapping the amelioration pay, we save 10 billion pesos, which is good 
<BR>
because we have a budget deficit of 80 billion pesos.  What?  So what if I 
<BR>
have a personal pork barrel of 60 billion?  That's for the good of country 
<BR>
because I'm pro-poor.
<BR>
<P>Okay, so I've taken liberties in transcribing them, but that's pretty much 
<BR>
what he means.
<BR>
<P>The point is where is the indignant outcry?  Where are the people saying, 
<BR>
&quot;Enough is enough&quot;?  Except for a small minority who reads and writes for 
<BR>
the newspapers, people hardly care.
<BR>
<P>This is Animal Farm.  We're like those clueless animals who just take on 
<BR>
whatever the ruling pigs say.  Blearily, we look at the barn wall, and we 
<BR>
read, &quot;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than 
<BR>
others.&quot;  And we think, hmm, maybe that's the way it's always been, that's 
<BR>
the way it always will be, now and forever, Amen.
<BR>
<P>Maybe we're too nice.  Maybe we smile too much.  Maybe we're too myopic in 
<BR>
thinking that my brother's garbage isn't mine, so who cares?  It's the 
<BR>
cultural attitude, I think, that is our biggest problem.  We don't look 
<BR>
towards changing anything when we're on top, or when we're not directly 
<BR>
affected by what's going on.  Who cares about the traffic if we're riding in 
<BR>
an air-conditioned car?  Or as long as we get to work? And we pat the 
<BR>
resourceful jeepney driver on the back when he goes through some little 
<BR>
streets and gets us to our destination a full 10 minutes ahead.  Who cares 
<BR>
if the traffic got just a little bit worse? Especially when the rest of the 
<BR>
jeepney drivers followed suit?
<BR>
<P>Who cares about traffic rules?  If I can cross the intersection a full 10 
<BR>
seconds before I'm supposed to, then that's good.  Who cares if the light 
<BR>
was still red?  The cops aren't looking anyway.  And if they were, what are 
<BR>
a few pesos changing hands illicitly?
<BR>
<P>Who cares if the canals are clogged?  If I can keep my house rid of garbage, 
<BR>
does it matter if I throw the garbage into the estero just like everyone 
<BR>
else?  THEN it would be the government's problem, or someone else's anyway, 
<BR>
not mine.
<BR>
<P>Who cares if the politicians are corrupt?  They promised us another raise 
<BR>
next year.  That will help feed the family.  Why should I write letters to 
<BR>
my congressman and complain about the awful living
<BR>
conditions here?  Who cares if they have huge pork barrels when the rest of 
<BR>
the country is starving?  A few pesos will come my way, so that's all right.
<BR>
<P>And I put up my hand in frustration, because I see the same attitude prevail 
<BR>
among friends and family.  If they can get away with a little bit, they're 
<BR>
happy, they feel smart, they're smug.  If someone else puts one over them, 
<BR>
they start cursing, and vowing they'll get even, and get more.
<BR>
<P>To characterize the Filipino mentality to my befuddled foreign friend, I 
<BR>
said, &quot;You'll never meet a people who are so willing to help you, and so 
<BR>
ready to rob you when they get a chance.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And so we spiral down the drain.  I am afraid for the next generations of 
<BR>
this country.  We learn from our elders.  What we do learn scares the hell 
<BR>
out of me.  We learn to be street smart, to make sure no one puts one over 
<BR>
us, to take advantage of a situation when we can.  My friend swerved into 
<BR>
traffic one time, and his three-year-old chided him.  &quot;Daddy, you can't do 
<BR>
that!&quot;  But do it often enough, and the child will believe it's okay.
<BR>
<P>And that's the end of the story.  I've only been here four weeks after all.  
<BR>
The worst part, really, is that after a while, you stop even thinking about 
<BR>
what's wrong with this place.  You stop minding the garbage and the 
<BR>
pollution.  The traffic lights just become another impediment in your 
<BR>
journey towards wherever you're going.  You start to see the shortcuts, 
<BR>
literally and figuratively.  Government is there to assist you, legally or 
<BR>
otherwise.  And you become inured to the whole experience, to the filth and 
<BR>
chaos of Manila.  Someone complains about the traffic, and you look around 
<BR>
and say, &quot;What traffic?  It really isn't so bad....&quot;
<BR>
<P>THAT, my friends, is why we have not risen above this morass of
<BR>
incompetence and stupidity.  That is why seeing those cops on the street 
<BR>
corners just makes my brother shrug and say, &quot;They need some money for 
<BR>
snacks.&quot;  That is why when our president makes those laughable 
<BR>
pronouncements, people just say, &quot;Well, what can we do?&quot;  And that is why we 
<BR>
learn to live with cockroaches and rats, both the ones who go through our 
<BR>
garbage, and the ones who spew garbage on TV.
<BR>
<P>And THAT is Manila from a repatriate's point of view.  If I had any more 
<BR>
balls (anatomically impossible, I know, being female... or so I claim), I 
<BR>
would write to the newspapers about this.  But why tell them something they 
<BR>
already know?
<BR>
<P>So here I am, relating to you, my loud and vociferous fellow Filipinos and 
<BR>
Filipinos-in-law, mostly abroad and, if you're in the Philippines, probably 
<BR>
cooped in your ivory towers.  I am telling you exactly what I think is wrong 
<BR>
with your beloved, benighted Fatherland.  I dare you to come home and think 
<BR>
of something to change the country for the better. Believe me, this is a 
<BR>
country that needs all the help it can get. &quot;
<BR>
<P>So, what is the difference between 1st and 3rd world?
