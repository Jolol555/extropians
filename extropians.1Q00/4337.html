However, this is also cited as a reason for divorce, as it was for Kathy 
<BR>
Meyer of Palo Alto, Calif.  She divorced her husband (not named) after he 
<BR>
ventured into low-wage nonprofit work, while she took a well-paid corporate 
<BR>
job.  Both have MBA degrees from Stanford University.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Wow!  That is really something!  At least she was honest about it.  Many 
<BR>
women don't marry men they otherwise probably would if the man only made 
<BR>
more money, so why not divorce them when they fail to deliver on a promising 
<BR>
college major that came from a top school.
<BR>
<P>I bet if his major in college had been education or social work she would 
<BR>
have never married him in the first place!  I remember reading how in a 
<BR>
study, female med students in their last year were asked why they went after 
<BR>
men as mates who were also going to be doctors
<BR>
instead of going for men in less well paid careers.
<BR>
<P>The women replied that they wanted a man as educated and especially as 
<BR>
cultured as they were.  The author found this remark rather strange and 
<BR>
considered it largely a case of self-deceit.  What the women really wanted 
<BR>
the author felt was a mate who made comparable money.  But this was not just 
<BR>
to have more financial power as a couple but to feel they could respect the 
<BR>
husband as an equal.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
