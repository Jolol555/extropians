<P>I translated the following text into kind of English.  If you don't find a
<BR>
particular word in your dictionary, either the authorof the text below used
<BR>
a neologism (you know, those words which only nice academics may create in
<BR>
the English language ;-) or I simply made a miztake in xlation.
<BR>
<P>[See comment at end for known neologisms.]

As spending time in both hacker- and fan-dom I guess I would agree that we
<BR>
are not as careful with the formalities as with the contents. For those that
<BR>
mainly converse as a part of their social behaviour and practise talking a lot,
<BR>
the ritual itself probably becomes more important, to the extent that *how*
<BR>
you say something sometimes becomes more information carrying than *what* you
<BR>
say.  What is so liberating with groups that have real interests, like hackers
<BR>
and sf-fans do, is of course that what they say means exactly what they
<BR>
mean and nothing else. Since in most cases there is so much information that
<BR>
needs to be communicated, there is no time for fine social games and cake
<BR>
decorations.  That is why slightly autistic people may have easier to interact
<BR>
in such groups than in the 'mundane', as they don't have to learn an extra
<BR>
presupposed code which, in addition, varies wildly from one culture to another,
<BR>
and instead what is said contains all the given information.
<BR>
<P>Diction.. well, surely it will vary between different languages, but it may
<BR>
be conceivable that if one mainly communicate writingly then one surely, with
<BR>
time, will get a somewhat different pronounciation than those who mainly
<BR>
yak in phones, and those in turn may sound different from those who mainly yak
<BR>
without a medium. I would imagine the choice of words ozo becomes different
<BR>
depending on if it is important to promore hear- or readability.
<BR>
<P>Body language.. I don't know how much Swedish hackers and sf-fans use their
<BR>
lips more than the rest of their interfaces, but I would assume that if they
<BR>
do that, it would more be a sign of the modern sound-environment than some kind
<BR>
of regression back to the baby stage. (Or remaining on, really.)  One
<BR>
articulates wildly so it can be seen what one says if it cannot be heard.
<BR>
Either out in the city or in rooms where everybody gabble at the same time -
<BR>
does the old lady really mean that people in general wait out each other like
<BR>
Texans at a street crossing, even in greater groups?
<BR>
<P>Eye contact on the other hand was interesting.. I have never really believed
<BR>
in people staying and staring at each others' eyes the whole time while they
<BR>
yak - it seems impolite. It might an American phenomenon or sumthin.. not all
<BR>
Americans, however, since random indians are supposed to look somebody in the
<BR>
eyes only if they doubt what the person in question says - if one is to believe
<BR>
Zelazny at least, but one would expect him to have studied the subject. But
<BR>
she really means that they do that, and then look away to hand over the floor?
<BR>
Weird.. it seems a lot more natural to do the opposite. Otherwise one looks
<BR>
people in the eyes only if one is angry at them (like most cats [...]). Or
<BR>
when filled up as one's eye sight becomes somewhat fuzzy..  OK, one can also
<BR>
do that to flirt with somebdy, but then we probably fall into rather mundane
<BR>
code systems.

<P>0. writingly - in writing
<BR>
1. ozo - also
<BR>
2. Zelazny - Roger Zelazny (1937-1995), science fiction/fantasy writer.
<BR>
3. filled up - intoxicated
