<EM>&gt; &gt; The anti-gunners have not been able to disprove any of his conclusions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with their own study. The best they can do is cherry pick 5 (count em:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 5) counties in the US where their claims held up for short periods, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those abberrations John Lott has shown were entirely due to single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crimes (spree killings).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Usually these arguments don't get as far as the cherry basket.  Lott did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his analysis while at U.Chicago on a visiting scholarship funded by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Olin Foundation, which has ancestral links to the Olin Corporation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which makes ammo (among other things?); so the fascists crow that Lott
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is &quot;a paid whore for the death industry,&quot; and smugly retire from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; field.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Never mind that the Olin Foundation (let alone the Olin Corporation)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exercises no control over the scholarship.  The appointment is in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands of people in the Chicago economics faculty.  The previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incumbent, David Friedman (who was on this list once upon a time), says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he met someone from Olin exactly once, at a banquet or some such; she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked what he was working on, and blanched a bit when he told her the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefits of legalizing heroin (or some such thing), but said nothing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, Anton, Thank YOU VERY MUCH. That is such a sweet bit to retort with
<BR>
whenever they try to bring this up.
