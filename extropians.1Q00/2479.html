<EM>&gt;&gt; Robert J. Bradbury
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Anders Sandberg
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; So if people want to send me &quot;concise&quot; questions of things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; even *we* don't know the answers to, perhaps we could organize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; them, &quot;vote&quot; on their importance and then publish this on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Web site.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A good idea!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is; or at least organizing topics and responses is.  In fact I
<BR>
almost suggested such a thing recently with regard to the singularity
<BR>
concept.  Since there are several scenarios, technologies, and expectations
<BR>
connected with the notion it might be useful to state them clearly.  Several
<BR>
sites, though, do state the basic notions and the popular variants; the
<BR>
details can be explored as separate topics.
<BR>
<P>In a discussion, though, it is useful to know the positions of the
<BR>
participants.  Yes, you observe their positions over time; but positions
<BR>
change, subtly or otherwise, and they're not exactly all in one convenient
<BR>
place.  It can be useful not only for informing newcomers to the list but
<BR>
also for clarifying general discussion.  This is basically one of the things
<BR>
mentioned in the &quot;Debate Failure&quot; posts last month.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Is the development of a more capable form of intelligence in a given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment an easy or a hard problem? Are there limits in principe to what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forms of intelligence a group of intelligent entities can produce? Are all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forms of intelligent processing equivalent?
</EM><BR>
<P>And more generally, what are the possible forms of intelligence?  What is,
<BR>
as Aaron Sloman has put it, the structure of the space of possible minds?
<BR>
And more specifically, what are the possibilities and limitations of
<BR>
development once a mind is uploaded (i.e., of a self-modifying and flexible
<BR>
mind)?  These are obviously profound questions (and not ones that we'll
<BR>
solve casually here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Does the functionalist view of the mind hold (and hence uploading is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feasible)?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is, I think, a matter of great concern which has not been completely
<BR>
resolved.  Debates such as those in the philosophy of mind literature must be
<BR>
turned to this problem.
<BR>
<P>Some others?
<BR>
<P>Intellectual property/patents issues (previously discussed here).
<BR>
<P>The future of privacy and the technology involved.
<BR>
<P>Detailed design-ahead strategies for nanotech (development, security,
<BR>
applications).
<BR>
<P>. . .
