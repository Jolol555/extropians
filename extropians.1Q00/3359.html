'What is your name?'  'hal@finney.org.'  'Do you deny having written the 
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems by this definition that you either don't perceive qualia, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only perceive qualia and nothing else.  You can't say that you perceive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flowers and that you perceive qualia, because one is the mechanism by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which you accomplish the other.  Saying that you perceive both qualia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and flowers sounds like a misuse of &quot;perceive&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;trivia&gt; This very argument is the one Berkeley attempted to use to
<BR>
disprove the existence of mind-independent flowers.  All we perceive, he
<BR>
argued, are sense impressions, or ideas.  For something to exist, it must
<BR>
be conceivable in the mind.  But if we conceive of something, we're just
<BR>
imagining a sense impression or an idea, (imagining, say, the visual sense
<BR>
impression of the flower, or it's smell, etc.)  Thus, everything that is
<BR>
conceivable is a sense impression, and thus, everything is an idea.
<BR>
Objects have permanence, according to Berkeley, only because God has these
<BR>
ideas in his mind as well.&lt;/trivia&gt;
<BR>
<P>It might be rather difficult to accept the idea that you only have access
<BR>
to qualia without falling into idealism, which claims that only ideas
<BR>
exist.  At best you'll reach a stage where all you know of are ideas, but
<BR>
nonetheless you can't help but believe that there's this strange
<BR>
unknowable world beyond your qualia, something totally unlike your sense
<BR>
impressions of it.  (For how could that world be &quot;like&quot; your sensations of
<BR>
it?  In particular, which properties would they share?)
<BR>
<P>If this isn't your picture of what the world is like, a qualia-based
<BR>
metaphysical picture may not be for you.
