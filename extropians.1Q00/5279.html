<EM>&gt; This raises a raises lots of questions in my mind....  [Its early,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can be over the edge].
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) What is the photonic density required to create a black hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and do any of the principles of photon interaction prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    this from focusing laser beams to produce a black hole?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    [I may have asked this before, but I'm too lazy to go check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     the archives.]
</EM><BR>
<P>The numbers are a long ways out there- you'd need yoctosecond pulses of
<BR>
yottajoule energy, focused into picometer volumes.  Eeek!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; b) If you have particles (electrons, protons, etc.) circulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in a syncrotron, emitting syncrotron radiation, shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    they eventually &quot;evaporate&quot; into nothing?  Or is it always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    true that the photons they are emitting get replenished by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the external power source?
</EM><BR>
<P>Synchrotron radiation is pulled from the kinetic energy of an
<BR>
accelerated charged particle, but the rest mass is unaffected.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; c) Why do astronomers, esp. X-ray astronomers, often quote the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    temperatures of gas clouds in &quot;millions&quot; of degrees?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    atom/molecule densities are on the order of a few per cc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I don't see how you can get temperatures like this.  Temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    corresponds to vibration or molecule velocity, but what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the relationship between ionization state and temperature?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Is the effect of increasing temperature -- atom ionization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    then acceleration of the ions?  If so, then what would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the &quot;temperature&quot; of an electron gas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Temperature is just a measure of the average kinetic energy of a medium,
<BR>
so as it is ionized, the average molecular weight goes down- for
<BR>
instance, hydrogen gas has MW of 2 (one mole of H2), atomic hydrogen is
<BR>
MW 1 (two moles of H), and ionized the MW is .5 (2 moles p+, 2 moles
<BR>
e-).  The electron velocities are about 43x that of the protons, since
<BR>
the ratio of masses is 1846.  If they are in thermal contact with the
<BR>
protons, they are all at the same temperature despite having different
<BR>
velocities.
<BR>
<P>Temperature is unrelated to density, only to kinetic energy per unit
<BR>
mass.  Low density gas clouds can be far from equilibrium if the energy
<BR>
is pumped up by an external source and the radiative processes are
<BR>
inefficient- thus the solar wind is very hot, but the planets immersed
<BR>
in it are much cooler.  The thin hot plasma is essentially transparent,
<BR>
and cools only very slowly because ion-electron interactions are rare,
<BR>
and must occur to allow the gas to cool by radiation.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'ver glossed over a lot of details, but I hope this gives you the
<BR>
idea...
