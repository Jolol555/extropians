Robert Bradbury on discussing locations for an extro writes:
<BR>
It also has merits I can't think of a better group than Extropians to 
<BR>
encourage those with an Arab/Moslem mentality to come to grips with some of 
<BR>
their dysfunctional traditions.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>You are going to get us all killed!!  I can just see it where you and other 
<BR>
extropians are explaining how illogical Arabic/Islamic ways are in your view 
<BR>
when all of a sudden these &quot;westernized&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; Arabs have a 
<BR>
knee-jerk reaction and we all get stoned to death or shot!!  Be careful, 
<BR>
Robert.

We could plan ahead, if Zyvex pushes up nanotech a bit we might be able to 
<BR>
fly our air cars there ourselves, rather than trying to book 250 extropians 
<BR>
onto a single plane flight
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Now that is a flight of fancy that appeals to me!  We could camp out under 
<BR>
the stars!  It would be the equivalent of an extropian boy scout jamboree! 
<BR>
:)  Max, how about starting up an organization called the &quot;Extroscouts!&quot;
<BR>
<P>I truly dream about owning a Moller aircar.  I want to be FREE to go where I 
<BR>
want, compared to how things are now.  I am tired of feeling a slave of high 
<BR>
airline ticket prices or LONG drives in a car.  Just as alot of young people 
<BR>
now can't imagine a world without the internet, I bet twenty years from now 
<BR>
many won't be able to imagine things without an aircar in just about every 
<BR>
garage.
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
