<EM>&gt; Dan replied:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;True enough, but we'll never HAVE a magic wand like this. The prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would surely affect my way of thinking about ethics, so the prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would have to not only model my thoughts on the matter but its own effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on my thoughts on the matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course.  This is what economists do with &quot;game theory&quot;, and philosophers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do with &quot;reflective equilibrium&quot;.  But I don't see why this is a criticism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the evol-psych approach.  Why is it so hard to imagine that once we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand in more detail where our ethical feelings come from and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pliable they are that we could reach an equilibrium where we are at peace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with and accept those feelings, and the limited degree we have bent them?
</EM><BR>
<P>As I mentioned earlier, I don't criticize evol-psych as an approach to
<BR>
psych, but as an answer to ethics.  Many of these thinkers seem to think
<BR>
that by doing sociobiology or evol-psych or cog sci or whatever they can
<BR>
sidestep the problem of ethics, as Darin implied, in much the same way
<BR>
that we sidestep the philosophy of mind.
<BR>
<P>I could definitely hear some kind of an argument that a sound brain theory
<BR>
will have an impact on my ethical theory (though I could also hear a
<BR>
counterargument; the claim isn't obviously right to me), but that places
<BR>
the argument firmly *within* ethics.  Again, not a problem if you've got
<BR>
your head on tight, but too much of the so-called &quot;third culture&quot; turns up
<BR>
their nose at this kind of discussion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Not to mention problems like Newcomb's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Paradox, etc.  This problem gets harder still if I never die, friggin'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impossible if I ever make it to some Omega point, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't understand the relevance of these considerations.
</EM><BR>
<P>These considerations were meant to hint at what will make it so difficult
<BR>
to predict my ethical choices in the manner you described.  But you
<BR>
already knew that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;And, if that didn't convince you, on a practical level this problem is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;harder than trying to predict the high/lows in temperature and when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will rain from now until my death (if ever) based solely on a few weather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;vanes in Paraguay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why must ethics be so prone to a &quot;butterfly effect&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ethics needn't be; predicting my ethical beliefs based on my current
<BR>
beliefs probably is, especially if I live a long time, if I'll change my
<BR>
beliefs on the basis of the prediction, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Must it really be something that we feel compelled to change whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we seem to be reaching an equilibrium?
</EM><BR>
<P>Some days I'm a cynic.  ;)
