Cell Generates Electricity From Ordinary Fuels
<BR>
By David Morgan
<BR>
<P>PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A tiny experimental fuel cell could lead to a 
<BR>
gleaming new horizon of clean energy that relies on fuels no more exotic than 
<BR>
the gasoline that runs the family car, researchers said Wednesday.
<BR>
<P>While policy-makers worldwide struggle to cope with pollution problems caused 
<BR>
by dirty and wasteful methods of energy production using combustion, 
<BR>
scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, who invented the device, say 
<BR>
their creation could be lighting homes within 10 years.
<BR>
<P>Their ultimate aim is to construct a prototype for fuel cells that can be 
<BR>
used to power buses, trucks and automobiles in coming decades.
<BR>
<P>The Penn fuel cell, less than a square centimeter (0.4 square inch) in size 
<BR>
and constructed from inexpensive materials, has proven capable of converting 
<BR>
the hydrocarbon molecules of diesel, gasoline, methane and butane into 
<BR>
electricity without producing dangerous fumes.
<BR>
<P>No Smoking
<BR>
<P>Aside from electricity and heat, the experimental cell produced only water 
<BR>
and carbon dioxide. Details of the breakthrough appeared in the journal 
<BR>
Nature.
<BR>
<P>``Until now, it has been said that any fuel will work in a fuel cell as long 
<BR>
as the fuel is hydrogen,'' said Raymond Gorte, a chemical engineering 
<BR>
professor at Penn who helped construct the device as part of a study funded 
<BR>
by the Chicago-based Gas Research Institute.
<BR>
<P>Hydrogen has proven too costly and too dangerous for widespread use. While 
<BR>
earlier studies have successfully generated electricity from methane, the 
<BR>
Penn project has developed an energy cell far more versatile and effective 
<BR>
than anything seen up to now.
<BR>
<P>Scientists view the electrochemical conversion process used by fuel cells as 
<BR>
the latest and most sophisticated juncture in an evolution of energy 
<BR>
technology that has led humankind from wood to coal to oil.
<BR>
<P>``By the end of the century, these fiery combustion processes may be 
<BR>
banned,'' warned Kevin Kendall of Britain's University of Birmingham, who 
<BR>
wrote an article in Nature accompanying the Penn team's results.
<BR>
<P>``Even now the trend is apparent: smoking is frowned upon; fires in forests 
<BR>
are not permitted; dirty vehicles are penalized; and a new regulation has 
<BR>
appeared in (Germany) defining ten parts per million of nitrogen oxides as 
<BR>
the upper level of effluent from fossil-fuel burners.''
<BR>
<P>High-Tech Battery
<BR>
<P>The Penn fuel cell is a kind of high-tech battery that combines oxygen and 
<BR>
hydrocarbon molecules to produce enough free electrons to generate 
<BR>
electricity. Unlike a battery, however, it does not run down or need 
<BR>
recharging as long as it is supplied with fuel.
<BR>
<P>Earlier versions ran into trouble because the electrochemical process caused 
<BR>
a buildup of carbon that soon ruined the cell. But the Penn team overcame the 
<BR>
problem by substituting different materials, for example, using a Cu-ceria 
<BR>
composite instead of zirconia for the cell's anode.
<BR>
<P>As a result, the cell was able to generate one-tenth of a kilowatt of 
<BR>
electricity and remain in operation for four days. The process occurred at a 
<BR>
temperature of 700 degrees C (1,292 F). Gorte said that equaled only half the 
<BR>
amount of heat used in combustion.
<BR>
<P>Gorte also said it would be some time before the fuel cell could be made 
<BR>
small enough and cheap enough for use in the automotive world.
<BR>
<P>But a portable generator for vacation cottages could be envisioned over the 
<BR>
next five to 10 years, he said, with larger units capable of powering 
<BR>
individual homes following shortly thereafter.
<BR>
<P>``It's much more efficient to produce the electricity on-site than it is to 
<BR>
make it miles away,'' he said.
