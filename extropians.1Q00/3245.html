<P><EM>&gt;I know the general consensus is that GM food is OK.  But the same &gt; &gt;thing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought about such things as cigarette smoking, silicone breasts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thalydomide (sp?) once upon a time.  Sure maybe GM stuff is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harmless, but my goal is long life.  I ain't taking any chances ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Thalidomide: As Jeff points out in another post, it has been shown to be a 
<BR>
beneficial drug in some instances.  Too bad it was completely banned for so 
<BR>
long.
<BR>
<P>Smoking: I don't advocate smoking, but it is worth noting that smokers 
<BR>
almost never get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.  Also, as has been 
<BR>
discussed on this list, nicotine has been shown to be a potent nootropic.  I 
<BR>
can even remember consuming a Red Bull-type energy drink in Myanmar a couple 
<BR>
years ago, which had nicotine as an ingredient.
<BR>
<P>Silicon breast implants, which is what I think you were referring to with 
<BR>
your comment about &quot;silicone breasts&quot;:  What makes you think silicon breast 
<BR>
implants are harmful, on a par with smoking?  Just because some trial 
<BR>
lawyers and non-scientist juries have said so?  In fact, I have yet to see 
<BR>
compelling scientific evidence that this is the case, and I'm not aware that 
<BR>
such was presented in any of those lawsuits against Dow.  If anyone on this 
<BR>
list has such, I would love to see it.  As far as I can tell, the massive 
<BR>
litigation over these implants has been one of the greatest legal plunders 
<BR>
of our time.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes to all,
<BR>
<P>Bill
