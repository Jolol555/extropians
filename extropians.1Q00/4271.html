<EM>&gt; Perhaps call to order driverless vehicles that come to your door step,

<EM>&gt; travel a ways and join up with a mass of others going the same direction,

<EM>&gt; then branch off to your destination where other passengers take that same

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering how Americans love to control(drive) their own vehicles, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be a very hard thing to get them to do!! lol  In areas like L.A. where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gridlock is bad I could see the public in frustration possibly going for it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The moller skycar would take control from the passenger and this could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;roadblock&quot; to the public eagerly accepting it.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a lot of things Americans and others will gradually give up without
<BR>
much protest in trade for convenience. We have already. As time becomes more of
<BR>
a premium some might welcome not having to do the driving, using the time to
<BR>
check their investments with their wearable mobile office.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; James, the scenario you gave of skycars crashing into people on the ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is frightening and yet each year in the U.S. about fifty-thousand people die
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in car accidents!  And a large percentage involving the abuse of drugs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alcohol.  I see skycars being safer then that!  Especially with automatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controls guided by gps.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well it's scary as long as vehicles are unreliable enough to crash. I'm stating
<BR>
the obvious but we are a long way from the kind of reliability needed for sky
<BR>
cars. Automobiles for the most part crash on roads. Sometimes they careen into a
<BR>
house but it's rare statistically. Airplanes sometime hit houses but again rare
<BR>
statistically. This threatens to change if the air traffic increases to the
<BR>
level Moller dreams of. Ever see &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;? What a nightmare of air
<BR>
traffic portrayed there!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have a friend here in Anchorage who is a pilot of many years experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he also has serious reservations about the moller skycar similar to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own.  He basically thought they were cool looking deathtraps! lol
</EM><BR>
<P>I used to build planes and I patched up jets in the airforce. I think the Moller
<BR>
sky car looks really neat, kind of Buck Rogers, but it looks like it is trying
<BR>
to defy physics. I must question where it gets enough power for the thrust
<BR>
needed to be truly VTOL. I'd like it better if it's fans and engines rotated
<BR>
rather than tried to deflect the air for downward thrust. In either case, the
<BR>
most dangerous point of VTOL flight is transition from hover to forward flight.
<BR>
At lower altitudes and o forward speed there is no recovery space or time if an
<BR>
engine shuts down. His car looks like it is pushing it in the first place as far
<BR>
as having enough thrust to overcome it's weight. I don't see how it could
<BR>
survive the loss of even one engine let alone more at transition stage. Even a
<BR>
balistic parachute will be hard pressed to dploy properely if a problem occurs
<BR>
at low altitude.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Certainly, there would have to be serious changes in the nature of air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic and it's monitoring to make things safe.  It may be a number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decades till we see skycars constantly zooming overhead.
</EM><BR>
<P>No one more than me want's individual vertical flight. I have several designs of
<BR>
my own. I'm just a little leary of having Mr. Public en masse running around in
<BR>
the skys. I am aware, however, of the virtual highways in the sky and gps
<BR>
guidence, etc. But what happens when a satelite gets taken out by a micro meteor
<BR>
or a missing bolt left behind from another satelite or maybe a solar flare?
<BR>
Oops!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have read that Dr. Moller is going to do serious flight trials this year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I look forward to hearing how they go.  When Nasa, the military and the FBI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc, start using moller skycars I will know that it is just a matter of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; till the public gets them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't wait to see the results of his tests. I guess at bottom I am just
<BR>
skeptical of Mollers design more than I am of the concept of flying cars. It's
<BR>
been a pet dream of my own since childhood when I used to try in a stiff wind to
<BR>
land my Piper J3 Cub nearly vertically tiptoeing near the edge of stall speed.
<BR>
Whew! The things I've done! ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Like with cryonics, despite any bad news I am an optimist and want to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technology out when it is the right time for me and the kinks have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked out.  And just think, with our skycars it won't be such a big deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to an extro!  As long as you're an American citizen, of course(yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Charlie Stross! lol).
</EM><BR>
<P>I too will stay optimistic, cautiously optimistic. ;)
