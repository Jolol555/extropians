I learned a lot from his classic &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; in my teens. Another 
<BR>
incredible repository of wisdom gone forever. Every time I hear of another 
<BR>
intellectual influence dying, I get yet more frustrated with our culture's 
<BR>
failure to make ending aging the top priority.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>His classic book was a favorite of mine when I was in my teens also! lol  
<BR>
Have you seen the Japanese equivalent to this book?  Nowhere as exciting 
<BR>
graphically.  They use stick figures! But it is standard practice to give it 
<BR>
to newlyweds over there.  I'm sure they have much more 'appealling' sex 
<BR>
guides but that is the bestseller.
<BR>
<P>I was saddened to hear Charles Schultz died.  Some might say, &quot;just a 
<BR>
cartoonist&quot; but I loved _Peanuts_ very much.  Over the next thirty years or 
<BR>
so until longevity tech really improves we will be losing alot of people.
<BR>
<P>I do look forward to Saddam Hussein dying after having read an indepth 
<BR>
article on the horrors he has inflicted on his own people.  Seizing the 
<BR>
wives of other men and then sometimes killing both the husband and wife 
<BR>
later on is just one of his twisted personal habits.  But his sons will 
<BR>
probably carry on in similar fashion.  At least the older one who is a chip 
<BR>
off the old block.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
