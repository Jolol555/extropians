<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone ever hear of an invention by an Australian Physicist who invented a hand held &quot;rifle&quot; called Metal Storm?  This is/was an electo-static gun that pushed out (potentially)

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ja, there was a system devised that had a fire rate that high.  It had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a single barrel that packed a slug, a charge, a slug, a charge, alternating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its length.  As I recall it fired 32 projectiles in 20 milliseconds, something

<EM>&gt; girls.

Apropos of that sad incident (the six-year-old boy taking a gun to 
<BR>
elementary school and gunning down the six-year-old girl who was a
<BR>
classmateof his in the first grade), I saw an editorial cartoon of a weeping 
<BR>
man labeled the NRA, who was moaning, &quot;That poor  defenseless little girl!
<BR>
If only she had had a gun of her own...&quot;
