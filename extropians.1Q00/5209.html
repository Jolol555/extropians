I listened to the show.  What can I say?  I'm starting to believe that Bill 
<BR>
is just trying to make a name for himself in the eyes of the public is the 
<BR>
lone voice of reason in the issue.  I can certainly sympathize with his 
<BR>
concern about the potential pitfalls of GNR, but I think he's being a little 
<BR>
&quot;over the top&quot; in his characterizations of the risks.
<BR>
<P>In particular, I'm a little disappointed that Bill not once made mention of 
<BR>
the fact that the smart people, like those over at Foresight, have been 
<BR>
thinking long and hard about these issues and attempting to come up with 
<BR>
workable policies, for well over a decade now.  This seems a little bit 
<BR>
disingenuous of him, particularly since he is well aware of the work going 
<BR>
on at Foresight (and the fact that spoke at the very first Foresight 
<BR>
conference).
<BR>
<P>He also seems to refuse to recognize the fact that it is *impossible* for 
<BR>
anyone to stop GNR development, and the best that we can do is to attempt to 
<BR>
get all the various GNR efforts to coordinate their efforts and to share 
<BR>
their information to try to keep any particular camp from obtaining an 
<BR>
insurmountable lead.
<BR>
<P>Worst, he doesn't offer *any* solution.  He doesn't appear to be doing 
<BR>
anything but screaming his lungs out about a problem without a solution.  My 
<BR>
question is &quot;what's the point in that?&quot;  At first, I didn't see any problems 
<BR>
with Bill's attempt to introduce this into the arena of public discourse.  
<BR>
But now I fear that the only effect might be to cause trepidation in the US, 
<BR>
leaving Europe and Japan unfettered to take (or increase) the lead over the 
<BR>
US.  Who wants that?!?
<BR>
<P>The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to say &quot;Hey Bill, shut the 
<BR>
hell up!&quot;
