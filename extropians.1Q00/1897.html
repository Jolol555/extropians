I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman Sow. 
<BR>
Incredible movie. I think the idea of someone suddenly seeing that the world 
<BR>
was not as it appeared to be is quite relevant to us as 
<BR>
extropains/cryonicists/transhumans. When Truman came up against the wall at 
<BR>
the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death, 
<BR>
although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so 
<BR>
inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.
<BR>
<P>I recall that there was quite a bit of discussion about The Truman Show on 
<BR>
this list. Is there any way to search the Extro list archives and read those 
<BR>
messages? When I asked a couple of other people who saw the movie, they 
<BR>
thought it was a &quot;good movie,&quot; and that was about it. Are we weird, or what?
<BR>
