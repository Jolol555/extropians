<P>&lt;&lt; Unity does not mean uniformity.

&nbsp;Overall, I found the tone of your post rather trollish, especially
<BR>
&nbsp;given the message of cooperation Kathryn was conveying. Was it
<BR>
&nbsp;deliberate?

Happy new Year Extropian List! WOO HOO!!!
<BR>
I had to come back and share in the fun, since &quot;The future is Fun Again&quot; 
<BR>
: ) heheheh
<BR>
<P><P>I totally disagree Anders, I do not think the message she was conveying was 
<BR>
cooperative. I think it was condescending and troublesome and syrupy and 
<BR>
phony.
<BR>
Extropy is a subset? Listen, I heard of transhumanism from them, not the 
<BR>
other way around. 
<BR>
I have to be completely honest here. 
<BR>
I am really pissed to hear that crap: After all the nasty things she's
<BR>
accused my friends of, to imply in any way that they &quot;volunteer&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;support&quot;  another agenda, no way.
<BR>
I'm sick to death of this insisting that whoever she is, she is equal (or now 
<BR>
above) these really nice, kind, sweet people who are so committed to their 
<BR>
flight, and who have worked their asses off on some really amazing 
<BR>
publications, conferences, books, and newsworthy events. People who literally 
<BR>
open their door and are so gracious. 
<BR>
<P>I've heard enough.
<BR>
You may call me a Pink Haired Troll Doll, but I think it looks like a 
<BR>
transparent grab for publicity.
