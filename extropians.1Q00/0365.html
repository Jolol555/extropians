<P>Thanx, N-grrl. Add this to the fwds?
<BR>
<P>Thanx also to those who've responded so far, although there's been the
<BR>
predictable drift away from economic realities to the plausibility of
<BR>
competing tech paths to an assembler. Here's an extra bit I've written to
<BR>
amplify one ref in the previous post. (BTW, for those who've never seen THE
<BR>
SPIKE v. 1.0, there's already an ample account of the Drextech approach as
<BR>
sketched in everything from Engines through to Nanosystems. Trouble is,
<BR>
skeptical assessors of my book have been scathing abt Eric - for reasons
<BR>
that escape me - and demand [i] more real-world examples of progress and
<BR>
[ii] more detailed economic analysis of the path to assemblers.) 
<BR>
<P>The superscripts will drop out, alas:
<BR>
<P>============
<BR>
<P>Corporations such as Geron (in cancer, stem cell and telomere research) and
<BR>
Zyvex and Ntech (in micro- and nanotech realms) work on both immediate and
<BR>
long-term studies into topics that might yield truly flabbergasting
<BR>
outcomes eventually and in the meantime could bring more limited products
<BR>
to market
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Zyvex, a developmental engineering and directed research startup
<BR>
company founded in April 1997 in the Telecom Corridor of Richardson, Texas.
<BR>
&nbsp;Its explicitly declared goal is `to build one of the key pieces of
<BR>
molecular nanotechnology; the assembler.' They acknowledge an intellectual
<BR>
debt to Drexler in forming this goal (while recommending close attention to
<BR>
such refereed journals as Nanotechnology, Surface Science, Journal of
<BR>
Vacuum Science and Technology, and Journal of Physical Chemistry), and
<BR>
state that `our first product will be some type of assembler, which others
<BR>
can buy and set to work to make useful things for the market they are
<BR>
already familiar with. We don't expect to go conquer all known markets and
<BR>
make all possible products by ourselves. The assembler will be enough for
<BR>
starters.' The company was not seeking outside funds in early 2000, and
<BR>
announces `a 5-10 year time horizon for its first revenue'. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of assembler do they have in mind? Certainly not a handheld
<BR>
miracle machine, or an AI-controlled Genie. Rather, they envisage:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a system of unspecified size (possibly quite large initially--say one by
<BR>
two by two meters), capable of manufacturing materials or arbitrary
<BR>
structures with atomic precision, getting nearly every atom in the desired
<BR>
place. An error rate of 1 in 106 would allow meaningful structures to be
<BR>
built, and is probably a reasonable goal for the first generation. A more
<BR>
mature system would have error rates in the 1 in 1012 range or better.
<BR>
<P>A Zyvex assembler might be regarded as a child of a current Atomic Force
<BR>
Microscope (or Probe), powered and controlled from the outside, but ideally
<BR>
able to copy itself and even produce an improved version (again, naturally,
<BR>
following instructions provided by engineers). To handle useful amounts of
<BR>
raw materials and produce saleable quantities of goods, huge numbers of
<BR>
assembler manipulators will be governed by a central control processor.
<BR>
Zyvex expect to build assemblers with a million positional devices, each
<BR>
doing 1000 tiny tasks a second. That's a billion molecular building blocks
<BR>
put into exact place every second, for each chunky assembler--still not a
<BR>
great deal in visible terms. The second generation might graduate up to
<BR>
1015 building units a second (that's a million billion), and the third
<BR>
generation commercial assembler would process 1024 molecular Legos a second.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their game-plan for reaching even the earliest of these mints is
<BR>
cautious. They'll start with current microelectromechanical machinery (MEM)
<BR>
technology. A MEM assembler, has the advantage, as a testbed, that what
<BR>
it's compiling will actually be visible under a scanning or even an optical
<BR>
microscope. Next might follow a fullerene or nanotube assembler, handling
<BR>
and chemically bonding pre-grown microscopic carbon tubes. Trust me, it
<BR>
will not be building a diamond spaceship out of old potato peelings,
<BR>
however. This humble forerunner of the mature mint will put together very
<BR>
strong structural beams, welding carbon tubes into rods or pipes stronger
<BR>
and lighter than steel. Zyvex have in mind a device that is far from
<BR>
perfect but can function without the hard vacuum or difficult temperatures
<BR>
needed in more classy designs. So it won't build diamond or diamondoid, but
<BR>
will make useful products, and compile them cheaply. `All we need,' Zyvex's
<BR>
promotional website confesses, `is a suitable reaction, a suitable
<BR>
catalyst, a suitable positioning device, and some luck getting the catalyst
<BR>
stuck onto the end of the positioning device just right. Does that sound
<BR>
hard?' They are honest, and wry. `Yes.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, by 1999, the company had already announced the launch of Zybot
<BR>
Mark 1, a MEM micromanipulator with two little grabbers able to move with
<BR>
five degrees of freedom, `holding MEMS Precision Instruments tweezers'. The
<BR>
Zybot will make more elaborate MEM gadgets, and so on--all the way down,
<BR>
perhaps. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can start to see how the program comes together.
