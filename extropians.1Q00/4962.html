<P><EM>&gt; The point of this digression is that the military think-tank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; establishment is already developing a mind-set that could evolve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into one adaptable to &quot;nano-war&quot;: The factors described above in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection with anticipation of a strategic and tactical environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characterized by a tiered deployment of increasingly autonomous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller and smaller munitions seems capable of evolving into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimate development of &quot;robo-warfare&quot; at the molecular scale.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is my impression too from my encounters with the
<BR>
military-industrial complex. It might take a long while to percolate
<BR>
through the various military organisations, but political pressures
<BR>
towards lower budgets and higher efficiency against new, ill-defined
<BR>
threats might support it.
<BR>
<P>The problem with military nanotechnology isn't that it is military but
<BR>
that nanotech defenses might be withheld or suppressed in order to
<BR>
promote national security. That military forces are going to apply
<BR>
nanotech is a virtual certainty. The technologically leading nations
<BR>
are (not by coincidence) democratic nations with a strong interest in
<BR>
protecting themselves first and second the ability to exert
<BR>
force. Hence a lot of work is going to be done on nanodefenses, but
<BR>
allowing them to spread into the hands of the public or to other
<BR>
nations might be counterproductive - it would make potential enemies
<BR>
less vulnerable to their own weapons, and possibly give them the
<BR>
chance to work on cracking the defenses. This creates a situation
<BR>
where the military possess defenses intended to be deployed in case of
<BR>
an attack, but the public may be less well protected especially
<BR>
against low-level attacks.
<BR>
<P>A hopeful possibility is to treat nanowarfare from the start as
<BR>
something akin to bioweapons (there are many similarities). Growing
<BR>
tanks from local mud might be OK, but pouring gray goo on the enemy
<BR>
would be regarded as an atrocity. This could shift the emphasis
<BR>
towards nanodefense rather than nanoffence (there will definitely be a
<BR>
need for nanodefense anyway, since there will always be outlaw groups
<BR>
and accidents) and keep much of the defense development in the open.
<BR>
<P>This is actually something we can start working on right now, by
<BR>
suggesting good policies on how to deal with nanowarfare and starting
<BR>
a debate on making direct nanoweapons as politically unusable as
<BR>
bioweapons. If we start it rather than the luddites, then we can maybe
<BR>
keep it from becoming &quot;ban all nanotech because it will kill us all&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;nanotech them all and let God v2.0 sort them out&quot;.
