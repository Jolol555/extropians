<P>LEONARDO SUED !
<BR>
- --------------------------------
<BR>
<P>ENGLISH PRESS RELEASE
<BR>
<P>PRESS RELEASE	FEBRUARY 2000
<BR>
<P><P>LEONARDO
<BR>
French Association Founded in 1967 and On the Web Since 1994
<BR>
Under Legal Attack for Using the Name &quot; Leonardo &quot;
<BR>
<P>Court Suit Threatens the Existence of a Non-Profit Organization
<BR>
Dedicated to Bringing Together Art and the New Technologies
<BR>
For the Past 30 Years
<BR>
<P><P>THE FACTS
<BR>
<P>On November 3, 1999 a bailiff and eight policemen carried out a
<BR>
search directed against the Leonardo Association, raiding a private
<BR>
residence.  This highly unusual procedure was followed by the filing
<BR>
of a lawsuit against Leonardo by the Transasia Corporation and two
<BR>
co-complainants.
<BR>
<P>Transasia has just recently registered the names Leonardo, Leonardo
<BR>
Finance, Leonardo Partners, Leonardo Invest and Leonardo Experts in
<BR>
France.  It is suing Leonardo  for a million dollars in damages and
<BR>
interest on the grounds of trademark infringement.
<BR>
<P>Their basic argument is that a search engine request using the keyword
<BR>
&quot;Leonardo&quot; brings up not only the Transasia's sites but also the Web
<BR>
sites affiliated with the Leonardo arts organization.
<BR>
<P>As part of this suit, Transasia has asked that Leonardo be forbidden
<BR>
to use the word &quot;Leonardo,&quot; not only on its Web sites, but in any of
<BR>
its products and services, including its publications.  This strikes
<BR>
at Leonardo's right to exist.
<BR>
<P>LEONARDO: for 30 years the world's premier champion of a closer
<BR>
relationship between the arts and the sciences, providing information,
<BR>
promoting exchanges and stimulating thinking on both sides.
<BR>
<P>The Leonardo Association is a French non-profit organization.
<BR>
Together with the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and
<BR>
Technology (ISAST), it works to forge an international community of
<BR>
artists, scientists and students.
<BR>
<P>John Cage, Franck Popper, R. Buckminster Fuller have participated in
<BR>
Leonardo, an artistic and academic network founded in Paris during
<BR>
the 1960s by Frank Malina, a space science pioneer and kinetic artist.
<BR>
For 30 years now Leonardo has been dedicated to promoting artists
<BR>
who use science and the new technologies in their work.  Its activity,
<BR>
long centered on print media, now also includes a Web site and online
<BR>
publishing.
<BR>
<P>The broad juridical implications of the Transasia suit are of a matter
<BR>
of serious concern for all those involved in the Net.  The Leonardo
<BR>
Association, conscious of what is at stake in this case, is preparing
<BR>
a legal defense based on three main arguments:
<BR>
<P>Net Democracy: Forbidding someone to use a particular keyword means
<BR>
facilitating access to some sites and obstructing access to others.
<BR>
This is inequitable and contrary to the spirit of democracy that
<BR>
characterizes the Net.
<BR>
<P>The principle of antecedence (&quot;first come, first served&quot;): Leonardo
<BR>
magazine has been published and circulated internationally for
<BR>
three decades.  It has been available online as an MIT electronic
<BR>
publication since 1994 (mitpress.mit.edu/Leonardo).
<BR>
<P>Thus suit betrays a bias in its choice of target: Search engines
<BR>
looking for the keyword &quot;Leonardo&quot; come up with many Web pages,
<BR>
some of them dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci and others to Leonardo
<BR>
DiCaprio!

<P><P>(c) OLATS (Observatoire Leonardo des Arts et des Techno-Sciences)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.olats.org
<BR>
<P>The Leonardo Observatory for the Arts, Sciences and Technology (OLATS)
<BR>
is a research group whose work is presented on a mainly French-
<BR>
language Web site.  OLATS offers information, guidance and potential
<BR>
links between the arts and science and technology.  It encourages
<BR>
the production of technologically-based artworks and helps bring
<BR>
scientists and artists together.  This site is affiliated with the
<BR>
Leonardo Association, which for 30 years now has played a major role
<BR>
in providing information, promoting exchanges and stimulating thinking
<BR>
on both sides.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The VIRTUAL AFRICA Project
</EM><BR>
Virtual Africa is a multimedia project whose mission is to build
<BR>
bridges between artists and intellectuals in Africa and the rest of
<BR>
the world.
<BR>
<P>In January 2000, OLATS/Virtual Africa sponsored The River Festival,
<BR>
in which a group of international artists, most of them working in
<BR>
new media, gathered to travel down the Mouhoun River in Burkina Faso
<BR>
and meet with their counterparts in that country.  Together they
<BR>
have produced artwork in the villages and hold workshops with local
<BR>
artists, school children and street kids.  In November-December 2000
<BR>
and May-June 2001, all of these artists will tour Europe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The PIONEERS &amp; PRECURSORS Project
</EM><BR>
Technological art has a past, but does it have a memory ?  Through
<BR>
rigorous online documentation, the PIONEERS &amp; PATHBREAKERS Project
<BR>
aims to resituate the importance of artists such as Nicolas
<BR>
Schoffer, Nam June Paik, Rauschenberg, Stockhausen, Takis, Tinguely,
<BR>
whose thoughts and work were so influential for the evolution of
<BR>
technological art.
<BR>
<P>LEONARDO'S PUBLICATIONS
<BR>
Leonardo's magazines and books are produced by Leonardo/IAST in
<BR>
San Francisco and published by the highly-respected MIT Press in
<BR>
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Leonardo's magazine: Journal of the International Society for the
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arts, Sciences and Technology
<BR>
This English-language bimonthly magazine is the publication of
<BR>
reference in the domain of art and the new media.  It is available in
<BR>
all major libraries and, since 1994, has got a web site from MIT Press
<BR>
(mitpress.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo).  The journal embraces all the
<BR>
artistic disciplines -- new media, music, performance art, conceptual
<BR>
art, land art, artificial intelligence, etc.  By emphasizing the
<BR>
writings of artists themselves, it helps make sure that their voices
<BR>
are heard and that they are full participants in the process of
<BR>
developing of new technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Leonardo Music Journal (LMJ)
</EM><BR>
Accompanied by an audio CD, LMJ is a forum open to composers, artists,
<BR>
researchers, musicians, musical instrument makers and musicologists
<BR>
- -- all those whose work involves coloring outside the lines and
<BR>
redefining the borders between musical and artistic disciplines.
<BR>
Its purpose is to bring whole new perspectives into view.
