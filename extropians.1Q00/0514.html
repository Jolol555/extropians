<EM>&gt;I realize random quotations of humor are generally off-topic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I can't resist mentioning a wonderful .sig I saw recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(I think on Slashdot):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Whenever I face a tough situation in life, I think 'What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would Jesus do?' and the thought of my enemies roasting in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hellfire for all eternity makes me feel better.&quot;

<P>&quot;Whenever I face a tough situation in life, I think 'what would Christ do?' and
<BR>
then I remember that he got nailed to a cross. Oh, well. Maybe I should think
<BR>
'what would Socrates do?' but then, he got poisoned, didn't he. Oh, well.
<BR>
Perhaps I should think 'what would Galileo do?' but wait -- he got sentenced to
<BR>
house arrest for the remainder of his life. Oh well. Maybe I should think 'what
<BR>
would Buddha do?' and then I remember that his ideas got banished from India. Oh
<BR>
well. I guess I'll just think 'what would an intelligent, mature, rational
<BR>
person do?' And then the tough situation seems to take the form of what to do
<BR>
about people who make tough situations tougher by their blind allegiance to
<BR>
charismatic leaders.&quot;
