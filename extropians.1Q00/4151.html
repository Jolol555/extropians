<EM>&gt; I'll check out the link, thanks. I probably do have a too-kind view of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fabians for two reasons--I never really studied them much, unlike the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marxists, and they never directly achieved power unlike the Marxists. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latter was partly due the British culture but also because they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gradualists rather than revolutionaries. In the long run, though, they did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have an enduring socialist effects on British politics through the Labour
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Party. That only started to crack around 1979 when Margaret Thatcher
</EM><BR>
became
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Prime Minister. (The Iron Lady.) If the Fabians had been in control,
</EM><BR>
things
<BR>
<EM>&gt; might have been just as ugly as we saw with the various manifestations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applied Marxism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Max, I would agree and disagree in that since the Fabians were all that you
<BR>
have
<BR>
said they were and for those reasons total domination of the English
<BR>
political scene by them would not been as extreme. For all of the talk of
<BR>
internationalism
<BR>
Maxism is analogous to the Eastern Orthodox church, its character and
<BR>
temperment
<BR>
expressed itself through its national character.
<BR>
<P>However, I think what is lacking in some of the other posts is insufficent
<BR>
historical
<BR>
perspective regarding the underlying drives toward socialization in the
<BR>
first part of the 20th
<BR>
century. Capitalism as a force, though powerful, was still crude and brutal.
<BR>
Bill Gates
<BR>
for all the allusions drawn between him and the robber barrons does not have
<BR>
guards
<BR>
at Microsoft armed with machine guns as did Henry Ford at his assembly
<BR>
plants.
<BR>
People were looking for a way out of their problems of the lack of control
<BR>
over their
<BR>
lives, unemployment, low wages, poor working conditions, and some justice.
<BR>
Socialism,
<BR>
communism, and fascism, technocracy, and other movement all had strong
<BR>
followings
<BR>
that at the time seemed very convincing reasons. Just like our renew love
<BR>
affair with
<BR>
captialism does to us now.  In hindsight, even if collectivization
<BR>
contributed as much
<BR>
misery to the world as did capitalism at least in the case of the New Deal
<BR>
in the United
<BR>
States by unionizing the country it was saved from a more extreme swing
<BR>
(probably to
<BR>
&nbsp;the right) and in the processes infused it with more of a sense of ethics
<BR>
and responsibility.
<BR>
<P>This could go on for some time. I don't want &quot;Roberts&quot; to get a reputation
<BR>
of being too
<BR>
wordy, but suffice it to say given the material and information base and
<BR>
collective
<BR>
experience people were doing what they thought was the right thing. We and
<BR>
they
<BR>
(if they lived) came to realized they made gross mistakes. Yet, just look at
<BR>
your own
<BR>
life experience and blow it up to a global scale and you can see how it can
<BR>
happen.
<BR>
It is only because of this experience we have what we have and can say what
<BR>
we say.
