<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; Remember, one of the first acts of the Klinton administration was to 
</EM><BR>
cancel
<BR>
<EM>     &gt; Argonne Labs' Integral Fast Reactor project, just before the technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt; demonstrator unit was to go on line.
</EM><BR>
<P>A good move, otherwise it would have been an even bigger white elephant than
<BR>
the space shuttle. It just makes no economic sense. The thing's claim to 
<BR>
fame is its
<BR>
ability to turn common U238 into Plutonium in a very big way, but there's 
<BR>
already a
<BR>
glut of Plutonium in the world. Unfortunately.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; This design was touted as being inherently safe,
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that's true. A breeder has a much higher energy density than 
<BR>
a regular
<BR>
reactor and that means it's inherently more dangerous. A conventional 
<BR>
reactor uses
<BR>
Uranium as fuel in which the U235 has been enriched from the naturally 
<BR>
occurring
<BR>
.7% concentration to about 4%,  you need about 85% to make a bomb.  A breeder
<BR>
uses weapons grade plutonium  as a fuel, and lots of it. Also, a 
<BR>
conventional reactor
<BR>
uses water as a coolant and to slow down the neutrons, a breeder uses 
<BR>
molten sodium
<BR>
that burns in the air and explodes in the presents of water. After a short 
<BR>
time in operation
<BR>
this hot liquid sodium becomes intensely radioactive.  And that's not just 
<BR>
a theoretical danger,
<BR>
in 1996 a leak in a sodium pump destroyed the newest and largest breeder 
<BR>
reactor in Japan,
<BR>
if it wasn't in a containment building it could have been a human disaster. 
<BR>
It's already an
<BR>
economic disaster of several hundred million dollars.
<BR>
<P>All reactors produce plutonium, a big power plant reactor will invariable 
<BR>
produce many tons
<BR>
of it in its lifetime. A breeder reactor is designed to maximize the 
<BR>
production of plutonium but
<BR>
I don't think that's a real good idea. There is already so much of it in 
<BR>
existence, thousands of
<BR>
tons, that it's very hard to keep track of it all. You only need slightly 
<BR>
over 9 pounds to make
<BR>
a crude nuclear bomb, less if you're clever.
<BR>
<P>What I like is fusion power, in particular the reaction between non 
<BR>
radioactive deuterium
<BR>
(Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this produces non radioactive 
<BR>
Helium 4,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important of 
<BR>
all, no neutron
<BR>
to make other things radioactive. Unfortunately there's not much Helium 3 
<BR>
on Earth and
<BR>
you need a higher temperature and pressure to achieve the reaction than the 
<BR>
deuterium
<BR>
tritium reaction most are talking about.
