<EM>&gt;I can in addressing your subtle question.
</EM><BR>
<P>My question has subtle implications, but as MMB notes, it was an axe-blow.
<BR>
<P>Here are some perhaps salient observations from my book THE ARCHITECTURE OF
<BR>
BABEL:
<BR>
<P>-------------
<BR>
<P>Humans, in short, evolved as extended phenotypes:  each body is as
<BR>
incomplete outside its cultural setting as a spleen set loose in the
<BR>
jungle.  Being an ambulant organ in a disseminated system is no easy life:
<BR>
there are many ways to go awry.  While much contemporary literary theory
<BR>
takes it as established that Freudian hermeneutics is the discipline of
<BR>
choice for unpicking such problems,  this is by no means widely accepted
<BR>
within other traditions which deal with overlapping problematics - least of
<BR>
all psychology.  Consider the careful summary estimate from B. A. Farrell's
<BR>
The Standing of Psychoanalysis, which I must cite as length to capture the
<BR>
full spectrum and force of its judgement:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central generalisations from the theory of instincts - about death and
<BR>
aggression and self-preservation - are mistaken, because the whole concept
<BR>
of instinct embodied in them is a mistake.  There is evidence to believe
<BR>
that the infant goes through certain early stages of bodily interests and
<BR>
satisfactions.  But it runs counter to the state of play in science to
<BR>
suppose that the infant is sexually driven in going through these stages.
<BR>
The generalisation about the `Oedipus' and `castration' complexes in boys
<BR>
is conceptually confused, and, when clarified, of very doubtful adequacy.
<BR>
The parallel generalisations for girls are either unsupported or
<BR>
disconfirmed.  But when the doubtful aspects of the `Oedipal' story are
<BR>
cleared away, we seem to be left with what may be important pointers to the
<BR>
development of the infant in respect of its own body and its early adult
<BR>
figures.  The generalisations about latency and bisexuality are
<BR>
disconfirmed [while that] about `normal' human sexuality has no scientific
<BR>
backing at present [nor that for] an anal-sadistic stage.  [Evidence
<BR>
suggests] that the human being may function in the ways outlined by the
<BR>
mechanisms of repression and displacement [but] that the theory of dreams
<BR>
and symbolism will not do, and only contains a part of the truth.  There is
<BR>
some evidence to support the concept of the oral character, stronger
<BR>
evidence to support the concept of an anal one; but insufficient evidence
<BR>
to support the analytic story of their origins.  Nor is there any evidence
<BR>
to support the analytic account of neurotic disorder or the perversions.
<BR>
There is some weak support for the analytic account of homosexuality, but
<BR>
the experimental work about paranoid schizophrenia is of dubious value. ...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If [this] account of analytic theory and practice ... is anywhere near
<BR>
the truth, then one thing is clear.  The impact of psychoanalysis on the
<BR>
West cannot be justified on the ground that it contains a body of
<BR>
reasonably secure or established knowledge about human nature.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farrell's case is not limited to the notorious difficulty in finding
<BR>
substantive evidence for the effectiveness of psychoanalytic therapy, which
<BR>
he gives only one chapter (though his tape-transcribed case studies from
<BR>
the consulting room of the psychiatrist Turquet are certainly corrosive:
<BR>
`the material is perspective-dependent; and it is self-confirmatory and
<BR>
therefore method-dependent to some degree, and hence artefact-infected').
<BR>
His main thrust, like poststructuralism's, is hermeneutic: his fourth
<BR>
chapter is `the argument from intelligibility', his fifth deals with
<BR>
`psychoanalytic interpretation'.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative estimate, heavily influenced by Lacanian versions of
<BR>
Freud, posits that discourse is in a deep sense unintelligible unless we
<BR>
accept that language has an unconscious, and that psychoanalytic methods
<BR>
are the most valuable known for `interrogating' that unconscious
<BR>
speech/writing.  As individuals we are interpellated and produced by the
<BR>
text, and the text of the world, as we produce it (but there is no `we',
<BR>
only subject-positions).   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can `language', an abstraction as remote from ontological
<BR>
instantiation as `the unconscious', `have' anything of the sort?  Thought
<BR>
and speech and writing, in whatever order we chose to list them or place
<BR>
them in hierarchy, no doubt function at varying levels of accessibility: it
<BR>
is misleading to reify this truth.  Consider a typical poststructural
<BR>
formulation, the most famous gnome of Lacan's: the unconscious is
<BR>
structured like a language.  Two objections are evident.  Firstly, the
<BR>
entire structuralist project from which Lacan's work springboards was
<BR>
founded in the grand analogy of all the human sciences with linguistics, in
<BR>
its Saussurean recension.  If by hypothesis everything human is structured
<BR>
like a language it is hardly informative to be told that the unconscious,
<BR>
too, is among their number.  More precisely, though, it is likely that the
<BR>
hypothesis is based on a dubious figure.  The surmise that the unconscious,
<BR>
conceived as the source of language, is structured like its manifest output
<BR>
draws upon such images of isomorphism as stamp and wax or (at the level of
<BR>
DNA coding) egg and chicken.  But there are many quite important ways in
<BR>
which, for example, an ice-cream machine is not like an ice-cream.  That
<BR>
this analogical step is so readily taken in the absence of compelling
<BR>
evidence in its favour bespeaks the imposition of authority and power, even
<BR>
if these are embodied in hegemonically oppositional figures and texts.
<BR>
`Say it's Oedipus,' in Deleuze and Guattari's parodic demystification, `or
<BR>
you'll get a slap in the face.'   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major difficulty for anyone from the `scientific' side of Snow's `two
<BR>
cultures' dichotomy is the disdain which poststructural psychoanalysis
<BR>
appears to evince for empirical (and in some cases, as we have seen,
<BR>
logical) considerations.  Consider that notable - and quite central -
<BR>
theoretical construct of Lacanian thought, the `mirror stage' of infantile
<BR>
development.  Raymond Tallis, in the passage below, points up what is
<BR>
surely a fairly obvious pragmatic self-refutation (unless the `stage' is
<BR>
meant to be taken so loosely as to be no more than a metaphoric heuristic,
<BR>
and a misleading one); that this kind of debunking analysis has evidently
<BR>
had no effect whatsoever on Lacanians I see as paradigmatic of the failure
<BR>
of debate between important current theoretical positions:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lemaire expresses it `The Mirror Stage is the advent of coenaesthetic
<BR>
subjectivity preceded by the feeling that one's own body is in pieces.  The
<BR>
reflection of the body, then, is salutary in that it is unitary and
<BR>
localised in time and space.'  Is the reflection of the body that infants
<BR>
receive in the mirror thus unified?  Is not the image very often only
<BR>
fragmentary, consisting of part of the body - usually face plus or minus
<BR>
the neck and shoulders?  How often does the child see the whole of its body
<BR>
in the mirror?...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were
<BR>
dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the theory would
<BR>
predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be
<BR>
unable to enter language, society or the world at large.  There is no
<BR>
evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is
<BR>
borne out in practice.
