<P><EM>&gt;This is not as much as a &quot;Duh!&quot; as you think.  It is was currently believed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that DNA defines an animal's appearance and much of its personality.  These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clones had identical DNA and different egg cells.  The egg cells were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought to be empty containers to hold the DNA.  Now that the animals look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and act different, it appears that DNA is not the end-all blueprint that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought it was.  Apparently, much of the animals definition comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-DNA sources.

<P>This is no surprise: identical twins can be different,  Not only is 
<BR>
environment important, some genes have stochastic effects similar to
<BR>
symmetry-breaking.  The mother, incidentally, is a substantial part of
<BR>
the environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This throws much of our assumptions about genetics out the window.

<P>Only if the differences are heritable.  Also, you may be getting changes
<BR>
from telomere shortening, transposon relocation, etc.  Those would not
<BR>
force us to throw out assumptions, just indicate that certain intracellular
<BR>
genomics we current think are unimportant make a big difference.
