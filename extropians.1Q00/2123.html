<EM>&gt; I have yet to get a copy of _Nanomedicine_ -- mostly because of the price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue.  (And it's probably beyond my understanding right now.:)

No, start with the first 3 chapters which are quite easy to read.
<BR>
Then browse the remaining chapters as your interest and energy permit.
<BR>
Understanding it *all* is beyond any but the most dedicated engineers.
<BR>
Where it excels is in providing you with the background information,
<BR>
the relevant physics &amp; math (to grind the pundits noses in) and some general
<BR>
conclusions (so you can think about what this means creatively).
<BR>
<P>Unless I need the math (which I have on a few occasions), I just skim
<BR>
it and focus on the background information and the conclusions.  Thats
<BR>
the same way I've dealt with Nanosystems (my several copies of which
<BR>
now have numerous stickies dangling out of them).
<BR>
<P>Buy a copy, leave it sitting on your coffee table the next time
<BR>
you have your family to dinner or have a party.  Take it with
<BR>
you when you go sit in coffee shops, read a little bit, then
<BR>
close the book and stare off into space dreamily (that gives
<BR>
people an opportunity to come over and talk to you about it).
<BR>
Take it home on holidays, leave it conspicuously in the empty
<BR>
seat next to you on the plane.  If you don't have a copy but
<BR>
your university does, spring for copies of one or two chapters
<BR>
and a color copy of the cover.  Sell, Sell, Sell.  Your life
<BR>
may depend on it.  If your university doesn't have a copy call
<BR>
up your city library and request they get a copy.  Enroll
<BR>
your librarian (tell him or her their life may depend on it).
<BR>
<P>If you want some discussion of &quot;real life&quot; applications, read
<BR>
the paper on respirocytes in the Nanomedicine subsection at the
<BR>
Foresight Institute.
