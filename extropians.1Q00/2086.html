He wets his finger and pays attention to where it gets coldest before he
<BR>
speaks:
<BR>
<P>Well, here's where I think &quot;the real&quot; is headed, just because it's a
<BR>
path of least resistance. I think that something that &quot;gets&quot; the carbon
<BR>
out of exhausts, and maybe the nitrogen oxides too, is going to be the
<BR>
next _big_ thing, generally because it's retrofittable, while old oil
<BR>
remains King Log. But I'm not sure how soon it'll be, how it'll be
<BR>
accomplished (I'm guessing bespoke thermophilic ((en)zymoids, catalysts
<BR>
being less vexing than organisms), nor what regimes it/they'll fail
<BR>
utterly at. If the booze-and-air fuel cells catch the wave and hit the
<BR>
shore on schedule...in about 2002 in time for Christmas,
<BR>
maybe...scavenging the carbon is all you need there. I don't know what
<BR>
those fuel cells do with the carbon. My guess would be they take the
<BR>
easy way out. :) I like the idea of a house fuel cell-heater-water
<BR>
heater-water source a lot, and methane is an obvious fuel there.

<EM>&gt; No offense taken or intended, I believe, I am just trying to focus on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real, rather then the ideal; which seemed to be where your critique was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situated. As for 'exotic' power sources, I am all for them-as long as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can actuually work and people want to buy the energy they produce; including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biofuel, fusion, solar, PowerSats, strange matter-whatever.  As you already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to know there is so much smoke and mirrors in anticipating future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trends; that a more tactile approach is salutory-hence my focus on natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gas and wind. These seem to be the only real brightspots, in an otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gloomy energy outcome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Methane-would not necessarilly be the fuel for your engine or fuel cell-but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely the source, i.e. fuels derived from methane.  Wind Power has been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decent success in europe and is making Pacific Gas and Electric some real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; valuta. Would that it were true for Drexlerian blacktop roads using nano to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illuminate civilization, or or Uncle Arthur's Zero-point energy, in a can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sigh!

<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't follow you. I was being silly about methane, and explaining some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  genuine drawbacks of wind. You announce they are the growing-est. Great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  for them--vote with your wallet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Then you lose me. Things cost what they cost. Costs change over time. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  don't want a methane powered car badly enough to build one. I like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  sailboats a lot, but they're very expensive, specialized vehicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Ground-floor apartment dwellers in tightly-packed suburbs don't get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  put up windmills, no matter how much they want to. That's real world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  stuff too. You don't have to visit Tomorrowland. You don't have to ride
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  in one of the Mad Hatter's teacups, either. I am selective about &quot;early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  adoption&quot;, or I try to be. YMMV. Groovy, it's a big planet.
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt;  I am not trying to offend you, but you seem to have taken offense.
