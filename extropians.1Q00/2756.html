<P>
If the government defaults on its debt, which is to some extent made up of T-bonds
<BR>
bought by the should-be Social Security escrow, then when that happens then there
<BR>
would be no more Social Security, and all of those citizens having given the
<BR>
government peacefully their FICA taxes in return for expectation of minimal
<BR>
retirement income would find themselves bereft.
<BR>
<P>There is no point in the government carrying any debt, except to those collecting
<BR>
interest on it.  Consider the statement that about 9 percent of gross federal
<BR>
income goes to pay interest on government debt.  That means out of every dollar
<BR>
each citizen gives to the government, about a dime goes to service its debt.  This
<BR>
is a terrible thing.
<BR>
<P>So, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors about the government's books.
<BR>
<P>Can anyone say where is to be found the IRS breakdown of its income, that is, who
<BR>
pays what to the government?  It would be nice to have in one place all of the
<BR>
charts, graphs, and tables.  As it is if it's available it's not very.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Now I turn the recent 2001 proposed budget of the U.S. Federal Government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The issue:  it is not who watches the watchmen but who pays them.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; United States is benefitting from unheralded state of productivity growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which rises, explicitly economically, from investment in research and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; development, and more vaguely Alan Greenspan, and very minorly, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; politician.  I am thinking that most people make more money than me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thus paying more taxes, yet I am still interested in where my 1/3 of total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; monetary productivity given to the government does go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Here's where it should go:  paydown of the national debt.  The younger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generation didn't make it and doesn't want it, and the baby boomers will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; living long enough that it would be bad for them if Social Security crashed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ross, many years ago I was a big anti-debt advocate (for the reasons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you outline).  I'm not so sure anymore.  I suspect that I could make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a pretty good case that properly directed government spending towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the development of an &quot;almost anything&quot; box will produce so much growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the near future, that the national debt is irrelevant.  Why do people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy bonds?  To have an income in the future.  Why do they need an income?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To meet their material requirements.  Now while Robin might disagree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we don't throw away the economy overnight, I could see a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting scenario where the government develops an almost anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box, puts it in the public domain and simultaneously defaults on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any remaining national debt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing I am pretty sure about is that in a few years, if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes clear that biotech is going to significantly extend longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (e.g. William Haseltine, CEO of Human Genome Sciences, predicting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Oct 18, 1999 WSJ Health and Medicine section, pg R10, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the life expactancy of people born in 2050 will be 150+ years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then Social Security will be permanently broken and the only way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out will be to invest in nanotech lifeboat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that growth is in a long term upswing, but planning on it is an invitation
<BR>
to inflation.
<BR>
<P>Properly directed government funding is that towards research and development, as
<BR>
far as I know the only indicator of increase in productivity, that is the rate of
<BR>
increase in productivity is linearly and positively linked to R&amp;D.
<BR>
<P>Well, people will grow older, and be older longer.  Social Security will have to
<BR>
be reformed, as is evidenced by rising retirement ages.  Health care costs would
<BR>
be a rising burden, that would have to be solved.  At least by that time
<BR>
contemporary drug patents would be expired so that the government could be
<BR>
mandated to purchase &quot;generic&quot; drugs in the majority of necessary cases.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps at some point in the near future, the current retirement age could be
<BR>
correlated to life expectancy, then as life expectancy grew then the retirement
<BR>
age would rise correspondingly.  We can expect that as life expectancy rises that
<BR>
productive span increases as well.
<BR>
<P>About drug speech, Medicare prescription drug purchase sure would be a hell of a
<BR>
boon to pharmaceuticals who would be happy to charge the government for drugs that
<BR>
the elderly might not need.  They should get the ones that they do need.
<BR>
<P>So, about the fact that the U.S. government, over the course of its operations,
<BR>
has accrued a debt in the trillions, this is a problem.
<BR>
<P>Besides the debt and social security issue is the critical one of where each
<BR>
citizen's taxes go below the incredibly broad level of a federal or state budget.
<BR>
Who is the government paying more than $300 billion for defense reasons, quite
<BR>
specifically?  This is a general statement about detecting and eliminating fraud
<BR>
of the government, and thus of the people.
<BR>
<P>It still seems apparent that the government should endeavor to eliminate debt it
<BR>
has incurred against the public monies.
<BR>
<P>Could you explain what you mean by &quot;almost anything box&quot; some more.  If it is
<BR>
meaning a nanotech or transmuter or combination, whoever makes one will become
<BR>
rich.
<BR>
<P>Ross
