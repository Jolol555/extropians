<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neither pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called the NRA and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paranoid maniacs,&quot; *that* would be pejorative.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your so-called statement of fact is a statement about the desired goal
<BR>
of an organization.  Since it is contrary to the publicly stated goals
<BR>
of that organization, and contrary to the personal goals of everyone I
<BR>
have ever met who belongs to that organization it is not only pejorative
<BR>
but clearly a delibrate lie to discredit an opponent you know little
<BR>
about rather than having to do the hard work of arguing actual facts.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
