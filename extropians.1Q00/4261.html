This brings to mind a publication you might find interesting: Zygon, Journal
<BR>
of Religion and Science. This quarterly journal was originally published by
<BR>
the University of Chicago Press. It may not be extropian, but it's also not
<BR>
fundamentalist or creationist. The writers are usually very knowledgeable
<BR>
and undogmatic, and reality-oriented. Many articles are by scientists and a
<BR>
few have even been by atheists. I've found a lot of interesting information
<BR>
there over the years. If extropian ideas were ever to find common ground
<BR>
with religion, this might be a place to attempt dialogue.

We need people who have theological training to develop a whole theological
<BR>
basis (in several religions) for extropic concepts, and get them promoted in
<BR>
both the religious and mainstream press. Once this is in place, the
<BR>
reactionaries cannot lay sole claim to the theological 'high ground', and
<BR>
they will be seen for what they truly are: oppressive luddites.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is an interesting thought.  It's good to understand where the other
<BR>
person's perspective on things so you can better communicate with at least
<BR>
the possibility of making a positive connection.
<BR>
<P>By having knowledgeable and compassionate individuals trained for what you
<BR>
desire, it would be possible to gain positive impressions from their
<BR>
memberships.  This way, especially in a roundtable discussion, you will
<BR>
develop goodwill rather then animosity.
<BR>
<P>But you may be going to far in saying that the theological &quot;highground&quot; will
<BR>
be at least partially taken to the point where religious leaders will be
<BR>
seen as oppressive luddites!  If they are really against a certain thing
<BR>
they will demand membership to &quot;close ranks&quot; and rally round interpretations
<BR>
of core doctrines.  They are the religious leader in touch with God
<BR>
according to their group and not you, and so they can do this.
<BR>
<P>I would rather not have this happen because of a &quot;us vrs. them&quot; mentality
<BR>
where people are labeled and then treated in a certain way.  This has
<BR>
already been discussed extensively on the list.  We may not be able to
<BR>
control their actions but we can control our reactions.  Being understanding
<BR>
and level-headed in public forums will take transhumanist views much
<BR>
farther.  I think Max and Natasha are good examples of trying to do this in
<BR>
the mass media.  And for now, they along with Robert Bradbury, Nick Bostrom
<BR>
and a few others, are the one's who are dealing head-on with these issues
<BR>
and doing the best they can.
<BR>
