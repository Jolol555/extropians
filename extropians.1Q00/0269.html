<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;From (Anders?)&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Not at all. I can imagine intelligent and well-educated non-stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; people opposing transhumanism too, based on their values and knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of how the world functions. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In other words, these otherwise intelligent people have some blind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  spots of ignorance which cause them to act contrary to their own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enlightened self-interest (which is what transhumanism is all about).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is not what that person is saying, is it? It is your opinion, so not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreeing with you doesn't necessarily make them blind, just disagreeable to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How can you dictate what is 'enlightened self-interest' for someone else?
</EM><BR>
<P>A long, happy life is about as close as one can get to 
<BR>
the &quot;absolute good&quot;. Surely you would agree that trying 
<BR>
to live for as long as possible under the best possible 
<BR>
circumstances is the most sane and rational choice? Or 
<BR>
do you think that suffering, oppression and death are 
<BR>
*good*? Now, transhumanism happens to be more or less 
<BR>
the embodiment of the search for freedom, long life and 
<BR>
happiness, which means that those who oppose it support 
<BR>
death, suffering and oppression to some degree. That's 
<BR>
the whole idea behind the &quot;enemies of transhumanism&quot; 
<BR>
thing; that page is based on exactly the same assumptions 
<BR>
and arguments. And as it seems to enjoy widespread support 
<BR>
within the transhumanist community, then so should these 
<BR>
writings. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This sounds like what the spiritualists say about people who don't follow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their dogma.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but that doesn't mean that such a statement is 
<BR>
wrong by definition. It's good to be critical of dogmas, 
<BR>
but this shouldn't result in runaway relativism. If you 
<BR>
make some basic assumptions about what is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; 
<BR>
(see above), then you must conclude that some philosophies 
<BR>
are better than others. Transhumanism simply happens to be 
<BR>
the most rational product on the market. If something better 
<BR>
came along, I'd choose that. This is rather different from 
<BR>
more or less randomly picking a spiritualist (or political) 
<BR>
dogma and clinging on to it no matter what.
