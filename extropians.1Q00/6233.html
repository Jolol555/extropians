</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not looking to solve any random murders.  Where in the world did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that come from?  Let me try to explain it again.  I would be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use the system to obtain (1) specific data that is relevant to me and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my concerns or (2) random bits of the data stream that would have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relevance to me whatsever, other than some prurient thrill I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; derive from watching random strangers going about the boring days.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You fixated on that one tiny point and ignored the scope of the argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's my argument again, with &quot;the murder&quot; replaced with &quot;something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relevant to you and your concerns.&quot;  Try to read with charity in mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try to explain it *again*.  I would be able to use the system to 
<BR>
obtain (1) ****SPECIFIC**** data that is relevant to me and
<BR>
my concerns or (2) random bits of the data stream that would have no
<BR>
relevance to me.
<BR>
<P>This means I would have to *specify* what it was I was looking for.  Just as 
<BR>
you do when you go to google.com.  You can't go to google.com and say 
<BR>
&quot;Display whatever it is that is relevant to me.&quot;  I don't expect that you 
<BR>
will be able to do that with *any* system (at least not for a long time).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you even remember why I was arguing for this point?  I was arguing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would require a lot of computing power to show that those who had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computing power to use would find the system useful, whereas those who did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not have the computing power would not.  You're right, the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something's hard doesn't mean that one shouldn't do it.  But the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's hard/expensive means that it's easier for the powerful to do it than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is for the weak to do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've said before, the powerful may be needed to create it.  That does not 
<BR>
mean they will be the only beneficiaries.  You know, the internet, freeway 
<BR>
analogy, etc., etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You also keep going back to whoever &quot;controls&quot; the processing power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And I keep trying to steer you back to the web/database searching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; analogy.  Since it would deal with video and voice it might be harder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than searching for text.  But there *already* are video and photo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; search engines, crude though they may be.  I don't imagine that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will be prohibitively difficult to engineer.  A database is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; database, no matter what it contains.  Text, tags or other identifiers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could be appended to any type of data or file.  Have you ever searched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for a song using Napster?  Same thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can't search Napster for song lyrics, can you?  No, you can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;search for what people have ALREADY TYPED IN.  The difference is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;significant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Napster does not *contain* lyrics.  It is designed to allow for the 
<BR>
searching of mp3 files, and only mp3 files.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If it was in the gov't's interests to do so, it could outlaw computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which search the cameras, and use its own searching computers to search
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for people who break the law and arrest/shoot them on the spot.  So the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact that it requires a lot of computing power and the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gov't could easily take that power away from you shows that the powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have more use of it than the weak.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  And the government *could* outlaw all computers and all telephones 
<BR>
and fax machines and mail delivery and then it would be free to use those 
<BR>
things exclusively.  So in this sense the powerful also have more &quot;use&quot; of 
<BR>
all communications technology.  So what do you suggest, going back to pen 
<BR>
and paper and couriers?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Think of China and the Internet.  Sure the Chinese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government has bigger and stronger computers than anybody else in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; China.  Does that mean that the government will benefit more from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; huge database that is the Internet than the populace will? My bet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the Internet will help to bring down totalitarianism in China
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like it did in Russia.  I see no reason why this same dynamic should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not apply (and even more so) to a distributed, robust and redundant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; power proportional mutual transparency network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;China finds it economically useful to have everyone using the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;China would not find it economically useful to provide servers so people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could find out which Chinese officials were doing something relevant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(though, if we assume Brin is right, they could not prevent the cameras
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from being used on them in the first place).  Instead, the Chinese gov't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would hoard such processing power for themselves, and outlaw it for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people.  They'd use that power to ensure that the law was enforced.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revolution would be possible under these circumstances.  The fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone could see it happening would not matter at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are making a couple of wrong assumptions here.  First, you are assuming 
<BR>
that the people of China would have to rely on the Chinese government to 
<BR>
provide transparency &quot;servers.&quot;  I have previously suggested that, to the 
<BR>
extent any centralized servers are needed at all, that they be run like 
<BR>
Usenet.  Distributed, robust and redundant.
<BR>
<P>You are also assuming *again* that it would take a prohibitive amount of 
<BR>
personal processing power just to make use of the system.  The system could 
<BR>
be designed to require almost *no* personal processing power.  How much 
<BR>
processing power does it take to receive email or a telephone call?  Have 
<BR>
you heard of MicroStrategy?  They *already* offer this type of service.  So 
<BR>
you *cannot* tell me that it cannot be done.  If you really are a programmer 
<BR>
I am *amazed* that you cannot see the feasibility here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You don't think the Chinese government would like to control the web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; servers?  Problem is the network is distributed, robust, and redundant, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they *can't*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They *COULD* if they had access to the servers and total surveilance was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in place.  That's the whole *point*, you use the cameras and the servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to find out when and where something relevant to you is happening, like,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for example, somebody scanning cameras to find relevant information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  If they had access to *every* server on the internet, they could shut 
<BR>
it down.  And if wishes were fishes, beggars would eat.  The point is that 
<BR>
the internet (as you know) was designed to be impervious to attack.  It is 
<BR>
distributed, and redundant.  It is therefore robust.  As a result, the 
<BR>
Chinese cannot shut down the net.  So they are trying the next best thing, 
<BR>
censoring it.  They will soon find that they can't do that either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The only argument you've provided that suggests why secrecy is useful for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;totalitarians is because they have a &quot;secret&quot; police force.  I asked you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why &quot;secret&quot; police, as such, were useful.  You did not respond.  I ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again: why SECRET police?  Why not openly well-armed thugs?
</EM><BR>
<P>Simple: if all the thugs wore a billboard that read: &quot;I am a government 
<BR>
thug&quot; the opposition would know, &quot;OK lets not tell *him* about our plans to 
<BR>
topple the government.&quot;  The reason secrecy is necessary for a despot is to 
<BR>
keep the people in ignorance and fear so that they cannot organize against 
<BR>
him.  It is simple mathematics:  By definition a despot and his cronies are 
<BR>
outnumbered by the oppressed masses.  If the majority of the people 
<BR>
supported the despot, he would not be a despot, he would be a cult leader.  
<BR>
So if 70% of the people in the US decided that they wanted you to be their 
<BR>
king, the remaining 30% of us would either have to like it or lump it (or 
<BR>
move to Canada).
<BR>
<P>Brin goes over this pretty well in his book where he describes the secrecy 
<BR>
methods used by Saddam to stay in power.  This is not virgin territory we're 
<BR>
crossing here.  This is freshman poli sci.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;It won't.  Video data is much harder to process than text.  That's what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;will make it harder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Harder is not impossible.  Besides, you keep overlooking the fact that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;text
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; based tags and identifiers that can be appended and/or linked to *any* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of file.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They CAN be linked, but they require a thinker to do so, so in that case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you need a big server to do the linking.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, yeah I know, so the argument is since you need a big computer to make 
<BR>
sense out of the data before it goes into an easily accessible database, 
<BR>
only big brother can do it, so he'll never share his toys with you.
<BR>
<P>We live in a constitutional democracy.  Ergo, big brother does what *we* 
<BR>
tell him to do.  On such an important issue as this if the few members of 
<BR>
the government decided to ignore the wishes of the people on this question, 
<BR>
the government would quickly find itself out of a job.
<BR>
<P>Question.  What would happen if Congress and the President woke up one day 
<BR>
and said &quot;Enough with this pesky internet thing.&quot;  Let's pass a law, only 
<BR>
government employees can use it.  Then the ACLU challenges the law.  But the 
<BR>
Congress and the President tell the Supreme Court justices that federal 
<BR>
judges would be allowed to use the internet too, since they are in fact 
<BR>
government employees.  So the Supreme Court rules that this preposterous law 
<BR>
is constitutional.  Now, you know the American press.  You know American 
<BR>
libertarians.  You know American left-wing and right-wing extremists.  So I 
<BR>
put the question to you.  What happens next?
<BR>
