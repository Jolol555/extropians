<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neither pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; called the NRA and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; paranoid maniacs,&quot; *that* would be pejorative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your so-called statement of fact is a statement about the desired goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of an organization.  Since it is contrary to the publicly stated goals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that organization, and contrary to the personal goals of everyone I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have ever met who belongs to that organization it is not only pejorative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but clearly a delibrate lie to discredit an opponent you know little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about rather than having to do the hard work of arguing actual facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Howzabout THIS for not only pejorative, but irretrievably true?  The 
<BR>
cruel and cynical actions of the NRA, as distinguished from their 
<BR>
Madison Avenue bullshit spindoctor-manufactured Hollywood (Prez 
<BR>
Charleton Heston?  Yagottabekidding!) image, would lead one to 
<BR>
necessarily believe that the voting majority of their members are 
<BR>
soulless ghouls who have perpetual hard-ons for and wear their 
<BR>
emotionally overwrought and bleeding hearts on their sleeves for 
<BR>
lifeless and engineered-for-the-express-purpose-of-death-dealing 
<BR>
hunks of metal, but cannot muster a shred of sympathy for dead 
<BR>
little girls.  They DO sociopathically, and quite obviously, care 
<BR>
more for killing machines than they do for their fellow human 
<BR>
beings, although to call the rest of the race their &quot;fellows&quot; slurs the 
<BR>
rest of humanity by association with pond scum.  It might be 
<BR>
impolite to call sick, twisted, demented and bloodthirsty 
<BR>
(&quot;PLEASE, Lord, lemme meet a mugger today and legally kill 'im!) 
<BR>
psychopaths what they are, but the truth, by definition, can 
<BR>
NEVER be an insult!
