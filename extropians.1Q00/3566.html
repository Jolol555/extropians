<P><P><EM>&gt; There is no *redness* in the brain,
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!  This is the classic example of the mistake I believe most
<BR>
of us are making and why our old science, to date, is miserably
<BR>
failing.  Perception is a long cause and effect process.  At the
<BR>
causal end of this process is the &quot;referent&quot; or what we are looking
<BR>
at.  At the opposite end of this complex cause and effect process,
<BR>
beyond the retina, past the optic nerve..., somewhere in the primary
<BR>
visual cortex, is the final result of the perceptual process or our
<BR>
conscious knowledge of what we are looking at.  This is where real red
<BR>
is!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing like this outside of our brain or beyond our
<BR>
senses.  As proof of this, how would virtual reality worlds, full of
<BR>
red and all other colors, be possible?  Are you saying there is
<BR>
&quot;redness&quot; inside of the ram which contains the representation of the
<BR>
&quot;virtual reality&quot; world that causes the color perceptions we perceive
<BR>
there?  Cirtanly not.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something that occurs out beyond our senses, which I
<BR>
believe you are referring to.  Perhaps we can call this &quot;referent red&quot;
<BR>
since we use red sensations to abstractly represent it.  But the two
<BR>
are very different, exist at opposite ends of the cause and effect
<BR>
perceptual process, and in fact color blind people sometimes surely
<BR>
use different sensations or quale to represent the same &quot;referent&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With todays limited &quot;abstract&quot; science all we really know of
<BR>
such &quot;referents&quot;, or all things beyond our representational senses, is
<BR>
abstract or behavior knowledge.  We simply infere that there is
<BR>
something out there that can cause light of a certain wavelength to
<BR>
reflect in a certain way.  We know nothing of what such &quot;red
<BR>
referents&quot; are like other than such abstract behavior.  Obviously,
<BR>
when a surgeon does surgery on a primary visual cortex that is
<BR>
&quot;perceiving red&quot;, there is nothing there anything like a &quot;red
<BR>
referent&quot; that will behave in such a way as to result in a perceptual
<BR>
process ending up with a real red sensation in the surgeon's
<BR>
consciousness.  Perhaps this is what you really meant?

<P><P><P>John Clark &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Predictions%20by%20Kurzweil&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002251938.MAA25178@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</A>&gt; also responded:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can't even detect your qualia much less measure it.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously our current sensing process, which includes all of
<BR>
our scientific instruments which simply add more cause and effect
<BR>
abstract levels to enhance this abstract process of observing only
<BR>
behavior of these &quot;referents&quot;, alone, can't do this.  Every level of
<BR>
such a long perceptual process simply abstractly represents or models
<BR>
the original referent in some different physical form.  Each form is
<BR>
very physically different from the previous one, and the final result,
<BR>
our conscious knowledge, is, again, different from them all.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this in no way implies that we &quot;can't even detect
<BR>
your qualia much less measure it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brain takes the abstract information from various senses.
<BR>
This neural firing representation of this information is nothing like
<BR>
the original referents beyond our senses that initiated the perceptual
<BR>
process, it simply abstractly &quot;models&quot; it.  Our brain takes this
<BR>
abstract model of the information and produces our conscious knowledge
<BR>
of the original referent.  Our brain then combines all of these
<BR>
diverse sensations such as color, smell, sound, warmth, pain...  into
<BR>
one unified conscious world (&quot;spirit world&quot; inside our brain if you
<BR>
will) where we most definitily can compare and contrast them.
<BR>
Comparing and contrasting is, by definition, measuring.  We most
<BR>
certainly &quot;detect&quot; them.  We know of the existence of these things
<BR>
more than we know of the existents of their distant referents which we
<BR>
can really only infer that they exist.  (Note: refer to the &quot;brain in
<BR>
a vat argument&quot;, virtual reality...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know and will never know if red is complex or not but I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know it's indescribable.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what you are trying to say but when you really think
<BR>
about it, this is completely false.  You are saying we can't &quot;eff&quot;
<BR>
sensations.  We can't tell someone what salt tastes like.  Of course
<BR>
simple &quot;abstract&quot; communication alone (what science and all our sensing
<BR>
has been to date) can't &quot;eff&quot;.  But there is only one simple missing
<BR>
piece that will give us true &quot;effing&quot; ability.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that is required to sufficiently model color qualia is the
<BR>
amount of information traveling through or being modeled by the neural
<BR>
firing in the optic nerve, Just as the taste of salt can be modeled by
<BR>
the information traveling through the nerves in the tongue to the
<BR>
brain.  The only thing left for us to do is to enhance our brain, in
<BR>
the same way nature did when it merged the ability of our
<BR>
consciousness to feel both red and salty at the same tame, including
<BR>
our ability to compare and contrast them (i.e. measure them).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do this, we've simply got to realize that there is
<BR>
more to the referent &quot;behavior&quot; of the neurons we are observing.
<BR>
We've got to know more than simply how they behave, we've got to start
<BR>
looking for what is it really like for them to behave that way.  Why
<BR>
is it like that for that person when they behave that way...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of simply assuming that *redness* is simply the
<BR>
behavior of reflecting light, there might be something additional to
<BR>
such physical behavior of reflecting light.  It may be more than just
<BR>
behaving in a particular way, it may actually be phenomenally &quot;like&quot;
<BR>
something.  Although the behavior of light reflecting off of something
<BR>
may not, itself, have phenomenal qualities, something in our brain
<BR>
(I'm betting it is closely related to the chemical processes that goes
<BR>
on as the synapse fires or something) is fundamentally phenomenally
<BR>
&quot;like&quot; something.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to look for more than just abstract behavior, we've
<BR>
got to discover what and why it is like what it is like.  Once we
<BR>
figure this out, we well then, like nature has done, reproduce
<BR>
multiple of these sensations within one consciousness, so that we can
<BR>
experience, compare, contrast, share, or more or less do much more
<BR>
than measure them.  We will say, this one is the same as that one, but
<BR>
another one is completely different.  That new one is nothing like
<BR>
anything I have ever experienced....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the abstract information being modeled in one person's
<BR>
optical nerve and feeding this into someone elses consciousness in
<BR>
such a way that it produces the same phenomenal &quot;quale&quot; is &quot;effing&quot;
<BR>
and just because we can't do it yet, doesn't mean science can't do it.
<BR>
And once we can do this, what's to stop us from actually sharing the
<BR>
conscious spirit worlds constructed of phenomenal qualia in merged
<BR>
brains so that we don't have to eff, we just both experience the same
<BR>
things?  Won't it be great when we can finally &quot;feel&quot; the whole
<BR>
experience of having sex, not just half of it?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the hypothesis has no room for experiencing all of

such experiences, not just half, if there is no room for effing and

all this... they are obviously grossly lacking.
