<P>
What the question is is if the government should have any say about what anybody
<BR>
says, the answer to which is no.
<BR>
<P>The obvious next question is if the government should have any say about what
<BR>
anybody does.  The answer is less obvious.  As the representative of the
<BR>
citizenry, the government can outlaw murder, for example.  It has done so,
<BR>
although the large majority of killings outside of the United States by U.S.
<BR>
citizens are part of government sanctioned actions.  War is hell, as it were,
<BR>
and not necessarily representative of the citzenry.
<BR>
<P>Given the fact that the Constitution with Bill of Rights exists and is the legal
<BR>
foundation for the entire government, can the government legislate drug, or for
<BR>
that matter, any other private expression?  Abso-frickin-lutely not, and any
<BR>
attempt to do so is nothing less than an attack on your and my rights.  To the
<BR>
extent that it has ever done so, it (the government) is out of line and should
<BR>
check itself as the standard penalties for the infringement of rights should
<BR>
apply to government officials as they do to anyone else.
<BR>
<P>Now I turn the recent 2001 proposed budget of the U.S. Federal Government.  The
<BR>
issue:  it is not who watches the watchmen but who pays them.  The United States
<BR>
is benefitting from unheralded state of productivity growth which rises,
<BR>
explicitly economically, from investment in research and development, and more
<BR>
vaguely Alan Greenspan, and very minorly, any politician.  I am thinking that
<BR>
most people make more money than me, thus paying more taxes, yet I am still
<BR>
interested in where my 1/3 of total monetary productivity given to the
<BR>
government does go.
<BR>
<P>Here's where it should go:  paydown of the national debt.  The younger
<BR>
generation didn't make it and doesn't want it, and the baby boomers will be
<BR>
living long enough that it would be bad for them if Social Security crashed.
<BR>
<P>So this document is a PDF file from the GPO web site.  Here's a good excerpt:

<BR>
74.7 80.4 78.6 82.6 84.4 86.4 5.8 3.8
<BR>
<P>So, Defense and Military Construction are budgeted 390,100,000,000.00 dollars.
<BR>
Forecasted government on-budget receipts from table S-11 (receipts) are 1519.1
<BR>
billion, so directly apportioned defense related spending amounts to at least
<BR>
%25.7 of forecasted receipts.  Besides itself, if it comes across anyone
<BR>
spending 1/4 of their income on weaponry related materials and not paying taxes,
<BR>
the government would not be happy about that.  Also, it might as well be
<BR>
honestly termed Attack.
<BR>
<P>There is speech about debt reduction.  One quote:  &quot;If [administration] had not
<BR>
changed the [previous administration's debt] policy, with the same trajectory of
<BR>
growth, in 2001, the publicly held debt would exceed $6 trillion, or 67 percent
<BR>
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), draining 17 cents from each Federal dollar
<BR>
to cover interest costs.  Instead, the publicly held debt is projected to be
<BR>
$3.3 trillion, or 33 percent of GDP, and declining.&quot;  So, currently, 9.35 cents
<BR>
of each dollar that is given to the federal government is going to pay
<BR>
interest.  The budget picture presented is a rosy one wherein the entire public
<BR>
debt is removed by their target date of 2013.  That would be great.  I wonder
<BR>
how exactly this happens.  Here's a leading quote:&quot;The [] plan to save Social
<BR>
Security would protect the entire Social Security surplus and dedicate it to
<BR>
debt reduction, and would extend the solvency of the program to mid-century.&quot;
<BR>
Questions on that particular statement:  q)  why not pay off all debt with any
<BR>
current Social Security &quot;surplus&quot; and then have the goverment pay back the debt
<BR>
to itself sans interest, ie, consolidate its debt to itself.  a)  Social
<BR>
Security &quot;surplus&quot; is already sold to T-bonds.  Uh-oh.  To whom is the
<BR>
government paying this interest on its debt, anyways?  If the Social Security
<BR>
&quot;surplus&quot; is dedicated to paying off the debt, which is a good idea, is it still
<BR>
a &quot;surplus&quot; or rather &quot;money paid and gone.&quot; Either way, it should be paid, very
<BR>
simply to avoid interest.  So, this plan is not clear here.  More about that
<BR>
later.
<BR>
<P>Well, the subject of this e-mail list thread was started in discussion of some
<BR>
things about drugs, and about how one provision would outlaw talking about
<BR>
drugs.  In relation to the budget, government proposed 2001 budget for federal
<BR>
law enforcement, &quot;criminal justice assistance&quot;, corrections, and
<BR>
&quot;litigation/judicial&quot; is about twenty-seven billion dollars, this not being
<BR>
state or local.  Sixty percent of those incarcerated federally are there for
<BR>
drug-related charges. Also, the budget proposes 19.2 billion dollars for &quot;drug
<BR>
control programs&quot;.  On a separate note related to the Medicare prescription drug
<BR>
proposal, the prescription drug companies would largely be happy about that.
<BR>
The budget also proposes giving $1.6 bil, a $1.3 bil increase, to Colombia.
<BR>
More about this proposal and drugs, it proposes $3.8 for rehab centers, $2 bil
<BR>
for propaganda, a $2 bil payoff to the communities for outreach education, and
<BR>
$9.8 BILLION dollars of drug money for law enforcement.
<BR>
<P>So, legalizing drugs and bringing the industry into this country instead would
<BR>
save all the monies spent on interdiction, not to mention the outrageous prices
<BR>
paid for drugs, could raise a large tax base, remove the government-enforced
<BR>
criminal culture from drug use, leave law enforcement to fight actual crime,
<BR>
keep inner city kids out of prison, and otherwise generally be better.
<BR>
<P>After the abolition of Alcohol Prohibition, did the use of alcohol, suddenly
<BR>
legal, rise?  Not particularly, no.
<BR>
<P>About the U.S. budget, I am not a financial expert but it appears that some
<BR>
numbers are missing.  More about that later.
<BR>

<P>Have a nice day,
