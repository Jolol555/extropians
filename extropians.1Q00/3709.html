<EM>&gt; Spike Jones wrote:   the life expectancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tables that most people take for granted and use plan their own lives are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on propaganda by the one industry that profits from our collective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pessimism: the insurance company!
</EM><BR>
<P>Heres an insight that Im in a priveleged position to know:  the
<BR>
Seventh Day Adventist church has a retirement fund for its
<BR>
employees which is in trouble.  You have a great test group here
<BR>
of people who have never smoked, light or no alcohol, mostly
<BR>
vegetarian, generally clean living people.  The fund is in big
<BR>
trouble because the retired church workers live and live and live.
<BR>
<P>By watching this fund and the number of years lived by those
<BR>
drawing, we should be able to collect some insights on the
<BR>
real life expectancy curve with respect to time, not that which
<BR>
the insurance industry would have us believe.  spike
