<P><EM>&gt; George, ya ever think that your Drexlerian (new meme!) Anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Boxes, as depicted in Neil Stephanson's novel Diamon Age, might be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long, long, ways off?  I am suggesting centuries to work out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technical bottlenecks. 
</EM><BR>
<P>A long time, yes, but *centuries*? Given the rate of change many of us
<BR>
seem to be assuming, that is far in the posthuman era. Of course, we
<BR>
could be wrong. But how hard is it to make a consumer usable
<BR>
near-anything box?
<BR>
<P>What seems to be needed is a massive parallel array of nanoassemblers
<BR>
that can be used to manufacture subcomponents and attach them to the
<BR>
growing structure. Drexler describes a 3D system, but even a plate of
<BR>
assemblers slowly moving upwards depositing the object would likely
<BR>
work. This seem to require a way of making a large number of
<BR>
assemblers, making them enough damage-resistant to work in a kitchen
<BR>
or able to repair/replace neighbouring assemblers when an error occurs
<BR>
and software able to specify how to build something useful. 
<BR>
<P>This seems to require a fairly mature nanotech, but nothing totally
<BR>
magical. Centuries doesn't seem a likely timescale unless
<BR>
nanoassemblers turn out to be really, really hard. Once you have a
<BR>
general assembler you can at least make a lot of general assemblers,
<BR>
and the problem instead becomes how to arrange and program them (lots
<BR>
of nontrivial micromechanics when you try to build a soft beef that
<BR>
will deform under gravity). Given the commercial potential of near
<BR>
anything boxes (everybody wants them, and then they will be running
<BR>
*your* propetary nanorecipe standard ;-) I guess development will be
<BR>
fast.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If ya buy into this premise, then what about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an older idea called Laser Deposition Spectroscopy? Thats where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lasers or particle beams basically sort matter by atomic weight and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deposit it separately.
</EM><BR>
<P>Doesn't this have real problem with complex organic molecules? Making
<BR>
washing machines might be possible, but a beef?
