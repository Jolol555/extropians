</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I dont know.  Let me take a running start at this.  A few days
<BR>
ago Robert Bradbury made an offhanded comment that gave me one hell
<BR>
of a brainstorm.  He said something to the effect of  &quot;...so much more
<BR>
would be accomplished if every engineer didnt need to keep reinventing
<BR>
everything...&quot;  OK, now there is one invention that is looking more and
<BR>
more like *the dividing line* in my own life: the web.  That one invention
<BR>
changed everything, more than the computer, more than the internet,
<BR>
(which I had been using since about 1980 for email), more than the
<BR>
microwave oven or anything.  It allows us to stop reinventing everything.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, we also have webcams now.  Anyone can not only set up
<BR>
a camera pointed at you, she can also fix it to broadcast on the web,
<BR>
so in a sense we are already living in a far more transparent world than
<BR>
ever before, and furthermore, the cameras continue to get smaller,
<BR>
cheaper and... ubiquitouser.  We already have faaaar less privacy now
<BR>
than any time since... the last century.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, if anyone is really interested, they can log on to
<BR>
one of the many intentional and voluntary webcams, such as the
<BR>
first of the oft-copied genre, Jennycam.  So Jeff, no one *cares*
<BR>
to look at you or me, when they can check out Jenny, or whoever
<BR>
is her male counterpart.  So yes, our privacy *can* be violated,
<BR>
however at the same time, no one *really wants to* because they
<BR>
have the choice of looking into some more interesting person's
<BR>
fishbowl life.  We are protected by the wealth of info, in a sense.
<BR>
<P>Is this a breakeven?  I dont know.
<BR>
<P>Consider that sports guy who was videotaped fooling around with
<BR>
a stewardess, what was his name?  Frank something?  Gilford?
<BR>
Why did that whole adventure get so many headlines?  Was it
<BR>
because he was nailed by a hidden camera in a hotel?
<BR>
<P>Consider this: cameras are now so small and so easy to hide,
<BR>
you can put one inside that ground hole in an electrical outlet,
<BR>
and they wouldnt even be seen.  They work, and you can even
<BR>
plug something into the socket, the camera will retract, then
<BR>
come back out when the plug is pulled out.  Those electrical
<BR>
socket cameras are cheap.
<BR>
<P>There was a local dentist who hid a camera in the womens
<BR>
restroom of his office.  He videotaped for months, only getting
<BR>
caught because his female employees noticed him scampering
<BR>
off to his office every time one of them went to the restroom!
<BR>
He must have noticed them looking for the camera, because he
<BR>
removed it, but the feds busted him the next day with the
<BR>
videotapes.  The ladies never did actually *find* that camera.
<BR>
The wretch practiced dentistry right here in this town.
<BR>
<P>How do we act differently now, knowing that we could be
<BR>
getting videotaped, any where, any time?  Eventually you
<BR>
know some yahoo is going to invent a mechanical robofly that
<BR>
can carry a camera and microphone into your home, thru the
<BR>
AC vent or something.  Would that affect the way we act?
<BR>
It is suddenly a privacy advantage to be a nerdy nobody.
<BR>
<P>But please, one last comment.  This attitude is coming from
<BR>
me, spike, the original info-nudist, the guy who is willing to
<BR>
let his every move be recorded, if there could be some
<BR>
scientific advantage to it.  What about the saner majority,
<BR>
who really *want* a bit of privacy, and now know that it
<BR>
can be taken from you against your will?  Would some of
<BR>
you comment on the robofly camera please?  spike
