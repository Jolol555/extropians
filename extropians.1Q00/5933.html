<EM>&gt; &gt; I thought &quot;eXistenZ&quot; was better than &quot;13th Floor,&quot; but both were more

<EM>&gt; &gt; believable than &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  The last, however, had the best effects
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; once I got past the stupid premise, it was okay, if a little
</EM><BR>
predictable.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd still like to know what would've happened if he took BOTH pills.:)

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; And considering that The Matrix won three oscars tonite, it seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have won the contest of whose memes got spread best.

<P>If that were the only way of judging things...  McDonald's beats a healthy
<BR>
diet in the short run too.:)
<BR>
<P>But seriously, the indicator for which ideas got out there is not the
<BR>
Academy Awards, but box office receipts.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; definitely won hands
<BR>
down there.  However, people I know who actually see all three, usually pick
<BR>
&quot;13th Floor&quot; -- finding &quot;The Matrix&quot; thin on acting and the premiss flawed
<BR>
and &quot;eXistenZ&quot; too much like a video game.
<BR>
<P>I guess, too, one has to think long term.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; will probably have a
<BR>
lasting effect.  I bet it will pop up in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; -- if it hasn't
<BR>
already -- and the special effects, hopefully, will be duplicated in other
<BR>
films.  However, one never knows.  The other two might get a following, just
<BR>
as &quot;The Arrival&quot; has its -- even though &quot;Independence Day&quot; beat it at the
<BR>
box office.
