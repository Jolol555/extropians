<EM>&gt;punishment in a future society....

<EM>&gt;Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;murder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and rape.  Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;sincerely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;John Grigg
</EM><BR>
<P>Talk about your ultimate false dichotomy...  Who CAREs what the inner 
<BR>
motivations, torments, etc. of the Bundy's of the world are?  Psychologists 
<BR>
and social workers and prison guards, for sure, as their income is derived 
<BR>
from such.  Otherwise, such information may be useful in a predictive sense, 
<BR>
as in assessing risk, personal or fiduciary, as in an insurance company 
<BR>
whose profits rest upon accurately beating the market in risk assessment.  
<BR>
It might certainly be useful personally in assessing a person's character, 
<BR>
but do we want to be in the business of trying to change character - 
<BR>
especially via punishment or reward?  This has demonstrably not worked very 
<BR>
often if at all.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Punishment&quot; is for dogs, not conceptual beings.  It simply doesn't work, 
<BR>
except as a possible deterent, for people.  All crimes are crimes against 
<BR>
someone, constituting an injustice, and thereby creating a debt.  Criminal 
<BR>
law is criminal.  It doesn't correct the injustice, the debt still exists, 
<BR>
but is artificially expunged by state fiat in most cases, often leaving the 
<BR>
victims worse off for the process.  Criminal or &quot;positive&quot; law is the law of 
<BR>
the conqueror, without signigicant historical exception, to my knowledge.
<BR>
<P>The Northern Europpean peoples used variations of the &quot;common law&quot; to settle 
<BR>
disputes, until the Romans and their philosophical/societal progeny, such as 
<BR>
the Normans, imposed the conqueror's law.  The common law did not have a 
<BR>
criminal division.  All cases were civil.  Justice, in the purest sense of 
<BR>
restoring what had been taken from the proper owner, was the goal. There was 
<BR>
no &quot;punishment,&quot; and &quot;rehabilitation&quot; occurred as someone - friend, priest 
<BR>
or family member, typically - saw it in their interest to try to councel 
<BR>
some sense into the malefactor.  This system worked brilliantly and avoided 
<BR>
the endless feuds that criminal law always brings with it.
