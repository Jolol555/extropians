&nbsp;Judge Walter Smith claimed that tests to determine if 
<BR>
&nbsp;FLIR video taken over Waco shows gunshots directed at 
<BR>
&nbsp;Mt. Carmel must be top secret to protect the &quot;national 
<BR>
&nbsp;security concerns&quot; of the British government, which 
<BR>
&nbsp;loaned the FBI the FLIR camera used (see the St. Louis 
<BR>
&nbsp;Post-Dispatch, 2/14/00). However, four days later the 
<BR>
&nbsp;Dallas Morning News (2/18/00) reported that the British 
<BR>
&nbsp;government said they had no national security concerns 
<BR>
&nbsp;regarding their FLIR technology. The fact that the 
<BR>
&nbsp;reason judge Smith had cited for keeping the tests top 
<BR>
&nbsp;secret was terminated did not thwart his determination
<BR>
&nbsp;to keep those tests secret. Now his excuse seems to be 
<BR>
&nbsp;that the public has no constitutional right to know:

<P>Public Access at Waco Test Nixed 
<BR>
<P>By Michelle Mittelstadt

<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court-ordered field test that 
<BR>
will re-enact aspects of the 1993 Waco siege to 
<BR>
determine whether federal agents fired any shots 
<BR>
into the Branch Davidians' retreat will be closed 
<BR>
to the media, a federal judge ruled Friday. 
<BR>
<P>U.S. District Judge Walter Smith of Waco rejected 
<BR>
news organizations' argument that the test, due to 
<BR>
be held next weekend at Fort Hood in Texas, should 
<BR>
be open as a matter of public interest. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The court has determined that the media have 
<BR>
identified no constitutional or common-law right 
<BR>
that would entitle them to access to this procedure,&quot; 
<BR>
Smith wrote. &quot;Pre-trial matters are not public
<BR>
components of a civil trial.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The judge, who ordered the test and is presiding 
<BR>
over surviving Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit 
<BR>
against the government, said the test &quot;may be 
<BR>
likened to a crime scene, which unquestionably 
<BR>
may be closed to the public and the press in 
<BR>
order to preserve the integrity of the evidence.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>In a motion filed earlier this month, The Associated 
<BR>
Press, Dallas Morning News, The New York Times and St. 
<BR>
Louis Post-Dispatch said a private field test &quot;will 
<BR>
only increase the public's skepticism about whether 
<BR>
all the facts surrounding the Branch Davidian raid 
<BR>
have been completely and accurately disclosed.&quot; The 
<BR>
Waco Tribune-Herald also pressed for public access. 
<BR>
<P>John Danforth, a former senator appointed special 
<BR>
counsel by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate 
<BR>
the government's conduct during the Davidians' 1993 
<BR>
standoff with federal agents, argued against media
<BR>
attendance. &quot;The quickest way to discredit an 
<BR>
investigation is to provide the media with selective 
<BR>
information during its course,&quot; the special counsel 
<BR>
wrote in a motion. 
<BR>
<P>The government and Davidians' lawyers did not oppose 
<BR>
public access. 
<BR>
<P>A lawyer representing the news organizations expressed 
<BR>
disappointment with the judge's order. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I don't believe Judge Smith or the special counsel 
<BR>
have identified any reason that justifies shrouding 
<BR>
this field test in secrecy,&quot; Dallas attorney John 
<BR>
Gerhart said. &quot;This test goes to a critical issue of 
<BR>
whether or not the government fired weapons during 
<BR>
the raid. And continued secrecy on such a critical 
<BR>
point should not be allowed unless compelling 
<BR>
circumstances force that secrecy.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Davidians' lead counsel said the public interest 
<BR>
would have been served by an open test. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I just think it's unfortunate for the process because 
<BR>
inevitably there will be some people who will read 
<BR>
into this some sinister purpose, which is really not 
<BR>
there,&quot; said Houston lawyer Michael Caddell. &quot;I do 
<BR>
think there would be a tremendous benefit created by 
<BR>
having press access and having someone that people 
<BR>
would view as not having any agenda other than to 
<BR>
report the facts.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The government has long denied that its agents fired 
<BR>
shots on April 19, 1993, during the waning hours of a 
<BR>
51-day siege. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 
<BR>
80 followers died during the inferno that occurred
<BR>
several hours into an FBI tank-and-tear gas operation 
<BR>
designed to flush the sect members from their retreat. 
<BR>
<P>Lawyers for the Davidian plaintiffs, whose case goes 
<BR>
to trial in mid-May, contend the FBI's aerial infrared 
<BR>
surveillance footage offers definitive proof of gunfire 
<BR>
directed into the building as it burned. 
<BR>
<P>The field test, which will use a British Royal Navy 
<BR>
helicopter equipped with an infrared camera much like 
<BR>
the one used by the FBI in 1993, is designed to determine 
<BR>
whether bursts of light on the Waco infrared footage 
<BR>
represent gunfire. 
<BR>
<P>Weapons similar to those carried by the Davidians and 
<BR>
federal agents will be fired during the test. Military 
<BR>
tanks like those used in 1993 also will be deployed.
