<EM>&gt;I'd be suprised if the 'typical&quot; extropian wasn't atypical in relation to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest the population.  Not that we might be similar to each other either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps our only similiarity is our difference from the norm.
</EM><BR>
<P>That reminds me of a tract I read some time ago from a colleague's tribute to
<BR>
Max Planck, the founder of quantum physics:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Many kinds of men devote themselves to the many communities of science,
<BR>
and not all for the sake of science. Various indeed are the men who dwell there
<BR>
and the motives that have led them there. Some take to science because it offers
<BR>
them the opportunity to display their particular talents. To this class of men
<BR>
science is a kind of sport in the practice of which they exult, and to which
<BR>
they look for vivid experiences and the satisfaction of ambition. Another class
<BR>
of men are in science to make an offering of their brain pulp in the hope of
<BR>
securing a profitable return. These men are scientists only by the chance of
<BR>
some circumstance which offered itself when making a choice of career. If the
<BR>
attending circumstances had been different, they might have become politicians
<BR>
or captains of business. Were the spirit of truth to come and drive those
<BR>
belonging to these two categories from the halls of science, the halls would be
<BR>
noticeably emptier, but there would still be some men left. To these latter
<BR>
belongs our Planck. And that is why we love him.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, science
<BR>
would never have existed any more than one can have a wood consisting of nothing
<BR>
but creepers. Those who have found favor with the spirit of truth are somewhat
<BR>
odd, uncommunicative, solitary fellows, really less like each other than the
<BR>
hosts of the rejected.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What has brought them to science... no single answer will cover... escape
<BR>
from Eveready life, with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the
<BR>
fetters of one's own shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape
<BR>
from his noisy cramped surroundings into the silence of the high mountains where
<BR>
the eye ranges freely through the still pure air and fondly traces out the
<BR>
restful contours apparently built for eternity.&quot;
