<BR>
<EM>&gt; 	the debate revolves around the creation of a _power_ -- an entity that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has no further charactrization than near infinite power and incrutability.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like this definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; den otter, an inscrutable power, at the very best, is neutral to human beings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is, we can only regard its potential actions as random. from this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perspective, a _power_ is little different from an detonating fusion bomb. at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the worst, den otter fears that the continuance of existence is an universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal of all existent entities, and as such, may direct the _power_ to pursue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the extermination of human beings as an explicit subgoal. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;detonating fusion bomb&quot; isn't a good analogy (not sure whether it
<BR>
is yours or den Otter's), because that is guaranteed to be destructive.
<BR>
If part of the definition of the Power is that its actions cannot be
<BR>
predicted or understood, then the problem is we don't know if it will
<BR>
be destructive or not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	yudkowsky, on the other hand, contends that the potential actions of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _power_, while uncertain, is not random even from the present human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perspective. his intuition is that something resembling morality is embeded in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the deep structure of reality; therefore, a sufficiently intelligent being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have access to that knowledge and entertain a chance of preserving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humanity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think, instead, that Eliezer believes that there is such a system of
<BR>
morality, but not that it necessarily has any relation to our own ideas.
<BR>
A moral Power may wipe us out, but if so, that was the right thing to do.
<BR>
I haven't heard of anyone besides Eliezer who finds this comforting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; every agrees that the reasoning of a _power_ would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incomprehensible to any human being -- one would have no way of verifying its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motives -- only through a priori knowledge of the fabric of reality could one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retain some peace of mind in the presence of a _power_.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, the problem is that virtually no one here beyond Eliezer believes
<BR>
in this notion of absolute morality, in fact most of us think the idea is
<BR>
incoherent (unable to be defined consistently).  So it does not appear
<BR>
that any empirical knowledge will help resolve the quandary, certainly
<BR>
not in the relevant time frame.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From an outsider's perspective, the argument between Eliezer and den
</EM><BR>
Otter is not very important.  Both of them share assumptions that seem
<BR>
questionable, namely, that they have any significant say in the outcome.
<BR>
Bill Joy wrote his jeremiad calling for a halt to progress, but that's
<BR>
a feather to dam the flood.  Likewise for Elizer and den Otter's little
<BR>
tempest.
<BR>
<P>Economic growth and technical progress is driving us forward regardless
<BR>
of what these two people decide.  Given the complexity of the world and
<BR>
the range of talents and abilities that exist, the notions that one or
<BR>
the other of them is going to become or create the first Power is simply
<BR>
a fantasy.  Our future is not in the hands of these two, but depends
<BR>
on the industrial, academic and military research being performed in
<BR>
thousands of labs all over the world.
