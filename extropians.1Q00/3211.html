Oops. I accidentally sent my reply to James Swayze and not the list in general.

<P>Here it is again, for all:

<P><EM>&gt; What psychological torments could you devise for John Wayne Gecy or Ted Bundy?

<P>I wouldn't torment them at all. If you could resurrect people who unknowingly 
<BR>
spread the black death and killed hundreds as a result, how would you punish 
<BR>
them?  You wouldn't.  You would just make sure that when you resurected them, 
<BR>
they weren't carriers anymore. By the same token, if we resurect Ted Bundy, 
<BR>
we'll cure him of whatever twisted impulse caused him to commit those crimes. 
<BR>
Remember, before we can achieve trancendance, psychology will have to become a 
<BR>
hard science. (Your can't improve what you can't understand.) The consequences 
<BR>
of this seem often not to be sufficiently appreciated by members of this list. 
<BR>
When most folks hurt others, they are reacting to internal torments of their 
<BR>
own. If you can cure those torments, they'll get better.
