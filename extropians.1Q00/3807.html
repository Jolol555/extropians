<BR>
<P><P><P>By LIDIA WASOWICZ, UPI Science Writer
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- Scientists who have unlocked
<BR>
the secret of a protein molecule that can slow aging in yeast by turning
<BR>
off selected sections of its genetic machinery want to know whether the
<BR>
same key could open the door to longer lifespans for men and women.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The hope is that researchers may one day be able to intervene
<BR>
in, and possibly inhibit, the aging process in humans,&quot; said lead study
<BR>
author Leonard Guarente, professor of biology at the Massachusetts
<BR>
Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While much work remains, including a corroboration of the
<BR>
results in animals, &quot;our findings keep this hope alive,&quot; he told United
<BR>
Press International.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research may provide the missing link that ties together
<BR>
previous results showing that yeast with extra copies of the protein
<BR>
Silent Information Regulator, SIR2, live longer, that decreased metabolic
<BR>
rates extend longevity and that cutting back on calories slows metabolism
<BR>
and adds years to one's life.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The new finding connects longevity, the silencing of gene
<BR>
expression and the slowing of metabolic state,&quot; Guarente said in an
<BR>
interview.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have shown reducing caloric intake can extend
<BR>
lifespan, although the mechanism for this correlation has been unclear,
<BR>
the scientists said in the British journal Nature. SIR2 might be the link
<BR>
between energy metabolism and longevity, turning genes off in response to
<BR>
reduced energy levels, they suggested.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So far, we have shown the connection between silencing and
<BR>
longevity in yeast, a simple system. The silencing is keeping the genome
<BR>
stable; it is genome instability that causes aging,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;We
<BR>
don't know if this is true in humans.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the year is out, the investigators expect to have
<BR>
gained key insight into whether SIR2 controls aging in animals, notably
<BR>
mice, which normally live two to three years, and worms, with a
<BR>
two-to-three-week lifespan. They plan to insert an extra copy of SIR2 in
<BR>
the animals to determine if it will enable them to live longer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;With the worm's short longevity, especially, we can get a
<BR>
view of the aging picture rapidly,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;If we find SIR2
<BR>
regulates aging in animals, we will know we are on track.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any success in slowing the aging process will have
<BR>
far-reaching repercussions on human health, the scientists said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If we slow down aging, we will slow down the diseases closely
<BR>
associated with aging, such as osteoporosis. The whole point would be to
<BR>
reduce the period of morbidity,&quot; Guarente said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Does this mean we could be immortal? No, but it does mean
<BR>
some of the diseases of aging could be curtailed so that we could play
<BR>
tennis and feel healthier and lead more active lives longer.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the animal tests corroborate the early findings, the next
<BR>
phase would be to design an anti-aging drug and to test it on worms, he
<BR>
said, emphasizing any such pill would slow down -- not reverse -- the
<BR>
aging process.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our goals are very much in the spirit of modern medicine --
<BR>
to increase the human health span,&quot; Guarente said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the yeast experiment, the researchers found the anti-aging
<BR>
enzyme has its spell-binding effect by turning off entire sections of the
<BR>
genome, the complete set of an organism's genes, said study co-author
<BR>
Shin-ichiro Imai, postdoctoral associate in biology.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study gives scientists a better understanding of previous
<BR>
findings that restricting caloric intake to 70 percent of normal levels
<BR>
significantly extends the lifespans of yeast, earthworms, mice and
<BR>
possibly primates, the authors said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the first concrete indication that genome silencing
<BR>
and metabolism are connected,&quot; Guarente said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proteins related to SIR2, discovered in the yeast
<BR>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- where it is involved in turning off genes --
<BR>
have been found in mammals, including man, the scientists said. What
<BR>
remains to be seen is whether adding extra copies of the molecule to the
<BR>
higher lifeforms will produce the same life-extending results it did in
<BR>
the simple system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team discovered SIR2 is a type of histone deacetylase, an
<BR>
enzyme which turns off gene production by modifying the so-called
<BR>
&quot;chromatin&quot; proteins, those that package and protect chromosomes,
<BR>
thread-like structures that transmit genetic inheritance from parent to
<BR>
offspring.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each cell, some genes are active and others silenced. Skin
<BR>
and brain cells, for example, are genetically identical -- the difference
<BR>
lies in their prebirth programming to produce certain genes but not
<BR>
others. SIR2 can influence which gene groups are permanently silenced,
<BR>
the end result being prevention of age-related problems that surface late
<BR>
in life, the scientists said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As cells age, genes that had always been turned off sometimes
<BR>
get turned on, causing problems that can lead to cell death,&quot; Guarente
<BR>
said, noting SIR2 would prevent such activation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their surprise, the scientists observed that to carry out
<BR>
its life-prolonging function, SIR2 requires the ubiquitous energy carrier
<BR>
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, which is normally involved in
<BR>
the breakdown of food molecules, said study co-author Christopher
<BR>
Armstrong.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by all cells, these co-enzymes help transfer electrons
<BR>
and hydrogen in some reactions that reduce oxidation, said study
<BR>
co-author Matt Kaeberlein, noting studies have linked food high in
<BR>
anti-oxidants to lower cancer rates and slowed aging.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Although NAD and NADH are frequent enzyme co-factors in
<BR>
oxidation-reduction reactions, this is the first example to our knowledge
<BR>
in which NAD drives a distinct enzymatic reaction,&quot; the authors wrote.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The NAD connection came out of the blue, but it has an
<BR>
interesting implication: NAD could well be the signal for the metabolic
<BR>
status of cells,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;If an organism is starved for calories,
<BR>
the NAD level may go up. More NAD means activating SIR2, which silences
<BR>
sections of the genome and increases lifespan.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since genes similar to SIR2 have been found in numerous
<BR>
organisms, Guarente said, the hope is &quot;if we can keep SIR2 active for
<BR>
longer, we may slow down aging.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research was funded by the Human Frontier Science Program
<BR>
Organization, the National Institutes of Health, the Seaver Foundation,
<BR>
Ellison Medical Foundation and the Howard and Linda Stern Fund.
