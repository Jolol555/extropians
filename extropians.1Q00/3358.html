<P><EM>&gt; Following up on QueeneMuse's interesting question about what the uploading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience will be like, one of the things I wonder about is what sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life we (plain, trans-, or post-)humans will be allowed by the electronic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligences (I prefer the term EI to AI) once they take over.  That will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depend, of course, on the nature of their ethical or moral systems.  I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's a safe bet to say that they will be driven by a desire to acquire and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analyze data.  I believe they will pick up the baton and run with the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific attempt to formulate a grand unified theory of everything.
</EM><BR>
<P>SInce I'm a proponent of the soft slow upload (i.e humans slowly augmenting
<BR>
their brains over time until when the brain dies, the mind doesn't notice), my
<BR>
opinion is that we will not notice any significant differences other than
<BR>
greater abilities. New and increased abilities will still feel like they are
<BR>
'our' abilities, not those of some machine we drive like a car or run like a
<BR>
computer. Recent R&amp;D on implants (cochlear and optical) shows that our minds
<BR>
consider silicon implants to be just one more part of our minds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But what else (if anything) will motivate them?  Will there be any &quot;good&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for them other than information?  Any &quot;evil&quot; other than ignorance?  Will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they care at all about such trivialities as emotion, fairness, compassion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and pain?  Whether or not I want to survive the ascendancy of strong EI will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depend largely upon this question.  Unfortunately I'll never know the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answers unless and until I survive to that time.  Or unless I am persuaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the musings of this list.  I can't wait to hear your thoughts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Based on my arguments above, I think that since uploaded humans will continue to
<BR>
think of themselves as human, that their motivations will be very similar as
<BR>
they are now, there will merely be increased growth and maturity in an uploaded
<BR>
humans thinking. Because the uploaded human will have greater access to
<BR>
information and capacity to make rational decisions, human society will become
<BR>
closer to the Baysean ideal, so less strife and stupidity will of course occur
<BR>
(except that by those who refuse to augment themselves, of course), although I
<BR>
don't know if it will dissapear entirely. For example, those who attempt to form
<BR>
borganismsin a coercive manner will be fiercely opposed by extropians (extropy
<BR>
being the individualist form of transhumanism in general). Feral humans will of
<BR>
course paint all transhumans with the scary BORG propaganda brush (much as
<BR>
libertarians get painted with the same 'right wing nut' label as religious
<BR>
conservatives), and Borganists will label feralists as 'reactionary luddite
<BR>
barbarians' and libertarians as merely 'reactionary anarchists'.
