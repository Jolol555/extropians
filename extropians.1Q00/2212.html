<EM>&gt; It means that you get a trial by people with randomly-distributed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positions in the social power structure, as opposed to a trial by your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local duke.  Your relative intelligence and viewing habits are entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant to this principle.  What matters is that you're not being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried by an aristocracy, by the same people who pass the laws, or by any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other power group that might have an interest in convicting you.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppose the jury selection process could theoretically wind up with your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being tried entirely by members of the state legislature or some other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power group, but to create social stability it only has to work most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since attorneys and judges are able to disqualify jurors in the US, the
<BR>
selection is not truly random.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, &quot;the public&quot;, in the genuine sense of twelve random people picked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off the street, might count as a power group interested in imposing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; injustice on you.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the selection were truly random, it would be hard for a special interest
<BR>
group to take over a jury.  It would happen in some cases, I'm sure, but for
<BR>
any particular jury the odds would be low.
<BR>
<P>One might also look into sortition as a method for selecting elected
<BR>
officials.  Sigmund Knag's &quot;Let's Toss ofr It: A Surprising Curb on
<BR>
Political Greed.&quot;  How might this work?  If, e.g., ten people are running
<BR>
for a given office, one might randomly select three from that group and then
<BR>
have one of those three elected by the conventional means.  An almost
<BR>
opposite way of doing this is possible.  Allow the voters to choose X number
<BR>
of people to &quot;run&quot; for an office, then randomly select one of those people
<BR>
to get that office.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This does constitute an undesirable flaw in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, but the system does work fairly well, it was a major improvement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the previous system, and there is no obvious way to eliminate said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flaw without introducing other ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>I question this.  The previous system, for us in America, was the
<BR>
Anglo-Saxon judge system.  The reason juries became the rule in England was
<BR>
because the Normans wanted to dilute the power of the Anglo-Saxon judges.
<BR>
(See Bruce L, Benson's _The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State_.)
<BR>
So, the origin of the modern jury system was not an improvement per se.
<BR>
<P>However, I do not take this as an indictment of the jury system as such.  I
<BR>
think it's pretty good overall, though I do think jury service should not be
<BR>
forced and a system of professional jurors would be much better.  I also
<BR>
think private courts would be better too, but then I'd be doing radical
<BR>
surgery and that should be the subject for a whole thread in itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After all, twelve random people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off the street have a private interest in putting murderers in jail; how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you distinguish between this and the private interest involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; racial or religious hate?  The Constitutional answer, that there has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a law passed by a deliberative body *and* a willing jury, is probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as close as you can get without an observer-independent method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguishing between good laws and bad laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>I question this too.  The problem is the cultural milieu.  If you live in
<BR>
Nazi Germany in, say, 1938 a jury would probably fall in lockstep with the
<BR>
legal framework there and would make extremely non-objective rulings.  Of
<BR>
course, I have offer not solution to that problem -- except changing the
<BR>
culture, which takes us again outside the scope of the jury system.:)
