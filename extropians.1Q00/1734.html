My suggestion overall is an explicit social contract.  The internet is still 
<BR>
international and non-jurisdictional in a way that would make it possible 
<BR>
for everyone who so desired to be signatories to a document that would spell 
<BR>
out such essentials as the agreed upon method of dispute resolution.  In 
<BR>
many jurisdictions, such as California, such a contract, say specifying 
<BR>
binding arbitration by the rules of the American Arbitration Society - or 
<BR>
anything that satisfies the rather loose specifications set out by the CA 
<BR>
courts, would be legally binding upon all signatories, taking all disputes 
<BR>
out of the state courts altogether.
<BR>
<P>Such a contract, backed up by available market safeguards and remedies - 
<BR>
bonding, escrow, letters of credit, etc., - could quickly and easily evolve 
<BR>
into a worldwide legal framework that could ultimately supplant the state 
<BR>
itself.  Within such a framework, it is possible to spell out subcontracts 
<BR>
to explicitly handle issues such as title to intellectual property, remedies 
<BR>
for violations, etc., all without involving state coercion.  Signatories 
<BR>
would get preferred access to a particular market.  Non-signatories would 
<BR>
pay up front for the risk they created.  A kind of historic precedent exists 
<BR>
in the common law versus various formulations of contract law or Admiralty 
<BR>
Law.  (I am NOT an expert in these details, however.)
<BR>
<P>Such a contract could provide the kind of protection and risk management 
<BR>
that would allow for the rapid building of trust between participants 
<BR>
worldwide.  There are vast investment opportunities today that have to be 
<BR>
foregone simply because of risk factors that such a universal contract could 
<BR>
eliminate.
<BR>
<P>The problem now, as I understand it, is largely &quot;positive law.&quot;  Positive 
<BR>
law is always the law of the conqueror.  A good example is when the Normans 
<BR>
took over England. They couldn't very well keep the Anglo-Saxon common-law 
<BR>
courts - they would have been sued to death!  But they had to win some level 
<BR>
of trust from the subjects.  So they introduced courts that retained much of 
<BR>
the form of the old courts, but with their own hand-picked judges, and new 
<BR>
law.
<BR>
<P>Under the good and ancient common law, the jury was sovereign.  Juries MADE 
<BR>
the law.  Judges could strike out a judgement against a defendant in the 
<BR>
interest of fairness or compliance with a larger jurisdiction, but they 
<BR>
couldn't increase the judgement.  They could not instruct the jury on what 
<BR>
evidence to consider, nor tell them that they could only judge the facts, 
<BR>
not the law.  A conqueror obviously could not tolerate such a system.  So, 
<BR>
positive law - explicit law laid down by rulers - was introduced and juries 
<BR>
became more and more limited to ruling simply on whether someone was guilty 
<BR>
of violating that set of rules from the rulers.
<BR>
<P>Under the original common law, all cases were civil, not criminal.  Criminal 
<BR>
law, once again, became necessary when you have to punish a subject 
<BR>
population.  Under the common law, even a murderer was literally expected to 
<BR>
PAY for his crime - spending the rest of his life supporting widows, kids, 
<BR>
parents, etc. that were victims of his action.  But such a system is rather 
<BR>
useless for detering victimless crimes, such as criticizing the ruler, or 
<BR>
having the wrong kind of sex, or using the wrong inebrients, etc.  So the 
<BR>
positive law system holds out the incentive in a democracy of imposing the 
<BR>
will of the majority ruling coalition on everyone else, regardless of any 
<BR>
actual harm.  The result is that the U.S. today has both the highest 
<BR>
percentage and largest total number of people incarcerated in the entire 
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P>Today, on top of law dictated to serve special interest, we have crooked 
<BR>
cops, crooked prosecutors, crooked judges, sadistic jailors,  all part of 
<BR>
enforcing the desires of the current ruling coalitions vai positive law.  In 
<BR>
a purely contractual society, which is what I want to move closer to, the 
<BR>
jurors or arbitrators will not get picked to serve unless they have the 
<BR>
reputation to deliver judgements that all parties can live with.
<BR>
<P>Instead of criminals versus non-criminals, there will be credit ratings, 
<BR>
different for different markets.  Silly, arbitrary constructs like our 
<BR>
current patent, copyright system would simply not be tolerated.  Any market 
<BR>
that tried to impose such constraints would be quickly abandoned, in favor 
<BR>
of markets that granted reasonable contractual protection for intellectual 
<BR>
property.
