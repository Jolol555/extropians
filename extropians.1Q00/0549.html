<P><EM>&gt; Ahh, I can't help you with that, but I'd suggest that the major economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue at play here is a furthering shift in the economy towards information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (in this case, the software that drives MNT) as the pivotal resource.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and no.  There are very subtle forces at work.  Software (and petaflops
<BR>
computing) drive the simulations to know the designs work.  They also drive
<BR>
the &quot;HAD&quot; (human aided design).  Auto-ComputerDesign requires very new software
<BR>
(see my Nano@home suggestions).
<BR>
<P>But, we now have designs that have been simulated and we believe would work
<BR>
(from Inst. for Molecular Manufacturing).  The best we can do at this point
<BR>
is &quot;play&quot; with the molecules nature has handed us.  So, a molecular assembler,
<BR>
is critical.  The breaktrough in '99 was molecular nano-chemistry.  What
<BR>
we need next is demonstrable, marketable parallel AFMs.
<BR>
<P>Now, on the biotech front, we are going to have progammable, self-replicating
<BR>
machines *very* soon (1-3 years).  The only problem will be they will not
<BR>
be &quot;general purpose&quot;.  They will only be able to do things substantively
<BR>
similar to those already done.  That pretty much confines you to chemical
<BR>
factories or energy conversion.  Building macro-scale things in a robust
<BR>
way (think programmable trees/bones/sea shells for &quot;houses&quot;), is going to
<BR>
take much longer (10-15 years).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd guess that the ramifications of this shift have been examined ad nauseum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in academic papers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, academia unfortunately tends to narrow ones perspective.  I can
<BR>
only think of three relatively polymathic people (Robin Hanson, Robert
<BR>
Freitas and Eric, with perhaps Ralph &amp; Josh close behind) who understand
<BR>
the technology sufficiently and have enough background in other areas
<BR>
to begin to wrestle with the trends and tradeoffs in detail.  People
<BR>
like Moravec, Kurzweil and Minsky have made contributions, but they
<BR>
don't really understand the trends in biotech &amp; health sufficiently
<BR>
because of their specializations.  Michio Kaku is one of the best
<BR>
&quot;futurists&quot; around, in terms of his technical competence and general
<BR>
grasp of trends, but even he doesn't &quot;grok&quot; nanotech and much of biotech.
<BR>
<P>Other than that, Damien and the authors of the Cyberhumanity book are on
<BR>
the cutting edge.  They are creating mounds of work for the academics
<BR>
who will spend years sorting this all out.

<EM>&gt; &gt; some urls to papers (like those of ESR on open source software) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; explicitly and professionally analyzed the topic. I don't know of any,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aside from some elaborate plans for paths to AI (rather than nano) in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; various of Eli's sub-sites, and comments by Robin Hanson on  the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; economics of unlimited uploading, and like that. Maybe it hasn't been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; done yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as I know, you are correct.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'd have expected the Foresight folks to have a batch of documents on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; topic, though (but I haven't fallen over any of them yet).
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
My general impression is that Foresight to date has focused most of its
<BR>
energy on surviving and recruiting a foundational support group.  We still
<BR>
have quite a ways to go before we can produce the resources to look at
<BR>
these things in detail.  There is still quite a bit of effort going into
<BR>
discovering the best way to share the knowledge required to begin to discuss
<BR>
these trends in detail (witness the exploration of the Group Genius weekends).
<BR>
<P>However, a focus discussion of the multiple paths for an afternoon might be
<BR>
a very useful topic for Extro5.
<BR>
<P>How about:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extro5: Riding the Wave..
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extro5: Shooting the Rapids...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extro5: What to do when your bungee cord snaps....
