A true gentlebluntperson and knight of the extropian realm, Lord Robert 
<BR>
Bradbury wrote:
<BR>
Soooo, thou doth seekest to steal the crown of bluntness.
<BR>
Well, I say, &quot;nay kind gentlebluntperson&quot;, thou mayst only posess the
<BR>
crown of bluntness whenst thoust has proved thy worthy bluntness.
<BR>
I see around me, a field filled with torn and broken memes that
<BR>
are slowly rotting having attempted to assault my bluntness.
<BR>
<P>I see in the distance, several other Extropian Knights whose
<BR>
bluntness may even exceed mine own, but while their bluntness
<BR>
is directed towards a singular focus, my bluntness is reknowned
<BR>
for its few limits.  [Recall if you will an incident at Extro4...]
<BR>
<P>So, if thoust desire the Crown of Bluntness, bearing in mind that
<BR>
one should never join a club that would have you as a member,
<BR>
then thoust needeth offer a greater claim than a single soliloquy.
<BR>
However, Jeff Davis, you clearly have within you the material of
<BR>
a fine and scholarly bluntperson.  I think we may confidently nominate
<BR>
you for the position of bluntperson's apprentice.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Robert, this gets my award for wit and creative writing skills!  I 
<BR>
absolutely loved it.  I thought Eliezer was the undisputed master of this 
<BR>
sort of thing but not so!  For those of us who could not make it to Extro 4, 
<BR>
could you tell us about whatever you are referring to?
<BR>
<P>I hope what sparked all of this creativity (cryonics feasibility) is in fact 
<BR>
feasible.  I still say more research into improved suspension technologies 
<BR>
needs to be done.  At the very least for the peace of mind of many 
<BR>
cryonicists!  I am not so sure that mature nanotech will be able to repair 
<BR>
the brain structure damage done by current suspension methods.  What did you 
<BR>
think of the Mike Darwin paper I brought to your attention?  I look forward 
<BR>
to Eugene Leitl's forthcoming study.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
