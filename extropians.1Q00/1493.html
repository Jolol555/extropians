<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I saw this TV news segment the other day that had some disturbing &gt;news
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about AIDS in Africa. In one part, it said that tribal medicine men &gt;were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telling HIV+ males that having sex with young girls (preferably &gt;virgins)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would cure them. To me, this relates to the idea of children as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'poison box', explained at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.psychohistory.com/05_history.html">http://www.psychohistory.com/05_history.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Further, of course, there is the continuing practice of female
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circumcision which has been linked to the spread of AIDS.  Combining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this with intolerance between different tribal groups and recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genocides in Africa it suggests to me that Africa retains cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects which is very dangerous to long-term survivability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Any thoughts?
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as the &quot;sex with a virgin as a cure for HIV&quot; goes, the same most 
<BR>
unfortunate, unbelievably sad belief exists in India, as well.  HIV-positive 
<BR>
men sometimes go to brothels and request a virgin, as they think that having 
<BR>
sex with one will somehow pass the virus from themselves into the hapless 
<BR>
young girl.  The chances are high that the virgin will indeed contract the 
<BR>
virus, because of the tearing and rupturing of tissue that occurs with the 
<BR>
breaking of the hymen.  The men who do this are highly ignorant, obviously, 
<BR>
but they're also highly immoral, to want to pass a deadly disease to another 
<BR>
person, to save their sorry selves.
<BR>
<P>As far as Africa and its multitude of problems, an excellent and highly 
<BR>
readable book to start with is &quot;Out of America: A Black Man Confronts 
<BR>
Africa&quot;, by Keith D. Richburg.  This brave individual has really laid bare 
<BR>
the soul of the continent of his ancestry in this book.  Here's the Amazon 
<BR>
link:

<BR>
<P>Another which comes highly recommended, but which I haven't had a chance to 
<BR>
read yet, is George B.N. Ayittey's &quot;Africa in Chaos&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Africa retains cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects which [are] very dangerous to long-term survivability
</EM><BR>
Agreed.
<BR>
<P>The article you referenced looks very interesting at first glance; no time 
<BR>
to read and comment on it at the moment.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
