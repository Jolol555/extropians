<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Is there any actual historical evidence that JC even existed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; EvMick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  The most obvious, or famous, evidence is the New Testament, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally apart&gt; &gt;  from whether one considers the New Testament to have
</EM><BR>
any 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; religious&gt; &gt;  validity. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You don't consider it to be just a tiny bit biased?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Biased in the sense that it was written by Christian believers, but
<BR>
biased documents can still recount truth.  Almost any historical account
<BR>
is written with motive, or bias.  A standard challenge historians face is
<BR>
to discern the truth beyond the slant of the sources they have available.
<BR>
&nbsp;You are right to be skeptical of specific accounts, as they are almost
<BR>
all biased in some sense.  But if we ignored all biased accounts we would
<BR>
have practically nothing to go on. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Some (most?) of the books of the New Testament were allegedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Allegedly.....key word here...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  written by Apostles of Christ who knew him personally during his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life,&gt; &gt;  and were written down in contemporary Greek within a couple
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; hundred&gt; &gt;  years of the lifetime of Jesus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; not exactly an eyewitness account....&quot;he said that he said that she 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said that &gt; he said.....for a couple of hundred years?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>Well, the original writings were for the most part set down during their
<BR>
own lifetimes by those who had been in personal contact with Jesus or if
<BR>
not were nearly contemporary with Jesus and among the earliest
<BR>
Christians.  So the New Testament is for the most part not purported to
<BR>
be multi-level hearsay.  Many of the books of the New Testament are
<BR>
actual letters which were written down directly by the author and
<BR>
dispatched to distant Christian communities, who then carefully saved the
<BR>
letters out of respect for the writer and the writing, much as a modern
<BR>
American might save a letter from, say, President Kennedy, and perhaps
<BR>
frame it and keep it on the wall.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you missed my point is suppose...  Is there any independent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical evidence that JC existed?   
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ah.  You asked for evidence, so I thought of the New Testament, which is
<BR>
well-known and highly accessible, not realizing that you wanted evidence
<BR>
from sources other than adherents of Christianity.
<BR>
<P><P>Is his existence mentioned by 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary Roman historians for example?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Good question.  Jesus was put to death in a manner used for common
<BR>
criminals, but for largely political reasons, because he was becoming
<BR>
very popular, what with going around performing miracles and attracting
<BR>
large admiring crowds among the Jews, many of whom resented Roman rule. 
<BR>
But then the imperial Romans were commonly executing subversives and
<BR>
rebels, so the killing of Jesus would not have seemed very noteworthy at
<BR>
the time by observers in Rome.  But later, when Christianity spread to
<BR>
Rome itself, and the authorities tried to suppress it, there was a
<BR>
mounting crisis which ended in the conversion to Christianity of the
<BR>
Emperor Constantine, whereupon Christianity went from being a banned
<BR>
religion to being the official state religion.  Surely that would have
<BR>
been a major news item of the time, and indeed it is commonly accepted
<BR>
today as historical fact.  But actual verbatim contemporary accounts may
<BR>
be hard to come by due to the widespread destruction and loss of
<BR>
documents associated with the fall of the Empire and the long Dark Ages.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Dozens, if not hundreds, of towns and other sites mentioned in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the New&gt; &gt;  Testament are identifiable today, some with a high degree
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; confidence,&gt; &gt;  with ruins and physical features which can be directly
</EM><BR>
verified &gt; in person&gt; &gt;  by a modern visitor.  Numerous artifacts of
<BR>
various types, &gt; including&gt; &gt;  pottery and hundreds of thousands if not
<BR>
millions of coins from &gt; the&gt; &gt;  general era of Jesus still exist and
<BR>
provide abundant evidence of &gt; the&gt; &gt;  historical context in which rulers
<BR>
or governors held power in &gt; particular&gt; &gt;  regions at particular times
<BR>
surrounding the places and times 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; associated&gt; &gt;  with Jesus.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And your point is?   UFO sitings routinely identify local towns?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Contextual accuracy and consistency would mostly serve to show that the
<BR>
New Testament was not, say, written by monks in Ireland in 1200 A.D. who
<BR>
were not familiar with eastern Mediterranean lands, falsely palming it
<BR>
off as ancient writings.  An account which is internally consistent and
<BR>
which meshes with other accounts of the same subject from other sources
<BR>
has more credibility than one which is inconsistent and is at odds with
<BR>
other credible writings.
