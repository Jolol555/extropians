<EM>&gt; I don't know if you're aware of this, but the atoms within the brain do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not remain constant.  I forget what the exact rate of turnover is, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like 50% of the atoms get replaced every six months.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever &quot;we&quot; are, it's clearly not the atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an oversimplification of the details.  Given the complex physical
<BR>
structure of the brain, there is a variability in the turnover rates.
<BR>
The proteins in the liver turnover at something like a 1% per hour
<BR>
rate (intracellularly).  That goes up to ~2%/hour when people are on
<BR>
caloric restriction.  In the brain, you probably get similar rates
<BR>
of turnover in the proteins around the nucleus.  Proteins and structures
<BR>
(e.g. mitochondria) in the axons or at the terminals would turnover
<BR>
on the order of days because it takes them that long to get transported
<BR>
up and down the axons.  I'm unsure of whether there is any proteosome
<BR>
activity (breaking down proteins into amino acids) in the regions of
<BR>
the synapses (Anders might comment).  The extracellular matrix and
<BR>
the lipids in the axons and cell body turn over much more slowly
<BR>
if at all.  
<BR>
<P>It may not be strictly true that the atoms get replaced (if Eliezer
<BR>
has references on this I'd like to see them).  I doubt for example
<BR>
that many of the atoms in the DNA get replaced.  It is certainly true
<BR>
that they get recycled and there may be some flow of the basic building
<BR>
blocks into and out of the brain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you scan in one neuron at a time, destroy the old neuron, and replace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it with a robotic interface to equivalent computations taking place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elsewhere, you can migrate, one neuron at a time, to the new substrate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without ever losing consciousness.  In this case, would it not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to say that the new individual is unambiguously &quot;you&quot;, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change of physical substrate as irrelevant as the turnover among your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constituent amino acids?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the Moravec/Minsky replacement approach introduced in the
<BR>
1980s.  Being conservative it should be noted that it is not clear
<BR>
that this is entirely feasible.  I've recently confirmed that
<BR>
nanobots are of the order of the same size as synapses and Nanomedicine
<BR>
suggests that they should be able to sense and modulate neurotransmitters.
<BR>
They should also be able to monitor the action potential spikes in
<BR>
the neurons.  However, until further work is done on this and someone
<BR>
comes up with a real design for doing it, this remains a hypothetical
<BR>
exercise.
<BR>
<P>The following is a great quote, so I thank E.Y. for sharing it:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;But I am not an object.  I am not a noun, I am an adjective.  I am the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way matter behaves when it is organized in a John K Clark-ish way.  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the present time only one chunk of matter in the universe behaves that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way; someday that could change.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	-- John K Clark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The emphasis in the statement should be on the &quot;could&quot;.
<BR>
<P>My personal opinion is that it should be &quot;will likely&quot;.
