<EM>		&gt;This of course raises some moral questions, like if your
</EM><BR>
present &gt;self
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;has the right to create a future self in great pain and no
</EM><BR>
way of
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;avoiding it (my answer would be that it is OK - potential
</EM><BR>
people &gt;have
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;no rights)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is mad. Potential people, surely, have at least potential rights. If
<BR>
the person comes into existence, she has the right not to be tortured,
<BR>
whether or not the torture is the result of some mechanism that was set up
<BR>
before her birth. Otherwise, it would be OK for sadists to have kids and
<BR>
then to torture and murder them at will; or your parents might one day pop
<BR>
over to your place and poke your eyes out, acting on some secret intention
<BR>
they had formed before they conceived you. That is not morally acceptable
<BR>
behaviour!
<BR>
<P>Regarding what one can morally do to a future segment on oneself, that is a
<BR>
trickier issue. You have to specify in what sense this future mind would be
<BR>
&quot;you&quot;. In the case you describe, with this mind having no memory of who the
<BR>
present self is, and no control over what decisions the other direct
<BR>
continuations of your present self are making, it seems hard to see in what
<BR>
sense this mind is you. In this case, it seems you have no more right to
<BR>
coerce this other mind than you would have to coerce a genetic clone of
<BR>
yourself.
<BR>
<P>There might be cases where a super-mind would be justified in creating
<BR>
inferior minds and then coercing them in various ways, much like we use lab
<BR>
mice, but surely only if there is an overriding motivation (say, the
<BR>
super-mind has very strong preferences). Other things equal, it would be
<BR>
morally undesirable to coerce or torture created beings, be they human
<BR>
children or artificial sentient minds.
<BR>
<P><EM>		&gt;Maybe this kind of extreme experience cognitive engineering
</EM><BR>
is &gt;going
<BR>
<EM>		&gt;to be a popular thing among the posthumans? A kind of dare,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;passage
</EM><BR>
<EM>		&gt;rite/education or just entertainment
</EM><BR>
<P>A silly right of passage that would be. Why not do something difficult but
<BR>
pleasant instead? And if it is the education we are after, couldn't we get
<BR>
that information in a less painful way, say by downloading the memory of the
<BR>
pain, or just learning about pain in general. Presumably, you think that the
<BR>
pain might somehow &quot;ennoble&quot; us emotionally; - but why not find a way of
<BR>
changing our emotional state into that &quot;noble&quot; state - of humility and
<BR>
resignation or whatever - directly, rather than go through the inefficient
<BR>
and horrendous process of getting to that state through having long series
<BR>
of painful experiences. That would be lot more transhumanist in my book!
