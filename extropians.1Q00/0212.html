<P><EM>&gt; What you describe is a situation in

<EM>&gt; prohibited from engaging in their practice.  In the Western democracies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this would not be a political but a constitutional (i.e. legal) issue, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was a remedy, it would be found in the courts, and not in social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or political action.

<P>Robert, if you accept the general premise that a THism/EIism philosophy
<BR>
is one that allows indefinate extension of ones longevity, then one may
<BR>
also want to accept that one should have a choice as to when to end
<BR>
your conscious life.  Currently that is legally prohibited in all
<BR>
but one state and a couple of countries.  As a result of that, millions
<BR>
of people are condemned to a gradual decay of their physical brain
<BR>
matter that, given our best medical knowledge, will result in an
<BR>
unrecoverable mental state! I.e., the laws are condemning &quot;selves&quot;
<BR>
to death.
<BR>
<P>So, we *are* in a state where the rational choices that EI/TH-ists would
<BR>
make are outlawed.  I remember quite well the discussions of 10-20
<BR>
years ago in the U.S., calling for a constitutional convetion to correct
<BR>
things like, income taxes, privacy rights, etc.  These may be legal or
<BR>
constitutional issues, but they *rapidly* spin over into politics.
<BR>
The requirements for electing the officials to change the constitution
<BR>
or calling a constitutional convention to make the legal changes required
<BR>
(granting new personal rights) create a *highly* political process.  The
<BR>
courts are not a viable solution if we are in the realm where the the courts
<BR>
go against our perspective or choose not to rule on various subjects.
<BR>
This in increasingly likely to be the case because we have entered
<BR>
the period where past principles are not applicable because the
<BR>
fundamental definitions have changed.  {E.g. if you make 20 copies
<BR>
of yourself, is each of them an individual with a right to vote?}
<BR>
<P>If the courts decide, your copies are not individuals with the rights
<BR>
of individuals, what will your position be and what will you do?
