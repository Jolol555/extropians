<EM>&gt; &gt; Pg. 386 of NM says the Young's Modulus is ~400 GPa for saphire and 1050
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; GPa for diamond.  But what we really need are some comparisons between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the compressive and tensile strength.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have figures, but diamond anvil compression cells are quoted as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being good up to 100 kbar, which would be about 10^8 g/cm^2, so you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use that as a ballpark upper limit for the weight that can be supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a diamond column.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been doing some research into the Gibson idea of molecular cutting 
<BR>
(&quot;molly&quot;) wire, and have been trying to research theoretical tensile 
<BR>
strengths of materials. I came across a couple of tables that gave 
<BR>
artificial diamond a (normal) tensile strength of around 2 GPa. Recent 
<BR>
experiments on multi-walled bucky tubes have given a measured strength of 
<BR>
63 GPa (&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/wusm-mmm013100.html">http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/wusm-mmm013100.html</A>&gt;) and 
<BR>
the researchers think that single-walled tubes will have 'several hundred' 
<BR>
GPa. Other researchers have apparantly posted numbers around 200 GPa, 
<BR>
which have been quoted in some newsgroups.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, does anyone know the thickness of the end of a *really* sharp 
<BR>
knife blade?  I ask this because 200 GPa is a suspension strength of 
<BR>
2,000,000 kg/cm^2 in 1g which means that a line able to lift 20 kg will 
<BR>
have a thickness of around 30 um. This hardly seems sharp enough, given 
<BR>
the ease of breaking such a wire. If I can figure out how thin molly wire 
<BR>
should be (I've always assumed 75 nm or so, which would give a test of 
<BR>
about .1 gram, which seems too low) I could come up with a required 
<BR>
tensile strength, and compare with theory, to do a reality check. Of 
<BR>
course, any pointers on figuring out how much force it takes a blade with 
<BR>
given parameters to pass through a substance with given parameters would 
<BR>
help greatly in modelling this stuff. If its sharp enough to hardly feel 
<BR>
resistance when passing through materials, maybe the wire can get away 
<BR>
with having only a few grams test.
