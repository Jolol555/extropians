<EM>&gt; &gt;Well, these (de Garis') are fake neurons. Neuronlike functional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; units, &gt;significantly less powerful than their biological counterparts. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, so they would be less powerful than a human neuron, but 100 billion is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a few times the number that a human has, tho the estimates seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase with time and better research.  A figure of 20-100 billion is
</EM><BR>
<P>I also wonder to what extent their greater speed can compensate 
<BR>
for their lesser capabilities. It's hard to imagine that a purely 
<BR>
electronic &quot;neuron&quot; wouldn't be many times faster than the 
<BR>
biological electro-chemical ones (unless there's a lot of 
<BR>
software emulation going on, but de Garis' work with FPGA's 
<BR>
suggest that it's primarily hardware). If the village idiot's 
<BR>
brain were a few orders of magnitude faster, he might not seem 
<BR>
like much of an idiot.
<BR>
<P>For that matter, imagine if an uploaded version of you were 
<BR>
running in a machine that gave your brain no added ability at 
<BR>
all, except for 3 orders of magnitude speed improvement. A 
<BR>
lifetime worth of deep thought could be accomplished in a month. 
<BR>
Imagine what a scientist, or engineer or artist could create with 
<BR>
each passing month. I think that a person of average intelligence 
<BR>
could attain greater intellectual achievements than the greatest 
<BR>
minds of history, given only that single advantage. And with the 
<BR>
performance we're seeing with electronic systems even with 
<BR>
current technology, 3 orders of magnitude seems extremely 
<BR>
conservative. The greater speed is already here, so as artificial 
<BR>
brains start to approach the complexity of biological ones, 
<BR>
things will get very interesting, very quickly.
