<P><EM>&gt;This is a work in progress.  As you can see, I've developed three categories 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of opponents of transhumanist values and goals: 1) Greens, 2) Religious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Groups and 3) Hate Groups and Opponents of Liberty. I would appreciate help 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the list in compiling this list.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Those who work to educate others about transhumanism do us all a great
<BR>
service and those who work toward eradicating misconceptions do an equal
<BR>
benefit to transhumanity.  I'm glad you are also taking on the challenge of
<BR>
researching and revealing groups that can and do oppose our beliefs. 
<BR>
<P>In that your work is in progress and you will be specifying particular
<BR>
examples and issues within groups that oppose our views, I do have two
<BR>
thoughts:  (1) Using a political group as a target to oppose may be
<BR>
overbroad, unless, however, the group is unarguably vindictive.  In that I
<BR>
was once a Green Party electee and a transhuman at the same time, I cannot
<BR>
agree with you that Greens (in general) are a threat to our culture.  It is
<BR>
the alarmist environmentalists and alarmist anti-genetic engineering
<BR>
advocates that are ridiculously and arrogantly obtuse.  
<BR>
<P>(2) I feel the same way about religious groups.  I prefer to work with
<BR>
religious groups recognizing that some are not antagonistic to us while
<BR>
also being *alert* that there are particular belief systems within specific
<BR>
religious groups that are indeed harmful. I realize that you do not include
<BR>
all religious groups under this heading but have target the one's that are
<BR>
clearly odious. 
<BR>
<P>I agree with you about Hate Groups and Opponents of Liberty, and I think
<BR>
they should be opposed fervently and look forward to seeing the references.
<BR>
<P>It's good to know our opposition are and what their agenda is.  Someone
<BR>
once said that we need to keep our friends close and our enemies even
<BR>
closer.  I'm not sure this is the best advice, but I feel very strongly
<BR>
that if we understand, if we know the mental mechanics of our opposition,
<BR>
we can better debate them, deal with them and resolve conflicts.  If we
<BR>
cannot resolve conflicts, then in the process of learning the skill of
<BR>
such, we become stronger and more aware.
<BR>
<P>Thanks Greg for your work in uncovering some opponents to the extropic
<BR>
advancements of society.
