<BR>
<P>Why Sex Matters
<BR>
A Darwinian Look at Human Behavior
<BR>
Bobbi S. Low
<BR>
<A HREF="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6684.html">http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6684.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Why are men, like other primate males, usually the aggressors 
<BR>
and risk takers? Why do women typically have fewer sexual 
<BR>
partners? Why is killing infants routine in some cultures, but 
<BR>
forbidden in others? Why is incest everywhere taboo? Bobbi Low 
<BR>
ranges from ancient Rome to modern America, from the Amazon to 
<BR>
the Arctic, and from single-celled organisms to international 
<BR>
politics to show that these and many other questions about 
<BR>
human behavior largely come down to evolution and sex. More 
<BR>
precisely, as she shows in this uniquely comprehensive and 
<BR>
accessible survey of behavioral and evolutionary ecology, they 
<BR>
come down to the basic principle that all organisms evolved to 
<BR>
maximize their reproductive success and seek resources to do 
<BR>
so.
<BR>
<P>Low begins by reviewing the fundamental arguments and 
<BR>
assumptions of behavioral ecology: selfish genes, conflicts of 
<BR>
interest, and the tendency for sexes to reproduce through 
<BR>
different behaviors. She explains why in primate species-from 
<BR>
chimpanzees and apes to humans-males seek to spread their genes 
<BR>
by devoting extraordinary efforts to finding mates, while 
<BR>
females find it profitable to expend more effort on parenting. 
<BR>
Low illustrates these sexual differences among humans by 
<BR>
showing that in places as diverse as the parishes of 
<BR>
nineteenth-century Sweden, the villages of seventeenth-century 
<BR>
China, and the forests of twentieth-century Brazil, men have 
<BR>
tended to seek power and resources, from cattle to money, to 
<BR>
attract mates, while women have sought a secure environment for 
<BR>
raising children. She makes it clear, however, they have not 
<BR>
done so simply through individual efforts or in a vacuum, but 
<BR>
that men and women act in complex ways that involve cooperation 
<BR>
and coalition building and that are shaped by culture, 
<BR>
technology, tradition, and the availability of resources. Low 
<BR>
also considers how the evolutionary drive to acquire resources 
<BR>
leads to environmental degradation and warfare and asks whether 
<BR>
our behavior could be channeled in more constructive ways.
<BR>
<P>Why Sex Matters is a compelling work of biology, sociology, and 
<BR>
anthropology and a penetrating study of the deep motivations 
<BR>
that underlie individual and social behavior.
<BR>
<P>At the University of Michigan, Bobbi S. Low is Professor of 
<BR>
Resource Ecology at the School of Natural Resources and 
<BR>
Environment, Associate Director of the Population Environment 
<BR>
Dynamics Program, and Faculty Associate at several centers 
<BR>
within the Institute for Social Research. She is an associate 
<BR>
editor for Politics and the Life Sciences and for Population 
<BR>
and Environment. She is the author, with Alice Clarke and Ken 
<BR>
Lockridge, of Family Patterns in Nineteenth-Century Sweden.
