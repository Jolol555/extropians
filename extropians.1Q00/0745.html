<P>
If my reading of the ABC News press release last night was correct,
<BR>
there seemed to be an implication of ~1 supermassive black hole
<BR>
per galaxy.  Current estimates for # of galaxy are on the order of a
<BR>
few hundred billion, so this would be about several hundred *billion*
<BR>
supermassive black holes in the universe.  The Chandra data seemed to
<BR>
suggest that big black holes might come first and serve as &quot;crystalization
<BR>
centers&quot; (matter attractors?) for the rest of the matter that makes up the galaxy.
<BR>
<P>Chandra's big find was resolving the hazy background X-ray &quot;glow&quot;
<BR>
into distinct point sources -- *very* distant point sources.
<BR>
I believe they think they are seeing high output quasars in the
<BR>
early history of the universe.  The quasars quiet down after
<BR>
they have eaten all of the nearby matter.  I believe there may
<BR>
have been confirmation of several (&lt; 10?) black holes *in*
<BR>
our galaxy, that there was previously insufficient data to confirm.
<BR>
<P>Its worth noting the distinction between the &quot;quasar&quot; class
<BR>
supermassive black holes (~1/galaxy) and the &quot;stellar&quot; class
<BR>
black holes that are left over from big stars exploding.
<BR>
What I'm unclear about is whether the paper Damien is quoting
<BR>
is refering to the supermassive black holes or some extrapolations
<BR>
of the &quot;confirmed&quot; &quot;stellar&quot; black holes in our galaxy to a galaxy
<BR>
abundance count.
<BR>
<P>I think we need a reality check here.  If we have between 200 and 400
<BR>
*billion* stars in the galaxy that means we have 1 black hole per few
<BR>
thousand stars???  This might be right but someone like Amara should
<BR>
comment on whether the Initial Stellar Mass Function distribution
<BR>
would produce supernovas resulting in black holes for ~1 in 1000 stars.
<BR>
<P>I think we need some &quot;scientific source&quot; URLs (rather than quotes from papers
<BR>
extracted from press releases).
<BR>
<P>Now, what gets interesting is the problem of seeing those black holes.
<BR>
Nanoprobes (or even non-nanoprobes) may have a hard time detecting
<BR>
them early enough to avoid falling into or being irradiated by them.
<BR>
The question is whether you have to have a Chandra-mass telescope to focus
<BR>
the incoming X-rays?  If so, you are definately no longer a nano-probe.
<BR>
So, we have yet another possible problem in the realm of interstellar
<BR>
travel (in addition to cosmic radiation and hitting dust particles).
