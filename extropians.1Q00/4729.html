<EM>&gt; &gt; McVeigh was thrown out of a militia meeting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  because of his views, and he was never a member. Buford was a nazi, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  a militia member.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MacVeigh trained with the Michigan Militia.  
</EM><BR>
<P>No. He did not. He attended one meeting and was asked to leave. McVeigh
<BR>
trained with the US Army, and later did a lot of self training, alone,
<BR>
with fuel/fertilizer explosives on the farm of his freind Terry Nichols.
<BR>
If you have any different information, cite sources, cause you aren't
<BR>
carrying any water yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bufford had ties with Ole Rev
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Butler's ladies club Hayden Lake, Idaho (Hating Lake?) Think that there's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection with them and some militias? Think again.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure racist pro-statist pukes like you would love to think so.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Who, the greenies? I beleive it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Greens have yet to successfully produce a single watt of electricty. I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsure if Amory Lovins count as Greens? But his advice has surely saved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electricity and money and still got the job done industrially.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know Amory Lovins, and no, he's not a Green. Back when I was saving
<BR>
the country a lot of electricity and getting the job done industrially
<BR>
(still doing it, all the retrofits I designed and sold are still in
<BR>
place and will be for another 20 years+).
<BR>
<P>Greens want us all to live in Kazinski-like splendor (oh, whats that?
<BR>
another terrorist....he musta been a member of the Greens Militia....why
<BR>
wouldn't he, he was violent, he hated people, and he was a lonely white
<BR>
loser living out in the hills of wyoming. He musta been militia. Had to
<BR>
be. In fact, I beleive it now, so it must be true....
