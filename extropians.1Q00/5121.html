<P>Tightly reasoned, Michael; would you agree that what is needed is
<BR>
greatly increased funding for research aimed at BOTH non-nuclear
<BR>
AND non-combustible energy generation that was cost-effective
<BR>
and bio-safe?
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I am inclined to agree with you that an objective
<BR>
risk-benefit comparative analysis of our current leading technologies
<BR>
suggests a rational preference for nuclear power.
