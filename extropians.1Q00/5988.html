<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of &quot;efficient&quot; (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot; for that matter).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That you will &quot;never be convinced&quot; suggests a position that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rational in its basis.  In fact, dumping *is* more efficient and to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;benefit of *everyone* in the long-term than doing as you suggest.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hardly call forcing a farmer to sell their grain at or below cost to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot;; it sounds like theft to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would say that *you* have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;theft.&quot;  I'm no farmer, but I'm sure that as between selling my grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; cost and just dumping it for nothing, I'd much rather do the former.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would *rather* sell it at a profit, but I would *not* consider someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; offering to pay cost for something that I otherwise plan to just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;destroy, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be a thief.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If farmers wanted to sell their product at or below cost, they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;already be doing it.  Since the only way this will happen is through force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it can be called theft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;At cost&quot; is a strawman.  The market would handle the situation just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fine if it was merely &quot;at cost&quot;.  Margins are generally quite thin so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it isn't a case of price gouging.  Most of the countries receiving grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;get it free or substantially below cost.  If they could afford to pay at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cost it would be largely a non-issue, since it would allow the producers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to stay competitive with people re-selling their product.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Let me explain it again:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If producers give away excess capacity below cost, it lowers the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;margin on the grain that they do sell for a profit, sometimes forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them out of the market.  The short-term effect may be beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(recovering expenses), but the glut of too cheap grain creates a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;negative long-term effect on overall production because it decreases the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effective market size from a producers standpoint.  If the world worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your way, the producers would quickly sink into unprofitability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would shut down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So its just like OPEC.  They are destroying produce to artificially inflate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the price.  Perhaps this indicates that there are too many grain producers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that society (and the grain market) would be better off if some of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *did* shut down?  I realize that probably wouldn't go over too well for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those producers that had to do the shutting down.  But in general might it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be better than the collosal waste that current practice creates?
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing is, Zero, that in an economy the size of ours (which a single
<BR>
person cannot totally appreciate), a few million pounds of grain is the
<BR>
sort of waste you will get merely because the system that is already in
<BR>
place to discourage farmers from planting too much might be off on its
<BR>
estimates by a fraction of a percent, or if the estimated rainfall is
<BR>
off by a few percent.
<BR>
<P>A good comparison is to compare the grain production of the US with the
<BR>
wood consumption of building a house. Most contractors and architects
<BR>
will budget in at least 10-20% overage for wood that is waste cuttings:
<BR>
its those ends of short wood that are useless, or wood that arrives with
<BR>
splits, knots, warps, theft, etc..  Using the current wastage of the US
<BR>
grain market, which deals with forces of nature that are far harder to
<BR>
estimate for and control than a supply of well cut wood, the contractors
<BR>
would have to improve their efficiency by a factor of two to four to be
<BR>
as good and efficient with their wood.
