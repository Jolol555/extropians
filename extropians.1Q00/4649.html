<EM>&gt; &gt; The only way to fight that fight is with money. Assuming you have gobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and gobs of it, you start your own domain name registration service, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get ICANN, or WIPO or whoever it is now that oversees and approves new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; domain name registry services to let you get into the business. Possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; create your own new top level domains (rather than .com .net .web, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use .sys, .inc, .corp, .home, etc....) Once you have done this, sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope, no reason really to try to go through ICANN. No laws preventing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you from setting up your own registry right now. The trick is getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people's operating systems to utilize your registry. The DNS resolvers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of existing OSs can be setup to check whatever root servers you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like for a resolution, so it is not technically difficult to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to use your service. You just have to somehow convince everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to setup their computers to do it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be nice to have some kind of system whereby DNS servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could automatically be notified of new registries, sort of like how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newsgroups are created. The server admin can setup the dns server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to automatically add these new registries, or he can manually ok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them all. I really don't see a reason why not to do this. What is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the logic ICANN is using to not allow as many TLDs as people would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like?
</EM><BR>
<P>The logic is that the entire namespace belongs to the human race, and
<BR>
that that real estate needs to be preserved for the common benefit of
<BR>
all. Pure socialist hogwash, of course, but ICANN is now a major NGO
<BR>
with the UN. I can just imagine them sending UN Peacekeepers to occupy
<BR>
your offices....maybe they'll just call you domestic terrorists and send
<BR>
the new military Gestapo after you. Your argument has merit, possibly
<BR>
you could start the process, then as you run into snags with acceptance,
<BR>
and possibly outright interference from ICAN, you could bring anti-trust
<BR>
action against ICANN.
