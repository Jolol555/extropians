U.S. Scientists Closer to Making Supercomputer
<BR>
By Bill Rosato
<BR>
<P>LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. scientists Wednesday moved a step closer to 
<BR>
developing a super-computer after looking at a branch of physics which 
<BR>
researches the physics of particles invisible to the human eye.
<BR>
<P>``In the language of quantum information science, we have realized a 
<BR>
four-quantum-bit logic gate. This system is relevant for the future 
<BR>
development of quantum information technology,'' the scientists said in the 
<BR>
journal Nature.
<BR>
<P>Conventional computers are based on binary ``switches,'' or bits, which can 
<BR>
either be switched on or off and computers carry out calculations utilizing 
<BR>
these switches.
<BR>
<P>Quantum theory holds that entities such as atoms do not decide whether they 
<BR>
exist in an on or off state until they are measured or interact with 
<BR>
something.
<BR>
<P>When they are not interacting the atoms exist in both states at once -- a 
<BR>
quantum superposition -- said Christopher Monroe, a researcher at the 
<BR>
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
<BR>
<P>Computers based on quantum physics would therefore be able to have switches 
<BR>
or ``qbits,'' which exist in both on and off states simultaneously.
<BR>
<P>A string of these quantum bits would consequently offer every possible on-off 
<BR>
combination and could carry out every calculation a computer needed 
<BR>
simultaneously, hugely increasing the computer's power and memory.
<BR>
<P>But maintaining several superpositions -- an entanglement -- is difficult. So 
<BR>
far it had only been maintained in systems of two or three qbits until US 
<BR>
researchers at NIST entangled four quantum particles, Rainer Blatt of the 
<BR>
University of Innsbruck said in an article in the journal nature.
<BR>
<P>Although many more particles would have to be ``entangled'' in order for a 
<BR>
quantum computer to become a reality the researchers were confident that the 
<BR>
technique could be used to create larger entanglements.
<BR>
<P>``Our technique is scalable to a lot more atoms. If we get to that level, 
<BR>
we'll not only bring the strangest feature of quantum mechanics closer to the 
<BR>
macroscopic world (the world visible to the naked eye), but we may also have 
<BR>
a quantum computer,'' Monroe said in a statement.
<BR>
<P>The new U.S. technique allows many-particle entanglement with ``comparatively 
<BR>
little effort'' and will be invaluable to further quantum state engineering, 
<BR>
Blatt said.
