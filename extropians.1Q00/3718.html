<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; To denigrate the weakening of the definition of intelligence &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You keep saying 'including abilities denigrates, or weakens intelligence'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Explain how this happens. I see no reason that adding other abilities to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intelligence somehow magically waters mathematical / verbal abstract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;symbolic reasoning down.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not say that it weakens intelligence, I said it weakens the
<BR>
*definition* of intelligence. They are, I assure you, two very different
<BR>
things. The map is not the territory, and all that...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It doesn't makes that behavior less valuable, inherently,it just raises
</EM><BR>
other &gt;behaviors up. That's like saying if other people get taller, you'll
<BR>
be &gt;shorter.
<BR>
<P>Intelligence, and those other abilities, are of the same fundamental kind.
<BR>
None of them are, prima facie, more important then any of the others.
<BR>
Intelligence is not &quot;higher&quot; then the others, nor has it ever been.
<BR>
Accordingly, you cannot &quot;raise&quot; abilities to the level of intelligence,
<BR>
anymore then you can raise oranges to the level of apples. They are all
<BR>
fruit. Intelligence is an ability. As is musical ability, or verbal ability.
<BR>
You COULD refer to apples as &quot;red oranges&quot;, but you'd sound silly.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Raising&quot; cognitive abilities, relative to each other, is as ludicrous as
<BR>
&quot;lowering them&quot;. They are all the same.
<BR>
<P>Apples are apples, oranges are oranges, and they are both fruit.
<BR>
<P>Intelligence is mathematical/verbal abstract symbolic reasoning ability, and
<BR>
musical intelligence is musical ability. They are both cognitive abilities.
<BR>
<P>I don't see how I can be any more clear. What I am against is the purposeful
<BR>
mangling of a word with a perfectly clear definition (&quot;intelligence&quot;), in
<BR>
order to refer to objects for which there is ALREADY a perfectly clear word
<BR>
(&quot;cognitive ability&quot;.) All I am against is the creating of meaingless jargon
<BR>
for the sole puropse of creating controversy. (&quot;Ooh, look! This
<BR>
psychologist's book has completely re-defined human cognition. Let's buy
<BR>
it!&quot;). I've noticed this occurrs in pop-psychology all too often. A
<BR>
perfectly straightforward word is redefined in a tortured, illogical, and
<BR>
not particularly useful way in order to generate enough cognitive dissonance
<BR>
in the potential reader to induce them to purchase the book.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Two, you also assert &quot;the universal all-importance of symbolic reasoning&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I just reread my email, and I'm genuinely puzzled as to how you extracted
<BR>
this from my message. I am not asserting ANY such &quot;universal importance&quot;, I
<BR>
am *referring* to it, as a belief other people seem to have held. I disagree
<BR>
with this assertion. I commented at length in my email on my disagreement
<BR>
with this assertion. I commented that, in disagreeing with this assertion, I
<BR>
found myself in agreement with Binet, QueenMUSE, Gardner, and you.
<BR>
Quotations, traditionally, allow one to refer to an assertion without
<BR>
implying one's agreement to it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the other hand, explain why empiricism would be less ridiculous a
</EM><BR>
notion
<BR>
<EM>&gt;in a notoriously soft science such as behavioral development, or psychology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in general?  Finally at this point in history, perhaps empirical evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;begins to dribble in about the brain's workings, but for now it isn't yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time to claim we have empirical knowledge of the mind, yet. Soon ...
</EM><BR>
soon...
<BR>
<P><P>Ignorance of the facts is never an excuse for unbridled speculation, except
<BR>
as fiction, clearly marked as such. (Dental history would be 2000 years
<BR>
ahead if Aristotle could have been bothered to count his wife's teeth :))
<BR>
(YES, that was facetious.)) Freud had that excuse. Binet may have had that
<BR>
excuse. Gardner is a contemporary to MRI scanners, and functional cognitive
<BR>
science, and working theories of vision rigourous enough that they actually
<BR>
work when you tell a computer to emulate them, AND is working in the
<BR>
post-Piaget era. He doesn't have that excuse.
