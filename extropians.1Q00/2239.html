<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am concerned about synaptic structure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, if you think about it, there may be very little extracellular
<BR>
material holding synapses together, unlike say an extracellular matrix
<BR>
in many other tissue types.  This is probably due to the fact that
<BR>
the neurotransmitters have to diffuse across these regions.  Taking
<BR>
a look at The Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 19, synapses
<BR>
seem to have a size of 0.5-1.0 micrometer (so these are roughly
<BR>
the size of nanobots, which is pretty big).  This makes sense because
<BR>
the axon terminals have to contain mitochondria to generate energy
<BR>
to drive neurotranmitter manufacture and recycling.  MBotC also notes
<BR>
that synapses have &quot;thickened&quot; postsynaptic and to a lesser extent
<BR>
presynaptic membranes.  The presynaptic membranes have behind
<BR>
them large numbers of neurotransmitter vesicles, while the post-synaptic
<BR>
membranes presumably have large numbers of neurotransmitter gated
<BR>
ion channels in them.  So recognition of the synapses should be
<BR>
straight forward.  Then the question comes down to what keeps this
<BR>
structure in place.  That would seem to fall on the shoulders of the
<BR>
microtubules and intermediate filaments within the axon itself.
<BR>
Tracing the paths and lengths of these filaments would seem to
<BR>
dictate exactly where an axon should end up in 3D space.  The
<BR>
pattern of these filaments within the axon has to be fairly
<BR>
unique and so even if an axon is severed entirely, you should
<BR>
be able to find its opposite face with the nearby material
<BR>
simply by matching filament patterns.
<BR>
<P>If there is some extracellular matrix surrounding a synapse
<BR>
(perhaps useful for keeping the neurotransmitters from diffusing
<BR>
too much) then that provides an additional set of mirror images that
<BR>
you can use to match up surfaces.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know how rigidly the synapse is held together, but I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a growing ice crystal could separate, perforate and even shred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the membranes.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was my point, that crystals would presumably disrupt hydrogen
<BR>
bonds (dictating hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions) before they
<BR>
actually &quot;broke&quot; proteins.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would suspect that cell membranes are not strong enough to withstand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ice crystal penetration.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but membranes are self-healing if you put them in relative
<BR>
proximity to each other.  There are many experiments documenting
<BR>
the movement of proteins in membrane surfaces unless they are fixed
<BR>
to the internal filaments in some way.  For cryonics recovery you
<BR>
would have to have a large number of &quot;membrane-healing&quot; nanobots
<BR>
that &quot;covered&quot; fractured membrane surfaces and patched or healed them.
<BR>
Robert has a precedent for this in his &quot;endotheliocytes&quot; that collectively
<BR>
do &quot;plaque&quot; dissection and repair in blood vessels.
<BR>
<P>Now, interestingly enough, since you are interested in keeping
<BR>
as much of the external structure intact as possible, it might
<BR>
make sense for the nanobots to operate from within the neurons.
<BR>
Get into a neuron, remove the ice crystals and filaments as
<BR>
necessary (tracking molecule counts and locations), when you
<BR>
find some damaged membranes attach &quot;bungy&quot; proteins with
<BR>
grappling hooks to the severed surfaces, so when you warm things up
<BR>
they get drawn back together.  Then back your way out, reinstalling
<BR>
any removed molecules as necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have the impression that synapses are relatively gently bound together.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm unsure, perhaps Anders knows.  We could probably make some estimates
<BR>
on this based on some research into the force required to cause
<BR>
a concussion or permanent brain damage (say for professional fighters).
<BR>
Then the question is whether growing ice crystals have this much
<BR>
&quot;force&quot; or whether they are going to always grow along the path
<BR>
of least resistance.  It sould seem to me they should only grow
<BR>
on surfaces where water is available.  Once they grow to
<BR>
a membrane, they should stop growing.  Only growth on the
<BR>
opposing face striking a similarly hard surface would seem to
<BR>
be able to generate the force required to puncture membranes.
<BR>
<P>I think this is something that could use some molecular modeling.
<BR>
<P>But if you think about it, if you got too much membrane puncture
<BR>
then when you thaw a steak or a fish you should get some kind
<BR>
of icy steak/fish puree, not something by and large that looks like
<BR>
the steak or fish that you froze.  And food freezing is certainly a more
<BR>
severe process than cryonic suspension.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem is that the shapes may not match very well once the ice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is removed.  As the ice is forming, the material around it is at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a semi liquid.  Water flows out of the cells and they would partially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collapse due to dehydration.  The cells themselves would be shoved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around by the ice, tugged and torn, and their shapes will change.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but I don't think the shapes would change very much at
<BR>
low temperatures.  To lose the original structural pattern,
<BR>
you would have to disassemble filaments, mitochondria, etc. and
<BR>
those require chemical reactions that most likely cannot occur
<BR>
(or at least don't occur rapidly on the scale of freeze-down time).
<BR>
We know that because we can take the brain down to near-zero
<BR>
and recover it.  Now the deydration aspect is simply like that
<BR>
of letting the air out of a oddly shaped balloon.  When you
<BR>
put the air back in, it returns to its original shape because
<BR>
that is what is required by the surface areas.  I think so
<BR>
long as you heal the membrane surface, this should happen with
<BR>
neurons as well, especially because of the internal skeleton.
