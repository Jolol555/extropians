<P><EM>&gt;but apparently it needs saying some more: despotism and  totalitarianism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thrive on secrecy.  Ubiquitous two-way power proportional transparency does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*away* with secrecy and, at the same time, with despotism.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Conrad's position of note, however, when I met him, was on the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;topic.  He pointed out around '79 that the only survivable high-tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;civilization would be one with universal surveillance.  Consider that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;price for total species annihilation has been and will continue to decline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exponentially for the forseeable future.  No centralized Big Brother can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handle this problem in the long term, as - to put it very briefly - &quot;who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guards the guards.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Only a competitive system, probably run by the insurance companies looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for risk violations, could possibly have a reasonable chance for longterm -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i.e., staying ahead of the risk curve for the life of the universe - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in preventing species destruction.  That, as I understood it, was Conrad's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position in a nutshell.
</EM><BR>
<P>*Precisely* my point.  I didn't come to my conclusions regarding 
<BR>
transparency because I'm a nosy busy body.  I came to them because I want to 
<BR>
see a world where humanity, in its entirety, is permitted to take advantage 
<BR>
of the huge freedoms and powers that will be bestowed on us by such things 
<BR>
as AI and nanotech.  However the obvious fact is that if I had a 
<BR>
nano-assembly device, I could make just about anything.  Therefore I would 
<BR>
be a *HUGE* threat to your existence.
<BR>
<P>So I started thinking...how can we distribute such technology to the masses 
<BR>
and at the same time assure ourselves that some crank won't sterilize the 
<BR>
planet?  I read Drexler's thoughts about active shields and restricting 
<BR>
access to the really dangerous information and such.  But I came to the 
<BR>
conclusion the active shield system would have to be almost perfectly 
<BR>
fool-proof every step of the way.  From design to contruction to 
<BR>
distribution to implementation.  Moreover it would have to be quite 
<BR>
verifiable in order for anyone with any sense to put any trust in it.  
<BR>
Verifiablility = transparency.  But how can you keep this really dangerous 
<BR>
information restricted and transparent at the same time?
<BR>
<P>Which brought me to the idea of trying to keep information restricted.  Can 
<BR>
it be done?  Sure, information can be restricted to certain people.  Can it 
<BR>
be *flawlessly* done?  No.  There is hardly a secret that has not been told 
<BR>
to someone who wasn't intended to have it.  And on the net, once *anybody* 
<BR>
has the secret, *everybody* has it.  Basically, it comes down to entrusting 
<BR>
some human to safeguard the secret and your safety.  Who on Earth is that 
<BR>
trustworthy?
<BR>
<P>Which led me to believe that maybe Bill Joy is right.  Maybe we shouldn't 
<BR>
persue such powerful tech.  Because for me its an all or nothing 
<BR>
proposition.  Either everybody gets to use it, or no one does.  If you're 
<BR>
scared of Big Brother now, just wait till he gets nanosized cameras and 
<BR>
nanosized assasination bots.
<BR>
<P>But, the obvious response to Bill Joy's &quot;Hey lets stop all progress in these 
<BR>
areas&quot; is that relinquishment will not happen.  If progress doesn't proceed 
<BR>
in the open, it will certainly proceed in secret, and then we're *really* in 
<BR>
trouble.  No, the progress will proceed and it *must* proceed in the open.  
<BR>
So what to do?
<BR>
<P>The only answer I can come up with that makes sense is quid pro quo.  To get 
<BR>
a little, you have to give a little.  You want superhuman powers?  Then you 
<BR>
have to subject your self to superhuman surveillance so we can keep an eye 
<BR>
on you to make sure you don't destroy the solar system.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you are Lorreyesque in your surveillance-phobia, fine.  No 
<BR>
surveillance for you.  But that also means you get no nano-assembly devices 
<BR>
or use of strong AI.  You want to keep *everything* about yourself a secret? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine.  Here's what you do:  You get yourself a cabin in the Montana 
<BR>
wilderness and fill it with lots of interesting books and *stay* there.  
<BR>
Because the minute you come out and interact with anyone (computer or 
<BR>
person) in anyway, it will be recorded.
<BR>
<P>So I said to myself:  &quot;Self, if that were the case, if you had to choose 
<BR>
between lonely, boring hermithood (albeit with all the privacy I could 
<BR>
stand) and being able to take full advantage of the benefits of 
<BR>
transhumanity (albeit under a microscope), which would you choose?&quot;
<BR>
<P>As I see it, in the long run as our tech gets scarier and scarier, those are 
<BR>
the only two choices.  If there are other choices, if there are practical 
<BR>
compromises between these two extremes, I'm open for them.  But, as of now, 
<BR>
I simply don't see them.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
