(snip several lovely scenes)
<BR>
&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;These ideas are all pretty &quot;primitive&quot; and anthropomorphic compared to the 
<BR>
&nbsp;kinds of abstract experiences an upload with SI capabilities might think up 
<BR>
&nbsp;to have.  But, since I'm not an SI, it's hard for me to imagine what kinds 
<BR>
of 
<BR>
&nbsp;pleasures I might invent with those capabilities . . . .

<P>Thanks Greg, that was very descriptive! I do not make apologies for being 
<BR>
anthropomorphic about my desired scenarios. Pleasure and pure love is my 
<BR>
goal. 
<BR>
<P>I am also into learning, so I can get busy designing all sorts of things. I 
<BR>
love yoru idea about remotes, because it involves contact with the *real* 
<BR>
world, and still marveling in it's wonders!
<BR>
<P>I see transhumanists as divided into the following camps:
<BR>
<P>Those who love this human life on earth, as it is, find it sweet and 
<BR>
poignant.  They desire to continue forever, elongating one's pleasure, 
<BR>
improving on an already wonderful experience by fine-tuning the body and 
<BR>
mind, or moving it forward into new territories. 
<BR>
<P>Those who have a distaste for human life on earth, as it is, and think we 
<BR>
must improve it, and/or wish to move on to the next phase of evolutionary 
<BR>
development as soon as possible since the weaknesses and frailties of our 
<BR>
current state is almost intolerable.
<BR>
<P>Some people fall into a halfway mark, or both.
