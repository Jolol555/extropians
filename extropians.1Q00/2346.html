<EM>&gt;&gt; Wandering the web I found the following.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; It relates to an earlier discussion on this list regarding Velikovsky.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; find it interesting that BBC would be so brazen as to publish such a thing!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Get out the pitchforks and torches!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually, this seems to be in line with what I've followed in the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technical (but still popular) astronomy press... planetary orbits in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intense interactions in a the early solar system were very unstable.  IIRC,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the biggest planet tends to move inward as it tends to eject objects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lie inward from it, but I'm not sure I recall the disequilibrium condition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that causes this.  The presence of &quot;hot jovians&quot; in other solar systems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circling their stars in only days in orbits far smaller than Mercury's,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shows that planatary evolution can be quite, er, dynamic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Some of the theories for the &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;
<BR>
<P>(I personally like the name &quot;Roasters&quot; better...)  are
<BR>
<P><P>The forming planetesimal is caught between adjacent parcels of
<BR>
gas moving at different speeds within the accretion disk, and the
<BR>
planetesimal gets dragged along with it, inward. (Lin et al's theory)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR
<BR>
<P>A planetesimal which forms in the outer portion of an accretion disk
<BR>
by angular momentum exchange loses energy and sprials inward, but then the
<BR>
magnetic field associated with the star sweeps up the gas in
<BR>
the accretion disk, expels it, carves out a hole, and the planetsimal
<BR>
is caught in the hole
<BR>
(Marcy et al's theory, I think).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR
<BR>
<P><P>Long after the gas in the accretion disk has dispersed and planetisimals
<BR>
are orbiting in the debris in the outer region of thet system, gravity of
<BR>
the outer planets disturbs the orbits of the planetesimals in their
<BR>
vicinity sending some of the debris inwards towards. That debris is now in
<BR>
the
<BR>
vicinity of planets orbiting nearer the (proto)star. Those close planet(s)
<BR>
hurl some of the material by gravity, and some of it outward. Whenever
<BR>
those inner planet(s) toss the material outwards, the planet loses a little
<BR>
bit of energy, and moves inward slightly (Malhotra and Norman's theory).
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>Interaction betwen giant planets in the outer part of a planetary system
<BR>

<BR>
happens a &quot;slingshot effect&quot; between the star and the planets throws
<BR>
one of the planets out of the system and the other planet loses energy
<BR>
and moves inward.

<P><P>Too many for me to keep track of!
<BR>
<P>I have not been following closely enough these various theories to
<BR>
know which are in &quot;favor&quot; and which have been ruled out. However
<BR>
it's true that the extrasolar planets discoveries have totally
<BR>
revitalized the planet-formation theory business. Every planetary
<BR>
science meeting I'm at, I see new sessions devoted to the topic.
<BR>
<P>The work that EvMick pointed to is _yet another theory_ for planet
<BR>
formation.
<BR>
<P>I didn't read the journal article, but I note that it is the same
<BR>
work as Levison, Duncan et al, presented at the Division of
<BR>
Planetary Sciences meeting last October in Italy:
<BR>
<P>-----------------
<BR>
<P>[33.09] Uranus and Neptune: Refugees from the Jupiter-Saturn zone?
<BR>
<P>E. W. Thommes, M. J. Duncan (Queen's University, Kingston, ON), H.
<BR>
F. Levison (SwRI, Boulder, CO)
<BR>
<P>Plantesimal accretion models of planet formation have been quite
<BR>
successful at reproducing the terrestrial region of the Solar
<BR>
System. However, in the outer Solar System these models run into
<BR>
problems, and it becomes very difficult to grow bodies to the
<BR>
current mass of the ``ice giants,&quot; Uranus and Neptune. Here we
<BR>
present an alternative scenario to in-situ formation of the ice
<BR>
giants. In addition to the Jupiter and Saturn solid cores, several
<BR>
more bodies of mass ~10 MEarth or more are likely to have formed in
<BR>
the region between 4 and 10 AU. As Jupiter's core, and perhaps
<BR>
Saturn's, accreted nebular gas, the other nearby bodies must have
<BR>
been scattered outward. Dynamical friction with the trans-Saturnian
<BR>
part of the planetesimal disk would have acted to decouple these
<BR>
``failed cores&quot; from their scatterer, and to circularize their
<BR>
orbits. Numerical simulations presented here show that systems very
<BR>
similar to our outer Solar System (including Uranus, Neptune, the
<BR>
Kuiper belt, and the scattered disk) are a natural product of this
<BR>
process.
<BR>
<P>-----------------
<BR>
<P><P>Martin Duncan and Hal Levison also coauthored a related talk at the
<BR>
meeting:
<BR>
<P><P>-----------------
<BR>
<P>[6.05] The Formation of the Oort Cloud
<BR>
<P>H. Levison, L. Dones (SwRI), M. Duncan (Queen's U.), P. Weissman
<BR>
(JPL)
<BR>
<P>We are in the process of completing a detailed model of the
<BR>
formation of the Oort cloud. We integrated the orbits of ~1800 test
<BR>
particles, initially in low-inclination, nearly-circular orbits
<BR>
between the giant planets for times up to four billion years. This
<BR>
simulation included the gravitational effects of the Sun, four giant
<BR>
planets (in their current configuration), galactic tides, and
<BR>
passing stars. The trajectory of a particle was followed until it
<BR>
was ejected from the solar system, or impacted the Sun or a planet.
<BR>
We find that all regions of the proto-planetary disk contribute to
<BR>
the Oort cloud. The Oort cloud was built in two distinct stages in
<BR>
our models. In the first 5 \times 107 years, the Oort cloud was
<BR>
built by Jupiter and Saturn. These planets delivered particles
<BR>
initially from all regions of the proto-planetary disk directly to
<BR>
semi-major axes between 10,000 and 100,000 AU. After this time, the
<BR>
Oort cloud was built mainly by Neptune. Objects that entered the
<BR>
Oort cloud during this time also came from all regions of the
<BR>
proto-planetary disk, but spent some time in the scattered disk.
<BR>
<P>-----------------
<BR>
<P><P>To help counter the idea that EvMick's BBC article is like a Velikovsky
<BR>
strange theory, I will say that I've known previous work from these
<BR>
people for at least 15 years, they are very reputable and some of the
<BR>
smartest folks in the planet formation theory field. (They are not
<BR>
quacks, in other words)
<BR>
<P><P>Some of you might enjoy browsing through the abstracts of the last
<BR>
DPS meeting, in order to get a flavor for what people of working
<BR>
on for planet formation.
