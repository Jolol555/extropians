<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Is there any actual historical evidence that JC even existed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; EvMick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Holbrook Az....(in a snowstorm)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The most obvious, or famous, evidence is the New Testament, totally apart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from whether one considers the New Testament to have any religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  validity. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't consider it to be just a tiny bit biased?
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Some (most?) of the books of the New Testament were allegedly
<BR>
<P>Allegedly.....key word here...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  written by Apostles of Christ who knew him personally during his life,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and were written down in contemporary Greek within a couple of hundred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  years of the lifetime of Jesus,
</EM><BR>
<P>not exactly an eyewitness account....&quot;he said that he said that she said that 
<BR>
he said.....for a couple of hundred years?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;with, I think, a fairly good 'chain of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  custody' of copies and translations down to our time, including some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  extant manuscripts which can be dated to very early times. 
</EM><BR>
<P>relegious manuscripts...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Christianity's two 'sister' religions, Judaism and Islam, both recognize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Jesus as a religiously significant figure, and therefore presumably also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as historical fact.  The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (religious teacher), and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prophets who came before Mohammed, the Seal of the Prophets (the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prophet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>you missed my point is suppose...  Is there any independent historical 
<BR>
evidence that JC existed?   Is his existence mentioned by contemporary Roman 
<BR>
historians for example?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Dozens, if not hundreds, of towns and other sites mentioned in the New
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Testament are identifiable today, some with a high degree of confidence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with ruins and physical features which can be directly verified in person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  by a modern visitor.  Numerous artifacts of various types, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pottery and hundreds of thousands if not millions of coins from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  general era of Jesus still exist and provide abundant evidence of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  historical context in which rulers or governors held power in particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  regions at particular times surrounding the places and times associated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with Jesus.  
</EM><BR>
<P>And your point is?   UFO sitings routinely identify local towns?  So?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A much more recent figure, William Shakespeare, is the subject of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  controversy as to whether he actually wrote the famous plays of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1500s, despite the fact that he allegedly lived in a time when literacy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  was not uncommon, and he allegedly wrote and produced plays which were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  performed very publicly in London, the world's leading metropolis at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  time, and everyone there spoke English, not much different from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  English of today.  The plays were, I think, advertised with mass-produced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  printed handbills.  Like Jesus, Shakespeare became more famous after his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  time than during his time, and like Jesus, it seems that there will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  always be some who cannot be convinced of the historical validity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Shakespeare, just as there will always be some who doubt that men walked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  on the Moon in 1969.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>ok...so Will was (or was not) bogus...what's that got to do with JC?  or the 
<BR>
moon landing......
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Which of the following legendary figures actually existed: Davey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Crockett, Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
Or the mighty hulk......or the Thing....or the creature from the black 
<BR>
lagoon.....sheesh.....there are greek &quot;logic terms&quot; for this.....&quot;ergo 
<BR>
hoc....etc..&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>muttering &lt;ask a simple question.............&gt;
<BR>
