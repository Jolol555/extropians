<P><P>For all effective reasons, I am the child of the 90's.
<BR>
Could you elaborate on those?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It makes sense only if you can profit from media attention.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, some groups will profit from that, let them run it.
<BR>
I thought I'd just inspire somebody.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now everbody's ravin' -- Rave on!
</EM><BR>
<P>You have any statistics?  Raves are fun, except that there
<BR>
are mostly young kids there.  I love their company, but could
<BR>
use more; besides, playing with kids at times brings too much
<BR>
trouble, especially with the conservative parents and authorities,
<BR>
and the presence of the repressive government spoils much of the fun.
<BR>
<P>There are so many conservative groups around who impose their
<BR>
idiotic rules that they consider natural but they are so
<BR>
illogical that one can't even guess what may upset them. 
<BR>
<P>And they want to hurt you for any sign of deviation from their
<BR>
picked-out-of-the-ass behavioral norms.
<BR>
<P>Big and increasing annoyance in my life recently, as I am getting
<BR>
personally more and more liberated, while in the eyes of the
<BR>
aging mundane &quot;peers&quot; I should be behaving more and more like
<BR>
a stable middle-aged professional, with respect to religious
<BR>
values, authorities, mundane life experiences, etc.
<BR>
<P>Can't live with mundanes, can't help them (you help one to
<BR>
become half-free, the others want to kill you, you help another
<BR>
in something else - the first one joins the persecution), can't
<BR>
kill them, can't escape from them.
<BR>
<P>Any options that I missed?
