<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I was in Basic Training (Army), it was common for obese individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lose 40 pounds in 8 weeks and you couldn't help but to gain lean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; muscle mass.  I went in at 150-lbs and came out at 135-lbs despite gaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some lean mass, and I wasn't obese by any means.  My body fat was easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;10% by the time I left.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All it took was heavy exercise every day and a regulated diet (Army food,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while mediocre in flavor and texture, *is* designed to be quite healthy).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The results are a lot more lasting too, because it tends to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; habitual behavior modification.  The point being that it is a lifestyle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change, not a &quot;something I do for two hours on four days a week&quot;, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why yuppie DIs are probably a waste of money.
</EM><BR>
<P>After diabetics, whose body no longer produce insulin, the people who lose
<BR>
weight the easiest are teenage men.  Exercise does not work nearly as well in
<BR>
women who don't have much testosterone, and as a consequence, have difficulty
<BR>
putting on muscle mass. Also, I believe the army feeds its people properly,
<BR>
instead of following the low fat/low calorie fad.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the situation is different for older people.  Testosterone
<BR>
levels decline, thyroid levels decline, and insulin resistance has set in.
<BR>
Losing weight becomes much more difficult.  It is a very serious problem.
