This is a solicted draft article for an audience of non-transhuman futurists.
<BR>
Comments wuold be appreciatd.
<BR>
<P>=====================
<BR>
Scenario of 3000 C.E.-
<BR>
<P>DECLINE AND FALL OF NATIONS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium started off with quite a bang, or rather, an implosion. The
<BR>
Last Bubble and its global fiat-currency collapse of 2000-2001 C.E. led 
<BR>
into the
<BR>
two-decade Really Great Depression. Mankind's final experiment with fraudulent
<BR>
money and all its attendant horrors gave rise to the current system of Open
<BR>
Currency- money creation visible and monitored by all. That single advance
<BR>
produced all manner of benefits- freeing us from the machinations of parasitic
<BR>
financiers, damping boom-bust cycles, and destroying the then popular
<BR>
debt-welfare state.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although entities resembling nation-states lingered on for another fifty 
<BR>
years
<BR>
or so, they were never quite the same. The global interconnectivity of 
<BR>
minds was
<BR>
well under way: the notion of a free press was re-introduced, net-based
<BR>
correlators tracked the activities of the powerful, virtual courts tried them
<BR>
with juries ranging into the millions; the emperor's clothes were found 
<BR>
wanting.
<BR>
Civilization's childhood of hierarchical command was over.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Revolution had reached its natural conclusion by 2060 
<BR>
C.E. with
<BR>
the advent of atomic-scale engineering and the ability to replicate the 
<BR>
means of
<BR>
production itself. This of course did not affect the fundamental underpinnings
<BR>
of economics.
<BR>
<P>There was one small SETI event of note-
<BR>
In 2538 C.E. a brief set of radio messages emanating from a star in the
<BR>
Andromeda Galaxy was intercepted and partially decoded. One of the signals 
<BR>
was a
<BR>
video broadcast, depicting an alien race having large bony structures on their
<BR>
heads, hence the term &quot;Bonehead&quot;. Parts of  messages were translated as 
<BR>
&quot;…by the
<BR>
God-given wisdom of our Bonehead Overlords…&quot; and &quot;…we'll just print up some 
<BR>
more
<BR>
United Bonehead currency for that…&quot; and &quot;...all for one and one for all…&quot;.
<BR>
After a short staccato of high-energy electromagnetic pulses they were not 
<BR>
heard
<BR>
from anymore.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Old Continents of an increasingly irrelevant Earth have been
<BR>
restored to a semblance of their pre-industrial state, more a matter of whimsy
<BR>
than anything else. I/we seldom walk there anymore as biological humans- there
<BR>
is little to gain from it. The real action in directed evolution is on the Dark
<BR>
Stars. Our augmented bird, reptile, 'dinosaur' and mammal superintelligences
<BR>
have added some richness to the original great ape derived lines.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side note, I/we have decided to disassemble Venus- trying to cool 
<BR>
it down
<BR>
as a single mass is too much of a hassle. We'll have to adjust Earth's orbit a
<BR>
trifle in the process. We move out to the stars, our Sphere of Life is now over
<BR>
700 light-years radius. The unfettered hyper-evolution in the new systems adds
<BR>
yet more richness and diversity.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pathology of religious belief finally faded into welcome oblivion after
<BR>
the derivation of the Godel-Invert Proof in 2130-2138 C.E. With this full
<BR>
realization, that I/we are alone and on our own in the here and now, the
<BR>
preservation and extension of superintelligent consciousness becomes
<BR>
immeasurably more imperative.
