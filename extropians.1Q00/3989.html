<EM>&gt; To be more precise, such a science might predict your beliefs at any stage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a cognitive process; I see no reason to focus on some mythical &quot;end.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>If I'm understanding this argument, it seems a little too powerful.
<BR>
It is not only arguing that ethics can be understood by empirical means,
<BR>
it is saying that ethics is a branch of cognitive science, because
<BR>
by cognitive analysis we can predict everything a person will come to
<BR>
believe about ethics, and that is, from his perspective, all that he
<BR>
can ever know about ethics.
<BR>
<P>If this is the argument, it seems to apply to all sciences.  Physics is a
<BR>
branch of cognitive science because we can in principle predict everything
<BR>
someone will ever know about physics.
<BR>
<P>A couple of problems I can see with this are, first, that there is a
<BR>
philosophical difference between physics as a science and the part of
<BR>
physics I will learn.  It may be that I am doomed never to understand
<BR>
very much of physics, but that doesn't mean that the subject shares the
<BR>
same limitations.
<BR>
<P>Second, for cognitive science to make such predictions it must have
<BR>
access to all the empirical knowledge I will ever acquire.  Without a
<BR>
complete model of the universe, neither cognitive science nor any other
<BR>
branch of science can make this kind of prediction.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I have missed the point of Robin's argument though?
