Friends,
<BR>
<P>On Mon, 20 Mar 2000 17:27:04 -0800
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20nanodebugging&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000322220357.007c3bf0@coastside.net&gt;">hal@finney.org</A> responded to Eliezer as follows:
<BR>
<P>Eliezer:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; There's no way - that I know of, anyway, correct me if I'm wrong - to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; read out the atomic positions inside a complex molecular structure. &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hal:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;At the time of assembly it is much easier to check for errors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Repeated insertion and verification steps can reduce the error to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very low level.  It is true that after assembly is complete, internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spontaneous or radiation generated errors may be difficult to detect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nevertheless functional tests of the entire unit can be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characterize and detect many failure modes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, er, well, that is, I think there is a way &quot;to read out the atomic
<BR>
positions inside a complex molecular structure.&quot;  In fact, a multitude of
<BR>
ways.
<BR>
<P>I would like to suggest that the above quotes seem to reflect a somewhat
<BR>
impoverished view of the likely characteristics of the operational regimen
<BR>
of a mature nanotechnology.  Inspection will, more logically, be entirely
<BR>
routine, and VERY easy.  Inspection and testing is at the heart of any
<BR>
technology.  Quality control is fundamental, and an essential part of
<BR>
establishing reliable functionality. Technology without measurement and
<BR>
inspection and testing, is a contradiction in terms.  It is blind and
<BR>
ignorant.  It lacks the INFORMATION about the state of the system that is
<BR>
inferred by the very term &quot;design&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There will be a whole array of methods to test for damaged nanocomponents,
<BR>
and to obtain PERFECTLY precise information about the structural details in
<BR>
question.  For instance, from what I know of chemical analysis, various
<BR>
spectroscopic techniques currently in use involve EM irradiation of a
<BR>
specimen, and the determination of the structure of the various molecules
<BR>
by comparison with known spectral characteristics.  There's absorbtion,
<BR>
emission, and NMR spectroscopy to name a few.   (In contrast to the testing
<BR>
of a solitary nanobot, these spectral analyses are conducted on mixtures of
<BR>
vast billions upon billions of molecules, which even at the highest purity
<BR>
still have substantial levels of impurities.  Thus, though the analytical
<BR>
techniques give perfectly usable informational results, the spectra
<BR>
reflect, in their fuzziness, the bulk nature of the samples being
<BR>
analyzed.)  Why should these standard techniques not apply to inspecting
<BR>
nanobots?  In fact, why should they not work even more definitively and
<BR>
precisely, being applied as they inevitably would be, to a single isolated
<BR>
bot unit?  
<BR>
<P>A perfect nanobot has every atom in its proper place.  Such a bot will
<BR>
absorb EM energy, and vibrate in a very precise manner.  It should have
<BR>
spectral characteristics that  PRECISELY reflect its structural
<BR>
particulars.  If even one atom is out of place, it will vibrate
<BR>
differently, absorb differently, emit differently, across an entire
<BR>
spectrum.   Thus an inspection procedure carried out by an inspection bot
<BR>
should be able to tell you if it's subject bot is perfect or not, and if
<BR>
not, precisely what the variance from perfection is, referencing a
<BR>
compendium of collected spectra of previously analysed defective bots.
<BR>
Simple acoustic spectroscopy might do the trick.  Grab the bot.  Give it a
<BR>
whack.  Listen to the returning hum/vibration.  Move on to the next bot.
<BR>
If you catch a bot between cycles, you don't even have any down time.
<BR>
<P>I don't know, maybe I'm completely out of my depth here.  But it really
<BR>
seems like you're imagining that it will be &quot;hard&quot; because, well,
<BR>
...because no one knows how to do it yet.  Comes back to what my boy Ray says.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
