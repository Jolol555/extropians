It appears as if Charlie Stross &lt;<A HREF="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20The%20end%20of%20Apocalypses?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002031320.OAA25360@color.sics.se&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</A>&gt; wrote:

<BR>

<BR>
<P>Apocalypsies come and go.
<BR>
<P>The Western religion nuts simply showed that they had no clue, just as
<BR>
the Eastern religion nuts.
<BR>
<P>I think your friend subscribes to optimism.  I see no reason to assume
<BR>
that stupidity will lessen in the new millenium.  According to some old
<BR>
saying, even the gods themselves lose against stupidity.  Stupidity just
<BR>
re-groups.
<BR>
<P>|Yes, this ignores the Singularity, McKenna's wibblings, and related non-
<BR>
|religious apocalypses. But the point that interests me is that if the
<BR>
|Christians stop jumping up and down shrieking &quot;the sky is falling!&quot;
<BR>
|because they're run out of messianic deadlines, politics and cultural
<BR>
|life will take an interesting turn.
<BR>
<P>It simply ignores all the scientifically oriented religions, then. Like us. !-P
<BR>
[How long will it take for extropianism and transhumanism to become religions?]
<BR>
<P>+                                    (Which of Ronald Reagan's advisors
<BR>
|on public policy was it who advised cutting the EPA's budget because 
<BR>
|because the Rapture was due to carry all the good guys away long before 
<BR>
|the environment could be damaged irreparably?)
<BR>
<P>I presume the advisor took the comet, and thus have left us..
<BR>
<P>|I'd like to segue this into a discussion of the ethics of immortality,
<BR>
|but all my tired brain will come up with right now is the idea that when
<BR>
|a society stops anticipating its imminent demise and is forced to raise
<BR>
|its eyes and contemplate a vista of centuries stretching into its future,
<BR>
|the change of perspective is going to have _interesting_ effects ...
<BR>
<P>Yes, ethanol users experience tired brains as part of their trip. !-/
<BR>
<P>|Anyone got any ideas?
<BR>
<P>Maybe the mighty ``Millenium Blues'' appears?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Hey!  It's 3rd millenium already!  Nothing has changed. Sob...
<BR>
&nbsp;We might just as well &lt;whatever&gt;...&quot;
<BR>
<P>If humans can expect to not die, then would not killing them become more
<BR>
unethical than before?  Expect a guerilla group to form, which wants to
<BR>
kill off those who use anti-ageing techniques.
<BR>
<P>Maybe we can expect U.S. courts to punish with 1375 years imprisonment, as
<BR>
the culprits now could actually survive the term. !-/  Or will anti-ageing
<BR>
drugs become illegal to use for people in U.S. prisons?
