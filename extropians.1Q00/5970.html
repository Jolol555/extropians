Yeah, hey I'm down with that. If somebody said &quot;Give me a $100 million and 
<BR>
I'll cure death&quot; they'd have my $100 million in a heartbeat. By the same 
<BR>
token if someone said &quot;Give *me* a $100 million and I'll end hunger and 
<BR>
poverty&quot; they'd have my money in the same heartbeat. Problem is nobody is 
<BR>
saying either one. So today, if I had a $100 million, I guess I'd give it to 
<BR>
Foresight.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Zero, would this be your whole fortune or just a small part of it? lol!  If 
<BR>
I were a billionaire I would give things a push by doing the following.
<BR>
<P>Prometheus Project- I invest (not donate) fifty million into it and let Paul 
<BR>
Wakfer go full-bore on his dream of reversible suspension.
<BR>
<P>Advanced BioSciences- Fifty million donation (or even better an investment 
<BR>
with stock ownership) to achieve total brain vitrification.  Cryonet 
<BR>
subscribers would rejoice!
<BR>
<P>21st Century Medicine- Fifty million dollar investment for longevity 
<BR>
research.  Saul Kent and Mike Darwin would leap for joy!
<BR>
<P>Foresight Institute- Twenty million dollar donation.
<BR>
Drexler could really lobby his views then!
<BR>
<P>Extropian Institute- Twenty million dollar donation.
<BR>
All debts paid up!  A nice HQ and even a staff!  Max could quit his day job! 
<BR>
lol!
<BR>
<P>Natasha-Vita More Art Gallery- Twenty million dollar donation so she has 
<BR>
enough room to spread out all her past work and projects! lol  Also to 
<BR>
promote the transhuman artwork of others.
<BR>
<P>The Singularity Institute- Ten million start up investment money.  I'd give 
<BR>
our resident AI programming expert 40% ownership.  Later a U.S. intelligence 
<BR>
agency shows up at the door and gives us a &quot;deal we can't refuse&quot; to work 
<BR>
with them.
<BR>
<P>Alcor- Twenty million donation.  They can get out of debt and implement new 
<BR>
21st Century Medicine suspension techniques.
<BR>
<P>Cryonics Institute- Twenty million donation.  They are already out of debt 
<BR>
so they could upgrade their suspension protocols somewhat (get Alcor off 
<BR>
their back, lol) and install steel cable reinforcements around suspendees in 
<BR>
case of tornado(an idea never carried out).
<BR>
<P>That's my wish list!  If only I could actually do it.  I highly doubt my 
<BR>
very wealthy great-uncle will be leaving me his fortune! lol  I love to see 
<BR>
how solid funding could advance the cause of cryonics and perhaps even stop 
<BR>
the bickering between cryonicist leaders that results I believe from the 
<BR>
frustration of having such limited resources.
<BR>
<P>I would think the transhumanist movement would have a billioniare patron 
<BR>
like Ted Turner or Robert Bigelow to help us.  Why don't we?  I hope from 
<BR>
among our ranks we can produce one. lol
<BR>
<P>I have a friend who told me that if I wanted to become wealthy that instead 
<BR>
of college I should go into a trade like plumbing or electrical and also get 
<BR>
generalist repair skills.  And then as I can afford to I should purchase 
<BR>
'fixer-uppers' and fix them up for a tidy profit when sold or rented out.  
<BR>
This is what he is now doing now and he is doing well.  He is a city bus 
<BR>
driver who is also into investing (been doing it for years) and building and 
<BR>
selling computers.  I admire him for his wide range of interests and what he 
<BR>
has accomplished though a 'non-professional.'  He is not on the road to 
<BR>
being a billionaire but his net worth is over a million and rising.  A very 
<BR>
cool guy.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
