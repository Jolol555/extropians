<P><EM>&gt;  OK, fine !  Be it so.  I can live with being called a justificationalist. 
</EM><BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P>An old biography categorized me in &quot;analytic philosopher&quot; which is 
<BR>
justificationalist.  That is ok because it places me right along with Carnap 
<BR>
and Ayer, two of my heros. (and now you have joined the group -- 
<BR>
Wittgenstein, Frege, Russell, Vienna Circle, Uppsala, Lvov-Warsaw Circle).  
<BR>
This group lead to liguistic philosophy, pragmatism, logical empiricism 
<BR>
(positivism -- e.g., Stephen Hawking). . . not too shabby, I'd say.  (BTW I 
<BR>
curently s/b catagorized as PCR/CCR non-justificationalist.  I admit I 
<BR>
changed direction).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Make up a new word for this concept or call them &quot;survivors.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  OK, that would seem to be a fine solution.  I like this &quot;survivors&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  terminology !!  It is nonsense to say that a theory is 'true' or 'false', 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  should say that the theory is a 'survivor' or 'non-survivor' meme.  Nice 
</EM><BR>
!! 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But you did *not* explain here 
</EM><BR>
*why* justificationalism is unnecessary, you only quoted authorities who say 
<BR>
so.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>That is how Popper solved Hume's &quot;problem of induction.&quot;  The main reason 
<BR>
(non-authoritrarian reason) is that _Deduction_ is used in place of 
<BR>
_Induction_.  That is &quot;Why.&quot;  No one else has been able to do that as far as 
<BR>
I know.  The anthology editied Radnitzky and Bartley is the best place I know 
<BR>
to read about this.  This anthology has an many con- as pro- articles and 
<BR>
seems well balanced.
