<P><EM>&gt; I walked past a woman in the metro tonight.  She had one young child

<EM>&gt; standing beside her and another infant in her arms.  The arm holding

<EM>&gt; the infants head ended in an outstretched palm.  At the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the passage was a seemingly talented flutist playing not sad, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not happy tunes.  I noticed a 10 ruble (~$.30) note in his flute case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whom should I have helped -- both, neither?  I really don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anymore.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why &quot;should&quot; you have helped either one ?  
<BR>
<P>If you had given the woman money, then what would your reasons have been for 
<BR>
giving her money ?
<BR>
If you had given the flutist money, then what would your reasons have been
<BR>
for giving him money ?
<BR>
<P>Additional question to both of the last questions: Are your resources not 
<BR>
better spent on yourself -- or on not worrying about issues like this -- 
<BR>
rather than on these people ?  Is the single fact alone that they bother your 
<BR>
peaceful and non-offensive existence and beg you for money a significant 
<BR>
reason why *you* should waste precious seconds of brain CPU time on ethical 
<BR>
qualms concerning them ? 
<BR>
<P>A rational selfish person might consider doing something like this: do not 
<BR>
give any money but invest in the child(ren) the woman is burdened with by 
<BR>
giving a list of easily-avaiable (from public library e.g.) books with some 
<BR>
basic math and philosophy.  Or give a short ''fatherly'' :-) talk about the 
<BR>
very real possibility of lifting yourself from misery through self-teaching 
<BR>
available to even the poorest person with just a minimum of belief in 'Dynamic 
<BR>
Optimism' :-).  Or some other thing in that vein.  That kind of solution 
<BR>
doesn't even cost you any money. -- And maybe gives you a bigger satisfaction 
<BR>
about just possibly having done something real (I mean: some investment which 
<BR>
might in some way pay off to you yourself !) than giving money which probably 
<BR>
would only bring some very-short-term alleviation of pain/hunger/etc. and 
<BR>
thereby only help prolong their misery.  
<BR>
<P>I mean: turn the situation around and try to figure out how you can expoit the 
<BR>
situation to further your own position/interests.  If investment in them and 
<BR>
construction of a cooperation with them in such a way that *you* also benefit 
<BR>
from it is not possible, then the best (and incidentally also the kindest
<BR>
and most 'humane') course of action (IMO) definitely is **not to interfere** -- 
<BR>
just ignore them and don't run the risk that by interfering you might only 
<BR>
contribute to prolonging their misery. 
<BR>
<P>Very best greetings,   Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20Selfishness%20(Was:%20Re:%20Polemics%20for%20longevity)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000123230718.680A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
