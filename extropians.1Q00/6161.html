<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The way I see it transparency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; helps to further this goal, not to inhibit it, particularly where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; transparency if two-way and power equivolent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;And I do not.  Imagine this.  You live in a society where most people
</EM><BR>
find
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gays repulsive and quite a few are willing to kill gays.  The majority,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;let's say, doesn't care about gays dying per se, especially if they see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;certain gays having lots of mind blowing anal sex many times a week or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;night.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Come on.  Get real.  It is illegal to murder people, regardless of whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are gay or how much &quot;mind blowing anal sex&quot; they enjoy.  And the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the matter is that those laws are enforced.  Sure there was a time when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you were black in America you had no rights which any white man was
</EM><BR>
bound
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to honor.  Those days are passed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on where you are, really.  Three people were recently murdered in
<BR>
NYC by the police there.  In at least one of the cases -- the Diallo one --
<BR>
the police were acquitted.  Granted, there was not ubiquitous surveillance
<BR>
(even if there were, judging intentions would still be hard), but the point
<BR>
is this stuff still does go on.
<BR>
<P>I was only using gays as an example.  Another example, the Branch Davidians
<BR>
were basically killed by the FBI in plain sight with all sorts of intensive
<BR>
surveillance going on, yet most Americans do not care about it or think the
<BR>
government did the right thing.  (I recall opinion polls at the time giving
<BR>
somewhere around 80% approval for the FBI's actions there.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I never said transparency will necessarily bring about an end to all
</EM><BR>
illegal
<BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior.  What it will do is *guarantee* that the perpetrator is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identified, caught and convicted.  That's about all any social policy can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hope to do.  To cure people of criminal tendencies you need to look to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuroscientists, and maybe the philosophers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not asking for ubiquitous surveillance to guarantee social perfection.
<BR>
My point is that it would only accenuate current imperfections.  I think
<BR>
this is what some of Zero's other critics are getting at too.  The only
<BR>
thing ubiquitous surveillanca will guarantee, I believe, is, at least
<BR>
temporarily ubiquitous surveillance.  The rest depends on what people do
<BR>
with it is what is at issue here.  But this is true of any social policy.
<BR>
If one advocates, e.g., capital punishment, one could argue that murderers
<BR>
should die for their crime.  I would agree, but, as a practical matter, if
<BR>
we wrongfully capitally punish (kill) an innocent, how do undo that?  We can
<BR>
disconnect things to examine them in our head, but when the tire meets the
<BR>
road, we have to look at what will most likely happen.  Human history is
<BR>
awash in blood -- mostly spilled by people who meant well and adopted
<BR>
seemingly rational policies without examining what these policies might do
<BR>
in the real world.
<BR>
<P>I'm waxing rhetorical here.:/
<BR>
<P>Let me give a more realistic example.  Drug use in the US and many countries
<BR>
is illegal.  To a large extent, drug use is also unpopular.  With ubiquitous
<BR>
surveillance, imagine how many pot smokers will be jailed, perhaps for long
<BR>
terms.  (This is a good example because with D.A.R.E. programs in the US,
<BR>
there already are people turning in their relatives, friends, teachers, etc.
<BR>
to the police.  D.A.R.E. programs basically teach school aged kids that the
<BR>
cops are fine people and that if anyone is using drugs the police should be
<BR>
told.  This is one step closer to ubiquitous surveillance in a basically
<BR>
democratic society.)  Surely, no one here thinks this a fine use ubiquitous
<BR>
surveillance, but it would be a likely use if we had it now.
<BR>
