<P>
All,
<BR>
<P>BBC TV screened it's program &quot;Heart of the matter&quot; at 11:50PM GMT on
<BR>
Sunday.  Was pure luck I even found out, happened to spot it in the TV
<BR>
guide by sheer luck!
<BR>
<P>The first half of this program contained a section on life extension
<BR>
delivered by Nick Bostrom of the WTA, and contained interviews with Max
<BR>
More and Natasha Vita More.  After that, they had a discussion with Nick
<BR>
himself, along with a Neurologist (I think), an environmentalist, and of
<BR>
course a theologian (there was another guy, can't remember what he did, one
<BR>
of the sciences I think).
<BR>
<P>I found the host to be reasonably fair, and Nick did a fine job.  However,
<BR>
I get the feeling the environmentalist guy and the theologian missed the
<BR>
plot.  She was going on about needing death and old age in order to &quot;value&quot;
<BR>
youth and such.  The usual arguments about missing friends, boredom etc.
<BR>
were brought out...  Also the idea of &quot;making space&quot; for the next
<BR>
generation was raised.  When Nick responded on that issue they didn't seem
<BR>
to have much of a response, and the discussion moved on...
<BR>
<P>The Env. guy seemed to be standard scare monger stuff, even appealing
<BR>
directly to the camera at one point to press his message across.  He also
<BR>
brought up the overpopulation argument, to which Nick responded with the
<BR>
facts about population decline in the west.  To the Env. guy's credit, he
<BR>
did bring up the point about inequality in the distribution of the benefits
<BR>
of technology in the developing world.  Not sure what that has to do with
<BR>
us striving to become better than we are though:)  His main objection was
<BR>
&quot;finite resources&quot;, and that he felt living for an extended length of time
<BR>
would be some kind of additional drain on the planet.
<BR>
<P>The neurologist to be fair to her was fairly level headed, even bringing up
<BR>
the idea of 0-4C body freezing in order to live a &quot;punctuated&quot; extended
<BR>
life, ala Benjamin Franklin I guess.  It seemed obvious that none of them
<BR>
had any previous exposure to TransH/Extropian ideas.  The other scientist
<BR>
guy seemed cautious but optimistic about the future.  Both of the science
<BR>
orientated people seemed the most level-headed IMO.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately I felt that it was too short a time, and that given longer
<BR>
Nick would have had more opportunity to shine, in between the
<BR>
'responsibility to die for our children' diatribes....  I'm sure he could
<BR>
have easily showed them the dead ends in their ways of thinking, but I
<BR>
suppose it's at least some exposure for our ideals.  Maybe it'll get some
<BR>
people investigating.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, that's my take on it.  Would like to say well done to Nick for an
<BR>
excellent overview and for his composed stance in the debate!
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P><P>James.....
