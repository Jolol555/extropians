<P>
<EM>&gt; To be more precise, such a science might predict your beliefs at any stage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a cognitive process; I see no reason to focus on some mythical &quot;end.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And let's not get distracted by the straw-person of perfect prediction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It could be plenty useful if predictions were just much better than random.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't forget what's supposed to make your argument work.  In your orginal
<BR>
case, you hypothesized a scientific crystal ball which would predict ALL
<BR>
of my ethical beliefs. The fact that I'm going to believe X *normally*
<BR>
doesn't provide any argument at all for believing X now, but the fact that
<BR>
I'll believe X at the end of inquiry *does* provide me with reason to
<BR>
believe X.  Even if there is no end of inquiry, simply mapping out all of
<BR>
my beliefs for the rest of my life would be enough for empirical science
<BR>
to (by definition) tell me everything I'm capable of knowing about ethics.
<BR>
<P>Call this the argument from the best answer: the crystal ball is
<BR>
guaranteed to give the best answer I'll ever come up with, and for this
<BR>
reason (and only for this reason) I ought to believe the ball.
<BR>
<P>If your scientific process falls short of that, then the argument that I
<BR>
can't do better than the crystal ball fails.  What's more, it's a dismal
<BR>
failure if it fails at all, because *nothing* like the argument from the
<BR>
best answer applies to this cloudier crystal ball.  What reason have I to
<BR>
believe what the cloudier crystal ball tells me?  What argument can you
<BR>
give that the fact that I will (might?) believe X in the future shows that
<BR>
I ought to believe X now?
<BR>
<P>In fact, you can't give me *any* such argument without getting your hands
<BR>
dirty and doing some non-empirical moral philosophy, and *that's* what I'm
<BR>
trying to show: you can't do the whole thing empirically, you have to do
<BR>
at least some of the job non-empirically.
<BR>
<P>The only crystal ball which wields its own ethical argument is the one
<BR>
which predicts all of my beliefs perfectly; anything less, and you'll need
<BR>
to provide me with a moral argument to back up the claims of the ball.  
<BR>
And, as I've argued, these are impossibly high standards for a scientific
<BR>
process to reach.  No experiment can reach these criteria, and any
<BR>
experiment that fails to reach these criteria won't tell me anything about
<BR>
ethics by itself.
<BR>
<P>But once you've gotten your hands dirty, it's no longer an empirical
<BR>
science: it has an empirical element to it (and this, I think, nobody
<BR>
doubts is the case about ethics) but it isn't PURELY empirical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And let's keep our eye on the key claim at issue: can one study ethics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; via scientific methods?  You complained that evolutionary psychology folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were pretending to study ethics, while instead ethics is just a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world; no factual statements are relevant to judging ethical statements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Point of interest: that's a gross oversimplification.  I'm simply making
<BR>
the standard can't-derive-ought-from-is argument.  Beginning with a moral
<BR>
premise, factual statements can and do come into play in determining which
<BR>
actions are moral and which aren't.  However, I do hold that empirical
<BR>
matters *alone* won't tell me anything about ethics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am saying that ethics is part of science, just as other cognitive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social sciences are.  You *can* learn about what is right by empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; study.
</EM><BR>
<P>Via a hypothetical experiment which can't actually be performed?  Not very
<BR>
good science, if you ask me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The standard of a science of ethics isn't the ability of it to predict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some mythical &quot;end&quot; of ethical inquiry, any more than the standard of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solar physics is to predict the final end of the sun, billions of years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after humans may have vastly changed the galaxy.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but physics has instrumental use when its answers are close, but not
<BR>
quite right.  Of what use is the cloudy crystal ball?  What reason do I
<BR>
have to believe that the ethical beliefs the cloudy ball reports I'll have
<BR>
are actually right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can't say that science is irrelevant if it can't predict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly.  And it is far from obvious that ethical opinion is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximally opaque computation which can only be predicted by running it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly many other things that brains do can be predicted, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in principle brains could make it very hard to predict them, if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried hard at it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, science has USE as an approximation.  What argument can you provide
<BR>
that the cloudy crystal ball would be right *at all*?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You're trying to make this a choice of extremes: either science must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predict everything exactly, and do it soon damn it, or the subject (ethics)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just not a scientific subject; it is fundamentally different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This same attitude would say &quot;scientists shouldn't pretend to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding love; there's no way science could exactly predict who I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would love at the end of the universe, since I could work hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make that unpredictable.  Thus love and science are just two different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>An approximate science of love can tell me useful facts about lovers
<BR>
BEFORE the end of the universe.  What useful facts about ethics can a
<BR>
cloudy crystal ball provide me?
<BR>
