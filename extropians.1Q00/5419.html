<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Right now only the military and the police are allowed to have special

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; armed masses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well normally I would too but in this case the poorly armed masses have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; access to AWACS and it's brothers or the spy sat net or remote pilotless recon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There may be a few thousand night vision equipped survivalists but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your average Joe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These things are more useless than you might imagine when you consider 1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no easy way to discern friend from foe, since it is a domestic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation and the &quot;enemy&quot; is not composed of obvious military columns, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) it would take a lot of resources to effectively monitor even a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; region of the land that makes up the U.S.; many U.S. states are the size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of European countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>And your average infantryman is not equipped with night vision
<BR>
technology. These are reserved for special forces units, tanks,
<BR>
choppers, and some limited regular forces that act in support of specwar
<BR>
operations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, if I had to guess a number based on various correlations and my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience, I would estimate that there are around 250,000 private citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the U.S. whose equipment and training is as good or better than your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average U.S. Infantry soldier today.  Realize also that most people in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military are REMFs (i.e. administrative and support personnel) and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very marginal combat capability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Additionally, police units would get eaten alive in any real military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action and are really only useful for herding mostly-unarmed civilians.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interestingly, there have been a couple cases in recent U.S. history where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilian police units have engaged military units (too off-topic to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into here) and were quickly decimated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ammunition would be in short supply...surely to be targeted first by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ugly big brother.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ammunition would not run out unless there was a prolonged full-scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shooting war, and even then it is unlikely to be an issue.  Realize that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; U.S. shooters purchase *billions* of rounds of ammunition every year.  Not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only that, but most gun owners I know have hundreds or thousands of rounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available at any given time.
</EM><BR>
<P>And many gun owners are into reloading, and have extensive tools for
<BR>
this 'hobby'.
<BR>
it isn't difficult to set up a small gun powder plant, given emergency
<BR>
conditions. Black powder is easy, and nitro-cellulose is not much
<BR>
tougher to make. Making mercury fulminate is a bit tougher, and getting
<BR>
the chemicals can be made difficult, but most of the difficulty is in
<BR>
the risks of manufacture when you are inexperienced.
<BR>
<P>Getting used brass is easy. I know plenty of people who have bins of
<BR>
hundreds of thousands of spent rounds. Casting bullets, lead ball or
<BR>
copper jacketed, is also relatively easy (of course with toxic risks
<BR>
that need to be planned for).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you take a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto uprising, it takes very few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bullets to &quot;upgrade&quot; your weapons to whatever your oppressor is using.
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent point, and one that isn't recognised by those that disagree.
<BR>
AFAIK, the ghetto uprising began with  a small group, where one man
<BR>
volunteered to get guns for others. He had been given a small revolver.
<BR>
Most every other gun used in the uprising was captured from Nazi guards
<BR>
that were caught unawares.
