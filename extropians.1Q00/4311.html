<P>
Damien provide an interesting link to Chris Lawson's
<BR>
Essay on aging and longevity.  Attached is the letter
<BR>
that I sent to Chris regarding this essay (with which
<BR>
I mostly agree).
<BR>
<P>Robert
<BR>
==============================================================
<BR>
Chris,
<BR>
<P>I have read your essay:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tithonus Option is Not an Option @
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~claw/tithonus0.htm">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~claw/tithonus0.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>A great deal of research in this area has been done by
<BR>
James Fries, from Stanford.  The abstracts for some of
<BR>
his papers related to this topic can be found @
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/">http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/</A>
<BR>
<P>I would generally agree with his analysis that we will
<BR>
see a compression of morbidity as we approach the limits
<BR>
of the body as engineered.  The part that is always left
<BR>
out of the discussion however is the &quot;re-engineering&quot;
<BR>
of the human body.  To the degree that we accomplish
<BR>
that through replacement organs, hormonal promotion
<BR>
of stem cells (particularly neuronal) and eventually
<BR>
develop strategies to entirely replace cells and/or genomes
<BR>
(explored to some degree in the recently published Nanomedicine
<BR>
by Robert Freitas), we will bypass the limits imposed by Nature's
<BR>
incomplete program and become your &quot;Gurskian immortals&quot;.
<BR>
<P>At the December American Society for Anti-Aging medicine
<BR>
conference in Las Vegas, during my discussion of trends
<BR>
in biotechnology from genomes to biobots to nanobots,
<BR>
I included a slide similar to those in your paper.  It
<BR>
pointed out that given the current U.S. accident rate,
<BR>
the average Gurskian life expectancy would be about 2000
<BR>
years.  These large numbers are are clearly not relevant
<BR>
with regard to personal or societal planning.  The fundamental
<BR>
question as has been discussed periodically among the Extropians
<BR>
and Transhumanists is at what point technology advances will
<BR>
be adding a year of life expectancy every year.
<BR>
<P>I would optimistically/pessimistically put the dates for
<BR>
that transition between 20 and 40 years from now.  I would
<BR>
disagree somewhat with your conclusions that we do not face a
<BR>
window for the &quot;Tithonus Option&quot; (long lived with minimal quality).
<BR>
Much depends on the degree to which drugs currently in the
<BR>
research pipeline manage to delay the onset and progression
<BR>
of Alzheimer's and related illnesses.  If those drugs work
<BR>
and become available to large numbers of individuals so we
<BR>
maintain a relative rates of brain/body aging then the
<BR>
situation appears good.  Relatively older people (&gt;60?),
<BR>
will age fairly uniformly and then die.  Relatively younger
<BR>
people (&lt;30?), will take advantage of the emerging technologies
<BR>
and become Gurskians.
<BR>
<P>If, however, our body enhancing technologies progress faster
<BR>
than our brain enhancing technologies, we may yet face
<BR>
a time when we can indefinately preserve individuals whose
<BR>
quality of life (brain awareness/activity) is minimal.
<BR>
In this situation we could end up with a fraction of the
<BR>
population being preserved with a very low quality of life.
<BR>
<P>Whether or not this occurs depends a lot on how societies
<BR>
invest in and apply medical technologies and the laws they
<BR>
develop regarding things like pre-death cryonic suspension
<BR>
(which would allow people to take a calculated risk before
<BR>
their brains had lost most of the structure required for
<BR>
a life with quality).
<BR>
<P>I'll be posting a copy of this letter to the Extropian mailing
<BR>
list for discussion there.
