<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
As some of you know my email has been problematic lately.  This was
<BR>
due to my intentionally allowing the &quot;aeiveos.com&quot; domain name
<BR>
to expire at Network Solutions, in anticipation of moving it to
<BR>
a more courteous and responsive domain provider.  After eNom
<BR>
wrestled with this for 3-4 weeks unsuccessfully, I finally
<BR>
called Network Solutions.  It turns out that the *bastards*
<BR>
will not turn over a domain name unless the registration is
<BR>
paid-in-full (even if it is requested by the &quot;holder&quot;).  They
<BR>
would not even *delete* the domain name in a timely fashion (&lt; 30 days),
<BR>
so I could reregister it elsewhere, forcing me to fork over
<BR>
$35 to the spawn of Saten.
<BR>
<P>My recomendation -- damn NSI's name every opportunity you get a
<BR>
chance and watch carefully for the bubble to burst on the
<BR>
valuation ($21 bill) paid by Verisign (VRSN) for NSI (NSOL).
<BR>
Unless NSI changes its way of doing business customers are going
<BR>
to leave them in droves, if anyone can provide even marginally
<BR>
better service.
<BR>
<P>Although Slashdot had a discussion about DNS registrars a
<BR>
couple of weeks ago, the results seemed fairly inconclusive.
<BR>
I'm unhappy with eNom (they only sometimes answer their phone
<BR>
and were unable to inform me that NSI would not transfer the
<BR>
domain).  Does anyone know of a reliable approved DNS registrar
<BR>
who provides responsive and courteous service, that would also
<BR>
follow the privacy &amp; personal rights you would expect for an
<BR>
Extropian -- e.g. the domain name is *my* property and others
<BR>
aren't to use it for their purposes?  [If we can't find one of these,
<BR>
its something that ExI might take on as a privacy/rights issue that
<BR>
would bring some income into the organization.]
<BR>
<P>Now, onto the SPAM issue.  Since aeiveos.com seems to have
<BR>
popped back up as being valid in the DNS system, that I'm
<BR>
now getting a flood of SPAM messages to relay.  Unfortunately
<BR>
I've been procrastinating implementing the changes to the
<BR>
rather old software on my systems that allow SPAM relays to
<BR>
take advantage of me.  Since my machines may have been &quot;advertised&quot;
<BR>
as a SPAM relay point, it seemed to make sense to take advantage
<BR>
of this if possible and turn it against the evildoers.
<BR>
<P>Premise: If people are using your systems to relay mail (and you
<BR>
can track it), then you should be able to bill them for the services.
<BR>
If they refuse to pay for the services, then you can have them jailed
<BR>
for grand-theft.  Of course for SPAMers, one wants to set
<BR>
a fairly high price ($100/message relayed).  The complementary
<BR>
efforts of anti-SPAM programs and costs to or jailing of a few
<BR>
purveyors of this crap should function as a greater anti-SPAM
<BR>
effect than programs alone can manage.  [Why?  Because programs
<BR>
alone only encourage SPAMers to get more clever, as I will show
<BR>
below.]
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting that Washington State is one of the states that
<BR>
does have anti-SPAM legislation, though I'm unsure of the degree
<BR>
to which it could be used in this case (and you have the problem
<BR>
of jurisdiction).
<BR>
<P>Now, the problem at hand...  Attached is an example of the many messages
<BR>
being relayed through my mail system (converted to HTML).  The
<BR>
&quot;Received: from&quot; lines show up as being from at least 3 sources
<BR>
so it is questionable if any are valid.  The target URL is
<BR>
very cleverly encoded and appears (in my limited knowledge)
<BR>
to perhaps bounce a URL through several relays(?) [www.freeyellow.com
<BR>
and angelfire.com].  The actual IP address of the server is cleverly
<BR>
hidden as a decimal number as well.  We are dealing with the Aristoi
<BR>
of Spamers IMO.
<BR>
<P>The adverstisment is cleverly coded so they can call you and you can't
<BR>
call them (or their ISP, if you are at my ability level, which is
<BR>
certainly greater than the average Joe).  So, the question becomes
<BR>
how do we decode the information to either make them pay for my
<BR>
services or stop it entirely (clearly preferable!).
<BR>
<P>For now, I've turned off my smtp daemon so I cannot accept the SPAM.
<BR>
I may turn it back on when I can target to a &quot;black hole&quot; the incoming
<BR>
requests.  Fortunately most of the destination email systems will not
<BR>
accept the relayed mail, so the net result is for the SPAM to accumulate
<BR>
on my system and suck up my bandwidth to the destinations.
<BR>
<P>Just so I don't get painted black, the last time I checked, there
<BR>
were many thousdands of systems worldwide that had the same type of
<BR>
open email relays that are on my systems.  So I'm not alone.
<BR>
<P>If you are inclined to help me with this, please respond to:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com.
<BR>
since the aeiveos.com domain isn't accepting email.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Robert
