<EM>&gt;Entire themed conventions full of people looking like

<EM>&gt;Neo and Trinity, or Buffy and Angel, or Marge and Homer...

<EM>&gt;A convention of Buffy's?  Kewwwalllll....  {8^D----------------------
</EM><BR>
<P>How many times have you seen &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; Eliezer??  My friends and I 
<BR>
saw it last summer on video and they howled at the sexual machiavelliism.  I 
<BR>
don't know if you would like &quot;Buffy&quot; being a bad girl, though. :)
<BR>
<P>Star Trek conventions will take on a whole new meaning when fans can REALLY 
<BR>
look like their favorite character!  Every other gal looking like seven of 
<BR>
nine or Dax (just as hot in my opinion) would be fantastic.  And I warn you 
<BR>
all, don't attend an H.P. Lovecraft/Call of Cthulhu convention!!  I must 
<BR>
admit I wouldn't mind an X-files convention with alot of agent Scully's 
<BR>
walking around... :)
<BR>
<P>Could you imagine highschool in the year 2070?  &quot;Oh, look at Julia, she 
<BR>
still is using the retro Cindy Crawford body mod, how out of date!&quot;  And in 
<BR>
the student handbook there would be a long list of body mods that are 
<BR>
strictly forbidden!  Bioscanners at all exits would detect any hidden 
<BR>
modifications.
<BR>
<P>How many people here have read the science fiction novel &quot;Armed Memory?&quot;  It 
<BR>
has a character who is the Bill Gates of body mod tech and as his trademark 
<BR>
is always seen in different forms.  The villians are a gang/cult of body 
<BR>
modifiers who have taken on the humanoid form and function of deadly 
<BR>
hammerhead sharks!  Their leadership live deep in the ocean as true sharks 
<BR>
the size of blue whales.  It was a fun and also short read with good 
<BR>
characters and suspense.
<BR>
<P>In the a recent Wired issue, author Neil Gaiman said how he looks forward to 
<BR>
parties where he sees body mods so extreme people have a gold fish aquarium 
<BR>
as a functioning &quot;eye&quot; in their face and feathers growing out their back.  
<BR>
The future should be interesting.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
