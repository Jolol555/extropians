<EM>&gt; &gt;    how you &quot;appear&quot;.  Its just going to be much more flexible.

<EM>&gt; You're going to keep a physical appearance?  What for?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that in the long run we will probably be entities of
<BR>
pure thought, but during the evolutionary period, I don't think
<BR>
many would survive a situation in which they went from being
<BR>
embodied to disembodied overnight.  You lose a *lot* of &quot;hooks&quot;
<BR>
on which concepts based on sensory experiences rest.  Question:
<BR>
what fraction of language(s) would you lose if there were no
<BR>
physical &quot;senses&quot;?  (colors, sounds, positional concepts, perhaps
<BR>
some emotions, etc.)  They might be replaced by physical science
<BR>
specifications or mathematical representations but that requires
<BR>
training in quite different perception and throught processes
<BR>
than most of us currently have.
<BR>
<P>Until we develop a meme set and a language (object exchange protocols?)
<BR>
for the disembodied, I think we are going to have to retain the illusion
<BR>
of having bodies.  You, Eliezer, are perhaps on the cutting edge
<BR>
of considering what may be required for these representations and
<BR>
exchanges.  I would suspect that 90+% of people who consider themselves
<BR>
transhumanists haven't thought very much about this problem perhaps
<BR>
in part because it is so hard to think about while we are still stuck
<BR>
in bodies.
