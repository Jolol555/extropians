<EM>&gt; I recently saw, _Mission to Mars_ which was good but not great.  I could
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; help but compare the ending of it with the final scenes of _2001_ which
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; infinitely better.  I noticed how in some ways they attempted to copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kubrick's masterpiece but were hopelessly inadequate in doing so.  The way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kubrick shifted the pov and used lighting and set design was sheer genius
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; showing Bowman's lifecycle.
</EM><BR>
<P>I saw &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; the day after it opened.  I went in expecting it to
<BR>
be bad and hoping that it would be merely mediocre.  That way, I'd feel
<BR>
happy for it be better than my expectations.  However, it was worse than my
<BR>
expectations.  A drippy sentimental _ predictable_ yet preposterous plot
<BR>
combined with decent special effects, a bad story idea, and melodramatic
<BR>
underacting (I didn't think that was possible).  It's definitely the worst
<BR>
science fiction film of 2000.  (I'm shocked to find myself saying
<BR>
&quot;Supernova&quot; and &quot;Pitch Black&quot; were better.:)  And it was way overhyped!
<BR>
<P>And the truly sad thing about it -- well, aside from the fact that I can't
<BR>
get my time spent watching it back:) -- is that there were some good ideas
<BR>
in the film and that any film tackling this subject now can go so many
<BR>
realistic ways.
<BR>
<P>Comparing it to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is like comparing Jewel's poems to
<BR>
those of Blake.:)  But even if the film were good, it would not be like
<BR>
&quot;2001&quot; simply because Kubrick was going down a different path.  (If you want
<BR>
a film that's similar to &quot;2001,&quot; see Takovsky's &quot;Solaris.&quot;)
