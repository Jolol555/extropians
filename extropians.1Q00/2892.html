&lt;&lt; Both statements point at the same phenomenon (have the same denotation)
<BR>
&nbsp;but may generate different emotional overtones, subjective interpretations,
<BR>
&nbsp;socio-cultural values, and ideological assumptions in humans reading them
<BR>
&nbsp;(have different connotations). &gt;&gt;

<P>&lt;&lt; It is not inappropriate to judge the character of the person giving the 
<BR>
idea, 
<BR>
&nbsp;as well as the so called &quot;rationale&quot; behind it. If I find that a person's 
<BR>
&nbsp;thinking is rude, rigid, uninformed, or perhaps just unskilled at 
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;interpersonal communications&quot; I will think that they are not a good source 
<BR>
&nbsp;-- or that their argument is based on personal bias.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>I want to add one more thing: 
<BR>
If I find that a person has not had the *same* life experiences than me, and 
<BR>
is not at all interested in considering mine - before they begin to 
<BR>
&quot;convince&quot; - or denounce my thoughts, that is also a reason not to want to 
<BR>
partake in the discussion. I am always open to theirs.... highly interested 
<BR>
in fact!!!
<BR>
<P>Much of what I learned, I learned by listening (or in this case reading) of 
<BR>
other people's learning and life experiences. IMO, if someone is not 
<BR>
interested in looking at the world in many ways, even if just to speculate on 
<BR>
&quot;what it might be like&quot; to think differently, they are not well rounded.
