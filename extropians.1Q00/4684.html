<EM>&gt; Yeah that is pure BS, the only shortages in domain names are those being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused by their non-allowance of arbitrary new TLDs. ICANN sucks! What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be interesting is if you had some alt registries, and the linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people put it into their default distros so that all their users started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the alt registries, would that eventually cause the other OS vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as M$ to include support for the registries in their products? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am really surprised no one in linux-land has come up with the idea for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;open source&quot; registries not sanctioned by ICANN.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good idea. How do we set up a registry?
<BR>
<P>here are some marketable tld's to set up:
<BR>
<P>.est 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as in badd.est, bigg.est, etc....) course you'd piss of the EST
<BR>
people...
<BR>
.inc
<BR>
.home
<BR>
.work
<BR>
.ist/.ism (for all those political philosophies)
<BR>
.1st (first)
<BR>
.corp
<BR>
.earth
<BR>
.terra
<BR>
.ing
<BR>
.hell
<BR>
<P>I've got my own web server I'm getting a DSL hookup for in a few weeks.
<BR>
If someone can do the registry server app, I'll load it. We want to set
<BR>
it up so that a person registering pays once for lifetime ownership,
<BR>
though what do we want for a squatting policy? 
<BR>
<P>I'm personally opposed to squatters who just grab sites, however I'm
<BR>
also opposed to treating domain names as trade marks, because the names
<BR>
are real estate addresses, not businesses (just as theoretically, I have
<BR>
a right to have an address on Microsoft Way in Redmond if there is any
<BR>
land available adjacent to it). How many businesses use 'Wall Street' in
<BR>
their names and are located on or near Wall Street? Do they get to force
<BR>
the city to change its street name? 
<BR>
<P>Another means of continuing income is to create an auction site for
<BR>
domain names on the registry.
