<P><EM>&gt; Most people would not say that we should fight tooth and nail against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  our children to prevent them from shoving us off the earth prematurely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Yet they will say exactly that with regard to our mind children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This sounds to me like mindless genetic programming talking, and needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to be better justified if we are going to seriously oppose AI because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of its potentially superior survival abilities.

I just read the April 2000 WIRED issue tonight and found it somehow 
<BR>
dispiriting. Very much a glum forecast for genetic tech and nanotech. This 
<BR>
was even from some of my favs like George Dyson.  Its like every section of 
<BR>
the article was a Silent Spring, or more like an On the Beach.  I would go 
<BR>
further then Moravec and say that the Mind Children are not merely our 
<BR>
successors, but in fact are us, complete.  I don't advocate embracing the 
<BR>
compu-future of the species till we actually materially see what that future 
<BR>
is.  If it turns out disappointing, we should always have the option of 
<BR>
staying meat and bone, till the tech is perfected
