<EM>&gt; Sounds like the propaganda war has begun. Which way do asian americans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (esp japanese americans) lean? Dem or GOP? Who ever they tend against is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably putting out these stories to reduce the reporting from these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demographic groups, since congressional district remappings are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determined by census data. Considering that the census is trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really discriminate (emphasis) between members of the different asian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; polynesian, and hispanic groups, I wouldn't be surprised that some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disinformation comes out about how bad the census is for those groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see two problems with Michael's view.  One is that the article, in fact,
<BR>
might be correct.  That is census data was used against Japanese Americans
<BR>
during WW2.  This should give pause.  Those who think it can't happen again
<BR>
might be wrong.  After all, the present U.S. government does _discriminate_
<BR>
based on race, gender, ethnicity, physical handicap, and age through various
<BR>
affirmative action programs.
<BR>
<P>Another is that redistricting itself is not necessarily an unmitigated good
<BR>
for so called minority groups it is supposed to help.  It remains to be seen
<BR>
what is the best way to form Congressional voting districts.  But so far,
<BR>
what a lot of recent redistricting has done is to reinforce incumbents (who
<BR>
vote on it:) and also to reduce the power of minorities in certain areas.
<BR>
Certainly, having a majority Latino district in New Jersey has put and keep
<BR>
Bob Menendez (House Democrat) in office.  But at the same time, the Latino
<BR>
vote has now been concentrated in one district.  Candidates and
<BR>
officeholders in other districts in NJ now need to do less to court the
<BR>
Latino vote.  I.e., all the surrounding districts are proportionately less
<BR>
Latino -- meaning that the Latino vote has less impact overall.  Formerly,
<BR>
it was spread of many districts.
<BR>
<P>This does not even touch on the issue of whether voting districts should be
<BR>
neutral to all these differences.  I believe they should be -- viz., that
<BR>
the government should NOT legally recognize races, ethnics groups, etc. --
<BR>
though I do not here offer an alternative plan.
<BR>
<P>And, of course, I wish all people, whatever their skin color, etc. would
<BR>
just vote Libertarian or not at all.:)
<BR>
<P>Happy Saturday!
