Thanks Anders, a note on your research below:

<EM>&gt; &gt; A word on effectiveness:  &lt;my summary snipped&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As the resident memory researcher, I would just like to add that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above seems to fit my knowledge of the field. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A further problem is that many of the memory enhancer drugs likely act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by increasing the plasticity of the hippocampus either directly or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through various relevance-signals. This would imply that they also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make forgetting faster, at least in intermediate memory. I have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new results that place constraints on this, but I have to wait until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paper is accepted before I start explaining more. (sorry)
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't seen any published papers that explore this, so I look forward to
<BR>
reading yours.  That having been said, I'm fascinated by a paper that shows
<BR>
something of the opposite.  Specifically, Christoffersen seemed to show in
<BR>
the Jun 98 issue of _Neuropharmacology_ that learning facilitated by
<BR>
Piracetam was harder to extinguish than unaugmented learning, to the point
<BR>
that it interfered with reversal learning (learning to make a different
<BR>
choice in the previously learned situation).  The abstract from Medline is
<BR>
below.
<BR>
<P>Also, one tangential observation:  The dosage levels they use in tests of
<BR>
nootropics on laboratory animals are incredibly large.  The experiment
<BR>
below, for example, would correspond to at least 15g of Piracetam for a
<BR>
human, or 6x the maximum recommended dosage.
<BR>
<P>&lt;ABSTRACT
<BR>
Neuropharmacology 1998 Jun;37(6):815-25 
<BR>
<P>Piracetam inhibits Pavlovian extinction and reversal learning in a spatial
<BR>
task for rats.

<BR>

<BR>
<P>Young male rats, trained in a spatial three-choice test, showed improved
<BR>
task acquisition after chronic treatment with piracetam (250 mg kg(-1)).
<BR>
After reaching a learning criterion, one group of animals was observed
<BR>
during Pavlovian extinction of the task skill and another group was assigned
<BR>
to reversal learning. The rate of extinction was slowed down in piracetam
<BR>
treated specimens compared to control animals. During reversal training, a
<BR>
new choice had to be learned while the previously acquired choice was no
<BR>
longer reinforced. Acquisition of the new skill was significantly impeded by
<BR>
piracetam in contrast to acquisition of the first skill, which was
<BR>
facilitated. Also during reversal learning, the piracetam treated group
<BR>
persevered longer than the control group in repeating the first acquired
<BR>
choice at the expense of learning the new choice. It is therefore suggested,
<BR>
that the impediment of reversal learning was caused by inhibition of
<BR>
extinction. In an open-field test, the time spent exploring in motion was
<BR>
increased by piracetam while the velocity of locomotion was unaffected by
<BR>
the drug. In a novelty test, piracetam increased the rate of loss of
<BR>
interactions with the novel object.
