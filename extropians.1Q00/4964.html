<P><EM>&gt; Hey, I love Eli like a son (not necessarily the most favorable comparison,

<EM>&gt; if one reads his autobiographic sketch, but still...), admire the hell out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of his smarts and articulateness, but let's not forget that so far all he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done is talk a good game.

<EM>&gt; (Even that might be putting it a little strongly: the only formal AI expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the list, Robin Hanson, has expressed misgivings over Eliezer's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broad-brush and non-canonical  algorithms/heuristics, and I haven't seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone cluey like Moravec or Vinge rush to adopt his schemata, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they both know about his site.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I may not be an AI specialist, but I am a computer scientist. My 
<BR>
opinion, for what its worth, is that Eli's suggestions have far too much 
<BR>
speculation and untested theory in them to work. On the other hand, his 
<BR>
ideas *feel* right. (More right than most AI proposals anyway.) So, if I 
<BR>
were funding AI research, I would think the ideas had enough merit to 
<BR>
invest in. When one is trying to advance the state of science, that is 
<BR>
often all one can hope for anyway.
