<EM>&gt;From Greg Burch:
</EM><BR>
&lt;The point of this digression is that the military think-tank establishment
<BR>
is already developing a mind-set that could evolve into one adaptable to
<BR>
&quot;nano-war&quot;: The factors described above in connection with anticipation of a
<BR>
strategic and tactical environment characterized by a tiered deployment of
<BR>
increasingly autonomous and smaller and smaller munitions seems capable of
<BR>
evolving into the ultimate development of &quot;robo-warfare&quot; at the molecular
<BR>
scale.&gt;
<BR>
<P>With the trend being to reduce &quot;collateral damage&quot; in military operations
<BR>
and to adopt sub-lethal weapons in police operations (because of a growing
<BR>
sensitivity on the part of an informed public?), couldn't the end result be
<BR>
the development of something with the equivalent effect of H.G.Wells' gas of
<BR>
peace in his film Things to Come? The mode of delivery pictured there would
<BR>
be impractical, but what about a subsubmunition resembling a swarm of gnats
<BR>
(with boring capabilities) delivering a sleeping gas by injection? To be
<BR>
followed by swift occupation and disarmament of the 'bad guys'. That's
<BR>
crude, but you get the idea.
