<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that the gov'ts with the best enforced environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  protection laws have the best environmental protection; this may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to do with how much they regulate their populations in other respects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Anyone care to disagree?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  BTW, I live in Hong Kong, where companies have much more freedom to pollute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  than in the US and take full advantage of it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consider that it may have less to do with the level of government regulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than it does with the quality of general civic consciousness in a particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; culture or region.  Common expectations of civil behavior may have as much to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do with how individuals AND institutions (governmental and business) act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toward both public and private goods than explicit law or regulation.
</EM><BR>
<P>No doubt, but we have little control over people's attitudes as a matter of
<BR>
public policy.  Yes, the HK gov't has tried for years to convince people that
<BR>
keeping the city clean would be better for everyone, but...
<BR>
<P>Also, I doubt that expectations of civic behavior significantly deter the really
<BR>
serious polluters (big oil companies?) when profits are at stake.
<BR>
<P>I used to live in Tokyo, BTW, and while the streets *are* a lot cleaner there
<BR>
than in HK because of Japanese cultural attitudes towards hygiene, I understand
<BR>
that the industrial pollution was almost as bad as in south China today before
<BR>
the gov't started cleaning it up.
