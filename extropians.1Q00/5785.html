I snipped the following from the &quot;World Population Implosion&quot; article:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In 1995, the ratio of population between &quot;less developed&quot; and &quot;more
<BR>
developed&quot; regions stood at about four to one; in 2050, by these
<BR>
projections, it would be seven to one. The balance of population would shift
<BR>
dramatically not only between given countries but even between entire
<BR>
continents. In 1995, for example, the estimated populations of Europe
<BR>
(including Russia) and Africa (including Egypt and the Maghreb states) were
<BR>
almost exactly equal. In 2050, by these projections, Africans would
<BR>
outnumber Europeans by over three to one.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I read an article sometime 18 to 24 months ago, online, it might have been
<BR>
&quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.  I believe it was titled &quot;A Remarkable Time&quot;.  I have
<BR>
tried a number of times to find it, after losing it a year or so ago.  It
<BR>
predicted that population will grow to about 9 or 10 billion in the next 40
<BR>
to fifty years.  Then it will slowly decrease.  What's next, after that, is
<BR>
pure speculation.
<BR>
<P>After reading the article, my concern was no longer increase in population,
<BR>
but rather where the increases are taking place.  If, in fact, our
<BR>
population almost doubles before beginning to decline, 100% of that increase
<BR>
will take place in earth's least population friendly places.  There will be
<BR>
4 billion more newbies in the poorest parts of the world, the places that
<BR>
haven't changed in millenia.  The &quot;have's&quot; will make up only a little over
<BR>
10% of the population, and the 2040s' version of today's high school
<BR>
educated, store clerk, single parent, living in a slumlord's hovel, without
<BR>
medical insurance, will be one of the &quot;haves&quot;.

<BR>
<P><P><P>In an effort to interject some additional &quot;facts&quot; into the discussion,
<BR>
see:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;World Population Implosion?&quot; @
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.pop.org/students/popimplode.html">http://www.pop.org/students/popimplode.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Also, the &quot;Population Reference Bureau&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.prb.org/">http://www.prb.org/</A>)
<BR>
has a number of publications.
<BR>
<P>As Billy pointed out, all doomsday predictions are based on no
<BR>
improvements in our technology base.  IMO, far more concerning
<BR>
than overpopulation would be the development of robotics or
<BR>
sub-AI that eliminates the needs for employing a large fraction
<BR>
of the population.  If we assume, for the moment, that most
<BR>
of the people on this list fall into the &quot;above average&quot; segment
<BR>
of the population (in intelligence, education, awareness, etc.),
<BR>
doesn't that give you pause to ask, just what does the &quot;below average&quot;
<BR>
segment of the population do?  And what will happen when they can
<BR>
be replaced by a reliable 24-hour-a-day robot/AI?
<BR>
<P>Is Moravec's Tax-the-robots environment feasible?  Would you as
<BR>
a robot owner operate your robots in a taxing jurisdiction?  Or
<BR>
would you move your operations to a robot-tax-free state?
<BR>
If the taxes on the robots are distributed to the people
<BR>
will it not be strange to be paying for your hamburger at
<BR>
MacWendKings with money derived from the &quot;employees&quot; at that
<BR>
establishment?
