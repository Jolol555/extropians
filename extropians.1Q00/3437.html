<BR>
<EM> &gt; I get the impression that Billy Brown is talking about post-Singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; entities, while Eugene Leitl is talking about _Nanomedicine_.  These are
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all, I am talking about current technologies, applied to
<BR>
people who will be dying now, and in the near future, and simple
<BR>
biophysics of cryobiology, which are essentially constrained by
<BR>
natural laws. At the patient-receiving end, I'm assuming
<BR>
molecular-resolution quantitative dissassembly and computronium
<BR>
(=ultimative computers made from matter, or a close enough liking to
<BR>
it) plus optimal software to boot, so holding and processing that much
<BR>
data is not a bottleneck. Time constraints are also not an issue,
<BR>
since the system never leaves vitrified state during processing.
<BR>
<P>Alone these assumptions brings the whole discussion out of the realm
<BR>
of science/technology into the technicolor LaLaLand, but I'm cool with
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; radically different levels of technology.  By way of making the point
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (rather than suggesting technologies to bet your life on):
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 1)  I've seen, oh, at least three different proposals for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; femtotechnology, which is to say machines built on the scale of nucleons
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rather than atoms.  Given that kind of 'tech, it would be easy enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; read out the position of every single atom in the frozen brain.
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't the issue. You can achieve atomic resolution (well, that's
<BR>
stretching it not too much, see Shao's NaCl picture) with cryo
<BR>
AFM. This is today's technology:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.people.Virginia.EDU/~js6s/zsfig/figureindex.html">http://www.people.Virginia.EDU/~js6s/zsfig/figureindex.html</A> 
<BR>
<P>I don't see any showstopping reasons why you can't combine imaging
<BR>
with destructive disassembly of kg scale vitrified biological
<BR>
objects. (Again, remember, we engage in absurd optimism here. This is
<BR>
a gedanken, not a scientific discussion. Nano nano uber alles. You've
<BR>
been warned).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 2)  The space of possible human minds is much smaller than the space of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; possible brains.  Given enough intelligence, it would be possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; distinguish plausible reconstructions from implausible ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>I will buy the Omega Point only when I've been personally introduced
<BR>
to him. So far, total persona space is sufficiently large to render
<BR>
total resurrection scenario intractable, even is Someone should be
<BR>
benevolent enough to attempt it (I wouldn't, unless there wasn't
<BR>
anything else worthwhile to do). 10^20 ops Aleph_zero ops are not.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; So yeah, under those circumstances, I think the grain size preserved by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; dropping your head in a bucket of liquid nitrogen contains all the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; relevant information about the brain, as I said before in greater
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; detail.  Whether you can get that information back out using
</EM><BR>
<P>I am the only one that believes that information erasure in course of
<BR>
natural system evolution is possible? Who guarantees you the perfectly
<BR>
reversible Hamiltonian? To go to the mental wanking level (the usual
<BR>
level of discussion when it comes to cryonics), do two quantum states
<BR>
never decay to a single quantum state? So that when you reverse the
<BR>
time you see a bifurcation, which is impossible to resolve without
<BR>
resorting to other information? (Which has been meanwhile carried away 
<BR>
by photons to remote areas of space).
<BR>
<P>Not that these points are relevant in Real Life(tm), it's just a
<BR>
gedanken showing that information erasure _can_ occur. I'm very
<BR>
certain there is lots of information erasure going on in a lot of
<BR>
natural processes, e.g. when you expose extremely anisotropic media to
<BR>
extreme dehydration plus nonlinear compression at extremely high
<BR>
pressures, in a fractal pattern (I need to quantify this, but
<BR>
informally the ice structure obtained via freeze-subst looks like a
<BR>
fractal to me).
<BR>
<P>Reynolds number is simply inapplicable here. This is not a macrosopic
<BR>
homogenous system (that's what some people seem to have between their
<BR>
ears), after all.
<BR>
<P>What I'm saying nobody knows what exactly is going on in there. At gut
<BR>
level, it looks bad, to several people. Future research will tell us,
<BR>
how bad. Echoing Merkle is exactly less than helpful, because I'd
<BR>
rather be a live pessimist then a dead optimist. Does this really make 
<BR>
no sense?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; micron-scale robots following a blind reconstructive pattern is another issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It's worth remembering that the design for a six-degrees-of-freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; manipulator specified in _Nanosystems_ would have been about 4 million
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; atoms in size, while the actual atomic-scale specification worked out by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Drexler seven years later contained only 2,596 atoms(*).  So one might
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; justifiably expect that the devices described in _Nanosystems_ or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; _Nanomedicine_ are the nanotechnological equivalent of vacuum tubes...

<P>I am not talking about the limitations ot future technology here. I
<BR>
thought I made that point very clear, but apparently I haven't.
