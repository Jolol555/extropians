When electric or fuel cell cars (driven by alcohol produced via solarpowered 
<BR>
bacteria) are available there then becomes a huge incentive for the U.S., 
<BR>
Europe, Australia, etc. to move away from oil. At that point it seems there 
<BR>
would be a huge ROI to the people in a country if the governments pushed the 
<BR>
solar cell development hard (through lowcost loans, tax incentives, etc.). 
<BR>
It makes a lot moresense to me for the developed countries to be spending 
<BR>
their &quot;gas&amp;heating&quot; dollars on the installation ofthe infrastructure 
<BR>
required to give them a relatively &quot;free&quot; energy future. It would give me a 
<BR>
huge amount of satisfaction to fill my car up from the ever replenishing 
<BR>
alcohol tank sitting on my roof.

<BR>
<P>This could be a case of the dark side of human nature getting in the way.  
<BR>
How many on this list think the vastly powerful oil companies have lobbied 
<BR>
against or even underhandedly suppressed developing technologies that could 
<BR>
threaten their multi-billion dollar near- monopolies in the western world 
<BR>
and elsewhere?  Remember President Carter trying to change things with the 
<BR>
department of energy that is no longer with us?  Back during WWII the 
<BR>
Germans developed synthetic fuel technology to a high degree!  But we are 
<BR>
not using it.  Considering the U.S. is the breadbasket of the world we could 
<BR>
just &quot;grow&quot; our fuels instead of drill for them.
<BR>
<P>Third-world nations would be smart to try to be more independent by using 
<BR>
the technologies you mention.  But again, the oil companies would wield 
<BR>
their influence to get the leaders of these nations to bend to their will.  
<BR>
It would be nice to see one or two brave leaders in the third-world just say 
<BR>
no, I won't be bought in an effort to stop my nation from not being 
<BR>
completely dependant on big oil.

Its worth noting that for many of the oil producing countries, though this 
<BR>
dampens their revenue stream from depleting natural resources, many of them 
<BR>
are relatively rich in land mass and renewable solar energy. The question 
<BR>
will be whether they build up their educated populations (engineers, etc.) 
<BR>
to levels that are high enough that they can develop technologies that take 
<BR>
advantage of this. Robert

<BR>
<P>I have known people who worked in oil rich Arab nations and said the oil 
<BR>
profits were poorly spent and the infrastructures of these nations are 
<BR>
already frayed around the edges.  I have heard and it may not be true but 
<BR>
people that in these nations do not tend to take advantage of the subsidized 
<BR>
educational opportunities for advanced professional training.  It would be 
<BR>
ironic if we go from middle eastern oil dependance to solar power 
<BR>
dependance!  When the oil runs dry I see things getting very difficult in 
<BR>
Saudi Arabia and elsewhere unless they can live off profits from their 
<BR>
national portfolios.  In the state of Alaska we have our humble permanent 
<BR>
fund. :)
<BR>
<P>In Alaska the oil companies tell the public and government we better &quot;behave 
<BR>
ourselves&quot; or they will start really downsizing here.  When they put out 
<BR>
that vibe it sent a chill through the state.  BP likes to talk about how the 
<BR>
next Alaska will be in the Arab lands formerly under Russian control and 
<BR>
they must gear up for this.
<BR>
<P>I hope one day fuel cells will power our vehicles.  I just hope it is 
<BR>
allowed to happen until every last drop of oil has been drilled on the 
<BR>
planet when there are better alternatives.
<BR>
