<P>
Tempting though this is, I'd hate to be on the wrong end of it.  Being
<BR>
incarcerated based on evidence gained from an illegal search seems an
<BR>
injustice whether the offending officers are reprimanded or not.  What I
<BR>
_would_ like to see is this concept applied to more court-oriented
<BR>
technicalities, improper filings, paperwork, etc.  I would place the
<BR>
violation of suspects' rights on a higher level than a mere
<BR>
technicality, as technicality denotes a small snafu in the workings of
<BR>
the justice system, whereas the violation of rights I would characterize
<BR>
as more of an actual abuse of the system.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this gives rise to some pretty ugly ambiguities.  Is
<BR>
improperly handled DNA evidence a technicality or an abuse?  If we're
<BR>
really very oh-so-sure it's uncontaminated, but the possibility still
<BR>
remains, what now? (Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are instructed
<BR>
to consider the follow evidence as only sort of admissible.)  Perhaps
<BR>
Greg could speak to the question of whether there could be a clear
<BR>
delineation between technicality and abuse?
<BR>
<P>Another idea: though improperly obtained evidence wouldn't be
<BR>
admissible, perhaps it could be accepted as the basis of further
<BR>
investigation, search warrants and the like.  Not that this doesn't give
<BR>
rise to a host of new and exciting problems.
<BR>
<P>The price of freedom is eternal confusion.

<P><P><EM>&gt; I had a similar idea about cops who violated suspects' rights.
</EM><BR>
Instead of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; letting the suspect go free on a technicality, I propose that we go
</EM><BR>
ahead
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and prosecute the suspect in a court of law.  Then we also prosecute
</EM><BR>
the cop
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for violating the suspects' rights.  Two different crimes, and two
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt; trials.  One alleged crime does not influence the judgement of the
</EM><BR>
other.
