That depends, remember that this is in relation to the &quot;multiple-intelligence&quot; thread.  For example, if we take your Car example in light of mike lorrey's arguments then AI is not enough, the car would also require ASA (Aritficial Spatial Ability) as well.

<P><EM>&gt;Symbolic algebra packages can reason fine enough, thank you. And I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't look too forward too much to machines processing verbals, other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than speech input and machine translation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally, I look forward to complete artificial persons (electronic/robotic).  I think it would be a wonderful experience to be able to have a conversation with an entity and not be able to tell whether that entity was strictly organic, electronic, or hybrid.
<BR>
<P><P>I think that the important point between both sides of the &quot;Multiple-Intelligences&quot; argument is, how stable must our language be, and when do we change it.  It is pretty obvious that language requires some stability (Imagine never knowing what a word means, and having dictionaries go obsolete before they even reach press).  However, I would hope that language can serve us as more of a tool than a mere tether.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have much to communicate, often more than physical description alone.  The purpose of my original question is to illustrate that we can find a suitable compromise in just using &quot;mathematical/verbal abstract symbolic reasoning ability&quot; in place of the word intelligence.  We would not dilute the definition of the word intelligence by trying to use it to describe other cognitive abilities, while at the same time affirming the relative importance of those other cognitive abilities.
