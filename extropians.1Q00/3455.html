If we manage to upload, I hope that we are clever enough to
<BR>
simulate not only laughter and joy but also deep sorrow.  Without
<BR>
grief, we might eventually forget how good happiness feels.  {8-]

<P><EM>&gt; Oooh, dipping into the Void, I see. It's a marvelous place of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rejuvenation if you can bear to sit in it and have a tea with your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotions in that place, to just observe and notice what is happening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with yourself, and  not get too... uhmm ... depressed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  I wondered if there might be an explanation for why
<BR>
northern-evolved populations had a higher incidence of SAD if the
<BR>
body temperature dropped slightly during an episode, thereby
<BR>
burning fewer calories during the cold hungry months.  I used
<BR>
one of those basal thermometer thingies that ladies use to determine
<BR>
ovulation and checked it out.  Results: inconclusive.  I had not
<BR>
enough evidence regarding my normal temperature, which
<BR>
I know is a little lower than the ordinary human's.  Further, I
<BR>
did not measure the temperature at the same time each day.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there is an evolutionary advantage to a depression episode
<BR>
if it makes the sufferer less likely to fly into a murderous rage.
<BR>
If a clan were trapped indoors for extended periods under conditions
<BR>
of insufficient mental stimulation, rage might be a problem, however a
<BR>
depressed person might need far less mental stimulation than otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Meta-reasoning:
<BR>
the depression would be a reproductive disadvantage to
<BR>
the individual suffer, but benefit the clan which contained
<BR>
several such individuals.  Eliezer (I think it was) once told me
<BR>
evolution does not work this way, but I do not see why not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've often wondered if men have monthly cycles like those that women
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have. I've observed some behavior in men close to me over the years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that seems like it's possible, or at least their moods seem to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cyclical nature.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldnt be surprised if men's hormone levels change on a
<BR>
regular basis.  The SAD cycle for me is definitely a once a year
<BR>
thing (this year twice).
