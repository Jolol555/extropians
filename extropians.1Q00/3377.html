*smiles* anyone ever read &quot;Flatland&quot;?  What a
<BR>
wonderful book:)
<BR>
Multidimensional spaces are fun to consider... like
<BR>
the thought of a four dimensional being interesecting
<BR>
our three dimensional plane.... expanding suddenly
<BR>
from an infinitesimal point and then receding again...
<BR>
<P>an odd thought I used to think about was how the
<BR>
gravitational force of two particles might affect each
<BR>
other differently in true space then we observed in
<BR>
our curved-space frame...  particles that appear to be
<BR>
farther apart might actually be closer together, and
<BR>
so on... a straight line between point a and point b
<BR>
might be curved, and either point closer together... 
<BR>
it's fun stuff to think about.

<EM>&gt; Subject:	Re: what it's like to be uploaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been thinking about uploading for about thirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years since reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Arthur C. Clarke's book Profiles of the Future-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular the chapter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entitled 'The Obsolescence of Man'. That changed my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perspective completely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (And my 'metaphysics' as well. I learned in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; book to see the world in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms of information patterns, processes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems, instead of substances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and entities.)The only other book in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind-blowing league for me was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eric Drexler's Engines of Creation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero Powers point about communication is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important part of it. Think of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the flow of information inside a brain compared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the meager bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside-words, spoken or written, with a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assist in some regards from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it's clear that government in any sense that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we've known it will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a thing of the past-we don't need ruler nerve cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a brain to function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With this kind of bandwidth we won't need rulers for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Psychology will become a mature science and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering discipline, applied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to making real changes in people. We will certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need that before we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to handle the profound intimacy we have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look forward to. Virtual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality will be an important tool for 'growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenarios': revisiting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past and replacing dysfunctional (or at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-optimal) emotional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns with better choices. The individual will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in charge and will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facilitated in making those changes with nanorobots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adjusting synapses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriately. (My personal name for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology: the Dickens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Facilitator, after Charles Dickens' invention of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three Christmas spirits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who facilitated the transformation of one Ebenezer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scrooge. But there won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be anything spooky about this...or on second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought, maybe there will.) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we will start with relatively superficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adjustments. That should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient to change the general human condition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one described by words
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like self-actuated, happy, loving, benevolent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposeful and rational. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we've learned enough (and with AI to assist, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might not take long) we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might look at modifying the deep architecture of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human mind / brain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First we need to know what it is that we want. We'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successive stages. I think we need to achieve such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable emotional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foundation before we subject it to the strain of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; major augmentations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence and senses. Otherwise I'm afraid to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think what kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychopathy we might unleash in the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of my thoughts about sensory augmentation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; center around the visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense. The farthest out for me has been a notion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that 'objects of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind'-from ideas to music-might exist in a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visual space where they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be 'seen'. I had a kind of spark of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition when I saw Eliezer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yudkowsky's description of the 'codic cortex'. Other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things that have come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mind are higher-dimensional visualization,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transperspective vision and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmetric vision. The latter two essentially would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involve the ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combine things we see separately into seemingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuous wholes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
