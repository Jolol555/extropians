<P><EM>&gt; I don't know you personally Spike but the idea of you being smoldering,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overdone toast does bother me! :)  Confidence is good as long as it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well-placed.  What I like about Mormon theology is that the vast bulk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humanity will be saved in some level of Heaven rather then many ending up in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a nightmarish Hell with a relative few in Heaven.  And also some will go on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to become divine and create worlds of their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course as a Mormon I am on the very real enemies list of evangelicals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I have said before I believe but do not have perfect knowledge and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonics interests me to &quot;see over the horizon&quot; of future events.
</EM><BR>
<P>You know from my prior posts, John, that I have the greatest respect
<BR>
for your Church and your personal belief system.  The question, however,
<BR>
remains as to how one who perceives one's redemption in terms of the
<BR>
restoration of the pristine human and can take an evidently serious interest
<BR>
in a form of human transformation in which the means are quintessentially
<BR>
secular, i.e. technological, and the outcome is an entity that can be
<BR>
called human only by analogy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was fascinated by the thread about Jesus Christ.  I had already read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various views on his historical origins but still found the discussion to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food for thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>I made one post on this subject which may have given the appearance of
<BR>
irreverent indifference.  In fact, the reality was one of irrelevant indifference.
<BR>
One need only study any competent text on comparative religion to learn
<BR>
that the historicity of any founder and the authenticity of various scriptures
<BR>
is an issue for all religions.  One simply cannot weigh the merits of the
<BR>
various spiritualities in terms of verifiable historicity but strictly in terms of
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
