<EM>&gt;   I have the whole FLIR

<EM>&gt;   tape (not just the segments shown in McNulty's videos) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and have watched them extensively. I'll bet that there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is a reason they wanted these tests secret. Amazing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   how CNN is spinning this toward the favor of the FBI 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   (of course): <A HREF="http://cnn.com/2000/US/03/20/waco/index.html">http://cnn.com/2000/US/03/20/waco/index.html</A> 
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if, based on the totality of the FLIR tape, you might be able
<BR>
to answer some of the questions I raised after seeing the Rules of
<BR>
Engagement video:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- All of the gunshots (assuming that is what they are) shown in the video
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appear to be shooting from left to right.  This is the result of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact that the shooters are all on one side of the building, and that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the camera angle is approximately the same for all shots.  In the full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video, are there flashes seen with a significantly different geometry?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, is the airplane ever at the opposite point in its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle above the building, or near that point, when a flash occurs?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- Are there other flashes which are less bright, so that it is harder to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge whether they are just part of the overall &quot;flickering&quot; of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background, versus whether they are gunshots?  If the flashes are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to reflections we'd expect to see a full range of brightness,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from just barely above the background noise level up to the bright
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flashes shown in the video.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- In the script at <A HREF="http://www.mnsinc.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/doc/wre_scr4.html">http://www.mnsinc.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/doc/wre_scr4.html</A>,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;page 38, Allard says, &quot;These are embers that are flying off the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;building, but you can see up in here that this is rapid gunfire. When
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we analyze the tape, we found out that there's two people there in this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;area here. And they're firing for about thirty seconds in this area
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we have the burning dining room area. And it's almost continuous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gunfire. And toward the end of this particular section, we find out
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the people doing the shooting are actually retreating away from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fire and shooting as they're retreating.&quot;  He points with his
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand to the left in the McNulty video to show the direction they are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retreating.  Can you see this effect on your tape, so that the flashes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are actually moving to the left as if the gunmen are retreating?  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part is not shown in the McNulty video.
<BR>
<P>You are the only person I have had contact with who has actually seen the
<BR>
FLIR film so it would be interesting to get your take on these questions.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Hal
