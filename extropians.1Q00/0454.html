<BR>
<EM>&gt; These people worry me;  they are an alliance of extreme nationalist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be coordinating with each other, even when their views clash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Racist groups of various racial backgrounds seem to be working together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despite their mutual distaste for each other.  They are assimilating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Green memes to coordinate with the anti-GM crowd.  They have found a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common enemy--us &amp; all we stand for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Their principles say it all upfront:
</EM><BR>
<P>Perspective needs to be maintained. There are numerous groups that exist
<BR>
under pressure from other groups i.e. Nazis, KKK and Jews and blacks,
<BR>
extreme Pro Life and Pro Choice, etc where periodically there is actual
<BR>
confrontation and violence with a much deeper history and none of them is
<BR>
faced with extinction by their opposite. The adoption of technology and
<BR>
science has been and continues to be the path of global history. I believe
<BR>
it is a good thing for people to think about something new than unthinkingly
<BR>
adopt it. If this process is allowed by the technology's 'cheerleaders' it
<BR>
maybe slower, but will gain far greater and wide spread support. People do
<BR>
not like changing until they are ready (within reason) and they will respond
<BR>
violently if something is being shoved down their throats i.e. 1978 Iranian
<BR>
revolution.
