Thought you would be interested in the DeCSS ruling.
<BR>
Discussion: <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/02/03/143219.shtml">http://slashdot.org/yro/00/02/03/143219.shtml</A>
<BR>
Ruling itself: <A HREF="http://cryptome.org/dvd-mpaa-3-mo.htm">http://cryptome.org/dvd-mpaa-3-mo.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Quoting from the Slashdot intro:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;finds that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (which prohibits
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the publication of computer programs designed to circumvent copy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection) is constitutional&quot;
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;computer source code is not ordinarily a form of expression, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, even if it were, Congress could regulate it in order to serve
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other interests, such as the economic interest of copyright holders&quot;
<BR>
<P>Hmmm, looks like Freedom of Speech is under a fair attack here.
<BR>
Which from my perspective is bad, since the next steps would be
<BR>
prohibiting the publication of a genome sequence that could synthesize
<BR>
THC (or even extend your lifespan...).  It also looks like this ruling
<BR>
is going to run *smack* into the rulings allowing methods and code
<BR>
for encryption *to* be published.  Perhaps you can't publish the
<BR>
DeCSS code, but you can write a book describing in intimate detail
<BR>
how the algorithm works so that any reasonably skilled person can
<BR>
write the code.
<BR>
<P>At any rate, it gets very messy very fast, since the code was
<BR>
originally published in Norway and they don't have a &quot;Digital
<BR>
Millennium Copyright Act&quot;...  Will there be an increase in
<BR>
&quot;rogue&quot; countries around the world that see the advantages
<BR>
for ignoring the copyright regulations of other countries
<BR>
(as Russia and China largely do now)?  [And then how do
<BR>
you cut them off from the net, since encryption allows you
<BR>
to &quot;encrypt&quot; the stuff going over the links out of the
<BR>
country so you have no idea if its email or illegal code...]
<BR>
<P>I still think there are many people who don't understand that
<BR>
the troll isn't content to stay under the bridge any more.
<BR>
<P>As I and others have pointed out, the best model is to produce
<BR>
the &quot;copyrighted works&quot; cheaply enough that it eliminates the
<BR>
incentive to &quot;steal&quot; work.  Related to this is some discussion
<BR>
from Business 2.0:

<P>Got coffee?
