  

 I became aware of the dangers of antidepressants after 

 Littleton gunkid Eric Harris was found to have been on the 

 antidepressant Luvox, prompting me to research the topic.

 I then realized there was probably a good reason why the 

 last words my Mother spoke as the cogent person she was 

 before her sudden decline into dementia were descriptions 

 of the aesthetic qualities of hallucinations that Prozac 

 was causing. Her doctors dismiss any possibility of a link 

 between her dementia and Prozac, yet she had a range of 

 neurotoxic reactions to Prozac and her records show that 

 the onset of her sudden decline was the SAME month that 

 she started taking Prozac! In a matter of months she went 

 from having a 99-percentile IQ to not being sure if people 

 on TV can see you. I wonder if the following study may be 

 shedding light on what Prozac apparently did to my Mother.

 The study found that large doses of SSRIs such as Prozac

 caused some rat brain cells to "shrivel up" in four days!

   Antidepressants Found to Alter Brain Cells in Rats 


   MITCH RUSTAD 

   c.2000 Medical PressCorps News Service 


 <bold>  </bold>A study conducted in animals raises concerns about

   the prolonged use of such commonly prescribed

   antidepressant drugs as fluoxetine (Prozac, Lilly) 

   and sertraline (Zoloft, Pfizer). 


         Researchers found changes in brain cells of rats

   treated with large doses of two antidepressants and

   two anti-obesity drugs. In some cases, the cells

   shriveled up or took on abnormal corkscrew shapes. 


         The study led by Dr. Madhu Kalia, professor 

   of biochemistry, molecular pharmacology,

   anesthesiology and neurosurgery at Jefferson Medical

   College of Thomas Jefferson University in

   Philadelphia, compared the effects of four days of

   high doses of four drugs: fluoxetine, sertraline,

   sibutramine (Meridia, Knoll) and dexfenfluramine

   (Redux), on rat brain cells. Each rat received only

   one drug. The study said that while clinical

   significance of the findings isn't known, there is 

   a need for similar studies of other classes of 

   drugs that act on the central nervous system. 


         After the toxic doses of drugs were halted, 

   and the animals' brains subsequently examined, the

   researchers saw marked changes in some nerve

   terminals that release the neurotransmitter serotonin. 


         ``If any patient who's on any of these drugs, 

   takes the drug in high enough doses for long periods 

   of time, there could be some changes occurring in the

   brain,'' said Kalia. ``There is the potential that this

   could be happening. This study in animals is a red

   flag that perhaps we shouldn't use these drugs with

   reckless abandon.'' 


         These drugs, known collectively as selective

   serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increase the

   level of serotonin, which is vital to brain cell

   communication. Low serotonin levels are linked to

   mood and eating disorders. 


         What do these findings mean? ``We don't know if

   results with four days of drug treatment are clinically

   significant,'' said Kalia. ``We don't know if the cells

   are dying. That's the key question. We need to do

   more studies to prove cell death. These effects may

   be transient and reversible. Or they may be

   permanent.'' The study is published in the March 6

   issue of Brain Research. 


         Serotonin is ubiquitous in the central nervous

   system, making it a frequent target for medications.

   Drugs such as fluoxetine and sertraline raise

   serotonin levels to treat depression and panic attacks.

   Another class of SSRIs, anti-anorexics used for

   weight loss, includes sibutramine and

   dexfenfluramine (withdrawn from the market in 1997

   after being linked to heart-valve problems). Such

   drugs block circulating serotonin. After brain cells

   use serotonin, it is recycled in the brain. SSRIs keep

   serotonin from being recirculated back to the brain

   for subsequent use, allowing the chemical to stay

   active in the brain. 


         More than a decade ago, rat studies showed that

   high doses of dexfenfluramine could change the shape

   of some brain terminals, said Kalia. Some

   researchers attributed the effect to the fact that the

   drug was also a serotonin releaser. 


         ``It was a big mystery why with high doses these

   brain terminals looked like corkscrews,'' said Kalia.

   ``We asked the question, 'Would other SSRIs cause

   the same effects in high doses?''' 


         With some patients using some of these drugs for

   long periods of time, and with scientists unsure of the

   long-term effects of many of these drugs, Kalia and

   her colleagues plan to do long-term studies in

   animals. 


         ``We will lower the doses to about 10 to 30 times

   the therapeutic dose and give it to the rats for six

   months to a year,'' said Kalia. ``We will examine the

   rats at selected time periods to see if these changes

   occur in serotonin cells over the long term, or if the

   brain adjusts,'' she continued. The researchers would

   then look for behavioral and neurological effects of

   any brain changes. 


         ``We need to find out if these changes are

   effecting behavioral changes in the rat and in

   patients,'' said Kalia.

We compared the effects of treatment with high doses of 

fluoxetine, sibutramine, sertraline, and dexfenfluramine 

for 4 days on brain serotonergic nerve terminals in rats.

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine

(5,7-DHT) were used as positive controls because both compounds 

deplete brain serotonin. Food intake and body weight changes 

were also monitored and yoked, pair-fed animals were used to 

control for possible changes in morphology due to nutritional 

deficits. Fluoxetine, sibutramine, sertraline and dexfenfluramine 

all produced a significant reduction in body weight. Fluoxetine, 

sibutramine and sertraline treatment resulted in no depletion of 

brain serotonin but produced morphological abnormalities in the 

serotonergic immunoreactive nerve network. In contrast, 

dexfenfluramine and MDMA depleted brain serotonin and 

produced morphological changes in the serotonin nerve 

network. These results indicate that even though fluoxetine, 

sibutramine and sertraline do not deplete brain serotonin, 

they do produce morphological changes in several brain 

regions (as identified by serotonin immunohistochemistry). 

Dexfenfluramine and MDMA, on the other hand, markedly deplete 

brain serotonin and also produce morphological changes. 

Collectively, these results lend support to the concept that 

all compounds acting on brain serotonin systems, whether 

capable of producing serotonin depletion or not, could 

produce similar effects on the morphology of cerebral 

serotonin systems.
