The first loosening of the chastity belt that bound my curiosity, I owe
<BR>
to an encounter with Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, in the 70's, as
<BR>
I've posted before.  Twelve years ago, I began backing away from
<BR>
Christianity all together.  So I am twelve years old, out of the Lord
<BR>
;-D.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, it is still easy for me to expect that there is
<BR>
intelligent, benevolent, occasional intervention in our lives.  I find
<BR>
comfort in expecting a more evolved intelligence to know, and be pleased
<BR>
with my personal motivations.  I enjoy expressing gratitude, mentally
<BR>
(prayer?) and frequently to anyone who a) might be listening and b)
<BR>
might have something to do with the inordinate number of lotteries I've
<BR>
won in this life.
<BR>
<P>I am bothered by the flip side of thanking &quot;whatever&quot; for my good
<BR>
fortune.  Is that not a) saying thanks for treating me better than the
<BR>
other guy, implying that whatever has favorites, or b) that perhaps
<BR>
whatever is not in complete control, or c) I deserve better than the
<BR>
other guy.
<BR>
<P>I expect that, if there is intelligent intervention, it is not
<BR>
omnipotent.  I think what we observe is a work in progress.  Suffering
<BR>
is a natural product of our evolution.  
<BR>
<P>2 questions for discussion:  If pain and suffering did not exist, might
<BR>
complacency keep us from creating?  Secondly, HOW MUCH pain and
<BR>
suffering would be the minimum that an intelligent species would need,
<BR>
to be motivated to create?

<EM>&gt; &quot;Given the total indifference to human suffering displayed by the almighty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `playing God' involves twiddling one's thumbs while millions die in extreme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agony from horrible diseases.  All this `putting an end to human

<EM>&gt; suffering'is surely the work of the devil.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have pondered over this many times, myself.  As a believer it bothers me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more then it might an atheist.  A Mormon apologist might say that even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long lifespan is a blink of an eye to God.  We will look back on things in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the next life and remember our suffering as learning experiences and be even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more grateful for a glorious and perfected resurrected body to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eternity in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mormons believe that a big part of the test in this life is the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horrendous fact that life is so unfair.  It is what we each make of what we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have and whether we get bitter toward God or have faith and do our best to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve our lot and that of others around us, that is the big challenge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Religious belief has motivated many people through history to reach out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to help others, sometimes dedicating whole lives to this, even though it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meant poverty and a shortened life.  Could this be God's way of reaching out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to help ease the suffering?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So much of what I see in the world enrages me.  When I study history I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horrified by all the ignorance, poverty, war and disease that devastated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; families and nations.  Some of it people knowingly brought upon themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but much of it was out of their control.  And right as of this moment in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, to a great extent these evils still exist and inflict grievous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering on countless millions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The petty things may actually bother me the most.  The way life is so unfair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a relative few being considered &quot;physically attractive&quot; and getting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention.  I go occasionally to church dances where I see the plain looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; girls being ignored.  I dance with them but sometimes feel self-conscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it.  And the people who ignore them are supposed to be such fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christ-centered folks.  I see evolutionary psychology in action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wish I had all the answers, which I don't.  We have brains which allow us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to learn and master the world around us and we must do it to make this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet a better place for human beings to live.  I think this is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatest gift we have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sincerely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
