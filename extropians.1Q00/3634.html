<P>Heh heh. Recently I've been getting into this ant stuff - I wrote a
<BR>
little simulator for Linux/OpenGL and called it emergAnt... It works
<BR>
somewhat, but there are an enormous number of very sensitive
<BR>
parameters: pheromone decay rate, sniff angle and distance, how random
<BR>
a walk off a path is, etc. It's a very simple idea, but getting good
<BR>
results turns out to be much trickier than I imagined. Using some
<BR>
evolutionary model to find the ideal configuration seems like it would
<BR>
work pretty well - each nest produces a queen when it stacks up enough
<BR>
food, who then goes off and founds a colony with slightly wobbled
<BR>
numbers. The search space isn't that big and I'd guess it's pretty
<BR>
susceptible to that kind of hill climbing. I'd also like to model
<BR>
warrior ants - they would attack workers from rival colonies,
<BR>
releasing clouds of war scent to attract their friends, etc. It would
<BR>
make a terrific screen saver.
<BR>
<P>Alas, my attention span is short and I started fiddling with something
<BR>
else.
