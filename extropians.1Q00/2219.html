<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman Sow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Incredible movie. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     You mean you haven't got a DVD player yet?  Oh Randy get with the times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;video is sooooo 2nd Millennium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I forget who came up with that line but I thought it was priceless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     That is a great movie though isn't it.  As far as acting, Carrey blew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Truman away when he played Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt;When Truman came up against the wall at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I can relate to that too.  Very often when people bring up the topic of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death, I will inevitably mention that death &quot;may&quot; not be inevitable.  When I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to explain that it is really just a problem with biology and it can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corrected, I usually get a look as if I just tore off my face and reveled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some terrifying Sci Fi creature.  I never understood why this should come as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a shock to people these days.  As a species human kind has been searching for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the answer to immortality from the moment we realized that we are alive.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been searching for answers and now we are coming up with answers that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't involve having to die to get there.  Seems to me that there should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less &quot;faith&quot; involved in physical immortality than the leap of faith or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gamble that there may be a spiritual after life involving a transference into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another dimension, an alternate reality or even an unseen UFO in the tail of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a comet.  To me these are no longer valid options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Then there is the old why would anyone want to live forever refrain. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone truly does not care if they die than they are not really living to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;begin with.  Ask the same person if they would be willing to die tomorrow and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the answer is almost always &quot;no&quot;.  It should be obvious... That is the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point!  Perhaps it's just another step in evolution or natures way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choosing it's Immortals.
</EM><BR>
