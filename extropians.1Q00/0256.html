Interesting to see someone as establishment as Safire getting the idea.

<P>ESSAY / By WILLIAM SAFIRE
<BR>
<P>Why Die?
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON -- Of all the instincts in animals, the strongest
<BR>
is the will to survive. In the human animal, that inborn
<BR>
defense is sometimes overcome by the maternal instinct,
<BR>
by love of country or comrades in battle, or by an illness like
<BR>
depression. But in most of us, nothing makes the weak strong or
<BR>
the fearful brave as much as our bodies' innate drive to stay alive. 
<BR>
<P>Because of that survival instinct, in the millennium to come a
<BR>
curious question will occupy the minds of our descendants. It
<BR>
seems almost nutty to ask it today, but tomorrow's question will be:
<BR>
Why die? 
<BR>
<P>One sober-sided school of scientific thought holds that Homo
<BR>
sapiens sapiens, our species now celebrating its 100th millennium,
<BR>
is born with an inner clock. That genetic clock directs our cells not
<BR>
only to grow but to age and decay. It is set to run no more than 120
<BR>
or 130 years. 
<BR>
<P>Few of us live to that full span because of illness, accident or war.
<BR>
But the clear trend is toward filling up more of that span: in the past
<BR>
century alone, life expectancy in the U.S. has gone from 46 to 76.
<BR>
Now add the ingredient of diseaselessness: conservative scientists
<BR>
say that in the coming century cures will be found for the leading
<BR>
killers -- heart disease, cancer and stroke -- and genetically
<BR>
influenced diseases will be engineered out of existence. 
<BR>
<P>With the major killers gone, and with organ transplants or prosthetic
<BR>
innards replacing worn-out human parts, more people will be
<BR>
pushing up against that presumed clock. Centenarians will be
<BR>
common. 
<BR>
<P>Now take the leap: What if the hypothesis of the clock-watchers is
<BR>
mistaken? As the lengthening of life in the 20th century showed us,
<BR>
a life span of &quot;three score and ten&quot; is not the most reliable prediction
<BR>
in the Bible. Where is it written in our genes that a signal will direct
<BR>
our bodies to close up shop at 120? 
<BR>
<P>I put that question to the great Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Dr. Guy
<BR>
McKhann. He and his wife, Prof. Marilyn Albert, the new head of the
<BR>
Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute in Boston, are completing
<BR>
a book about the untapped potential of the aging brain. (They are
<BR>
&quot;experts on aging&quot;; never call them &quot;aging experts.&quot;) 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Maybe you're asking the wrong question,&quot; says Dr. McKhann.
<BR>
&quot;Assume there is some finite span of time set by an internal clock,
<BR>
as studies of other species suggest. Then the real question
<BR>
becomes: Can we reset the clock?&quot; 
<BR>
<P>That's what all the recent excitement among scientists over stem
<BR>
cells is about. If the next-to-last year of the second millennium is
<BR>
remembered for anything, it will be for the discovery of the human
<BR>
body's ability to regenerate itself. 
<BR>
<P>These stem cells -- non-differentiated globs of cells that divide
<BR>
randomly and blossom into nerve or muscle or brain cells -- are
<BR>
being shown to be a source of replacement of dead or dying cells.
<BR>
We never thought that to be possible. These wild-card cells may be
<BR>
found not just in embryos but in adult bodies, and could, in effect,
<BR>
reset the clock -- time and again, doubling and redoubling the life
<BR>
span. Ponce de León's fountain of youth may be within our reach. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Some organs, like the liver, will be relatively easy to regenerate,&quot;
<BR>
says Dr. McKhann. &quot;The brain is harder, but we should be able to
<BR>
replace parts of the brain afflicted with diseases, as well as to
<BR>
improve short- and long-term memory in the renewing brain.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>At a millennium's turn, we can think even bigger. If the instinct for
<BR>
survival remains paramount, most of the geezers of the next few
<BR>
hundred years will want to stick around. At first, that seems
<BR>
troubling; as the Ira Gershwin lyric observed: &quot;Methusaleh lived 900
<BR>
years. / But who calls dat livin' / when no gal'll give in / to no man
<BR>
what's 900 years?&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Answer: For future people, doddering will no longer be an option.
<BR>
Throw out those second-millennium images of codgers in
<BR>
wheelchairs staring at the wall. The Gramps of a century or so from
<BR>
now will be swiveling on the dance floor with his replacement hips
<BR>
and fresh lungs and newly enlivened brain and pocketful of potency
<BR>
pills. 
<BR>
<P>Granted, as mortality recedes and babies keep coming, it could get
<BR>
a little crowded here. After the population of earth reaches 30 billion,
<BR>
what then? Solution: Start shipping the spry old folks out on a
<BR>
mission to colonize the solar system. &quot;Happy 200th birthday,
<BR>
Grandma -- here's your ticket to Mars, and say hello to your parents
<BR>
out there.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>This calendar-induced speculation is not directed at those of us
<BR>
today who will probably keel over even before our genetic clocks run
<BR>
out. But for those readers of a distant tomorrow who will flip back
<BR>
through the millennia to access The New York Times Archive, one
<BR>
will say, &quot;You know, this fellow was incredibly prescient.&quot; And
<BR>
another will respond, with all human skepticism, &quot;Sure, he was right
<BR>
-- but do you really want to live forever?&quot; 
<BR>
