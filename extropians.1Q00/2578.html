Aw, I was gonna beat him to it! Ding BLANG IT TO BLAZES! Pardon me while
<BR>
I subvert this thread to take some time off.
<BR>
<P>Is it OK if I shout as long as I'm only shouting pretend-naughty stupid
<BR>
words?
<BR>
<P>Strike that last. I'm a mehum, so by definition my output can only be
<BR>
stupid. 
<BR>
<P>I don't think anyone is being a coward. I will note that my preference
<BR>
for a maximum of elbow room just felt something like a sharp twinge. And
<BR>
because I refuse to waste my attention trying to model what a minor's
<BR>
worst-case parents would find offensive when I post--I refuse, I will
<BR>
not waste the energy to think about it, though it may turn up in my
<BR>
thoughts eventually--and so, inevitably, someday, I will post something
<BR>
with a stronger sentiment or language than, perhaps, &quot;Oh Perdition!&quot;, or
<BR>
perhaps something more earthily verifiable and Indo-Euro, such as to be
<BR>
unmistakably inappropriate to others of some different calibration.
<BR>
<P>Well, I can't stand the thought of being the person to be hanged with
<BR>
the label of The Guy Who Got Extropy's Ass Sued.
<BR>
<P>Ooops. There I go. 
<BR>
<P>And here I go. Because I respect Eliezer too much to disagree with him
<BR>
(and Robert--incidentally, I'm not a lawyer but I think the response to
<BR>
the question you posed is usually, &quot;If you have to think more than once
<BR>
about it, you probably *should* be preparing a legal defense fund. Or
<BR>
getting insurance. If you're judgement-proof, what the heck?&quot;).
<BR>
<P>It's been another interesting chunk of time, all. Be well. See you on
<BR>
the Funway. I hadn't thought this was Disney dot &quot;freaking&quot; com.
<BR>
<P>When I stop caring about this enough, I'll probably be back. And I'll be
<BR>
myself, too, the kind that doesn't want to spend time in this particular
<BR>
minefield right now. But it'll be later, so maybe I'll be different. Or
<BR>
not. And I'm sorry that I can't think of a way to distinguish my
<BR>
reaction from simple pigheadedness. That's really too bad.
<BR>
<P>Mike
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'm just looking for an excuse. In that case, I'll excuse myself.
<BR>
Wonderful pie, Mrs. Cleaver. OOLP! there I go.
