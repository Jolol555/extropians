One of the big problems here is &quot;is air free&quot;? The most compact energy
<BR>
density ratings will come from things that react with air (the rusting
<BR>
nail, other combustion, etc.) If you don't weigh the air, and there's
<BR>
always plenty of it, you are talking about something that puts
<BR>
self-contained systems like batteries at a disadvantage. That might be
<BR>
OK for your system, or it might not.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is a much more complicated question than it looks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah. Actually I knew that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer different if we look at joules per mililiter instead of per gram?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course.  If volume doesnt matter, hydrogen and flourine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pack a tremendous bang per gram.  Solid rocket fuels are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way down on specific impulse per unit weight, but they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exceed liquid rocket impulse as a function of volume.  Furthermore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the answer depends on how you want to actually *use* the energy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For instance, a hand grenade has less chemical energy than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a twinky.  If you are interested in converting energy via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; internal combustion, good old octane is quite respectable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as energy released, a rusting piece of iron does well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you are imagining chemical storage for nanoconstruction,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mitochondria have found a good energy transfer medium,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the breakdown of simple sugars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Please sharpen the question Stirling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, I am working on a chemical model for futuristic role-playing purposes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I am trying to find out (in my naive way) is what is the maximum amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy you can get from a chemical reaction. Any reaction. It doesn't matter if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it takes a billion years to react, or if the energy is produced by expanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gasses (such as gunpowder) or by heat from simple combustion (as in octane).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea is to get an upper bound on the theoretically achievable, and to then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt to express different classes of chemical reaction as percentages of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achievable.  So, if the most energetic reaction produces some X j/g then we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might say that the theoretical maximal gunpower produces kX j/g where k is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characteristic of that mode of chemical reaction. By the same token, we end up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with factors k1, k2, k3 and so on for theoretical most caloric food, best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rocket propelant, and electricity-producing reaction. I would then attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate where we stood by doing some research in various newsgroups (including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this one, naturally) to get candidates for our best current tech in each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; category. If I can get a coherent enough picture, I can build a tech-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model for chemical technology.
