<EM>&gt; Using a comment by Robert as a departure onto a new thread,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wish to ask a question I and my friends have been pondering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for some time:  How do we teach children born in the 90s values
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriate to their times?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ye gods, good question.
<BR>
<P>I think the key concept to teach the children of today is that of
<BR>
change.  Its power, its importance, and particularly its inevitability.
<BR>
We've seen how much opposition is created to a new idea, not out of
<BR>
concern for the merit or danger of an idea, but merely from the fact
<BR>
that it threatens a well-entrenched worldview.  It seems we ought to be
<BR>
teaching children to be expecting change, and to be able to modify or
<BR>
even discard their worldview if the situation warrants it.  In this, it
<BR>
seems we shouldn't be teaching our children so much as directing them.
<BR>
Child-rearing seems to be so much defining of how the world works, and
<BR>
when the world works differently five years later, the worldview
<BR>
conflicts with reality.  I would think we might have more success
<BR>
teaching them how to deal effectively with the world, in whatever
<BR>
iteration, rather than simply explaining the rules.  The whole
<BR>
conception vs. equation idea, where conception can take one farther in
<BR>
dealing with a problem than the mere descriptive equations.
<BR>
<P>And Sesame Street.  Lots of it.
