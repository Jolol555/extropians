Wait, now I further realize that this point may have already been achieved 
<BR>
for those who are under 10 yrs now, and that life extension techniques will 
<BR>
likely be less effective for those already aged. This has surely already 
<BR>
been hashed out, I just missed it somehow.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>In the issue of &quot;Wired&quot; with the &quot;future gets to be fun again&quot; theme they 
<BR>
had a chart on this entitled, &quot;Immortality Reality Check&quot;, though it was 
<BR>
ridiculed by some list members.  I do agree with the general idea of it that 
<BR>
those born another twenty years down the line will undoubtedly as a 
<BR>
generation make it to the finish line of emortality.  I have my doubts about 
<BR>
those currently alive being so fortunate.  I would like to be proven wrong 
<BR>
on this.

Yep. I'd bet its been reached for most people under 30. Its those of us in 
<BR>
our 40's who are on the edge while those in their 50's and up have to look 
<BR>
at cryonics or accelerating the singularity onset.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Well, it looks like the old fogies on the list better donate money when Saul 
<BR>
Kent has Charles Platt down the road lead the effort to raise money for 
<BR>
research into improved techniques for brain suspension.  Time's a wastin'!
<BR>
<P>Or else donate money to Eliezer's infant Singularity Institute so he can 
<BR>
bring on the singularity earlier.  But I perceive his rush toward the 
<BR>
singularity as risking a T2 scenario and so I will go for cryonics! :)

<BR>
<P>Wow!!  So, if we are still around in decent health thirty years from now we 
<BR>
will have crossed the emortality finish line??  Please give much more 
<BR>
information.  I would say a genegineered ten-year old in 2030 would be 
<BR>
positioned to make it for more then a young teen today(sorry Neal and 
<BR>
Ziana!).

Now then, we can reach this point and still not be immortal, because even if 
<BR>
our risk of death is going down with time,it is nonzero, so we are still 
<BR>
accumulating risk.  I know not this topic, but I am confident this has 
<BR>
already been thought out and thoroughly documented. But where?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>There was a cryonicist (I cannot remember who) that used life insurance 
<BR>
statistics to show that even if you were emortal, you would eventually be 
<BR>
killed by some physical trauma(accident of some kind more likely then 
<BR>
murder) before your fifteen hundredth birthday!!  That still is a long time 
<BR>
to live!
<BR>
<P>And of course in a society of immortals, you would most likely have 
<BR>
everything from transportation to food made safer to improve those odds.  
<BR>
This would be good as long as we don't wind up utterly obsessed about it 
<BR>
like the alien race in &quot;Ringworld&quot; known as the puppeteers.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I hope the &quot;Immortality Reality Check&quot; section that was in &quot;Wired&quot;  
<BR>
ends up being wrong.  Perhaps breakthroughs will come quickly enough that we 
<BR>
will beat the odds.  Considering all the argument over cryonics, I hope so.
<BR>
