<EM>&gt; &gt; I think, however, the best solutions to this &quot;who watches the watchers&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem are 1) to reduce the overall power of government so that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; chances for corrupt or wrong behavior are lower...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...and its consequences less severe..
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily.  Penalties for breaking the law can still be severe; there
<BR>
will just be less intrusion of the government into every aspect of life.
<BR>
Modern governments tend to regulate almost everything we do.  Surely, a lot
<BR>
of these laws are unenforced, but they still exist and selective
<BR>
enforcement, in itself, is one form corruption takes.  E.g., the mayor in
<BR>
your city doesn't like you and you are an outspoken critic of him and own a
<BR>
business in town and the various inspectors visit you very often.  (I used
<BR>
this example because it really happened to a friend of mine in Perth Amboy,
<BR>
NJ several years ago.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2) to spread the ideals of a free and rational culture so that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people don't tolerate governmental abuses of power...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reducing the size/power of government also makes this easier, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it makes it harder for the government to out-propagandize the private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broadcasters and private educators.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds to me like someone would rather wait in a soup line in the old Soviet
<BR>
Union than shop around in a free economy.:)  But seriously, I don't
<BR>
understand what Lee Daniel is getting at here.  Please elaborate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's also Brin's solution #3: &quot;Who watches the watchers? Everyone.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is a ridiculous statement, since we _already_ have that.  (If Brin
<BR>
really said this, then he's lost some big points in my rating of him.:)  We
<BR>
can, in most countries, vote the current elite out of power and whoever we
<BR>
elect can clean house at the various police departments.  However, this does
<BR>
not happen.  Why?  Because each voter (Brin's &quot;everyone&quot;) has little
<BR>
incentive to investigate (&quot;watch the watchers&quot;) these matters or follow
<BR>
through with political (electoral or protest) or legal (filing lawsuits,
<BR>
etc.) actions.
<BR>
<P>If you've (and I'm using the &quot;you&quot; here in the plural sense -- not singling
<BR>
out Lee Daniel here:) ever been involved in these matters, you would know
<BR>
how difficult it is to proceed along these lines.  I've been involved in a
<BR>
few such actions.  They are very costly.  If you have to sit in court or
<BR>
protest or campaign, it's very high cost.  Corrupt or bad police officers do
<BR>
not face the same costs.  After all, going to court is usually part of their
<BR>
job and the court is often, sadly, on their side.
