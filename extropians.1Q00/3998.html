<P>
The way the Freenet system is designed to work, a given document may be
<BR>
stored on one or more server nodes.  Each node stores a certain number
<BR>
of documents, ranked by priority.  When a document is fetched, its
<BR>
rank is increased and that of all others is lowered.  When documents'
<BR>
rankings drop below a certain level, they are deleted from the node,
<BR>
although pointers are kept to other nodes where they may still be present.
<BR>
<P>This produces a sort of crude &quot;economy&quot;, where document requests are
<BR>
treated like payment to keep documents present in the system.  Documents
<BR>
which are requested more often get higher rankings and get replicated on
<BR>
multiple servers.  Documents which are requested too rarely eventually
<BR>
get dropped from the system.
<BR>
<P>The problem with this kind of system is that there is no method for
<BR>
effectively determining the demand for a piece of information.  In terms
<BR>
of the &quot;economy&quot;, document requests are too crude to serve as currency
<BR>
because they are too easily &quot;forged&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In the other direction, the system attempts to offer publishing services
<BR>
to anyone, without regard for ability to pay.  It is in effect a pure
<BR>
commons, and since there are no costs to publishers, we can expect that
<BR>
the resource will be over-utilized.
<BR>
<P>So we are likely to see documents flooded into the system, both by
<BR>
people trying to wash out the ones they don't like, and by genuine
<BR>
users attracted by the free service.  People will create request bots
<BR>
and cooperative circles in order to keep their documents present (and
<BR>
to flush the ones they don't like out of the system).
<BR>
<P>It's a highly unbalanced and fragile system which is unlikely to achieve
<BR>
much robustness.
<BR>
<P>However it could still be a good testbed for the basic mechanisms for
<BR>
storing documents, moving them around, and so on.  If the ranking system
<BR>
were updated to be more reasonable (based on real payments, for example)
<BR>
then it could grow into a more stable system.
