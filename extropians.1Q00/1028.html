<EM> &gt;Now, it seems likely within the next 10-20 years, that we will have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;artificial wombs.  So the whole &quot;growing babies&quot;/motherhood concept
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;gets separated from the putting sperm and eggs together to make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;a potential human being.  When will we get to the point where
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;people view this like manufacturing a car? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Women's bodies are changed
<BR>
&nbsp;drastically by that clump of cells, and their minds, and their emotions,
<BR>
&nbsp;especially given 15 or 20 or 50 years of profound personal immersion in a
<BR>
&nbsp;(largely women's) culture of nurturance. Even women who go through the pain
<BR>
&nbsp;and anxiety of in vitro conception (and I've known one at least and seen
<BR>
&nbsp;others interviewed) don't and perhaps can't regard the process as if it
<BR>
&nbsp;were building a car. Ach! 
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Why the sacred cow?
<BR>
I think artificial wombs *might* make having babies much less of an ordeal, 
<BR>
and a large percentage of women would opt for it, if only avoid pain, and to 
<BR>
preserve their bodys elastins...  er um... vanity... 
<BR>
<P>plus making it possible for people to have babies that previously could not!
<BR>
<P>Almost every sci-fi novel I've read about bio-tech has an artificial womb 
<BR>
scenario.
<BR>
Apart from allowing women to relax a little, it also changes the nature of 
<BR>
breeding and sex. 
<BR>
<P>Sex itself not being the act of conception, it loses or gains momentum?
