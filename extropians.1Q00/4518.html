Scientists Map Pattern of Growth in Young Brains
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt; Learning: Computer imaging shows changes coinciding with mental
<BR>
leaps. Findings could guide teaching methods.

<BR>
Opening a new window into the mental mysteries of youth, researchers at UCLA
<BR>
for the first time have directly mapped growing human brains, revealing a
<BR>
cascade of unsuspected physical changes.
<BR>
The scientists recorded neural growth spurts that coincide with important
<BR>
leaps in early learning ability.
<BR>
The findings, made public today in the journal Nature, may help lay the
<BR>
foundations for a reassessment of how best to teach language, mathematics
<BR>
and other crucial mental skills.
<BR>
Every human brain, the researchers determined, experiences rapid, distinct
<BR>
waves of almost explosive growth that may determine when it is physically
<BR>
most receptive to learning new skills or ways of thinking. These growth
<BR>
spurts occur when the fledgling mental organ is virtually bursting with
<BR>
vitality--twice as energetic as an adult brain.
<BR>
&quot;This is potentially a very important discovery,&quot; said brain imaging expert
<BR>
Joy Hirsch at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who has
<BR>
been studying brain development in infants.
<BR>
Until recently, little was known about how normal human brains change as
<BR>
they grow because conventional medical imaging techniques, such as
<BR>
computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) were too
<BR>
dangerous, invasive or uncomfortable for healthy children. Traditional
<BR>
autopsy studies revealed almost nothing about neural growth in the young.
<BR>
Educators have long known that intellectual abilities in language, music and
<BR>
mathematics must be developed before puberty. They speculated that there are
<BR>
critical periods when the brain is most open to learning such skills.
<BR>
But until now they could only guess at the transformations in brain anatomy
<BR>
that were involved.
<BR>
&quot;Our biggest surprise was how much the brain is changing,&quot; said Jay Gieddes,
<BR>
chief of brain imaging at the National Institute of Mental Health child
<BR>
psychiatry branch, who helped perform the study. &quot;It is much more
<BR>
tumultuous, much more dynamic, much busier than we ever guessed.&quot;
<BR>
To map the changing structure of the developing brain, scientists at UCLA's
<BR>
neuro-imaging laboratory invented a technique that allows them to precisely
<BR>
track millions of physical landmarks in the growing brain, keeping it in
<BR>
focus as it morphs into new shapes over the childhood years.
<BR>
The technique harnesses conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which
<BR>
can take detailed, three-dimensional anatomical images of living brain
<BR>
tissue, to the power of a graphics supercomputer and three dozen computer
<BR>
workstations. The end result is a neural journey through time that allows
<BR>
researchers to track three-dimensional changes in an individual from one
<BR>
year to the next with a precision never before possible.
<BR>
&quot;You are looking at a very sensitive measure of how the brain is changing
<BR>
and how rapidly it is changing,&quot; said UCLA neurologist Arthur W. Toga,
<BR>
director of the neuro-imaging laboratory and the senior researcher
<BR>
overseeing the study.
<BR>
<P>A Fingerprint of the Brain
<BR>
In all, the team followed half a dozen children between the ages of 3 and
<BR>
15, imaging them repeatedly over the years to create a unique fingerprint of
<BR>
their maturing brains. The children were scanned at intervals ranging from
<BR>
two weeks to four years.
<BR>
Much of the most intense growth was concentrated in a bundle of nerve tissue
<BR>
called the corpus callosum, which serves as the central communications
<BR>
conduit between the hemispheres of the brain.
<BR>
In the youngest children studied--between 3 and 6--the researchers
<BR>
discovered extremely rapid growth spurts in brain regions responsible for
<BR>
learning new skills and for learning to think ahead. The scans showed peak
<BR>
growth rates in frontal circuits of the brain that help focus attention,
<BR>
maintain alertness and plan new actions.
<BR>
&quot;In the very youngest children, there really is this furious growth going on
<BR>
in the frontal circuits of the brain,&quot; said UCLA neurologist Paul Thompson,
<BR>
who helped develop the mapping technique. &quot;You see this extraordinary wave
<BR>
of peak growth that proceeds from the front of the brain to the back.&quot;
<BR>
Among the youngest children, these communications lines grew fastest where
<BR>
they are linked to the frontal cortex. &quot;Those are areas that would handle
<BR>
the learning of new behaviors, the planning of new actions, the overall
<BR>
organization of new skills,&quot; he said.
<BR>
There also were bursts of growth among these fibers leading to crucial
<BR>
language areas at the same time.
<BR>
The researchers found that growth rates in an area of the brain linked to
<BR>
language were slow between the ages of 3 and 6 but speeded up from 7 to 15
<BR>
years, when children normally fine-tune language skills. The intense growth
<BR>
in language areas then dropped off abruptly at puberty, coinciding with the
<BR>
end of a well-known critical period for language learning.
<BR>
Older children, between 7 and 13, also experienced an equally intense
<BR>
buildup of neural circuits in regions that handle mathematical thinking and
<BR>
the understanding of spatial relationships.
<BR>
&quot;These investigators have discovered some structural patterns that have
<BR>
important consequences,&quot; Hirsch said. &quot;They are finding growth patterns in
<BR>
specific [neural] structures that are coming and going with age&quot; that may
<BR>
have a profound impact on the pace of mental development.

Mapping Mental Growth
<BR>
These images show how the human brain changes through childhood. A better
<BR>
understanding of such changes could shape the future of education by showing
<BR>
when the brain is physically most receptive to learning. These images
<BR>
combine scans taken over a period of four years, with the areas of most
<BR>
intense growth in red, showing growth in regions that handle language,
<BR>
mathematical thinking and spatial relationships. Areas with the least growth
<BR>
are in blue.
