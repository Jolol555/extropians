<EM>&gt; &gt; There's also the question of whether the indiginous population would

<EM>&gt; &gt; welcome the reinstatement of imperialist external rule.  Most of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; countries worked hard to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Economically many countries are worse off, but it would be a terrible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blow to their pride to ask for the hated rulers to come back in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; start running things again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have an apartment house that you aren't managing well, you can hire a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; management company to do it for you.  There are cities that contract out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ambulance services, garbage collection, and even fire fighting services, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order to save money.  Why not contract out the entire government to a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporation who could manage the country professionally?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this idea caught on, then corporations would have to compete against each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other to win bids.  If countries adopted this idea, government would be reduced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the boring task of keeping the streets clean, and making the trains run on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.
</EM><BR>
<P>An interesting idea, but how would you keep these new governments from
<BR>
passing laws that lock out all competitors, to prevent replacement in
<BR>
case they themselves become corrupt (or were corrupt all along)?  If the
<BR>
governments are restricted from passing laws...well, nobody's perfect
<BR>
(yet), and neither are any existing set of laws, so who gets to debug
<BR>
whatever legal system people come up with as the flaws are found?
<BR>
<P>Although, come to think of it, electing the corporation that will
<BR>
provide government services, with a few things (equivalent to US
<BR>
Constitution) unchangeable by these corporations alone, might have some
<BR>
possibilities.  Perhaps restrict the corporations to public services
<BR>
(like public transit and street cleaning), including law enforcement
<BR>
(where the corporations are voted on by the people directly, *not* just
<BR>
by representatives, so anyone who tries to get too oppressive gets voted
<BR>
out; the military would still be the government's own, partly to act as
<BR>
a counter in case law enforcement tried to harrass voters).  Also forbid
<BR>
the rest of the government's members from having any financial stake in
<BR>
the corporations vying to provide these services.
<BR>
<P>The objective, of course, would be to induce &quot;Western&quot;, possibly
<BR>
&quot;American&quot; or &quot;European&quot; (these being the labels that detractors would
<BR>
probably eventually use), style respect for and use of civil
<BR>
institutions.  If, for example, the President of the United States were
<BR>
to order his armed forces to impose martial law on their entire country
<BR>
at this instant, said forces would be more likely to (technically)
<BR>
mutiny and arrest him instead, because that's not anything like how most
<BR>
of them believe the country should be run.  Equivalent reaction in the
<BR>
African countries in question: &quot;Sir?  The country already *is* under
<BR>
martial law.  We ain't never removing it.&quot;  The most significant
<BR>
difference?  Attitudes and beliefs of the people with the guns.
