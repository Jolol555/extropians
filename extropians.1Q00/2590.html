<EM>&gt; &gt; One should compare apples with apples. TI 'c6x MIPSen look good on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; paper, but do not translate very well in real-time performance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect as much (given that it's a DSP) but don't know any particulars of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the chip.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, for things like emulating neurons, DSPs should do a pretty good
<BR>
job.  Aren't their some examples (@ Columbia?) of large DSP arrays
<BR>
doing neural net stuff?  If neurons do much more than multiply and
<BR>
add, I'd be very surprised.  If you have a thumbtack sized chip
<BR>
with 10^12 OPs, its only going to take ~100-1000 of them to get you
<BR>
human brain &quot;equivalence&quot;.  Thats a box that fits under my desk.
<BR>
Can't take it to bed with me though, as its apt to be a bit *hot*
<BR>
[double entendre intended if you are following the other threads].
<BR>
As I've indicated before it looks like the Moravec/Kurzweil times
<BR>
for Brain equivalent computers (&gt; 2020) are very conservative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, this is why for the new Intel / AMD / IBM chips, clock speed seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the only good indicator of actual performance in mainline tasks.*
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; * = note that I'm talking about chip performance here, rather than system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance.  For system performance, these days a fast bus, big cache, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of RAM seem to contribute more for most tasks than processor speed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect you are up against programming granularity.  Given the rates
<BR>
the chips are operating at you have to be making function calls at
<BR>
a phenomenal rate.  In the large programs we currently have you
<BR>
are going to be flushing the caches at a rather high rate meaning
<BR>
your bus bandwidth is the real constraint.  Thats why you see things
<BR>
like double data rate memory and RAMBUS coming down the pipe.
<BR>
<P>This will not ultimately be solved until we get processor-in-memory.
<BR>
I'll be interesting to see published reports on progress on this
<BR>
(e.g. the Berkeley group work).  For &quot;brain&quot;-like computations,
<BR>
fast chips with a small amount of embedded PROM seems best.
<BR>
Of course this is pretty much what the &quot;Blue Gene&quot; architecture is.
<BR>
<P>Anyone know if deGaris has published any of the technical details
<BR>
of his chip architectures?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they seem to have maxed out the number of functional units and improvements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are trending towards providing specialized multi-media instructions, we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no longer getting general purpose clock-independent peformance boosts from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the new architectures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hopefully VLIW will start to address this in the next few years.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>They seem to be slowly adding functional units but they've got
<BR>
clock distribution, heat dissipation and chip pin counts that
<BR>
are restricting this to a fair degree.  The next &quot;architecture&quot;
<BR>
fix will most likely involve real-time profiling feeding into
<BR>
things like the branch prediction and speculative execution
<BR>
followed by real-time pushing the instruction sequences into
<BR>
actual gate hardware (hardware compiling).  We probably aren't
<BR>
too far away from things like gate-level JAVA interpreters
<BR>
or MS-Word.
<BR>
<P>I'll just add as a footnote, that everything I do (except the
<BR>
simulations for dismantling Jupiter &amp; Saturn) works quite
<BR>
quickly on dual 200MHz Pentium Pro machines until I get to the
<BR>
point where I'm running a dozen or more Netscape &amp; IE windows
<BR>
and MS-Excel and MS-Word and ... So I finally broke down and
<BR>
upgraded one system to 256MB of 60ns ECC RAM.  Now I can
<BR>
open windows for days and things are still very fast.
<BR>
Forget the processor.  Buy memory.  The net is still the
<BR>
limiting factor *even* over an ADSL line.
<BR>
<P>R.
