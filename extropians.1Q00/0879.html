&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I had discussed the problem of nanoprobes encountering black holes.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think that's a serious problem. A stellar black hole is only about 15 miles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in circumference (black holes don't have a meaningful radius) so the chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hitting one directly by accident is almost nil, and a probe moving at 2% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed of light a near direct hit is what you'd need to get into trouble.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good point (Mentally I drop the fact that these objects are
<BR>
really compact).  So the real problem is not so much falling into one
<BR>
but whether or not you can detect any radiation emitted from infalling
<BR>
matter and avoid the high radiation doses, or perhaps more importantly
<BR>
doing the course corrections after one that you didn't &quot;see&quot; drags
<BR>
you off course.  Perhaps one of our rocket engineers would like to
<BR>
comment on how much fuel/energy you would need to correct the deflection
<BR>
caused by a 1g nanoprobe coming within a few AU of a standard stellar
<BR>
mass black hole?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chandra just discovered the closest known black hole to earth, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1600 light years away. What would be really interesting is if it can find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any mini black holes, those about as massive as a mountain and made in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first second of the Big Bang. Such a beast would be super hot but so tiny that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would not be very bright, if one is found it would have be nearby and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would mean mini black holes are common.
</EM><BR>
<P>But that would seem to imply, that there &quot;should&quot; be more astronomical
<BR>
phenomena associated with encounters between &quot;small&quot; black holes and
<BR>
planets, stars, etc.  My impression is that even the smallest black
<BR>
holes should be able to &quot;eat&quot; stars?  Is that not correct?
<BR>
Of course this depends on their density.  I suppose there might also
<BR>
be the question of whether or not in the early history, most of the
<BR>
micro-black-holes got aggregated into the massive black holes that
<BR>
serve as the galaxy seeds.
<BR>
<P>An interesting image though -- you have to form structures that
<BR>
suck matter out of the universe in order to organize the remaining
<BR>
matter into structures that can support life...  I think I hear
<BR>
the twilight zone music in the background...
