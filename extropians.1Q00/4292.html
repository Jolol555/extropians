What about something like Yahoo map? Filight controlled.
<BR>
<P>You go on the traffic net, key in your destination, and a flight path is 
<BR>
prescribed to you. Perhaps it is auto-prescribed, as well. Like boats, you'd 
<BR>
be fully radio''s and ID'd. 
<BR>
<P>Everyone who flies a car has some sort of smart card that ensures that before 
<BR>
they are cleared for take-off, they have this preprogrammed dated and timed, 
<BR>
set of instructions. 
<BR>
<P>Certain flight paths could be reserved for cruising, perhpas at higher 
<BR>
altitudes, for &quot;sunday drivers&quot;.
