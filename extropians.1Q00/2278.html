<EM>&gt;  &gt; Wandering the web I found the following.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; It relates to an earlier discussion on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; this list regarding Velikovsky. I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; it interesting that BBC would be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; brazen as to publish such a thing!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Get out the pitchforks and torches!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whoa, there, EvMick! You're shooting from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hip. You suggest that the theory in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question is as ridiculous as Velikovsky,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it isn't so. Actually, this theory has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little common with Velikovsky. Yes, it has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the orbits of planets changing over time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that's where the similarities end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Without going into detail, the time frames
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are entirely different. Velikovsky has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planets rocketing around the solar system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during the brief duration of human history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This theory involves gradual changes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planetary orbits over hundreds of thousand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of years. Totally different animal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for the BBC being &quot;brazen&quot; in publishing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, you failed to note that (ahem) the journal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Nature&quot; published it first. Obviously,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it must have survived a fair degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peer-review.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to agree here.  I've been following celestial dynamics news for many
<BR>
years now and the consensus seems to be moving away from a model of planets
<BR>
forming where they sit (orbit) to a much more chaotic one where planets tend
<BR>
to wander.
<BR>
<P>That said, Velikovsky's theory is not wrong because it has planets moving
<BR>
around, but because of the time scales involved (as mcsmith points out,
<BR>
though a few 100K years is very quick when you think about it:) and also
<BR>
because of his evidence, some of which includes myths such as Biblical
<BR>
passages.  Not that the Bible is to be totally discounted as evidence, but
<BR>
it certainly is not what I would my base my theory of the formation of solar
<BR>
system on.:)  (If we were discussing religion or philology or Jewish
<BR>
history, then the Bible might be a good piece of evidence.)
<BR>
<P>Back to the emerging model, it seems confirmed somewhat weakly by extrasolar
<BR>
planets and also by Neptune's affect on transneptunian objects like Pluto.
<BR>
(A issue of _American Scientist_ from last year covers the latter problem.)
<BR>
The resonance orbits of the latter seemed best explained by this.
<BR>
<P>Other _additive_ lines of evidence, too, lend more credence to this idea --
<BR>
some of which are detailed in the BBC article, such as that there just does
<BR>
not seem to be that much stuff out there to form Uranus and Neptune
<BR>
according to current estimates of what the early solar system was like.
<BR>
<P>Ad astra!
