<P>&lt;&lt; I define evil as simply abject selfishness.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Funny, that's pretty much how I define what's good and noble.
<BR>
&nbsp;The sine qua non of evil for me is dishonesty. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Clearly many people will consider your philosophy of abject selfishness evil. 
<BR>
Do you enjoy taunting them with that construct? Some selfishness is healthy, 
<BR>
but complete abject selfishness is boring, teious and painfully gauche. It is 
<BR>
anti-social and associated with all of the &quot;evils'&quot; YOU decribe below
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Now I think we probably mostly agree on the specific acts we
<BR>
&nbsp;would classify as &quot;evil&quot;: murder, torture, etc.; but I can't
<BR>
&nbsp;view these as acts of selfishness, because if one were truly
<BR>
&nbsp;selfish and educated emself on the best techniques to profit
<BR>
&nbsp;from others, &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Ahh. So you are not talking ABJECT selfishness, but &quot;educated&quot; selfishness. 
<BR>
One that is tempered by a need to plese others. If only to better serve one's 
<BR>
own goals. 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps your words do not describe your ideas plainly, but in the 
<BR>
preachroneous fashion.
<BR>
<P>ey would choose to cooperate and trade because
<BR>
&nbsp;that's a more profitable strategy than predation in the long
<BR>
&nbsp;run.  Most acts that are described as &quot;selfish&quot; are not evil
<BR>
&nbsp;because they are selfish, but because they exhibit irrational
<BR>
&nbsp;short-term thinking. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>So abject selfishness perhpas is not entirely rational?  
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;The truly selfish individual takes the
<BR>
&nbsp;long view, because ey wants to live forever and be obscenely
<BR>
&nbsp;rich, not just make a few bucks for the moment.
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Long or short viewed, the truly selfish individual is not valued by others, 
<BR>
and is often over valued by his/herself.
