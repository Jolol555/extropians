<blockquote TYPE=CITE>I've just (re)discovered audio books..
<p>I tried it several years ago but there were few if any titles that I
<br>liked....things are somewhat different now .&nbsp; Today I&nbsp; listened
to Tom
<br>Clancy's "Every man A Tiger' from Oklahoma city to Effingham Illinois....it
<br>was the easiest St. Louis Transistion I ever made..
<p>It also confirmed several thoughts I've had concerning our glorious
leaders
<br>vis a vis vietnam..
<p>It also brings to mind a thought.
<p>Hows about some enterprising software type writing a program that would
turn
<br>a paperback book into a CD audio?
<p>possible steps.....
<p>Feeding one page ata time into a scanner.....
<p>OCR software translates to ASCII
<p>ASCII to voice translates to sound...
<p>Possible "tweeks".......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple voices...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound effects...
<p>The end results are there now....for example....listen to Dune: House
<br>Atreides.....( the various "voices" are kinda weak...being done by
only one
<br>guy...but the thought is there)
<p>Actually...I think I'd rather listen to a really good SF book
<br>(unabridged...but with appropriate sound effects) than watch some jerk
make
<br>has out of it as a movie....(StarShip Troopers....which I refuse to
<br>see...from what i've heard and the reviews I've read it's a sin and
a shame
<br>what was done to it..)
<p>I'm just a shade too young to remember old time radio..(.but I might
just get
<br>a few cd's of that too)&nbsp;&nbsp; but from what i understand it was
quiet
<br>entertaining...
<p>Just leave out the mind numbing commercials..
