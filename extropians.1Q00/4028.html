Ten years, ten years, I tell you, no more than ten years!  If we don't have

significant progress by then, we will clearly have in its place, evidence of

our conservatism murduring people.

(end)
<BR>
<P>I will hold you to this!!  I have made a mental note to bring it up to your 
<BR>
attention in ten years time.  I made a &quot;time capsule&quot; by printing out your 
<BR>
post and a copy of the article which I put in a marked manilla envelope.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I would say twenty years for the full range of advances 
<BR>
discussed in the article but I would love to be proven wrong.  The FDA may 
<BR>
very well slow things down but at least some otherwise not done 
<BR>
implementation will be made by other less controlling governments.
<BR>
<P>I remember how gay rights groups battled ferociously with the FDA to have 
<BR>
HIV fighting drugs put into service much sooner then would normally be 
<BR>
allowed.  I wonder if a repeat of this will happen for those (aging boomers) 
<BR>
who want to fight encroaching aging and death.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
