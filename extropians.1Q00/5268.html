<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; some abstract idealist polity or manifesto using ad populum

<EM>&gt; &gt; Then you are no extropian.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, well.  As I said, I can't seem to stress it enough.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats right. I know that everybody here has a revulsion against using
<BR>
words like 'fascist' or 'totalitarian', but statements like yours are
<BR>
exactly what politicians in the past who fit that mold or admitted to
<BR>
such had proposed and put into place. Such 'rational social controls'
<BR>
are always 'needed', and they laugh at 'abstract idealist polity'  and
<BR>
'ad populum terms' as being out of touch, out of tune, with the current
<BR>
needs of 'the people' or 'the children'. They denigrate those who oppose
<BR>
them as being 'socially incompetent', 'illitereate' or 'unable to
<BR>
understand the implications of applying such ideas to the real world'.
<BR>
They also call us 'irresponsible' people who bring on anarchy. They call
<BR>
themselves realists who must deal with reality, not with pie in the sky
<BR>
ideas...  They make themselves sound like the very voice of reason, just
<BR>
until the point after they get control of the government.
<BR>
<P>I don't buy your argument, and I know what you are. If anyone else can't
<BR>
see it, they've got some serious problems.
