<EM>&gt;Far be it from little old me to dispute an icon like Mr. Minsky, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;importance is largely subjective.  What is important to Marvin, may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trivial for me and vice versa.  I do agree that it is impractical to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;postpone one's &quot;search and practice for Enlightenment&quot; until the ultimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questions have been answered.  But that is not what I was suggesting in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first place.  I merely said that, for me, boredom will not set in until all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the questions have been answered.  But my &quot;search and practice for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Enlightenment&quot; is vigorously being pursued on a daily basis.
</EM><BR>

<P>Actually, that was Minsky quoting Siddhartha Gautama
<BR>
(quite a psychonomer in his own right).
<BR>
The only important opinions are handed down by courts with armed
<BR>
marshals. So, obviously, this is just for fun. A creative mind never gets bored,
<BR>
except when stressed-out from generating self-important opinions. A
<BR>
sophisticated, intelligent, central nervous system that doesn't function via
<BR>
limbic inputs or hypothalamus actions would require an enormous amount of work
<BR>
to build, as those who work day and night to build such an entity must know. Do
<BR>
our minds become less stressed-out and given to boredom when we turn off our
<BR>
limbic inputs or hypothalamus actions?
<BR>
<P>Where does stress and boredom go when we awaken to the immensity of
<BR>
consciousness beyond the particular?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>

&quot;Blind faith, no matter how passionately expressed, will not suffice. Science,
<BR>
for its part, will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition
<BR>
and in time uncover the bedrock of moral and religious sentiments.&quot;
