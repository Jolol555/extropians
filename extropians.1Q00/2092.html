</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a much more complicated question than it looks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Actually I knew that.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; answer different if we look at joules per mililiter instead of per gram?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course.  If volume doesnt matter, hydrogen and flourine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pack a tremendous bang per gram.  Solid rocket fuels are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way down on specific impulse per unit weight, but they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exceed liquid rocket impulse as a function of volume.  Furthermore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the answer depends on how you want to actually *use* the energy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For instance, a hand grenade has less chemical energy than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a twinky.  If you are interested in converting energy via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal combustion, good old octane is quite respectable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As far as energy released, a rusting piece of iron does well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are imagining chemical storage for nanoconstruction,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mitochondria have found a good energy transfer medium,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the breakdown of simple sugars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please sharpen the question Stirling.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I am working on a chemical model for futuristic role-playing purposes. 
<BR>
What I am trying to find out (in my naive way) is what is the maximum amount of 
<BR>
energy you can get from a chemical reaction. Any reaction. It doesn't matter if 
<BR>
it takes a billion years to react, or if the energy is produced by expanding 
<BR>
gasses (such as gunpowder) or by heat from simple combustion (as in octane). 
<BR>
The idea is to get an upper bound on the theoretically achievable, and to then 
<BR>
attempt to express different classes of chemical reaction as percentages of the 
<BR>
achievable.  So, if the most energetic reaction produces some X j/g then we 
<BR>
might say that the theoretical maximal gunpower produces kX j/g where k is a 
<BR>
characteristic of that mode of chemical reaction. By the same token, we end up 
<BR>
with factors k1, k2, k3 and so on for theoretical most caloric food, best 
<BR>
rocket propelant, and electricity-producing reaction. I would then attempt to 
<BR>
rate where we stood by doing some research in various newsgroups (including 
<BR>
this one, naturally) to get candidates for our best current tech in each 
<BR>
category. If I can get a coherent enough picture, I can build a tech-level 
<BR>
model for chemical technology.
