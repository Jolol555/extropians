The first country that mandates &quot;peaceful&quot; &quot;smart&quot; people is going to have a 
<BR>
huge competitive advantage.

<BR>
<P>I agree with you!  In this nation right now, so many very high-paying jobs 
<BR>
that require advanced technical and scientific skills simply go begging!  
<BR>
Ever look at the state and federal want ads for computer people?? lol
<BR>
<P>I realize much of this relates more then anything to a population not yet 
<BR>
generally educated to fill these positions.  Perhaps, in another generation 
<BR>
there will be in fact keen competition for all the jobs that currently a 
<BR>
struggle to fill.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately though, since high intelligence tends very much (but does not 
<BR>
promise) to give greater odds of educational and career success for the 
<BR>
individual, I don't see why the same would not be the same for an entire 
<BR>
nation.  Just watch out for the &quot;island scenario&quot; that occurred in &quot;Brave 
<BR>
New World!&quot;  Everyone an alpha could lead to problems!
<BR>
<P>Of course, even a society where everyone had a 180+ I.Q., there will still 
<BR>
be a wide variety of talents and interests that will channel people in many 
<BR>
different ways.  When genetic engineering can also determine that, the 
<BR>
social engineering part will get VERY interesting.  I could see governments 
<BR>
being seen as tyrannical if they did this sort of thing but somehow I would 
<BR>
guess &quot;loving&quot; parents could get away with it!
<BR>
<P>What I envision is a national program that will enable &quot;poor&quot; parents to 
<BR>
have basic genetic engineering packages done to their offspring so that 
<BR>
there will not be a huge gap between the genetic have's and have-not's.  A 
<BR>
package might include resistance or immunity to various ailments and a 
<BR>
certain level of intelligence raising to a certain level to make the 
<BR>
offspring competitive in a challenging world.  Now, if you are a wealthy 
<BR>
parent, you go to a private and expensive clinic to have the latest and 
<BR>
better genetic upgrades put into your next generation.
<BR>
<P>There are some who may say, &quot;this will never be allowed in the U.S. or 
<BR>
Europe!&quot;  But if nation's like mainland China allow (or even encourage) 
<BR>
genetic engineering of their populations then it will become a matter of 
<BR>
&quot;national security&quot; to allow this.  A biological arms race?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
