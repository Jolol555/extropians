<P>Robert, there is a distinct qualitative difference in knowing
<BR>
whether or not Jesus really existed and whether some of his message
<BR>
has a basis in &quot;historic fact&quot; -- meaning he could have been
<BR>
an &quot;alien&quot; trying to do spin control on the evolution of
<BR>
humanity or simply an Eastern guru trying to transplant
<BR>
alternate explanations for unknown phenomena into Judaic
<BR>
mindsets; and Jesus as a fictional construct -- meaning he
<BR>
was the invention of individuals trying to alter the power
<BR>
structures and politics of an era.
<BR>
<P>In one case you've got billions of people believing in an
<BR>
absolute fabrication, in the other you've got billions of
<BR>
people trying to follow the possible insights of someone
<BR>
who may have been either a very wise man or a superior
<BR>
evolved life form.
<BR>
<P>Very very different things.  I guess in my mind, the question
<BR>
is do you group Jesus with Plato or the individuals who committed
<BR>
the Watergate break-ins?
