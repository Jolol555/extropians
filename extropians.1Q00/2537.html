<P><EM>&gt; This whole &quot;until we reach perfection&quot; line of reasoning is pernicious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As David Honig noted in his response, even in &quot;ideal&quot; societies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In particular, an ideal society will still involve competition, both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal and commercial. I don't want my rivals reading my plans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how ideal the society is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You seem to be thinking of the Eloi as being the ideal society. Feh.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tim,
<BR>
<P>If you were to read the sentence that follows the one you quoted, you would
<BR>
find that I say &quot;however, until such time&quot; to acknowledge two things.
<BR>
Firstly, that an ideal society takes time to reach (if at all reachable),
<BR>
and secondly, that when an ideal society is reached, it needs to prevent
<BR>
itself from slipping back to a non-ideal society. These principles apply
<BR>
regardless of whether cryptography is available.
<BR>
<P>So Tim, in fact, I agree with you in principle. However, I am not sure about
<BR>
your assertion that an ideal society will involve competition.
<BR>
<P>In any case, the two important things are: a) there is still a need for
<BR>
cryptography in either case, and b) cryptography can be considered a pivot
<BR>
for the power relationship between individuals and society. Which, really,
<BR>
comes back to cryptography as an &quot;armament&quot; (cf. continual scaling of
<BR>
constructive [cryptographic] and destructive [cryptobreaking] technologies,
<BR>
which itself is a generalisable aspect of not only society, but the aspect
<BR>
of escalating power irrespective of the media in which it is manifested).
<BR>
<P>The more generalisable conclusion is that in a purely digital environment,
<BR>
cryptographic mechanisms are the codification of rules and ethics. A most
<BR>
interesting study would be to codify well established ideas of ethics and
<BR>
morality (as they have evolved over history), and try to make a direct
<BR>
comparison with theoretical and realisable cryptographic constructs (as they
<BR>
are a recent construction!). Then, there'd be an interesting side by side
<BR>
comparison between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;digital&quot; worlds, and some general
<BR>
understandings about the translations between the two.
<BR>
<P>(the next cool study is to construct an analysis of &quot;systems of
<BR>
negotiation&quot; -- i.e. speech, humans, transport protocols, cryptographic
<BR>
protocols, military strategy, dialetic, etc -- as a means of understanding
<BR>
parallels between the generalisable aspects of negotiation and
<BR>
cryptography -- which is really just a negotiation, but in another
<BR>
mathematical domain, etc: the cool thing then of course to unify some of the
<BR>
work in provable transformations between theory and implementation in
<BR>
cyptography, and work in other domains)
<BR>
<P>Good to know that I provoked a reaction in any case ;-). That is my creative
<BR>
madness over for the week.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Matthew.
