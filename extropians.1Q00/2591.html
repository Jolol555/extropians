&lt;&lt; &gt; Following up on the crypto angle, there's also a technology called
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;group&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; signatures, which requires a group of people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (or some subset) to work together to create a signature.  Years ago I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suggested the ultimate democracy, Anything Boxes which would only create
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; objects which were signed by a threshold signature meaning that (say)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 80% of the human race approved that design.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;That's a good take on it. Or just a signature system that's open to
<BR>
&nbsp;public authentication and relies on enough people agreeing that the source
<BR>
&nbsp;to some new object is clean.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Trouble is, how do you make a system that can cope appropriately with
<BR>
&nbsp;a group like, say, Aum Shinryko, membership in the tens of thousands, who
<BR>
&nbsp;want to immanetize the eschaton (by building grey goo), without denying,
<BR>
&nbsp;say, smaller groups like, say, Alcor, membership somewhat smaller,
<BR>
&nbsp;who want to build their ressurect-o-mat(TM) (for all the corpsicles in
<BR>
&nbsp;their freezer)? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Instead of a majority vote, how about a majority veto?  A proposed design is 
<BR>
sent out to everyone, and is approved after a length of time unless a 
<BR>
majority of people vote against it.  This way you don't have to have the 
<BR>
approval of anyone, just their indifference.  This would likely allow 
<BR>
projects perceived as harmless but of interest only to a minority to go 
<BR>
forward, but block those projects that might be truly dangerous.  If you 
<BR>
wanted to be more cautious, you could set the percent needed for a successful 
<BR>
veto even lower.
