<EM>&gt; &gt;I would say that &quot;rationally&quot;, there probably are (rare) cases when

<EM>&gt; &gt;infanticide is justified.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At first I didn't know what you were talking about, how any such case could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist, but I remember reading about a Jewish mother in a concentration camp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who had a child, and she was forbidden to feed it, for the purpose of a Nazi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiment to determine how long the child could go without food before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dying, so she smothered the baby.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I don't think it's cases like these that the college professor in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question was speaking of.

<EM>&gt;

<P>I believe that I have discussed (quite some time back) tradeoffs
<BR>
mothers have to make in supplying food to young children vs. infants.
<BR>
If the food supply is scarce, infanticide makes complete sense to
<BR>
save the older childran (who have a higher information content and caloric
<BR>
investment).
<BR>
<P>Infanticide might also make sense if the child was from a father other
<BR>
than the primary mate and its characteristics could lead to the
<BR>
discovery of the unfaithfullness, leading to doubt on the part of
<BR>
the primary mate regarding the origin of existing children, perhaps
<BR>
resulting in paternal violence against the children or woman.
<BR>
[This is stretching...]
<BR>
<P>But the primary reason would presumably be infants with defects that
<BR>
would require an investment that could never be returned to society.
<BR>
(This reason could have been valid in ancient times or in primitive
<BR>
tribes, but is a doubtful rationale given the pace of technological
<BR>
change and the possibility of future corrections of such defects.)
