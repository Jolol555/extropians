<BR>
<P>Text of the RIAA lawsuit filed against MP3.com on
<BR>
January 21, 2000: 
<BR>
<P>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
<BR>
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
<BR>
UMG RECORDINGS, INC., SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT INC.,
<BR>
WARNER BROS. RECORDS INC., ARISTA RECORDS INC.,
<BR>
ATLANTIC RECORDING CORPORATION, BMG MUSIC d/b/a THE
<BR>
RCA RECORDS LABEL, CAPITOL RECORDS, INC., ELEKTRA

<BR>
Plaintiffs,
<BR>
vs.
<BR>
MP3.COM, INC., 
<BR>
Defendant.
<BR>
<P>Case No.: 00 Civ. 0472 (JSR)
<BR>
<P><P>COMPLAINT FOR
<BR>
COPYRIGHT
<BR>
INFRINGEMENT 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Plaintiffs, by their counsel, allege as follows: 
<BR>
<P><P>INTRODUCTION
<BR>
<P><P>1.      This litigation seeks relief against an
<BR>
ongoing infringement of the copyrights in the sound
<BR>
recordings on some 45,000 audio CDs, most of which
<BR>
copyrights are owned by the plaintiff recording
<BR>
companies. The defendant made unauthorized copies of
<BR>
those 45,000 audio CDs, loaded the unauthorized copies
<BR>
onto file servers, and is permitting users of its
<BR>
Internet service to listen to and download those
<BR>
unauthorized copies. Despite the plaintiffs' requests,
<BR>
the defendant has refused to discontinue this massive
<BR>
ongoing infringement. The plaintiffs seek declaratory
<BR>
and injunctive relief, and statutory damages for
<BR>
willful copyright infringement. 
<BR>
<P>NATURE OF THE CASE
<BR>
<P><P>2.      Plaintiffs bring this action seeking
<BR>
declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief against
<BR>
MP3.com, Inc. (&quot;MP3.com&quot;), a publicly-held company
<BR>
which operates a commercial Internet site at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mp3.com">http://www.mp3.com</A>. At this site, MP3.com recently
<BR>
began offering two new &quot;breakthrough products&quot; through
<BR>
its &quot;upgraded&quot; My.MP3.com service (<A HREF="http://my.mp3.com">http://my.mp3.com</A>)
<BR>
(&quot;My.MP3&quot;). In particular, My.MP3 now allows a user to
<BR>
listen, via the Internet, to the tracks of almost any
<BR>
commercial audio CD of his or her choosing, and to
<BR>
download digital copies of those CD tracks. 
<BR>
<P>3.      In order to create and offer this &quot;upgraded&quot;
<BR>
service, MP3.com copied the tracks from some 45,000
<BR>
commercial CDs onto the computer servers that operate
<BR>
the MP3.com site and the My.MP3 service. Plaintiffs
<BR>
are among the leading manufacturers of phonorecords in
<BR>
the United States and own the copyrights in most of
<BR>
the hundreds of thousands of copyrighted sound
<BR>
recordings contained on the CDs that MP3.com copied.
<BR>
At no time have plaintiffs ever authorized MP3.com to
<BR>
make any reproductions of their copyrighted works or
<BR>
to offer the My.MP3 service. 
<BR>
<P>4.      To receive access to the tracks from a
<BR>
commercial CD over the My.MP3 service, a user need
<BR>
only do one of two things: First, the user can place
<BR>
an order for the commercial CD from one of several
<BR>
online CD retailers cooperating with MP3.com (&quot;Instant
<BR>
Listening Service&quot;). Second, the user can insert a
<BR>
commercial CD (or a copy, authorized or unauthorized,
<BR>
of a commercial CD) into his or her computer CD-ROM
<BR>
drive for a few seconds (&quot;Beam-it&quot;). Once a user has
<BR>
either placed the order or briefly inserted the CD,
<BR>
My.MP3 gives him or her permanent access to listen to
<BR>
or download the infringing reproductions of the CD's
<BR>
tracks from the defendant's server, on demand, at any
<BR>
place and through any device that can access the
<BR>
MP3.com site through the Internet. The My.MP3 service
<BR>
is further described in pages from the MP3.com Web
<BR>
site attached hereto as Appendix A. 
<BR>
<P>5.      Under Section 106 of the Copyright Act of
<BR>
1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;),
<BR>
plaintiffs have the exclusive right, among other
<BR>
things, to make reproductions of their copyrighted
<BR>
sound recordings in all forms. This is one of the most
<BR>
sacrosanct rights afforded copyright owners. 
<BR>
<P>6.      Plaintiffs seek a declaration that MP3.com's
<BR>
unauthorized copying of plaintiffs' copyrighted sound
<BR>
recordings onto MP3.com's computer servers willfully
<BR>
infringes plaintiffs; copyrights in violation of the
<BR>
Copyright Act. Plaintiffs further seek injunctive
<BR>
relief prohibiting MP3.com from operating My.MP3 or
<BR>
any other service that uses any infringing
<BR>
reproduction of plaintiffs' copyrighted sound
<BR>
recordings. Plaintiffs pray also for statutory damages
<BR>
for willful copyright infringement in the amount
<BR>
specified in Section 504 of the Copyright Act. 
<BR>
<P>JURISDICTION AND VENUE
<BR>
<P><P>7.      This is a civil action seeking declaratory,
<BR>
injunctive and monetary relief for infringement under
<BR>
the copyright laws of the United States (17 U.S.C. §
<BR>
101 et seq.). The Court has jurisdiction over the
<BR>
subject matter of this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1338
<BR>
(a). 
<BR>
<P>8.      This Court has personal jurisdiction over the
<BR>
defendant because defendant offers a service to
<BR>
residents of the State and this District which harms
<BR>
the copyrights owned by residents of this State and
<BR>
this District, and defendant is otherwise doing
<BR>
business in this State and this District. 
<BR>
<P>9.      Venue is properly laid in this District
<BR>
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § § 1391 (b) and (c), and 1400
<BR>
(a). 
<BR>
<P>PARTIES
<BR>
<P><P>10.      Plaintiff UMG RECORDINGS, INC. is a
<BR>

of the State of California, with its principal place
<BR>
of business in Los Angeles County, California, and a
<BR>

<BR>
general partnership with its principal place in Los
<BR>
Angeles County, California, which is licensed to do
<BR>
business in New York. 
<BR>
<P><P>19.      Plaintiff SIRE RECORDS GROUP INC. is a
<BR>
corporation duly organized and existing under the laws
<BR>
of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of
<BR>
business in New York, New York. 
<BR>
<P>20.      Plaintiffs are engaged in the business of
<BR>
producing sound recordings, and manufacturing,
<BR>
distributing, selling and/or licensing the
<BR>
distribution and sale of their sound recordings on
<BR>
phonorecords (as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101), or
<BR>
arranging to do so in the United States. The most
<BR>
common form of phonorecord is an audio CD, but the
<BR>
term &quot;phonorecord&quot; includes any object that contains a
<BR>
sound recording, such as a computer audio file, analog
<BR>
cassette tape, vinyl album, or digital audio tape.
<BR>
Plaintiffs are among the leading manufacturers of
<BR>
phonorecords in the United States. The names and
<BR>
reputations of plaintiffs as manufacturers of
<BR>
phonorecords of high artistic and technical quality
<BR>
are widely and favorably known in the State of New
<BR>
York and throughout the United States and the world. 
<BR>
<P>21.      Defendant MP3.com, upon information and
<BR>
belief, is a corporation organized under the laws of
<BR>
the State of Delaware, with its principal place of
<BR>
business in the State of California. Defendant
<BR>
operates its business through a commercial Web site
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.mp3.com">http://www.mp3.com</A>) that provides, among other
<BR>
things, information about music and the use of the
<BR>
&quot;mp3&quot; digital audio format, digital downloads of
<BR>
music, and the My.MP3 interactive service. Defendant's
<BR>
My.MP3 service is targeted to and used by residents of
<BR>
this State and this District, and infringes copyrights
<BR>
owned by residents of this State and this District. 
<BR>
<P>PLAINTIFFS' COPYRIGHTED SOUND RECORDINGS
<BR>
<P><P>22.      &quot;Sound Recordings&quot; are defined by the
<BR>
Copyright Act to be &quot;works that result from the
<BR>
fixation of a series of musical, spoken or other
<BR>
sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a
<BR>
motion picture or other audio visual work...,&quot; 17
<BR>
U.S.C. § 101, that is, versions or renditions of
<BR>
musical compositions. Sound recording are protected by
<BR>
copyright, separate from the underlying musical
<BR>
compositions. 
<BR>
<P>23.      Plaintiffs are the United States copyright
<BR>
owners or the owners of exclusive rights under
<BR>
copyright with respect to certain copyrighted sound
<BR>
recording embodied in their phonorecords, including
<BR>
but not limited to those listed in Appendix B and
<BR>
incorporated by reference herein (hereinafter
<BR>
&quot;Copyrighted Recording&quot;). Each plaintiff has applied
<BR>
for and/or received Certificates of Copyright
<BR>
Registration from the Register of Copyrights for its
<BR>
Copyrighted Recordings. Under Section 106 of the
<BR>
Copyright Act, each plaintiff has the exclusive right,
<BR>
among other things, &quot;to reproduce the [Copyrighted
<BR>
Recordings] in ... phonorecords.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>24.      Plaintiffs have invested and continue to
<BR>
invest substantial sums of money, as well as time,
<BR>
effort, and creative talent, to discover and develop
<BR>
recording artists, and to create, manufacture,
<BR>
advertise, promote, sell, and license phonorecords
<BR>
embodying the performances of their exclusive
<BR>
recording artists. In order to create such
<BR>
phonorecords, plaintiffs make payments to these
<BR>
recording artists, other musicians, various trust
<BR>
funds established for musicians' benefit, producers,
<BR>
technicians, and other staff personnel, as well as
<BR>
various other payments. Plaintiffs and their recording
<BR>
artists are compensated for their creative efforts and
<BR>
monetary investments largely from the sale of
<BR>
phonorecords to the public and from license fees
<BR>
received from the reproduction, distribution, digital
<BR>
performance, or other exploitation of such
<BR>
phonorecords. Absent such compensation, profits and
<BR>
motivation are siphoned away from artists and the
<BR>
record companies that record, manufacture, promote,
<BR>
and distribute those works. The pool of resources
<BR>
available for finding and promoting new artists
<BR>
shrinks, and sound quality and recording integrity are
<BR>
diluted and corrupted. The ultimate result is that the
<BR>
public's access to a wide variety of high quality
<BR>
musical recordings is sharply curtailed. 
<BR>
<P>DEFENDANT'S INFRINGING &quot;MY.MP3&quot; SERVICE
<BR>
<P><P>25.      On or about January 12, 2000, Defendant
<BR>
introduced its &quot;upgraded&quot; My.MP3 service to the
<BR>
public. The press release announcing the revised
<BR>
My.MP3 explained that: &quot;[t]he new service, currently
<BR>
free to consumers, contains two breakthrough
<BR>
products--Instant Listening ServiceTM and
<BR>
Beam-itTM--that allow consumers to store, customize
<BR>
and listen to their CDs from anywhere, anytime using
<BR>
the open portals of web-enabled devices.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>26.      In order to create and offer this service,
<BR>
defendant copied every track from 45,000 commercial
<BR>
audio CDs onto its computer servers. All or virtually
<BR>
all of these audio CDs are marked as copyrighted and
<BR>
contain explicit notices prohibiting unauthorized
<BR>
copying. When users access sound recordings though
<BR>
My.MP3, it is these infringing reproductions that are
<BR>
accessed. Included among these infringing
<BR>
reproductions are copies of thousands of copyrighted
<BR>
sound recordings owned by plaintiffs, none of whom has
<BR>
authorized defendant to make any such reproductions. 
<BR>
<P>27.      Through My.MP3, a user can get access to any
<BR>
of the infringing reproductions made by defendant that
<BR>
he or she chooses, listen to a performance made from
<BR>
those infringing reproductions through any device,
<BR>
such as a computer, that can access MP3.com's Web
<BR>
site, and download copies of those infringing
<BR>
reproductions. The user obtains permanent access to
<BR>
the infringing reproductions by placing an order for
<BR>
or confirming to defendant that he is in the
<BR>
possession of an audio CD (or a copy, authorized or
<BR>
unauthorized, of an audio CD) containing those sound
<BR>
recordings. 
<BR>
<P>28.      The user does not and cannot copy his or her
<BR>
own CD onto the My.MP3 computer servers. The My.MP3
<BR>
service is built on and only grants access to the
<BR>
infringing reproductions made by defendant. 
<BR>
<P>29.      Upon information and belief, My.MP3 is
<BR>
currently being offered free of charge to users.
<BR>
Defendant has indicated that it intends to sell
<BR>
subscriptions to the service in the future. The My.MP3
<BR>
service contains advertisements on its Web pages that
<BR>
a user sees when he or she listens to or downloads
<BR>
music via My.MP3. 
<BR>
<P>30.      Defendant has been advised by representatives
<BR>
of the plaintiffs that defendant's unauthorized
<BR>
reproduction of commercial CDs violates the Copyright
<BR>
Act, and defendant has been urged to discontinue its
<BR>
infringing activities. Defendant has refused to do so.
<BR>
Upon information and belief, defendant also has taken
<BR>
no steps to inform the users of its My.MP3 service or
<BR>
any other interested persons that music made available
<BR>
for listening and download through the My.MP3 service
<BR>
consists of infringing reproductions of copyrighted
<BR>
sound recordings. 
<BR>
<P>COUNT I
<BR>
(Copyright Infringement)
<BR>
<P><P>31.      Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the
<BR>
allegations of paragraphs 1 through 30, above. 
<BR>
<P>32.      This claim is brought pursuant to the
<BR>
Copyright Act and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (a), seeking
<BR>
declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. There is
<BR>
an actual controversy between the plaintiffs and
<BR>
defendant. 
<BR>
<P>33.      Under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, each
<BR>
plaintiff has the exclusive right to reproduce its
<BR>
Copyrighted Recordings in copies or phonorecords, and
<BR>
the exclusive right to authorize the reproduction of
<BR>
its Copyrighted Recordings in copies or phonorecords. 
<BR>
<P>34.      Unauthorized reproduction of Copyrighted
<BR>
Recordings constitutes infringement of the exclusive
<BR>
rights under Section 106 of the Copyright Act.
<BR>
Defendant has willfully and with full knowledge of
<BR>
plaintiffs' copyrights made infringing reproductions
<BR>
of thousands of plaintiffs' copyrighted sound
<BR>
recordings for the purpose of operating its commercial
<BR>
My.MP3 interactive service. 
<BR>
<P>35.      As a direct and proximate result of the
<BR>
foregoing acts of infringement by defendant,
<BR>
plaintiffs have been and will continue to be
<BR>
irreparably injured. 
<BR>
<P>36.      As a direct and proximate result of the
<BR>
foregoing acts of infringement by defendant,
<BR>
plaintiffs are entitled to damages and profits under
<BR>
Section 504 of the Copyright Act, including statutory
<BR>
damages for willful infringement in an amount to be
<BR>
established at trial. 
<BR>
<P>RELIEF
<BR>
<P><P>WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgement and relief as
<BR>
follows:
<BR>
<P><P>A.      For a declaration that defendant has willfully
<BR>
infringed the copyrights of plaintiffs in the
<BR>
Copyrighted Recordings by making unauthorized
<BR>
reproductions of such works as part of its My.MP3.com
<BR>
interactive service; 
<BR>
<P>B.      For a preliminary and permanent injunction
<BR>
requiring defendant, its agents, employees, and other
<BR>
persons acting in concert with, or for, them (i) to
<BR>
cease and deist operation of My.MP3 or any other
<BR>
service that uses infringing reproductions of
<BR>
plaintiffs' Copyrighted Recordings (ii) to cease and
<BR>
desist from making any infringing copies of the
<BR>
Copyrighted Recordings; and (iii) to destroy any
<BR>
infringing copies of the Copyrighted Recordings in the
<BR>
possession of defendant, including without limitation
<BR>
any infringing copies on defendant's computer servers;
<BR>
<P><P>C.      For an award of damages, including, without
<BR>
limitation, statutory damages for willful infringement
<BR>
of $150,000 per work infringed; 
<BR>
<P>D.      For an award of the costs of this action,
<BR>
including reasonable attorneys' and expert witness
<BR>
fees; and 
<BR>
<P>E.      For such other and further relief as the Court
<BR>
may deem just and proper. 
<BR>
<P>Dated: New York, New York

<P>Woah. Do they seriously mean $150,000 per *album*? Or
<BR>
even worse, $150,000 per *song*? Even per album,
<BR>
that's... let's see... at 45,000 albums.....
<BR>
(US)$6,750,000,000.
<BR>
That's right, six - nearly seven - *billion* dollars.
<BR>
Woah.
