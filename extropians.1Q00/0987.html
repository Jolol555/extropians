<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                           January 19, 2000
<BR>
<P>LA NINA's PERSISTENCE MAY BE PART OF LARGER CLIMATE PATTERN
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant horseshoe pattern of higher than normal sea-surface 
<BR>
heights developing over the last year is beginning to dominate 
<BR>
the entire western Pacific and Asiatic oceans, new imagery from 
<BR>
the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon satellite shows. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, 
<BR>
Calif., studying the new data believe these abnormally warm ocean 
<BR>
temperatures, which contrast with a cool La NiNa, may be part of 
<BR>
a larger, longer-lasting climate pattern.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest data, taken December 30, 1999 through January 8, 
<BR>
2000, show that this slower-developing condition covers most of 
<BR>
the Pacific Ocean and has significant implications for global 
<BR>
climate change, especially over North America, said Dr. William 
<BR>
Patzert, an oceanographer at JPL. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In contrast with the more spectacular but shorter duration 
<BR>
El NiNo and La NiNa events, this multiple-year trend may be part 
<BR>
of a decade-long pattern known as the 'Pacific decadal 
<BR>
oscillation,'&quot; Patzert said. &quot;The persistence of these abnormally 
<BR>
high and low Pacific sea-surface patterns, along with warmer and 
<BR>
colder than average ocean temperatures, tells us there is much 
<BR>
more than an isolated La Niqa occurring in the Pacific Ocean.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satellite data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
<BR>
Administration clearly illustrate the pattern. Sea-surface 
<BR>
temperatures, which directly affect the atmosphere on a daily 
<BR>
basis, are available at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/PSB/EPS/SST/climo.html">http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/PSB/EPS/SST/climo.html</A> , and 
<BR>
show the same warm and cool water patterns. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These warmer and cooler than normal sea-surface 
<BR>
temperatures influence our atmosphere every day, while sea-
<BR>
surface heights are a measure of how much heat is stored in the 
<BR>
ocean below,&quot; Patzert said. &quot;When you put these two pieces of the 
<BR>
climate puzzle together, they will tell us both about what is 
<BR>
influencing today's weather and how much heat is being stored in 
<BR>
the ocean to fuel future planetary climate events.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pacific decadal oscillation waxes and wanes 
<BR>
approximately every 20 to 30 years, alternating between its 
<BR>
present phase, with a warm horseshoe pattern of higher than 
<BR>
normal sea-surface heights connecting the north, west and 
<BR>
southern Pacific, in contrast to a cool wedge of lower than 
<BR>
normal sea-surface heights in the eastern equatorial Pacific. 
<BR>
After that the Pacific switches to the opposite phase, showing a 
<BR>
reversal of the warm and cool regions; the horseshoe becomes cool 
<BR>
and the wedge warms.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of this climate trend is seen in the current 
<BR>
TOPEX/Poseidon satellite image, available at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino</A> . Sea-surface height is shown 
<BR>
relative to normal (green) height and reveals cooler water (blue 
<BR>
and purple) measuring between 8 and 24 centimeters (3 and 9 
<BR>
inches) lower than normal along the coast of Central and South 
<BR>
America, and stretching out into the equatorial Pacific. The 
<BR>
giant horseshoe of warmer water (red and white) dominating the 
<BR>
western and mid-latitude Pacific has higher than normal sea-
<BR>
surface heights of between 8 and 24 centimeters (3 and 9 inches). 
<BR>
For the past year, warmer waters have been expanding slowly and 
<BR>
are now beginning to dominate the western and north Pacific. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is too early to definitively label these basin-
<BR>
wide conditions as a strong, multiple-year Pacific decadal 
<BR>
oscillation, the current image suggests that simple labels or 
<BR>
explanations such as a continuing La Nina/El Nino climate 
<BR>
condition could be misleading, Patzert said. In the coming year, 
<BR>
scientists using TOPEX/Poseidon data will continue to monitor the 
<BR>
development of these conditions and their implications for 
<BR>
climate in the next several years.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission is managed JPL for 
<BR>
the NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, Washington, D.C. JPL is a 
<BR>
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
