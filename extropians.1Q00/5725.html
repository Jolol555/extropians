<EM>&gt;ABSTRACT:  What daring 21st century concepts or projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would you most like to see pursued, if money were no object?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hello friends, this is a quick query for some of the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imaginative and tech savvy people I know.  *What bold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;endeavors do you wish you could see funded in the next decade?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The reason I ask is that I've been invited to speak at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hifalutin meeting about philanthropy, specifically dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with two extraordinary pools of capital: ... Initiatives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with high risk-of-failure, combined with extraordinary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefits in the event of success.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't going to respond, but then I found I didn't care
<BR>
much for all the other suggestions, though I did like
<BR>
Brin's &quot;Henchman's Fund&quot; proposal.
<BR>
<P>One project is to convince one relatively rich economy
<BR>
somewhere to completely open its borders to immigration,
<BR>
even setting up a loan program to pay for transportation
<BR>
costs.  This might do more for the world's poor than most
<BR>
anything I can imagine.  And that one country could
<BR>
benefit immensely.
<BR>
<P>Another project is to create one or more widely-accessible
<BR>
low-transaction-cost web sites allowing general betting.
<BR>
Lots of betting on technology questions is the best way
<BR>
I know to improve how we learn about new technologies;
<BR>
betting markets help us share and combine info in ways
<BR>
that other social institutions just can not.
<BR>
<P>Yet another project is to explore the vast untouched
<BR>
space of possible forms of government.  Because democracy
<BR>
seems better than monarchy, people seem to have concluded
<BR>
that current forms of democracy are the best there is.
<BR>
In fact, we have barely dipped our toe into the ocean
<BR>
of possible forms of government.  (For an example of
<BR>
a very different possible form, as me about &quot;futarchy.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>Regarding specific technological innovations, I think the
<BR>
best way to promote them is two offer large prizes for
<BR>
specific achievements.  I would like to see much larger
<BR>
prizes offered for progress toward nanotech assemblers,
<BR>
and for progress toward uploading of humans into computers.
<BR>
<P>The big projects I think of as a waste are most space,
<BR>
medicine, and education, and parenting projects.  These last
<BR>
three are feel good projects, but the sad truth is that
<BR>
medicine, education, and parenting don't actually do very
<BR>
much useful on the margin; we could cut way back on these
<BR>
without much harm.  Space projects now also seem a waste to
<BR>
me; until costs are low enough to allow economies to
<BR>
flourish in space, it's just money down the drain.
