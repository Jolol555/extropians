<EM>&gt;Maybe you're being sarcastic and I can't quite tell.. if not, can you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elaborate on that a little bit? How is the drug use of someone a threat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone else, in particular &quot;the ruling class&quot; (and can you outline who they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If anyone, including members of the ruling class, face a legitimate threat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by someone else's drug use (which they don't), then the drug war *would* be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;justified.
</EM><BR>
<P>The WOD is not justified, and neither is the ruling class.
<BR>
<P>It is not drug use itself which threatens the ruling class, but rather the
<BR>
effects of drug use. And it is not _all_ drug use that threatens the ruling
<BR>
class. Indeed, members of the ruling class may themselves take drugs. Just put
<BR>
yourself in the place of the rulers to see how this works. Suppose you
<BR>
administer a city, county, state or some other segment of the social order. You
<BR>
will have to work hard to get such a position.
<BR>
<P>What makes you want to get to such a position? (Of course, I'm not saying that
<BR>
you do want to, but try to understand the mind set of someone who does.)
<BR>
Aspiring to a position of authority is the opposite of aspiring to the cognitive
<BR>
anarchy of experimenting with drugs. What makes a person want to rule is
<BR>
diametrically opposite to what makes a person want to take the kind of drugs
<BR>
we're talking about here. Consequently, the mind set of hippies is in direct
<BR>
opposition to the mind set of the ruling class.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps. Let me know if you follow this so far.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>J. R. Molloy
