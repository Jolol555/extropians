What impresses me are your coarse manners and the extent to which your 
<BR>
self-importance is based on a pompous assumption that you have somehow 
<BR>
managed to transform trivial platitudes into profundities.  I apologize to 
<BR>
the list for this exasperated statement, but I simply cannot tolerate the 
<BR>
sheer loutishness and incivility exhibited here by this supercilious young 
<BR>
man.  There isn't the slightest possibility of any consideration of your 
<BR>
subsequent remarks, Shaun, unless you resolve to present yourself in a 
<BR>
reasonably acculturated manner, meaning, as a gentleman.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>At this point Robert Owen slaps Shaun in the face with a glove and says, &quot;I 
<BR>
demand satisfaction!&quot;  &quot;Do you prefer the foil or the pistol?&quot;  If the duel 
<BR>
is done by the knowlege and use of big five-dollar words (as Ben Grimm would 
<BR>
say) then you have no chance Shaun! :)
<BR>
<P>I honestly think Shaun was just kidding around in taking a &quot;cheap shot&quot; and 
<BR>
did not mean it as an insult to Robert Owen.  I understand that we all have 
<BR>
our own unique perspectives of how we and others should behave and so 
<BR>
buttons can be pushed unintentionally.  I don't want to see any duelling at 
<BR>
the next Extro!  I like both these guys and hope things can be worked out.
<BR>
