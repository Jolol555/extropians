Black Hole Found Near Earth 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>ATLANTA –– Four bursts of X-ray energy have alerted astronomers to a black 
<BR>
hole just 1,600 light years away from Earth, practically on the doorstep in 
<BR>
astronomical terms. 
<BR>
<P>The black hole was discovered last September after an Australian amateur 
<BR>
astronomer noticed the suddenly brightening of a star and notified the pros. 
<BR>
<P>Donald Smith, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology astronomer, and others 
<BR>
focused X-ray detectors on the target star and quickly got a surprise. On 
<BR>
Sept. 14, the black hole announced its presence with an eruption of X-rays 
<BR>
that was brief, but dramatic. 
<BR>
<P>Three other eruptions followed, each one lasting less than two hours. But it 
<BR>
was enough for Smith and a team of radio astronomers to determine that the 
<BR>
energy was coming from a black hole. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is one of the fastest (bursts) we have ever seen,&quot; said Robert M. 
<BR>
Hjellming of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. 
<BR>
<P>Smith said that although the bursts were brief, at peak output they were the 
<BR>
brightest source of X-rays in the sky, except for the sun. 
<BR>
<P>The black hole is located in constellation Sagittari and centers on a star 
<BR>
called V4641 Sgr. 
<BR>
<P>Smith said the bursts come and go so rapidly that it may represent a new 
<BR>
subclass of X-ray-producing objects. 
<BR>
<P>Radio telescopes detected twin jets of matter firing out of the black hole 
<BR>
region at nearly the speed of light. Three other similar X-ray sources have 
<BR>
been detected in distant parts of the universe and called by astronomers 
<BR>
&quot;microquasars.&quot; They resemble quasars, but are much smaller. 
<BR>
<P>But Hjellming said energy bursts from the other microquasars fade more 
<BR>
slowly, often lasting for weeks. 
<BR>
<P>A black hole is an extremely dense object with a gravitation field so 
<BR>
powerful that not even light can escape. As a black hole pulls matter into 
<BR>
its center, gas and dust are heated to millions of degrees. This gives off 
<BR>
X-rays that can be detected by X-ray telescopes. 
<BR>
<P>Many black holes acquire an envelope of gas and dust called an accretion 
<BR>
disk. Matter from the disk streams constantly into the black hole, triggering 
<BR>
a steady X-ray signal. Black holes are usually in the center of quasars and 
<BR>
characteristically have accretion disks. 
<BR>
<P>The brief bursts from the V4641 Sgr black hole suggests it is not being fed 
<BR>
constantly by a reservoir of matter from an accretion disk. This puzzles 
<BR>
astronomers. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Either the matter can flow into the black hole without forming an accretion 
<BR>
disk or the black hole is significantly different in its mass, spin or 
<BR>
charge,&quot; said Ronald Remmillard of MIT.
