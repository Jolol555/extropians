Well, the fact of the matter is that the average individual presently has no 
<BR>
need whatsoever for control over large systems of machines. I personally 
<BR>
would have no idea what to do with a supercomputer, besides writing and 
<BR>
reading, like I do on my lowly Pentium class box.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I know what I would do with my own supercomputer, I would donate it to the 
<BR>
University of Alaska, ANCHORAGE!!  The crafty fellows over at the University 
<BR>
of Alaska, FAIRBANKS duped a goofy Alaskan senator to get them a 
<BR>
supercomputer.  How??  The good senator believed that power could be easily 
<BR>
drawn from the Aurora Borealis!!  Oil is simply not enough, it seems!!  The 
<BR>
UAF folks said they would work hard on the project but needed a 
<BR>
supercomputer to get started...  Those crafty devils got their computer and 
<BR>
later told the senator the project was not as possible as it had originally 
<BR>
seemed. lol
<BR>
<P>Now if only UAA could come up with a project that appealed to the good 
<BR>
senator in such a way that he could be taken for a ride TWICE!  Cold 
<BR>
fusion?, magic physics?, or how about a supercomputer to hack into election 
<BR>
results and make sure he is re-elected despite his stupidity.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
