<EM>&gt; &gt;Similarly, the fact that culturescan change rapidly doesn't

<EM>&gt; &gt;say that we can do much by deliberately trying to change our

<EM>&gt; &gt;culture.  The size of the deliberate influence may be small

<EM>&gt; &gt;compared to the other processes involved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Much of the rapid change that we have experienced, just in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;America, over the past 100 years has been the result of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work of humans committed to change and progress--scientists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;activists, political leaders, authors, the founders of the Internet.

<P>If you march up the beach with the tide, did you move the water?
<BR>
What if you float down a river?  It is very hard to tell how much
<BR>
&quot;humans committed to change&quot; have actually changed things.  At any
<BR>
given time various people advocate all sorts of changes, and the
<BR>
people who advocated the changes that actually happened often try
<BR>
to take credit for them.  But how much credit do they deserve?
<BR>
<P>Powerful demographic, economic, and other forces induce all sorts
<BR>
of social changes, and there is a big demand for spokespersons
<BR>
to explain and justify these changes.  Even if you could say that
<BR>
these changes wouldn't have happened unless certain arguments were
<BR>
made to a wide audience, it is still not clear how much credit to
<BR>
give those who made the arguments.  If there were a large pool of
<BR>
spokesperson-wannabes out there, seeking arguments which could make
<BR>
them famous, then the arguments might just regularly get made when
<BR>
the audience is ready to hear them.

<P><EM>&gt;...influence of genetics on sex roles. Lorber's book is a 302-page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(plus 100 pages of citations) exercise in sociological skepticism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delineating the parts of it for which there is strong evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they are are culturally-invented and not genetically encoded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Judy Mann also recently wrote a book on how to raise a child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without using some of these cultural constructions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This represents the contribution that gender theory can make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to transhumanist endeavor--helping to educate and empower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans to resist some of these cultural control mechanisms so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they can truly pursue their potential.  Can we agree on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that much?
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't yet read these books, and so I can't yet agree whether
<BR>
they do these things.
