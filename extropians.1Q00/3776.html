<P>&quot;Some men, you just can't reach&quot;.

<EM> &gt; Freezing is largely nondissipative.  Cracked and displaced

<P>No. Disagree strongly here. Though not having to bear burden of proof,
<BR>
provided things go as expected I will nevertheless document this
<BR>
extensively. You can't improve a process if you don't have a quality
<BR>
metric.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; surfaces, furthermore, leave around a large amount of information
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on matching surfaces, like a jigsaw puzzle. Thus for freezing
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not regard the cracks a problem at all. Nor do I share this
<BR>
peculiar specialist blindness.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; damage Merkle's analysis may be too *pessimistic*: we can often use
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
This is a joke, no?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; pattern matching rather than the computationally more expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cryptanalysis/machine learing techniques.  Ischemic damage
</EM><BR>
<P>The cryptoanalysis analogy is btw perfectly valid if you attempt to
<BR>
reconstruct the real thing by monitoring operation (say, using 10^9
<BR>
nanoprobes in vivo), especially if including manipulative measures
<BR>
(exciting subsystems and analyzing their activity dynamics).
<BR>
<P>It's just that a lot of people will die, perhaps all of us here
<BR>
present, if we wait for the advent of this technology (if it indeed
<BR>
arrives, which is far from being guaranteed). Nor is sustainability of
<BR>
patient storage guaranteed. As in every small market, customer (your)
<BR>
attitude matters.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; is another matter.  It involves quite dissipative chemical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; reactions.  There is good reason to believe that freezing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; damaging will be vastly easier to correct than ischemic damage.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Disagree here also. Ischaemic damage is synergistic, however, because
<BR>
it inhibits or prevents altogether the loading of tissue with
<BR>
cryoprotectants. Such a small issue, eh?
<BR>
<P>If you thought that typical cryonics patients look bad, don't even try
<BR>
to look at straight freeze. Ugh.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; The good news is that hypothermic conditions, for example
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hypothermic surgery, have been observed to prevent ischemia
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for hours at a time.  Unfortuneately good hypothermic
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, there are magic drugs, and there are advanced methods (partial
<BR>
liquid ventilation with fluorocarbons, which uses the lung as
<BR>
efficient heat exchanger allowing cooling rates better than invasive
<BR>
measures like peritoneal lavage).
<BR>
<P>Such new drugs and novel methods are not widely deployed in medical
<BR>
practice, and will not be used on patients considered hopeless or
<BR>
already dead. Suspensions under controlled conditions are _not_ the
<BR>
norm. Your stainless steel bracelet does not guarantee salvation.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; conditions are often absent.  Prevention of ischemic damage
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; needs much further study and higher priority in cryonics procedures.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
No, ischaemia is being adequately addressed, also (especially,
<BR>
considering the resources) by the mainstream. Brain vitrification is
<BR>
not.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Another piece of good news (for cryonics!) is that ischemic damage
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is a very common event, for example stroke, that the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has to some extent evolved to protect against, for example
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; through redundant storage of long term memories.  Brain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; damage from stroke is usually the result of loss of function
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of parts of the brain the function of which is to retrieve
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and process long term memories, rather than loss of the long
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; term memories themselves.  So after even a major stroke
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lasting for days the information is usually still there.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Stroke=focal damage. Ichaemia is global stroke. But again, ischaemia
<BR>
itself is not a primary source of damage, if patient in optimal
<BR>
settings, including premedication. Even postmedication stretches the
<BR>
window a lot, and we're not talking merely structural preservation but
<BR>
viability. I am not concerned about viability, the usual gold
<BR>
standard, but structural conservation only.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; These are all testable claims and it would be great to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; discuss studies on hypothermia, stroke, etc. rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; continue to speculate.  There also needs to be more
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to tried minimizing speculation on my part. However, I've seen
<BR>
that a lot of my arguments are being either ignored, dismissed or
<BR>
misunderstood. I am beginning to see the origins of that often voiced
<BR>
source of irritation.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; cross-disciplinary learning between computer scientists and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cryobiologists.
</EM><BR>
<P>Alas, so far information flow has been negligeable.
