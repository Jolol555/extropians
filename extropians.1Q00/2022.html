<EM>&gt; I had a similar idea about cops who violated suspects' rights.  Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letting the suspect go free on a technicality, I propose that we go ahead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and prosecute the suspect in a court of law.  Then we also prosecute the
</EM><BR>
cop
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for violating the suspects' rights.  Two different crimes, and two
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt; trials.  One alleged crime does not influence the judgement of the other.

<P>I'm not sure if I agree, but Harvey was not the first I know to suggest
<BR>
this.  Robert James Bindinotto suggested this several years ago in _The
<BR>
Freeman_ (the magazine, not the book) in a three part series on crime.  (He
<BR>
has a web page at: <A HREF="http://www.ios.org/info/sbrbidi.asp">http://www.ios.org/info/sbrbidi.asp</A>)  His argument was
<BR>
much the same.
<BR>
<P>Still, I do think law enforcement agents and members of the court who do
<BR>
violate procedural rights -- rights such as that due process as opposed to
<BR>
more fundamental rights such as that of self-defense -- should not go
<BR>
unpunished.  Of course, a big problem in our culture is few really see
<BR>
procedural rights as all that important -- at least, not in any justifiable
<BR>
way.  (Claims like &quot;It's in the US Constitution&quot; are only appeals to
<BR>
authority -- not a valid form of justification.)
<BR>
<P>Quo vadis?
