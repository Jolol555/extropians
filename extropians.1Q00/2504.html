<EM>&gt; Following up on the crypto angle, there's also a technology called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;group&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; signatures, which requires a group of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or some subset) to work together to create a signature.  Years ago I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested the ultimate democracy, Anything Boxes which would only create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objects which were signed by a threshold signature meaning that (say)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 80% of the human race approved that design.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
That's a good take on it. Or just a signature system that's open to
<BR>
public authentication and relies on enough people agreeing that the source
<BR>
to some new object is clean.
<BR>
<P>Trouble is, how do you make a system that can cope appropriately with
<BR>
a group like, say, Aum Shinryko, membership in the tens of thousands, who
<BR>
want to immanetize the eschaton (by building grey goo), without denying,
<BR>
say, smaller groups like, say, Alcor, membership somewhat smaller,
<BR>
who want to build their ressurect-o-mat(TM) (for all the corpsicles in
<BR>
their freezer)?
<BR>
<P>This is a political issue as much as it is a cryptographic one. Access to
<BR>
nanotechnology fabricators will be, to the next century, as fundamental
<BR>
issue as access to the means of production appeared to be in the 19th
<BR>
century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think Drexler first proposed the idea of the &quot;limited assembler&quot; back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Engines, something which would make consumer and industrial devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but wouldn't make super-dangerous things.  (Obviously even something as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple as a baseball bat can be used to club someone, unless it's a pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damn smart bat.)  Along with that he proposed a centimeter-sized isolation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lab where you could build anything you want, but it couldn't get out.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is how new designs would be tested and approved.
</EM><BR>
<P>And a good idea it is -- as long as there are no back doors in the system
<BR>
other than fail-safe ones. (A back door that lets anyone fry the contents
<BR>
of a test lab is fail-safe; it's annoying and may cost you money, or make
<BR>
you vulnerable to denial of service, but it doesn't risk an outbreak. A
<BR>
back door that lets you get things _out_ of the cell  defeats the whole
<BR>
purpose. And there will almost certainly be at least one idiot out there
<BR>
who likes the idea of having access to whatever's in their pocket lab,
<BR>
and who will _try_ to build or obtain a compromised one. Because people, 
<BR>
in the mass, are dumb.)
<BR>
<P>However.
<BR>
<P>I still believe that a mature nanotechnology that follows a closed-source
<BR>
model is going to be hacked, left right and centre. The perceived benefits
<BR>
of such hacking are too high, and the lack of flexibility in a system
<BR>
that can only build designs from one source is going to be an irritant
<BR>
to precisely the kind of low-budget imaginative amateurs who traditionally
<BR>
provided both the best hackers and the seeds of garage start-up ventures.
<BR>
Plus, a top-down security model is vulnerable to the top of the pyramid 
<BR>
being hijacked (for example, by an irresponsible government).
