&quot;Given the total indifference to human suffering displayed by the almighty, 
<BR>
`playing God' involves twiddling one's thumbs while millions die in extreme 
<BR>
agony from horrible diseases.  All this `putting an end to human 
<BR>
suffering'is surely the work of the devil.&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have pondered over this many times, myself.  As a believer it bothers me 
<BR>
more then it might an atheist.  A Mormon apologist might say that even a 
<BR>
long lifespan is a blink of an eye to God.  We will look back on things in 
<BR>
the next life and remember our suffering as learning experiences and be even 
<BR>
more grateful for a glorious and perfected resurrected body to spend 
<BR>
eternity in.
<BR>
<P>Mormons believe that a big part of the test in this life is the simple 
<BR>
horrendous fact that life is so unfair.  It is what we each make of what we 
<BR>
have and whether we get bitter toward God or have faith and do our best to 
<BR>
improve our lot and that of others around us, that is the big challenge.  
<BR>
Religious belief has motivated many people through history to reach out and 
<BR>
try to help others, sometimes dedicating whole lives to this, even though it 
<BR>
meant poverty and a shortened life.  Could this be God's way of reaching out 
<BR>
to help ease the suffering?
<BR>
<P>So much of what I see in the world enrages me.  When I study history I am 
<BR>
horrified by all the ignorance, poverty, war and disease that devastated 
<BR>
families and nations.  Some of it people knowingly brought upon themselves 
<BR>
but much of it was out of their control.  And right as of this moment in 
<BR>
time, to a great extent these evils still exist and inflict grievous 
<BR>
suffering on countless millions.
<BR>
<P>The petty things may actually bother me the most.  The way life is so unfair 
<BR>
with a relative few being considered &quot;physically attractive&quot; and getting the 
<BR>
attention.  I go occasionally to church dances where I see the plain looking 
<BR>
girls being ignored.  I dance with them but sometimes feel self-conscious 
<BR>
about it.  And the people who ignore them are supposed to be such fine 
<BR>
Christ-centered folks.  I see evolutionary psychology in action.
<BR>
<P>I wish I had all the answers, which I don't.  We have brains which allow us 
<BR>
to learn and master the world around us and we must do it to make this 
<BR>
planet a better place for human beings to live.  I think this is the 
<BR>
greatest gift we have.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
