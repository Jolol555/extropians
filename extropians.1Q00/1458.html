<EM>&gt; I think someone - I forget who - may have been right on when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointed out that in ordinary fields, patents are needed to promote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment, and are usually unambiguous and fair.  In software, the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that any further spur to investment is needed is absurd, and the patent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system is totally broken.  So I'd definitely be in favor of a total,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outright ban on software patents.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can you judge how much of the current investment level is due to the
<BR>
existence of patents, and therefore how much would be lost if software
<BR>
patents were eliminated?  You suggest that no further spur is needed,
<BR>
but after all the present system already includes patents.  No one is
<BR>
proposing to add more innovation by introducing software patents; we
<BR>
already have them.  The question is whether eliminating patents would
<BR>
reduce innovation, and if so, how much.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately software patents started being issued in the late 1970s or
<BR>
early 1980s, which was about the time that the &quot;software industry&quot; as we
<BR>
know it came into existence.  We don't have much independent experience
<BR>
with how the software world would look free of patent protection.
<BR>
It's not clear how relevant the 1960s are as a model.
