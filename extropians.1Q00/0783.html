<P>
Here's a discussion of a trick question you're likely to encounter.
<BR>
==
<BR>
If anyone raises the question of immortal souls, &quot;Why call them back
<BR>
from heaven?&quot; and all that, don't attack religion as a response.  People
<BR>
aren't going to suddenly stop believing because you tell them to.  At
<BR>
most, you might dare to sound unsure about the existence of souls; most
<BR>
people will accept that you might have doubts because they have doubts
<BR>
themselves, but they won't accept an atheist.
<BR>
<P>The correct trick answer to &quot;What about immortal souls?&quot; is &quot;Well, even
<BR>
if we have immortal souls, that doesn't mean we're living long enough. 
<BR>
We could still live longer, and for that matter, live free of old age in
<BR>
the time that we have.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If they say that we don't need to live longer, that the time we have is
<BR>
enough, that further extension is unnatural, point out that we already
<BR>
live past threescore-and-ten, that we still don't have enough time to
<BR>
learn and grow and fulfill our potential, and that this is the line of
<BR>
thought that leads to banning reading glasses and polio vaccines.  &quot;Do
<BR>
you really think God objects to our trying to improve our lot on this Earth?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Whether you want to raise the question of true Greg-Egan-style
<BR>
immortality, in the sense of not dying, ever, even after the Universe
<BR>
collapses in on itself or freezes over, would be another question.  You
<BR>
might want to mention the possibility, although not argue it, to point
<BR>
up that your own position is actually milder.  &quot;I've heard schemes for
<BR>
genuine immortality, technologies that would let us actually outlive the
<BR>
Universe.  That's what immortality means, to quote Greg Egan.  Not
<BR>
'dying after a very long time'.  Just not dying, period.  But I'm just
<BR>
talking about life extension, not immortality, so the questions about
<BR>
souls and true immortality don't arise.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
<BR>
<P>Yours in Singularity,
<BR>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.
