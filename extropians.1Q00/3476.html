Qualia Schmalia...here's news for nerds
<BR>
<P>Check your links to BBC On-line sci/tech!
<BR>
<P>Scientists at the US Department of Energy's national security facility have 
<BR>
created a micro-machine etched from amorphous diamond, the hardest material 
<BR>
in the world after crystalline diamond. 
<BR>
<P>The methods used were the same as those used with current silicon chip 
<BR>
manufacturing techniques. 
<BR>
<P>The first diamond micro-machine is a comb drive whose tiny teeth move forward 
<BR>
and back as an electrical current reverses constantly between positive and 
<BR>
negative. The teeth are just two thousandths of a millimetre apart. 
<BR>
<P>The researchers, at the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, say 
<BR>
diamond has a number of valuable properties. 
<BR>
<P>Resistant to wear 
<BR>
<P>Its resistance to wear makes diamond ideal for micro-machines that need to 
<BR>
function for extended periods of time. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;One estimate in the literature claims that diamond should last 10,000 times 
<BR>
longer than polysilicon,&quot; said group member Tom Friedmann.

<BR>
Also, diamond is less susceptible to &quot;stiction&quot; than silicon. Stiction - a 
<BR>
combination of stickiness and friction - can render micro-machines useless. 
<BR>
This is because silicon is attracted to water, which acts as a kind of glue. 
<BR>
Diamond does not have the same problem. 
<BR>
<P>Another advantage is that diamond is biologically benign. A micro-machine 
<BR>
such as a tiny drug dispensing unit could be used in the body without 
<BR>
triggering an allergic reaction. 
<BR>
<P>There are two kinds of diamond, crystalline and amorphous. The Sandia 
<BR>
researchers used amorphous diamond because crystalline diamond needs far 
<BR>
higher temperatures to synthesise it, and also its surface roughness makes it 
<BR>
unsuitable for micro-machines. 
<BR>
<P>Amorphous diamond itself had been impractical because its tremendous internal 
<BR>
stresses had made it impossible for the material to stand alone or to coat 
<BR>
thickly any but the strongest surfaces. 
<BR>
<P>However, a process developed by Friedmann and Sullivan eliminated that 
<BR>
problem. 
<BR>
<P>Silicon MEMs (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) are already used in a variety 
<BR>
of applications, ranging from air bags in cars to optical micro-mirrors 
<BR>
intended for possible deployment on satellites. 
<BR>
<P>It's hoped that diamond MEMs could eventually offer a harder wearing and more 
<BR>
flexible alternative, and in the future could replace silicon micro-machines 
<BR>
completely.
