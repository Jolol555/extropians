<EM>&gt; Maybe I'm dense, but it seems to me that if the attacker has *replicating*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bots, your shield would have to be so tight as to prevent even a single
</EM><BR>
bot
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from getting through your defenses.  Because if just *one* gets through,
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; can fairly quickly become billions.  And then you are in trouble, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>That would only be true if you were trying to put a hollow shield around an
<BR>
undefended lump of resources.  In reality your shield would not be hollow,
<BR>
so sneaking past the perimeter doesn't make an intruder safe.  It has
<BR>
another chance at being detected every time a sensor bot happens by, which
<BR>
is likely to happen many times per second.  Also, keep in mind that nanobot
<BR>
replication takes a lot longer than a duel between two nanobots (probably
<BR>
tens of seconds vs. milliseconds), so it can't expect to manufacture
<BR>
reinforcements quickly enough to make much difference.
<BR>
<P>Defending inert matter, or even appropriately designed macro-scale
<BR>
machinery, isn't a big deal.  The hard problem is defending delicate,
<BR>
hard-to-upgrade territory like a human body.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And how would you possibly build a shield so tight that not a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacker could get through without turning every available atom into part
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; your shield?
</EM><BR>
<P>A thick wall of any reasonably inert material, watched by a sensor/repair
<BR>
network capable of detecting millimeter-scale activity, should do the job
<BR>
quite nicely.  After all, a nanobot can't carry enough onboard energy to
<BR>
dissassemble any significant amount of matter unless the reactions involved
<BR>
are exothermic.
<BR>
<P>Don't fall into the trap of thinking that all problems must be solved using
<BR>
nanobots.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That seems like a big if.  How can you be confident that the &quot;good guys&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have such a huge disparity in their favor?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a necessary consequence of the assumption that the intruders will be
<BR>
undetected until they reach you.  A diffuse cloud of drifting bots might
<BR>
sneak up on you, but a dense swarm of them is easy to spot.  If you can see
<BR>
them coming you can kill virtually all of them with macro-scale weapons,
<BR>
leaving only a few ragged survivors for your nanobots to fight.
