<P>&lt;&lt;This is sounding very STNG'y.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;What are the basic rules ?
<BR>
&nbsp;- - respect something for what it is and the way it is, and discard ideas of
<BR>
&nbsp;superiority and non-superiority ? things are less capable and less aware and
<BR>
&nbsp;less skilled or more capable and more aware and more skilled; or just
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;different&quot;.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that there is some truth to the above statement, but that as 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
maximum level of awareness something is capable of decreases, so does how 
<BR>
much 
<BR>
respect we have to have for its current state.  To me, much more significant 
<BR>
than 
<BR>
what something is and the way it is is how it wants to be.  Of course, this 
<BR>
is a 
<BR>
subjective quality, so difficult to ascertain.  However, I believe it is 
<BR>
worth the trouble 
<BR>
to attempt to infer from something's behavior (especially in the form of 
<BR>
communication).  Great Apes, in my opinion, are capable of having quite high 
<BR>
levels 
<BR>
of desire, and thus should be respected and given their rights.  Chairs and 
<BR>
rocks 
<BR>
have no desires as far as I can ascertain, though both may receive some 
<BR>
protection if 
<BR>
a more complex system (like a human being) desires them to be that way.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; - - do not disturb these things from what they are doing, even if they are
<BR>
&nbsp;incorrectly disturbing other things, or possibly guide and educate them to
<BR>
&nbsp;greater levels of awareness ? but even this suggests the primacy of &quot;greater
<BR>
&nbsp;levels of awareness&quot; as a positive outcome from our perspective, not from
<BR>
&nbsp;theirs ? perhaps, their perspective is to operate a destructive system, who
<BR>
&nbsp;says that a productive one is more important ?&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This touches on the question of creation versus improvement.  Are you 
<BR>
really 
<BR>
helping a pre-existent entity or are you creating a new entity?  It's a 
<BR>
difficult question 
<BR>
to answer.  I will wimp out on answering that one for the moment, as I am 
<BR>
still trying 
<BR>
to understand it myself.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; - - somehow provide enough communication to them so that when they become
<BR>
&nbsp;aware enough to look out and modify themselves to undertake self change, or
<BR>
&nbsp;whatever, then there are helping hands that will help them ?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;It's a pity I don't drink, or I would need one now. No, I am not on mind
<BR>
&nbsp;altering substances. Though I can relate some interesting stories of
<BR>
&nbsp;spiritual journeys on early mornings in Paris ... very strange.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Help !
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Matthew. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I will say this much.  I would venture to guess that if a system 
<BR>
never has 
<BR>
desires about itself unless you significantly change its structure, then you 
<BR>
are 
<BR>
creating a new being, and thus the question should be asked, &quot;Is this 
<BR>
non-sentient 
<BR>
object the best material to be building a sentient being out of?&quot;  However, 
<BR>
if the 
<BR>
system has desires about itself without significant alteration from you, then 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
question is, &quot;How can I best help this sentient being?&quot;  It is really kind of 
<BR>
a small 
<BR>
difference if viewed from the perspective that you are trying to in future 
<BR>
ensure that all 
<BR>
sentient beings you have influenced benefit as much as possible from 
<BR>
interacting 
<BR>
with you.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I'm obviously not awake yet....that's enough babbling for now&lt;G&gt;.
