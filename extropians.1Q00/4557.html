<P>
I had an interesting day.  I went to a presentation(part of a series running 
<BR>
the semester) that dealt with cutting edge science involving complex 
<BR>
systems.  A UAA professor who is Russian (barely decent english but VERY 
<BR>
smart) spoke about the biochemistry involved in the earliest evolution of 
<BR>
life and focused on studies to simulate through computer or chemistry a 
<BR>
living cell.  He talked of the current project to actually create life.
<BR>
<P>It was funny seeing a math professor who was used to 'clean and neat' 
<BR>
mathematics(just my opinion) and had trouble grasping the 'messy' complex 
<BR>
interactions of biochemistry but then it was not his specialty.  He simply 
<BR>
kept on asking questions till he got it.  I never totally did! Most of it 
<BR>
flew over my head since the seminars though open to all, are really for the 
<BR>
postdoctorate hard science crowd.
<BR>
<P>But I grasped a little of it and enjoyed talking to the russian prof 
<BR>
afterward about whether he thought their was life spread throughout the 
<BR>
galaxy.  He joked that there must be since so many people report seeing 
<BR>
UFO's!  I replied that the people at Seti would take offense at that!  He 
<BR>
didn't quite catch the Seti reference so I explained how they used radio 
<BR>
telescopes and disliked the 'flying saucer' crowd that said every 
<BR>
Saturday-night the aliens would abduct them.  That got a big laugh from the 
<BR>
crowd.
<BR>
<P>I enjoyed listening to a biology professor afterward, (with the Max More 
<BR>
ponytail thing going!) who explained how it is so hard for humans to 
<BR>
conceive of the prelife earth because conditions were so different then and 
<BR>
now the biosphere permeates everything.  He said the earth must had a great 
<BR>
deal of protein then and proper conditions to nurture it and he could not 
<BR>
understand how some scientists consider life forming on the earth as such a 
<BR>
lucky roll of the dice.  He felt it was bound to happen.
<BR>
<P>I regret having missed all the previous presentations so far.  They were 
<BR>
about, let's see.. turing machines and computation, early microbial life, 
<BR>
the lyganov exponent and sexual selection, replicating automata, the origins 
<BR>
of social hierarchies and the simplicity in complex systems.  I complain 
<BR>
about being to far away from Extro's and then don't attend these meetings in 
<BR>
my own hometown!  I could have learned so much.  I must get my act together.
<BR>
<P>The remaining presentation's will be about complexity in the field of 
<BR>
history, complex weather systems, and then two open forums, one about the 
<BR>
future of our species and the other about the future of the universe.  I 
<BR>
will absolutely be at those two concluding meetings.  It will be interesting 
<BR>
to see to what extent they take a transhumanist bent.  Maybe I can influence 
<BR>
that.  Or perhaps during the Friday morning it happens, one of you could fly 
<BR>
up here to give your views! lol  To go that far far you might as well be the 
<BR>
speaker.  But UAA prof's can be an ornery crowd!!
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
