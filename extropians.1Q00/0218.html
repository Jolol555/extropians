<EM>&gt; Robert Bradbury
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would hate to see us move from organizations involved in rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;educational discussions to organizations with &quot;platforms&quot;.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;platforms do serve a purpose of condensing a lot of in the trenches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion into a form that can be easily communicated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Meaning: platforms allow complex networks of ideas and information to
<BR>
be reduced to a three-second sound bite whose value is proportional
<BR>
mainly to its provocativeness and thus, often, its
<BR>
ostentatiousness.  There's a difference between ease of communication
<BR>
and submission to unreasonable restrictions of major media outlets and
<BR>
the average voter's attention span.  Platforms allow ossification of
<BR>
dynamic philosophical and scientific positions which, being
<BR>
scientific, demand fluidity and eschew dogmatism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;economics&quot; creep in when you actually get into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the details of how to implement these moral values and courses of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;action.
</EM><BR>
<P>I---to my surprise, I must say---have been more attentive to the very
<BR>
noticable growing interest in and concern about transhumanism in the
<BR>
public arena.  I realize that some people here have long been active
<BR>
in what could be considered &quot;political&quot; work promoting or defending
<BR>
transhumanism.  And the public is certainly becoming more aware of the
<BR>
ideas.  But I have never had confidence in politicians or journalists,
<BR>
to name a few, to determine the playing field, the rules, or the goals
<BR>
for earnest discussion or development.
<BR>
<P>Robert has enough concern about this to place quotes around the main
<BR>
terms; but I doubt that the quoted (and thus weaker) terms are
<BR>
ultimately very different than those normally used.  Large portions of
<BR>
your audience may not know what a &quot;platform&quot; is.  They know what a
<BR>
platform is, however, and even if you manage to personally dissociate
<BR>
the two in your own work _Time_, Katie Couric, and friends will
<BR>
probably not perceive or allow the distinction.
