Who's asking Robert Owen to give E. Shaun Russell a &quot;break&quot;?  I looked
<BR>
back over previous messages.  As far as I can tell, Shaun made an
<BR>
interesting point about the necessity for saying &quot;maybe&quot;; even the Sun
<BR>
rising tomorrow can be qualified.  *I* was impressed by his brilliance,
<BR>
or at least I accepted it as part of the general smartness often found
<BR>
in Extropians.  Precision is important.
<BR>
<P>I find Robert Owen's implication that he is somehow in a position to
<BR>
&quot;judge&quot; Owen - that he in a position of greater social authority or
<BR>
reputation, with the associated connotation that he is automatically
<BR>
right and Shaun is automatically wrong because of their respective ages
<BR>
- to be unacceptable as a rational argument, and not really very
<BR>
acceptable as social behavior, either.  Shaun has been on the list
<BR>
longer than I have.  My social instincts say that he's in a position to
<BR>
judge Owen, not vice versa.
<BR>
<P>I'm not quite sure why everybody seems to be treading so softly around
<BR>
Robert Owen.  Perhaps he has some outside-the-list authority of which I
<BR>
am unaware; after all, I've yet to make it to an Extropy convention. 
<BR>
But unless this particular conversation has been going on for longer
<BR>
than the single exchange I caught - which seems likely, because
<BR>
otherwise things are getting a bit disproportionate - it looks to me
<BR>
like Shaun, the senior member of this list, was walking along minding
<BR>
his own business when Owen walked up behind him and hit him with a mallet.
<BR>
<P>Okay, I'm done.
