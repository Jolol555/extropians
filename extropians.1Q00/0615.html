<P>In a few years you will see this move to the next well known state of, &quot;Well

yes, we knew this all along.&quot;  What I have experienced in the last 8 years of
<BR>
watching (and helping) the development of Foresight is that sooner or later
<BR>
each researcher that spends enough thought to look outside of his or her field
<BR>
to get the necessary breadth to understand the big picture, gets hooked.  I
<BR>
have never seen one go back.

<P>I remember very well the day I went to my mailbox and received the Scientific
<BR>
American issue that had the cheap shot article by Gary Styx, in which he
<BR>
portrayed Eric as a flake.  I can tell you I was deeply hurt.  If Eric were a
<BR>
flake, this would have sunk him.  But instead it caused all of us who felt hurt
<BR>
to stand and fight with Ralph, who put together the counter attack on the Web,
<BR>
and turned it around.  Now Eric's work is sited in an increasing number of
<BR>
'regular' scientific publications every year.  You should go ahead and do so.
