<P><EM>&gt;I don't think you have a clear picture of the economy you live in.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure you're right. I don't get out much.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All those salesfolk and skyscrapers are not mainly there to move stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from factories to your home, or even to design the things the factories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make.  They perform lots of other useful functions. 
</EM><BR>
<P>What, though, when all is said and done? 
<BR>
<P>Most of the work in the world that *interests* me most (high energy physics
<BR>
and astronomy and like that) is parasitic on low and high-level
<BR>
life-support toil. Yes, it has some spin-offs that feed back into
<BR>
productivity and ultimately into those paradigm-jumpers that will push us
<BR>
into the singularity, but meanwhile it looks as if many of the smart people
<BR>
in the world have set it up so the less smart provide their sustenance
<BR>
while they enjoy the exercise of their wits. Perhaps I digress. 
<BR>
<P>My question is, what economic functions must be performed in those
<BR>
skyscrapers when and if we have a combination of positional synthesisers
<BR>
and human-level AI (not necessarily conscious, but the kind of thing that
<BR>
happens due to Moore's curve, by general consensus in 20-40 years.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;With AI agents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;taking over most of the scut-work of filing and organizing 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Assuming advanced AI is very different from just assuming early nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>But hang on, you've snipped my key linking statement, where I claimed:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But of course this assumes bizarrely that *only* replicative nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens in the future.  Moore's Law hasn't shut down, the computers are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;getting better all the time, and nano is feeding into that curve with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smaller and faster computers built at molecular scales 
</EM><BR>
<P>So I assume any disagreement involves timelines for these innovations.
<BR>
Which is where we came in.
<BR>
<P>I'd lwelcome opinions of how long it's likely to take to go from early
<BR>
assemblers to smart computers using nano construction and operating
<BR>
principles?
