<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330051253.59010.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I addressed this earlier too.  You know, (1) it doesn't matter who's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the system as long as its sufficiently and verifiably transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is false.  Transparency is not enough.  You need transparency, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capacity to recognize wrongdoing, and the capacity to do something about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.
</EM><BR>
<P>None of these requirements seems like much of a hurdle in a transparent 
<BR>
society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (2) the web analogy (&quot;tons of data, hardly any data crunching&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LOTS of data-crunching, you just forget it's going on.  Can you imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system like this if it depended on human agents to type in what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras were seeing?
</EM><BR>
<P>The point is that its not going on by *my* machine.  The crunching is being 
<BR>
done on the server.  My box just reads the results to me, no big deal.  As a 
<BR>
result I don't need to invest in a big powerful server to benefit from the 
<BR>
data on the web.  Government, with all its fancy shmancy hardware can't do 
<BR>
anything on the web I can't do.  This undercuts your &quot;the big guys will make 
<BR>
better use of it so they can crush you&quot; argument.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (3)  government-civilian oversight committees, etc., etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which become decreasingly likely as it gets easier and easier to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;despot.
</EM><BR>
<P>*If* it gets easier to be a despot.  You have not said anything to make 
<BR>
believe that this is the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sure I might be worried about that if I lived someplace other than the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;US or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sometime other than 2000 a.d.  But the fact of the matter is that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plan to take over the US and overturn our democratic republic you will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to (1) control the military and (2) somehow convince the military to (a)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attack their friends and families and (b) do away with the civil 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;liberties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that we as a society have fought and died to preserve for over 200 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all for the privilege of being able to call you King.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How would you *possibly* do that?  How could you possibly form the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;military,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; economic and strategic alliances necessary to accomplish that ludicrous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in a transparent society without somebody getting wind of what you're up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and ruining your party?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You start small and work outwards.  Despotism is a tiring, thankless job,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but at the end of the day, you've got a personal realm of terror that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can call your own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For the curious, you do it like this:  You seize control of a small area,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  (Whoops!  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras aren't lie detectors, are they?)  You seize control of some more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;territory, and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  Repeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Granted, I left out the hard part, which is actually seizing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;territory, but the principle is tried and true.  And unfortunately, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras can't detect intentions any better than the modern press.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that the act of &quot;seizing&quot; *any* territory in the US makes you a 
<BR>
criminal and the feds will swiftly give you an extra large helping of the 
<BR>
Montana Freeman - Branch Davidian treatment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Despotism doesn't, at any step of the picture, rely on secrecy in any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;whatsoever.  On the contrary, perfect transparency is in the despot's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;interests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What?!?  Are you kidding??  How long do you think Saddam Hussein would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in power in a transparent society?  I'll tell you, approximately 2 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is an empirical point of which I may not be able to convince you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, suffice it to say that I'm confident enough that right thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people will see that you're wrong that I may not want to devote much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time to arguing the point.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, can't force you to prove your point.  Especially since you have all the 
<BR>
&quot;right thinking&quot; people on your side.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The despot keeps the populace in constant fear because they never know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to trust because your neighbor might be one of the despot's secret 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; henchmen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No need to fear THAT, per se: any action whatsoever which the despotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government finds unacceptable can and will be punished accordingly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why do you think every oppressive, despotic government *always*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *ALWAYS* has a secret police.  Why do you think that establishing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; police is one of the *first* things a totalitarian government does?  Why 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you think they call secret police &quot;secret?&quot;  How would you set up a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;secret&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; police force in a *transparent* society?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Golly.  I have no idea.  What DO they keep a secret?  What good does that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do them, exactly?  What would they lose by having an openly well-armed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thug police?  Oh, right.  It's the difference b/w totalitarianism, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moral theory, and despotism, the fact of the matter.  Well, the point is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subtle.  The fact that the government can no longer plausibly claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are acting in the best interests of the citizens isn't much of a loss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so long as the ruler remains threatening.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;That way you can be quite confident that when the despot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;claims that he'll squash you like a bug, he *really will* squash you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;a bug.  Knowing that someone is a despot does not help you get rid of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;despot in any way whatsoever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure, but knowing who his sympathizers are and who the opposition is, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the fact that the opposition outnumbers the despot and his henchmen will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; give you a hint as to what to do to regain your freedom, don't ya think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As if all you needed were numbers.  You need weapons, too.  And you need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to organize.  But if you try to get a weapon, the henchmen will know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instantly, and shoot you.  And if you try to organize, before you get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chance, the government will know instantly, and shoot you.  THAT'S how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;picture looks when transparency goes both ways but only one side has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physical force and the computing power on its side.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK now look at it this way, for all the reasons you just said it would be 
<BR>
difficult to overthrow a despot if he had access to ubiquitous surveillance. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those same reasons, it would be just as hard (if not harder) for 
<BR>
the despot to take over in the first place.
<BR>
