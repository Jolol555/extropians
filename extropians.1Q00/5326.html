<P><EM>&gt; I listened to the show.  What can I say?  I'm starting to believe that Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just trying to make a name for himself in the eyes of the public is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lone voice of reason in the issue.  I can certainly sympathize with his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concern about the potential pitfalls of GNR, but I think he's being a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;over the top&quot; in his characterizations of the risks.

<P>It is just one more example of sun trying to win by restricting competition.
<BR>
The conversation in Sun's board room goes like:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Shit, those quantum entanglement computers might make Solaris look like the
<BR>
crap it is. How can we stop them?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Just grab a copy of FreeBSD 4 and forget about Sun. The rest of the world
<BR>
soon will.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Worst, he doesn't offer *any* solution.
</EM><BR>
Of course, not. The socialist leader must never speak the solution - voice
<BR>
only the problem and then you get assent (who cares about subsequent
<BR>
consent: Assent is all you need to take control).
<BR>
<P>If Bill were to specify the solution (global control over every thinking
<BR>
persons behavior to prevent them by force from using any nanotech devices
<BR>
[think Vernor Vinge's &quot;The Peace-Wars&quot;]) then he would foster immediate
<BR>
dissent, as he has in this group (because we most us are capable of thinking
<BR>
through consequences for our selves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to say &quot;Hey Bill, shut the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hell up!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Nah - just say: &quot;get your hands out of my life: NOW!&quot;

killed by illegal drugs, estimated at 5,212.&quot;
