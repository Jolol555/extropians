<EM>&gt; John,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes I do have a lot of catching up to do. Let's see 450 email messages...hmmm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let me see here...hmmm it says half are from you! ;)p LOL Well not really but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man you are the busiest beaver on the Extrop list. How are you doing? I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting around to sending you an individual message about being back but things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happened and you beat me to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am feeling well and there isn't much pain. I was sooo tired before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surgery. I have my days and nights turned around so the last time I slept was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the morning till the afternoon of Wednesday. That night I was awake as usual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unable t get to sleep anyway and trying to get messages out and read. Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thursday I couldn't sleep during the day because I had to go to the hospital for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pre-op check in and testing. Back home again I still couldn't sleep and had last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minute messages to go out. I stayed awake for the surgery and only had a spinal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; block and local anesthesia. After it was done around 11 am I went to my room and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; began to eat (hadn't eaten since 12 am the night before--the rules--got only two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bites of a sandwich) when they whisked me away to radiation therapy to irradiate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the knee to discourage re-growth of the errant bone material. Back to the room I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finally eat and wouldn't you know it I got my second, hmmm maybe third by now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wind! Later at 8 pm there was a movie with Extropian leanings I tried to watch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but by then I was finally too tired to put up with it's lame plot and backyard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wish there was a way to winnow some of the chaff from the list mailings. Such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as not in the area of extropianism or those less than 10 word responses an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially short stinging quips. How do you filter that stuff...you can't. Oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well....450 emails yet to go through. :(
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey how are you doing lately? Have you heard from your Aussie friend? Are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new meds working? Maybe so based on the level of your activity. You know as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read your posts I even more so find it difficult to convince myself of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disability in learning. Wish there was a way for you to earn a living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commentating. Well back to the grind. ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>John has my profound apology. The above was meant to be private. I had not
<BR>
noticed it was a list mailing. I thought he had emailed me directly. I in no way
<BR>
meant to share personal information, once intrusted to me, so freely on the
<BR>
Extropian list. I don't mind the information about me to be out there but I had
<BR>
no right to involve the list with personal matters regarding John. I assure you
<BR>
it was a gross mistake made from carlessness alone and certainly was not
<BR>
intended. That hardly lessens the consequence though. I'm so very sorry John.
<BR>
<P>James
