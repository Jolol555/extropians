<P>
Eliezer:
<BR>
<P>Please post my complete response to extropians.  I would prefer if in the
<BR>
future you do not post incomplete selections of my arguments to other
<BR>
lists.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Good%20exchange%20with%20Eliezer&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003291936440.36649-100000@squid.umd.edu&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I don't know if you're aware of this, but the atoms within the brain do
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not remain constant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Duh.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; So whatever &quot;we&quot; are, it's clearly not the atoms.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with this statement is that you are already investing a lot of
<BR>
potential meanings into the word &quot;we.&quot;  Each of us exists AT THE PRESENT
<BR>
MOMENT as a unique physical construction of atoms.  We have also the fact
<BR>
of continuous identity from birth to death.  This is a simple enough
<BR>
matter as long as you don't introduce all these bizarre scenarios we are
<BR>
talking about.  But as soon as you do, the &quot;continuity of identity&quot;
<BR>
becomes problematic.  Whereas the physical existence of a body, a brain,
<BR>
in some compact region of space-time, remains a fairly simple and
<BR>
unambiguous fact.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If you scan in one neuron at a time, destroy the old neuron, and replace
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it with a robotic interface to equivalent computations taking place
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; elsewhere, you can migrate, one neuron at a time, to the new substrate,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; without ever losing consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is Moravec's scenario; see my response to &quot;Max's argument&quot; on this
<BR>
list.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; In this case, would it not be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; possible to say that the new individual is unambiguously &quot;you&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<P>It is possible to say this, but that does not make it unambiguous.  For
<BR>
example, what if you make two copies simultaneously?  There is no apparent
<BR>
reason within this scenario why you can't make as many copies as you like.
<BR>
Which one, then is &quot;you&quot;?  What if two copies are made, and then one is
<BR>
scrapped?  Do &quot;you&quot; automatically become the one that remains, or is there
<BR>
a risk that &quot;you&quot; wind up dead?  What if 1,000,000 copies are made, and
<BR>
then 999,999 of them are scrapped?  Do &quot;you&quot; automatically become the one
<BR>
that was randomly chosen to survive?  How much difference would it make to
<BR>
&quot;you&quot; if all of the copies were scrapped?  Are &quot;you&quot; then left flying
<BR>
around in the void without a body to migrate to?  Or is this all just a
<BR>
bunch of superstitious nonsense?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; We discuss only the technical possibility.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you also construct a quasi-religion within which this technical
<BR>
possibility is made to seem humanly desirable.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; And yes, if you can move an identity into a computer, then you can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; create duplicates of the identity as well as moving it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you resort to the word &quot;identity,&quot; but you use it in exactly the same
<BR>
sense as others use the word &quot;spirit.&quot;  But what does the word &quot;identity&quot;
<BR>
mean, if there can be &quot;duplicates&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Your preconception
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the mysterious spirit requires that it not be subject to copying;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe in &quot;spirits&quot; (unless we use that term to mean actual,
<BR>
physical human beings).  But you apparently do:
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; you use the fact that a given technical procedure could copy a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; spirit
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not believe this &quot;fact.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; to prove by an alleged reductio ad absurdum that the same
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; technical procedure cannot move it, or that the process of moving only
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; creates a copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>What else does it do, besides making a copy?  In what sense is my
<BR>
description of the process as &quot;making a copy&quot; incomplete?  What THING
<BR>
&quot;moves&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If you replace one neuron at a time with a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; biologically equivalent neuron, or just wait a few years while the cells
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; metabolisms churn, you have moved the identity from one set of atoms to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; another.  If you replace one neuron at a time with a computational
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; equivalent, you have moved the identity from one set of atoms to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; another.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does such an &quot;identity&quot; look like?  Some kind of bluish light?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If you read out the information and create a functionally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; equivalent copy, you have created two identities, neither of which has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; any stronger claim to being the &quot;real you&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you're beginning to think.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; In short, your argument rests on a sleight-of-hand.
</EM><BR>
<P>Moravec's argument is sleight-of-hand.  Ditto Max More's.  And these guys
<BR>
have created an entire cult movement out of this gibberish.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; nondestructively copy all the information in the brain, creating a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; duplicate, then the impulse is strong to identify the original set of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; atoms as the &quot;real you&quot;, implying that the second set of atoms is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;fake you&quot; - and if a nondestructive upload &quot;merely creates a copy&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; then surely a destructive upload also &quot;merely creates a copy&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very good!
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; set of atoms maintain physical identity, and the other doesn't, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; temptation is very strong to say that the first set of atoms has a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; stronger claim to informational identity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Too much inflated jargon here, but again you are more or less on target.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; But this is a mere anthropomorphism.
</EM><BR>
<P>BINGO!  And just what sort of morphism are YOU, my friend?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If the informational equality is perfect - i.e., with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; margins of error substantially below the ordinary &quot;noise level&quot; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; brain's computational environment - then both sets of atoms have an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; equally strong claim to being the &quot;real you&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only because the claim is, in either case, meaningless!  Unless you
<BR>
allow the meaning that gives the claim to the &quot;original.&quot;  Which would be
<BR>
the anthropocentric thing to do.  Long live anthropocentrism!
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; They are both the original.  They are both copies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, except one is the original and the other is the copy.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The atoms are irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you say so.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Who says there's such a thing as an observer-independent definition of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; personal identity, anyway?
</EM><BR>
<P>Provided we do not introduce copying, there is no ambiguity in assigning a
<BR>
unique personal identity to each human life from birth to death.  But this
<BR>
is clearly a construction.  As soon as you introduce the possibility of
<BR>
copying, you do violence to this construction.  You unmask the void.  You
<BR>
reduce human life to an abstract, meaningless absurdity.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Uploading&quot; is nonsense.  It can be justified only in terms of a mystical
<BR>
faith in the implicit meaning of phrases like &quot;informational identity&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;algorithms of consciousness&quot; or &quot;you wake up in your new body.&quot;  If we
<BR>
look at what is going on from a materialistic viewpoint, we confront the
<BR>
horror of the void.  Indeed, the flip side of the &quot;transhumanist movement&quot;
<BR>
is sheer nihilism.
<BR>
<P>Yours,
<BR>
Mark
