<P>Eugene, someday you are just going to have to prove to me that you
<BR>
are a card-carrying Extropian.  Sometimes the things you say leave
<BR>
me doubting...
<BR>
<P>As I tried to indicate the market will take some time to develop.
<BR>
The California Y2004 laws for non-polluting fleet sales begin drive
<BR>
this forward.  Once you get the car volumes high enough, translating
<BR>
into low enough costs for fuel cells, then as the automobile fleet
<BR>
slowly gets replaced a market slowly develops.  Yes for the first 3-5
<BR>
years you still pump in gas/alcohol from your gas station.  But pretty
<BR>
soon the Agriculture industry wakes up to the fact that they can grow the
<BR>
fuel and do so (they do it now, but the market is still limited by
<BR>
the fuel consumption technology).  After that some bright entrepreneurs
<BR>
wake up to the fact that you can grow it at home.  Since one can see
<BR>
the path, then some bright folks will push the last step
<BR>
earlier in the process and you get Fuel@Home groups springing
<BR>
up around the country.
<BR>
<P>Your perspective regarding the difficulties for PhoMe is justified
<BR>
for today, but not in light of the path I've outlined above.   Some
<BR>
&quot;mandated&quot; requirements to drive fuel cell technology development is
<BR>
necessary.  Then the turnover time in automobile fleet replacement is a
<BR>
constraint.  The bacteria look difficult now, but in 10 years they will be
<BR>
easy and the development costs will be cheap (I've done the numbers --
<BR>
*unbelieveably* cheap).
<BR>
<P>The market development time will drive the fuel production methods.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And MeOH distribution infrastructure by then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be dominated by these previously in charge of it, i.e. abovesaid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Initially, no argument, but unless they get clever and get zoning
<BR>
restrictions on Fuel@Home, I don't see how they can stop it.  The Oil
<BR>
and Gas industries haven't stopped the installation of solar hot water
<BR>
in homes, but the penetration has been slow because the installation
<BR>
is still a labor intensive process and that makes the payback time long.
<BR>
The long payback times (10+ years?) really diminish the incentives
<BR>
to get the loan, manage the subcontractor, etc.
<BR>
<P>Fuel@Home is somewhat simpler because it doesn't have to be tied into
<BR>
the existing home infrastructure to the same degree.  What will
<BR>
make it fly is a kit that most do-it-yourselfers can install.
<BR>
Then you could see automobile suppliers providing the kits as part
<BR>
of the purchase package to make the sale a better &quot;deal&quot;.
<BR>
I suspect the average person annually spends 5-10 times as much on gas
<BR>
as they do on hot water, so if you can get the kit cost down to
<BR>
3-5x the average annual fuel bill I think its a no brainer.
<BR>
<P>Its worth noting that for many of the oil producing countries, though
<BR>
this dampens their revenue stream from depleting natural resources,
<BR>
many of them are relatively rich in land mass and renewable solar
<BR>
energy.  The question will be whether they build up their educated
<BR>
populations (engineers, etc.) to levels that are high enough that they
<BR>
can develop technologies that take advantage of this.
<BR>
