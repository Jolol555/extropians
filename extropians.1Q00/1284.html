<EM>&gt; I rather think so. Nicely summarised, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are some small difficulties in making it predictive rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retro-interpretative. Australian aboriginal cultures, arguably holding the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longest continuity in their belief structures of any living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans, did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a big god, and many of their ancestor `spirits' (or metaphysical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypostatisations, or something) were animals, boulders, etc. Most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constellations are primal animals, narrativised in anthropomorphic terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but clearly the birds and beasts of the important local ecologies: a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gigantic mnemonic and instructional system for a pre-literate hunter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gatherer lifestyle. I think this actually goes to support Greg's model, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mind-twitch that underlies it: our reflex to attribute motive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose to brute events in the world, especially those that are violent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crucial to life, or simply eye- and ear-catching - perhaps the basis also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore, of art and music.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool, I get to relate some speculation resulting from a class assignment on
<BR>
art, belief and experience in Maori culture taken last year. They, as with
<BR>
many primitive cultures, have an animistic view of the world, where all
<BR>
things have 'mana' (spiritual essence), and some things are 'tapu'
<BR>
(forbidden, or must be 'accessed' according to taught procedures). The
<BR>
procedures and rules are taught by elders, effectively the high priests. If
<BR>
you do not act in accordance to these social rules, then you incur the wrath
<BR>
of society itself (i.e. sort of revenge/discipline) and your own self
<BR>
imposed wrath (i.e. you have contradicted your internal principles and
<BR>
framework of morality).
<BR>
<P>For fun, relate the concepts of 'mana' to 'spirit/sentience/consciousness',
<BR>
and relate 'protocols of access' to 'respect/ethics/laws/legislation/etc,
<BR>
and relate high priests to 'philosopher kings/priests/gods/etc', and relate
<BR>
plato ideas of basic education/morality/etc and training minds in ideas of
<BR>
social good/bad so that if they violate their internal structure of mind,
<BR>
they lose integrity and stability. This sits upon the belief, in some ways,
<BR>
that the mind is little more than an extremely complex organic engine, which
<BR>
over time has developed to hold an internal 'sentience' that is just as
<BR>
easily uploadable into another medium (well, if the medium can support it,
<BR>
it might be easy for a small brained animal, but not a complex brained
<BR>
human!)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, one of the important conclusions is that this process builds up a
<BR>
cosmological belief system used to preserve and promulgate the culture of
<BR>
the society. For instance, wood carving (which is a high status symbol of
<BR>
the skill of the society) can only be carried out by those appropriately
<BR>
trained. People of lesser skill, will do tasks of lesser skill. Also, in the
<BR>
way that many individuals attach their need for meaning to an external
<BR>
belief system, these symbols satisfy the societies members need for meaning
<BR>
and unanswered questions (e.g. the origins of the island, due to the gods).
<BR>
There is a common problem of people using external frameworks and belief
<BR>
systems to retain structure/integrity of mind!
<BR>
<P>Also, as it is a fertility based religion, the father (Papa) and mother
<BR>
(Rangi) gods were responsibile for giving birth to childen (lesser gods)
<BR>
which split the heavens and created the earth. The children are involved in
<BR>
many narrative myths that describe all aspects of the society. It is also
<BR>
believed that individuals are in some way descended from the gods, and
<BR>
therefore must live up to the gods and their ancestors (and, therefore
<BR>
elders) in order to preserve the continuance of society for themselves and
<BR>
their children/bretheren.
<BR>
<P>You could argue that it is an application of a primarily western framework
<BR>
of experience (platoish construction) to this primitive society, but there
<BR>
is much evidence that supports the notion that it is a very cleverly
<BR>
constructed belief system used to maintain and preserve the society. In many
<BR>
ways, there are also very interesting parallels between it, and contemporary
<BR>
society and science. Potentially the question then is, where is the tear in
<BR>
the fabric to break out of contemporary science to see a new world view ?
