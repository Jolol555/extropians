<P>Might as well ask an ape what it's like to sit silently in front of a pad
<BR>
and do calculus for hours. Or make dreamy love to the accompaniment of
<BR>
sublime music.
<BR>
<P>I'd guess the closest we can come to imagining it (which we categorically
<BR>
can't, so why bother?) is what the others have said: an extended sense of
<BR>
somewhat inertialess self--you don't want to be *totally* skiddy--with
<BR>
senses as far and subtle as the probes can reach, partially or optionally
<BR>
merged consciousness with others, enhanced aptitudes as part of the thing,
<BR>
maybe with cognitive and affective partitions that can be switched on and
<BR>
off. 
<BR>
<P>What I'm fairly certain it *won't* be like is Captain Future zooming
<BR>
through the asteroid belt in her souped-up space chariot, having
<BR>
stereotyped visceral thrills galore, or even teleporting to the stars for
<BR>
more of the same.
