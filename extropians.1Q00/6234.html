Dan
<BR>
<P>I am really enjoying this exchange with you.  However it is really starting 
<BR>
to take up way too much of my time.  But if you are interested in debating 
<BR>
this thing to the bitter end, so am I.  If you are interested, I would 
<BR>
invite you to participate in a formal debate of this issue.  By &quot;formal&quot; I 
<BR>
only mean that it would be subject to certain minimal rules.
<BR>
<P>I would suggest that, since I am offering a hypothesis and you are basically 
<BR>
arguing against it, I will post a general statement setting forth the main 
<BR>
points of my proposal.  Your initial rebuttal should consist your response 
<BR>
to my proposal, containing your alternative suggestion (if you have one) and 
<BR>
a list of reasons (rebuttal points) why you think my proposal is for the 
<BR>
birds.
<BR>
<P>Then we could go to town debating back and forth, one rebuttal point at a 
<BR>
time, until we have hashed this thing all the way out.  You seem to be 
<BR>
reasonable and you state your opinions intelligently.  I like to think that 
<BR>
I'm occasionally somewhat reasonable myself.  The two of us just might be 
<BR>
able to reach some consensus on this.
<BR>
<P>But I can't continue doing it the way we have for the past few days.  Me 
<BR>
responding to your 4 or 5 posts, which leads to another 4 or 5 posts, which 
<BR>
leads to another 4 or 5 posts.  Its just too time consuming.  This way we 
<BR>
could also cut down a bit on the traffic to the list.
<BR>
<P>If you're interested in a &quot;formal&quot; debate on these terms let me know.  If 
<BR>
you would like to change any of the proposed ground rules I'm open to that 
<BR>
too.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>-Zero
