<P>
<EM>&gt;Seriously, though, that claim is definitely a misreading of Dennett's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argument, which is eliminitivist, not reductivist.  That is, he thinks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that there ARE no qualia, not that qualia are &quot;really&quot; physical phenomena.
</EM><BR>
As I say....classifcation is irrelevant. If I can no longer use the word
<BR>
&quot;exists&quot; I can use &quot;is&quot;, and qualia &quot;is&quot;, and can never be destroyed by any
<BR>
number of words or logical processing applied to &quot;it&quot;. The very fact that
<BR>
there is an undebated &quot;it&quot; to discuss validates my point. The effect itself
<BR>
demonstrates a dimension to this reality that is understandably peturbing to
<BR>
the &quot;only if I can apply this arbitrary function to it&quot; crowd.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, the reductivist and the eliminitivist arguments are really just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;two different rhetorical approaches to materialism.  If you agree that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;materialism is right and that therefore qualia can't be NON-physical, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only a matter of definition/semantics whether you decide to call some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physical phenomena qualia or whether you decide not to call anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;qualia.
</EM><BR>
Nobody is calling qualia a coherent physical phenomenon - unless they're
<BR>
deeply ostentatious. It is a phenomenon that demands attention in it's own
<BR>
context. Empirical science cannot even attempt to grasp this - but
<BR>
redefining &quot;existence&quot; to purely &quot;empirically&quot; coherent material will not
<BR>
make this effect disappear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Perhaps the stronger point to be made here is that nobody's making a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conceptual error.  The reductivist/eliminitivist/materialist argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually begins by establishing that qualia can't be non-physical.
</EM><BR>
Who cares? It's a distinct effect of this universe. The universe including
<BR>
us and everything that we are. Nothing is exempt, much as it may make
<BR>
sophistry more easy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Certainly, then, the eliminitivist isn't making a mistake: he takes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that qualia are, by definition, non-physical, and therefore, since nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-physical exists, no qualia exist.
</EM><BR>
Again, if I can't use &quot;exist&quot; by definition, then the prescribed definition
<BR>
is a mere subset of those effects/material/whatever things that &quot;are&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But the reductivist isn't making a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mistake either: she can argue that certain physical phenomena have enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;properties in common with qualia that almost all of the sort of things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that we say about qualia are also true of the chosen physical phenomena.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you believe that enough of these properties are shared, you might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convinced to say that the physical properties could inherit the name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;qualia,&quot; since its original definition is empty.
</EM><BR>
&quot;Qualia&quot; is just a pointer. Read extra into it as you wish. If you're
<BR>
unhappy with the definition of &quot;qualia&quot;, then another pointer must be made
<BR>
to the same effect that &quot;is&quot;, if we're ever to understand the function,
<BR>
constituents and implications of such effects. As I said before, I label the
<BR>
effect &quot;formerly known as qualia&quot; as &quot;itdoesexistyoustupidbastards&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It all resolves around the inherent problem that there's no way (even in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;principle) to tell which of the following two claims are correct:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;1)  Almost everything you say about X is wrong, but is true of Y; you must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;REALLY be talking about Y.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2)  You're talking about X alright, but everything you say about it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrong.
</EM><BR>
I agree with this, but I will say to you now that I and everyone else knows
<BR>
DICK about qualia, and the more central &quot;consciousness&quot;, I AM it, so it is
<BR>
here. I'm no dogma-fool or mystic - quite the opposite in fact. From my
<BR>
perception, an attempt to rid your worldview of bizarre effects such as
<BR>
consciousness and the associated qualia constitutes a typical an oft-noted
<BR>
threat to a &quot;know-all&quot; view of eternity. You probably have no idea how
<BR>
ridiculous this seems to me. Basically, all there is is X, we have no other
<BR>
data - so &quot;everything we say about it&quot; is pointless speculation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Example:  &quot;Of course I know what a horse is.  A horse is a rounded edible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fruit, coming usually in either red or green.  Fresh ones make a crunch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;noise when you eat them.&quot;  Am I talking about horses or not?
</EM><BR>
Definitions, definitions, definitions. We can't even hope to define qualia
<BR>
or consciousness until we have enough data to make the word any more than a
<BR>
pointer to the observed effect - and we have none except that perception of
<BR>
the effect. The effect will ALWAYS be here and there's NOTHING you can do
<BR>
about that - except destroy all entities that produce &quot;it&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Reductivism, then, just assumes 1 is right with regards to your claims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about qualia.  You're not REALLY talking about the non-physical, she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argues: you're REALLY talking about these physical phenomena.
</EM><BR>
Nonsense in the context of my argument...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is this blatantly obvious to anyone else?
</EM><BR>
Obviously not on this list. But then, philosophy is just a sideline here. If
<BR>
any of you extropians have knowledge of any decent philosophy lists - and
<BR>
more importantly, you know the difference between philosophy and sophistry,
<BR>
let me know - I'd be eternally grateful.
<BR>
<P>Yours, (honestly - I'm just a bit disillusioned and therefore angry)
<BR>
Rob.
