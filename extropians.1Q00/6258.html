<EM>&gt; &gt; See, now that's just what I mean!  There isn't any of this great,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dramatic indecision and hesitation.  The correct choice is usually an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; order of magnitude better than any alternative, and obviously so; I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recall only one or two major decisions in my life when this was not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case, and neither of them were transhumanism-related.  (And hey, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make the wrong decision, you make the wrong decision.  Obsessing over it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; won't help.)  I read _Great Mambo Chicken_ when I was eleven, and I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not &quot;decide&quot; that my life would be about ultratechnology; I simply knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that it would be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There was never a point, in all my life, where I could have plausibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; refused the quest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You too? I think the same holds true for me - I have as far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember (plus some supporting evidence from my parents from earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; periods) been aimed at space, ultratech and going beyond the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human. Beside some theme music I have never noticed anything like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call to adventure, I guess either we are both suffering from poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scriptwriting, have a modernist script not using the monomyth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure, or our lives so far have only been the beginning of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; story and the call to adventure is in our future.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, from Neo's perspective, it was much the same thing.  Any
<BR>
&quot;ordinary&quot; person might have had a decision to make, but given Neo's
<BR>
biases and attitudes - and especially given as he had spent so much time
<BR>
and effort trying to find Morpheus and discover just what was going on -
<BR>
there really wasn't any choice as to what pill he could take.
<BR>
<P>The call to adventure is constant.  It sounds every time we hear a new
<BR>
idea with promise to dramatically improve your world, where the
<BR>
alternative is not bothering with it.  Many would dismiss these dreams
<BR>
as pure fantasy and/or too risky - but given who we are, we have no
<BR>
choice but to explore.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, we still don't know if the genre we are living in is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science fiction, thriller or socialist realism... :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonfiction.  People don't bother making up stories exactly like it
<BR>
'cause it's just what people experience day to day anyway - and who
<BR>
wants to hear *that*?  ^_-
