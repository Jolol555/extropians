<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;         The first big clue that Bill Joy is way off in his wired
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; article comes with his comment early on:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tiny elite - just as it is today&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;         I don't know how he came up with this but to me nothing could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be further from the truth.
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as I am concerned, he's reached his dotage...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip, snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I would have to disagree. At the current time, corporations and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;large &quot;elite&quot; groups can wield far more computing power than you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;possibly buy. Even if you get all your friends together ala SETI. IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is going to have a petaflop computer in just a few years. All cheaper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;computer chips mean is that the corporations can still buy many more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of them than you. I will admit that the Internet is quite an empowering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;invention for the individual, buts lets face it that big money still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;matters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, the fact of the matter is that the average individual presently has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need whatsoever for control over large systems of machines.  I personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have no idea what to do with a supercomputer, besides writing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading, like I do on my lowly Pentium class box.  However, say, if some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of computational war were to be declared by IBM against the rest of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and if the stakes in the outcome were sufficiently important) the ~200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; million internet users could combine the computing power of their machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and absolutely trounce IBM.
</EM><BR>
<P>You wouldn't need that many. IBM's most complex computer is of the Deep
<BR>
Blue variety, with about 1000 CPUs. They don't have many of these. Most
<BR>
internally operated machines at IBM range from desktop PCs up to large
<BR>
servers that will use typically 24-48 processors, but these are rare and
<BR>
IBM only operates a few of these, most of their servers are 1-4
<BR>
processor RISC systems. They do maintain rather large RAIDs to house all
<BR>
of the data they keep on customers, products, designs, etc.
<BR>
<P>However, such systems are NOT expensive. The general manager at Datamann
<BR>
(my main client) just picked up two raid systems, used, that have 24 and
<BR>
36 4.5gig SCSI ultrawide drives each, for a total of $2500. We can part
<BR>
out those drives at $200-400 and easily double or quadruple the money
<BR>
spent on them, but those systems are available at reasonable rates. The
<BR>
RS/6000 systems we sell new from IBM are actually rather affordable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now only the military and the police are allowed to have special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons like fully automatic weapons.  But if war were to break out between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the police/national guard against the millions of legally armed folks in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US with their hunting rifles and pistols, my money would be on the poorly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armed masses.
</EM><BR>
<P>THis isn't true. Any law abiding citizen can own fully automatic
<BR>
weapons. They simply need to fill out some paperwork and pay a $200.00
<BR>
transfer tax and send it to the ATF. I've got my machine gun (and a
<BR>
silencer). There are currently 200,000 registered privately owned
<BR>
machine guns in the US. Granted this is limited, no new machine guns are
<BR>
allowed to be manufactured for the public, since 1986, but those 200,000
<BR>
are quite legally owned and resold to others. However, your main point
<BR>
is correct. Given a contest between the 1 million armed infantry
<BR>
soldiers the US Govt could field if it called up all National Guard and
<BR>
reserve units, and the 80 million gun owning individuals and/or
<BR>
households, I would bet on the people.
