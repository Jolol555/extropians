<P><EM>&gt;&gt;I have read many of the posts on this thread and I'm mind boggled.  I mean,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;if we are really talking about having some money to do something courageous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;with — what do you want to do? Live or die?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I call it a war on death.  The best defense is a cultural offense.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yeah sure spreading longevity propaganda is a good idea.  But I think you'll 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a hard time getting John &amp; Jane Public to get on board until we can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eliminate (or at least substantially reduce) world poverty and hunger.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean the obvious response is: &quot;What?!?  There are *millions* of starving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people in the world who don't have access to decent medical care, potable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;water or residential and communication infrastructures and you want us to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work on giving them indefinite life spans?  Are you mad?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a different opinion.  Whether or not anyone thinks investing in
<BR>
extreme life extension is an inappropriate allocation of monies makes
<BR>
little difference in the long term.  People once thought that a couple of
<BR>
guys who wanted to fly airplanes were mad.  Those madmen became heros who
<BR>
persisted in their dream.  Today we benefit from it — but flying airplanes
<BR>
was just a mere ambition. 
<BR>
<P>But, let's not divert from the central question originally posed to us
<BR>
which was:  &quot;What bold endeavors do you wish you could see funded in the
<BR>
next decade?&quot;  I'm not so concerned about what anyone thinks when I'm
<BR>
carefully considering one important problem regarding the well being of
<BR>
humankind and what I would do to help humankind overcome it.  As such, the
<BR>
use of the money would be to *increase the well being of humankind.*  What
<BR>
better way to philanthropically bestow well being than to overcome disease
<BR>
and death -- whether it be through uploading, cryonics, AI, genetic
<BR>
engineering, nanotechnology, etc.  (Personally, I do not believe that it
<BR>
will be any one isolated avenue but a combination of many fields.)  
<BR>
<P>In that the pools of money originally referred to was in part from &quot;(1) the
<BR>
estimated fifteen trillion dollars that baby boomers stand to inherit from
<BR>
the World War II generation,&quot; the baby boomers are most definitely
<BR>
interested and involved in basic areas life extension.  Cosmetic surgery,
<BR>
fitness routines and lean figures may seem very mundane, but multi-track
<BR>
and see these boomers a decade up the road and they will be lined up for
<BR>
cryonics, and then a few more decades up the road and they may be lined up
<BR>
to have their brains uploaded.  
<BR>
<P>Also,  the word &quot;endeavors&quot; is plural and there is no reason why you can't
<BR>
feed the world with your $100 million.  I'd take the billions and free
<BR>
everyone from the prison of death.
<BR>
