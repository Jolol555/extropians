<P>
Rights occur in a more general moral context.  Morality is a set of 
<BR>
principles for achieving values.  It is the fact that humans are of real 
<BR>
value to each other that supplies the valuative component that gives the 
<BR>
concept substance.  In a lifeboat situation, where other humans are of 
<BR>
definite disvalue - not enough food, air, space, whatever - rights no longer 
<BR>
apply.  Morality still applies in the lifeboat - it tells you to kill first 
<BR>
and best, because that's in your self-interest.
<BR>
<P>To reiterate, in anything approaching normal society, however, other humans 
<BR>
- collectively at minimum, and hopefully, individually on a case by case 
<BR>
bases - are the most valuable thing in the universe to date.  Most of the 
<BR>
things that make life worthwhile are provided by the fact that there are 
<BR>
billions of other selfish humans out there.
<BR>
<P>The unborn and young children may or may not be of value to anyone else, on 
<BR>
a case by case basis.  There is nothing in objective morality that demands 
<BR>
that anyone, parent or otherwise, sacrifice their self-interest for the 
<BR>
survival of foetuses or anyone else.  It is easily observable, however, that 
<BR>
many more people in present-day society want children and are willing to 
<BR>
spend huge sums to raise them than there are children available.  (Much - 
<BR>
probably most - of this is due to the evil social workers who block 
<BR>
adoptions because they undercut their livelihood in the social services / 
<BR>
foster-care system, as has been thoroughly documented.)
<BR>
<P>No one can morally force someone to raise an unwanted child.  But, as I 
<BR>
mention above, in a normal society, the great value that people are to one 
<BR>
another ensures that very few children are genuinely unwanted.  To claim 
<BR>
that anyone has the &quot;right&quot; to live at someone else's expense, however, 
<BR>
invalidates the very concept of rights itself.
<BR>
<P>In previous postings, I have discussed ideas for actually enhancing the 
<BR>
value of children and other humans to each other.  The concept of investing 
<BR>
in children - or adults - is hardly new.  What is new is the notion that the 
<BR>
newer financial vehicles and information systems make this process extremely 
<BR>
feasible and potentially profitable far beyond buying stock in traditional 
<BR>
investment vehicles such as corporations or trusts.
<BR>
<P>A fluid international (post-national eventually, as this idea has the 
<BR>
possibility of actually obsoleteing the nation-state) system of sureties, 
<BR>
bonds, local monitoring - as with the micro-loans system - and low-cost 
<BR>
arbitration makes it possible to concieve of mass investments in people as 
<BR>
individuals, whether case by case or through mutual fund type arrangements.
<BR>
<P>In a system in which it would be profitable for a 1st worlder to invest 
<BR>
directly in the education of a child in central Africa - the payback coming 
<BR>
in the value of the negotiable shares - the value of individual people would 
<BR>
become much more apparent and explicit.  It would be much harder to ignore a 
<BR>
person's humanity or pretend that they were worthless because of the wrong 
<BR>
skin color or religion, etc.
<BR>
<P>In such a world, it would be rare for a late-term abortion or actual child 
<BR>
abandonment to happen.

<P><EM>&gt;On Fri, 21 Jan 2000, john grigg wrote:&gt; &gt; Isn't a late-term fetus (last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trimester) to be honest a... baby?  Semantics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are used to make something appear not so human and so more easily 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disposed of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Its a semenatic issue.  The collection of information contained in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a late-term fetus (leaving aside the question of information growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;due to the experience of the parents), probably falls into the category
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of semi-easily reproducible.  On the other hand the information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contained in a 2 year old is many many orders of magnitude above this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Instead of pushing the valuation back towards the younger end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spectrum, it is probably much more rational to push it *ahead*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the older end of the spectrum (though this flies in the face
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the emotional ties that soft wet cuddly babies generate).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd suspect that the first year or so of life is primarily involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in neural outgrowth laying the foundation for the huge pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accumulation that is occurs in the 1-3 y.o. stage.  Once you have in place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the foundation for locomotion and speech recognition and production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then the rate of accumulation of difficult-to-reproduce information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goes up substantially (as would rational valuations on the proto-human).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I remember reading about a controversial philosophy professor who has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put forward the idea that children up to a certain time after birth should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be under &quot;probation&quot; as to whether or not they are allowed to live by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parents.  There have been protests at the college that recently hired him 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to try to kick him out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Irrational people know no limits.  Seems like a reasonable and logical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strategy to me.  Though it depends what he uses to judge the &quot;probation&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;period.  Past problems with gene defects (that might provide a rationale 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;due to the &quot;poor investment&quot;) will soon be correctable.  So the question is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how do you decide who has a right to life and who doesn't??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[Oh the thought police are going to get me for that comment...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course ancient cultures like the Spartans and also I believe the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Vikings did this.  But they were warrior societies that wanted only the fit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to survive to produce the best fighters and parents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe the current investment in Western countries for raising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children to adulthood is running around $500K.  For that price those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;babies had better be giving you a *lot* of emotional &quot;stroking&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you can't get that stroking (from a retarded or autistic child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for example), then the only rationalization is compassion.  As the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state of the world shows, compassion is a limited resource and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people should look a little more closely at how they allocate theirs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[Please don't flame me for the above, I have a huge amount of compassion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I tend to allocate mine towards humanity in general rather than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specific instances of humanity.]
</EM><BR>
