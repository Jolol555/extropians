<EM>&gt; &gt; There is no national sales tax, and there is no state sales tax in my

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; outside of meals &amp; rooms, and professional services, so I don't need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anything. Barter is not illegal. The IRS wishes it were, though. If no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; changes hands, then how do they valuate the merchandise? Retail,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wholesale,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distributor, or cost? How do I make out then? I do professional services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exchange for goods, and I will exchange goods that I don't need and don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for goods that I would normally have to buy at retail. Since the value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; property to me is my cost, not the retail value, I gain 30-50% just on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transaction on that basis. Many people will give me a good discount as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their goods for doing a barter transaction, on the order of 10-30%. Almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of my computer equipment has been purchased in this manner.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This gets very complex, and I'm not a tax accountant, so I can't tell you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every detail.  However, it is my understanding that state, local and federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agencies are virtually unanimous in claiming that barter transactions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally equivalent to monetary transactions.  If a particular transaction is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not taxable in the first place it obviously doesn't matter, but if it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxable you're supposed to pay the tax whether you use money or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, since I'm in a state that has no sales tax, and there is no national
<BR>
sales tax, then I'm no breaking any laws. People don't realize that at least
<BR>
half of the power that the IRS has over you is simply due to the fact that
<BR>
people have been trained to BELEIVE that the IRS has power over them, kind of
<BR>
like Freddy Kruger. Granted the Taxpayers Bill of Rights Act was a godsend in
<BR>
mandating that the IRS comply with our presumption of innocence and right
<BR>
against self-incrimination. Refusing to provide the IRS with any evidence
<BR>
against you is the first step to eliminating their power over you. They can no
<BR>
longer come to arbitrary or unsupported evaluations of your worth, your
<BR>
property, or your income anymore, and they are dependent upon you giving them
<BR>
the evidence they need to come to acceptable evaluations. Refusing to
<BR>
incriminate yourself via your 5th amendment rights is your sheild against their
<BR>
opressive confiscation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The IRS has labyrinthine rules covering schemes for paying wages via barter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and how you are supposed to calculate the cash value of the goods or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; services involved.  States with income taxes mostly have similar rules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sales taxes often don't cover small personal transactions in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place, but where they do it usually doesn't matter whether cash changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands or not.  Businesses, of course, are generally expected to collect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sales tax even on barter transactions, and once again there are byzantine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rules about how you are supposed to calculate cash values.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I am a resident of a state that has no sales or income tax, and I have no
<BR>
point of presence in any state that does have such taxes, and states that do
<BR>
have such taxes cannot collect them on interstate sales to states that have no
<BR>
such taxes, I am acting completely within my rights. Using barter helps
<BR>
eliminate the trail of evidence that the IRS can use against me if it decides to
<BR>
target me. Hell they lost my 1997 tax return (though they cashed my check to
<BR>
them), and are now insisting that I file again for that year. I've decided to
<BR>
just ignore them. They have yet to ask me about my 1998 or 1999 taxes. As far as
<BR>
they are concerned, I am a rather poor person who doesn't make enough money for
<BR>
it to be worthwhile for them to go after me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mind you, a lot of these rules are not well enforced, due to the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems involved in collecting evidence.  However, people who rely heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on barter to avoid taxes do tend to get prosecuted, especially if the dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value of the goods involved is large.  In essence, then, using barter may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make tax evasion easier to get away with, but it doesn't mean you aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breaking the law.
</EM><BR>
<P>The people who get prosecuted are those that flaunt their wealth, and are easily
<BR>
assessed. Having a half a million dollar house, a Mercedes and a boat doesn't
<BR>
sqare with a person who doesn't make enough money to have to file for taxes. If
<BR>
you want to fly under the radar, you have to live under the radar. Don't
<BR>
register high value items in your name like cars or boats, don't have large bank
<BR>
loans, etc. Buy used cars, pay cash for real estate, keep your bank accounts
<BR>
offshore, etc.
