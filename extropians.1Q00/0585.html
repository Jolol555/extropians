<P>
As J.R. pointed out, those who are not only talented but ambitious and 
<BR>
successful do deserve the fruits of their labors (a key reason why communism 
<BR>
failed) I do think they should help the less fortunate.  How to best do this 
<BR>
is the question.
<BR>
<P>But in a broader sense Eliezer is so right in my view.  One person does not 
<BR>
&quot;deserve&quot; to have been born with much higher intelligence then another 
<BR>
person.  It simply happened with luck or a good roll of the &quot;genetic dice.&quot;  
<BR>
The same goes for good looks, health (at least with what one starts with) 
<BR>
and parents (who provide love, socialization and key economic resources).
<BR>
<P>But I have often seen people who act as if these characteristics were 
<BR>
something they earned rather then out of random chance received.  They act 
<BR>
like they are better then others (and they are sometimes in terms of brains 
<BR>
and/or looks) but this was given to them by life while many others were not 
<BR>
so randomly blessed by chance.
<BR>
<P>Of course some people so fortunate take advantage of these characteristics 
<BR>
and maximize their potentials while others do not.  Even with brains, looks, 
<BR>
health and a good family background success is not assured.  That is where 
<BR>
personal choice and ambition comes in.
<BR>
<P>I am touched that Eliezer realizes how fortunate he is.  Some people would 
<BR>
just lord over others that they were intellectually very bright while not 
<BR>
taking into account that this blessing was random, not earned and things 
<BR>
could have been different.  This all goes back to the fact that LIFE IS 
<BR>
UNFAIR and at least he acknowledges that.  Eliezer wants a world where 
<BR>
everyone has a fighting chance and a powerful mind would be part of that.
<BR>
<P>With genetic engineering we will have at first for the elite and then 
<BR>
hopefully the common man, a time when all children can be born with the 
<BR>
genetic potentials for sharp minds as well as healthy beautiful bodies.  I 
<BR>
also want a world where everyone gets to be very physically attractive.  I 
<BR>
am especially tired of the elitism there that nature has given us.
<BR>
<P>The janitor slaving away may have been boxed in by his environment (born in 
<BR>
a third world nation to a poor family) or be living the consequences of bad 
<BR>
life decisions such as deciding not to further his education.  Then again he 
<BR>
or she may be developmentally disabled and so they may live in a place of 
<BR>
opportunity but they were still limited.
<BR>
<P>In the end we are each given a different hand of cards from life and it is 
<BR>
up to us to play that hand as well as we can.  I am just beginning to learn 
<BR>
this myself.  I felt frustrated with my hand and basically gave up rather 
<BR>
then go out and do my very best with it.
<BR>
<P>I like the idea of the strong reaching out to help the weak to raise them 
<BR>
up.  In the world that is coming where we have powerful technologies such as 
<BR>
A.I. and nanotech there should be ways never before seen to dry the tears of 
<BR>
the world.  At least to levels we the planet has never witnessed before.  I 
<BR>
am not even speaking of a utopia but simply a much better place then 
<BR>
presently.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>

<EM>&gt;The talented _deserve_ more of the world's good things in proportion as the

<EM>&gt;talented _create_ more of the world's good things. The fact that Weinberg 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;never understood&quot; this, indicates a serious hole in his perception 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ofreality.
</EM><BR>
Nonsense.  There is no &quot;deserve&quot;.  Everyone deserves an IQ of 180 and
<BR>
unlimited wealth.  The only question is what social rules work best for
<BR>
getting as close as possible.
<BR>
I myself have lived my life on the principle that I did not &quot;deserve&quot; my
<BR>
neurohack status, or my intelligence, or my ability to make a
<BR>
difference.  It fell into my lap like manna from heaven.  I don't
<BR>
&quot;deserve&quot; what I have any more than some guy slaving away as a janitor.
<BR>
Nonetheless, considering how much time I've spent working on
<BR>
intelligence enhancement, that I may share the bounty which the random
<BR>
factors have bestowed upon me, I don't think that there's anyone in the
<BR>
world who would tell me to do things differently.
<BR>
The strong exist to serve the weak, and to the abyss with Ayn Rand.- --
