<EM>&gt; I always wonder about stuff like this when I am at Natasha's lovely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gatherings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People who are absolute beasts online (not meaning you Lee) will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be as polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and sweet as pie in person!!!!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sometimes I'll be having an enjoyable, creative and stimulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about creativity or music with some guy at an Extropian party....  then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone,  perhaps Max,  will tell them I am QueeneMUSE and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embarrased, sort of blush, or cringe....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think I have somewhat the same super-silly, contradictory,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loving-yet-confrontive personality face 2face ...expect  display
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *far* less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typos.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there good reason to be arrogant on the net and not in person,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are ashamed of that behavior?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: Do you find that &quot;the real you&quot; is the net-arrogant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person, or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more mild mannered one? And do you find that you are changing your &quot;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person&quot; persona to match the one you project on line? Has it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helped you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hone your true nature?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And finally, do you think that you can say things you cannot say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in preson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (here) because you do not have to face the person, and hence the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If not that, why is it possible to say things here that you cannot say in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Curiously,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; N
</EM><BR>
<P>A few observations:
<BR>
<P>There are studies that have found that people do use electronic media as a
<BR>
means of expressing &quot;other&quot; aspects of their Self. These &quot;other&quot; aspects are
<BR>
often things that they cannot do in the real world, e.g. a real world &quot;weak
<BR>
person&quot; may role play a &quot;strong person&quot; in a MUD. There may be some
<BR>
similarity here to the reason that people write literature.
<BR>
<P>Also, in the &quot;real world&quot; people have emotions and are limited by
<BR>
&quot;conscience&quot;, &quot;shame&quot; and other forms of self imposed moral restrictions
<BR>
(debate on whether they are consciously imposed). In an electronic medium,
<BR>
there is a degree of impersonality that removes this limiter. Note, for
<BR>
instance, in the real world where people exhibit different behaviours
<BR>
whether in small group, large group, individual, private or public
<BR>
situations -- which illustrates that people often have a suite of behaviours
<BR>
corresponding to particular circumstances.
<BR>
<P>Also, sometimes the problems are in the eye of the beholder. When you read
<BR>
email, you may read it  according to your own methods of interpretation, not
<BR>
necessarily corresponding to what the writer meant. Perhaps this is because
<BR>
of a lack of unfamiliarity, and also, the lack of tonality and expression:
<BR>
especially humour, irony, sarcasm, anger, etc. For instance, as part of a
<BR>
shared household, I emailed my cohabitants a number of points regarding an
<BR>
issue we had to deal with. One person interpreted this as me &quot;dictating
<BR>
commands for her to follow&quot;, when really for me, it was &quot;i'm taking the lead
<BR>
and illustrating a number of points we need to deal with as an open gambit,
<BR>
can we use these as a basis to come to consensus ... etc&quot;. Also my father
<BR>
erroneously sent a whole email message in caps lock, and as it was regarding
<BR>
a sensitive issue, I thought he was shouting, I &quot;felt&quot; as if he was
<BR>
shouting, and upon response, he said &quot;no, I didn't mean to have the caps
<BR>
lock on ...&quot; -- what was more interesting was the emotion generated in my
<BR>
own mind.
<BR>
<P>Also, sometimes when writing online, especially when writing about emotional
<BR>
events from the past (e.g. a travel journey, a particular place i have
<BR>
visited), strong emotions are evoked about those places when I read the
<BR>
text. Others may not interpret these strong emotions, because the places and
<BR>
situations do not accord with their own personal experiences.
<BR>
<P>A very interesting area to explore.
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
