</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't quite understand the opposition to mandatory labelling of GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foods, especially as I understand the WTO policies act to limit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labelling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a number of reasons that mandatory labeling has problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) It may be difficult or expensive to confirm that the foods are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entirely GM free.  If your &quot;natural&quot; corn field is next to a GM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corn field and the bees pollinate from the GM field to the &quot;natural&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field, you have to test every seed to make sure it isn't now &quot;GM&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This assumes corn isn't self-pollinating, something I'm unsure of.]
<BR>
&nbsp;(b) We have been brainwashed by the greens to think &quot;natural&quot; is good,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;unnatural&quot; is bad.  This had some merit when we were talking about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavy doses of synthetic pesticides or herbicides.  When we are talking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about &quot;natural&quot; pesticides such as the Bt toxin, you are going to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consuming some of this anyway (unless you have absolutely no insects
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in your food supply), so it really comes down to a question of exposure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level which was the issue with synthetic pesticides as well.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net effect of the greens &quot;dis-ing&quot; the use of pesticides is to make
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits and vegetables more expensive.  This helps to deny access to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the anti-cancer vitamins and minerals in these foods to the poorest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% of the population.  The bottom line on synthetic pesticides was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they probably were &quot;procarcinogenic&quot; for agricultural workers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to higher exposures, but relatively harmless for the average consumer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect putting the insecticides into the plants is a good solution.
<BR>
&nbsp;(c) We have a policy of labeling things for their known possible &quot;positive&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benefits (nutritional labeling) or known &quot;possible harms&quot; (fat labeling).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy for &quot;harmful&quot; substances (e.g. Mercury, Lead, etc.) is to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prohibit entirely their consumption above specific levels.  Now with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GM foods, the scientific consensus is they are most likely relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;neutral&quot; (currently) or when there is more nutritional engineering,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will clearly be beneficial.  However, the whole thrust of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GM food labeling effort is to cast doubt on these foods being safe!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they aren't safe, they should be removed from the market. 
<BR>
<P>The entire &quot;basis&quot; for considering the foods possibly unsafe is the
<BR>
introduction of &quot;foreign&quot; proteins into the foods.  As I mentioned
<BR>
above we probably already consume these proteins.  More importantly
<BR>
any time you consume a different &quot;strain&quot; of a food (e.g. California oranges
<BR>
instead of Florida oranges), you are likely to be consuming different
<BR>
proteins (foods that come from different seed-stock histories have different
<BR>
genes and inherently different biochemical compositions).  If we were
<BR>
doing this in a &quot;rational&quot; fashion (the extropian way), then almost *all*
<BR>
foods, should be labeled with the warning: &quot;Contains proteins that may
<BR>
cause allergic reactions if you have previously been unexposed to these
<BR>
proteins.  Degree of reaction may vary from negligible to lethal depending
<BR>
on your individual immune system.&quot;  In short &quot;buyer beware&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
There is a secondary safety argument involving the possible presence
<BR>
of antibiotics in GM foods, but these are at very low levels compared
<BR>
to the probable consumption of antibiotics by the average individual
<BR>
given their presence in milk or annual prescription levels.  There is
<BR>
an argument for lowering antibiotic consumption from all levels.  In
<BR>
which case we should start with the largest exposure sources first
<BR>
(typically physicians).  This argument will probably go away in subsequent
<BR>
generations of GM foods.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, I really don't like mandatory labelling, but if my understanding of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the WTO policies is correct, it will prohibit labelling of foods beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutritional content, denying consumers the choice of whether to avoid GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foods.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  You have to &quot;trust&quot; that the process of developing and getting the
<BR>
foods approved and to market makes them &quot;safe&quot;, just as you do now.
<BR>
Presumably anyone who develops something toxic and makes it through
<BR>
the approval process without it getting caught is going to be on the hook
<BR>
from a liability standpoint.  Manufacturers have a big incentive to be
<BR>
very conservative when it comes to things like our food supply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Other labels, applying to, for example, shoes, would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prohibited from containing information about exactly how and where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; items were manufactured. This seems to me to limit consumer's ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affect the marketplace, all in the name of 'free trade'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, a &quot;green&quot; manufacturer would still be free to publish
<BR>
information on a web site about where their factories are located,
<BR>
their working conditions, etc.   This would be a freedom of speech
<BR>
issue and I doubt you could regulates it unless it gets cast in the
<BR>
&quot;commercial&quot; speech arena.  [Greg might want to comment on this.]
<BR>
While commercial sales regulations might regulate product labelling
<BR>
I doubt it could suppress access to the information if you really
<BR>
want it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't mind at all if labelling were up to individual manufacturers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then consumers could decide if they wanted to pay extra for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dolphin-safe tuna or the shoes manfactured in countries with stronger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worker's rights. I suspect that, given time, not listing such conditions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would create suspicion and distrust of those manufacturers without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete labelling policies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think companies are currently free to publish that they are using
<BR>
dolphin-safe fishing practices and they are probably required to disclose
<BR>
to investors (which is the public) where their factories are.  So
<BR>
the people who *really* care are able to find out.  What the debate
<BR>
is about is the people &quot;in the center&quot; who have been brainwashed into
<BR>
thinking something is bad without really knowing all of the facts.
<BR>
(For example, do you *really* know whether workers are better off
<BR>
in the shoe factory, or toiling in the rice paddies?)  It would be
<BR>
difficult for me to know unless I went and actually spoke with the
<BR>
workers themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I can  support mandatory labelling of GM foods -- even if they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally safe -- even if I am generally opposed to mandatory anything --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just as a balance against organizations working to prohibit labelling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the situation, why is this un-extropian?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you from the persepctive of *you have a right to know*.
<BR>
I disagree with you from the perspective of having &quot;hear-say&quot; evidence.
<BR>
If you know the companies and Agriculture departments are going to
<BR>
be working very hard to not develop anything harmful to you, then
<BR>
if you want to decide something is harmful, the *rational* thing
<BR>
is to require you to do your homework to make that decision.
<BR>
<P>In this situation, perhaps the best thing would be for foods to carry
<BR>
a &quot;product ID&quot;.  The product ID would allow you to go to a national
<BR>
index, or manufactuers web site where the detailed analysis of the food
<BR>
would be presented, along with &quot;guarantees&quot; of its healthfullness as
<BR>
well as any &quot;counter-claims&quot; by the anti-GM people.  In this case you
<BR>
would be making an informed (rational) choice about the product rather
<BR>
than excuting a knee-jerk purchase based on the last &quot;story&quot; you heard.
<BR>
<P>Why do you care as an extropian?  Simply because foods with higher
<BR>
nutritional levels promote health and longevity and will hopefully
<BR>
diminish death by hunger and starvation, and eventually allow the
<BR>
consumption of disease preventing &quot;vaccines&quot;.  If on the other hand
<BR>
the luddites &quot;expand&quot; the belief that these foods are bad or harmful,
<BR>
the public will become afraid of consuming these foods, the market sizes
<BR>
will be reduced or eliminated and the companies will make less money,
<BR>
slowing the development of the technologies that allow the really well
<BR>
engineered products to be produced.  That in turn will contribute to the
<BR>
deaths of millions due to poor nutrition and disease, who might have
<BR>
otherwise been saved.
<BR>
<P>Irrational support of &quot;natural&quot; products (unless you have a really
<BR>
good reason for it), is the moral equivalent of &quot;tolerating&quot; child
<BR>
abuse or allowing the Serbs to run unchecked through Kosovo in
<BR>
my book.  It isn't a sin of commission but people do end up dead.
