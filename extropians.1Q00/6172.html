<P>
'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I addressed this earlier too.  You know, (1) it doesn't matter who's running 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the system as long as its sufficiently and verifiably transparent
</EM><BR>
<P>This is false.  Transparency is not enough.  You need transparency, the
<BR>
capacity to recognize wrongdoing, and the capacity to do something about
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (2) the web analogy (&quot;tons of data, hardly any data crunching&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>LOTS of data-crunching, you just forget it's going on.  Can you imagine a
<BR>
system like this if it depended on human agents to type in what the
<BR>
cameras were seeing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (3)  government-civilian oversight committees, etc., etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which become decreasingly likely as it gets easier and easier to be a
<BR>
despot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure I might be worried about that if I lived someplace other than the US or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometime other than 2000 a.d.  But the fact of the matter is that if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plan to take over the US and overturn our democratic republic you will have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to (1) control the military and (2) somehow convince the military to (a) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attack their friends and families and (b) do away with the civil liberties 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we as a society have fought and died to preserve for over 200 years, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all for the privilege of being able to call you King.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How would you *possibly* do that?  How could you possibly form the military, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic and strategic alliances necessary to accomplish that ludicrous goal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a transparent society without somebody getting wind of what you're up to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and ruining your party?
</EM><BR>
<P>You start small and work outwards.  Despotism is a tiring, thankless job,
<BR>
but at the end of the day, you've got a personal realm of terror that you
<BR>
can call your own.
<BR>
<P>For the curious, you do it like this:  You seize control of a small area,
<BR>
and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  (Whoops!  Those
<BR>
cameras aren't lie detectors, are they?)  You seize control of some more
<BR>
territory, and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  Repeat.
<BR>
Granted, I left out the hard part, which is actually seizing the
<BR>
territory, but the principle is tried and true.  And unfortunately, your
<BR>
cameras can't detect intentions any better than the modern press.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Despotism doesn't, at any step of the picture, rely on secrecy in any way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whatsoever.  On the contrary, perfect transparency is in the despot's best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;interests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What?!?  Are you kidding??  How long do you think Saddam Hussein would stay 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in power in a transparent society?  I'll tell you, approximately 2 minutes.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an empirical point of which I may not be able to convince you.
<BR>
However, suffice it to say that I'm confident enough that right thinking
<BR>
people will see that you're wrong that I may not want to devote much more
<BR>
time to arguing the point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The despot keeps the populace in constant fear because they never know who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to trust because your neighbor might be one of the despot's secret police 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; henchmen.
</EM><BR>
<P>No need to fear THAT, per se: any action whatsoever which the despotic
<BR>
government finds unacceptable can and will be punished accordingly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why do you think every oppressive, despotic government *always* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *ALWAYS* has a secret police.  Why do you think that establishing the secret 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police is one of the *first* things a totalitarian government does?  Why do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you think they call secret police &quot;secret?&quot;  How would you set up a &quot;secret&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police force in a *transparent* society?
</EM><BR>
<P>Golly.  I have no idea.  What DO they keep a secret?  What good does that
<BR>
do them, exactly?  What would they lose by having an openly well-armed
<BR>
thug police?  Oh, right.  It's the difference b/w totalitarianism, the
<BR>
moral theory, and despotism, the fact of the matter.  Well, the point is
<BR>
subtle.  The fact that the government can no longer plausibly claim that
<BR>
they are acting in the best interests of the citizens isn't much of a loss
<BR>
so long as the ruler remains threatening.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;That way you can be quite confident that when the despot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;claims that he'll squash you like a bug, he *really will* squash you like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a bug.  Knowing that someone is a despot does not help you get rid of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;despot in any way whatsoever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, but knowing who his sympathizers are and who the opposition is, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact that the opposition outnumbers the despot and his henchmen will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give you a hint as to what to do to regain your freedom, don't ya think?
</EM><BR>
<P>As if all you needed were numbers.  You need weapons, too.  And you need
<BR>
to organize.  But if you try to get a weapon, the henchmen will know
<BR>
instantly, and shoot you.  And if you try to organize, before you get the
<BR>
chance, the government will know instantly, and shoot you.  THAT'S how the
<BR>
picture looks when transparency goes both ways but only one side has the
<BR>
physical force and the computing power on its side.
