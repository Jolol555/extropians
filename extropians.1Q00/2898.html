Todd Huffman &lt;<A HREF="mailto:alvinjsminavich@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Predictions%20by%20Kurzweil&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002161718.KAA06188@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">alvinjsminavich@hotmail.com</A>&gt; pointed us to the ZDNet
<BR>
article/interview on Ray Kurzweil.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Ray's predictions are great but I predict he is
<BR>
missing the most important of all things.  I like the way Ray refers
<BR>
to them as &quot;spiritual machines&quot; but after reading his book I think he
<BR>
is missing the most important point.  In his book (and in this
<BR>
article) all he says is that we will know they are &quot;spiritual&quot; with:
<BR>
&quot;They will claim to be people, and to have the full range of emotional
<BR>
and spiritual experiences that people claim to have,&quot; he says. &quot;These
<BR>
will not be idle claims. They will evidence the sort of rich, complex,
<BR>
and subtle behavior one associates with these feelings.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My prediction is that within the next 20 years we will finally
<BR>
discover what &quot;spiritual&quot; stuff or &quot;qualia&quot; (i.e. a red or
<BR>
salty... sensation) are.  This will be the most important scientific
<BR>
discovery of all time and it will finally tell us what we, as
<BR>
&quot;spiritual machines&quot;, are.  Once we do this people will finally
<BR>
realize that trying to know if a machine really &quot;feels&quot; such
<BR>
&quot;spiritual&quot; things simply by observing external behavior as he
<BR>
describes can result in at best an &quot;idle claim&quot;.  When a machine
<BR>
finally says: &quot;Oh *THATS* what salt tastes like&quot; and we objectively
<BR>
know it isn't lying (i.e. just regurgitate this response from some
<BR>
&quot;rich, complex, and subtle&quot; abstract lookup table is a lie since it is
<BR>
not really feeling or knowing what a salty sensation is like.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to do true &quot;effing&quot; will then follow.  Only when
<BR>
we do this can we finally know just how conscious others are and how
<BR>
much like our consciousness their consciousness is.  (&quot;Oh that's what
<BR>
salt tastes like for you, it's different for me...&quot;)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we do this any claim that a machine is &quot;spiritual&quot; is
<BR>
just an &quot;idle claim&quot;.  I know some of you side with Ray and would
<BR>
disagree with this point of view but thank goodness we agree that,
<BR>
some day soon, we will know for sure who is right and who is really
<BR>
just making &quot;idle claims&quot;.  Only when we can do this will we know for
<BR>
sure when there is &quot;no longer any distinction between humans and
<BR>
computers&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the greatist scientific discovery of all time and
<BR>
when will it be made?  I'm predicting we are about to find out and
<BR>
that the many people like Ray will be kicking themselves for a long
<BR>
time for coming so close yet completely missing it.  Please mark my
<BR>
words.
<BR>
