<P>But Eliezer, you don't do it because of that reason (which IMO is a
<BR>
non-reason, and if true, would sooner or later fail to be a self-motivator.
<BR>
Speaking from *personal* experience, as soon as the &quot;weak&quot; start *taking*
<BR>
things from you, they begin to move from the position of people of
<BR>
people who got positions they didn't deserve, to little vermin who should
<BR>
be stomped on.  There is an old saying that was popular in my family --
<BR>
&quot;If you give them an inch, they'll take a mile.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You work as hard as you do on your projects, because (a) it is what
<BR>
you can do; (b) derive personal satisfaction from it; and (c) are
<BR>
scared of what will happen if you don't.  If that isn't enlightened
<BR>
personal self interest, then I don't know what is.
<BR>
<P>Or, perhaps I may be misinterperting your comment.  It isn't clear to
<BR>
me whether you want to throw her in it or dance with her to the edge.
