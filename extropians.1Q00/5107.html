<EM>&gt;'Profiles of the Future.' I bought that book last year at the annual gun

<EM>&gt;show in Alaska and got a huge kick out of it. I am lucky to know a big shot

<EM>&gt;like you! :)

Ho ho. Thanks. However, I see that the dreaded g*n virus has even infected 
<BR>
such innocent messages. If you got a huge kick out of a book bought at a gun 
<BR>
show, maybe try firing a smaller calibre book. As for me, neither a bigshot 
<BR>
nor a small shot - I never touch the stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>You're right!  It just so happened I ran across the book at a gun show which 
<BR>
shows the intellectual bent of our local gun lovers!   And books can have 
<BR>
memetic recoils. lol :)  IF you are not a bigshot or a small shot, then how 
<BR>
about a sure shot?  Now surely Damien, you enjoy firing a gun?  Even if it 
<BR>
has been a long time?  What is going on in Australia??  I thought you folks 
<BR>
were as fierce on gun freedom as Americans but that is not what I am 
<BR>
hearing.  The New Zealanders will invade and steal all your nation's women!! 
<BR>
;)
