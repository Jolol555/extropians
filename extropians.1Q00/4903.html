<P>
I was going back through my mailbox, sorting the list...
<BR>
Nanotech, luddites, guns, nanotech, luddites, guns (sounds
<BR>
like a mantra).  One thing I relized is that relatively
<BR>
innocent comments/questions by people who generally stay
<BR>
out of the flame wars does act to trigger them.  When
<BR>
the question was posed in what was ostensibly a nanotech
<BR>
thread of whether anyone had heard of a high firing rate
<BR>
(non-nanotech) weapon, or the question shifted to how
<BR>
to enforce simulated wars, then the subject lines should
<BR>
have been changed (QUESTION/LEGAL/POLITICS/etc.).  This
<BR>
would allow better message processing at a higher level.
<BR>
<P>So, I would like to recomend that before you engage your
<BR>
fingers to type a response, *and* before you hit the
<BR>
send key, ask yourself, &quot;*Is* that subject line relevant
<BR>
to my comment?&quot;  Conversely, some people seem to exercise
<BR>
their creativity by *changing* the subject line when it
<BR>
really isn't necessary.  You do the list a disservice
<BR>
when you do this because it means people can't sort
<BR>
their mailbox by Subject and read a topic as a collective
<BR>
set of messages.
<BR>
<P>Why am I discussing this?
<BR>
<P>Well, Slashdot has *finally* released the new source code
<BR>
for their server, so we can get back on track for an integrated
<BR>
ExI News/Email server.  This will ultimately only work well
<BR>
if people cooperate and make an effort in helping the
<BR>
&quot;dumb&quot; computer software properly sort messages so they
<BR>
can be organized in the topic hierarchy.
<BR>
<P>So lets start developing those habits that will make our
<BR>
lives easier in the future.
<BR>
