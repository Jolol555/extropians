<EM>&gt; I'm afraid I can't completely share your optimism,  I think we'd better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get really used to hearing the accusation &quot;playing God.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I was on a local television program debating the issues of cloning. Oddly enough
<BR>
most of us there were in the pro camp. I remember one individual that was a PETA
<BR>
person. The commentator, a local news celeb, put her on the spot by asking her
<BR>
would she condemn me (quadriplegic) to continued disability when possibly a new
<BR>
replacement body could be cloned for me. She actually put the abstention of
<BR>
possible suffering of animals above helping a fellow human being!
<BR>
<P>When asked MY opinion of cloning of course I was in favor. I took the
<BR>
opportunity to point out that I was not in favor of the monstrous thought of
<BR>
destroying a sentient being to replace my body but that knee jerk superstition
<BR>
influenced laws would impede or prevent legitimate research in tissue
<BR>
engineering and the like. At what point do you call it a human being if you are
<BR>
engineering everything from organs to limbs perhaps even a torso? If you can
<BR>
produce a clone with only enough brain to control bodily functions and not be
<BR>
conscious, what is the difference between this and a collection of parts?
<BR>
<P>I headed off the issue of &quot;playing god&quot;. I said, (paraphrasing myself as it's
<BR>
been a while) &quot;Some people would accuse me of 'playing god' but I disagree. To
<BR>
play god, I would have to call energy into existence from nothing and form that
<BR>
into matter. I'd have to wait a few billion years for that to become life. I'd
<BR>
have to wait a few more billion years for that life to become human beings.
<BR>
Frankly, I don't have time to 'Play God', I'd rather just use what's already
<BR>
here.&quot; Of course I did not go into the fact I am an atheist or address the fact
<BR>
most xians would disagree with the evolutionary bent of my argument or that one
<BR>
couldn't possibly produce humans again if starting from scratch but I did get a
<BR>
chuckle from the scientists on both sides of the issue. There was no time to go
<BR>
into any details given only enough time for a sound bite. I tried to make it
<BR>
poignant and humorous.
<BR>
<P>Before the cameras even rolled I said to the whole group sitting there looking
<BR>
nervous as hell, &quot;I don't know about you all but I think the real over abiding
<BR>
question we are here to discuss is: If you have sex with you clone--Is it incest
<BR>
or masturbation?&quot; They all busted up laughing and this broke the ice well and
<BR>
served to highlight the fact that most were pro-cloning and scientists and if
<BR>
con mainly so on the side of caution. So it was interesting the following week
<BR>
to listen to the tv-land audiences phoned in objections. Most were xians issuing
<BR>
the usual canned platitudes. One I recall decried the fact (they're opinion
<BR>
only) that there seemed to be a total lack of morality on either side of the
<BR>
aisle.
<BR>
<P>So you see some xians do see our efforts as immoral. Imagine that. Seeking to
<BR>
cure death and suffering is &quot;immoral&quot;! In my own grandfathers words, &quot;God will
<BR>
not be usurped, AIDS is the plague of Revelation and there will never be a
<BR>
cure!&quot;. He would also say it's against god to try to become immortal. I know the
<BR>
bible text he would quote. It has to do with the serpent/Satan telling Eve &quot;she
<BR>
would surely not die&quot; and that with the knowledge of the &quot;tree of knowledge&quot;
<BR>
she/we &quot;would be as gods&quot;.
<BR>
<P>This is the meme which they will use against us. This fundamental meme has been
<BR>
throughout the history of the xian religion the sticking point holding back
<BR>
science and the accumulation of knowledge. They are terrified we will fullfil
<BR>
the prophetic words of old scratch himslef and become gods ourselves thus
<BR>
destroying any need of their beloved god. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the depth of
<BR>
ignorance fanaticism can sink to. They will jealously drag you into oblivion
<BR>
with them if they even briefly think there is a chance you will shed light of
<BR>
truth on their darkness of false faith.
<BR>
<P>In deference to the few rational individuals among them (some among us here) I
<BR>
will say that I refer here to the most acrid fundamentalists. The problem is
<BR>
that even good people get caught up in bad movements. They begin to slowly
<BR>
identify and gradually rationalize from the weakest position their own good
<BR>
reason for full involvement. Throughout history otherwise good people have
<BR>
gotten caught up with the mass hysteria surrounding them and aided in the
<BR>
commitment of terrible acts or unwise legislation.
<BR>
<P>I think we need to head this off at the pass, so to speak. We should invite
<BR>
xians into the fold a little maybe. I'll use cryonics for an example. I see no
<BR>
reason why this must be against any fundamental xian belief. As one friend put
<BR>
it to me &quot;I want to see the future while still in the flesh&quot;. I have said to
<BR>
xian friends and family that if it works the person obviously by their
<BR>
definitions was not yet truly dead. I'm filtering this through a xian paradigm I
<BR>
am familiar with. That of my former own beliefs and of my families current. They
<BR>
don't believe the soul goes to heaven immediately upon death but rather is
<BR>
asleep until resurrection. So, here, there is room to say that should the
<BR>
cryonics patient awaken this has merely been a suspension and no more usurping
<BR>
god then a resuscitation from a heart attack.
<BR>
<P>However, take those that do think the soul goes to heaven. A case could be made
<BR>
that if the cryonics patient is revived, then their soul somehow found the body
<BR>
again. In ether case I don't see how it is necessary to take the position that
<BR>
god has been usurped. I would argue, even though I am atheist, that if god
<BR>
exists we mere humans couldn't possibly usurp him/her/it. That if cryonics works
<BR>
for the individual xian then god has allowed it in order to allow the person to
<BR>
have more time on this world to do their so called good works.
<BR>
<P>What say you all? Could we pander to potential foes to prevent them becoming
<BR>
foes?
<BR>
