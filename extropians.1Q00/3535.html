Perhaps...  but this does not mean that there are
<BR>
qualia.  In what way is the visual part of redness
<BR>
incomputable?  I would think... that if a computer
<BR>
were wired appropriately, the perception would be the
<BR>
same.  Nowhere in the brain does there exist actual
<BR>
redness after the image is turned into a nerve
<BR>
pulse... what you get actually *is* electrical
<BR>
stimulation.  All of your inputs are simply variations
<BR>
on electrical feed from your sense organs.  There is
<BR>
no *redness* in the brain, so it must be... an
<BR>
illusion, so to speak.  A code, perhaps, by which
<BR>
another part of our brain sees these lower levels. 
<BR>
Our map of the world is inside, after all, and is only
<BR>
a translation of the senses.  Perhaps in a coded
<BR>
electrochemical sense the images *are* reproduced in
<BR>
some way for processing... if that is the case, then a
<BR>
computer could perform the same operation, since they
<BR>
are reproduced in the form of this code.
<BR>
There is no where else the information is going, yet
<BR>
you say the qualia would effect it somehow.  In what
<BR>
way?  The only incomputable elements I observe are
<BR>
brownian motion and heisenberg uncertainty, but
<BR>
whether that massively affects the general structure
<BR>
of the human brain is fairly questionable.
<BR>
In any case, your continual arguements of &quot;I see&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;I am aware&quot; seem to prove nothing.  I can tell that
<BR>
you see.  I do not see what you see, but I am not
<BR>
hardwired to your sense inputs.  If I did, I would.  
<BR>
Would that mean I possessed your qualia? *laughs* I'm
<BR>
sorry for even stepping into this arguement... look, I
<BR>
would love, absolutely love to see another revolution
<BR>
in science.  I could *almost* see a reason for
<BR>
evolution to work it's way down to creating bizarre
<BR>
quantum effects.    Almost.  But nonetheless... I
<BR>
think there is a logical fallacy inherent in
<BR>
presupposing their existence, and this is becoming
<BR>
something of a theological arguement.  This is my last
<BR>
qualia post unless I see lab results, and then I'll
<BR>
write something.
<BR>
*wonders offhand whether this is the result of
<BR>
frustration on the parts of the artificial
<BR>
intelligence researchers*

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; the trivial case is simply to say that a &quot;red&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensations is defined to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; represent 700 nm electromagnetic radiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm really not trying to be difficult and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition would be fine for most things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but you're trying to use it as part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foundation for an objective theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of qualia, one good enough for you to know how I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it's just not good enough for that, not nearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good enough.  I won't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bother about &quot;representation&quot;, if you want to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at such a fundamental level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'd need a deep understanding of what &quot;is&quot; is.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;computer  representations have numerical 3D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information but other than that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;are  not in any related way 3D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems good enough to me, In what other way do they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to be related?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Are you saying there is something relevant to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; qualia exist outside of such simple examples
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of spatial meaning and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; definitions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, it's different. I can measure space, I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measure the actions of a robot,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can measure your actions, but I can't even detect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your qualia much less measure it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; There isn't much complexity at all in what red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know and will never know  if red is complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not but I do know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's indescribable. Ever word in the dictionary has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a definition and every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of those definitions are made of words that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the same dictionary,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but no sequence of those words will allow somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to understand red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who has not already had a direct sensation of it.
