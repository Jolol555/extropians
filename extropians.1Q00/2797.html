</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some huge fraction of our health care dollars (20-30%???) goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to support people in the last year of the lives.  I think I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned to some people that this entire area needs to be rethought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in light of things like Cryonics, because at some point its going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be cheaper for the government or insurance companies to pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to freeze someone rather than attempt to keep them alive.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think it can be rethought in terms of much more conventional
<BR>
considerations.   If the same money ( rough estimate: 11% of GNP
<BR>
going to medicine (same in relation to one person) * 75 years of life
<BR>
* 25% of expenses * $30K per capita GNP = about $60K) was spent on
<BR>
young people's better food, living conditions, gym memberships,
<BR>
travel, and education, they would have lived more fun, diverse,
<BR>
longer, and more affluent lives.
<BR>
So in the year of life that is currently their last, they would have
<BR>
better memories of younger life, more savings as the result of
<BR>
healthier life, greater experiences, and better education - and
<BR>
these savings would *much* more than cover these $60K for the last
<BR>
year of life (where a person definitely can't buy as much money as
<BR>
sh/e could buy in younger years)...  except that with the better
<BR>
diet, exercise, and health accumulated during their young years,
<BR>
*this year would not be their last*.  And the next year probably
<BR>
wouldn't either.  And when they actually approach the painful time,
<BR>
they can use the rest of their savings to buy the cryonic suspension.
<BR>
<P>Quiz 1:  is there any moment of any people's lives where
<BR>
this proposal of putting savings in young people's hands instead
<BR>
of old makes them worse off?

[ Answer: yes - people who make money from medical insurance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and machines &quot;protecting the elderly&quot; ]
