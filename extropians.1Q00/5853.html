<EM>&gt;On Saturday, March 25, 2000 8:09 PM Zero Powers <A HREF="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20a%20to-do%20list%20for%20the%20next%20century&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000326203104.9100.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrote:&gt; &gt;1. This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;longevity can both be financed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I realize that.  I was responding to Natasha who emphasized the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; counter the ubiquitous &quot;deathist&quot; meme.  My point was simply that it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much easier to get people to support longevity research once it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the environment will be able to support 10 billion people who like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make babies but don't like to die.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Outside of advanced nations, I'm not sure that many people care about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment.  I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it seems a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;peculiarly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First World concern.  Yeah, sure, you can find well off people in the Third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;World worrying about such things, BUT I bet the average person in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;societies does not care about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know that this is true.  But even if it is, it is precisely the 
<BR>
folks in the developed world who you will need to convince to support 
<BR>
longevity research funding.  Under your hypothesis these are the people who 
<BR>
are most concerned with the sustainability of the environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, this might support Zero here, since First Worlders might not want even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more Third Worlders who are only interested in becoming First Worlders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quickly and leaving the environment as a luxury for the future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But however that might be, the truth is the US generates enough food now to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feed about 5 times its population.  If the relation were strictly linear,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then all we would need to feed a world of 10 billion people is the farmland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of 8 USAs using current methods.  (Remember: most of the US is not farmed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and not all farmland actually produces.  Actual stats are available at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/census97/volume1/us-51/toc97.htm">http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/census97/volume1/us-51/toc97.htm</A>, but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too tired to look them up tonight.:/)  My point being, we don't need a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of research and money to figure out what works.  We don't even that much to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put it into practice.  In fact, probably the simplest way to do so would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to cut off foreign aid packages to all nations, especially Third World 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This would, at the very least, stop funding local elites that typically put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ineffective social and economic policies into play, often for their benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at their peoples' expense -- not to mention it helps to prop up unpopular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and tyrannical regimes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not so sure that this would work.  Although since it has not been tried, 
<BR>
and since everything that *has* been tried has failed, it may well be worth 
<BR>
a try.  I believe the real problem is with food distribution, rather than 
<BR>
food production.  I have not done the research, but the anecdotal stories of 
<BR>
silos full of grain in the midwestern US being hoarded and going rotten, 
<BR>
rather than being efficienly and equitably distributed seem to support this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is hard to convince people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; indefinite life spans won't presently sap our environmental and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agricultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resources when people now typically only live less than 80 years and yet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; good percentage of us are living in poverty and starving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree there will be a problem convincing the average person in the First
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;World, but you don't need to do so.  All one has to do is get longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;research on a firmer footing and screw what the man or woman in the street
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Problem is you will not likely get it done without the approval of the 
<BR>
person in the street.  The bulk of research in this country is funded by the 
<BR>
government.  The people who decide what gets funded are ultimately beholden 
<BR>
to congressional constituents, the people in the street.  I realize that 
<BR>
most research projects are off the radar of the general public, but funding 
<BR>
for immortality research would not stay of the radar for long, thanks to the 
<BR>
like of folks like Bill Joy.  Once you get the person in the street 
<BR>
complaining loud enough that the research is impractical and being funded 
<BR>
instead of things like cancer and AIDS, longevity funding is going to be in 
<BR>
trouble.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Get it done, then enough people will be around to solve these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems.  Notably, corpses don't tend to do a lot of creative/productive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work -- at least, last time I checked.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, once you &quot;get it done&quot; there is no need to research it anymore, is 
<BR>
there?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;- to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I question whether $100 million would have very much impact on longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; research.  My guess is that there is currently at least that much being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spent right now on aging research and other research that will be of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to life extensionists.  And sure $100 million would not end hunger, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could damn sure build a lot of irrigation with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I doubt that much is being spent on longevity research -- not when cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations can hardly fund thier research, not when there exist only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handful of reputable clinics and foundations working on chemical life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extension.  Perhaps some of the big drug companies are investigating this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stuff, but I see most of the real work being done by universities and very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limited in scope.  (Doug!  Prove me wrong!  Please prove me wrong!  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to be right here.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well when you include the myriad areas that will directly or indirectly 
<BR>
impact longevity (immunology, nutrition, genetics, nanotech, aging, etc.) 
<BR>
I'm sure the figure well exceeds $100 million annually.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong.  I wish there was a bunch more research being done 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nano, cryo and immortality.  But the only way to get funding for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; research is to convince people that there money is better spent there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people we already share this planet with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here I disagree with Zero.  I don't the problem exists as he states it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most people do not spend that way.  They don't think, &quot;I've got to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything I have above bare necessity on help the Joneses have as much as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do.&quot;  These Establishment Liberal pieties sound good in campaign speeches 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;church sermons (for some, not for me), but most people never put them into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practice (and it's probably a good thing they don't; what money is sent to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help other societies often does more harm than good and a lot of it gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumed by do nothing bureaucrats*).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that most people (including me) aren't as charitable as they should 
<BR>
be.  However, wanting to improve the standard of living of people today as 
<BR>
opposed to extending the life spans of those in the future is really a 
<BR>
rather selfish (albeit possibly misguided) outlook.  Most people alive today 
<BR>
probably figure that they, personally, will benefit more from environmental 
<BR>
and traditional healthcare spending than they will from research geared 
<BR>
toward extending human life span.  And again it goes back to who wants to 
<BR>
live in a world where the exponential population growth rate would explode 
<BR>
where we do not have the technological, social or moral resources to 
<BR>
adequately care for everyone who is already here?  These are not charitable 
<BR>
concerns.  Nobody wants to live in a Soylent Green world, even if they would 
<BR>
be able to live there forever.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
