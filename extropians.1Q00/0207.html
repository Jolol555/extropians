<EM>&gt;Further, it does not seem to me that the practice of Extropianism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depends on the vagaries of public opinion or sentiment, or on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevailing political climate.  Of course one is free to imagine scenarios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in which this position is tested, but all of them seem unlikely to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>In further support of your comments I'd add that we may change the *practice* of
<BR>
Extropianism to conform to the vagaries of public opinion, if doing so will keep
<BR>
public opinion, sentiment, or the prevailing political climate from landing us
<BR>
in jail (or otherwise penalizing and inhibiting our activities). But no matter
<BR>
how we change the practice, extropy continues to evolve complementarily to
<BR>
entropy.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I will change what I've written in my book, but I can't change the fact that
<BR>
the Earth revolves around the Sun.&quot;
<BR>
--Galileo, explaining himself to the Pope
<BR>
<P>The position of Extropianism (the promotion of extropy) vis a vis politics,
<BR>
speaking just for myself obviously, amounts to persuading politicians to get out
<BR>
of the way, frankly. Certainly the practice of Extropianism (as a philosophy of
<BR>
life) has political repercussions and implications. That does not, nevertheless,
<BR>
argue for members taking any position with respect to social problems such as
<BR>
crime, underemployment and unemployment, and illiteracy, or to political issues
<BR>
such as taxation, public assistance, or business regulation. Popery and politics
<BR>
may seek to ban transhumanism, but that should not convince transhumanists to
<BR>
embrace Popery nor to engage in politics. On the contrary, as you've indicated,
<BR>
when our Transhumanist Movement becomes politicized, or infected with political
<BR>
memes, it loses its extropic quality, and at that point dissociation becomes
<BR>
eminently transhumanist.
<BR>
<P>To identify and classify destructive meme pools as Greg Burch has begun to do:
<BR>
1) Greens, 2) Religious Groups and 3) Hate Groups and Opponents of Liberty
<BR>
need *not* incite politicization. As I see it, these groups represent contagious
<BR>
memes, socio-genic illnesses, and mass hysteria more than factions of any body
<BR>
politic. When you try to explain the theory of heliocentricity, you probably
<BR>
want to avoid groups that consider it blasphemy punishable by death. So, by
<BR>
cataloging potentially troublesome groups, Greg helps the Movement to avoid this
<BR>
kind of pitfall.
