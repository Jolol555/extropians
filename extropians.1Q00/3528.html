<P>
CT, I need to do some more work on the ante/payoff matrix,
<BR>
but in the meantime, suppose you are Charlie, and I am Alpha.
<BR>
You know who I am but all I know of you is you are one of 20
<BR>
lifeforms on a list of players whose characteristics are known to me.
<BR>
<P>The information I am trying to pass to you thru Bravo is this:
<BR>
how many pets do I have.  I wish to tell you without telling Bravo.
<BR>
I know Bravo is a shoe salesman with a degree in French Literature.
<BR>
So I pass the clue:
<BR>
<P>Amara sprinkled a bit of NaSi on her food in order
<BR>
to improve its flavor.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, CT, can you get the number of pets from that clue?
<BR>
Think, then scroll down.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P>I am betting that the French Literature student will recognize
<BR>
only that NaSi is some kind of chemical and will find a periodic
<BR>
chart and guess that I have:
<BR>
<P>Na = element 11.
<BR>
+Si = element 14.
<BR>
=25
<BR>
<P>She will be thinking aquarium, and guess 25 pets.
<BR>
Think some more, then scroll again.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P>I am betting that you, CT, are trained in the sciences,
<BR>
and since you see from the original list of players that
<BR>
I am trained in chemistry,  therefore I could not have
<BR>
made such an absurd error as NaSi.
<BR>
<P>You will realize that of course Amara sprinkled NaCl
<BR>
upon her dinner, and that if one were to subtract the
<BR>
bogus element 14 from the logical element 17, you
<BR>
might be thinking more along the lines of a cat, a dog
<BR>
and an amoeba.
<BR>
<P>If you correctly ascertain that I have 3 pets, you have given
<BR>
me a huge clue as to your identity, for it would take at least
<BR>
a modicum of chemistry sophistication to recognize NaSi as
<BR>
an impossible combination of elements.
<BR>
<P>Have you an example?  spike
