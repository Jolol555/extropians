<P>This is a brilliant idea actually.  With a good campaign some serious money 
<BR>
could be raised.  I think the reaction from fundamentalists would range from 
<BR>
one extreme to another though.  &quot;Huh?&quot; might be the most common one.

<P>Daniel Ust wrote about high-end abortion clinics where cryonics is an option 
<BR>
open for the women.  Perhaps the idea that cryonics is not reversible and so 
<BR>
the child would be frozen for decades just might be an attractive selling 
<BR>
point so that a woman with serious reservations against abortion could take 
<BR>
the cryonics route to take a chance at preserving the life of the fetus.  
<BR>
Cryonics could be a means of assuaging painful emotions but would greatly 
<BR>
add to the costs.  Many people have a hard time affording regular abortion 
<BR>
as it is.  How about Christian run cryonics clinics for unwanted 
<BR>
pregnancies?  Oh boy!
<BR>
<P>Gina did bring up the matter of legalities.  It would seem to be a bumpy 
<BR>
road in that area which might be hard to level out.  I do not understand 
<BR>
fully the legal questions Gina brought up.  Could someone explain?  What 
<BR>
steps could be taken to alter things so cryonics could be an option legally?
<BR>
<P>I realize abortion is a very difficult matter for people on both sides of 
<BR>
the fence.  Many women who have done it did so with heavy hearts feeling 
<BR>
trapped and lacking support from friends, lovers family and society.

<P>Wrong??
