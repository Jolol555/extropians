<EM>&gt; The more I hear about the bizarre restrictions in the Land of the Free,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; happier I am that I'm living in Oz. Can't be certain, but I'm fairly sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you could stroll in a swimsuit or a feathered chickensuit or a giant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plastic pizza from the Yarra River to the middle of Melbourne without
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; molested by police (although they'd surely keep an eye on you, and it
</EM><BR>
might
<BR>
<EM>&gt; help if there were several in the company, so you're not mistaken for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lone escaped lunatic or drug fiend having an unusual reaction). On the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hand, you *might* be assaulted by any number of jeering out-of-work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; young ruffians, the kind who are always picking on Bart Simpson.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I might be wrong about this. It's not something I've ever done, being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too skinny and unsightly. Anyway, it's usually too damned cold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you chanced to be in Sydney during Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras, you'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joshed for *not* wearing gold lame arseless panties, inflatable bra and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wings, and glittery tiara, or full traditional nun's habit and bushy
</EM><BR>
beard,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; while strolling down the centre of the road. Do they do that in Harvard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Square? Even one day a year? If not, don't blame us anal Aussies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, during Gay Pride events, laws are usually laxer on public nudity.
<BR>
At least, that's how it is in NYC.  I'm sure it's the same with other areas
<BR>
and Pride events.  It's too bad such looseness in enforcement doesn't find
<BR>
much application outside the gay community.
<BR>
<P>Though I think the US is not as free as it could be, one must also be
<BR>
careful when generalizing from one region to another.  Where Sasha lives is
<BR>
one of the most taxed and regulated parts of the US.  But naturism is still
<BR>
a big problem in the US, nonetheless.
<BR>
<P>As for me, you have to pay if you want to see.:)
