<EM>&gt; I think the most difficult thing is simultaneous delivery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of all objects, even if you can find the barter sets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, people may want to personally check the value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of each found transaction.  If people refuse 50% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestions after they look at them (you can never perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; describe them in a formal way; people want to look at pictures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-form descriptions, talk to the vendor, etc.) and 10%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of transactions break (not delivered, etc.) then there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very little chance to organize exchanges more complex than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loops of 3 objects.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a difficulty. According to independent analysis, the fraud rates
<BR>
on ebay range from 1% to 6%, depending on what you consider fraud.
<BR>
Traditional mail order is between 2%-5%, according to many of my
<BR>
customers at Datamann, so thats pretty standard, and indicates that the
<BR>
percentage of dishonest people is pretty consistent. From what I've
<BR>
seen, people who engage in swopping as opposed to selling tend to be
<BR>
more interested in the fun of swopping and the social aspects, so I
<BR>
would venture to guess they are less likely to be of the sort to engage
<BR>
in fraud. Using a reputation broker to weed out the scumbags within one
<BR>
or two trades will help, and swoppers could have the suggested swop
<BR>
rings ranked by the reputations of the people in the ring, either as an
<BR>
average, minimax, what have you.
<BR>
<P>Posting to multiple rings on the same item would be ok, because
<BR>
whichever ring fully accepts the trade first will get the trade, so
<BR>
there is a time pressure like an auction, but its a race that encourages
<BR>
as much honesty as possible, because you want to convince as many people
<BR>
as possible to trade.
