John,
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The complexity of these problems is very large and you are
</EM><BR>
unlikely to have single individuals who can &quot;grok&quot; the entire
<BR>
range of possible damages (and solutions).  Solution: Cryonicists
<BR>
should establish a network of individuals, each of which is *the*
<BR>
expert on the state of the art with regard to various pathologies
<BR>
(calcium influx, free radical damage, mitochondrial swelling,
<BR>
neutrophil activation).  Only if you have individuals who are expert in these
<BR>
areas who are able to converse regularly will you begin to see progress in
<BR>
pre &amp;
<BR>
post-suspension methods.
<BR>
<P>I'll emphasize this point by observing that Mike's concerns about
<BR>
arachidonic acid and iron might be dealt with by aspirin and
<BR>
desferoxamine respectively.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Chuckle.
<BR>
<P>I tried deferoxamine almost 20 years ago; it is still a standard part of the
<BR>
cryonics transport protocol. In general, you are right: I've chosen to
<BR>
specialize in ischemia reperfusion injury of the whole body (turns out the
<BR>
brain's a piece of cake out to 20 minutes of arrest time, at least). I' HAVE
<BR>
become an expert on neutophils, platelet activating factor, PMNL adhesion,
<BR>
protease inhibition, and much more. As a result, we get dogs back from 17
<BR>
minutes of total cardiac arrest at normothermia 75% of the time with zero
<BR>
neurological deficit. In fact, these are the smartest dogs in the colony.
<BR>
<P>The barrier now is sepsis-mediated multisystem organ failure which I believe
<BR>
is occuring as a result of necrosis of the tips of the intestinal microvilli
<BR>
(which are marginally oxygented at ~10 torr, even under basal conditions).
<BR>
Unfortunately, the pressors and other druhgs we must give, and the &quot;shock&quot;
<BR>
response from cardiac arrest results in prolonged vasoconstriction of the
<BR>
gut, meaning that it gets not just 20 minutes of ischemia, but more like
<BR>
2-hous   We think we've got this problem licked, and will hopefully be going
<BR>
back into the lab in a few weeks to see if this is so. Then we'll push out to
<BR>
30 minutes.
<BR>
<P>The next model is a really neat one: exsanguinating trauma. This is nice
<BR>
because you have the opportuity to give huge amount of solution IV BEFORE the
<BR>
insult. Needless to say that solution will contain all the drugs that work
<BR>
AFTER the insult, and lots more as well. Preliminary data in acute models
<BR>
indicates that with this sort of &quot;premedication&quot; we can achieve a state of
<BR>
normothermic &quot;suspended animation&quot; of at least an hour. If we cool, probably
<BR>
a lot longer. Considering that the typical trauma victim who bleeds to death
<BR>
before reaching the OR (~20,000/yr in the US)  gets about 10-15 liters of
<BR>
crystalloid, if we cooled that 10 liters to O degrees C on infusion he'd be
<BR>
down (70 kg avaerage man) ~3-5C by the time he arrested. Brain temps would
<BR>
probably be lower because systemic circulation is shunted preferentially to
<BR>
the brain and heart in shock. It's very exciting reserch.
<BR>
<P>Cropreservation rsearch is proceeding in a similar fashion elsewhere. Other
<BR>
experts are working on the problem, with a similarly rapid rate of progress.
<BR>
At some point our inights may be of benefit to them, and vice versa (we both
<BR>
have the blood brain barrier to deal with).
<BR>
<P>The point is, WORK is the answer, not debates about the things that typcally
<BR>
go on amongst those on Cryonet. At least it is the answer if you don't want
<BR>
to wait till the Omega point and you value life NOW and time lost to recovery
<BR>
as TIME LOST. That's up to the individual. Me, I value TIME LOST NOW, and I
<BR>
associate cryopreserved down-time with RISK of the greatest kind.
<BR>
<P>It is a volatile, unstable world we live in (having just retuned from 2 solid
<BR>
months traveling it in the 3rd world) and it is better to be ale to run and
<BR>
think than sit around in a big, heavy stainless steel tank of LN2 pushinh up
<BR>
bubbles.
<BR>
<P>It is also funny how these theoretical debaters about Omega points and the
<BR>
fundamental nature of information loss as it relates to the structure of the
<BR>
universe get REALLY uptight when THEY start to die and are staring the
<BR>
freezer in the face. Then the begging and wishing and hoping REALLY start in
<BR>
earnest. &quot;How soon do you think I will be revived? What about my kids, what
<BR>
about my wife? How much memory do you think might be lost? Funny how the
<BR>
theoretical becomes of such immediate practical concern when all the things
<BR>
you don't consider valuable about life in academic discussions are about to
<BR>
be taken away from you, and just MAYBE for forever. You'll just have to take
<BR>
my word for it on this one: I've seen it all to often. After 30 years' worth
<BR>
of handholding the likes of such Angel Dancing theoreticians I decided to
<BR>
spend my time on prolonging the lives of people who at least know and value
<BR>
what they have, and are willing to pay for more of it, and don't slap you in
<BR>
the face as you try to help them get it.
