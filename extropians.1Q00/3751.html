<EM> &gt; Not in this case. My sense is that the mainstream nano people regard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Drexler et al as bogosity writ large. This is probably unfair, and to some
</EM><BR>
<P>They probably highly resent his publicity stunt. Anything which isn't
<BR>
being paid for by NSF grants/industry and is published in
<BR>
peer-reviewed journals only, plus hasn't a single proof of principle is 
<BR>
bound to be hard to swallow.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; extent ahistorical (but then again, the new academic work seems almost
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; wholly independent of Drexler's). As I probably stated previously,
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, I've been hitting the libraries in mid '80s, reading nano
<BR>
papers. Eric certainly hasn't invented the field, though his
<BR>
particular powerful dream is certainly unique (and, since
<BR>
interdisciplinary, much harder to grasp).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; scientific reviewers of THE SPIKE found it defective precisely because of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the respectful attention I paid to the plausibility of drextech and its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; promoter. They wanted MEMS. This wasn't ignorance (at least one had met
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Eric, attended Foresight, finds him over the top). It's a judgment call.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; And an institutional paradigm thang. If Drexler and his followers ever
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; build a positional assembler, everyone will change lanes fast. Until then,
</EM><BR>
<P>I think viability of machine-phase chemistry is relunctantly being
<BR>
accepted. It's just that people still see certain macromolecules (the
<BR>
neon pump, the fine-motion controller) and immediately judge them
<BR>
impossible to synthesize.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; expect the same reaction mainstream scientists (surely correctly) have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; toward claims of `hydrinos'.
