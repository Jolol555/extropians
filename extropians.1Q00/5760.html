<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;If there were no such thing as criminally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; minded people, there would be no need to have this discussion.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;plain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact though, is that that is not the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But treating everyone by the standard of the lowest common denominator (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;savage) communicates that there is no value, no benefit to behaving as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;citizen. If you expect everyone to act the worste possible way, a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will fulfill your expectations. And it will be YOUR fault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's a bit of a cop-out from free will buff like yourself, don't you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think?  If I assume that you are a crook are you going to become a crook?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if you do is that really *my* fault?  Puh-lease.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure all people are innocent until proven guilty, I just don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; make it a policy to give unknown people the opportunity to prove their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;guilt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However you don't need to know everything about everyone. As work by Robin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Hanson and others with Baysean theory shows, you don't need to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;everything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The only people who insist on knowing everything about everyone are those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have the lowest possible opinion of their fellow man. Such people should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;considered to sick to be allowed to contribute to the development or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;implementation of public policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again you get me wrong.  I recognize that I don't have the capacity to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything.  Moreover I have no desire to know everything.  Right now I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could exercize my rights under the FOIA to search through mountains of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government documents.  I have no desire to, so I don't.  My point is not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give Zero Powers omniscience.  It is to do away with the hoarding of data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Information wants to be free (yes even your bank records) and I merely want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information to reach its goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Under your MAS, you will have access to everything, about everyone, 
<BR>
on every occasion, in every place. Whether you utilize the tools in
<BR>
place 
<BR>
at all times is irrelevant. That you placed them there indicates you
<BR>
have
<BR>
no faith in your fellow man.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You give untold numbers of people the ability and opportunity to prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;innocence every day, and they do so in many ways, all the time. That you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to focus on the rare incident and/or minor risk of guilty behavior, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ignoring the overwhelming weight of innocent behavior as evidence to attest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the 'reasonableness' of your proposals indicates that you have some issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like you I want to treat everyone the same.  You want everyone, criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and innocent alike, to be able to hide their data and themselves.  I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone, criminals and innocent alike to step out of the shadows.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focusing on crime.  I'm focusing on efficiency.  Yes, I do have issues.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; main issue in this discussion is that the hoarding of data is inefficient,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counter productive and sooner or later will be downright dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Efficiency doesn't mean a hill of cowturds when it comes to human
<BR>
rights. 
<BR>
Those that put efficiency before human rights are nothing but
<BR>
borganists. 
<BR>
I treat everyone the same UNTIL they have shown that they are not
<BR>
deserving. 
<BR>
You automatically assume that everyone is worth less than fly spit in a
<BR>
pig sty, 
<BR>
and they have to prove to you that they are clean before you will deign
<BR>
to 
<BR>
breathe the same air as they.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I didn't say that she would dissapear without telling you why, but even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;allowed that if she had a damn good reason, then it would be ok.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course it would, based upon the data about her I had access to before she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left.  Why is it so hard for you to grasp that point?
</EM><BR>
<P>I grasp it fine. It was your misconstruing that exposed the fact you 
<BR>
already have a lack of trust for her.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If she told you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;she was going to Jupiter on a NASA mission, with 20 men, for ten years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would you do then?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ridiculous hypothetical.  My wife would not do that for all the tea in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; China, so I can't give any response.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hold on a sec. You already proposed the hypothetical that she would run 
<BR>
off for ten years without telling you, so it only follows that you don't 
<BR>
trust her to tell you where she is going.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Moreover, once you developed a level of trust in her, from her past record,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;acknowledge that it would be ok for her to NOT be under your surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ten years, so you have just given up your insistence of total surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't spy on your wife at work, do you? Do you feel you have to? Why? Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have a mental problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once again, simply because the means of ubiquitous surveillance exists does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not mean that I would necessarily make use of them at all.  And even if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did it certainly would not occupy the bulk of my day.  Just knowing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universal surveillance was possible would have the desired effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, no as far as I am aware I have no mental problems.  But your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frustration at the difficulty you are having with this argument is once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again leading you down the path of hyperbole and name-calling.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply can't cut that out, I will have to once again drop another debate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with you.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the hat fits...like any fascist or mental patient, you have to 
<BR>
acknowledge you are sick before you can start getting better...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, you trust me to the extent that you've been able to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;surveillance&quot; on me.  Without the information gained regarding my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and my respectable background, you'd have no basis for trusting me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you.  You have made my point better than I could have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No I haven't, because I do not base my judgement on 30 years of utter and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surveillance of your every waking movement, action, and utterance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are now talking about a matter of *degree*.  No you haven't surveilled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me for 30 years, and your surveillance has not been very thorough or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detailed.  But still to the extent that you trust me (which admittedly is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not very much) it is based upon what you *know* about me.  That, Michael, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called intelligence, data gathering, knowledge, in a word...surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Get it??
</EM><BR>
<P>I get it perfectly, however you seem to feel the overwhelming need to 
<BR>
know every instance I ever scratched my scrotum, every time I picked my 
<BR>
nose, felt up my lady love, or spanked my kids for misbehaving. In past
<BR>
days, 
<BR>
it was people such as you who got put in jail for the perversion that
<BR>
peeping is.
<BR>
<P>That I know this much about you totally negates any possible trust I
<BR>
might have 
<BR>
previously had for you. I understand that it is natural for those who
<BR>
are 
<BR>
untrustworthy to have a similar level of distrust for others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;given your history on this list of tending to prefer solutions proposed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;espoused by paranoid , megalomaniacal fascists, my level of trust in you is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and would need to be augmented by countering evidence that you are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;playing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;devils advocate, etc...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More name calling.  Come on, do a little better than that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Treating all as if they are each the worst possible person is not the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;build trust.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One more time, with feeling.  MAS does not treat people as if they were good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or bad.  MAS merely assures that people's actions, whether good or bad, will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be recorded.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Ever heard of the Honor Code? You assume that people will behave
<BR>
according 
<BR>
to the highest, not the lowest, standard. MAS assumes that many or all 
<BR>
people will live according to the lowest possible standard unless they 
<BR>
are treated like common prisoners.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Virtually every conversation that the U.S. President has is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded.  Why do you think that is? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Because politicians, by definition, cannot be trusted to deal with
<BR>
domestic
<BR>
politics honestly (and many ohters you cannot trust at all). Anyone who
<BR>
really 
<BR>
wants the job is unqualified morally to occupy the position.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it because we as a nation have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided that our Presidents are all to be treated as if they are the worst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible person? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, DUH, because they have proven repeatedly, especially most recently
<BR>
as 
<BR>
well as Nixon, that if given the opportunity, they would prefer to do
<BR>
their 
<BR>
dirty work and cover things up and destroy evidence. Dishonorable
<BR>
behavior 
<BR>
dishonors the office, and dishonors anyone who would seek to occupy such
<BR>
a stained post.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or is it because the actions of our President can have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drastic and far-reaching effects and, as a result, it is important to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an accurate record?
</EM><BR>
<P>The best and most drastic things our Presidents have done in our history 
<BR>
nobody who is not Ultra cleared has any idea ever happened. There may be 
<BR>
a record, but there are less than a few dozen people who know it exists. 
<BR>
These are incidents of national security, which do not benefit the 
<BR>
President personally in any way, the existence of the incidents is kept 
<BR>
at highest secrecy, and nobody is worse for wear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stop, think, take a deep breath.  Now reply.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, no.  MAS has nothing to do with the presumption of innocence.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; presume everyone is innocent until proven otherwise.  MAS merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; *verification* of innocence, or the lack thereof.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Why do you need verification of innocence unless you don't trust anyone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;innocent? MAS has EVERYTHING to do with the presumption of innocence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've said it as many times as I can say it in as many different ways as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can.  If you don't get it by now I have to give up.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you have shown absofreaking lootly NO evidence to support your
<BR>
assertions. 
<BR>
I have 70+ years of tyrannical fascism, well documented (those fascists
<BR>
love 
<BR>
their paperwork and their secret police and informant networks) to prove
<BR>
my point.
<BR>
That you choose to disregard Santayana's Law is indicative of your
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;To the common, public, well of information. Haven't you understood the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Tragedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of the Commons?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And how, exactly, does that have anything at all to do with the discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at hand?
</EM><BR>
<P>When your private information is no longer private, it belongs to the 
<BR>
community. Community property is always abused and treated poorly by the
<BR>
state.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't care what the government does, so long as it stays out of my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;treats everyone like I want it to treat me, then there is no need for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Orwellian anarchy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More big and improbable &quot;ifs.&quot;  The government does not treat you the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you want to be treated.  Virtually every aspect of your life is documented.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everytime you get a driver's license, everytime you purchase a firearm,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every time you file a tax return, every time you buy anything other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with cash or a cashier's check, every time you register a vehicle, every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time you apply for a loan or credit of any kind, and on and on and on...it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is *documented.*
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't spoken to or communicated with a government person outside of
<BR>
the 
<BR>
neighborhood cop, the town clerk, and my county sherriff in over three
<BR>
years 
<BR>
(I take that back, I did give a ration of raw sewage to an ATF agent in
<BR>
a 
<BR>
parking lot one day, I asked them if they had notified the county
<BR>
sherriff 
<BR>
that they would be in his jurisdiction that day, when she said no, I
<BR>
told 
<BR>
her to get her welfare ass back on federal property until she notifies
<BR>
the 
<BR>
local CLEO that she is entering their jurisdiction. Federal agents are 
<BR>
breaking the law when they don't notify and get permission to enter
<BR>
state 
<BR>
jurisdiction from the CLEO (the county Sherriff)).
<BR>
<P>I haven't needed to renew my license in three years. I do buy everything 
<BR>
with cash, I don't apply for loans or credit (those are for wage
<BR>
slaves), 
<BR>
and all of my banking is either anonymously or done overseas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MAS will not change the fact that your life is documented.  What it will do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though is allow you to know exactly to what extent your life is and has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documented (which you do not know now) and what is contained in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you know my bank records, then you know my account information. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;my biometrics and my PGP keys, then you can impersonate me and steal my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;assets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With total mutual surveillance comes the end of not only privacy, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;property,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;free speech, free association, and self defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not quite.  See, one more time, the key to MAS is *mutuality*.  Whenever I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access your bank records, you will know it.  You will know exactly what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found out, when I found it out, and what I did with it.  I could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonate you because whatever I did to impersonate you would *also* be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded.  You could then follow my trail and watch as I put on my Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lorrey mask, and counterfeited my Michael Lorrey fingerprints.  In a truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open society there would be no way for me to get away with usurping your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personality, therefore there would be no incentive for me to try, therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you would have no cause to be so scared about me perusing your dossier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anything digital can be counterfeited. No system is foolproof. When
<BR>
privacy 
<BR>
is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With MAS, because everyone will know everything you say, you won't dare say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anything that the majority will dissaprove of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's hogwash.  Are you saying that you don't express yourself now unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you have to say is politically correct or you are incognito?  Seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me you've got more intestinal fortitude than that.  My opinions regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency are not approved by the majority, but I have absolutely no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualms about expressing them (or couldn't you tell?)
</EM><BR>
<P>*I* don't care enough about the PC attitudes of city slickers to let it 
<BR>
interfere with my stating what's on my mind, but I'm an odd duck who has 
<BR>
been through the shit, and now every day I live is merely gravy. I also 
<BR>
know that when and if anyone shows up at my door to confiscate my
<BR>
rights, 
<BR>
they'll get an attitude adjustment between the eyes, so I'm not too 
<BR>
concerned about any consequences of my exercising my freedom of speech.
<BR>
<P>You may not have any qualms about expressing yourself, but thats only 
<BR>
because you are anonymous. I live on the web as I live in real life: I 
<BR>
use my real name, and its easy to find out where I am. If you are all so 
<BR>
fired up about your transparent society, why don't you come out from 
<BR>
behind your anonymous pseudonym and get a taste of your own medicine?
<BR>
<P>Start walking the walk, stop talking the talk.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With MAS, none of your property belongs to you anymore, because everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where it is, and when you are not there to watch it, and what your security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;keys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dealt with this above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;WIth MAS, everyone will know with whome you associate, so you will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;associate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with anyone that is not approved of by the majority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only if you are a *real* coward would you let society dictate who you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associate with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With MAS, everyone will know where you are at any given time. A person with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wish to kill does not care about the consequences of that action, if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where to find you while they are still enraged, they will find you and kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That applies now.  There's nothing you can do about that.  Chances are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though that anyone who wishes to kill you can already figure out where to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find you.  Its not often that a stranger who has never met you has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uncontrollable desire to find you and kill you.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I never met Hitler, but if he were alive today I would not hesitate 
<BR>
to hunt him down and blow his ass away. So far as I can tell, there are
<BR>
at 
<BR>
least ten million other people in the world who would agree with me,
<BR>
maybe 
<BR>
more. Am I justified? If someone raped my sister, and I knew where he
<BR>
would 
<BR>
be at any given moment, would I care about any possible consequences? 
<BR>
No, I would not. There are plenty of sick people out there who would not 
<BR>
care about your surveillance system, and there are plenty of sane people 
<BR>
like myself who would also not let your system stop us when your
<BR>
'perfect' 
<BR>
justice system let the bastards off, and your surveillance system would 
<BR>
still not cover every square inch of the world. Once you've got your 
<BR>
cameras in the cities, they would find other shadows to hide in. 
<BR>
<P>Frankly, these city slicker attitudes make me sick. I see this crap up 
<BR>
here all the time from morons who move up from the city to escape the 
<BR>
problems of city life, then they start screaming 
<BR>
to change things up here so that everything is just like it was where 
<BR>
they came from, then they wonder why everything starts turning to shit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only difference that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MAS will make in this situation is the assurance that the would-be murderer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not get away with his crime.  Will that discourage *everyone*?  No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Will it discourage the great majority of sane people with homicidal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tendencies?  Unquestionably.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly. Any survey of criminals shows they are not concerned with
<BR>
getting 
<BR>
caught, they are only concerned with getting shot in the process.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If the majority decides that you are a politically dangerous individual,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will be found, and dissention will end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are assuming that surveillance equals totalitarianism.  MAS in a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society does not make it any more likely than now that dissent will end just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because you can be found.
</EM><BR>
<P>Surrendering your freedom to everyone else, or just to one tyrant is 
<BR>
immaterial. Freedoms originate in the individual, and when they are 
<BR>
confiscated from the individual, it does not matter who does the
<BR>
confiscating, 
<BR>
or how many people share in the benefits of the confiscation. Only the 
<BR>
specific individual who has demonstrated their inability to abide and 
<BR>
respect the rights of others deserves to have their rights confiscated 
<BR>
in this manner, either by the social body, or by the leaders on high.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So now what?  I can say &quot;Hey Michael I see you just paid another $200 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ATF for another machine gun.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And you can say, &quot;Yes, I know that you know that.  And you also know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; know you just paid $200 for another bullet-proof vest, but that wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; you much good if I decided to use my armor-piercing bullets on you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And then I could say, &quot;Perhaps, but since I follow you around with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ubiquitous public surveillance camera network, I would know the minute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; left your house with your machine gun and I could follow you as you got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; closer and closer to my house.  As soon as you got within 100 feet of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; front door, I'd alert the AI police chief who would be ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;incapacitate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; you with the nano-police the second you pointed your gun at me and put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; finger on the trigger.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And then you could say &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right.  So I won't kill you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; today.  Hey wanna go check out a football game?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Which merely illustrates the depth to which your paranoia has developed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're about 3 straws away from the last one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;machine gun technology has been around since the 19th century, and it has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the least commonly used gun technology in crime, while there are over 200k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;private owners. This record indicates that, by definition, a person who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;owns a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;machine gun is not very likely to commit a crime with it, and is therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;trustworthy. All your surveillance of me does is feed your paranoias to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;point that you and every other paranoiac start screaming to the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;everyone needs to be locked up in chains to make the world safe for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;paranoiacs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 straws to go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Without at least some knowlege, what could there possibly be to base
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;respect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; upon?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That is your primary problem. You don't, in your heart, assume that anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;good or innocent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well maybe you are different (and apparently you are) but with me trust and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect have to be *earned*.  That doesn't mean that I assume every stranger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is untrustworthy or unworthy of respect.  It just means they are a blank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slate.  In my mind you are neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy until you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrate yourself as such.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you insist that you have access to every action they have ever taken,
<BR>
and 
<BR>
every thing that other people have ever said about them, then you don't 
<BR>
trust anyone for anything.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Your insistence that people prove their innocence indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you don't beleive in the presumption of innocence. I do beleive in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;innate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;goodness, innocence, and trustworthyness of the vast majority of people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not insisting that anyone prove anything.  I merely maintain that we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all be better off when we stop hoarding data.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maintain it all you want. I say you are wrong. Show evidence that the
<BR>
abrogation 
<BR>
of human rights is more important than the risk. The fact that we lived
<BR>
through 
<BR>
the atomic age without total MAD on every and any nuclear power (The US,
<BR>
for 
<BR>
instance, did not distrust the British, and we did not aim missiles at
<BR>
them, 
<BR>
nor did we or do we aim at Isreal, South Africa, France, India, or
<BR>
Pakistan. 
<BR>
Only those powers that proved their dishonor through their actions were 
<BR>
treated to the MAD treatment), indicates that human beings are
<BR>
tolerable, and 
<BR>
generally trustworthy. Your MAS system would have you treating even your
<BR>
closest 
<BR>
freinds, allies, partners, and loved ones as if they were the worst
<BR>
creatures 
<BR>
ever produced in history. It does not matter if you actually use those
<BR>
cameras 
<BR>
24 hours a day. It is enough that they are there that indicate that you
<BR>
do not 
<BR>
trust your closest, dearest fellow man.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not prejudge everyone based upon the poor behavior of less than 1% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;population, and I know that if anyone ever does prove me wrong in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;particular instance, I am prepared to deal with that individual, in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;instance, as they should be dealt with, while I can go on treating everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as normal, honest, honorable human beings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great.  Me too.  That has nothing to do with transparency.
</EM><BR>
<P>It has everything to do with transparency. Insisting on total
<BR>
transparency 
<BR>
for everyone is to automatically assume that everyone has something to
<BR>
hide 
<BR>
that is so heinous that they do not deserve to have their human rights
<BR>
respected.
<BR>
<P>I for one do not think so poorly of my fellow man. You might, but that
<BR>
is 
<BR>
YOUR problem, don't make it mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Your problem is paranoia coupled with extreme extroversion, my problem is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;introversion. Since when does your problem become more important than mine?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 straw left.  I am neither paranoid nor extroverted.  But to you point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (such as it is), MAS will not interfere one iota with your introversion.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you want to stay huddled in your house surrounded by nothing but your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arsenal, MAS will not force you to do otherwise.  Just because I can find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out where you live does not mean I'll be able to drop by without your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permission.
</EM><BR>
<P>Say what? You just contradicted the whole idea of MAS. With MAS you will 
<BR>
know exactly when and where I will be. As humans are typically creatures 
<BR>
of habit, you will also develop good approximations of when and where I 
<BR>
will be before I am there. With access to all information about me, 
<BR>
including my private keys, you can ambush me, steal my assets when they 
<BR>
are not under my direct control. Anyone who thinks that MAS is the
<BR>
panacea 
<BR>
for all that ailes society is living in the same sort of fantasy land
<BR>
that 
<BR>
the pre-stalin western socialists lived in. Workers Paradise my ass.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I really hate slick people. I prefer people who are charming as a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;course, not because they have to be...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You only like people who are charming 24 hours a day?  Where (other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself of course) have you ever met such a person?
</EM><BR>
<P>There are lots of such people. My number one rule in life with regards
<BR>
to 
<BR>
dealing with other people is I refuse to suffer assholes gladly. Even
<BR>
then I may
<BR>
cut them slack if its not a matter intentional assholishness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Oh, Brave New World.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Slavery is Freedom......all hail Slavery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah well whatever.  Hey look at that!  You *still* have 1 straw left! Let's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see how long it lasts.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only reason I have one straw left is that you have no actual power
<BR>
to 
<BR>
oppress me at this point in time, so you dare not have your bluff
<BR>
called.
