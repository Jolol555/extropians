<P><EM>&gt; Slashdot had a pointer to the FBI site where they have the

<EM>&gt; was a huge financial drain to keep filling the Freedom of

<EM>&gt; Now the interesting thing is Einstein's file:

<EM>&gt; A quick perusal indicates that an organization I'm unfamiliar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with (The Woman Patriot Organization) tried to prevent Einstein
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from being admitted to the U.S. on the basis that he supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchy.  Apparently, the total file is 1427 pages!!!

<EM>&gt; An interesting site for you government &amp; freedom buffs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Might get you talking about something *other* than your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your current focus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Makes me wonder if I have a file, or if requesting it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if its empty) would make them start one.

<P>You could request one, then later request another.  Maybe some other
<BR>
entity tracks this or that, you would have to ask them.  What would they
<BR>
tell you?  There would certainly be some record.
<BR>
<P>How does one go about requesting the FOIA right of access of all
<BR>
government entities at once?  That is, how does a citizen get the total
<BR>
set of information stored by the government for that individual?  How
<BR>
about this, then, which government agencies or entities store
<BR>
information on citizens?  Heh heh, which do not?  Of those that do,
<BR>
which carry the Taxpayer Identification Number (aka Social Security)
<BR>
which every citizen over five is required to be issued?
<BR>
<P>If the citizen does not have ready access to their data stored by the
<BR>
government (of, by, and for the people) of all of its entities then the
<BR>
government should have the same access as the individual.  That would
<BR>
mean hashing out all references to SSN.  Where is the government form
<BR>
and web page to request FOIA information from every agency at once?
<BR>
<P>I click on some links at the FOIA page (interesting reference),
<BR>
sometimes it is necessary to click the links more than once.  The
<BR>
documents are scans of pages converted to PDF files.  What tools does
<BR>
the government provide to read these documents?  How about their web
<BR>
pages? (Government web pages are largely good and profligate.)
<BR>
<P>About vouchers the ability to encourage teachers, 1/25 of the military
<BR>
budget would be an incredible boon to education, if applied to teaching
<BR>
and students and not so much to administration.  That would be about 1%
<BR>
of a tax dollar.  With the push towards computers in the classroom,
<BR>
remember that the cost of one computer is more than that of other
<BR>
things.  If research and educational development are the keys to
<BR>
economic growth (which they are), then any funds applied towards
<BR>
enabling the youth above &quot;subsistence&quot; education lead to economic
<BR>
growth.
<BR>
<P>If students are to learn about religion, they should learn about all the
<BR>
religions of humanity.
<BR>
<P>Well, government is not all.  Parts of it are good, other parts are bad.
<BR>
<P>Obligatory sci-tech note:  on parser construction.  Today we have reader
<BR>
software to display documents, in the future we will have reader
<BR>
programs that read and organize whatever data and apply expert system
<BR>
templates that people can share to information to extract matter of
<BR>
interest.
