<EM>&gt; &gt; Just an FYI, that's not how the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter allegedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; James, I believe is correct in a classical sense.  This is covered in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some depth in &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;.  If I recall, they basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concluded that the energy costs were too huge to allow transporters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to ever work in a &quot;classical&quot; sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are other reasons why transporters would be unwieldy, but this is a
<BR>
significant one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, in my reading of the text, it seemed to make no sense to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and transport atoms around at approx. the speed of light.  Instead you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want the *information* transported, which given the redundancy in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human body is probably not alot given a reasonable compression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategy.  (E.g. you only need one copy of your genome and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference information in the cells containing mutations [if you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to &quot;repair&quot; the mutations]).
</EM><BR>
<P>I rather doubt you're right about that.  Certainly, at the very least, the
<BR>
layout of the connections b/w the neurons in your brain would need to be
<BR>
recorded if we were trying to build something that remembered your name.  
<BR>
<P>And anyway, ST's transporter works on *anything*, be it biological,
<BR>
inorganic, weird plasma being, whatever.  Only a very tiny set of the
<BR>
things we'd want to move with a transporter have DNA, so your strategy
<BR>
isn't very general.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would note that there is some confusion in S.T. about how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transporters actually work.  In S.T.N.G. there is an incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where Riker gets replicated into 2 copies of himself.  If atom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transport were in fact the methodology, either you would get 2 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dwarf Rikers, or a very big energy bill to create the atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a second Riker from raw energy.  That would be unlikely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have gone &quot;unnoticed&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>This doesn't suggest any confusion to me.  In the mode of charity, one
<BR>
could simply assume that the fact that there were two Rikers standing on
<BR>
the transporter pad was much more remarkable to the crew than the fact
<BR>
that the magic ST battery had been drained twice as much as one would have
<BR>
expected; we could therefore plausibly imagine that no one bothered to
<BR>
call attention to this little detail.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Hey!  Two Rikers!&quot;  &quot;Yeah!  And a lot of energy was used up just now!&quot;
<BR>
<P>No, the ST transporter was very, very simple indeed.  :)
