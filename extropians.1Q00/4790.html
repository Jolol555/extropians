<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;geeez us key riest, man... are you trying to systematically destroy any
<BR>
chance of rational discussion? &quot;the cruel and cynical actions of the nra&quot;
<BR>
implies a couple of very raw assertions, for which you offer no support.
<BR>
that does not help your case. your above rant, while perhaps interesting
<BR>
for its incitive qualities, is funny in the same way that watching an old
<BR>
lady with a walker get run over by a train might be. joe... i love ya
<BR>
man... but YOUR NOT HELPING! if you resume your former high-volume
<BR>
behavior, and your post quality is on the order of the above, i will have
<BR>
no choice but to ploink ya.
