<P>
<EM>&gt; Here's a discussion of a trick question you're likely to encounter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ==
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If anyone raises the question of immortal souls, &quot;Why call them back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from heaven?&quot; and all that, don't attack religion as a response.  People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't going to suddenly stop believing because you tell them to.  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most, you might dare to sound unsure about the existence of souls; most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will accept that you might have doubts because they have doubts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves, but they won't accept an atheist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  Answering a religious question by attacking religion is just a
<BR>
short-hand way of telling them &quot;I'm your enemy&quot;, &quot;I'm probably Satanic&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;I'm not even seriously going to consider your question&quot;, and &quot;Now I'm going
<BR>
to ridicule you, your question, and your belief system.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I like to answer religion questions on their own terms.  I also like to give
<BR>
hypothetical answers starting with &quot;If...&quot; so I don't define what I do or
<BR>
don't believe.
<BR>
<P>If a soul were cryonically frozen, it would not get trapped any more than
<BR>
souls could get trapped in a frozen lake or in a mud slide.  If a soul is
<BR>
immaterial and not constrained by natural laws, low temperatures applied to
<BR>
the physical body shouldn't affect the soul.  So I'm not really worried that
<BR>
cold temperatures and ice can somehow block a soul's ascent to heaven.
<BR>
<P>If cryonics were against God's will, He simply would not send the soul back
<BR>
to reanimate the body in the future.  All the future attempts to reanimate
<BR>
bodies would fail.  But there is no way that mortal scientists could win a
<BR>
tug-of-war with an omnipotent God and force a soul to return against His
<BR>
will.  So, I'm not worried that future doctors be able to remotely screw up
<BR>
the afterlife.
<BR>
<P>If God controls the time of my death, and He choose a specific time that is
<BR>
best for me, they why would he allow the cryonics to succeed?  If all
<BR>
attempts to save my life failed, because it was written in God's cosmic
<BR>
plan, how could the last-ditch attempt succeed?  If God didn't want me
<BR>
cryonically frozen, I'm sure that something would go wrong and my cryonics
<BR>
plans would not materialize.  Something would go wrong and I would probably
<BR>
get cremated instead.  If God has such plan for me, I'm sure they would
<BR>
override my plans.  So I'm not worried that my feeble attempts will somehow
<BR>
thwart God's cosmic plan.
<BR>
