<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; We extropians like to have fun, but all people have an aversion to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  looking foolish....it takes work to overcome it. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually it's quite apparent -- after reading this list -- that many of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here seem to have NO aversion to looking foolish. That is: as long as we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not aware of it ; - )
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  I have no aversion to looking foolish even when I *am*
<BR>
aware of it.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>OK lets modify the name to ExtroWise day.  I thought of another
<BR>
scheme here to baffle future tyrannies.  We can write a java script
<BR>
which will go into our own sent-email archives and randomly select
<BR>
a sentence here, a sentence there, creating email messages apparently
<BR>
from us which have all the same keyword hits but of course are pure
<BR>
gobbledygook.  The script will be set to run at some off-time,
<BR>
or perhaps as a background process, then every morning at say
<BR>
0300 it would mail out several hundred fake emails to a fake
<BR>
address, set up by oneself.  Then those emails should be as much
<BR>
a permanent record as all your real emails, which would then comprise
<BR>
only ~1 percent of your total outgoing email.  If one is ever held
<BR>
accountable for something in an email, one can claim it was
<BR>
computer generated nonsense.  spike
