<EM>&gt; Michael and Joe exchanged a set of messages with relatively

<P><EM>&gt; So if you *knowingly* post a message to the list that is designed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do nothing more than &quot;tease the dog&quot;, then you should think twice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note: I include *myself* in this category!  If you want to &quot;tease
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dog&quot; do it in private with the dog, not on the list.  I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admit there is a fine line here in using rhetorical devices to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get someone to see your point and simply stirring the muddy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waters.  It takes careful re-reading to determine whether you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are trying to keep things at DEFCON 1 or 2 or whether you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seeking to push them to DEFCON 3 or 4.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Heck, back during that flamewar, I tried to point out to Dees that most
<BR>
of the policies he advocated were *already* law, and he just blew it off
<BR>
and went on with his confrontational style.  That's when I plonked him. 
<BR>
My advice to other list participants: consider the rhetorical style and
<BR>
signal/noise ratio of various posters, and decide for yourself if a
<BR>
particular poster is worth reading.
<BR>
<P>I drew my own conclusions a while back- that Lorrey has some hot buttons
<BR>
that can easily be avoided, and that Dees goes straight into my trash
<BR>
folder simply for being rude and uninteresting (not because of his
<BR>
views).  Now this might be seen as teasing the dog, but I calls 'em as I
<BR>
sees 'em.
