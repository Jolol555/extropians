<EM>&gt; it seems to be getting more and more

<EM>&gt; politically incorrect to try to extend human

<P>No, I think you're right. But let's hope that changes.
<BR>
<P>Actually, preventing &quot;diseases associated with aging&quot; will almost certainly
<BR>
happen via a retardation of aging per se (though with many diseases, this isn't
<BR>
_necessary_). Thus, the goal most can agree on -- &quot;old people should feel more
<BR>
vital&quot; -- will be achieved in such a way that the old people will live
<BR>
considerably longer. It may be that the &quot;day of cultural reckoning&quot; to which
<BR>
Greg refers won't ever happen, qua _day_, qua &quot;moment,&quot; because anti-aging
<BR>
progress will be gradual, and norms will be reset slowly enough that their
<BR>
change won't be accompanied by a lot of noise.
<BR>
<P>I think most of the ethical controversy will surround the means used to slow
<BR>
aging, and these means (stem cell replacement, cloning, etc.) will be used in
<BR>
lots of other research, so the end won't enter the debate so centrally. But if
<BR>
someone finds a way, in the near future, to STOP aging entirely, there will
<BR>
certainly be controversy.
<BR>
<P>We'll see (I hope...).
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
