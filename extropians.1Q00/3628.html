&nbsp;Actually, Nathaniel Branden, in applying Ayn Rand's philosophical principles 
<BR>
&nbsp;to the study of consciousness, made at least a really fine start in his 
<BR>
&nbsp;original &quot;The Psychology of Self Esteem.&quot;  Arthur Koestler also did some 
<BR>
&nbsp;really nice analysis of various aspects of the non-digital sides of 
<BR>
&nbsp;consciousness in such works as his &quot;The Act of Creation, in which he does 
<BR>
&nbsp;define and validate a full explanation of humor, among other things.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Non-digital,&quot; by the way, does not mean &quot;non-rational.&quot;  It's just that 
<BR>
&nbsp;consciousness is fundamentally different in structure from any computational 
<BR>
&nbsp;device out there, including so-called neural nets, altho they are a step 
<BR>
&nbsp;closer.

<P>Yes I have red both, but they aren't ( weren't in Koestler's case) 
<BR>
neruologists or cognitive scientists. What the heck WAS Koestler, anyway, a 
<BR>
paleontologist??
