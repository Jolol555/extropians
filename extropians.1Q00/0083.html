<EM>&gt;I found the references to various studies regarding male and female

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;patterns and rates very interesting.  I did not realize to what extent

<EM>&gt;there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is female on male violence.  Where this is done outside of self-defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is no excuse for it but a key thing here is(at least where a weapon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not used) that men tend to be substantially larger and stronger then there

<EM>&gt;partners and so are in a position of power where they can do much more

<EM>&gt;psychological (intimidation) and physical harm.

<P>The largest study ever done on domestic violence, involving detailed 
<BR>
interviews with 23,000 victims revealed that in 70% of the cases, the woman 
<BR>
instigated the violence.  Typically she would keep escalating until the man 
<BR>
responded, at which point the police would be called and the man arrested - 
<BR>
about 98% of the time back then (this was three or four years ago, as i 
<BR>
recall).  Since then, due to pressure from ultra-anti-male-feminist groups, 
<BR>
the laws have been changed to instruct the police to arrest the predominant 
<BR>
source of the violence.
<BR>
The change was introduced to try to increase(!) the percentage of men 
<BR>
arrested, but in fact it had exactly the opposite effect and suddenly a 
<BR>
sizeable percentage of women were being arrested - but still far from the 
<BR>
majority.  Then the police started using female officers in the arrests and 
<BR>
surprise, surprise, the percentage of females arrested rose even more - to 
<BR>
about 20%, last I heard.
<BR>
A lot of violence is done against men who are in fact weaker than their 
<BR>
wives, such as crippled, paralized, elderly, infirm, sick, etc., men, which 
<BR>
is not at all uncommon, as men typically are older than their wives and 
<BR>
generally take more physical risks during their lives.  There are a LOT of 
<BR>
cases of serious physical violence against helpless men by wives, but they 
<BR>
are hardly ever reported, and of the tens of thousands of abuse shelters the 
<BR>
study checked on, only seven in the entire U.S. would admit men.
<BR>
(Now the same feminists who introduced the change in the law are trying to 
<BR>
have it changed back...)
