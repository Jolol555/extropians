<EM>&gt; |Perhaps, but two points.  One, I'd rather not rely on the incompetence of

<EM>&gt; One: For me it felt natural to conclude that one should avoid unnecessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      data shadows, since those who believe themselves the ``government''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      will surely use that data against oneself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Two: Apparently those who call themselves ``government'' in the ``USA''
</EM><BR>
area
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      have not perfected their methods, considering the fact that they
</EM><BR>
started
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      the so called ``War on Drugs'' and have consistently lost it against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      low technology types.  The Norwegian nazis simply reused the old data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      collected by the previous people which called themselves
</EM><BR>
``government''.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To stop the spies doing the puzzle, keep your piece.

<P>I don't see why you brought this up.  My comments above were prefaced on the
<BR>
notion that one would not help the census form out.  I.e., why give them any
<BR>
help?  But I thought you and the rest would know that.
