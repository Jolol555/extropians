<P>
On Politics and Transhumanism,
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics is really the way large groups of humans interact as 
<BR>
communities.  While transhumanism is not a political movement, it is true 
<BR>
that some people may see the need or utility of getting involved in politics 
<BR>
to advance the hopes and dreams of transhumanism.  Some will do this as 
<BR>
independents, others by trying to introduce transhumanist thought and values 
<BR>
into already established groups, and some will feel the need to come together 
<BR>
as a group to place issues of concern to transhumanism into the public eye.  
<BR>
The people in this last group will naturally want to identify their party as 
<BR>
inspired and guided by transhumanist principles, though by no means will they 
<BR>
be representative of the entirety of transhumanist thought.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that transhumanism has a lot to offer people, that is why I have 
<BR>
been spreading the word about transhumanism at work, in my region, and among 
<BR>
my family.  It is a chance to bring transhumanism to people who have not yet 
<BR>
been exposed to it, and get good feedback in the process.  To bring it into 
<BR>
the life of the community, I encourage people to use the method of 
<BR>
association they feel most comfortable with, whether it be independently, as 
<BR>
part of the current establishment, or as part of a new &quot;transhumanist&quot; 
<BR>
movement.  Just remember, transhumanism is more than politics.
<BR>
