<P>
<EM>&gt; 	lets say we locate the entire source code to windows 2000. does that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disprove the existance of windows 2000? heh wtf. pardon my ignorance, but:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i lurked the entire first battle of the qualia war, and it still seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me that to use the terms &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot; supports a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaningless distinction. it seems to me that, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;experience&quot;/&quot;Experience&quot; distinction is to hold, we should call dim light
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;light&quot; and bright light &quot;Light.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>As, I believe, I am the originator of the &quot;experience&quot;/Experience
<BR>
distinction, I want to provide some defense for it.  I hope at the same
<BR>
time to show that no argument which does not beg the question can prove
<BR>
the existence of qualia, and why not assuming the existence of qualia from
<BR>
the outset, in an important sense, begs the question against qualia.
<BR>
<P>When I say Experience, in capital letters, I mean the Feelings you get
<BR>
when you have sensory impressions.  In that respect, whenever something
<BR>
Appears to you to be anything, you are, by definition, having an
<BR>
Experience of it.  Thus, the very fact that something Appears to you to be
<BR>
anything at all demonstrates that you are having Experiences.
<BR>
<P>When I say &quot;experience,&quot; in lower case and in quotes, I simply mean a
<BR>
certain type of behavior or physical state.  You can check whether someone
<BR>
is having an &quot;experience&quot; by looking purely at their outsides; if they act
<BR>
in just the right sort of way, they are having an &quot;experience,&quot; else,
<BR>
they're not.  In Waiting for Zed, Clark uses the word &quot;intelligence&quot; to
<BR>
represent a certain set of behaviors and capacities which are purely
<BR>
physical and causal.  In this use of &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;intelligence,&quot; it
<BR>
doesn't make sense to &quot;appear&quot; to be having &quot;experiences&quot; or to &quot;appear&quot;  
<BR>
to be &quot;intelligent&quot; without actually being &quot;intelligent&quot; or without
<BR>
actually having &quot;experiences;&quot; since the appearance of being intelligent
<BR>
and the &quot;appearance&quot; of having &quot;experiences&quot; is just what we mean by those
<BR>
terms.
<BR>
<P>Early on in the previous qualia war, I raised the following skeptical
<BR>
concern: How do you Know that you're having Experiences?  The obvious but
<BR>
clearly unsatisfactory answer is:  &quot;Well, it Appears to me that I'm having
<BR>
Experiences, and that alone is sufficient to show that I AM having
<BR>
Experiences.&quot;  &quot;How do you know that it even Appears to you that you're
<BR>
having Experiences?&quot; the skeptic might reply. &quot;Well, it Appears to me that
<BR>
it Appears to me that I'm having Experiences, and THAT is sufficient to
<BR>
show that I'm having Experiences.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is begging the question against the skeptical argument, however.  
<BR>
The skeptical question should, in point of fact, be phrased:  How do you
<BR>
know that you're having Experiences, or that you Appear to be having
<BR>
Experiences, or that you Appear to Appear to be having Experiences, or
<BR>
that you Appear to Appear to Appear to be having Experiences, etc.?  How
<BR>
do you know ANY of these?
<BR>
<P>In light of THIS skeptical concern, simply appealing to Appearances again
<BR>
misses the point.  However, as with most difficult skeptical problems, the
<BR>
obvious answer is to shake one's head and say &quot;Well, listen, I can't PROVE
<BR>
to you that all of these are true, but it's an axiom.  I have to assume
<BR>
that it's true.&quot;  (If you haven't yet found the need to do this in the
<BR>
face of some skeptical concern, I reccomend that you do some more
<BR>
philosophy, especially in the study of logic/math or in epistemology.)
<BR>
<P>So the existence of qualia is not derivable from an axiom set which does
<BR>
not beg the question.  But who cares?  That's why we have axioms, after
<BR>
all: some things are true but not derivable from an axiom set which
<BR>
doesn't assume their truth.
<BR>
<P>Well, we next point out that from this smaller axiom set, not only is the
<BR>
existence of qualia non-derivable, but the NON-existence of qualia &quot;seems&quot;
<BR>
quite likely.  We could, the argument goes, ALL be zombies, all just be
<BR>
simple information processors with no internal Experiences whatsoever.  
<BR>
We might be influenced to claim that we have Experiences by some other
<BR>
physical cause, but there might not be any actual Experiences at all. And,
<BR>
when we actually get into the brain and start studying it, it &quot;appears&quot; to
<BR>
me that there really IS no non-physical mechanism at work in the brain,
<BR>
and therefore no Mental mechanism at work in our behavior.  So when we do
<BR>
the science at look at the brain, it &quot;appears&quot; to me that everything can
<BR>
be explained without invoking qualia, that is, we have no need of that
<BR>
hypothesis.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I have no need of that hypothesis&quot; is what Kepler is said to have claimed
<BR>
when he argued for his planetary orbit theory over the prevailing theory,
<BR>
which involved angels moving the heavenly bodies directly.  (&quot;Where is God
<BR>
in your model of the universe?&quot; they might have asked him.)  It's a code
<BR>
phrase for the application of Occam's Razor.  When you have no need of the
<BR>
hypothesis, so the saying goes, you ought not make the hypothesis.
<BR>
<P>So it &quot;appears&quot; to us that we have no need of that hypothesis, and
<BR>
therefore, when we do not assume that qualia exist, it is quite likely
<BR>
that they don't.
<BR>
<P>[Personal pet peeve:  Whenever I use the terms without quotes or capitals,
<BR>
I use the term according to the sense of the word in quotes, not in the
<BR>
sense of the term in capitals.  Yet whenever I leave off the quotes, and
<BR>
say things like 'It appears that qualia do not exist,' people take great
<BR>
pleasure in pointing out that I used the word 'appears,' thus proving that
<BR>
their argument is correct after all.  They would have no motivation to
<BR>
make this argument if I'd said:  'It &quot;appears&quot; that qualia do not exist,'
<BR>
and time and time again I insist that THIS is the sense in which I use the
<BR>
word, not in the sense of Appearance.  You watch, someone will try to use
<BR>
this argument again, and, I assure you, it will really &quot;piss me off.&quot;]
<BR>
<P>So now we're in quite a bind, because the acceptance of a qualia axiom
<BR>
offers us a one-line proof, and many people are quite motivated to accept
<BR>
this axiom on account of the fact that it may line up well with how they
<BR>
currently view the world.  However, the NON-acceptance of a qualia axiom
<BR>
leads one to conclude that we should reject qualia, and therefore, of
<BR>
course, we should reject a qualia axiom.
<BR>
<P>So on what grounds should we accept a qualia axiom?  On what grounds
<BR>
should we reject it?  Can any account of qualia be given which does not
<BR>
beg the question against a qualia skeptic?  The skepticism alone has not
<BR>
convinced the believers, and the axiom, naturally, hasn't convinced very
<BR>
many non-believers.  How can debate move forward from this point?
<BR>
<P>It's difficult to imagine.

<BR>
<P>PS On an unrelated point, I do not think that anyone should quit debating
<BR>
the matter for my sake.  Kill files work, if you insist, but I don't use a
<BR>
kill file: the delete key ALSO works.  It is a weird kind of arrogance to
<BR>
think that everyone else on a list ought to shut up about a topic which
<BR>
interests them, simply because someone finds it boring.
