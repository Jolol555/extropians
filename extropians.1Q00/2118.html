<EM>&gt; If the show was negative -- I didn't see it -- has anyone decided to write

<EM>&gt; to Fox and say that portrayal was unfair?

<P>Thinking it over, I reverse my earlier stance: the Fox show was about
<BR>
as balanced as I would expect.  If they had been positive about
<BR>
cryonics it mighta started to look like an infomercial.  They had a
<BR>
deathist on there urging people to just die and let our grandchildren
<BR>
run the show [he *assumed* we have offspring], they had
<BR>
David Brin, who was more or less neutral [saying current corpsicles
<BR>
have ~5% chance of drawing a breath sometime in the future], and
<BR>
Merkel whose stance was predictable.  {8-]  Overall, perhaps it
<BR>
is better to present a moderate view of cryonics than a positive one,
<BR>
for even if it gives us a 5% chance, it is infinitely better than the
<BR>
current two alternatives.  Brin's 5% isnt all that different from my
<BR>
own estimate of cryonics eventual success, altho I have been
<BR>
moving more toward the optimistic in the past year or two.
<BR>
<P>I propose the Merkel as a standard unit of optimism for cryonics,
<BR>
with Ralph's attitude defined as 1 Merkel.  I am only at a couple
<BR>
hundred milliMerkel now but gaining several microMerkel per day.
