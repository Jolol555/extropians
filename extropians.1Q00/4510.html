<P>New Procedure Destroys Lung Cancer In China Study 
<BR>
JACKSON, Mississippi, U.S.A. -- All of the PET scans were crystal clear. 
<BR>
Every cancer cell was killed in the targeted zones where lung tumors once had 
<BR>
grown. 
<BR>
The news was everything that was hoped for by Dr. Patrick Sewell, an 
<BR>
assistant professor of radiology and surgery at the University of Mississippi 
<BR>
Medical Center (UMC) in Jackson, Miss. The results of his China study 
<BR>
confirmed the medical viability of his new pioneering surgical procedure. 
<BR>
<P>All nine follow-up PET scans indicate this new procedure is killing 100 
<BR>
percent of targeted tumors, Sewell said in a March 7 press conference at the 
<BR>
medical center. His final surgery was completed the night of March 3 in 
<BR>
Guangzhou (pronounced &quot;gwan-zO&quot;), China, just before his return to Jackson 
<BR>
from the 16-day-trip. 
<BR>
<P>These findings could give lung cancer patients a favorable alternative to 
<BR>
traditional treatments and change the way lung cancer surgery is performed 
<BR>
worldwide. 
<BR>
<P>Sewell developed the interventional radiology procedure -- called 
<BR>
radiofrequency of the lung tumor ablation -- and is considered the world's 
<BR>
authority on it. He performed it for the first time in the world at UMC about 
<BR>
a year ago. The Guangzhou, China, Study marked the first time the procedure's 
<BR>
effectiveness on primary tumors was tested and the first time follow-up PET 
<BR>
scans were performed. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's so good for the patients,&quot; Sewell explained, &quot;that they can be treated 
<BR>
so completely, so quickly, so safely and so cheaply with this procedure. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It makes perfect scientific sense,&quot; he added. &quot;But, emotionally, it's beyond 
<BR>
belief to see patients come in and go so quickly and their tumors are 
<BR>
treated. Even as much as I believe in this procedure, it's still hard to 
<BR>
believe.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Dr. Ralph Vance, an oncologist and UMC professor of medicine, said, &quot;In the 
<BR>
20 years I've been treating cancer, this procedure has the potential for 
<BR>
being the greatest thing that's ever come about.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Vance accompanied Sewell on the first trip to China, in October, and designed 
<BR>
the protocols for the surgeries in the latest trip, which officially is named 
<BR>
the Guangzhou, China, Study. 
<BR>
<P>The procedure kills cancer with a radiofrequency (hot) probe, which is 
<BR>
inserted into tumors and guided by interventional CAT scan images. Within a 
<BR>
day or two after their surgeries, all of the China patients had follow-up PET 
<BR>
(positron-emission tomography) scans, which detect metabolic activity in live 
<BR>
cells, such as cancer cells. 
<BR>
<P>The successful results also came earlier than expected in the process. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Initially, we were going to do some of the PET scans early and some in about 
<BR>
four months because we didn't know if the immediate scans would provide clear 
<BR>
evidence of killed (cancer) cells,&quot; said Dr. Thomas Lawson, a pathologist and 
<BR>
director of clinical affairs for Radio Therapeutics Corp., the U.S. company 
<BR>
that manufacturers the probe. &quot;After all, nobody had ever seen a PET scan on 
<BR>
thermally treated lung tissue, until now. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;But the results were conclusive,&quot; Lawson added, so all of the PET scans were 
<BR>
conducted immediately. &quot;There's no reason to wait.&quot; Radio Therapeutics paid 
<BR>
for the PET scans, which cost $2,000 each. 
<BR>
<P>The Guangzhou, China, Study ideally was to have 10 patients. Sewell saved the 
<BR>
10th patient position for Jackson. He will perform the study's 10th surgery 
<BR>
at UMC in the next several weeks. 
<BR>
<P>The study's aim was to prove this procedure kills both metastasized (cancer 
<BR>
that has spread) and primary (non-metastasized) tumors of the lung. Only 
<BR>
tumors that were isolated and surrounded by healthy tissue qualified for the 
<BR>
study, so follow-up PET scans could clearly evaluate the treated area. 
<BR>
<P>The first PET scan result came in Feb. 26. It showed no metabolic activity in 
<BR>
the tumor area treated, nor in the area immediately surrounding the tumor, 
<BR>
which also was treated. That indicated all cancer was killed in the targeted 
<BR>
zone, Sewell explained then. &quot;There is increased metabolic activity, however, 
<BR>
around the dead tumor's location, which is a natural result of the thermal 
<BR>
injury&quot; to healthy (non-cancerous) tissue. &quot;This is exactly what we would 
<BR>
expect to see,&quot; he said Feb. 26. That ring of metabolic activity around the 
<BR>
treated zone was caused by healing of the area heated by the probe. 
<BR>
<P>In the year Sewell has performed this procedure at UMC, all but one of his 
<BR>
American patients had metastasized lung cancer. One, who underwent surgery 
<BR>
shortly before the China trip began, had primary lung cancer. In the United 
<BR>
States, primary lung cancer traditionally is treated with conventional 
<BR>
surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation. 
<BR>
<P>Among the nine Chinese patients: five had primary tumors with no indications 
<BR>
of metastasis, two had primary lung tumors with metastasis and two had 
<BR>
metastasized cancer that had spread to the lung from other locations. 
<BR>
<P>The nine patients, who ranged and age from 38 to 78, had surgeries that 
<BR>
lasted from 40 minutes to 4 3/4 hours. Four were women. All were Chinese. 
<BR>
Their tumors ranged in size from a dime to a grapefruit. 
<BR>
<P>No China patient required general anesthesia. Eight were treated with local 
<BR>
anesthesia and one was treated with local anesthesia and heavy sedation. 
<BR>
<P>In Sewell's procedure, there is less trauma to the body and a much shorter 
<BR>
recovery period than for conventional surgery or chemotherapy. His procedure 
<BR>
is much less expensive than conventional surgery and/or chemotherapy. After 
<BR>
his procedure, patients usually go home within a day or two. 
<BR>
<P>Five of the Chinese patients underwent surgery at the Tumor Hospital of 
<BR>
Guangzhou. The other four had their surgeries at one of three Shanghai 
<BR>
hospitals. He also lectured physicians in Beijing, Xi'an, Guangzhou and 
<BR>
Shanghai. As few as a dozen and as many as five bus loads of Chinese 
<BR>
physicians observed each of Sewell's procedures. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;We're naming the study for Guangzhou because they were the most enthusiastic 
<BR>
and they found the most and the best patients for the study,&quot; Sewell said. 
<BR>
&quot;The also are a hospital devoted to the treatment of tumors.&quot; 
<BR>
