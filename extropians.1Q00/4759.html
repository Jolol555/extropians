<EM>&gt; &gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights

<EM>&gt;to

<EM>&gt; &gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not at the expense of rational discourse about the real problems and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solutions- if gun rights activists are painted as violent antisocial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irrational paranoid maniacs (the general drift of that cartoon), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes it difficult to calmly analyze the situation.

<P>Political satire is long recognized as a valuable tool in the social tool 
<BR>
kit.  However I don't think there is any danger of cartoons preventing 
<BR>
rational discourse among those who prefer to seek it out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<P>I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is neither 
<BR>
pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had called the NRA 
<BR>
and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational paranoid maniacs,&quot; 
<BR>
*that* would be pejorative.  If my quoted phrase offends your sensibilities, 
<BR>
I would suggest that you are ill prepared to engage in any passionate 
<BR>
debate.
