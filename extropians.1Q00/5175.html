<P>
With regard to adding &quot;energy&quot;, it is important to realize that there
<BR>
is really no such thing as &quot;pure energy&quot;.  Energy is an accounting
<BR>
convention, representing the ability to do work.
<BR>
<P>There are many forms of energy: heat energy (random molecular motion),
<BR>
kinetic energy (organized motion), potential energy (due to gravitational,
<BR>
electric, or other fields), radiation energy (carried by photons),
<BR>
and so on.
<BR>
<P>Most people are assuming that photons are &quot;pure energy&quot;.  It is true that
<BR>
photons have no rest mass, but I think it is better to think of them
<BR>
as particles that carry energy.  An ordinary particle carries kinetic
<BR>
energy as well, unless its velocity is absolutely zero (which will never
<BR>
happen exactly).  A photon also can carry different amounts of energy,
<BR>
arbitrarily close to zero.
<BR>
<P>The energy carried by a photon is not invariant, but depends on the
<BR>
motion of the observer.  Move towards the photon and its measured
<BR>
energy increases (blue shift), move away and it decreases (red shift).
<BR>
The same effect is seen with kinetic energy carried by a massive particle.
<BR>
<P>When people were talking earlier about &quot;becoming beings of pure energy&quot;
<BR>
that is really much more ambiguous and less meaningful than might be
<BR>
thought.
