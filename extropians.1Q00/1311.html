<EM>&gt;Sorry I don't have more time to post on these threads. I feel that I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should, especially since I teach a class in Philosophy of Religion. So, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just a few points made briefly (well, more briefly than I'd like):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AGNOSTIC AND ATHEIST:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Though I always prefer to describe my views in positive rather than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;negative terms, if asked    (about the traditional God) &quot;are you an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atheist&quot;, then my direct answer would be &quot;yes&quot;. I think it is a mistake to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say that you should be an agnostic because you cannot prove that there is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no God. There are many things I cannot prove do not exist. My example in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;class: there is an invisible, intangible alien elf who lives on top of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Empire State Building who uses a mysterious mind control technology to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increase conflicts among people to weaken us ready for an alien invasion. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Do I believe this being exists? No. I am an a-elfist, just as I am an atheist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Atheism = a-theism = lack of belief in a God. Lacking belief does not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;automatically imply you can *prove* there is no such thing. While I find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it almost impossible to make sense of the Christian idea of God given the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state of the world, I cannot prove that our universe was not created by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some higher power, perhaps even something much like the Christian/Muslim 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;God. I just see no positive reason to believe this, many strong reasons to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doubt it, and so lack belief.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>Hypostatization is the phenomenon of believing that because
<BR>
some people use some word, therefore the word actually stands
<BR>
for something or has a referent.
<BR>
<P>So, a very basic question to theists, agnostics, atheists alike:
<BR>
When you use the word &quot;god&quot; what are you talking about? What
<BR>
are you referring to? What is the referent for your word &quot;god?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Usually, when you ask this question and further question
<BR>
whatever answers are given, you end up with nonsense similar
<BR>
to &quot;the elf on the Empire State building.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I haven't yet similarly asked people what they're talking about
<BR>
when they use the word &quot;soul.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Just because 99.999...% of people use words like &quot;god&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;soul&quot; as if valid, doesn't necessarily signify that anything
<BR>
other than hypostatization is involved.
<BR>
<P>If someone says to me &quot;ooblegoob&quot; exists, can you disprove
<BR>
its existence? I reply that nothing has been said that
<BR>
establishes a need to prove or disprove anything. &quot;Ooblegoob
<BR>
is simply a nonsense word.
<BR>
<P>A man once said to me, &quot;There's green cheese in the middlle
<BR>
of the moon. People who believe this are greencheesists.
<BR>
Those who don't know are agnogreencheesists. Those who
<BR>
don't believe are agreencheesists. Those who believe the
<BR>
whole universe is made of green cheese are pangreencheesists.
<BR>
Which one of these are you?
<BR>
<P>I replied, &quot;Sorry, I'm none of these.&quot;
