<P><EM>&gt; Awww hell Anders!  Now Ill hafta be embarrassed by not only all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the stupid things I did and said, but all those I managed to *not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do as well?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably.  Fortunately, the rest of us will get to watch, so you
<BR>
can have some consolation that at least someone will get a chuckle
<BR>
out of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; She rolled down the window, he reached in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grabbed her bichon frize and threw it onto the freeway, with predictable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh.  I'm lost in the French accented Caltalk here.  What the blazes is
<BR>
&quot;bichon frize&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Today the news says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virginia emailed DMV photos of the owners of every Virginia-licensed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black explorer!  Is this not an unprecedented thing?
</EM><BR>
<P>The DMV employees must have seen &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;, otherwise they
<BR>
would have never figured this out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nextly, transparent world fans and info nudists: I can easily imagine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my own natural lifetime, being able to sit down at a computer, type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in any name and have some future version of the web go out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collect every stupid thing that person ever posted, ever, by searching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thru achives, etc.  Does this change the way we post?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  Some of my posts to Usenet longevity &amp; life-extension
<BR>
from '91-93 are still floating around.  Reading them gets very scarey
<BR>
because I really am a different person now.  Though I still stand
<BR>
behind most of the assertions I made, it seems like I no
<BR>
longer have the knowledge on which the assertions were based.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if in ten years I'll consider being an Extropian a similar
<BR>
phase in my development?
