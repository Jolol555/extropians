Is that really making it more interesting, or just more of a hunt. I
<BR>
hear that men enjoy the hunt more than the act, but this takes the cake!!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I think many men do get a major endorphin rush when they realize their 
<BR>
efforts to gain sexual access to a woman are going to be successful.  This 
<BR>
can take place at various stages.  You must remember, we guys generally do 
<BR>
not hold the cards sexually (the female does) and so must do all we can to 
<BR>
encourage the female, realizing we very well may fail in our attempts.  It 
<BR>
is a risky proposition and so sometimes very exciting.
<BR>
<P>I read an anecdote in a book on human sexual experience about a man who was 
<BR>
a &quot;bored casanova&quot; and was excited to pursue a woman and get her to agree to 
<BR>
go home with him but after that the interest would leave him because he 
<BR>
actually felt burned-out about doing the sex act.  He was a &quot;catch and 
<BR>
release&quot; sort of guy.

PS Well, personally speaking, I'm pretty sure I enjoy the act(s) more than 
<BR>
the hunt. The hunt seems pretty much like a waste of time.  Much better 
<BR>
would be an encapsulated exchange of information that determine whether or 
<BR>
not mutually acceptable criteria and interests are satisfied.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>The hunt is not a waste of time in the sense of developing social skills to 
<BR>
be more successful, not just in the hunt but life in general.  Think about 
<BR>
how many men (and women too) put massive effort into being prepared for the 
<BR>
hunt (of a long-term mate, especially) by working hard in school, developing 
<BR>
skills and talents(music, for instance), getting a good education and 
<BR>
working hard in their career so they can be financially successful.  They 
<BR>
are building up their &quot;social currency&quot; so they can get the best short and 
<BR>
long-term partners they can!  The human race is better off for us having 
<BR>
this drive.
<BR>
<P>While we have sophisticated dating services now that try to match-up 
<BR>
compatible partners, there are some intangibles out there of chemistry that 
<BR>
one should not overlook.  I have seen people &quot;hooked up&quot; by friends or 
<BR>
dating services where everyone thought it would work out well but it did 
<BR>
not.
<BR>
<P>A book on human sexuality I highly recommend to everyone who wants to learn 
<BR>
about what really drives them is, &quot;The Erotic Mind&quot; by Jack Morin.  His 
<BR>
&quot;paradoxical perspective&quot; shows how passion is generated by a mixture of 
<BR>
attraction plus obstacles to overcome.  Negative emotions can even be 
<BR>
powerful aphrodisiacs.
<BR>
<P>When I read this book it really blew me away.  I saw myself and the girl I 
<BR>
was dating at the time in a totally new light.  Anyone really interested in 
<BR>
why people get sucked into relationships needs to read this, no matter how 
<BR>
much you know this will greatly add to it.

As a monogamous female, not prone to bragging &quot;I got laid last night&quot;, the 
<BR>
idea of going on 10,000 dates with 10,000 lawers, engineers, architects, 
<BR>
doctors, bodybuilders or whatever, and listening to 10,000 evenings of 
<BR>
conversation about them, with their sole intent being finding one right sex 
<BR>
partner - my hair stands on end.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>By being female, monogamous and beautiful you don't need to brag because you 
<BR>
hold a strong hand of cards.  I have been on dates where the other person 
<BR>
talked and talked about their one right life partner who was somewhere out 
<BR>
there... to the point my hair stood on end!

I think your comment proves my point. Now we accept this process as part of 
<BR>
being &quot;human&quot;. Since it is &quot;moderately&quot; successful for some subset of the 
<BR>
population it survives as a common human activity.  If on the other hand the 
<BR>
costs were *much* higher to achieve the &quot;goal&quot;, we would expend the energy 
<BR>
required to make it much more efficient.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Well, in some cultures (even now but especially anciently) they had parents 
<BR>
and marriage brokers decide who you would marry.  Allowing the child to 
<BR>
decide was tempting disaster in their view! lol  And there are those couples 
<BR>
in arranged marriages today that swear by it.
<BR>
<P>As knowledge of human psychology improves I can see dating services becoming 
<BR>
more successful at bringing people together.  I read a delightful story a 
<BR>
few years ago (I can't recall the author or title, sorry, I will make a 
<BR>
search) about neuroscientists in the mid 21st century who find incredibly 
<BR>
accurate ways of measuring compatibility.
<BR>
<P>A young researcher early on in the project finds a wife through it.  But as 
<BR>
the years go by and the techniques are refined he realizes his wife is only 
<BR>
a 88% match and there is a woman in the database who is in the upper 
<BR>
nineties for him!  He is tortured as to what he should do.  It is a great 
<BR>
short story and I will try to track it down.

Social and biological scientists would presumably expend much more energy 
<BR>
exploring compatibility criteria and we would presumably get a refined 
<BR>
process rather than the hit-or-miss situation we seem to currently have.  
<BR>
The once-in-a-blue moon physical compatibility issue would make it much 
<BR>
simpler, our embedded watch-agents would inform us that only on February 28, 
<BR>
2117 would our physical equipment be in sync sufficiently to allow mating. 
<BR>
In the meantime, we could relax and simply get to know each other and find 
<BR>
out what we might have to offer (other than sex) that would be of mutual 
<BR>
interest.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>But so much happens based on environment and the unique stressers there to 
<BR>
bring people together.   Intangibles that seem to just fall into place at 
<BR>
times.  Maybe with quantum computing, dating services can really be 
<BR>
effective! lol

I've shown this to so many gals but when I tell them the plane is not mine 
<BR>
they lose interest! :(  lol
