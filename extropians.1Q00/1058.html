<P>
<EM>&gt; The way this is phrased got [Robert Bradbury] to thinking --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Why do we have such a &quot;magical mystery cult&quot; about a collection of cells?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   [I'm probably going to get eaten alive for that statement -- bygones...]
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert I know you will endure a lotta crap for this, but I grok your
<BR>
message.  Abortion is one of those hot button subjects, second only
<BR>
to those devices which hurl small lead objects at high speeds.  But it
<BR>
not not be.  Seems we should be able to dissociate the emotion from
<BR>
abortion, if we wish.  Looks to me like we have now or will soon
<BR>
have the technology to selectively block the action of any hormone,
<BR>
and we should be able to figure out which of these causes us to have
<BR>
such strong emotional response to abortion.  Then block it.  Then
<BR>
make the decision for parenthood based only on intellectual criteria,
<BR>
leaving emotion, religion, hormonal drives, etc. completely out of
<BR>
the question.
<BR>
<P>Then perhaps we would have a world in which *all* children that
<BR>
are born are children that are *wanted*.  spike
