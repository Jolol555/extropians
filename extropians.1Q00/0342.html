<P>
If you've never felt pain you wouldn't know what pleasure is.  Perhaps this is not
<BR>
quite so, ie, there is a difference between pleasure and ambiguity, but it is along the
<BR>
same lines as yin/yang, perhaps even Jungianism.
<BR>
<P>That is not the same thing as to not say noone deserves to have pain applied.  It is
<BR>
morally wrong to inflict pain.  Thousands of Kurds die each year, mainfully assumedly
<BR>
quite painfully, war is not moral.
<BR>
<P>Some choose physical or other pain as a side-effect of growth in return for
<BR>
development.
<BR>
<P>Physical pain is largely the body's nervous alert system. It is largely its sensitivity
<BR>
interrelating with the capacity and propensity of man's inhumanity to man and to
<BR>
inflict physical pain that imbues it its psychological weight.
<BR>
<P>So, there can be classified physical con/contra emotional pain, they are quite
<BR>
different.
<BR>
<P>Side note:  political correctness is political correctness.
<BR>
<P>I appear to have drifted, the subject of this e-mail is about memetics thus memes.
<BR>
Visually, the word &quot;memes&quot; looks like it could be pronounced &quot;mee mees&quot; when it is
<BR>
pronounced &quot;meems.&quot;  The mass media is its own meme.

<EM>&gt;     &gt;anyone else can do will flip that sign to positive.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is wise, true, and very well said! In fact, if that is not a fundamental axiom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of morality then I would have absolutely no use for morality. But it is and I do.
