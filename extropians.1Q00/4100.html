H. G. Wells had to be at least a great proto-extropian. He didn't talk of
<BR>
personal immortality, but perhaps he lived at too early a time for that. But
<BR>
most of the other ideas are there. I wonder how many people he influenced?
<BR>
I'm not certain whether I saw his motion picture Things to Come (from his
<BR>
book, Shape of Things to Come) before or after reading Arthur C. Clarke's
<BR>
Profiles of the Future, but I think it was first.
<BR>
<P>The final scene-the dialogue between Cabal and Passworthy-had to have
<BR>
infected many people with the meme. By going over my videotape about fifty
<BR>
times I pieced it together for anybody here who doesn't have a copy, or
<BR>
perhaps hasn't heard it. Raymond Massey is masterful as both John Cabal and
<BR>
his great-grandson, Oswald Cabal. You owe it to yourself to get the tape.
<BR>
<P>Cabal's daughter and Passworthy's son have just been fired off in a capsule
<BR>
to circle the moon-in the face of a mob led by the luddite, Theotocopolis,
<BR>
portrayed by Cedric Hardwick. Cabal and Passworthy are looking up at the
<BR>
night sky. Cabal points up:
<BR>
<P>****************************************************************************
<BR>
**********
<BR>
<P>CABAL: 		There! There they go! That faint gleam of light.
<BR>
<P>PASSWORTHY:	I feel that what we've done is monstrous.
<BR>
<P>CABAL:			What they've done is magnificent.
<BR>
<P>PASSWORTHY:	Will they come back?
<BR>
<P>CABAL:			Yes, and go again and again, until the landing is made and the moon
<BR>
is conquered. This is only a beginning.
<BR>
<P>PASSWORTHY:	But if they don't come back-my son and your daughter! What of
<BR>
that, Cabal?
<BR>
<P>CABAL:			Then, presently, others will go.
<BR>
<P>PASSWORTHY:	O God! Is there ever to be an age of happiness? Is there never
<BR>
to be any rest?
<BR>
<P>CABAL:			Rest enough for the individual man, too much and too soon and we
<BR>
call it death. But for man no rest and no ending. He must go on-conquest
<BR>
beyond conquest. First this little planet and its winds and waves, and then
<BR>
all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about
<BR>
him, and, at last, out across immensity to the stars! And when he has
<BR>
conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time-still, he
<BR>
will be beginning!
<BR>
<P>PASSWORTHY:	But we're such little creatures! Poor humanity's so fragile-so
<BR>
weak-little-little animals!
<BR>
<P>CABAL:			Little animals. And if we're no more than animals, we must snatch
<BR>
each little scrap of happiness and live and suffer and pass-mattering no
<BR>
more than all the other animals do or have done. It is this-or that! All the
<BR>
universe or nothing! Which shall it be, Passworthy? Which shall it be?
<BR>
<P><P>****************************************************************************
<BR>
**********
<BR>
<P>Raymond Massey delivers his lines staring at the sky with an expression of
<BR>
fervor. As he says &quot;still, he will be beginning!&quot; his eyelids drop and the
<BR>
expression changes to ecstasy. Hearing those words the first time-&quot;still, he
<BR>
be beginning!&quot;-I felt my mind expanding. I felt a kind of intellectual joy,
<BR>
and the thought in my mind could only be described as something like &quot;Yes!
<BR>
Yes!&quot; That was a meme executed by a master. Hook, line and sinker!
