<P>Software Co. Sues Hackers
<BR>
<P>By TED BRIDIS, AP Technology Writer
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON (AP) - A company that makes popular software to block children
<BR>
from pornographic Internet sites filed an unusual lawsuit late Wednesday
<BR>
against two computer experts who developed a method for kids to deduce
<BR>
their parents' password and access those Web sites.
<BR>
<P>Microsystems Software Inc. of Framingham, Mass., which sells the widely
<BR>
used Cyber Patrol, asked U.S. District Judge Edward F. Harrington for a
<BR>
temporary restraining order requiring Eddy L. O. Jansson and Matthew Skala
<BR>
to stop distributing their ``cphack'' program immediately.
<BR>
<P>Skala, a Canadian graduate student in computer science, and Jansson,
<BR>
believed to be living in Sweden, published over the weekend on the
<BR>
Internet and in e-mail details about how to circumvent the filter
<BR>
technology in Cyber Patrol, which sells for about $30 and is widely used
<BR>
in many of the nation's elementary schools and libraries.
<BR>
<P>They also offered a small ``cphack'' utility for ``people oppressed by
<BR>
Cyber Patrol'' that, when run on a parent's computer, reveals the password
<BR>
that blocks questionable Web sites - and also discloses the product's
<BR>
entire list of more than 100,000 Internet sites deemed unsuitable for
<BR>
children.
<BR>
<P>``I oppose the use of Internet filtering software on philosophical
<BR>
grounds,'' Skala said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
<BR>
``The issue here was to see what does Cyber Patrol actually block. Parents
<BR>
have a right to know what they're getting and without our work they
<BR>
wouldn't know.''
<BR>
<P>In its legal filings, Microsystems said it suffered ``irreparable harm''
<BR>
from the publication of the bypassing software, which it said sought to
<BR>
destroy the market for its product by rendering it ineffective.
<BR>
<P>``The practical effect is that ... children may bypass their parents
<BR>
efforts to screen out inappropriate materials on the Internet,'' the
<BR>
lawsuit said.
<BR>
<P>Skala, a cryptography buff who attends the University of Victoria in
<BR>
British Columbia, said he spent about six weeks analyzing Cyber Patrol
<BR>
with Jansson's help via e-mail from Sweden.
<BR>
<P>``One could well question how much force of law (the legal filings) have
<BR>
in Sweden or in Canada,'' Skala said.
<BR>
<P>In an unusual legal strategy, Microsystems alleged that Skala and Jansson
<BR>
violated U.S. copyright law when they reverse-engineered Cyber Patrol to
<BR>
analyze it, which the company said is expressly prohibited in its license
<BR>
agreements.
<BR>
<P>Skala, who learned about the legal filings in Massachusetts from the AP,
<BR>
said he planned to speak with a lawyer but suggested that his work may be
<BR>
protected under a ``fair use'' clause of copyright law.
<BR>
<P>Microsystems also asked the judge to order the Swedish Internet company
<BR>
where the bypass utility is published to turn over records identifying
<BR>
everyone who visited the Web site or downloaded the program.
<BR>
<P>The company's lawyer, Irwin Schwartz, said damage to its product is ``at
<BR>
least at a minimum'' now because relatively few people were believed to
<BR>
have downloaded the bypass software.

Subject: CyberPatrol sues cryptanalysts who revealed flaws in it's software

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From: Ed Gerck &lt;<A HREF="mailto:egerck@nma.com?Subject=Re:%20CyberPatrol%20(Censorware)%20Sues%20Reverse-Engineers&In-Reply-To=&lt;v0422080db4f77dce09ba@[198.4.94.227]&gt;">egerck@nma.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't cope, sue.  The reverse-engineering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument, that it trespasses on property, was already
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used by Microsoft many years ago (ca. 1993) against Stacker.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Stacker (the then market leader for on-the-fly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disk compression software) found out that Microsoft had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pirated its code for disk compression in Doublespace, and sued
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micrsoft -- but Microsoft countersued saying that Stacker
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not have reverse engineered Microsoft's code without
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a court order. The argument is the same as if you think that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your stolen property is within a certain house -- you can't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trespass or invade the house in order to verify it, you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need to get a court order.  Stacker won in part, but lost
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot. As an aside, the then market leader (Stacker), now
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no longer even a player.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, what happened here is not new and those that want to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effectively combat &quot;hidden&quot; features, pirated code or covert
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weaknesses  by decompiling code should be aware of it. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end, however merit it may have, cannot justify the means.
<BR>
<P>Your point here is muddy; I'm not exactly sure what you're saying.
<BR>
<P>However, it sure sounds like you're saying that reverse-engineeering
<BR>
is equivalent to an unwarranted search of a person and their home, a
<BR>
violation of the US Fourth Amendment.  This is the wrong analogy, for
<BR>
at least two reasons, the first being, of course, that the people who
<BR>
did the reverse-engineering are -not- government actors.
<BR>
<P>The second reason is that this is truly the wrong analogy.  A closer
<BR>
analogy for the Stacker case would be to consider a case in which your
<BR>
copyrighted book was translated without your permission into a foreign
<BR>
language (clearly, a derivative work).  Is it then illegal for you to
<BR>
buy a copy of the book and have it translated back into its original
<BR>
language in order to see if infringement has occurred?  What about if
<BR>
the book jacket has language on it claiming that you have no right to
<BR>
do this?
<BR>
<P>The take-home conclusion, of course, is that prohibitions against
<BR>
reverse-engineering are evil and that any existing law to support it
<BR>
is a bad idea akin to eating our seed corn.
