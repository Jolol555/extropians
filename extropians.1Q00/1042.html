<P><EM>&gt;     Okay, maybe that wasn't the last thing.  I just want to say that I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against the use of most illicit drugs at this time.  It seems to me that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using current pharmaceutical technology to try to alter the mind is like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using a sledgehammer to hammer a screw into a precision clock...its a really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad idea unless you're desparate and that is all you have.  If you already 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a fairly healthy brain and functional mind, it seems like a poor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;risk/benefit trade-off to try to use current tech to improve it.  That's why 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would by and large limit drug use to treating illness.  Now the above 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned future techniques of localized, endogenous changes to brain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chemistry will likely have the necessary level of finesse to try to upgrade 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious mood and experience.  So for now, I recommend staying off drugs 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unless you need them, and work on biotech and nanotech (or are they one in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same&lt;g&gt;).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with this as a personal choice, but not as a restrictive policy.
<BR>
<P>Decriminalization of drugs and their research now would allow to start work on
<BR>
adjusting personal attitudes and social regulations to reliance on personal choices
<BR>
and responsibility, rational discussion on acceptable risks, grow research labs
<BR>
and educational groups discovering and teaching personal work in alternate
<BR>
states, etc, etc.  - these are issues that will take much longer to resolve than
<BR>
the technology.  Delaying these most crucial issues, we are setting up the
<BR>
mildest technological advances to potential violent social conflicts.
<BR>
We already have hundreds of thousands of people regularly raped in jails
<BR>
for attempts to gently modify their perception with such mild and non-
<BR>
addictive things as pot and psychedelics.  What is worse for their mental
<BR>
and physical health?
<BR>
<P>Everest climbing is riskier than any drug that has ever existed, and yet it's
<BR>
glorified rather than persecuted.   Hamburgers are worse for your health than pot.  
<BR>
Do do not want to establish a comprehensive Nazi control over personal risks,
<BR>
but rather prepare the social environment as fast as possible to handling an
<BR>
unprecedented flood of possibilities for personal modifications - some of
<BR>
them finer than current drugs, some much stronger - because we really don't
<BR>
have enough time...
