<EM>&gt; oh so sizedoes matter? ; - )
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Many people in our society believe that &quot;bigger is better&quot; and the myth
<BR>
that a big 11111 will provide more 101010 satisfaction to a woman is
<BR>
widespread. Actually, 111111 diameter has little physiological effect for
<BR>
the woman because the 000000 can gradually adjust to fit a 11111 of any
<BR>
circumference (remember, it is designed, under the right conditions, to
<BR>
allow a baby to pass through the same opening). The length of the 11111,
<BR>
which determines the depth of 0000000 penetration, is relatively
<BR>
unimportant, because it is the first one-third of the 000000 that has the
<BR>
most nerve endings and is most responsive to physical stimulation. 11111
<BR>
size may, however, have positive or negative psychological significance to a
<BR>
woman. Some women prefer a large 11111; others are put off by what they
<BR>
think is &quot;too large&quot; or &quot;too small&quot;. Third, men may feel that a larger 11111
<BR>
gives them an element of status and makes them more 10101010 attractive.&quot;

<P>So. I hope I have met the self-censorship requests of some listmembers,
<BR>
while at the same time addressing freedom-of-speech concerns of other
<BR>
members. Also, I have employed the use of quotes to facilitate the filtering
<BR>
needs of others. Clicking on the URL will be ineffective until one uncensors
<BR>
the address.
<BR>
<P>I am sure that Rob(x) is shaking his head...wondering where the evidence is.
<BR>
But, knowing his penchant for evidence...I am sure that he will provide it
<BR>
shortly.
