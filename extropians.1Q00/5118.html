<P><EM>&gt;  I favor keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proven intimidating abusers, and the mentally incompetent and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deranged, and ONLY them.  I have no problem whatsoever with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RESPONSIBLE gun ownership by the general citizenry (I own five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of them).
</EM><BR>
<P>So then WHAT is this persistent debate about, anyway? What
<BR>
person with normal awareness of public safety requirements
<BR>
and of the incidence of human injury and death by means of
<BR>
firearms could object on rational grounds to the following?
<BR>
<P>1] Convicted hyperaggressive felons should be denied legal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ownership of any lethal weapon, even if the enforcement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the law has intractable practical limitations.*
<BR>
<P>2] Spousal or child abusers who have either been convicted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of aggravated assault, assault with intent, etc. or known
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Child Protective or Welfare Agencies locally to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violent by history should be likewise denied ownership.
<BR>
<P>3] Anyone denied a license to operate a motor vehicle, for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever reason, should automatically be denied owner-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship of firearms. This would include alcoholic drivers,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;habitual  offenders and those who have thereby shown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a heedless and reckless disregard of the welfare, safety
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and security of the general public.
<BR>
<P>4] All individuals known to the local judicial system as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certifiably sociopathic or ambulatory psychotic should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denied ownership.
<BR>
<P>5] Hunters who have violated local laws pertaining to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of firearms for this purpose or otherwise engaged in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illegal hunting practices should be denied ownership.
<BR>
<P>6] ANYONE known by properly constituted authority to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legally irresponsible in the use of firearms for ANY purpose,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including collecting, selling, trading or the mechanical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alteration of firearms should be denied ownership.
<BR>
<P>7] The retailing of firearms should be limited to, without
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exception, state-owned stores, just as in some states
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liquor sales are currently regulated.
<BR>
<P>8] ALL firearms owned by private individuals should be com-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prehensively registered with an appropriate local law-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforcement agency. Private trading should be banned.
<BR>
<P>9] Penalties for first time and repeated offenders should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal to or greater in severity than those that currently
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apply to violators of motor vehicle laws. A point system
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or other device could be used to determine when a license
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be suspended.
<BR>
<P>10] First time gun owners should be tested by written and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optical exams just as motor vehicle owners are now. It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not be required to be relicensed unless a violation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of firearms laws, statutes and ordinances was a matter of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;court record. (See -8- and -9-)
<BR>
<P>I cannot stress enough the revulsion I feel toward those who
<BR>
reject such rational social controls on the ostensible basis of
<BR>
some abstract idealist polity or manifesto using ad populum
<BR>
terms like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; to induce emotional support
<BR>
for irresponsible firearm ownership among those who are either
<BR>
socially incompetent, illiterate or simply too immature to under-
<BR>
stand the implications of such terms when applied to the real
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P>It is truly astonishing that, after the perhaps 2,500-year
<BR>
documentation of the human tendency to inflict violence on
<BR>
his own kind to achieve merely selfish ends, we still listen to
<BR>
those who advocate that some personal acquisitive desire
<BR>
should be regarded as superordinate to the welfare of the
<BR>
community upon which this individual depends. Any claim
<BR>
of privilege is forfeit by those whose very polemics are
<BR>
grounded in social indifference.
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
* This caveat applies to every stipulation; arguments against
<BR>
the regulation and control of the use, distribution, and owner-
<BR>
ship of firearms based on the difficulties inherent in applying
<BR>
laws and regulations are entirely specious. This argument is
<BR>
reduced to absurdity by demonstrating that, for the same reason,
<BR>
NO laws or regulations should be enacted within a community in
<BR>
behalf of the general welfare.
