From: Howard Rothenburg
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Then why are the governments that regulate their populations the most the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones with the worst environmental problem areas (even where officially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have strict environmental protections laws).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If a company is using an environmental resource it has an incentive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protect it, at least enough so it can continue to use it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Governments, despite the rhetoric, seem to make the problem worse, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more they are involved.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;As I would agree with the idea of pretecting your resources for future use,
<BR>
the specifics of this logic doesn't seem to follow since a government would
<BR>
seem to have a *greater* stake in the environmental condition of its
<BR>
territory than would a company. With regard to governments, it is a matter
<BR>
of priorities. The former Soviet Union and eastern European countries put a
<BR>
much greater emphesis on economic development  than on protecting the
<BR>
environment. In other situations there is the problem of special interests
<BR>
within the governments exploiting their position.  We also have to remember
<BR>
that the trouble the United States has been digging itself out from under
<BR>
was done by primarily by companies government too and of course us with no
<BR>
or little regulation.  Based on the policies made companies or government
<BR>
can develop good or bad track records on environmental impact. And despite
<BR>
the rhetoric, for the most part, government regulation has done much more
<BR>
good than harm.
