<EM>&gt;As near as I can tell, this &quot;upgrade&quot; fellow is claiming to spend a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of time tracking pyramid schemes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never claimed to spend time on &quot;tracking pyramid
<BR>
schemes.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He can tell when a really good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pyramid scheme is starting, get in on the ground floor, and be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the people who gets paid off before the collapse occurs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Generally, as in the case of StockGeneration, I only get
<BR>
involved once a good track record has been established.
<BR>
With SG, I joined more than a year after it started. I
<BR>
immediately started telling others about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibility that people are making a living this way intrigues me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Clearly what the ecosystem needs is a hyper-hyper-hyperparasite who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would scam *them*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Of course, now that he's contacting others, the pyramid scheme must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approaching the collapse stage.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Because of the &quot;close-the-risk-window-as-soon-as-possible&quot;
<BR>
principle, it's difficult to scam me out of very much.
<BR>
<P>On several occasions, I've warned my contacts that a particular
<BR>
program looked to be in danger of collapsing. In the case of
<BR>
SG, I did so around April, 1999. It turned out that I was too
<BR>
cautious and overly pessimistic at that time. Around September,
<BR>
1999, I again felt that SG was doomed to collapse and informed
<BR>
my contacts of this. Again, SG proved me wrong. At the moment
<BR>
I see no imminent signs of collapse.
<BR>
<P>I probably would not have mentioned SG on this list, were it not
<BR>
for Rick Potvin's post on 1/9/00 and the responses to that post.
