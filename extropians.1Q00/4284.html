<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I mean, once we get past superstition and tyranny, we may discover that we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; need technology as much as we used to believe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would that be ok with you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Noooooooooooo!  Need more raging technology!  Homeresque, tongue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hanging out:  mmmmmm technoooologyyyyyy...
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gotta have it JR, otherwise we die too soon.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>This brings up an interesting issue I remember arguing with Nick about
<BR>
late at night at Extro3 (while Waldemar was doing an objectivist art
<BR>
critique in his sleep :-): how technology dependent is transhumanism?
<BR>
Suppose technology X is impossible, how does that affect
<BR>
transhumanism?
<BR>
<P>As I see it, transhumanism is not per se technology dependent. It
<BR>
strives to improve the human condition through rational means, but
<BR>
that is independent on which means are available. But transhumanism
<BR>
also has a kind of a &quot;subtext&quot; or stronger sense that says the human
<BR>
condition can be so radically changed through these means that it
<BR>
makes sense of talking about a transhuman or posthuman condition. This
<BR>
is much stronger than the first meaning, and also likely technology
<BR>
dependent - there doesn't seem to be any likely non-technological
<BR>
means to achieve this. 
<BR>
<P>So what happens if technology X is impossible? Suppose X is
<BR>
cryonics. Then a possible way of reaching the other posthuman
<BR>
possibilities before dying is closed, but people who are lucky or
<BR>
young enough to take advantage of new possibilities will become
<BR>
posthuman anyway. If X is nanotechnology a lot of exciting
<BR>
possibilities cannot be reached, but there are still ways of reaching
<BR>
a posthuman condition, even if it doesn't include utility fogs and
<BR>
matter compilers. If X is life extension, then things are bleak
<BR>
individually, but it is still no absolute limit of becoming (mortal)
<BR>
posthumans.  Going through our favorite technologies it seems like
<BR>
there is no single technology we *need*, there are a lot of useful
<BR>
technologies we would like to see developed but there are enough
<BR>
possibilities so that the failure of several technologies will still
<BR>
not mean the end of the posthuman dream.
<BR>
<P>What if all the transhumanifying technologies are impossible? While it
<BR>
might be that they are all physically impossible, there is a risk that
<BR>
(say) social developments makes them infeasible. Not terribly likely,
<BR>
but worth considering. Assume it is impossible to reach a posthuman
<BR>
level and the strong interpretation of transhumanism does not hold. Is
<BR>
transhumanism then pointless?
<BR>
<P>I would say this is not true. Even if I cannot expect to become an
<BR>
immortal transcendent superintelligence able to develop in
<BR>
inconceivable directions, I can improve my human condition through
<BR>
rational means. It is not as flashy, but I will still benefit. Dynamic
<BR>
optimism is good even if you live in the stone age. A rational,
<BR>
technology-friendly humanism can do a lot of good, and help overcome
<BR>
the superstition and tyrrany. Also, if the limits to development are
<BR>
not set by inflexible physical laws or insurmountable resource
<BR>
constraints but by social limitations, a transhumanism of the first
<BR>
kind can help overcome these limitations and bring about opening up
<BR>
further changes.
<BR>
<P>To sum up, I don't think transhumanism is dependent on technology, but
<BR>
limits on technology will also put limits on transhumanism. Totally
<BR>
without technology it just becomes a kind of humanism.
<BR>
