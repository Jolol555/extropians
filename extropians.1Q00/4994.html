<EM>&gt; What is the difference between a &quot;simple&quot; nanobot attack and a complex

<EM>&gt; nanobot attack?
</EM><BR>
A small number of nanobots designed to simultaneously release a relatively
<BR>
large quantity of a highly toxic poison long after they were delivered
<BR>
to your body.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If a zillion nanobots invade my body and commence to dismantle me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; molecule by molecule, is that a simple nanobot attack?
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems like a lot of work.  A flamethrower is probably a better approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you invision some vaccine to boost my immune system from this sort of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismantling?
</EM><BR>
<P>Your natural immune system probably cannot be re-engineered to resist
<BR>
what I would call a nanobot attack.  Diamondoid/Saphire nanobots are
<BR>
pretty hard to take out with bio-nanotech.  As was suggested you will
<BR>
need an engineered nano-immune system.  These will be natural outgrowths
<BR>
of bio-engineering of stronger immune systems (i.e. immune systems that
<BR>
cannot, no way, no how become infected with HIV).  There will be a lot
<BR>
of discussion about various types of attacks and various defenses that
<BR>
must be engineered against them.  Fortunately we have nature to use
<BR>
as a blueprint for what works and one would hope the good guys should
<BR>
outnumber the bad guys so the defenses stay ahead.
