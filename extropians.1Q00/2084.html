<P><EM>&gt; As I and others have pointed out, the best model is to produce

<EM>&gt; the &quot;copyrighted works&quot; cheaply enough that it eliminates the

<EM>&gt; incentive to &quot;steal&quot; work.

<P>This is what has happened in Hong Kong with video compact discs (VCDs),
<BR>
the most common format for movies.  The real licensed VCDs only cost US$5
<BR>
or less now, because they have to compete with pirates.  Even so, rampant
<BR>
piracy here has very seriously impacted the local music and film
<BR>
industries.  Pop record sales are down 50% from their peak five years ago,
<BR>
and the film biz is in even worse shape.
<BR>
<P>Which leads to a related question which has been on my mind a lot lately,
<BR>
wonder if any of you Extropians can shed fresh light on this:  how can
<BR>
musicians (or other creative types) make a living from their work in an
<BR>
age of perfect digital copying?  Mp3s are just the beginning, after
<BR>
all...when everyone has broadband access and massive hard drives we won't
<BR>
even need to compress the files, we'll just keep them at CD-quality as
<BR>
wavs or aifs.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas?
<BR>
<P>Personally, I haven't bought many CDs since six months ago because I
<BR>
usually listen to Internet radio or mp3s.  I'm not even talking about
<BR>
piracy, there is so much FREE music by unsigned artists out there if you
<BR>
take the time to look, and personally I really enjoy finding interesting
<BR>
new music that no one else has even heard of...I was DJing last night in a
<BR>
club here and played quite a number of unknown tracks from mp3.com.
