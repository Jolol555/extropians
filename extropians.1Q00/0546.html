<EM>&gt; If you actually understand what's going on in Chechnia, I'd love
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have it explained to me. Or rather, can anybody recommend any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointers on where to read up on this &quot;conflict&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>A good source for the English news is the Moscow Times (www.moscowtimes.ru).
<BR>
While this is &quot;popular&quot; press, they have a fairly diverse set of reporters
<BR>
so there may be coverage from many &quot;angles&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It all started with the Russian army moving into Dagestan to quell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some independence movement there. Then the Russians crossed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; border into neighboring Chechnia, supposedly only to hunt down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dagestan rebels who had fled there. Somehow this changed into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mop-up of all of Chechnia, and now we have another siege of Grosny.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dagestan is entirely forgotten.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I recall, because Chechnia was relatively stable the &quot;revolutionaries&quot;
<BR>
moved from there to Dagestan.  When the Russians moved in there, they
<BR>
decided to move back to Checnia, hence the Russians followed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't even know *who* the Russian army is fighting. &quot;Terrorists&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>There are large numbers of individuals from these Southern regions who
<BR>
want to be &quot;free&quot; from Russian rule.  Most of them probably want to
<BR>
be free of any rule/influence from anyone but those with whom they have
<BR>
strong ethnic/religious ties.  The people of most of these southern regions
<BR>
are &quot;dispised&quot; by &quot;caucasian&quot; Russians and there is no love lost on the
<BR>
religions differences (Greek/Russian orthodox vs. Muslim) as well.
<BR>
There is a very touchy economic issue involving who &quot;owns&quot; the oil in
<BR>
regions such as Baku, the Caspian Sea basin, as well as who collects
<BR>
&quot;taxes&quot; on the flow of oil over pipelines through their &quot;states&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Obviously some kind of guerillas. I mean, this is the Russian army.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who are those people that manage to put up what seems to amount to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly effective resistance? And what keeps the Russians from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crushing them? Lack of money? Commanders' incompetence?
</EM><BR>
<P>The Russian &quot;army&quot; (excepting a few elite divisions) is a bunch of 18-20
<BR>
year old conscripts with very little training, aging equipment and little
<BR>
funds.  The only reason the Russians can wage this campaign now is because
<BR>
the high oil prices are generating enough revenue to be spending billions
<BR>
of dollars on fuel and artillery (as well as making sure soldiers get their
<BR>
meager wages).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Political considerations? I can't believe that the Russian army is incapable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of putting an end to this quickly.
</EM><BR>
<P>They could, but the loss of life would be so large that it would be as
<BR>
unpopular as it was 3-4 years ago.  This is a double &quot;repeat&quot; for the
<BR>
Russians (after Afganastan &amp; the previous Chechnian war).  You should
<BR>
keep in mind that the major motivating force behind the war *is* political.
<BR>
An administration viewed as conducting a &quot;successful&quot; campaign against
<BR>
these &quot;filthy terrorists&quot; is going to be popular and get re-elected.
<BR>
In my darker moments, I wonder if the &quot;terrorist&quot; bombings in Russia, were
<BR>
not executed by rebels, but carefully arranged by an administration that
<BR>
needed them to justify starting a war that would be viewed, at least
<BR>
initially, as highly unpopular.
<BR>
<P>The Russians in their campaign are taking pages from the Gulf War and
<BR>
NATO campaign in Kosovo.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And where can I get information on what's going on in such situations?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Waiting ten years and reading the history books will probably lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the best quality information, but obviously this approach isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always applicable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  For the &quot;news&quot;, papers like the Moscow Times are not
<BR>
bad.  Certainly the Quebec situation has had a lot written about it
<BR>
though I'm unaware of any books.  Were there ever any books written
<BR>
about the American civil war that argued the South should have been
<BR>
able to leave the U.S.?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Grab land.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, this is where it gets messy, since then others have a territoriality
<BR>
claim against you.  It would seem to make more sense to &quot;grow&quot; land in
<BR>
international waters!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Declare independence.
</EM><BR>
<P>If its in international waters, you don't have to do this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Fight bloody war for independence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Win.
</EM><BR>
<P>If this can be avoided, its far better for everyone involved.  The trick
<BR>
is getting international recognition.  I prefer the &quot;grow your own island&quot;
<BR>
approach because (a) getting into space will be &quot;expensive&quot; until we have
<BR>
the power output of the sun at our disposal; (b) I believe current international
<BR>
treaties prevent &quot;claiming&quot; land in space (or at least on the Moon), so if
<BR>
you attempted executing this you would be creating a reason for the U.S. &amp;
<BR>
Russia to send a space destroyer after you.
<BR>
<P>An extropic approach, instead of repeating all the examples of previous
<BR>
mistakes, should try to focus on those areas where there are &quot;loopholes&quot;
<BR>
that people didn't envision due to limited previous meme-sets.
