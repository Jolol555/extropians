<EM>&gt; &gt; more  complex, more highly evolved, adaptive systems, organisms, and

<EM>&gt; &gt; No mystery here, and no supernatual cause at work. The natural order of the

<P>As I explained in another note the driving force would seem to be the  
<BR>
possibility of opening up untapped ecological niches.
<BR>
<P><P>[snipping comments by Robert &amp; Max on &quot;extropy&quot;]
<BR>
<P>As Max pointed out, the scientific term is &quot;negentropy&quot;.  It comes
<BR>
up alot in Robert's study of the evolution of life, &quot;Xenology&quot;.
<BR>
It is likely that J.R. meant this, since &quot;extropy&quot; doesn't really
<BR>
come into the picture until Max created it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Second, the issue is not how complex adaptive systems evolve, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why simple, unicellular adaptive systems evolve?
</EM><BR>
<P>Same reasons, if you can open up a new ecological niche, you can
<BR>
monopolize it for a while.  It becomes a self-propagating effect
<BR>
because the borders between the old/new niches or the over/under-
<BR>
populated niches then become the niches.  The reason there are
<BR>
so many species of bacteria and insects is because there are
<BR>
so many niches they can fill.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Third, I am afraid I find the statement &quot;The natural order of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe eventuates in genetic algorithms, organic chemistry, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Darwinian evolution&quot; completely meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert F. discusses it a bit in Xenology.  The universe is &quot;setup&quot;
<BR>
to allow molecules to form, that then get increasingly complex,
<BR>
that then may catalyze self-replication, that then may partition
<BR>
themselves from the rest of the world, that then become cells with
<BR>
genetic machinery, that then evolve into multiple ecological niches,
<BR>
changing those niches on planetary scales, that then get involved in
<BR>
all kinds of races for survival as they become increasingly complex
<BR>
until intelligence develops (turning hardware into software) and
<BR>
then cultures develop (allowing knowledge to accumulate beyond
<BR>
that of a single mind), and so on and so forth until the
<BR>
stars all burn out.
