<EM>&gt; &gt;Roundup soybeans are the exact OPPOSITE of this criterion!

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The purpose of making them resistant is so they can use more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Roundup, not less.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, but they use less of *other* herbicides.  It takes a complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cocktail to defend regular soybeans against dicots; with Roundup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soybeans you just need Roundup.  Also, they don't use more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; roundup on those particular soybeans; you can't you Roundup on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular soybeans at all.  It kills them as avidly as any weed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously Monsanto sells more Roundup in general.

<P>I think this commentary points out (with no negative press for
<BR>
either individual), how little knowledge the average American
<BR>
has about bio-agro-chemistry, actual farming practices and
<BR>
what goes on behind the curtain of their grocery store.  Contrast
<BR>
that with say most Russians who have to grow their own food and
<BR>
large numbers of city dwellers that are encouraged to go out into
<BR>
the fields to help harvest the potatoes every fall.
<BR>
<P>We are back again to the problem of &quot;should uninformed voters
<BR>
be allowed to vote?&quot;.  Now -- to push on this idea a little
<BR>
from an Extropian standpoint, most of us would strongly agree
<BR>
with the one-man-one-vote principle.  But, &quot;rationally&quot; can
<BR>
you make an argument that this will result in the best government
<BR>
when the people are either educated by &quot;sound bites&quot; or not at
<BR>
all?  One might look more at something like the judicial system
<BR>
where you vote for judges, but they have to demonstrate a fair
<BR>
amount of competency to their peers before they get on the ballot.
<BR>
We have precedents in the &quot;pratice of law&quot;, the &quot;practice of
<BR>
medicine&quot; -- should the realm of the environmental regulations for
<BR>
food, air, water, etc. be managed by those who are educated in the
<BR>
&quot;practice of science&quot;?  And then of course, what about the &quot;practice
<BR>
of government?&quot; (or does the current process effectively do that?)
