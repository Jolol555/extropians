<EM>&gt; &gt; As you point out, Robert, huge sums of money are already being diverted
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; health and longevity issues. In fact the desire for longevity is so
</EM><BR>
obvious
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the profits so sure, that it doesn't seem to me that anything other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than the market is needed to make it happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think a substantial desire for longevity -- and following from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, substantial future profits -- is in the least bit obvious.  It may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem that way from spending enough time on this list, but in casual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversation, I find people are generally opposed (often vehemently) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea of indefinite lifespan.  However, I think the general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population's opinions on death are highly swayable -- often deathist memes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are incongruent with the host's own values and beliefs, particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; athiests.  Often, people's opposition to death is just a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconscious irrationalism: overpopulation concerns, &quot;I will live on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through my children/ideas&quot;, &quot;Near Death Experiences prove the existence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an after-life.&quot;  They just haven't thought about it, and there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widely available information to set them straight.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with the last sentence there.  The thing I've found, as I've
<BR>
mentioned a few days ago here, is that if people are approached the right
<BR>
way, more agree with life extension then would be obvious.  If you ask a
<BR>
silly (to them) questions -- &quot;Aren't you for immortality?&quot; or &quot;Do you think
<BR>
we can completely stop and reverse aging?&quot; -- then they are unable to take
<BR>
that leap, especially if they aging and romanticize death.  However, you ask
<BR>
them &quot;baby steps&quot; questions -- such as &quot;Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of
<BR>
heart disease?&quot; or &quot;How about undoing the bad aspects of aging, such as
<BR>
wrinkles and a less active lifestyle?&quot; -- more people agree.  I think you
<BR>
must, in general, the latter should be asked first.  Get them used to the
<BR>
idea of less aging and a longer life, then spring more radical ideas on
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Which brings me back to what Natasha and Robert are saying.  People are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting against their self-interest.  They need to be educated,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; culturally.  Plain, old-fashioned marketing.  If there is any role for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NGO, it is education.  Once people are sold on the idea that a greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expanded lifespan is highly valuable for both themselves and most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people around them, the market demand and investment dollars will flow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naturally.  There is a mantra embedded in the collective consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Internet is the Future.&quot;  Seeing how that simple hypnotic phrase has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transformed our economy overnight, I can only imagine what the effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be after embedding a similar suggestion about longevity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like Kevin Kelly, I already think there is a market for this stuff.  That's
<BR>
why they are so many products and therapies marketed as &quot;anti-aging.&quot;
<BR>
However, this does not mean it is enough.  So, I agree with Geoff here about
<BR>
doing more through other means, such as an NGO to promote life extension.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there already are organizations which do so, such as the Life
<BR>
Extension Foundation (www.lef.org).  (I think they do a fine job, especially
<BR>
with their magazine, product line, funding of research, and legal battles
<BR>
with the government.)  So, those on this list who want to raise
<BR>
consciousness about this issue in the wider public might consider donating
<BR>
money to LEF.  Or turning other people on to its web site and related
<BR>
materials.
<BR>
<P>It would also be nice to have other means to promote the ideas.  An
<BR>
organized effort would be better, especially to counter various pro-death
<BR>
people and organizations out there.  Several years ago, e.g., I read a
<BR>
letter-to-the-editor by a clergyman in a local paper where I was living at
<BR>
the time.  The guy attacked cryonics as selfish because preserving one's
<BR>
body in hopes of future revival went against donating organs.  It would have
<BR>
been nice if someone had answered that letter.  (I wanted to, at the time,
<BR>
but was too busy to put together a rejoinder.)
<BR>
<P>For some of these things, such as responding to letters-to-the-editor or
<BR>
articles and news stories critical of life extension and immortalism, one
<BR>
doesn't necessarily need an organization.  Just being aware of what's out
<BR>
there and then reacting to it in a bold yet reasonable manner would help.
<BR>
For instance, if a newspaper, radio station, TV program, or webcaster covers
<BR>
a topic in a bad light for our cause, then be ready to contact it and give a
<BR>
rebuttal -- or pass the information along to those who are willing to do so.
<BR>
The Media are often quite willing to cover alternative views on the issue,
<BR>
but one has to let them know we (life extension and transhumanist/Extropian
<BR>
movements) are here.  Ditto for the average person.  He or she hasn't heard
<BR>
our views, for the most part.
<BR>
<P>(This does not mean one has to become a nag for these ideas -- constantly
<BR>
boring one's friends, family, and coworkers with life extension ideas.)
<BR>
<P>I think we can win in the marketplace of ideas.
