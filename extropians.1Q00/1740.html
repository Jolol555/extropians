<P>
There is a reasonable if slightly moldy online summary of common smart drugs
<BR>
at <A HREF="http://www.uta.fi/~samu/OLD/SMARTS2.html">http://www.uta.fi/~samu/OLD/SMARTS2.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Hydergine, Piracetam (Nootropil), and either Centrophenoxine or DMAE are
<BR>
reasonable choices.  Aniracetam may be a better choice than Piracetam, as it
<BR>
has greater evidence of being effective in improving memory in young (vs.
<BR>
aged) subjects.  
<BR>
<P>Bear in mind that these drugs tend to have synergistic effects and taking
<BR>
them in combination usually magnifies the dose significantly.  If you take
<BR>
more than one, consider ramping up your usage slowly and one drug at a time,
<BR>
giving yourself time to acclimate and note any changes that occur when you
<BR>
add a substance to your cocktail.
<BR>
<P>A word on effectiveness:  There are a few indications that are at least some
<BR>
of these substances in high dosages are effective in improving long term
<BR>
memory in mammals.  However, the size of the effect seen here is small, and
<BR>
there is no evidence of impact on short term memory (which is more closely
<BR>
correlated with problem solving and general intelligence).  Also note that
<BR>
the evidence on long term memory suggests that it is dosage of the drug
<BR>
during *encoding* of the memory that is most relevant (rather than during
<BR>
*retrieval* of the memory).
<BR>
<P>What is more clear is that a large number of drugs classified as nootropics
<BR>
are powerful neuroprotectants, likely to protect against ageing, anoxia, and
<BR>
cognition-degrading drugs.  So from that perspective use may well be
<BR>
justified.  I would set your expectations fairly low as far as immediate and
<BR>
obvious effects on your current cognitive powers, though.

<EM>&gt; I'm looking for advice and experience with Nootropics--I'm 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in Hydergine and possibly Nootropil, but is there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything that any of you take that might also work well? I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that there are several things out there that could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualify as &quot;workable&quot;, I'm just not sure what to take.
