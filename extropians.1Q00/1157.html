Looks to me like we have now or will soonhave the technology to selectively 
<BR>
block the action of any hormone,and we should be able to figure out which of 
<BR>
these causes us to havesuch strong emotional response to abortion. Then 
<BR>
block it. Thenmake the decision for parenthood based only on intellectual 
<BR>
criteria, leaving emotion, religion, hormonal drives, etc. completely out 
<BR>
ofthe question. Then perhaps we would have a world in which *all* children 
<BR>
thatare born are children that are *wanted*.
<BR>
(end of reproduction)
<BR>
<P>Spike my friend, what planet do you live on? :)  You're talking about 
<BR>
emotional and irrational human beings who love and lust for each other based 
<BR>
on so many individual and cultural factors!  Actually, religion, emotions 
<BR>
and hormones can be positive forces at in causing couples to want to bring 
<BR>
children into the world and nurture them.
<BR>
<P>But I'm sure that Vulcan parents would quite agree with you, at least before 
<BR>
pon farr kicked in!  But that's why they arrange the marriages ahead of 
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P>To have a world where every child is loved, have everyone be genetically 
<BR>
engineered to be sterile until they consider themselves ready.  Then the 
<BR>
procedure is reversed temporarily with medication.  To be prescribed the 
<BR>
meds a person must take parenting classes and show they can provide for the 
<BR>
child.  Of course alot of people would not like this endeavor in social and 
<BR>
genetic engineering.
<BR>
<P><P>live long and prosper,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg  :)
