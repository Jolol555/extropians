The study of consciousness is burdened by too much
<BR>
speculative philosophy, and not enough empirical science.  It's
<BR>
important to observe real-life examples of many seemingly
<BR>
theoretical states of consciousness important for cryonics
<BR>
and uploading already exist.  These can be observed and discussed
<BR>
to a much greater degree:
<BR>
<P>1.  &quot;zombies&quot;: sleepwalkers are nearly fully functional but
<BR>
not in an aware state of consciousness.
<BR>
<P>2. reanimation of consciousness after termination of mental
<BR>
activity: sleeping and normal unconsciousness are *not* examples
<BR>
of this.   However, hypothermic accidents and surgery are
<BR>
examples.   Hypothermic surgery in particular is a goldmine of
<BR>
data on the persistence of consciousness if we care to study
<BR>
it closely.
<BR>
<P>3. cloning of consciousness: experiments on split brain
<BR>
patients (slicing through the corpus collosum) seem to indicate
<BR>
that something like two conscious entities, one verbal and
<BR>
observable, the other nonverbal and difficult (but not
<BR>
impossible) to observe, exist in such people.   This suggests
<BR>
that the boundaries between conscious minds are caused by the
<BR>
relative connectedness of the computing networks which create
<BR>
those minds.
<BR>
<P>4. blindsight: unconscious sensing of the environment without
<BR>
conscious qualia.
<BR>
<P>We can do far more than merely philosophize about what might
<BR>
happen in such situations.   We can observe them and discuss
<BR>
these observations.
