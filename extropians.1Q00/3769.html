*grins* of course, a more interesting plan would be to get the internet 
<BR>
*into* the poor children... if we had the technology. I say, to every person 
<BR>
a plug, and to every plug, an ethernet hub! *grumbles*
<BR>
(end)

<P>Aha!!  So Skye is going to grow up to be the Borg Queen! :)  It would be 
<BR>
interesting to do this as a social experiment but the challenge would be 
<BR>
having a program to implement that could make a real change in the lives of 
<BR>
these kids and the economies they live in.
<BR>
<P>I would be worried that the plugs would get infected resulting in severe 
<BR>
illness and even death.  Considering how medical resources are so limited in 
<BR>
the third world this would be a possibility.
<BR>
<P>I have had my own thoughts regarding children of the future.  In the next 
<BR>
decade or two, I see a global blackmarket developing where China and India 
<BR>
will pay for female children because parents in those nations were so 
<BR>
myopically obsessed with having male offspring only.  It is a wonderful at 
<BR>
times but also horrible world we live in.
<BR>
