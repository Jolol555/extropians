<EM>&gt; I've always thought a Johnny Hempseed movement would be a good

<EM>&gt; idea.  No vacant lot, roadside, ditch, or park should be without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hemp.  It's a very hardy weed, should grow anywhere, or so say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hemp activists.

<P>According to my father it grows up to 1.5 metres high, along
<BR>
almost every road in areas of Siberia... This means that it
<BR>
probably should grow just as obnoxiously in the US.

<P><EM>&gt; One shouldn't be able to look at any non-landscaped public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property without bearing witness to the absurdity and futility of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making war against a plant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like fun :)  I'd really like to watch (from a great
<BR>
distance) how the US tries to get rid of a certain species
<BR>
of plant. It should be possible to start seeding it in the
<BR>
more obscure places so that it'll have grown too big to be
<BR>
eradicated when it's found.
<BR>
<P>But if you're interested in using it, be sure to pick another
<BR>
species than the one that grows in Siberia -- that one's
<BR>
completely THC-less :)
<BR>
<P>have fun,
