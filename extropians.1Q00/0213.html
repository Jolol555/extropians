<EM>&gt; &gt; From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20SOC:%20Opposition%20to%20Transhumanism&In-Reply-To=&lt;b49aemkkc92.fsf@sans04.nada.kth.se&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; You can be opposed against transhumanism and the things we hold dear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without being fanatic about them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...but not without being stupid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all. I can imagine intelligent and well-educated non-stupid
<BR>
people opposing transhumanism too, based on their values and knowledge
<BR>
of how the world functions. They are in many ways more troublesome
<BR>
than fanatics.
<BR>
<P>For example, imagine a sociologist who has studied the incidence of
<BR>
burnout in our society who comes into contact with transhumanist
<BR>
thinking. He will point out that the psychological effects of the
<BR>
tremendous changes and speed-ups we are proposing will lead to burnout
<BR>
and psychological distress on a massive scale, maybe so much that
<BR>
society will desintegrate. The transhumanists will of course claim
<BR>
that this will be fixed by technology , the adoption of transhumanist
<BR>
thinking and self-help as well as reconfigurations of human
<BR>
psychology. But the sociologist, drawing on his knowledge base in
<BR>
social psychology and history, will regard this hypothesis as highly
<BR>
unlikely to occur, in fact less likely than the hypothesis that this
<BR>
is just transhumanists defending their own worldview (you can do a
<BR>
completely correct Bayesian analysis of this situation and come to
<BR>
this conclusion - given the priors of the sociologist). We of course
<BR>
have slightly different information, and regard the first possibility
<BR>
as more likely (even if we should always ask ourselves how much is due
<BR>
to possibility two). So in the end he will disagree with us and if he
<BR>
considers us dangerous, try to move against us.
<BR>
<P>In the above example both sides could try sharing their analysis and
<BR>
facts, trying to make an analysis together both could agree on.  But
<BR>
even worse is if the basic values differ - a person valuing the
<BR>
eternal and unchanging would be opposed to us in principle, and there
<BR>
is no logical or emotional reason for him to change his values.
