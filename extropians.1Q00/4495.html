<EM>&gt; &gt; Thankfully, the technology for truly invasive stuff (BigBrother++)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; isn't there yet. Not quite. However, yes, I'm tracking what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; happening over in Albion, and no, it ain't pretty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's not as bad over here yet. Wanna come over, Charlie? Afterwards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there's always some hope for the lunar shuttle ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, but no thanks: the USA has exactly the same virus, it's just that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your political system conceals the symptoms a bit better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I decided (back in 1994, when the control-freak symptoms endemic in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; British political process were becoming glaringly obvious) to try the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how-to-get-an-elephant-up-an-oak-tree approach: move to Scotland and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wait for independence. It shouldn't take too many years -- given the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the control freaks in Westminster manage to annoy everyone north of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; border -- and the Scots are generally a bit less small-c conservative[*]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than their southern neighbours (modulo a few fringe religious groups).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the other hand, the lunar shuttle sounds quite appealing ...
</EM><BR>
<P>What does it take for a person of scottish descent who is a US citizen
<BR>
to immigrate to scotland? Of course, we Lorrey's were on the side of
<BR>
Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden (Clan Gordon), so we might be viewed
<BR>
as troublemakers...;)
