Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is a major cause of death in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the People's Republic of China (PRC), and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the geographic distribution of stroke death
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;varies substantially. We conducted an ecological analysis to investigate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the relationship of prevalence of hypertension and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other risk factors with stroke incidence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and mortality in the PRC. METHODS: The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship between prevalence of risk factors and stroke
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence and mortality in the PRC was assessed in 29
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;provinces by examining risk factor data from PRC national surveys and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence and mortality from the 1986 PRC National
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroke Study. RESULTS: A highly statistically significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;correlation between prevalence of hypertension and stroke
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence (r = .838, P &lt; .001) and mortality (r = .841, P &lt; .001) was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observed. Prevalence of hypertension explained over 70% of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the geographic variability in stroke
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence (partial R2 = .703) and mortality (partial R2 = .707) in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the PRC. There was a north-south gradient,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with a higher prevalence of hypertension and stroke
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence and mortality in the north compared with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the south of the country. In multiple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poisson regression analysis, a 10% increase in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prevalence of hypertension was associated with a 2.80-fold higher incidence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2.68-fold higher mortality from stroke, whereas a 10%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in the prevalence of alcohol consumption was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;associated with a 29% higher incidence and a 16% higher mortality from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stroke. A 10% increase in the prevalence of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cigarette smoking was associated with a 19% higher mortality from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In the PRC,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the prevalence of hypertension is strongly associated with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the risk of stroke, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the geographic variation in stroke
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence and mortality is due mainly to differences in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prevalence of hypertension.
