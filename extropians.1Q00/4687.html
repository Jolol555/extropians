<EM>&gt; Ahem! Yah! I am concerned about goons in &quot;black pot helmets&quot; destroying &quot;freedom&quot;. I am more concerned about ops tems from the Middle East or the Balkans taking out the Fernald Re-processing plant. I am even more concerned about KKK peeps calling themselves militias, murdering people without counter-veiliing force.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tell me please the last time a US citizens militia killed anyone? Hasn't
<BR>
happend yet, no matter what their political beleifs. Go point your
<BR>
paranoia someplace that matters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; And between the Alluah Akbars, and the Klaners minus hoods, I am suspecting that its the later that has brought forth the &quot;black helicopters O babylon&quot; to deal with them.  I wonder how many klaners would love to have nanotech to massacre off the &quot;mud people&quot; for their racial holy war?
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't know. Logic dictates that if they kill of all the 'mud people'
<BR>
that they won't have anyone to hate anymore and they'll have to get real
<BR>
beleifs and ethics. I'm sure they don't want that to happen, just like
<BR>
the anti-nukers don't want us to solve the problem of getting rid of
<BR>
nuclear waste, and the greenhouse effect protesters don't want us to
<BR>
solve the problem with nuclear power. Eliminate the problem and the
<BR>
whiners have to get real jobs.
