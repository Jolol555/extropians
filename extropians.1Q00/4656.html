Yeah that is pure BS, the only shortages in domain names are those being
<BR>
caused by their non-allowance of arbitrary new TLDs. ICANN sucks! What
<BR>
would be interesting is if you had some alt registries, and the linux
<BR>
people put it into their default distros so that all their users started
<BR>
using the alt registries, would that eventually cause the other OS vendors
<BR>
such as M$ to include support for the registries in their products? I
<BR>
am really surprised no one in linux-land has come up with the idea for
<BR>
&quot;open source&quot; registries not sanctioned by ICANN.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The only way to fight that fight is with money. Assuming you have gobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and gobs of it, you start your own domain name registration service, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; get ICANN, or WIPO or whoever it is now that oversees and approves new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; domain name registry services to let you get into the business. Possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; create your own new top level domains (rather than .com .net .web, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; use .sys, .inc, .corp, .home, etc....) Once you have done this, sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nope, no reason really to try to go through ICANN. No laws preventing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you from setting up your own registry right now. The trick is getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people's operating systems to utilize your registry. The DNS resolvers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of existing OSs can be setup to check whatever root servers you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like for a resolution, so it is not technically difficult to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people to use your service. You just have to somehow convince everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to setup their computers to do it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It would be nice to have some kind of system whereby DNS servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could automatically be notified of new registries, sort of like how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; newsgroups are created. The server admin can setup the dns server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to automatically add these new registries, or he can manually ok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them all. I really don't see a reason why not to do this. What is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the logic ICANN is using to not allow as many TLDs as people would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The logic is that the entire namespace belongs to the human race, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that that real estate needs to be preserved for the common benefit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all. Pure socialist hogwash, of course, but ICANN is now a major NGO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the UN. I can just imagine them sending UN Peacekeepers to occupy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your offices....maybe they'll just call you domestic terrorists and send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the new military Gestapo after you. Your argument has merit, possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you could start the process, then as you run into snags with acceptance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and possibly outright interference from ICAN, you could bring anti-trust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action against ICANN.
