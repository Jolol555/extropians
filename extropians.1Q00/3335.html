<P>&nbsp;BERKELEY-- A metabolic switch that triggers algae to turn sunlight into 
<BR>
large quantities of hydrogen gas, a valuable fuel, is the subject of a new 
<BR>
discovery reported for the first time by University of California, Berkeley, 
<BR>
scientists and their Colorado colleagues. The news appears in this month's 
<BR>
issue of the journal &quot;Plant Physiology.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;I guess it's the equivalent of striking oil,&quot; said UC Berkeley plant and 
<BR>
microbial biology professor Tasios Melis. &quot;It was enormously exciting, it was 
<BR>
unbelievable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Melis and postdoctoral associate Liping Zhang of UC Berkeley made the 
<BR>
discovery - funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Hydrogen Program - 
<BR>
with Dr. Michael Seibert, Dr. Maria Ghirardi and postdoctoral associate Marc 
<BR>
Forestier of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, 
<BR>
Colorado.
<BR>
<P>Currently, hydrogen fuel is extracted from natural gas, a non-renewable 
<BR>
energy source. The new discovery makes it possible to harness nature's own 
<BR>
tool, photosynthesis, to produce the promising alternative fuel from sunlight 
<BR>
and water. A joint patent on this new technique for capturing solar energy 
<BR>
has been taken out by the two institutions.
<BR>
<P>So far, only small-scale cultures of the microscopic green alga Chlamydomonas 
<BR>
reinhardtii have been examined in the laboratory for their hydrogen 
<BR>
production capabilities, Melis said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the future, both small-scale industrial and commercial operations and 
<BR>
larger utility photobioreactor complexes can be envisioned using this 
<BR>
process,&quot; Melis said.
<BR>
<P>While current production rates are not high enough to make the process 
<BR>
immediately viable commercially, the researchers believe that yields could 
<BR>
rise by at least 10 fold with further research, someday making the technique 
<BR>
an attractive fuel-producing option.
<BR>
<P>Preliminary rough estimates, for instance, suggest it is conceivable that a 
<BR>
single, small commercial pond could produce enough hydrogen gas to meet the 
<BR>
weekly fuel needs of a dozen or so automobiles, Melis said.
<BR>
<P>The scientific team is just beginning to test ways to maximize hydrogen 
<BR>
production, including varying the particular type of microalga used and its 
<BR>
growth conditions.
<BR>
<P>Many energy experts believe hydrogen gas one day could become the world's 
<BR>
best renewable source of energy and an environmentally friendly replacement 
<BR>
for fossil fuels.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Hydrogen is so clean burning that what comes out of the exhaust pipe is pure 
<BR>
water,&quot; Melis said. &quot;You can drink it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Engineering advances for hydrogen storage, transportation and utilization, 
<BR>
many sponsored by the U.S. DOE Hydrogen Program, are beginning to make the 
<BR>
fuel feasible to power automobiles and buses and to generate electricity in 
<BR>
this country, Seibert said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;What has been lacking is a renewable source of hydrogen,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>For nearly 60 years, scientists have known that certain types of algae can 
<BR>
produce the gas in this way, but only in trace amounts. Despite tinkering 
<BR>
with the process, no one has been able to make the yield rise significantly 
<BR>
without elaborate and costly procedures until the UC Berkeley and NREL teams 
<BR>
made this discovery.
<BR>
<P>The breakthrough, Melis said, was discovering what he calls a &quot;molecular 
<BR>
switch.&quot; This is a process by which the cell's usual photosynthetic apparatus 
<BR>
can be turned off at will and the cell can be directed to use stored energy 
<BR>
with hydrogen as the byproduct.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The switch is actually very simple to activate,&quot; Melis said. &quot;It depends on 
<BR>
the absence of an essential element, sulfur, from the microalga growth 
<BR>
medium.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The absence of sulfur stops photosynthesis and thus halts the cell's internal 
<BR>
production of oxygen. Without oxygen from any source, the anaerobic cells are 
<BR>
not able to burn stored fuel in the usual way, through metabolic respiration. 
<BR>
In order to survive, they are forced to activate the alternative metabolic 
<BR>
pathway, which generates the hydrogen and may be universal in many types of 
<BR>
algae.
<BR>
<P>&quot;They're utilizing stored compounds and bleeding hydrogen just to survive,&quot; 
<BR>
Melis said. &quot;It's probably an ancient strategy that the organism developed to 
<BR>
live in sulfur-poor anaerobic conditions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He said the alga culture cannot live forever when it is switched over to 
<BR>
hydrogen production, but that it can manage for a considerable period of time 
<BR>
without negative effects.
<BR>
<P>The researchers first grow the alga &quot;photosynthetically like every other 
<BR>
plant on Earth,&quot; Melis said. This allows the green-colored microorganisms to 
<BR>
collect sunlight and accumulate a generous supply of carbohydrates and other 
<BR>
fuels.
<BR>
<P>When enough energy has been banked in this manner, the researchers tap it and 
<BR>
turn it into hydrogen. To do this, they transfer the liquid alga culture, 
<BR>
which resembles a lime-green soft drink, to stoppered one-liter glass bottles 
<BR>
with no sulfur present. Then the culture is allowed to consume away all 
<BR>
oxygen.
<BR>
<P>After about 24 hours, photosynthesis and normal metabolic respiration stop, 
<BR>
and hydrogen begins to bubble to the top of the bottles and bleed off into 
<BR>
tall, hydrogen-collection glass tubes.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It was actually a surprise when we detected significant amounts of hydrogen 
<BR>
coming out of the culture,&quot; Melis said. &quot;We thought we would get trace 
<BR>
amounts, but we got bulk amounts.&quot;
<BR>
<P>After up to four days of generating an hourly average of about three 
<BR>
milliliters of hydrogen per liter of culture, the culture is depleted of 
<BR>
stored fuel and must be allowed to return to photosynthesis. Then, two or 
<BR>
three days later, it again can be tapped for hydrogen, Melis said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The cell culture can go back and forth like this many times,&quot; Ghirardi said.
<BR>
<P>###
<BR>
<P>Kinda neat in my opinion...
<BR>
<P>A couple of observations here.  Hydrogen gas (and propane and methane) 
<BR>
require a LOT of room to store....hence all the 'work arounds&quot; involving 
<BR>
liquidification and hi pressurization.  This is a bad thing for small 
<BR>
vehicles.
<BR>
<P>However...it's not such a bad thing for large vehicles. Does this mean that 
<BR>
&quot;heavy metal&quot; of the future will be even larger?
<BR>
<P>Right now my rig is seventy foot long by 102 inches wide....I regularly carry 
<BR>
oversize loads of up to 14 foot high by 12 foot wide.  If the infra structure 
<BR>
were to be slightly modified then a very large hydrogen fuel tank for rigs 
<BR>
similar to mine would not be overly difficult.  
<BR>
<P>Just wider roads and bigger parking area's is all....
