<EM>&gt; One additional note.  When all those old colonial powers left and went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home, you think they abandoned all that they had gained?  Yeah, right!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consider that they left in place all the legal structures which defined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property ownership, specifically, who it was that owned anything,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything, of value.  Then, though they had left, they maintained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationships with the &quot;new owners&quot;, continuing at some remove the flow of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefits achieved through the earlier &quot;colonial&quot; conquest.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yup.
<BR>
<P>One interesting explanation I heard: the history of Africa in the second
<BR>
half of the 20th century can be summed up as an inter-collegiate competition
<BR>
between Sandhurst and the London School of Economics. (Which were the two
<BR>
colleges where most of the first-generation post-independence leaders were 
<BR>
educated.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mike's right..  There's plenty of food.  It's human decency that's in short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supply.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thinking my way around the box, what we want is an Equalizer.
<BR>
<P>No a destructive one: a constructive one. A social Equalizer, as opposed
<BR>
to an anti-social one, equalizes people by giving them equal opportunities
<BR>
to live a better life. (An anti-social one removes opportunities. Think of
<BR>
a gun, pointed in your face by someone who wants all your money.)
<BR>
<P>A social Equalizer should be general-purpose. capable of training its
<BR>
owner in its use. It should be portable. It should be self-maintaining
<BR>
-- ideally it should be self-replicating -- certainly it must be very,
<BR>
very cheap. It should not be dependent on infrastructure: it should be
<BR>
able to go anywhere there are people, however destitute.
<BR>
<P>And it must provide opportunities.
<BR>
<P>Steering free of exotica like bush robots or utility clouds or personal
<BR>
immortality, what can we do with technology available _today_?
<BR>
<P>Take a look at the Handspring Visor. A PAlm Pilot clone that retails
<BR>
(the basic version) for about US $149.  (www.handspring.com). Today, this
<BR>
type of machine is basically a toy for rich yuppies and technology
<BR>
addicts in the developed world. But it could be a whole lot more.
<BR>
<P>Imagine a Visor that cost $15. Fantasy? No -- Moore's law is on our 
<BR>
side, and if in five years there's still a reason to produce 'em, this
<BR>
is what they'll cost.
<BR>
<P>Add wireless networking. Nothing flashy; it just needs to be able to do
<BR>
peer-to-peer networking at fairly low speed (sub-one megaherz). 
<BR>
<P>Add memory. RAM is cheap. Give it a chunk of extra RAM -- 64Mb, 256Mb --
<BR>
preferably as non-volatile storage.
<BR>
<P>Did I say non-volatile? Yeah. Coat the back in photovoltaics. The thing
<BR>
runs off 2 AAA cells and draws a peak of 70mA at 3V -- usually more like
<BR>
20-30mA. Photovoltaics and NiMH cells will just about double the $15
<BR>
price, but render it totally independent of external power sources.
<BR>
<P>Ruggedize the case a bit -- it's going to be used by ill-educated people
<BR>
who have no prior experience of high-tech kit. People who think an income
<BR>
of $100 a year is affluence. 
<BR>
<P>Now the tough bit; software.
<BR>
<P>It needs some sort of network discovery and routing protocol that will let
<BR>
a whole bunch of these things find out where each other are (within a
<BR>
short range -- 500-1500 metres? 3Km?). It needs to be able to make sure
<BR>
that information gets forwarded from one box to another until it gets
<BR>
where it's needed. Not the web; more primitive text-based stuff will
<BR>
do. Think gopher. Think e-mail. Think internet circa 1990 -- in places
<BR>
where high-tech communication previously meant a runner with a piece of 
<BR>
paper in a cleft stick. Some of the stuff developed for packet radio over
<BR>
the years would be directly applicable (I'm thinking of TCP/IP over
<BR>
AX.25). Or it may be something more modern. Never mind ...
<BR>
<P>It needs lots of information services behind it. Not glossy subscription- 
<BR>
based magazines and animated graphics, but useful, relevent information
<BR>
about everything you need to know to make life in a village that doesn't
<BR>
have running water more bearable (such as how to _get_ running water).
<BR>
And smart people who're going to add to the corpus over time and
<BR>
respond ahead of schedule to the user's needs. Think in terms of the
<BR>
equivalent of a well-stocked university library, but with content tailored
<BR>
to people who don't yet have access to tools -- or any education beyond
<BR>
basic literacy. (This is a tall order. How do you boostrap a literate
<BR>
economy out of nothing?)
<BR>
<P>It also needs to be self-teaching. One assumption: the user must be
<BR>
minimally literate before they start. But, given the very minimal ability
<BR>
to read, the machine should be able to teach the user everything else
<BR>
about how it's used -- not as a yuppie replacement for a filofax, but
<BR>
as a communications tool and a way of learning. Send barefoot teachers
<BR>
with a blackboard and chalk to teach reading, then give the students
<BR>
an Equalizer. Some of 'em will get used as hearth-bricks -- and some of
<BR>
them will be used as universities.
<BR>
<P>Now: what happens if you give everyone in Africa a cheap, rugged,
<BR>
infrastructure- free, open-source net terminal? 
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure, but it can't be any worse than what we've got today ...
