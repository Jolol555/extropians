<EM>&gt;this argument ... is saying that ethics is a branch of cognitive science,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because by cognitive analysis we can predict everything a person will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come to believe about ethics, and that is, from his perspective, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that he can ever know about ethics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If this is the argument, it seems to apply to all sciences.  Physics is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;branch of cognitive science because we can in principle predict everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone will ever know about physics.
</EM><BR>
<P>I accept that implication.  When you go and learn about physics for yourself,
<BR>
you can then use what you know about other people's brains to infer that
<BR>
they will likely come to the similar conclusions if they consider similar
<BR>
evidence.  You have then learned something about their cognition.  You can
<BR>
learn about what other people will think either by looking at their brains
<BR>
and how they think, or by looking at the things they are thinking about,
<BR>
and thinking about them yourself.  Both approaches are productive and
<BR>
have their place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A couple of problems I can see with this are, first, that there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophical difference between physics as a science and the part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics I will learn.  It may be that I am doomed never to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very much of physics, but that doesn't mean that the subject shares the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same limitations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, of course, a standard philosophical point.  We only ever learn
<BR>
about how we think the world is, and there may be things about the
<BR>
world we can never learn.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Second, for cognitive science to make such predictions it must have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access to all the empirical knowledge I will ever acquire.  Without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complete model of the universe, neither cognitive science nor any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;branch of science can make this kind of prediction.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I elaborated in my reply to Dan, exact predictions aren't needed for
<BR>
the general point that all we can know about ethics *is* an empirical
<BR>
question, in the same way that all we can know about physics is an
<BR>
empirical question.
