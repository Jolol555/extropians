<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; That's my opinion as well....that opinion is augmented by multiple
</EM><BR>
articles
<BR>
<EM> &gt; that can be found at the Junk Science WebSite..
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember that the Junk Science website is run by Steven J. Milloy.  He is a
<BR>
right-wing lawyer and lobbyist who is paid by the Republican Party and high
<BR>
pollution corporations to create scientific evidence to combat costly EPA
<BR>
and FDA regulations.  The science produced by these organization are
<BR>
dictated and funded by the right-wing political organizations.  Milloy then
<BR>
gathers scientists and evidence to support the desired scientific
<BR>
conclusions.
<BR>
<P>Steven Milloy is a lawyer, a lobbyist, and a right-wing political
<BR>
consultant.  He is not a scientist.  He is an adjunct fellow at the Cato
<BR>
Institute, which is a right-wing think-tank run by members of the Republican
<BR>
party in Washington, DC.  He runs the &quot;Citizens for the Integrity of
<BR>
Science&quot; from his own home, which is the &quot;third-party&quot; organization that
<BR>
supports his site.  He also runs Simusoft, Inc. out of his own home, which
<BR>
charges food companies to simulate food-testing results so that they can
<BR>
pass FDA regulatory requirements without the costs of actually running the
<BR>
tests.  He is the executive director of The Advancement of Sound Science
<BR>
Coalition which is a PR and lobbying company that is paid to fight food
<BR>
quality regulations.  He also runs the Environmental Policy Analysis Network
<BR>
which is paid to fight EPA regulations.  Milloy is employed by the EOP group
<BR>
as a lobbyist to fight pollution control regulations.  He creating the
<BR>
Information Council for the Environment which was later revealed to be a
<BR>
front organisation for the coal industry lobbyists to disprove
<BR>
global-warming.  Milloy was involved in the ICE scandal when it was later
<BR>
revealed that the organization had been paying scientists to support their
<BR>
anti-global-warming theories.   Another scandal involved a contest with cash
<BR>
prizes for the scientists who wrote the most letters supporting their cause.
<BR>
Milloy has also been caught holding up a paper that he claimed has the
<BR>
signatures of hundreds of scientists who supported his cause, only to have
<BR>
the list later proved to have been fake.
