New microscope catches individual atoms
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Using highly reflective mirrors,
<BR>
scientists said on Thursday they had created a kind of microscope that
<BR>
can trap and observe a single atom at a time.
<BR>
<P>The team, at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), said
<BR>
their &quot;atom cavity microscope&quot; takes them a step closer to quantum
<BR>
computers and communications.
<BR>
<P>Such technologies would be infinitely faster and more efficient than
<BR>
present-day computing and information systems.
<BR>
<P>Writing in the journal Science (<A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.com">http://www.sciencemag.com</A>), physics
<BR>
professor Jeff Kimble and colleagues said they created an optical
<BR>
cavity, which consists of a pair of highly reflective mirrors facing one
<BR>
another across a space of just 10 microns (0.0004 inches).
<BR>
<P>They create a weak field of light that traps the atom -- in this case a
<BR>
cesium atom -- in the cavity. The atom interacts with the photons in the
<BR>
light field and this interaction can be used to &quot;watch&quot; the atom.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The cavity is a resonator for light, like a half-filled soda bottle is
<BR>
for sound,&quot; Theresa Lynn, a graduate student at Caltech who helped write
<BR>
the study, said in a statement.
<BR>
<P>&quot;What we do is similar to holding a tuning fork up to the bottle and
<BR>
listening to hear it resonate. You'll only a hear a ring if the right
<BR>
amount of water is in the bottle.&quot;
<BR>
<P>To create a quantum computer, scientists say they will have to be able
<BR>
to measure atoms in ways not possible now. But such computers would be
<BR>
able to run huge numbers of calculations all at the same time, making
<BR>
them many times faster than present-day computers which use only two
<BR>
numbers -- 0 or 1 -- to calculate.
<BR>
<P>A quantum computer could use any amount of numbers.
<BR>
<P>Kimble said the experiment, described at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~qoptics/atomorbits/">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~qoptics/atomorbits/</A>, had two advantages.
<BR>
<P>&quot;On the one hand, it provides forces sufficient to trap the atom within
<BR>
the cavity at the level of single photons,&quot; he said. &quot;On the other hand
<BR>
and more importantly, the strong interaction enables us to sense atomic
<BR>
motion in a fashion that has not been possible before.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But it doesn't detect qualia...what a bummer.
