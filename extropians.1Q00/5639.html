Harvard Researchers have a model for Parkinson's in Drosophila.
<BR>
See:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/parkinsonsflies000322.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/parkinsonsflies000322.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Now, this is good because it sets the stage for putting genes
<BR>
that are involved in other pathologies of aging into flies.
<BR>
There are some limits to this.  For example, genes involved
<BR>
in skeletal structure, joints, arthritis, etc. couldn't
<BR>
be tested in a Drosophila model.
<BR>
<P>So here is a question (that I actually don't know the answer to...),
<BR>
What is the shortest lived mammal?  Or other short lived species
<BR>
that you could use as models for some aspects of aging in humans?
<BR>
I seem to recall vaguely there were some unusual animals from Australia
<BR>
that had short lifespans.  What about up there in Alaska, got any
<BR>
seasonal species John?
<BR>
<P>This isn't just a theoretical question, I've got a conference coming
<BR>
up this summer where we will be discussing a &quot;Roadmap for Lifespan
<BR>
Extension&quot; and one of the things we want to discuss is what genomes
<BR>
should be sequenced next.  Short-lived organisms allow scientists
<BR>
to do experiments and intervention tests more quickly.
<BR>
