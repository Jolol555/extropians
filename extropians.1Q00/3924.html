<P>
I have finally read through most of/browsed the remainder of
<BR>
the technical articles by Mike Darwin (BPI Tech Briefs #002/#4)
<BR>
<P>I agree that the articles are seriously written and for the most
<BR>
part technically accurate (a little dated perhaps).  However the
<BR>
articles fail to comment in any serious way on the issue of what
<BR>
can or cannot be repaired by serious nanotech (which is what Ralph
<BR>
and a number of others argue will inevitably be required to reanimate).
<BR>
<P>As Mike points out in BPI Tech Brief #4, regarding the injuries
<BR>
caused by cerebral ischemia, there are a host of problems that
<BR>
occur when the brain becomes deoxygenated/deglucose-ylated.
<BR>
The complexity of these problems is very large and you are
<BR>
unlikely to have single individuals who can &quot;grok&quot; the entire
<BR>
range of possible damages (and solutions).  Solution: Cryonicists
<BR>
should establish a network of individuals, each of which is *the*
<BR>
expert on the state of the art with regard to various pathologies
<BR>
(calcium influx, free radical damage, mitochondrial swelling,
<BR>
neutrophil activation, ice crystal deformation, etc.).  Only if
<BR>
you have individuals who are expert in these areas who are able to
<BR>
converse regularly will you begin to see progress in pre &amp;
<BR>
post-suspension methods.
<BR>
<P>I'll emphasize this point by observing that Mike's concerns about
<BR>
arachidonic acid and iron might be dealt with by aspirin and
<BR>
desferoxamine respectively.
<BR>
<P>However, the only thing I saw in the entire discussion which
<BR>
raised warning flags for me was the destruction of the lysosomes.
<BR>
While ice crystals may disrupt molecules and their locations, they
<BR>
would tend to retain mirror image structures that allow reconstruction.
<BR>
Everything else discussed (chromosome rearrangements, extracellular
<BR>
matrix changes, mitochondrial swelling, etc.) can be repaired with
<BR>
the exception of damage caused by uncontrolled lysosomal enzymes.
<BR>
<P>Lysosomal enzymes will fundamentally cause information loss.
<BR>
They dismantle proteins and rearrange structure in such a way
<BR>
that it may not be possible to reconstruct the original architecture.
<BR>
To my mind, that implies that the fundamental requirement for
<BR>
cryonic reanimation is not CPR for oxygenation or cryoprotectats
<BR>
for reducing freezing damage, but lowering the temperature of the
<BR>
brain to reduce the activity of lysosomal enzymes and/or adding drugs
<BR>
to completely inhibit them.
<BR>
<P>You have to look at it this way -- If I break your mirror into
<BR>
a zillion &quot;relatively&quot; unique pieces, I will still be able to
<BR>
reassemble your mirror exactly the way it was orginally.  On the
<BR>
other hand if I disassemble your mirror into a zillion &quot;identical&quot;
<BR>
molecules, I will likely never be able to reassemble it the way
<BR>
it was orginally.  I may be able to produce a functional equivalent
<BR>
of what was there originally, but it will not be an original.
<BR>
<P>Of course these approaches beg the issue of exactly what it is
<BR>
that people undergoing cryonic suspension are trying to preserve.
<BR>
That is something, I suspect, is less examined than some might
<BR>
argue would be desirable.
<BR>
<P>John, feel free to repost this to cryonet.
