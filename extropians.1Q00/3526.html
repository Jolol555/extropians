<P><EM>    &gt; the trivial case is simply to say that a &quot;red&quot; sensations is defined to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; represent 700 nm electromagnetic radiation
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm really not trying to be difficult and that definition would be fine for most things
<BR>
but you're trying to use it as part of the foundation for an objective theory
<BR>
of qualia, one good enough for you to know how I experience the world,
<BR>
and it's just not good enough for that, not nearly good enough.  I won't even
<BR>
bother about &quot;representation&quot;, if you want to work at such a fundamental level
<BR>
you'd need a deep understanding of what &quot;is&quot; is.  No chance!
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;computer  representations have numerical 3D information but other than that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;are  not in any related way 3D
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems good enough to me, In what other way do they need to be related?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Are you saying there is something relevant to whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; qualia exist outside of such simple examples of spatial meaning and
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; definitions?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it's different. I can measure space, I can measure the actions of a robot,
<BR>
I can measure your actions, but I can't even detect your qualia much less measure it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; There isn't much complexity at all in what red is like.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know and will never know  if red is complex or not but I do know
<BR>
it's indescribable. Ever word in the dictionary has a definition and every
<BR>
one of those definitions are made of words that are in the same dictionary,
<BR>
but no sequence of those words will allow somebody to understand red
<BR>
who has not already had a direct sensation of it.
