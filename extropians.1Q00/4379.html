<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; To my knowledge not. I'm working on memory transfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hippocampus and cortex, and there is no real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; evidence this can occur -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which makes life much harder for me :-) What seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to happen in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reasearch is that one part of the brain can train
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; another part to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the same function, but this a rather special case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and likely not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; workable everywhere else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oh well.... hmm.  If one part can train another part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do the same function... can this part be forced to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do the training?  If you suppresed one section of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain and had the hardware equivalent for it to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with... and if you did this with each section.... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, the hippocampus seems to be good at storing information
<BR>
quickly, and then train other parts of the brain. The first ability is
<BR>
due to some special properties of the cells and network but could in
<BR>
principle be imitated by giving the cortex high doses of plasticity
<BR>
enhancing stuff like acetylcholine. The second part is the problem -
<BR>
the hippocampus is connected to nearly every part of the cortex, but
<BR>
the cortex doesn't have the same internal connectivity. Also, the
<BR>
replay ability likely hinges on some special properties of the local
<BR>
network, although this is more guesswork. So it doesn't seem you can
<BR>
train another piece of cortex to become a new hippocampus (although
<BR>
some children born with no hippocampus seem to do almost as well using
<BR>
a related part of the cortex, the enthorhinal cortex, but that is
<BR>
likely a special case).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As for uploading, I guess that if you integrate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neural network to your mind, and learn how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; integrate the network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with your thinking, gradually more and more of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would exist within the computing matrix. The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is that &quot;you&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be growing - it would not be that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; memories and everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *moved* to the computer, but rather that new parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; developed inside it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enhancing your abilities. So the old brain would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; still be needed until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough interconnections had emerged to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; irrelevant - but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might not happen for some functions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe at that point &quot;you&quot; would be more inside the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer than out... at which point, copying that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little original bit might be nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minor... since your authentic self was now more inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than outside the computer, so to speak. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. That's the way I would like to do the transition, even if I'm
<BR>
not averse to the &quot;scan and simulate&quot; model either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So I guess it wouldn't be &quot;you&quot; so much as &quot;mostly you&quot;... the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question, I guess, would be how much is enough?
</EM><BR>
<P>How can we tell?
<BR>
