<P>
Amara,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am truly sorry to hear about your problems on the WWW.  It is true that 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
web and internet in general allow us to mask ourselves (if we have the 
<BR>
skills) to a great degree.  I myself have been bitten a few times by such 
<BR>
actions.  I hope that your self-imposed vacation from the web will be a short 
<BR>
one, but I fear that the problems you encountered will still be there when 
<BR>
you return.  How to deal with them?  By and large you'll have to find your 
<BR>
own way.  I try to take reasonable precautions, remember I can always say no, 
<BR>
but take people as genuine until they prove otherwise.  It's not a perfect 
<BR>
method, but I don't expect perfection.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for myself, I would guess that I am pretty much the same online as in 
<BR>
real-life.  But of course, I have always been known to be a little on the 
<BR>
silly and dramatic side in real-life, and on the otherhand have had the great 
<BR>
good luck of being able to write in a way that sounds much like I'm speaking 
<BR>
(or so I am told).  Some of those online here may be able to comment whether 
<BR>
that is true or not.  I hope they will, and that my perception that I'm 
<BR>
pretty much the same online as in the flesh is accurate, and that that gives 
<BR>
you some hope that not everyone you meet in cyberspace is pure illusion.  Of 
<BR>
course, we all have a bit of smoke and mirrors built into our personae&lt;sp?&gt;, 
<BR>
even in real-life&lt;bg&gt;.
<BR>
<P>Take care and good luck,
<BR>
<P>Glen Finney
