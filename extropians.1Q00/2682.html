For example, I might like the whole idea of a cloak, but in daily life it 
<BR>
would make people uneasy, which is not a message I normally wish to send. So 
<BR>
instead I wear my labcoat open so I get that nice flapping in the breeze 
<BR>
effect as I rush to a code, and when I go outside I like to wear a long 
<BR>
blackcoat, again open if it isn't too cold (and if it is, then close it up 
<BR>
to restore full functionality, which in my book trumps appearance). My 
<BR>
personal asthetics remain, but I adapt them for the setting. I imagine I 
<BR>
will do much the same in a bod mod future, and highly recommend the approach 
<BR>
to others.

<P>I have a love of cloaks myself.  As a young boy watching Darth Vader regally 
<BR>
enter the captured rebel ship, I just knew cloaks were where it's at!  Zorro 
<BR>
also grabbed my imagination and I wanted to slash the letter Z everywhere as 
<BR>
a kid.  Also, the red cloak of a Roman Imperial Centaurion is extremely 
<BR>
impressive.  I can't wait to see the new film, &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  Last night I 
<BR>
saw &quot;Tombstone&quot; (a must-see film) and I loved the long black overcoats they 
<BR>
wore.
<BR>
<P>I have thought of getting one of the desperado/country style coats.  They 
<BR>
are popular up here in Alaska.  Anyway, I think it's cool who you have 
<BR>
adapted your love of cloaks to your regular life.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
