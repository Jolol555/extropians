James Swayze wrote regarding nano advances:
<BR>
Provided we keep our current system of government. Can anyone envision a 
<BR>
system capable of keeping up?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>We are really beginning to see a government TRY to dominate utterly a 
<BR>
growing technology.  That government is communist China, in their desire to 
<BR>
not let the net get out of hand among Chinese users.  I have read they are 
<BR>
really tightening their hold now.  It makes me think of Princess Leia saying 
<BR>
to Grand Moff Tarkin that the harder he tightens the imperial grip on the 
<BR>
galaxy, the more systems will slip through his fingers.  But will this 
<BR>
empire win??
<BR>
