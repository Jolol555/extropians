<P>
The evidence for a historical Jesus is amazingly thin and highly suspect.
<BR>
<P>There are no known writings contemporaneous to Jesus that mention him.
<BR>
<P>The earliest known writings mentioning Jesus, by Paul sometime before 60 CE, focus
<BR>
mainly on Christ as a spiritual being offering salvation, and give little regard
<BR>
to a corporeal Jesus who may have existed on earth.
<BR>
<P>The Gospels, which were probably written in the 1st or 2nd century CE, do describe
<BR>
the life of Jesus, but are most likely merely retellings of the popular myths of
<BR>
the day.  Some historians think many of the details of Jesus' life were borrowed
<BR>
from Mithraism, a Pagan religion whose deity Mithra lived a life remarkably
<BR>
similar to that of Jesus (virgin birth, 12 disciples, miracles, death &amp;
<BR>
resurrection, etc.), and that this was basically a marketing ploy to make
<BR>
Christianity more appealing to Pagans and win them over as converts, or to make it
<BR>
more palatable when they were forced to convert during the reign of Constantine.
<BR>
<P>There are a very few non-Christian sources, Jewish and Roman historians, all born
<BR>
after Jesus' purported death, so of course they were writing at least several
<BR>
decades after his death.   Among them are Josephus Flavius, Tacitus, and Pliny the
<BR>
Younger.  For the most part, Jesus is mentioned only very briefly, almost in
<BR>
passing.  Some of these writings are believed to be Christian forgeries; as for
<BR>
the rest, the authors were likely just passing on stories as told to them by
<BR>
Christian believers.  At any rate, these writings were held by the Church for
<BR>
centuries, and one early Church leader, Eusebius, openly advocated the use of lies
<BR>
and deception to further the interests of the Church.  Some scholars think he
<BR>
authored the forgeries.

<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Sorry you missed it, but the new millennium began in 1996, 2,000 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; *actual* birth of Jesus Christ.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Actually, no one knows the date of Jesus's birth. Estimates run about 3-4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  years before and after the year 0. The date of our current celebrations was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  a convention adopted later on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there any actual historical evidence that JC even existed?
