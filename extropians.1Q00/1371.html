<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  No doubt, but we have little control over people's attitudes as a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  public policy.  Yes, the HK gov't has tried for years to convince people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that keeping the city clean would be better for everyone, but...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This may be because those exhortations &quot;fall on deaf ears&quot; in the sense that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they don't call on basic values and memes in the majority culture.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what I mean, it's not enough to try to change people's attitudes to deal
<BR>
with the problem -- actual regulatory action is needed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Also, I doubt that expectations of civic behavior significantly deter the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  really serious polluters (big oil companies?) when profits are at stake.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I think they do, but not in the way one might think.  At a minimum,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such expectations cause the &quot;serious polluters&quot; to whom you refer to do so as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surreptitiously as possible, and to clothe their activity in &quot;propaganda&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that calls on the mainstream culture's expectations of civic behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're probably right to some degree, but this alone seems not to be enough to
<BR>
stop or reverse the process of environmental degradation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The activities of polluters in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultures that have a different conception of civic behavior aren't so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constrained.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder how much difference culture really makes in this, though, seems like the
<BR>
West and Japan were just as polluted as HK and China are now at earlier stages in
<BR>
their respective development processes.  Is there really any way to show a
<BR>
cultural difference?
<BR>
<P>The biggest difference I can see is because of greater gov't regulation.
<BR>
Singapore is much less polluted than HK, it's more like living in a park than a
<BR>
city, seemingly because it is a dictatorship and the gov't decreed that was how
<BR>
it would be.  (Of course there are other factors, lesser population density and
<BR>
so on, but still the difference is striking.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; FYI, my thinking along these lines is influenced by the recent work of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Francis Fukuyama, especially his most recent book, &quot;Trust&quot;, which I highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recommend.
</EM><BR>
<P>I read that when it first came out and I agree with your recommendation, a very
<BR>
thought-provoking book.  Japan and Hong Kong, the two places I have lived for the
<BR>
last ten years, are on opposite ends of the spectrum in this regard.  Huge
<BR>
amounts of time and resources are wasted in HK because no one trusts anyone else,
<BR>
so everything must be checked and double-checked to make sure that no one is
<BR>
being cheated.  It verges on clinical paranoia sometimes, I think...but in fact
<BR>
someone IS always out to get you here, as I've found out time and again...
