<EM>&gt; Extropians,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         The first big clue that Bill Joy is way off in his wired
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article comes with his comment early on:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tiny elite - just as it is today&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I don't know how he came up with this but to me nothing could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be further from the truth.  If there is one thing today's heigh tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet world is making blatantly obvious, it is that religions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries, companies and any group controlled by a central &quot;tiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elite&quot; are doomed to never again wield the power they once had over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the masses.  In this day where almost every citizen has a large and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rapidly growing stock portfolio, and the ability to purchase huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amounts of computing power, every individual is going to have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to do and get almost anything they want, completely ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any central government elite or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have to disagree. At the current time, corporations and other
<BR>
large &quot;elite&quot; groups can wield far more computing power than you can
<BR>
possibly buy. Even if you get all your friends together ala SETI. IBM
<BR>
is going to have a petaflop computer in just a few years. All cheaper
<BR>
computer chips mean is that the corporations can still buy many more
<BR>
of them than you. I will admit that the Internet is quite an empowering
<BR>
invention for the individual, buts lets face it that big money still
<BR>
matters.
<BR>
<P>P.S. I realize I am not rebutting exactly what you posted, but you on
<BR>
the other hand were not rebutting exactly what Joy said.
