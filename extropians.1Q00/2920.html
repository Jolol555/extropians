<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;philanthropists and scientists to use the site and provide the

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;non-profit&quot; legal status needed for tax purposes, etc.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A friend of mine recently made a suggestion to me that we might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consider going 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into this buisiness (although he was thinking that it should support as many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;charities as possible, suitably categorized). What do folks think of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viability of this idea?
</EM><BR>
<P>Regarding the charity clearinghouse concept, I spent quite a bit of
<BR>
time dreaming up ways to handle this - my thinking was more oriented
<BR>
toward providing a, uh, less consumptive approach to the holiday
<BR>
gift giving frenzy (after returning from Third World travel 2 days before
<BR>
Christmas and feeling obligated to hit the malls so as to not offend
<BR>
anyone I got to thinking..).   After the holidays passed I lost
<BR>
interest and did nothing on the subject for a year, then this past
<BR>
year I started looking into it again.   There are now many websites
<BR>
that offer lists of charities to donate to and handle the donation
<BR>
process in some way or another. - there was one in particular which
<BR>
was professionally-executed to the point that it convinced me to drop my
<BR>
own efforts, oddly, I can't seem to find evidence of it on the web anymore!
<BR>
<P>I wanted to include a few other things that these sites don't seem to 
<BR>
(specifically, political donations, and Amazon-style
<BR>
wishlists), but the problem looked solved enough that it didn't seem worth
<BR>
my while to pile in.  (I'm happy to talk about this off the list if
<BR>
anyone's interested)
<BR>
<P>The &quot;underfunded science&quot; notion is interesting, but a couple of things
<BR>
jump out at me.  It's been a while since I've been close to the
<BR>
grant-grubbing process, but don't most universities try hard nowadays
<BR>
to control &gt;applications&lt; of their research?  I guess it just bugs
<BR>
my capitalist sensibilities to think about contributing philanthropically
<BR>
to something that someone else is going to take advantage of and profit
<BR>
from..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(3) An philanthropic incubator or venture fund.  This is perhaps the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;most novel idea.  People will not be giving away their money, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will be making an investment in a good thing that might or might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pay off.  The problem with this is that you may have to focus more on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;profits in some cases than you'd like.  The benefit is a potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;huge endowment through the IPOs of some of the ventures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the idea that I have been leaning towards. I'm just enough of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarian that I think that most charities could be better replaced by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions that make investments in the infrastructures that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charities merely prop up. In a similar manner, if I'm going to give money to strangers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would like to think that there *might* be a profit in it somewhere. Still, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all know how being profit centered can stifle innovation, so I curious to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see if anyone on this list have any ideas on how to provide scientists the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to fail, while being able to capitalize on any successes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been trying to dredge up relevant history, but wasn't this sort of
<BR>
the idea behind Genentech?  A sort of marriage between researchers and
<BR>
venture capital around trying to profit from research in a specific
<BR>
domain (recombinant DNA tech in this case) ?
<BR>
<P>/rs
<BR>
(ps: obligatory delurk - I've been reading off and on, mostly on, for
<BR>
around a year.. thanks for lots of neat stuff)
