<EM>&gt; Look at this one guy who employs a handful of people and has

<EM>&gt; his own supercomputer. He's beating the pants off of the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in decoding the genome, and because the government hates being on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the losing end, is now trying to socialize his results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Point A:  He is not beating the pants of &quot;the government&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is not the government, but a mixture of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government, philanthropic, and pharmaceutical money.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, &quot;The government&quot; have gotten about as far as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venter, arguably further, as PE Corp has a bunch of fragments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which they _may_ assemble first, no one knows.
<BR>
<P>Point B: In my humble opinion Venter is being granted ownership  to
<BR>
information which is not for sale. I own it already. And so do you. I am not
<BR>
selling. Therefore I do not want the government (who is trying via their
<BR>
patent officers) to steal my ownership rights and give them to Craig Venter.
<BR>
<P>He is not patenting innovative medicine, or proteomic interventions, or even
<BR>
_functional_ variants on the genome.
<BR>
<P>Instead, he has filed patents on thousands of _fragments_ of code. Raw code.
<BR>
<P>He hopes thereby to gain control of all of the above genuine innovations by
<BR>
gaining monopoly ownership of human genetic variation simply on the basis
<BR>
that PE Corp was the first (or often second) to read fragments of these
<BR>
sequences. Simply to break the code into chunks and record the symbols in
<BR>
these chunks. That is the claim-base.
<BR>
<P>I think this claim is nonsensical. If granted, it would retard genomic
<BR>
investigation by decades.

[Stallman] declares he would prefer to use a free software program even if
<BR>
it wasn't the best solution for his needs. Freedom, for Stallman, is a
<BR>
fundamental moral good -- the freedom for computer users to share and
<BR>
cooperate, to copy and change code as they please.
