I have the same impression.  I have discovered that the more I learn, the 
<BR>
more exciting just standing at a bus stop becomes - what was once just empty 
<BR>
time is suddenly an opportunity to play with ideas, build stories and study 
<BR>
the surroundings.
<BR>
<P>I have also noted that the more I learn, the more I want to learn and 
<BR>
experience. This causes a problem: I still only have 24 hours in a day and 
<BR>
there are much more stuff I could do that I can do. Hence I constantly have 
<BR>
to make choices about it, but for every exciting think I postpone I know I 
<BR>
can nearly always return to it and do it someday. If I live to 37,000 I will 
<BR>
likely have the time for most of the stuff I currently have postponed, but 
<BR>
will now have an even greater number of future excitement to long for.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>This must be a wonderful state of being to possess.  You have trained your 
<BR>
mind to be keenly observe and also act as a stage for stories and a forum 
<BR>
for ideas.
<BR>
<P>For especially you, greatly extended lifespan
<BR>
And cybernetic enhancement would allow your many ideas to be made real, and 
<BR>
in much shorter time then now.  I may need to be enhanced just to keep up 
<BR>
with your output!
<BR>
<P>I liked how described the excitement of discovery, even when at a bus stop.  
<BR>
I find it so cool that you actually ride the bus!  In the United States, 
<BR>
mass transit is often looked down upon as a means of transportation for 
<BR>
people, especially by professionals.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
