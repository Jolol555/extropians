<EM>&gt; There's also the question of whether the indiginous population would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; welcome the reinstatement of imperialist external rule.  Most of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries worked hard to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Economically many countries are worse off, but it would be a terrible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blow to their pride to ask for the hated rulers to come back in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start running things again.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have an apartment house that you aren't managing well, you can hire a
<BR>
management company to do it for you.  There are cities that contract out
<BR>
ambulance services, garbage collection, and even fire fighting services, in
<BR>
order to save money.  Why not contract out the entire government to a large
<BR>
corporation who could manage the country professionally?
<BR>
<P>If this idea caught on, then corporations would have to compete against each
<BR>
other to win bids.  If countries adopted this idea, government would be reduced
<BR>
to the boring task of keeping the streets clean, and making the trains run on
<BR>
time.
