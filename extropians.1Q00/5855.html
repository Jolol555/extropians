<P>
Well, the discussion has gone on for a week now and in reviewing
<BR>
the ideas, there has been no mention of &quot;present value analysis&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The question is:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What bold endeavors do you wish you could see funded in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next decade?&quot;
<BR>
In providing suggestions, we should look at whether we giving
<BR>
answers (we personally) think are &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;clever&quot; ideas, or are
<BR>
we providing proposals, that are really &quot;bold endeavors&quot;, i.e.
<BR>
ideas for things that would truly make a difference?
<BR>
<P>First, you have to look at (a) what might *really* be done (there
<BR>
is no point to undertaking an endeavor if it *really* cannot be done),
<BR>
and (b) what isn't already being done (because the stuff currently
<BR>
being done presumably isn't very &quot;bold&quot;).  Then finally, you have to
<BR>
try to determine the present value of the various suggestions.
<BR>
<P>When I do this analysis, I am forced to conclude that Natasha Vita-More
<BR>
is absolutely correct.  The boldest endeavors of the greatest value
<BR>
would push issues of lifespan extension and technology for that
<BR>
into the daily discussions of every person on the planet.
<BR>
It was pointed out by the people of the Hunger Project, many
<BR>
years ago, that the deaths from hunger and malnutrition occuring
<BR>
in the world were equivalent to crashing a 747 loaded with people
<BR>
into the side of a mountain *every hour*.  Those deaths are
<BR>
a small fraction of the deaths caused by pandemic dieases
<BR>
and aging.
<BR>
<P>While NIH is receiving regular boosts in funding and organizations
<BR>
like the Welcome Trust have their pockets open.  There is much
<BR>
more that could be done.  Fortune (March 27, 2000, pg 226), points
<BR>
out that of the ~$35 Billion in VC that was invested in 1999,
<BR>
the rankings related to health were: Health-care services(8th),
<BR>
Medical devices (10th), Biotechnology(11th), and Pharmaceuticals
<BR>
(17th; last).  Pharmaceuticals received less money in 1999 than
<BR>
it did in 1997.  All of the health categories *combined* got less
<BR>
funding than any of the top 5 catagories.
<BR>
<P>The greatest aggregate loss to the planet is millions of people
<BR>
dying every year.  We may be losing species at a rapid rate
<BR>
but we are losing humans as well.  And push come to shove
<BR>
I'll take the life of a human over the life of a bug in the
<BR>
Amazon every day of the week.  The longer it takes for people
<BR>
to get serious about re-engineering people so they do not age
<BR>
and die, the more deaths there will be on the hands of those who
<BR>
could have done something but didn't.  In ten or twenty years
<BR>
the people who had the resources or the opportunity, will look
<BR>
back and wonder how many more they could have saved if they had
<BR>
pushed a bit harder or invested a little sooner.
<BR>
<P>The boldest endeavor, that I can think of would be to commute
<BR>
the death sentences imposed on the majority of people alive today.
<BR>
Saving the greatest number of humans that can possibly be saved
<BR>
should be the priority.  I don't believe that projects that
<BR>
change governments or provide free education or put terminals
<BR>
in the hands of everyone on the planet will do that as effectively
<BR>
as developing the medical, bio- and nano-technlogies that are
<BR>
required to eliminate current causes of death and aging.
<BR>
<P>Robert
