<P>I suppose you are referring to Angela Tilby, the theologian, whose main
<BR>
concern with extending life was that people might become less religious if
<BR>
they didn't have to face death. - Oh shit, hadn't thought of that...
<BR>
<P>And then there was George Monbiot, environmentalist campaigner and champion
<BR>
of the anti-GM food movement. He is a charismatic figure and appears on
<BR>
television very frequently. He was worried about life-extension resulting in
<BR>
the creation of a new class of &quot;time-lords&quot;. His view is that there is a
<BR>
finite sum of stuff, and that if we live longer we will use up even more of
<BR>
that stuff, thus exploiting the poor even more than we do now. He also said
<BR>
that life expectancy is increasing fastest in the developed countries (which
<BR>
is false, but I could not get in to refute that). The best answer to all
<BR>
this would have been Garret Smyth's reaction when I talked to him on the
<BR>
phone after the show: &quot;If I go home and shoot myself tonight, how the hell
<BR>
will that help the farmer in Peru?&quot; I tried a more charitable approach and
<BR>
suggested that underlying his objection might be a concern about
<BR>
overpopulation and then I went on to explain that fertility rates are often
<BR>
below the replacement rate in technologically advanced countries and that we
<BR>
should try to spread the benefits of technology, education and women's
<BR>
rights to countries that are currently poor. (I was tempted to throw in &quot;And
<BR>
let's grow some more GM-food!&quot; but luckily managed to restrain myself.)
