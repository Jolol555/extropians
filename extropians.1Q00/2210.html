<BR>
<P>Sunday, 06 February 2000
<BR>
<P>Anders,
<BR>
<P>Unless you object, I shall cross-post to World-Making mailing list,
<BR>
which covers constructing role-playing settings. Its web page lies at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.phoenyx.net">http://www.phoenyx.net</A>. 
<BR>
<P>In this post, I'll discuss US Navy status, limits, ongoing
<BR>
modernization and its problems, future systems, and general
<BR>
speculation on America's military. Next, I'll mention a few ideas
<BR>
particular to your setting, and then close with some gaming tips.
<BR>
<P>America currently enjoys naval supremacy. Its submarine and surface
<BR>
fleets dominate the waves. It possesses more and more capable aircraft
<BR>
carriers than any other nation. Every American combatant vessel
<BR>
(except attack submarines) can carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. Few
<BR>
other nations can compete in any department. Non-American carriers
<BR>
rely on V/STOL aircraft. Only Great Britain has submarine-launched
<BR>
Tomahawks, and only on a single vessel. Japan's SDF has one
<BR>
AEGIS-class cruiser. Former Soviet Union (FSU) nations have weapon
<BR>
systems with performance comparable to American killingry. These tend
<BR>
to have larger sizes, fewer numbers, and lower reliability.
<BR>
<P>America's navy faces four main limits: retaining qualified personnel,
<BR>
dispersion, its on-going shift from the open ocean to the littorals,
<BR>
and its fragile endurance. About 67%-80% of Sailors, both commissioned
<BR>
and enlisted, leave service after their first term. Part of this comes
<BR>
from higher pay in private-sector jobs. Some of the rest comes from
<BR>
job-related stress such as long frequent overseas deployment. These
<BR>
deployments place American military forces &quot;in harm's way&quot; in three
<BR>
main places: Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, and drug interdiction
<BR>
operations. These new areas of interest demand a change from the Cold
<BR>
War focus of blue-water operations and anti-submarine warfare against
<BR>
a Soviet fleet to a new set of abilities to act against the coastlines
<BR>
of Earth. New and extended responsibilities also stretch ship's
<BR>
endurance. America's surface fleet (excepting carriers) runs from gas
<BR>
turbine engines. This combines with a policy of maintaining a reserve
<BR>
fuel capacity of 50% to make at-sea resupply very important.
<BR>
Unfortunately, America has few oilers left. These are special-purpose
<BR>
supply ships designed to restock other vessels.
<BR>
<P>Modernization and upgrades do go on in US Navy. Many newer vessels
<BR>
have &quot;Smart Ship&quot; upgrades, which potentially automates navigation and
<BR>
helm control. This upgrade doesn't require dry-dock time, but sees
<BR>
little use because of institutional conservatism. Such resistance
<BR>
evaporates before more serious challenges. Even older vessels have
<BR>
sensors to detect biological or chemical agents. Unfortunately, these
<BR>
have little practical use because they rely on air sampling.
<BR>
Laser-based spectrography promises detection at range, but isn't yet
<BR>
in service. Sonar improvements happen continuously. Sonar is a classic
<BR>
&quot;hard problem,&quot; and the military solution is throwing more computers
<BR>
at it. The overwhelming majority of computer power aboard a combatant
<BR>
is devoted to sonar, but sonar remains unreliable. Submarines remain
<BR>
nigh-undetectable. Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) now in
<BR>
development might soon augment cruisers' and destroyers' helicopter
<BR>
assets with small, high-endurance sensor platforms. Naval aviation
<BR>
recently received the F-18E/F. This aircraft is an evolutionary
<BR>
improvement over current carrier-based fighters, but its adoption owes
<BR>
more to political maneuvering than military need. At best, it serves
<BR>
as an interim measure to tide the Navy over until the Joint Strike
<BR>
Fighter (JSF) enters service. The most significant recent improvement
<BR>
in C4I (command, control, computers, communication and intelligence)
<BR>
comes from the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; system. This is a new method of handling
<BR>
shore bombardment. It manages available assets to allow the best
<BR>
possible response to calls for fire support from land units by
<BR>
treating all weapon platforms in theater as both sensors and effectors
<BR>
in a network. This allows the most appropriate munition from the most
<BR>
available source to be the most likely response to calls for combat
<BR>
support. This might be an anti-radiation missile, a sea-launched
<BR>
cruise missile, or a shell from a ship's gun. Recent improvements to
<BR>
naval guns allow ranges above sixty nautical miles. Combined with
<BR>
GPS-guidance in both the fire control system and in the projectiles
<BR>
themselves, naval guns now assume most characteristics of &quot;precision
<BR>
weapons.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Naval modernization is obstructed most by conservative navy culture.
<BR>
The controversy over nuclear power is a good historic example. The
<BR>
resistance to computer navigation is another. One in early stages is
<BR>
the role of humans in combat aircraft. Conventional wisdom suggests
<BR>
the F-22 will be the last generation of manned fighter, and the later
<BR>
JSF models might be the first unmanned warplanes. Another budding
<BR>
controversy covers the future of aircraft carriers. The enormous
<BR>
expense and vulnerability of a floating airport and its escort vessels
<BR>
is currently a taboo subject. Eventually, carriers will go the way of
<BR>
the battleship, but no one knows how soon. The proposed replacement,
<BR>
the Arsenal Ship, received no support in America's last military
<BR>
review. It lost out to a next-generation carrier, a next-generation
<BR>
destroyer and new marine assault vessels. Resisting innovation comes
<BR>
not only from Navy culture, but also from legitimate concern over the
<BR>
enormous cost and ever-shorter lifespans of military systems. A proven
<BR>
alternative is always preferred. This has the obvious advantage of a
<BR>
performance history and interoperability with less advanced
<BR>
militaries. (I.e., every other nation on the planet.)
<BR>
<P>Future improvements in naval prowess range from the certain to the
<BR>
likely to the possible. Using lasers for detecting and communicating
<BR>
with submarines from ships, planes and satellites is a current
<BR>
research focus, but results are classified. Another area of interest
<BR>
is underwater cannon. These differ from, but might have performance
<BR>
similar to, the solid-rocket motor torpedoes of Soviet-era design.
<BR>
America's navy continues to use dolphins in many of the same
<BR>
capacities as dogs are used above. Little of this work reaches open
<BR>
literature, so invent freely. Next-generation close-in defense will
<BR>
probably go from current high-speed 20mm guns (Phalanx and Goalkeeper)
<BR>
and quick-response missile launchers (RAM) to laser weapons. Automated
<BR>
warplanes saw mention above. Hypersonic munitions currently receive
<BR>
much interest because great speed could reduce the ability of an enemy
<BR>
to detect, analyze and respond to threat. They could also reduce the
<BR>
need for explosive payload through kinetic kill. Both missiles and
<BR>
shells are now under development. I don't know much about naval
<BR>
applications of stealth techniques, but I strongly suspect stealthy
<BR>
cruise missiles are now black budget items. Science-fiction favorites
<BR>
like orbital bombardment platforms, MHD propulsion, electromagnetic
<BR>
acceleration weapons all now seem unlikely. Deploying dedicated
<BR>
orbital artillery is an overtly hostile act. America enjoys space
<BR>
superiority, but has no public plans to even study such a system. I
<BR>
have heard rumors that MHD propulsion is not as stealthy as popularly
<BR>
believed. This removes most of the reason for its military adoption.
<BR>
Mass drivers and railguns seem to offer no improvement over current
<BR>
guns, although variants are under consideration for replacing steam
<BR>
catapults on the next generation of carriers.
<BR>
<P>In general, America's military prowess has the following strengths and
<BR>
weaknesses. They enjoy superiority in space, sensors, and information
<BR>
warfare. Dominating space comes about through lack of real
<BR>
competition. Put simply, Russia's broke, China's way behind, and no
<BR>
one talks much about anti-satellite weapons. Sensor superiority
<BR>
follows from space superiority. This might change in the next few
<BR>
years as private remote sensing companies become more common and more
<BR>
competent. Though America's government would like to exercise &quot;shutter
<BR>
control,&quot; this seems no more reasonable than their silly encryption
<BR>
policy. However, watch for quiet agreements between Department of
<BR>
Defense and private companies for fat contracts and relaxed shutter
<BR>
control in return for agreements to not develop capabilities in
<BR>
certain parts of the spectrum, such as radar sensing.  Micro-UAVs,
<BR>
some massing less than a kilogram, now exist as remote sensor drones
<BR>
for individual soldiers. None have been adopted yet. Information
<BR>
warfare ability, especially offensive IW is now highly classified. In
<BR>
recent Air Force wargames, participants are simply told to assume
<BR>
certain results without knowing when, why, or how these work.
<BR>
America's military suffers from extremely poor retention of service
<BR>
members as discussed above. (I personally knew service members on food
<BR>
stamps. Senator McCain doesn't exaggerate.) Electronics warfare
<BR>
capacity has degenerated since the Cold War's end, but this is
<BR>
currently improving. Fortunately, it is also subject to software
<BR>
upgrades and can expect to merge with IW over the years. Logistics has
<BR>
yet to fully adopt many commercial practices brought allowed by
<BR>
improving computer networks. This area offers comparatively easy
<BR>
improvements. Transporting troops and materiel remains very difficult.
<BR>
Many proposals for improving this situation exist. Some rely on more
<BR>
and better versions of current methods, such as the new marine assault
<BR>
ship. Others rely on more exotic technology, like
<BR>
wing-in-ground-effect vessels or high-speed semi-rigid aircraft. Far
<BR>
down the road exist hypersonic transports as variants of SSTO vehicles
<BR>
or submarine supply dumps.
<BR>
<P><P>Here are a few setting-specific suggestions and questions. First,
<BR>
since glaciation occurred, icebreakers probably exist in most navies.
<BR>
Some countries, especially those in areas near newly exposed land
<BR>
masses, have stronger amphibious troops. Since climate change is so
<BR>
important, you can expect meteorology to be much improved over current
<BR>
standards. This becomes a military advantage to those forces with
<BR>
better prediction. Some groups might work hard to alter the weather in
<BR>
their favor. This might include submarine deflection of ocean
<BR>
currents, though I can't imagine how you'd alter the major ones. Maybe
<BR>
opening up a volcanic vent? If you have it available, I'd like to see
<BR>
a timeline. Does the USA concentrate its attention on internal
<BR>
matters? If not, they might still focus on Western Hemisphere affairs.
<BR>
The ongoing intervention in Colombia's civil war is a good example.
<BR>
<P>Finally, please use GURPS. ;-) Seriously, their vehicle and robot
<BR>
construction rules can offer surprising insights into hardware and
<BR>
also provide the ridiculously detailed statistics beloved by military
<BR>
nuts worldwide. For example, I designed an AI for the Reign of Steel
<BR>
setting. The setting required space-proofing the machine. To my
<BR>
amazement the device not only would survive running on Luna's surface
<BR>
for two weeks, but it would also float.	I don't know if you have any
<BR>
familiarity with the game FUDGE, but it provides a set of Interactive
<BR>
History rules. This might prove helpful in providing a large-scale
<BR>
background in your setting.
