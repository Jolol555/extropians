<P>
<EM>&gt; Every act, every conversation (heck every thought, if possible) 
</EM><BR>
digitally
<BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded forever and accessible to everyone.  Based upon a lifetime's 
</EM><BR>
worth
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of such data it would probably a fairly easy matter to determine who 
</EM><BR>
could
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and could not be trusted to have their very own near-anything-box 
</EM><BR>
(&quot;NAB&quot;).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If we can come up with a reliable Halperinesque truth machine, our 
</EM><BR>
fears
<BR>
<EM>&gt; about our neighbors having NAB's could be eliminated.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So what do you think, would you be willing to give up all privacy in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exchange for the privilege of having access to a NAB?  Would such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparent society necessarily resolve our nano-related security 
</EM><BR>
concerns?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- B. Lightyear
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the problem I see with this transparent society is that, a very 
<BR>
radical revolution, on civil liberties, democracy and respect and 
<BR>
tolerance for other people's lifestyles is required, for this to 
<BR>
function, otherwise
<BR>
jobs may be denied to you for your juvenile mistakes for example, or 
<BR>
you could be prosecuted, because you
<BR>
did something that even though is not wrong, it was declared ilegal by 
<BR>
your government (like experimenting with psychoactive substances)
<BR>
<P>However, I suppose that once we know all the single details about any 
<BR>
desired person, our cultural values will radically change, the myth of 
<BR>
perfection will be more than destroyed, after all, our politicians, 
<BR>
priests, policemen, etc are humans too, so this kind of technologies 
<BR>
could be the tool that boosts further the advancement of our 
<BR>
societies, to a more tolerant and less coercive ones, so I suppose a 
<BR>
transparent society is the utopia both the anarchists and the 
<BR>
bigbrother advocates.
