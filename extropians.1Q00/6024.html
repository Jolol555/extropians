<EM>&gt; Dieting does not work, you've got to eat to lose weight, but what,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when, and especially how much is the trick . I checked out the site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mentioned, yeah alot of it has to do with genetics. We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; endomorphs create more fat cells and are better at filling them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but until the gene engineers come along and fix that we're on our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The trick is to stop waiting for a magic pill and get down to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard work.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not talking about belly aching, I am talking about doing solid research.
<BR>
Probably the right diet would help.  The question is what is the right diet?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Check out Roy Walfords books on eating for nutrient density
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regardless of calorie restriction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am following a low carb diet, which basically eliminates empty calorie foods.
<BR>
This is probably similar to nutrient dense diets, since non-nutrient rich foods
<BR>
are verboten in both diets. The doctors that originated it, have a theory of why
<BR>
it works, and they have had success with thousands of patients.  You would think
<BR>
that if there was a doctor with a diet that reduces a large number of common
<BR>
conditions and preserves lean body mass, that they would be able to get money
<BR>
for research.  But they don't.  The amount of money that is being spent on
<BR>
research, to answer these basic questions, is less than $1 per obese person.
<BR>
<P>Another thing we haven't bothered to spend money on is proving the existence of
<BR>
the HIV virus.  And if it exists, does HIV really cause AIDS?
