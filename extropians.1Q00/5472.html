Stirling Westrop:
<BR>
Yeah. Choosing a strategy for survival is tough. All I can think of to do is 
<BR>
to study as many relevant fields of knowledge as I can, so that I will at 
<BR>
least be well informed of my options at each point along the way.- --
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I remember the post Mike Darwin put here awhile back.  He talked about how 
<BR>
we love to talk about all the different matters that interest us but when 
<BR>
mortality comes knocking at our individual door we are scared silly.  Then 
<BR>
it is not about the 'end of the world' but 'the end of us.'
<BR>
<P>So if as individuals we want to make it we should be focusing alot more on 
<BR>
relevant fields like life-extension (basic and advanced) and also cryonics 
<BR>
because not everyone here is young enough to be sure of gaining enough 
<BR>
'extended lifespan' to fend off death indefinitely.
<BR>
<P>Are we eating right and getting enough exercise?  Are we having routine 
<BR>
physicals?  Do we all have life insurance policies in place so we can at 
<BR>
least get a cryonics policy should we want one later on?  Sudden chronic 
<BR>
illness can make getting life insurance go from 'no problem' to 'permanently 
<BR>
out of luck.'  These are very basic things that matter alot.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
