<P>Wrong Testament.  It was Balaam, the old testament prophet who had
<BR>
intercourse, oral..er..verbal, with his ass, his OWN ass no less.
<BR>
<P>Come to think of it, Bible prophets, judges and sundry characters had a
<BR>
number of bizarre bestial encounters.  Eve and the loquacious serpent.  The
<BR>
leviathan that saved Jonah from drowning, and *hurling* him onto the beach.
<BR>
Hmmm, doesn't that mean Jonah was occult?  Samson (I never took no steroids)
<BR>
killed 1000 bad guys all by himself, using the jawbone of an ass.  Samson
<BR>
tied flaming torches to the tails of a bunch of foxes, in order to destroy
<BR>
his enemies crops.  Samson killed a lion with his bare hands, then, later
<BR>
ate honey out of its' rotting carcass.  Elijah or  ..sha, I can't remember
<BR>
which, righteously caused a bear to attack and kill a bunch of children who
<BR>
teased him by calling him old baldy.  Nice guy.   Elisha or ...ja, I can't
<BR>
remember which, was fed by ravens during a famine.  Everybody tried to
<BR>
appease God by killing and barbequing their livestock.  Jesus sent demons
<BR>
into a large herd of pigs, that proceeded to turn into lemmings, drowning
<BR>
themselves in the nearby lake.  The pig farmer's insurers invented the *Act
<BR>
of God* excuse.  Noah managed to save at least 200 million creatures from
<BR>
drowning, in a hand made boat.
<BR>
<P>The Paul Saul story does have SPaul getting thrown from his startled steed.
<BR>
There are two differing accounts of what happened.  Yup, that's right.  One
<BR>
reports that PSaul's men heard, but didn't see the apparition.  The other
<BR>
account has them seeing, but not hearing whatever caused the commotion.  I
<BR>
know I'm being picky.  Maybe little flaws shouldn't count.  After all, the
<BR>
authors were only human.
<BR>
<P>I should get off my lazy ass and look up the Biblical references for the
<BR>
above, but I don't find any pleasure or benefit or redeeming quality in time
<BR>
spent in a place that consumed too much of me, already.

<EM>&gt;  ass and looked it up.  [I don't know what Im gonna do with that

<EM>&gt;  lazy ass of mine.  I may trade him for a horse.]

</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well....take historical precident as an example...
<BR>
<P>Paul (Saul of Taursaus) fell off his lazy ass (or was thrown....?)...
<BR>
<P>he then had (a) a divine revelation (b) hallucinations caused by (1) trauma
<BR>
(2) the dope he was smoking (3) the alchol he was drinking (4) some
<BR>
combination of the above
<BR>
<P>and the lazy ass spoke to him....
<BR>
<P>Thence he became a supporter of that which he had previously tried to
<BR>
destroy....the major supporter in fact....the MOST infuluential supporter...
<BR>
<P>In fact....if it wasn't for that lazy ass we wouldn't have Christianity
<BR>
today...
<BR>
<P>So don't discount the earth shattering, world changing power of lazy
<BR>
asses...
