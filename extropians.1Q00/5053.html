|&gt; Many humans define as Nazi Germany ``right'' on their traditional left-right
<BR>
|&gt; politicometers.  I don't find national socialists very extropic, though.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|The idea of saying a socialist belongs on the right hand end of any
<BR>
|scale is incomprehensible to me. Shows the sort of newspeak that some
<BR>
|people will go to to avoid guilt by association.
<BR>
<P>Well.. Adolf Hitler actually felt that national socialism (maybe more known as
<BR>
nazism) was &quot;marxism done right&quot;, and among his plans for things to do after
<BR>
he had won the war (WWII) was to &quot;nationalize&quot; all companies, since the State
<BR>
ownership was the correct procedure. He said these things during his talk with
<BR>
his closer associates in the Wolfschanze during WWII. The difference between
<BR>
``socialism'' (as in China, North Korea, SSSR and the other Warsaw pact states)
<BR>
and ``nazism'' (aka national socialism) are mostly irrelevant, IMO.
