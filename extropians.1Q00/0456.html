<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It tooks some time for me to understand the situation in Chechniya
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because we really don't understand Russian history very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you actually understand what's going on in Chechnia, I'd love
<BR>
to have it explained to me. Or rather, can anybody recommend any
<BR>
pointers on where to read up on this &quot;conflict&quot;?
<BR>
<P>All I know about that situation I got from the popular press--which
<BR>
means I effectively know zilch.
<BR>
<P>It all started with the Russian army moving into Dagestan to quell
<BR>
some independence movement there. Then the Russians crossed the
<BR>
border into neighboring Chechnia, supposedly only to hunt down
<BR>
Dagestan rebels who had fled there. Somehow this changed into a
<BR>
mop-up of all of Chechnia, and now we have another siege of Grosny.
<BR>
Dagestan is entirely forgotten.
<BR>
<P>I don't even know *who* the Russian army is fighting. &quot;Terrorists&quot;?
<BR>
Obviously some kind of guerillas. I mean, this is the Russian army.
<BR>
Who are those people that manage to put up what seems to amount to
<BR>
fairly effective resistance? And what keeps the Russians from
<BR>
crushing them? Lack of money? Commanders' incompetence? Political
<BR>
considerations? I can't believe that the Russian army is incapable
<BR>
of putting an end to this quickly.
<BR>
<P>Now, desperately trying to turn this back into a marginally extropian
<BR>
issue:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However the situation in Chechniya and the recent articles on micro-states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do point out some very interesting problems we will be facing.
</EM><BR>
<P>And where can I get information on what's going on in such situations?
<BR>
Waiting ten years and reading the history books will probably lead
<BR>
to the best quality information, but obviously this approach isn't
<BR>
always applicable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Will the only solution be for the pro-technology people to move to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a specific location and declare independence?  If so, how does one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplish this.
</EM><BR>
<P>The same way it's always worked in history:
<BR>
<P>Grab land.
<BR>
Declare independence.
<BR>
Fight bloody war for independence.
<BR>
Win.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
