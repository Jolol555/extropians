<P><P><P><P><P>Holes in one
<BR>
<P><P><P>Despite their fearsome reputation, not all black holes are cosmos-gobbling
<BR>
monsters, says Marcus Chown. There could even be one inside you
<BR>
<P><P>CAUGHT in a high-tech trap, a lone atom is blinking. From the spectrum of its
<BR>
light it looks like a cadmium atom. But to the scientists who have trapped
<BR>
it, there's something not quite right: the frequency is shifted by a puzzling
<BR>
0·002 per cent. Their unease gives way to astonishment as they discover that
<BR>
their captive is a billion billion times heavier than an ordinary atom.
<BR>
Staring them in the face is a freak of nature--for in place of a nucleus,
<BR>
this atom has a gaping hole. A black hole.
<BR>
<P>According to Victor Flambaum and Julian Berengut of the University of New
<BR>
South Wales in Sydney, black hole atoms such as this are a real possibility.
<BR>
In a paper submitted to Physical Review A, the two physicists have calculated
<BR>
the bizarre properties of these objects. Black hole atoms could be part of
<BR>
the dark matter that binds the Galaxy, they might accelerate nuclear
<BR>
reactions in stars, and they could tell us about conditions in the first
<BR>
fraction of a second of the life of the Universe. Strangest of all, there
<BR>
could be black holes inside you, and you wouldn't even notice.
<BR>
<P>In an ordinary atom, negatively charged electrons orbit positively charged
<BR>
protons and uncharged neutrons, which are clumped into a tiny nucleus 1/100
<BR>
000th the diameter of the atom. There is no reason why this central positive
<BR>
charge could not be provided by something else, as long as it is small
<BR>
enough. But how could black holes fit the bill?
<BR>
<P>Astronomers have detected several black holes in our Galaxy, the relics of
<BR>
massive stars which gravity has crushed out of existence (see page 28). These
<BR>
holes weigh several times as much as the Sun, and are a few kilometres
<BR>
across--hardly a handy size to slip inside an atom. Even less suitable are
<BR>
the colossal black holes with billions of times the mass of the Sun that
<BR>
power quasars (see page 32). But theorists think that microscopic black holes
<BR>
might have been squeezed into existence in the first split second after the
<BR>
big bang. It is these that could form the kernels of black hole atoms.
<BR>
<P>To make an atom, a primordial black hole would have to carry a positive
<BR>
electrical charge, just as a nucleus does. Flambaum says that black holes are
<BR>
more likely to be charged than not. &quot;They get their charge simply by
<BR>
swallowing charged particles,&quot; he says. &quot;It could be negative or positive,
<BR>
depending on what they swallow.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But to make a substitute nucleus, a black hole must also be stable--which
<BR>
microscopic black holes aren't supposed to be. In 1971, the Cambridge
<BR>
University physicist Stephen Hawking showed that black holes radiate
<BR>
subatomic particles, causing them to slowly evaporate away. As the hole
<BR>
becomes smaller, the sleet of particles becomes a ferocious blizzard, until
<BR>
the last shred of the black hole vanishes in a blast of radiation. On the
<BR>
face of it, this spells death to any black hole atom. However, Flambaum and
<BR>
Berengut reckon that Hawking's evaporation could eventually stop, leaving a
<BR>
tiny, long-lived black hole behind.
<BR>
<P>Jacob Beckenstein discovered in 1995 that the area of a black hole's event
<BR>
horizon--the boundary which marks the point of no return for in-falling
<BR>
matter--is quantised. In other words, it can only have certain discrete
<BR>
values. As a hole evaporates, its area, and therefore its mass, falls step by
<BR>
step. By the time it has only a few quanta of horizon area left, Hawking's
<BR>
calculations break down. No one can work out exactly what should happen, but
<BR>
many physicists think the black hole might stop evaporating altogether, or at
<BR>
least hang around for many billions of years before evaporating. To conserve
<BR>
such physical quantities as charge and angular momentum, the residual black
<BR>
hole would have to turn into a collection of particles with very particular
<BR>
properties--something that quantum mechanics makes highly improbable.
<BR>
<P>If so, the Universe could be awash with charged primordial black holes of
<BR>
about a Planck mass, or 0·00001 grams. They would have an incredibly tiny
<BR>
radius of 10-35 metres. And in the aeons they have been drifting through the
<BR>
gas of interstellar space, they would have gathered about them a cloud of
<BR>
electrons to neutralise their positive charge. &quot;The electrons would orbit
<BR>
just like in a normal atom,&quot; says Flambaum.
<BR>
<P><P>Super-atoms
<BR>
<P><P>If such a beast were to run into the Earth, it could get trapped on the
<BR>
surface and become lodged in a rock, in a laboratory bench, or even in your
<BR>
head. What would this super-atom be like?
<BR>
<P>At first glance, there appears to be no limit to the number of orbiting
<BR>
electrons a black hole atom can have--it should depend merely on the charge
<BR>
of the black hole. It is easy to imagine atoms with a thousand electrons, or
<BR>
a million. But it turns out that there are limits: a fundamental one, and a
<BR>
practical one set by the age of the Universe.
<BR>
<P>The fundamental limit was discovered by the British physicist Paul Dirac. He
<BR>
knew that in a normal atom, an electron is prevented from spiralling into the
<BR>
nucleus by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Electrons are attracted by the
<BR>
positive charge on the nucleus, but any electron trying to orbit too close to
<BR>
the nucleus would be stuck in a very confined space. According to the
<BR>
uncertainty principle that means it would have to move very fast, too fast to
<BR>
be trapped there by the electrical attraction of the nucleus.
<BR>
<P>But if the nucleus has a very large charge, the increased pull would be
<BR>
enough to overwhelm the uncertainty principle. &quot;Dirac found that for an atom
<BR>
with more than 137 electrons there are no stable electron orbits,&quot; says
<BR>
Flambaum. &quot;All electrons spiral down to nuclear oblivion.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So any charged black holes that formed in the big bang could not have
<BR>
collected more than 137 electrons. Any surplus would have been swallowed by
<BR>
the hole almost instantly, cancelling out part of its positive electrical
<BR>
charge.
<BR>
<P>But that's not the only constraint. Any hole that started out with a charge
<BR>
as high as 137 would be less charged by now, because it turns out that
<BR>
electrons don't have to spiral in to be gobbled up. An electron isn't a
<BR>
discrete little ball: its existence is actually smeared out. This means that
<BR>
a small part of the existence is always within the black hole's horizon,
<BR>
which translates into a small probability that the electron will be
<BR>
swallowed. This probability increases with the cube of the charge on the
<BR>
hole. So highly charged black hole atoms quickly polish off their inner
<BR>
electrons. According to Flambaum, the most complex black hole atoms that we
<BR>
could expect to see in today's Universe would have 70 electrons,
<BR>
corresponding to the element ytterbium.
<BR>
<P>If experimenters were to trap a black hole atom in their lab, what would it
<BR>
look like? The wavelength of light emitted by a normal atom depends on the
<BR>
energy levels that its electrons can occupy. These are affected slightly by
<BR>
the motion of the nucleus: a nucleus moves a little as a result of the pull
<BR>
of an electron orbiting it, just as the Sun wobbles slightly under the
<BR>
influence of the Earth's gravity. The effect in an ordinary atom is to shift
<BR>
the wavelength by a tiny amount from what it would be if the nucleus were
<BR>
immovable--that is, if its mass were infinite. &quot;But a Planck mass black hole
<BR>
is effectively an infinite mass,&quot; says Flambaum. &quot;So you wouldn't get the
<BR>
shift you get for a normal atom. Such a difference would be easy to see with
<BR>
modern instruments.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>A more dramatic effect would occur if an inner electron was gobbled. Then the
<BR>
black hole atom would do a quick change. A cadmium black hole atom with 48
<BR>
electrons would spontaneously turn into a silver black hole atom with 47
<BR>
electrons. And as the hole's mass depends on its charge, such a
<BR>
transformation would produce a huge burst of radiation.
<BR>
<P>So what are the odds of detecting a black hole atom, either in space or on
<BR>
Earth? It really depends on how many of them are kicking around the Universe.
<BR>
We can get a rough idea of the maximum possible number by postulating that
<BR>
the Universe's invisible &quot;dark matter&quot; is made entirely of black hole atoms.
<BR>
&quot;At best we could hope for one black hole atom for every 1000 trillion
<BR>
trillion hydrogen atoms,&quot; says Flambaum. &quot;That would make them about 30 times
<BR>
rarer than uranium atoms.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So there is no doubt that black hole atoms would be rare creatures, but
<BR>
Flambaum's point is that they might not be impossibly rare. He suggests that
<BR>
the best bet could be to look for their anomalous spectral lines in gas
<BR>
around the Sun. The real problem in detecting one would be in spotting its
<BR>
light amid the blaze of light from countless normal atoms. Flambaum admits
<BR>
that this would be quite a challenge.
<BR>
<P><P>Exotic entities
<BR>
<P><P>Atoms with a positively-charged black hole in their hearts may seem weird.
<BR>
But Flambaum and Berengut have imagined some even more exotic entities,
<BR>
formed when a minimum-mass black hole has a negative charge. &quot;Instead of
<BR>
gathering electrons about it as it travelled through space, it could gather
<BR>
protons or even nuclei,&quot; says Flambaum. Such a &quot;protonic&quot; atom would be about
<BR>
2000 times smaller than a normal atom--so small that short-range nuclear
<BR>
forces would come into play. Two protons in orbit around a hole would react
<BR>
to form a deuterium nucleus. Such a reaction, which is the first step in the
<BR>
process of making sunlight, takes about 10 billion years to happen in the
<BR>
Sun. However, it would happen much faster around a black hole, where the two
<BR>
protons are close enough for nuclear forces to snap them together.
<BR>
<P>The arrival of a third proton would trigger the nuclear reaction to make
<BR>
helium-3, and the process carry on to build ever heavier nuclei around the
<BR>
black hole. Flambaum and Berengut point out that the nuclei would be very
<BR>
different from normal nuclei, which have to contain large numbers of neutrons
<BR>
to glue them together because of the tremendous electrical repulsion between
<BR>
protons. But around a black hole, the protons would be squeezed together by
<BR>
the hole's gravity. &quot;Consequently, you would expect nuclei far richer in
<BR>
protons than normal nuclei,&quot; says Flambaum. This type of black hole atom
<BR>
could act as a catalyst for building new elements in stars. The energy
<BR>
released in the reaction could make a nucleus fly off, allowing new protons
<BR>
to be captured.
<BR>
<P>Another, weirder possibility, arises because a proton is a very large object
<BR>
compared with a point-like black hole. From the point of view of the hole, a
<BR>
proton is not a single object but an assembly of three quarks. &quot;This means
<BR>
that there is the possibility of the proton actually losing one of its quarks
<BR>
to the black hole,&quot; says Flambaum. The black hole would then possess colour
<BR>
charge, a property thought to be the preserve of quarks alone. In effect it
<BR>
would become a superheavy quark, and from a distance the whole system of two
<BR>
quarks orbiting a quark black hole would appear to be a superheavy proton. If
<BR>
we could cap- ture these weird particles they would make a great test bed for
<BR>
theories of how quarks interact with each other. The snag is that they'd be
<BR>
very hard to catch. They are so small that they would fall between the
<BR>
ordinary atoms of a solid and so could never be trapped on the Earth's
<BR>
surface.
<BR>
<P>But most significantly, black hole atoms might provide a window onto the very
<BR>
early Universe, all the way back to the first instant, within 10-43 seconds
<BR>
of the beginning. This is far earlier than any other relics, such as photons
<BR>
or neutrinos. According to Bernard Carr of Queen Mary and Westfield College
<BR>
in London, primordial black holes would tell us how lumpy the early Universe
<BR>
was. They might even preserve a memory of a time when the fundamental
<BR>
constants of nature were different from their values today. For example, in
<BR>
some cosmological models the strength of gravity varies in the very early
<BR>
Universe. Relic black holes might record this variation in the values of
<BR>
their mass.
<BR>
<P>So although Flambaum admits that black hole atoms of all types would be very
<BR>
difficult to detect, the rewards could be great. &quot;Looking for them has got to
<BR>
be worth a try,&quot; he says. Just don't expect to see black hole paperweights in
<BR>
the shops any time soon.
