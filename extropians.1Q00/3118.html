<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of genetic epistemology was created and developed 
<BR>
by Jean Piaget (one of the three great French structuralists, along 
<BR>
wuth Claude Levi-Strauss and A. J. Greimas), who referred to his 
<BR>
position as constructivist, reflecting his conviction that structure 
<BR>
and function are inseparable in any particular instance (1970: 85-
<BR>
93), and his certainty that the structures which he studied 
<BR>
demonstrated an evolving dynamic equilibration which is better 
<BR>
described by homeorhesis than homeostasis, and which 
<BR>
resembles Prigogine's dissipative structures (1975: 3-4).  For 
<BR>
Piaget, the evolution, by construction, of more inclusive, 
<BR>
differentiated and interconnected structions from simpler, more 
<BR>
limited and more isolated ones involves the struggle for wholeness 
<BR>
by means of a system of self-regulating transformations (1968: 3-
<BR>
16).  This isomorphic psychgenesis of subject-knowledge and 
<BR>
object-knowledge proceeds through six levels; the senorimotor 
<BR>
level, the first and second levels of preoperational thought, the first 
<BR>
and second levels of concrete operations, and the level of formal 
<BR>
operations.  The guiding principle in the continuous construction of 
<BR>
this system in human development is a dynamic dialectic between 
<BR>
assimilation and accommodation.  Assimilation integrates, strives 
<BR>
for internal consistency of structure, and generates necessities, 
<BR>
while accommodation differentiates, strives for external coherency 
<BR>
between a structure and the many world-situations in which it 
<BR>
functions, and generates possibilities.  This evolution of action 
<BR>
schemes is recapitulated in the learning of sign systems.  For 
<BR>
instance, children learn to apply the signs &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; to the 
<BR>
concrete particular pets signified by these terms (or in other words 
<BR>
learn their meaning) before they integrate them into &quot;animal&quot; or 
<BR>
differentiate them into &quot;persian&quot;, &quot;siamese&quot;, &quot;poodle&quot;, &quot;terrier&quot;, etc. 
<BR>
(1983: 94-97).  The interplay of these two processes is most 
<BR>
concisely presented in Piaget's two postulates which her makes 
<BR>
clear have been inductively derived from experiental resultes.  They 
<BR>
are (1) &quot;every assimilatory scheme tends to incorporate external 
<BR>
elements that are compatible with it&quot;, and (2) &quot;Every assimilatory 
<BR>
scheme has to be accommodated to the elements it assimilates, 
<BR>
but the changes made to adapt it to an object's peculiarities must 
<BR>
be effected without loss of continuity&quot; (1975: 6).  In other words, an 
<BR>
infant may co-ordinate eye and hand in learning to grasp a rattle 
<BR>
lying beside it; the infant may then generalize this procedure to 
<BR>
allow it to grasp objects in different positions relative to it and/or of 
<BR>
different shapes and sizes without, however, losing what is specific 
<BR>
to the act of grasping the seen within the thicket of the act's 
<BR>
multiple particular elaborations.  Assimilation plus accommodation 
<BR>
equals adaptation, or equilibration.  Equilibration occurs between 
<BR>
&quot;assimilation of objects to schemes of action and accommodation 
<BR>
of schemes of action to objects&quot; (a &quot;function of the fundamental 
<BR>
interconnection between subject and object&quot;), between two 
<BR>
subsystems of a system (reciprocal assimilation leading to mutual 
<BR>
conservation), and between a system and its subsystems.  
<BR>
Equilibration also involves correspondence between affirmations 
<BR>
(yes, this element can be assimilated/accommodated) and 
<BR>
negations (no, this element can't be assimilated/accommodated), 
<BR>
or between similarity ans disparity in the aspect or aspects salient 
<BR>
to a scheme (1975: 5-10).  The phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch 
<BR>
considered dispositions and character traits, or &quot;psychic 
<BR>
constants&quot;, to be formed in a like manner, as &quot;systematic unities 
<BR>
of experienced facts rather than the facts themselves&quot;, and 
<BR>
demonstrating a causal unity (1985: 15-16).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disequilibria result when a trial produces an error (when the 
<BR>
applied scheme fails), or when there is no suitable scheme 
<BR>
available to apply; in other words, disequilibrium results from 
<BR>
perturbations, defined as &quot;anything that creates obstacles to 
<BR>
assimilation or to achieving a goal&quot; (1975: 16).  These perturbations 
<BR>
motivate &quot;searching&quot;, a &quot;strik[ing] out in new directions&quot;.  Progress 
<BR>
results from the accommodation of an existing sheme to the task 
<BR>
or the assimilation of the task to an existing scheme, or from the 
<BR>
development of a ner scheme which succeeds, i.e. when 
<BR>
&quot;disequilibria...give rise to developments that surpass what has 
<BR>
previously existed&quot; (1975: 10-15).  Obviously, feedback is essential 
<BR>
to this process; positive feedback reinforces a scheme, and 
<BR>
negative feedback undermines it.  These complementary feedback 
<BR>
schemes are termed regulations, and they react to perturbations 
<BR>
by means of compensations.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations may act to conserve or to modify schemes, or to 
<BR>
mediate between them.  They may act by means of automatic 
<BR>
compensations, requiring little attention, or active compensations, 
<BR>
rwquiring a choice to be made or changed.  For Piaget, active 
<BR>
regulations &quot;lead to conscious awareness&quot; and &quot;lie at the source of 
<BR>
the representation or conceptualization of material actions.&quot;  There 
<BR>
may be simple regulations, regulations of regulations, ttc., 
<BR>
hierarchically ordered, up to autoregulations, which make self-
<BR>
organization possible.  The evolving system is open, that is, it 
<BR>
continually advances and never reaches completion, for there are 
<BR>
always further advances to be made, and novel situations to 
<BR>
confront.  This process of equilibration towards ever better 
<BR>
equilibrium, i.e. more extensive, efficient, precise and 
<BR>
interconnected cognitive systems, Piaget calls optimization (1975: 
<BR>
16-26).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Piaget, cognizance &quot;proceeds from the periphery 
<BR>
to the center(s).&quot;  Periphery is the interface between organism and 
<BR>
environment (therefore peripheral to both), and lies in the relation 
<BR>
between proprioceived bodily action and perceived worldly 
<BR>
phenomena (which according to merleau-Ponty are correlational 
<BR>
and mutually grounding).  Center (S) is the subject's operational 
<BR>
scheme, and Center (O) is the array of intrinsic properties 
<BR>
attributed to the object.  Movement from the periphery towards one 
<BR>
center is correlational with movement toward the other, thus the 
<BR>
&quot;understanding of objects&quot; and the &quot;conceptualization of actions&quot; 
<BR>
advance isomorphically.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending Piaget's model of human development, Lewis and 
<BR>
Brooks-Gunn have investigated the ontogeny of human self-
<BR>
recognition by means of mirror studies of infants.  The area is 
<BR>
important, due to the fact that chimpanzees, bonoboes, gorillas 
<BR>
and orangutans, the only nonhuman terrestrial life forms who have 
<BR>
arguably been able to learn prephonemic sign systems (although 
<BR>
not to create them), are also able to recognize themselves in a 
<BR>
mirror; the lesser apes treat their own image as they would treat 
<BR>
unfamiliar conspecifics (members of the same species).  They 
<BR>
discovered that human infants placed before a mirror reacted 
<BR>
differently to their reflections depending upon age.  As early as one 
<BR>
month of age, infants will gaze at their reflections.  At 5-8 months 
<BR>
of age, they will smile at and touch the mirror (mirror-directed 
<BR>
behavior).  At 9-12 months of age, they will move rhythmically as 
<BR>
they watch their image also move (play with contingency).  At 15-
<BR>
18 months of age infants will act coy before their reflections.  If 
<BR>
rouge is applied to their noses prior to their exposure to a mirror, a 
<BR>
few in this age group will touch their own noses (self-directed 
<BR>
behavior) rather than the noses in the mirror.  No infants younger 
<BR>
than fifteen months exhibited this behavior; practically all infants 21-
<BR>
24 months old did 
<BR>
(1979: 212-219).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewis and brooks-Gunn also exposed infants to videotapes of themselves, thus 
<BR>
eliminating the contingent relation between action and image.  They discovered 
<BR>
that person-permanence is correlated with mirror-contingent self-recognition 
<BR>
and conditioned affective reactions, and that object-permanence, 
<BR>
occurring later, is correlated with self-permanence ans specific 
<BR>
emotional experience (1979: 222-228).  The experimenters 
<BR>
concluded, on the basis of their data, that at birth, behavior is a 
<BR>
combination of random movements and innate reflexes, which 
<BR>
function as a means to engage the infant with its environment.  
<BR>
These innate reflexes gradually fade, replaced by cognitive 
<BR>
structures formed by infant-environment interaction.  These 
<BR>
structures incerasingly take control of behavior.  By approximately 
<BR>
three months of age, reflexes and cognitions exercise roughly 
<BR>
equal dominion, afther which cognitions progressivelt dominate 
<BR>
(1979: 241-245).
