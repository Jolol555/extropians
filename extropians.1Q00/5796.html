<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Such claims are typically bogus. The only people who do not like colonial rule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are the local native aristocracy that aren't allowed to abuse their people any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way they want to any more...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do you know this?  There seemed to be quite a bit of swelling of ethnic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pride when Hong Kong was turned over the  Chinese. Are people so rational as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer good government to a corrupt government, when ethnic pride and massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propaganda exists to push them the other way?
</EM><BR>
<P>The (admittedly few) people I talked with about this (I visited friends
<BR>
in HK a couple of weeks after the handover) basically thought the changeover
<BR>
wasn't a big deal - they were taking a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude as to
<BR>
what the Chinese government would do.  None expected anything drastic
<BR>
right away - if anything, China would become more restrictive (and kill
<BR>
the golden goose) over time.  The celebrations were put on by large
<BR>
corporations kowtowing to the new power; people everywhere enjoy a
<BR>
week-long vacation (for many in HK, a day off is rare enough) and a big
<BR>
party.
<BR>
<P>All the people I knew had also arranged to get overseas passports of one
<BR>
sort or another (Canada and the US were popular) so they could bail out
<BR>
if need be.  There was serious resentment toward the British about the
<BR>
passport situation, but HK'ers are practical and businesslike if nothing
<BR>
else and found ways around the problem.  I didn't see anything I'd
<BR>
call &gt;ethnic&lt; pride.  (massive propaganda yes, but people seemed to see it
<BR>
for what it was.).   That's what I saw anyway.  The situation was a bit 
<BR>
different than the 3rd/4th World colonial pullout.
<BR>
<P>So, yes, given the case of HK, I'd say people can be that rational,
<BR>
especially people who have lived the alternative.
