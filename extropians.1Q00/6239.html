The way I see it, by the time humanity reaches the level of technological
<BR>
sophistication required to produce practical applications of distributed
<BR>
nanotechnology (which i believe was a major impetus for Zero's conclusion of
<BR>
the necessity of universal transparency - so we can all sleep at night
<BR>
despite the knowledge that any citizen Joe can build a black-hole generator,
<BR>
or whatever, with nanobots), the issue of 'SCARCITY of computing power', (a
<BR>
basis for one opposing argument: the 'strong' will get 'stronger' via
<BR>
exploitation of a larger part of the video-data-processing rescource pool)
<BR>
probably won't exist.  Perhaps this results from my particular skewed vision
<BR>
of the implementation of nanotechnology, but I suspect it will require
<BR>
considerable computational rescources to apply and distribute it to that
<BR>
level of sophistication in the first place.  Additionally, I envision an
<BR>
upper bound to the efficacy of hoarding and expending such rescources to
<BR>
'watch all our neighbors', especially when you consider an emergent paranoid
<BR>
necessity to 'watch all our neighbors watch us watch them', etc., ad
<BR>
infinitum.

<EM>&gt; Subject:	Re: Surveilance was: Transhuman fascists?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following?':
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Look, my whole argument is that you can't guarantee yourself access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;server, even if you can assure yourself access to the cameras.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;these servers are government owned and government run.  The government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;take away the servers, and THEN where would you be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Now you are assuming that the servers would be government owned and run.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never suggested this.  I don't even know that the sytem would need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on any central &quot;servers.&quot;  Even if some sort of central server were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; required, it would seem to make much more sense to me if the servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distributed, robust and redundant without any one hierarchical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controlling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; body.  Think Usenet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am.  Part of the trouble here is that Usenet distributes information,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without much processing after people type it in.  This is comparatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy and cheap.  In addition, Usenet is a system where the more people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are using it, the more useful it becomes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The servers you're describing are quite the reverse.  Relevance servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run best when it's only serving up the information relevant to me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (because it's searching the same data only once, for only one list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;relevant&quot; things) works about half as well when it's serving up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information relevant to both of us, etc.  With Usenet, I get some benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from sharing it with you.  With the Relevance servers, I get much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit from keeping it away from you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And even if it was necessary to have some sort of central oversight 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; committee (which I doubt) there is no reason why it would have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solely of government employees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're right.  Some private citizens could own a few Relevance servers as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well.  But since they'd be a scarce resource and more useful the fewer get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to use it, you can bet that they'd be expensive.  So, once again, only the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful (this time the rich) get access to the Relevance servers.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that still means that the gov't could shut them down if they wanted to;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or, barring that, simply that the poor get monitored with no access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Relevance whereas the rich and gov't officials get monitored with lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to Relevance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And, further, assuming that (1) it is necessary to have a centralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't need it to be singular; I just need there to be a small number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centers, which is likely, because, unlike the Internet, this resource is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less useful as it is shared.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system and (2) it is necessary to have a single hierarchical controlling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That needn't be the case.  So long as there are only a few centers, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gov't could seize control of them if it wanted to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; again as long as the body and its personnel and its decisions and its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actions were sufficiently transparent, it would not matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You keep insisting on that.  But even if you doubt my claim that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despotism could arise, you must admit that if it DID arise, transparency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Have you ever *heard* of the US?  Have you ever been there?  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what you have read about democracy, but you obviously have never seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ours 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The most vivid example we have of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;despot rising to power where there was once a democracy was Hitler.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;you wanted to be a despot in America, you'd do it the way he did it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well much as that might make for an interesting thought experiment, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going to pursue it further.  I don't see any despot rising to power in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US or in *any* similarly constitutional democracy.  Keep singing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; song if you want, fact of the matter is it ain't gonna happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look at it this way.  If you're right about our country, then it's not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact about transparency that makes you right.  It's a fact about the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the citizens of the United States are.  In a different place, or at some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other time, you'd be wrong about what the people were like, and under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those circumstances, a despotism *could* happen.  So I could even concede
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to you that, right now, a despotism in America is unthinkable, even with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ubiquitous surveilance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, American culture need not always be like that.  It could one day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be more like China, or Soviet Russia, or France, or India, or Germany or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tibet, or who knows what.  So insisting that despotism will NEVER happen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in this country seems much too strong a principle for anyone to support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I actually DO think that America is prone to despotism today, but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's too strong a cultural claim to support here; besides, I don't need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that argument to justify my point, so it's not relevant.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, I've argued time and time again that the powerful get more use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of this system than the weak.  I'll now weaken my claim to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following: in the sort of state where despotism is possible, a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which empowers the powerful and weakens the weak makes despotism easier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and more likely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if you bought my line of argument above, despotism is *possible*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everywhere, though it may be fifty or even 100 years down the road.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact that this system would make despotism easier when (not if) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time is ripe for it implies to me that this system should, to whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extent possible, be avoided.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Not if the despot manages to get a mandate from the people first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hitler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;you'll recall, had the popular vote.  How would a transparent society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;prevented Hitler from rising to power?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A constitutional democracy like that in the US (transparent or not)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have prevented Hitler from rising to power.  Because it is simply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unconstitutional to become a despot in the US.  The only way to do it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (1) *drastically* amend, or throw out the constitution or (2) militarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take over.  One *last* time, that is *NOT* going to happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if I agreed with you here: do you think the Constitution will last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forever?  What happens when the US federal gov't as such is replaced?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What will become of this country?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take the long view on this one.
</EM><BR>
