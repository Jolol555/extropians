I think Kubrick was the best director who ever lived, I wish he'd made it. I 
<BR>
know he worked on AI for well over 15 years but somehow it never got 
<BR>
finished, all sorts of rumors why.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I was shocked to hear he had died and very sad that he never got to film 
<BR>
_AI_ which will not be the same in Spielburg's hands, though he may do an 
<BR>
excellent job, we will see.
<BR>
<P>I recently saw, _Mission to Mars_ which was good but not great.  I could not 
<BR>
help but compare the ending of it with the final scenes of _2001_ which was 
<BR>
infinitely better.  I noticed how in some ways they attempted to copy 
<BR>
Kubrick's masterpiece but were hopelessly inadequate in doing so.  The way 
<BR>
Kubrick shifted the pov and used lighting and set design was sheer genius in 
<BR>
showing Bowman's lifecycle.
<BR>
<P>SPOILER!!
<BR>
<P>I was touched when the Martian in _Mission to Mars_ showed a holographic 
<BR>
image of a young Mars being hit by a comet and the planet being plunged into 
<BR>
chaos.  As time passed the Martians sent out ships to find new homes in the 
<BR>
galaxy.  But somehow the story, writing, alien fx and characterization and 
<BR>
film direction were just not up to the task of achieving the level of 
<BR>
emotional power needed to do the film right.  The cast was top-notch (except 
<BR>
for the Sliders' guy! lol) and so that was not the problem.  I thought Brian 
<BR>
DePalma would have been up to the task, oh well.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
