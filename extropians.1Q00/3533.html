<EM>&gt;From: Joseph Sterlynne &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vxs@mailandnews.com?Subject=Re:%20Uploading%20and%20Consciousness%20(was:%20electronic%20intelligence%20and%20ethics)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000225062330.202.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">vxs@mailandnews.com</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The real problem (which you might have been referring to) is the notion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we want our consciousness to feel continuous during the upload procedure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So that you feel like you have actively migrated to the upload computer, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like you're still sitting in the operating room watching your new copy run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off having a great time.  The soft slow replacement method that Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned would appear to give us the former.  A scan of some sort would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem to result in the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem, though, is this: does it matter at all.  If a brain is scanned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the process which is consciousness is the same in both brains then both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will consider themselves to be the same identity.  Both will claim to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been (and one will claim to still be) in the original body.
</EM><BR>
<P>It will matter to me.  Although my megalomania drives me to reach for 
<BR>
immortality, it does not drive me to create numerous identical consciousness 
<BR>
clones of myself.  If you scan my brain and upload the neural patterns of my 
<BR>
personality into a computer, that will not mean beans to me.  *I* want to 
<BR>
transform.  Simply copying me, while it may be great for the copy, won't do 
<BR>
a thing for me.  And no, I don't think it will make me feel any better if 
<BR>
you offer to kill me immediately after the upload is done so that there is 
<BR>
only one me left.  That software in the computer might think its me, but you 
<BR>
know, and I know that will not be me.
<BR>
<P>I'll definitely opt for the gradual brain replacement method, thank you.
