<EM>&gt; Current research models are projected to add a minimum of $1000.00 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cost of each gun if put in production, which also decreases their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reliability, as gun recoil is NOT something that electronics are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly good at dealing with on a frequent basis, and compact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power supplies are notoriously short lived.
</EM><BR>
<P>a) I'm fairly sure that there is more than $1000 worth of safety devices
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the average automobile.  If it is potential killing machine, it should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineered to be relatively safe.  Thats a pretty simple principle.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument that guns should remain cheap doesn't cut it IMO.  While the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constituation may say you can own one or more of the devices, it doesn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say they have to be cheap.  &quot;Big brother&quot; is mandating devices become safer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and safer (look at lawnmowers for example, its getting darn difficult to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave them &quot;running&quot;).  Why?  Because there are too many people out there
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who are candidates for Darwin awards who have to be protected from their own
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stupidity.  One can argue that &quot;natural selection&quot; is good.  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be countered by the fact that humans are imperfect machines and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protecting us from our own occasional mistakes is probably a good thing.
<BR>
<P>b) I believe that current engineering for shock tolerant disk drives
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(to be dropped from a foot or more) should be more than sufficient for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gun recoil.
<BR>
<P>c) Ideally you would want the power to come from the user's hand.  That
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be difficult without nanotech.  However a heat sensor wired to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercury cell to enable the recognition electronics should last for years.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to put oil, water and gas in your car and even bullets in your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gun, it doesn't change the equation that much to say you have to change
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the batteries (or leave it in the sun for a day to recharge it) every year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Additionally, such technology limits the gun's use to the OWNER.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Other family members or employees would not be able to use them.
</EM><BR>
<P>If its reasonable technology, it should be programmable to recognize
<BR>
multiple fingerprints, retina scans, grips, voice commands, etc.  The
<BR>
point would be that it shouldn't fire for *any* non-authorized user.
<BR>
That doesn't solve domestic violence problems, but could make a small
<BR>
dent in the problems caused by guns that are stolen or used against
<BR>
their owners.
