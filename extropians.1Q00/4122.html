<P><EM>&gt; What is my definition of &quot;existence&quot;?  I don't offer one.  Instead, I accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rand's view that existence is an axiomatic concept -- any attempt to define
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it results in a circular definition, any attempt to deny it assumes it.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are willing, Daniel, to more or less identify &quot;existence&quot;, &quot;actuality&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;event&quot;, then the definition can proceed along the lines of &quot;that
<BR>
which can be located within, and specified in terms of, an n-dimensional
<BR>
manifold&quot;. Of necessity, this manifold is metric; for example, &quot;time&quot; is
<BR>
metrical time, not &quot;duration&quot; etc.  If you apply the Principle of Sufficient
<BR>
Reason to the &quot;manifold&quot;, you encounter new problems.
<BR>
<P>This gets us away from the linguistic traps set by the conflation of the
<BR>
&quot;is&quot; of predication [description] and the &quot;is&quot; of identity.
<BR>
<P>The approach I personally prefer is to treat things as &quot;virtual objects&quot;
<BR>
which which &quot;exist&quot; only in terms of their relations with each other.
<BR>
That is, they are completely specified by their relationships. To have
<BR>
relationships is to exist.
<BR>
<P>None of the above is a panacea; the major hurdle to overcome is the
<BR>
confusion of epistemology and ontology when trying get your bearings.
