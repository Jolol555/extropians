<EM>&gt; Why Trade is Good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Imagine, if you will, a society consisting of people which has agreed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the enforcement of private property is morally legitimate.  Imagine also a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wide variety of different goods being held by these persons, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have different, independent ideas of the value of these goods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Barter becomes an obvious means by which people can maximize the value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their goods: if Alice has got Apples and Bob has got Bananas, and Alice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; values Bananas more than she values Apples, and Bob values Apples more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than he values Bananas, they can efficiently trade to acquire more of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they value.  Call this a &quot;direct&quot; trade.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is *not* why trade is good.
<BR>
<P>I realize, of course, that Dan Fabulich has correctly stated the
<BR>
accepted contemporary theory of trade.  I take exception to that theory,
<BR>
and that's one of the reasons I advocate complex barter.
<BR>
<P>The reason I disagree with this theory is that it's static.  Alice
<BR>
already has the Apples and Bob already has the Bananas.  The theory
<BR>
doesn't talk about production, or about where the Apples and Bananas
<BR>
come from.  The static analysis presents a clear &quot;potential energy
<BR>
surface&quot; in which a set of local quantitative valuations is enough to
<BR>
easily compute the space of beneficial global transactions, and it's
<BR>
likewise easy to navigate to a point in that space using a set of global
<BR>
quantitative valuations determined by supply and demand.  There's no
<BR>
point in complex analysis because the utility of Apples or Bananas is
<BR>
simply the joy experienced by the person consuming that Apple or Banana,
<BR>
and there's no functional difference between valuing that joy in Cattle
<BR>
or valuing it in Diamonds.
<BR>
<P>The utility of trade is *specialization*.  A smith can produce iron
<BR>
weapons more cheaply than a hunter, and an experienced hunter can
<BR>
produce meat more cheaply than a smith.  The *reason* that Alice has
<BR>
Apples is that she's an Apple-Farmer.  Alice, however, requires a
<BR>
certain number of Bananas in order to survive; in fact, the more Bananas
<BR>
she eats, the more efficient she is at Apple-Farming.  And the
<BR>
symmetrical situation holds for Bob the Banana-Farmer.  If Alice eats 6
<BR>
Bananas instead of 3 Bananas, she can produce 10 Apples instead of 5
<BR>
Apples.  And if Bob eats 4 Apples instead of 2 Apples, he can produce 7
<BR>
Bananas instead of 3 Bananas.
<BR>
<P>The sensible thing to do is for Alice to give 2 Apples to Bob, and Bob
<BR>
to give 3 Bananas to Alice.  This way, Alice produces another 5 Apples
<BR>
and Bob produces another 4 Bananas, they both win.  Alice can give 2 of
<BR>
those Apples to Bob next year, leaving her with an extra 3 Apples, and
<BR>
Bob can give 3 Bananas to Alice, leaving him with an extra 1 Banana. 
<BR>
The dynamic increase in wealth - not just utility, but actual wealth -
<BR>
is 3 Apples and 1 Banana.  Of course, Alice clearly profits more from
<BR>
this transaction than Bob, which raises questions of fairness, which is
<BR>
a whole big bag of worms that I'm not going to open right now.
<BR>
<P>In a sense, though, even this simple two-person interaction is enough to
<BR>
demonstrate the reason for complex barter.  What is the utility of a
<BR>
Banana to Alice?  Does it equal 2 Apples?  Does it equal 3 Bananas,
<BR>
which she can get if she gives Bob the 2 Apples?  Does it equal 5
<BR>
Apples, which she can produce if she eats the 3 Bananas she can get if
<BR>
she gives Bob the 2 Apples she can produce if she eats the Banana? 
<BR>
Actually, this is carrying things too far; the simple paradox, the
<BR>
reason that static analysis is inadequate, should be clear the instant
<BR>
we ask whether the utility of 1 Banana equals 3 Bananas.
<BR>
<P>I realize that this reasoning can be duplicated using a single currency,
<BR>
but what I'm trying to convey is the *intuitive* reason behind complex
<BR>
barter.  There's a *physical* interaction between Apples and Bananas,
<BR>
and therefore a reason to compute the value of Apples in Bananas instead
<BR>
of computing it in Diamonds.  Any analysis of utility functions that
<BR>
leaves out the genuine physical interaction is going to leave out the
<BR>
raison d'etre of complex barter.
<BR>
<P>The way that a single-currency system handles the dynamic problem is to
<BR>
talk about interest rates; the utility of the Banana to Alice is 2
<BR>
Apples now, or 5 Apples in one year.  But that assumes that Alice and
<BR>
Bob have already computed the barter; the currency valuation simply
<BR>
labels it, *it doesn't produce the transaction*.  If Alice and Bob are
<BR>
in the Marketplace, trying to buy things with Diamonds, they might
<BR>
starve to death where a complex-barter system would keep them alive.
<BR>
<P>Let's say that Drexler and Eric have mysterious boxes that produce
<BR>
Apples and Bananas for 1 Diamond apiece, while Alice's and Bob's cost is
<BR>
2 Diamonds apiece.  Nobody, not even Bob, would buy an Apple from Alice
<BR>
for 2 Diamonds; nobody, not even Alice, would buy a Banana from Bob for
<BR>
2 Diamonds.  Therefore, neither Alice nor Bob receive any Diamonds at
<BR>
all, neither can buy Bananas or Apples, and both starve.  (And God help
<BR>
this marketplace when Drexler and Eric start producing Diamonds from
<BR>
their box... but that's another issue.)
<BR>
<P>And yes, in this particular scenario, you can always ask why they don't
<BR>
sell their existing Apples or Bananas at the reduced price and use them
<BR>
to buy Bananas or Apples from Eric or Drexler.  But that's just an
<BR>
artifact of the way this particular scenario happens to work.  The
<BR>
problem, in essence, is that Alice, Bob, and Carol's Carrots have been
<BR>
priced out of the Marketplace.  They are not interacting with any other
<BR>
participant in the Marketplace, and therefore the prices set by the
<BR>
Marketplace are irrelevant.  The single-currency scenario can
<BR>
computationally solve the three-way-inequality problem, as Fabulich
<BR>
points out, but it can't solve the problem where the Alice-Bob-Carol
<BR>
production cycle values Carrots more than Apples but the Marketplace
<BR>
values Apples more than Carrots.  Unless Alice, Bob, and Carol expend
<BR>
the computational power to compute relative values based on their local
<BR>
virtuous-cycle trade instead of global values, they won't be able to see
<BR>
the virtuous cycle and consequently won't be able to engage in production.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, the conventional Libertarian answer - &quot;Okay, Alice, Bob, and
<BR>
Carol starve or go to work for Drexler and Eric&quot; - is again taking the
<BR>
scenario too literally.  The point I'm trying to make is that a single
<BR>
currency creates all kinds of shocks that get transmitted where they
<BR>
shouldn't be, and the false concept of a unified valuation causes Alice,
<BR>
Bob, and Carol to overlook beneficial transaction structures because
<BR>
local components are &quot;unfair&quot; with respect to a transaction carried on
<BR>
by Drexler and Eric a hundred miles away.
<BR>
<P>Of course, none of this deals with the *real* advantage of complex
<BR>
barter:  Complex barter futures, which protect virtuous cycles from
<BR>
pricing shocks.  In the current system, if Alice has 5 Apples (supply)
<BR>
and Bob and Carol each want 3 Apples, then Bob and Carol will bid
<BR>
against each other until they wind up paying 50 Diamonds an Apple; if
<BR>
Drexler comes along and produces 2 more Apples, then Alice and Drexler
<BR>
will bid against each other until they sell at 1 Diamond per apple, even
<BR>
if that's a loss.  As the Diamond pricing implies, you can get some of
<BR>
the benefit of complex barter futures from ordinary currency-transaction
<BR>
ubiquitous minifutures, but ordinary minifutures, considered in
<BR>
isolation, always involve the possibility of taking a loss on the
<BR>
transaction.  If you can take an entire virtuous cycle and protect it,
<BR>
then you can't possibly take a loss on the transaction; you can only
<BR>
make less of a gain than you would have otherwise.  
<BR>
<P>Again, the static analysis does not suffice to show the utility of
<BR>
complex barter futures.  Complex barter and complex barter futures have
<BR>
benefits that are only visible when you use production analysis, which
<BR>
takes into account physical interactions between products.
