<P><EM>&gt; Congratulations on the new job!  You must have a strong rep to have gotten a

<EM>&gt; new one so fast.  Enjoy your new bicycle.

<P>Thanks John.  Regarding the bicycle, its one of those recumbents
<BR>
that one sees occasionally.  Those work better for me; more
<BR>
comfortable than the traditional kind.  Also, there is less frontal
<BR>
area, so that makes for less wind resistance.
<BR>
<P>I had a thought while riding the other day.  Recumbents have never
<BR>
caught on much, but if they had been invented first, I wouldnt
<BR>
imagine the now-traditional knd would have caught on because
<BR>
of the discomfort of the seat.  There is evidence now that
<BR>
those narrow seats can crush the penile artery, leading to
<BR>
total and irreversible impotence.   [eeeeeeek!]
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, the lean-forward style of traditional bikes
<BR>
causes one to bend the neck up to see.  And even more
<BR>
than that, with traditional bikes if one is really cooking and
<BR>
needs to turn, the pedal can hit the ground, with very bad
<BR>
results, as my mother found out last year.  {8-[  Her bike
<BR>
even had coaster brakes only, so when she was hauling
<BR>
ass down the driveway, the pedals were in such a position
<BR>
she couldnt stop or turn, and so crashed and burned.  Shes
<BR>
OK now.
<BR>
<P>So, recumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.
<BR>
Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?  spike
