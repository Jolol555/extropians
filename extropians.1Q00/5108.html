Where you are living,it may take 30+ years to watch the restaurants turnover 
<BR>
(once per generation????) &amp; that is probably interesting.

<P>Anchorage is a prosperous town and we have alot of restaurants, with a 
<BR>
number of new ones opening each year.  Nothing compared to a big metropolis 
<BR>
I'm sure, but you would be impressed based on the size of our population.  I 
<BR>
know a nice little Aleut place down the corner!  You have never eaten Aleut? 
<BR>
lol

However, the *main* point to my &quot;freeze young&quot; proposal was in the context 
<BR>
where &quot;young&quot; means mentally &quot;adept&quot;or &quot;flexible&quot;. It is an open question 
<BR>
regarding the degree to which the brain &quot;solidifies&quot; as one accumulates 
<BR>
experiences,but it is clear that diseases like Alzheimer's, if allowed to 
<BR>
progress, give you a *clearly* different brain than the one you might like 
<BR>
to be able to recover.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Gotcha!  I understand now.  This is a major reason why a person should take 
<BR>
good care of their body and also why physican assisted deanimation would be 
<BR>
nice.  Get suspended while you are still in good shape.  I would be willing 
<BR>
to have five or ten years shaved off my lifespan for that.
<BR>
<P>We can still say 'freeze young' to appear sexy and cool like those 'die 
<BR>
young, leave a good-looking corpse' people. lol!!  And then put up a picture 
<BR>
of poor James Dean.

I'll offer to play the role of the technocrat who thinks tecnology will 
<BR>
solve all the problems, only to discover that solving one set leads to the 
<BR>
creation of another leading me to retire to reflect on the circular nature 
<BR>
of life on a beach in Costa Rica.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>And then as you are lying on that beach some native thug will kill you and 
<BR>
take your valuables! :(  A fitting end to such a sad tale.  Or as an 
<BR>
alternative ending, you will take out your pistol at the last moment and 
<BR>
kill your attacker!  Thus proving the importance of the current gun thread! 
<BR>
;)
