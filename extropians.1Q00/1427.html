<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   By raising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   enough money to implement such a strategy against multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   companies, a few are bound to hit for the big bucks, given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   the statistics of invalidity of most software patents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What is he referring to here regarding statistics?  Is it the case that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most patent suits against software patents go against the patent holder?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or a substantial percentage?  I had always heard that defeating patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was a costly and highly uncertain process, since the presumption is on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the validity of the patent once it issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I've heard a claim (I can't remember where) that some experts can find
<BR>
prior art for about 95% of the software patents they are hired to
<BR>
investigate. I haven't heard any claims that this can be done cheaply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In my field, cryptography, there are a lot of patents.  But I wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say that many of them could be overturned on the basis of prior art.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;My impression is that cryptography patents are not at all representative
<BR>
of typical software patents.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;People are creative, and there is no shortage of new ideas coming out all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time.  There is no reason a priori to expect most software patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be invalid.  Someone creative enough to get a paper published in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;refereed journal is capable of coming up with a patentable idea.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are hundreds of thousands of people like this.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;There is widespread confusion over what the PTO will consider patentable,
<BR>
and very little incentive for anyone to search for prior art until lawsuits
<BR>
are filed, so it seems quite possible that the typical software patent
<BR>
is filed by the tenth or twentieth person to &quot;invent&quot; the idea.
