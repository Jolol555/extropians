<EM>&gt; Its funny that people like you are the ones who say that Mutual Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Destruction is insane, when its the same exact principle. MAD assumes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neither party can be trusted, and only the external threat of instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; annihilation is what keeps both parties in check. The MAD strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely on the idea that both sides had to keep as total a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance on the others activities as possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>But did MAD work?  Angelo Codevilla, in _Informing Statecraft_ (see
<BR>
<A HREF="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html</A>), tells of how a lot of
<BR>
evidence came up in the 1980s and early 1990s that the Soviets, in fact,
<BR>
were preparing for an all out nuclear war.  Whether this was paranoia on
<BR>
their part or the planning stages of a first strike remains to be seen.
<BR>
That the Soviets also continued a military buildup -- in both conventional
<BR>
and nuclear forces -- seems to support the latter.
<BR>
<P>It's also notable that the Soviets mainly targeted, from what we know now,
<BR>
military and industrial centers -- not population centers.  (Granted, they
<BR>
often overlap, but the fact that they targetted when they did overlap sort
<BR>
of means they might have been really planning for a first strike.)
<BR>
<P>And MAD, as a US policy -- not a Soviet one, was only in place for about two
<BR>
decades.  Not enough of a sample in my mind to say it work or not.
<BR>
<P>I'm not about to join the John Birch Society hre, just pointing out some
<BR>
things I read.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; savages and have no honor or rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>Honor does not pay the rent.  Anyway, if one looks at honor as the desire to
<BR>
be moral, and if one doesn't accept the kind of Platonic morality Michael
<BR>
hints at, but the more worldly, Aristotelean or Objectivist one I tend
<BR>
toward, then the goal of morality is successful life -- not to be honorable
<BR>
in spite of what will be, but to be honorable in hopes of what will be.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
