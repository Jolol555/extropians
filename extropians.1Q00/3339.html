<EM>&gt;     &gt;There must be real scientific ways to discover such phenomenal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;qualities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why must there be?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not interrested in anything that can't be really or
<BR>
scientifically observed, reproduced, and so on and so forth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what my salty is like, I know what my red is like, I
<BR>
know what my warm is like.  I definitely know they are not like each
<BR>
other.  My brain merges these sensations into a conscious spirit world
<BR>
of my awareness in which they can be &quot;felt&quot;, compared, and contrasted.
<BR>
Until what others are &quot;feeling&quot; is similarly merged or effed into my
<BR>
conscious mind, and I &quot;feel&quot; the real thing, the best I can know is
<BR>
&quot;abstractly&quot; what the sensations are.  Evolution has merged all my
<BR>
divers phenomenal qualia together so I can compare and contrast and
<BR>
feel them all first hand.  This, to me, is proof that science must be
<BR>
able to continue this process.  When evolution added to the human
<BR>
conscious mind, the ability to feel color for the first time it proved
<BR>
that such was possible.  There is no reason why science can't expand
<BR>
on this process and make us &quot;more aware&quot; of things evolution added to
<BR>
other brains but hasn't yet added to our brain, like &quot;what is it like
<BR>
to be a bat&quot;....  And, like we now continually discover and synthesize
<BR>
new fundamental elements, I'm betting we will likely discover and
<BR>
synthesize new &quot;feelings&quot; or qualia that have not yet been &quot;felt&quot;
<BR>
before.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there more possible color qualia which we could use to
<BR>
represent a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than
<BR>
visible light in our visible consciousness?  I like to hope so.  What
<BR>
could such be like?  The science of giving us such enhanced abilities
<BR>
to &quot;feel&quot; more is what I'm looking for.  (I hope we can do more than
<BR>
just map a color beyond ultraviolet into some color quale I use for
<BR>
some other wavelength and represent it with that.  Something entirely
<BR>
different then the color qualia I already know and use would be much
<BR>
better.)  Just because such things are &quot;subjective&quot; doesn't mean we
<BR>
can't apply all the principles of science to them and do what
<BR>
evolution has already started for us.  Science is not limited to
<BR>
abstract behavior only, it also applies to the phenomenal qualities we
<BR>
experience, if we'd just attempt to apply science to more than just
<BR>
the abstract behavior our senses detect and then abstractly represent
<BR>
with phenomenal qualia.  Just because our abstract senses can't &quot;eff&quot;
<BR>
doesn't mean our mind cann't be expanded, via science, to be able to
<BR>
&quot;eff&quot; and include other sensations.
