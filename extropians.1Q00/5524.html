I really thought Mission to Mars was grossly over-rated.  It got 2 out of 5
<BR>
stars in one review at IMDB.  Regardless, if I see one more sci-fi flick
<BR>
where there are lines like &quot;i'm sorry Jim, but I won't be coming back with
<BR>
you this time...&quot; or where they play silly mind-games with themselves......
<BR>
<P>The acting was really inhuman.  That is to say, I don't know any humans that
<BR>
are like that.  And the plot itself... the way each character had their own
<BR>
&quot;thing&quot;... it didn't leave much to the imagination as to how it would end.
<BR>
Blah blah, this guy would get to go home and read to his kid again, blah
<BR>
blah, this guy lost his wife so he'll be zooming off with aliens instead of
<BR>
coming home.  I couldn't get emotionally attached at all.  It was
<BR>
ridiculous.
<BR>
<P>Although I must say I'm definitely biased.  The day before I saw Mission to
<BR>
Mars I'd seen The Ninth Gate.  Now THERE'S a movie!  Cinematic, wonderful
<BR>
plot - with just a hint of mystery here and there.... In a nutshell,
<BR>
Polanski took a few staples of Hollywood (fast cars, tits-and-ass, fire and
<BR>
satan) and made a wonderful-looking trailer to draw people in... but then
<BR>
engaged them in a wonderful movie.  Johnny Depp's main character was someone
<BR>
human.  Someone I could get emotionally attached to, and even identify with.
<BR>
Suffice it to say, I had to go see the Ninth Gate again the day after I'd
<BR>
seen Mission to Mars... kind of rebooting my etch-a-sketch cinema memory...
<BR>
<P>-c.

<EM>&gt; I think Kubrick was the best director who ever lived, I wish 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he'd made it. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know he worked on AI for well over 15 years but somehow it never got 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finished, all sorts of rumors why.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was shocked to hear he had died and very sad that he never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got to film 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _AI_ which will not be the same in Spielburg's hands, though 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he may do an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excellent job, we will see.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recently saw, _Mission to Mars_ which was good but not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great.  I could not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help but compare the ending of it with the final scenes of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _2001_ which was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infinitely better.  I noticed how in some ways they attempted to copy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kubrick's masterpiece but were hopelessly inadequate in doing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so.  The way 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kubrick shifted the pov and used lighting and set design was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sheer genius in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing Bowman's lifecycle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SPOILER!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was touched when the Martian in _Mission to Mars_ showed a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holographic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; image of a young Mars being hit by a comet and the planet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being plunged into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chaos.  As time passed the Martians sent out ships to find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new homes in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; galaxy.  But somehow the story, writing, alien fx and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characterization and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; film direction were just not up to the task of achieving the level of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotional power needed to do the film right.  The cast was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top-notch (except 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the Sliders' guy! lol) and so that was not the problem.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought Brian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DePalma would have been up to the task, oh well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sincerely,
