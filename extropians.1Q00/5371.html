<EM>&gt; &gt; You are not actually claiming that non-US citizens are more informed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US foreign policy than Americans, are you?  If you are, I must beg to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; differ.  Freedom of the press is one of our most cherished rights, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; press is not shy in the least about putting Government policy (foreign 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; otherwise) in a less than flattering light.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This statement is good for the high school civics class, but the real world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is different.  Yes, the US has freedom of expression almost unprecedented
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elsewhere -- except when it comes to pornography or funding political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;campaigns.:)  But Americans generally don't see the effect of US foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policy and the things they do see from the major news organizations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;including NPR and PBS, are usually tailored for specific responses.  Sadly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most TV and radio new programs and newspapers in the US, tend to accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;State Department's press releases as news items and the final word on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subject.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Witness how little Media criticism there was of the Persian Gulf War, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continued bombing of Iraq, and the recent NATO attack on Serbia.  In fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aside from some of the libertarian print Media (e.g., _Liberty_, which is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinion magazine NOT a news journal), which is so small it's almost a joke,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the only major new outlet that had a critical line toward the latter two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happenings (the bombings of Iraq and Serbia) was WBAI, which is extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marginal.  Even NPR and PBS -- which are, sad to say, the best of the breed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of mainstream news -- either ignored (in the case of Iraq) or cheerleaded 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(in the case of Serbia) the attacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to be of the opinion that where there is a lack of criticism, there 
<BR>
is a lack of objective journalism.  The fact of the matter is that the 
<BR>
majority of Americans (if not the majority of the global population) were 
<BR>
not very critical of these interventions.  In fact, without international 
<BR>
approval none of those actions would likely have been taken.  There was in 
<BR>
fact detailed coverage of each of these occurrences and there was a good 
<BR>
deal of public discourse about the propriety of US action.  I tend to think 
<BR>
that the absence of widespread criticism results more from widespread 
<BR>
approval of the policies than from the media acting as propaganda tools for 
<BR>
the US government.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This is called foreign policy.  It's using your clout (political,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;economic, or military) to induce your neighbors to act in your best 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*Every* nation does it (or tries, or wants to do it).  But since the US 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;most clout it is usually the most successful at having other nations 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with its wishes.  Again, like it or no, this simply is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree that it's natural to use foreign policy tools to &quot;induce your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neighbors to act in your best interest.&quot;  This is the way of the world and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't think our discussion is going to change that.  However, what is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the &quot;best interest&quot; of any nation is usually NOT that nation's best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest, but the interest of whatever small group has the reigns of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foreign policy power at that time.  Thus, we see, the recent bombings of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sudan and Afghanistan -- to get some exiled Saudi terrorist -- were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uncannily done when the President was down in the polls.  I don't think it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was in the interest of the American people to bomb those places.  It,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;however, did appear to be in the interest of one man who had some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;popularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems at the time.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, and those concerns were much discussed in the press at the time.  The 
<BR>
fact of the matter is that some things are the President's call to make.  
<BR>
You can't simply fire him just because he takes action which is politically 
<BR>
expedient for him.  Of course if it rises to the level of high crimes and 
<BR>
misdemeanors, you can impeach him.  But as recent experience teaches, 
<BR>
impeachment is not always an easy thing to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would go further to say that it is also NOT in the best interest of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nation to promote the use of force, which is 90% of the US foreign policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tool kit, to settle disputes.  That's a very short range policy.  It only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;works as long as one is powerful enough to enforce one's views on everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else.  The lesson it teaches one's neighbors is &quot;might makes right.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to disagree.  It seems to me that the US resorts to military action 
<BR>
only as a last resort, when all other efforts have clearly failed.  A great 
<BR>
deal of US foreign policy centers on building international consensus to 
<BR>
isolate a &quot;rogue&quot; state, and attempting to impose political and economic 
<BR>
sanctions on those states.  And further I can't think of a *single* instance 
<BR>
in recent history when US military action was used for any purpose other 
<BR>
than in response to military action which had been initiated by someone 
<BR>
else.  I would hardly describe such a policy as &quot;promoting&quot; the use of 
<BR>
force.  Would you have the US stand by debating the issue at the UN while 
<BR>
Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation?  Or while Serbia exterminated the 
<BR>
Albanian population in Kosovo?  Like it or not, there *are* situations which 
<BR>
justify the use of US force in situations which do not directly threaten US 
<BR>
security.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
