<EM>&gt; a) What is the photonic density required to create a black hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and do any of the principles of photon interaction prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    this from focusing laser beams to produce a black hole? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    [I may have asked this before, but I'm too lazy to go check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     the archives.]
</EM><BR>
<P>In our previous discussion, I think I found some references from
<BR>
sci.physics which indicated that no intensity of photons would create
<BR>
a black hole, if they are all going in the same direction.  The answer
<BR>
was complicated for other cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; b) If you have particles (electrons, protons, etc.) circulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in a syncrotron, emitting syncrotron radiation, shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    they eventually &quot;evaporate&quot; into nothing?  Or is it always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    true that the photons they are emitting get replenished by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the external power source?
</EM><BR>
<P>An electron won't evaporate.  The radiation it emits must be coming from
<BR>
the EM fields accelerating in the synchrotron.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; c) Why do astronomers, esp. X-ray astronomers, often quote the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    temperatures of gas clouds in &quot;millions&quot; of degrees?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    atom/molecule densities are on the order of a few per cc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    I don't see how you can get temperatures like this.  Temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    corresponds to vibration or molecule velocity, but what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the relationship between ionization state and temperature?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Is the effect of increasing temperature -- atom ionization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    then acceleration of the ions?  If so, then what would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the &quot;temperature&quot; of an electron gas?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure about what this actually means, but presumably there are
<BR>
two choices.  (1) the gas cloud is emitting black body radiation and
<BR>
really has a temperature of millions of degrees.  (2) the gas cloud is
<BR>
emitting non-thermal radiation of some sort, whose peak is in the range
<BR>
that would correspond to a black body temperature of millions of degrees.
<BR>
<P>There is nothing in principle preventing (1) from being true, but it
<BR>
is hard to see what energy source could get it so hot, since the Sun is
<BR>
only a few thousand degrees.  Perhaps some kind of magnetic interaction
<BR>
could super-heat the cloud.
<BR>
<P>I would assume the temperature of an electron gas, or a plasma, could be
<BR>
defined based on the kinetic energies of the particles just like for a
<BR>
conventional gas.
