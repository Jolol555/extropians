<EM>&gt;&gt;  I favor keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; proven intimidating abusers, and the mentally incompetent and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; deranged, and ONLY them.  I have no problem whatsoever with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBLE gun ownership by the general citizenry (I own five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; of them).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So then WHAT is this persistent debate about, anyway? What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person with normal awareness of public safety requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and of the incidence of human injury and death by means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;firearms could object on rational grounds to the following?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1] Convicted hyperaggressive felons should be denied legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    ownership of any lethal weapon, even if the enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of the law has intractable practical limitations.*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2] Spousal or child abusers who have either been convicted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of aggravated assault, assault with intent, etc. or known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    by the Child Protective or Welfare Agencies locally to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    violent by history should be likewise denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3] Anyone denied a license to operate a motor vehicle, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    whatever reason, should automatically be denied owner-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    ship of firearms. This would include alcoholic drivers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    habitual  offenders and those who have thereby shown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a heedless and reckless disregard of the welfare, safety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and security of the general public.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4] All individuals known to the local judicial system as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    certifiably sociopathic or ambulatory psychotic should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;5] Hunters who have violated local laws pertaining to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    use of firearms for this purpose or otherwise engaged in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    illegal hunting practices should be denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;6] ANYONE known by properly constituted authority to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    legally irresponsible in the use of firearms for ANY purpose,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    including collecting, selling, trading or the mechanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    alteration of firearms should be denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;7] The retailing of firearms should be limited to, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    exception, state-owned stores, just as in some states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    liquor sales are currently regulated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;8] ALL firearms owned by private individuals should be com-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    prehensively registered with an appropriate local law-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    enforcement agency. Private trading should be banned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;9] Penalties for first time and repeated offenders should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    equal to or greater in severity than those that currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    apply to violators of motor vehicle laws. A point system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    or other device could be used to determine when a license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    must be suspended.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;10] First time gun owners should be tested by written and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     optical exams just as motor vehicle owners are now. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     would not be required to be relicensed unless a violation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     of firearms laws, statutes and ordinances was a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     court record. (See -8- and -9-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I cannot stress enough the revulsion I feel toward those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reject such rational social controls on the ostensible basis of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some abstract idealist polity or manifesto using ad populum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terms like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; to induce emotional support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for irresponsible firearm ownership among those who are either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;socially incompetent, illiterate or simply too immature to under-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stand the implications of such terms when applied to the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is truly astonishing that, after the perhaps 2,500-year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;documentation of the human tendency to inflict violence on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his own kind to achieve merely selfish ends, we still listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who advocate that some personal acquisitive desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be regarded as superordinate to the welfare of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;community upon which this individual depends. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of privilege is forfeit by those whose very polemics are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grounded in social indifference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;* This caveat applies to every stipulation; arguments against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the regulation and control of the use, distribution, and owner-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ship of firearms based on the difficulties inherent in applying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laws and regulations are entirely specious. This argument is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reduced to absurdity by demonstrating that, for the same reason,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NO laws or regulations should be enacted within a community in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behalf of the general welfare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
A lucid and cogent statement.
