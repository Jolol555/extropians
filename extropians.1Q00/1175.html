<P>
Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Have fun! This might add some rigor to the discussion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for your link but my problem is not just population increase and
<BR>
environmental crisis. I think that the present human species' members are
<BR>
evil, destructive, stupid and selfish creatures (and I'm not claiming myself
<BR>
as an exception). However, I think that there has been a major evolution
<BR>
from an intellectual and cultural point of view in the human masses of
<BR>
civilized countries in the past centuries that presently continues and,
<BR>
hopefully, will continue. And that is why I don't think it's good for the
<BR>
species to freeze our society in the present time by ending aging tomorrow.
<BR>
So, I believe that the best for the species as a whole would be to have germ
<BR>
GE and other technological improvements to the human species before we
<BR>
endure in eradicating aging -- of course that this goes against my personal
<BR>
ambitions and that is why I would be delighted if a cure for aging was
<BR>
discovered tomorrow. 
<BR>
<P>Now, answering GBurch:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Humans, their technology and their effect on their environment are &quot;natural&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because consciousness and its products developed as part of the spontaneous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;order of the terran biosphere. Thus the concept of a &quot;natural&quot; environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distinct from humanity (or posthumanity), per se, is untenable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have one word for you: demagogy. I believe it's because of writing things
<BR>
like this that, as you wrote, 'there is apparently a common caricature of
<BR>
extropians as &quot;selfish, greedy despoilers of the environment&quot;'. 
<BR>
<P>Look, I'm not an environmentalist. My views are basically the same as the
<BR>
ones Robert expressed in his response to me (although, and as I mentioned,
<BR>
our &quot;thresdhold&quot; views might diverge). But I do think the extropian
<BR>
philosophy is a anti-environmentalist. It's the old American view of
<BR>
free-market and anarcho-capitalism -- bound to generate huge wealth but also
<BR>
enormous social problems (as the US have) and ecological disruption (as the
<BR>
US have and are causing on other countries such as Nigeria, Angola, the
<BR>
Middle East, Indonesia, etc.).
<BR>
<P>Goodbye.
