<P><EM>&gt;This was mentioned and discussed here a couple of &gt;months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As I recall, not even the author (a college kid writing it &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impress his tree-hugger professor) took it seriously.
</EM><BR>
<P>I might have missed that. I recall a discussion from a few months back which
<BR>
I think was about a different page (and fitting your description) but I
<BR>
could be mistaken.
<BR>
<P>It seems that what worries many is the prospect of a fraction of humankind
<BR>
blazing ahead and transforming themselves into a posthumans, while others
<BR>
are left behind. I can understand the fear of being left behind or becoming
<BR>
a second-rate being. With our present psychology, relative loss of position
<BR>
and status, even when accompanied by an absolute gain in ability and wealth,
<BR>
is not often not welcome. No amount of bananas can compensate for becoming
<BR>
the laughing stock of the tribe.
<BR>
<P>&quot;But we can offer to reengineer you psychologically, so that you become
<BR>
perfectly happy about the prospect of living in the shadows of the
<BR>
posthumans! Or we can offer a VR world where you can enjoy the fantasy of
<BR>
being God Almighty Himself!&quot; And this shows that those would accept
<BR>
technology could be happy. But (1) is doesn't help those who reject
<BR>
technology, and (2) people might have other preferences in addition to being
<BR>
happy.
<BR>
<P>One might consider, however, that very few people today are not &quot;living in
<BR>
the shadow&quot; of somebody else. There is only one Clinton and one Gates, but
<BR>
there are billions who have a boss or a dominating parent or husband.
<BR>
Intellectually there is also always someone who is better, except for very
<BR>
few in a very narrowly defined area of expertise; similarly for athletic
<BR>
ability or anything else. It seems that to enjoy the respect of those around
<BR>
one is enough for most of us, or at any rate the most one can hope for. So
<BR>
loss of absolute status of unaugmented humans due to the rise of posthumans
<BR>
should not be such a major concern.
<BR>
<P>Maybe the real problem is fear of being treated badly by the posthumans.
<BR>
Since most transhumanists do not claim to know how posthumans will behave,
<BR>
there seems to be no way of dismissing this possibility. It is a legitimate
<BR>
worry.
