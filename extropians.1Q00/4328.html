The best way to deal with the problem, I think, is to freely release 
<BR>
verifyable forms of the tech so that, say, if I tried to manufacture anthrax 
<BR>
my nano-device would immediately report me to the authorities. But as long 
<BR>
as I limit my creations to food, diamonds, computer parts, etc. I'll have no 
<BR>
problem with the feds.  Otherwise, I'll try to get an unregistered version 
<BR>
from the Cult of the Dead Cow and then...look out!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>A very bright but criminally minded individual or group might be able to 
<BR>
hack into the safeguards so they could create whatever they pleased, 
<BR>
including antrax.  Even the best defenses can be overcome by those with the 
<BR>
brains, education, time and money.
<BR>
<P>I could really see the federal government feeling that near-anything boxes 
<BR>
in homes would be somewhat like letting citizens have their own personal 
<BR>
nukes.  Once there is even one major incident/scare the gov't would move in 
<BR>
a way that would make the gun control issue look minor by comparison.
<BR>
<P>In the name of public safety and national security, we may never be allowed 
<BR>
these replicators within our homes in the first place.  The gov't and 
<BR>
corporate powers may say, &quot;come to us, and for a &quot;nominal&quot; charge we will 
<BR>
create what you want.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Underground groups would have massive federal resources allocated against 
<BR>
them, to put them behind bars.  The hacker hunts would pale by comparison.  
<BR>
Nano would be used to violate civil liberties that would be reminiscient of 
<BR>
the war on drugs but more clandestine and for that reason even more 
<BR>
threatening to people's rights.
<BR>
<P>My hope is that home nanoreplicator technology will develop very 
<BR>
incrementally and we will see it gain a foothold in the private citizen's 
<BR>
realm that will not be possible to reverse.  May corporate greed and the 
<BR>
forces of capitalism triumph in this area!  So we will see a nanoreplicator 
<BR>
and then eventually a near-anything box in every home! LOL!  With 
<BR>
capitalistic inducements, proper safeguards and no individual or group 
<BR>
overcoming them to do something really vicious as an excuse for the gov't, 
<BR>
we may see our dreams come true.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
