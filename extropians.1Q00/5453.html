<P>How about this:
<BR>
<P>If the Waco recreation shows that FLIR pickup of infrared output from gun
<BR>
muzzles is evidence of those guns' firing, which FLIR experts have
<BR>
previoulsy said it is, then government officials have lied to the public
<BR>
regarding aspects of the death of more than four-score men, women, and
<BR>
children who were citizens.
<BR>
<P>If these citizens under siege were shot and killed by other citizens
<BR>
under government orders as they attempted to escape the burning building,
<BR>
which was ignited somehow, then the first group of citizens are dead, and
<BR>
the second group murderers.
<BR>
<P>If government officials have been alleged to have lied, then they have
<BR>
been alleged to have broken the law, and should be arraigned.
<BR>
<P>It is plain enough that any officials that can be expected to have made
<BR>
decisions resulting in the untried death penalty of these citizens should
<BR>
receive the same punishment, but this is not a fundamentalist Islamic
<BR>
country so instead they should be reprimanded, fired, and put in jail,
<BR>
those being government officials that ordered murder or tacitly allowed
<BR>
it, and at least the titular head of the irresponsible agency or
<BR>
agencies.
<BR>
<P>It kind of has some things to do with freedom of information act.
<BR>
Perhaps we should have a separate government agency hold in escrow
<BR>
volatile government agency transcripts, to protect the agency and us as
<BR>
citizens.
<BR>
<P>I have been doing some small reading of freedom of information act
<BR>
information as I want the one form where I can order from all agencies at
<BR>
once or to pick and choose from a list of all agencies that store
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P>Well, the Mt. Carmel near Waco incident was more than five years ago,
<BR>
those people are dead forever.  They died under government siege.  It's
<BR>
none of my business beyond citizenry membership and thus dislike of
<BR>
government sieges, it's for the courts to establish precedence of
<BR>
bringing criminal charges against the irresponsible members of the ATF
<BR>
and FBI and other related agencies.
<BR>
<P>Now, as this is a free country and innocence is presupposed, I do want to
<BR>
make it clear that I see the need for a trial of those circumstances.
