<P>
<EM>&gt; Thanks to those who have make suggestions, on- or off-line! For curious,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the draft for the polemics piece is included below. I'm especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grateful to Greg Burch, who made some excellent editorial changes to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earlier version.

The Case Against Aging
<BR>
<P>Life is good. Far more often than not, death comes too early, with pain and
<BR>
loss for the one who dies and those who are left behind.  Every human being
<BR>
alive - or who has ever lived - knows that these statements are true.  And
<BR>
yet, they have been the inescapable ground of human life since its
<BR>
inception.  We have all asked &quot;Can't we make more of what is good in life,
<BR>
and make it last?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Well, what if we could?
<BR>
<P>More and more researchers now agree that radical human life extension is
<BR>
only a matter of time. Abolishing aging and disease is theoretically
<BR>
possible. It is a goal that is not quite within reach yet, but will soon be.
<BR>
<P>The question is, will it arrive in time? Or will you perish on the threshold
<BR>
of the era of much longer and healthier human life?
<BR>
<P>Human life expectancy has been increasing slowly but surely over the past
<BR>
hundred years. Extrapolating this relatively slow progress would be a
<BR>
mistake. In the last few years we have begun to catch glimpses of the
<BR>
biochemical processes underlying aging. Researchers are currently developing
<BR>
tools that will give us unprecedented control over basic biological
<BR>
processes on the cellular and genetic levels. These tools point to the
<BR>
realistic hope of greatly extended and much more healthy human life spans.
<BR>
<P>Scientists have already extended life span in other species: in mice by over
<BR>
30%. By changing just two genes, scientists have enabled nematode worms to
<BR>
live up to six times their normal life span.
<BR>
<P>Preventing aging in humans is complicated, yet several promising research
<BR>
avenues are currently being pursued. These include
<BR>
<P>*	Stem cells. In November last year, human stem cells - cells which
<BR>
can be made to grow into any other type of cell - were detected and
<BR>
cultivated for the first time. This opens enormous possibilities for
<BR>
regenerative medicine. New nerve cells can be grown and used to treat
<BR>
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, or aging related dementia. Failing organs such
<BR>
as hearts and kidneys may be replaced by organs grown outside the body from
<BR>
the patient's own stem cells.
<BR>
<P>*	Telomerase. Individual cells can be &quot;immortalized&quot; by replenishing
<BR>
their telomeres (small DNA caps that sits at the end of the chromosomes).
<BR>
This removes the limit to how many times a cell can be made to divide, and
<BR>
therefore, how long it will live.
<BR>
<P>*	Gene therapy. Somatic gene therapy will insert beneficial genes in
<BR>
the cells of adults, not only curing many hereditary diseases but also
<BR>
potentially offsetting the changes that occur with aging. 
<BR>
<P>*	Nanomedicine. When mature molecular nanotechnology is developed,
<BR>
maybe 20 years from now, it will be possible to manufacture and program
<BR>
small molecular machines that can enter individual cells and repair damage
<BR>
to DNA and other structures. Nanomedicine will eventually give us much
<BR>
greater control over the biochemical processes in our bodies.
<BR>
<P>Life extension and at some point the abolition of aging will have great
<BR>
consequences for society. The traditional &quot;linear life&quot; paradigm in which
<BR>
people migrate through education, then work, then leisure/retirement, may be
<BR>
replaced by a &quot;cyclic life&quot; paradigm, in which education, work and leisure
<BR>
are interspersed repeatedly through the life span. It will become normal for
<BR>
50-year olds to go back to school and for 70-year-olds to start new careers.
<BR>
<P>Life-extension will not place a burden on health care, because it should
<BR>
increase people's health span, not just add some extra years in a care home
<BR>
in a state of dementia. When 80-year olds have the same physique and mental
<BR>
agility as people in their forties, they will be among the most economically
<BR>
productive members of society.
<BR>
<P>Some people might say, &quot;Wouldn't it be boring to live forever?&quot; But would it
<BR>
be more exciting to be dead? Indefinite life span - just like the lives we
<BR>
have now -  will be as boring or as exciting as we make them.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Overpopulation needs to be avoided. However, in technologically advanced
<BR>
societies, couples tend to have fewer children - below the replacement rate.
<BR>
By spreading the benefits of technology, education, and women's rights to
<BR>
countries that are currently poor, fertility rates will decline there too.
<BR>
People choose to have smaller families and to have children later in life.
<BR>
<P>If one took seriously the idea of limiting life span to control population,
<BR>
why not be more active about it? Why not encourage suicide? Why not execute
<BR>
anyone reaching the age of 75? - That is clearly absurd. Instead, if it were
<BR>
necessary, a better way of limiting population growth is by limiting the
<BR>
rate of new births. And in the long run, our successors will learn to use
<BR>
the infinite resources in the universe outside our planet.
<BR>
<P>To stay alive is a basic human drive. It is a precondition for all other
<BR>
activities. Life-extension is natural progression of medicine from curing
<BR>
diseases and the effects of aging to preventing them altogether. It follows
<BR>
the dictum laid down by many religions: that human life is sacred and should
<BR>
be cherished and preserved.
<BR>
<P>Let's not be in the last generation to die of old age! We can improve our
<BR>
odds by demanding adequate funding for anti-aging research (which is
<BR>
currently pitifully underfunded). On an individual level, we may adopt a
<BR>
healthier life style and keep our fingers crossed. Some foresightful persons
<BR>
may consider a cryonics contract as a last resort. If your body is frozen in
<BR>
liquid nitrogen after you are declared legally dead, it can be preserved
<BR>
indefinitely without further tissue degradation. At some point in the
<BR>
future, medical science may progress to the point where it becomes possible
<BR>
to reverse the freezing damage and the original cause of death. Too many
<BR>
times in the past have people declared something technologically absolutely
<BR>
impossible - only to see it done a few years later. Indeed, many leading
<BR>
experts on nanotechnology anticipate that it will make it possible reanimate
<BR>
cryonics patients. Of course there is no guarantee. But being cryogenically
<BR>
suspended is the second worst thing that can happen to you!
