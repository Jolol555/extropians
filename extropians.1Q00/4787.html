<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;FBI Database of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995.
</EM><BR>
<P>[Note *1995*....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even remotely close to &quot;undeniable.&quot;  Sure everyone knows that crime has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been steadily decreasing recently.  *Nothing* I have ever seen attributes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this trend to the large number of guns circulating in society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe it was mentioned on the list a month or two ago (perhaps
<BR>
before Mike returned), but not particularly well discussed, that the
<BR>
current working academic theory (albeit a very controversial one),
<BR>
circa *1999*, is that the decline in &quot;crime&quot; in recent years correlates
<BR>
strongly with the legalization of abortion.  Fewer unwanted children --&gt;
<BR>
fewer criminals, nothing to do with guns at all, entirely a sociological
<BR>
phenomena.
<BR>
<P>Now, just to balance the discussion, I've seen &quot;statements&quot; to the
<BR>
effect, that the rash of youth violence in recent times is not a change
<BR>
in the actual incidence but a change in the reporting by news hungry
<BR>
sensationalistic media.  Where adultery and children running amok
<BR>
were once &quot;private&quot; issues, they have now become fodder for public
<BR>
voyerism.
<BR>
<P>I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
<BR>
irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
<BR>
that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
<BR>
If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
<BR>
engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
<BR>
in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this premise, the
<BR>
efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of Congress) to try
<BR>
and enact laws that can keep people from suing the gun manufacturers
<BR>
are highly misguided.  [I might be willing to grandfather certain very
<BR>
old weapons, but modern day products should be engineered to be safe.]
