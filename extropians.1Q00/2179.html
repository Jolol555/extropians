<P>I suppose you could call this a variant of the Frank &amp; Knight concept
<BR>
of &quot;ballistic&quot; atomic cooling, from their Foresight Conf. 1997 paper.
<BR>
See: <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Abstracts/Frakabst.html">http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Abstracts/Frakabst.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>Their concept of &quot;atomic&quot; cooling, seems to provide the highest
<BR>
cooling capacity possible.  Higher even than Eric's phase change
<BR>
coolant from nanosystems.  The problem is they leave out all
<BR>
of the &quot;important&quot; details of how you would actually implement
<BR>
such a system.
<BR>
<P>The problem ultimately comes down to how to &quot;transfer&quot; the heat from
<BR>
the JB to the coolant &quot;fluid&quot;.  If the materials don't come into contact,
<BR>
the only way to do it is radiation and that is somewhat inefficient.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But, anyway, it seemed beautifully elegant to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I'll agree with the elegance.  Its one approach to cooling JBs,
<BR>
a subject that needs much more work.  But you still have a lot of extra
<BR>
material left over in the solar system and you haven't &quot;optimized&quot;
<BR>
the energy usage of the sun.  Another topic would be an exploration
<BR>
of whether there is enough non-solar C in the solar system to construct
<BR>
even a single Earth sized diamondoid-JB.  I would guess the answer
<BR>
is yes, but then you have all that extra energy going to waste.
<BR>
The only logical thing to do is setup lots of breeder reactors
<BR>
to manufacture more C to build more JBs.  The question then becomes
<BR>
how long it takes to convert all the non-solar H/He/O/Fe, etc.
<BR>
into C, after which you have to start star-lifting activities?
<BR>
<P>I believe someone asked about the URL's related to these concepts.
