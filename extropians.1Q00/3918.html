John,
<BR>
<P>Yes I do have a lot of catching up to do. Let's see 450 email messages...hmmm
<BR>
let me see here...hmmm it says half are from you! ;)p LOL Well not really but
<BR>
man you are the busiest beaver on the Extrop list. How are you doing? I was
<BR>
getting around to sending you an individual message about being back but things
<BR>
happened and you beat me to it.
<BR>
<P>I am feeling well and there isn't much pain. I was sooo tired before the
<BR>
surgery. I have my days and nights turned around so the last time I slept was
<BR>
the morning till the afternoon of Wednesday. That night I was awake as usual and
<BR>
unable t get to sleep anyway and trying to get messages out and read. Then
<BR>
Thursday I couldn't sleep during the day because I had to go to the hospital for
<BR>
pre-op check in and testing. Back home again I still couldn't sleep and had last
<BR>
minute messages to go out. I stayed awake for the surgery and only had a spinal
<BR>
block and local anesthesia. After it was done around 11 am I went to my room and
<BR>
began to eat (hadn't eaten since 12 am the night before--the rules--got only two
<BR>
bites of a sandwich) when they whisked me away to radiation therapy to irradiate
<BR>
the knee to discourage re-growth of the errant bone material. Back to the room I
<BR>
finally eat and wouldn't you know it I got my second, hmmm maybe third by now,
<BR>
wind! Later at 8 pm there was a movie with Extropian leanings I tried to watch
<BR>
but by then I was finally too tired to put up with it's lame plot and backyard
<BR>
acting.
<BR>
<P>I wish there was a way to winnow some of the chaff from the list mailings. Such
<BR>
as not in the area of extropianism or those less than 10 word responses an
<BR>
especially short stinging quips. How do you filter that stuff...you can't. Oh
<BR>
well....450 emails yet to go through. :(
<BR>
<P>Hey how are you doing lately? Have you heard from your Aussie friend? Are the
<BR>
new meds working? Maybe so based on the level of your activity. You know as I
<BR>
read your posts I even more so find it difficult to convince myself of your
<BR>
disability in learning. Wish there was a way for you to earn a living
<BR>
commentating. Well back to the grind. ;)
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>James
