<P><EM>&gt; Several people have written back with the notion that the 3rd World is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  full of potential.  I agree - lots and lots of potential, most of the 
</EM><BR>
world'
<BR>
<EM>&gt; s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  population, resources, fascinating cultures, and (often) no lack of drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  on the part of the people.  Anyone who's travelled in the &quot;developing&quot; 
</EM><BR>
world
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  has seen this: marketplaces and traffic and microbusinesses everywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Huge potential - and yet rarely does anything of consequence.  Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  There's no single answer - resources, education, lots of things have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mentioned.   However, there's one thing that's a constant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries: terrible, terrible, short-sighted, 
</EM><BR>
kleptocratic,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  nepotistic, dictatorial &gt;government&lt;.   The education that's supposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  come from giving whizzy slate computers to the people, or the rise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  property values that might otherwise come from buying up seemingly valuable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rights-of-way in places like Lagos, can't happen if the leaders of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  countries won't allow you to do it - or worse, will be happy to see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  investment, and then will confiscate it - either overtly, or over time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  through punitive taxation, extortion, and all the usual 3rd World means.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you 100%  I've also traveled in the 3rd World and without a 
<BR>
doubt the governments are the single greatest impediment to development.  But 
<BR>
these governments didn't happen by accident and the current crop of tin-pot 
<BR>
dictators and crony kleptocrats aren't isolated examples in history - they're 
<BR>
the norm in &quot;modern&quot; times throughout the developing world.  Any attempt to 
<BR>
deal with the problem that ignores the historical and cultural milieu that 
<BR>
gives rise to this nearly universal phenomena (and doesn't learn from the few 
<BR>
notable exceptions) is doomed to failure.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  So - how about the Revolution Foundation?  A well-funded group develops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  both a business plan - and an invasion plan - for a target country.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ineffective leadership is forced out in one way or another.  The group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  comes in with sufficient resources (mostly trained staff, this isn't to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be another throw-money-away venture) to build up needed institutions -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  courts, schools, etc.  Our favorite sort of minimal-interference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  market-respecting government is instituted.  It doesn't have to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  democratic, day one likely it can't be.  &gt;Now&lt; buy the land. Sit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  back and wait.
</EM><BR>
<P>An interesting proposal and one with resonance to ideas that have been 
<BR>
percolating in my mind over the last decade or so.  See below.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  How much could it cost to take over, say, Zaire/Congo, anyway?
</EM><BR>
<P>A LOT.  Consider the now pandemic partisan warfare throughout equatorial 
<BR>
Africa that has created a host of armed groups there and the history of 
<BR>
non-native insurgent movements in other Third World locales, for instance the 
<BR>
dismal fate of the Walker invasion of Nicaragua in 1856 and the 1981 
<BR>
Seychelles coup, just to name a couple.  Frankly I think it would require 
<BR>
hundreds of millions of dollars at least and a highly trained military force 
<BR>
of at least thousands of people - and even then would have a low chance of 
<BR>
success.
<BR>
<P>But the idea of attacking the structural corruption of Third World 
<BR>
governments has a lot of merit.  The idea you describe above sounds somewhat 
<BR>
like the best of British commercial &quot;imperialism&quot; in the 18th through the 
<BR>
20th Centuries.  An example that comes to mind is the way in which the UK 
<BR>
took over the running of China's postal and customs systems after the Second 
<BR>
Opium War.  I know I saw a post about privatizing and international or 
<BR>
transnational &quot;outsourcing&quot; of governmental services here recently (sorry - 
<BR>
can't find it).
<BR>
<P>I can see an object of long-term development investment being the creation of 
<BR>
a transnational civic education and service organization, the goal of which 
<BR>
would be to develop honest and transparent institutions.  Some of this effort 
<BR>
would literally be the creation and maintenance of efficient and open 
<BR>
institutions.  Complementary to this would be an educational institution for 
<BR>
training people in the basics of civic life: Entrepreneurial and management 
<BR>
skills, legal knowledge and the values of an open society.
<BR>
<P>This is done on a very distributed and ad hoc basis now.  Government &quot;aid&quot; 
<BR>
(the failures of which we've been discussing elsewhere) and education of some 
<BR>
people in Western universities happens now.  The innovation would be an 
<BR>
explicit connection between the two and an open avowal of the superiority of 
<BR>
values of individual liberty, transparency and legality.  Especially the 
<BR>
latter would require courage in the face of post-modernist relativism that 
<BR>
dominates so much of academia and the press now.
