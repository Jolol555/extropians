<EM>&gt; Best I can recall that has happened before..  If it can be cloned I'm all for

<P>They have mammoths falling out of glaciers/permafrost relatively frequently
<BR>
in Siberia.  Just have to be in the right place at the right time to catch
<BR>
one before it spoils.  However, if Robert F.'s calculations are correct
<BR>
regarding DNA preservation, you can't go back much further than recent
<BR>
ice ages and expect to get functional DNA unless you intend a Celera
<BR>
like effort to sequence *lots* of little fragments and reconstruct the
<BR>
entire genome.  Its not strictly impossible, its just going to take more
<BR>
work and funds than are available in most labs currently.
