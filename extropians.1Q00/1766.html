<P>
<EM>&gt; It caught [Amara Graps'] eye because I _did_ have a pretty bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influenza...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; P.S. The &quot;solar&quot; theory below, I just don't buy. My understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of radiation pressure forces in the interplanetary space and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planetary magnetospheres is the material would be forced outward.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore, this theory linking to heavier solar activity would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that the radiation pressure forces would blow the dust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outwards _more_ from the Solar System....
</EM><BR>
<P>Im with Higson, [very unlikely], however the actual mechanism would
<BR>
not be increased radiation pressure from the sun blowing space dust
<BR>
toward the earth.  What they must have had in mind was the current
<BR>
peak of the ~11 year solar cycle expands the upper atmosphere [a lot]
<BR>
and so the widely scattered interplanetary dust would be more likely to
<BR>
be captured by our atmosphere.  The actual total radiation from the sun
<BR>
does not vary that much over the 11 year cycle, [so the dust wouldn't
<BR>
notice]
<BR>
but the radiation in the 10.7 cm band does increase a lot during a solar
<BR>
peak
<BR>
and that wavelength is especially good at heating and expanding the upper
<BR>
atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting that the flu pandemic of 1915-1918 [that killed two of
<BR>
my great great grandparents] spans a solar max, however I looked up
<BR>
and found it was not a particularly high one. See
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.sunspotcycle.com/se/14feb98/isksun/">http://www.sunspotcycle.com/se/14feb98/isksun/</A>
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, it is quite easy to establish contagion links from person
<BR>
to person when the flu is going around.  The flu of 15-18 could be
<BR>
explained by more people trotting all over the globe to fight the great
<BR>
war, for instance.  spike
