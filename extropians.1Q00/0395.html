<EM>&gt; &gt; Most are innocuous, like the FM transmitters and the generic video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the disguised cameras are most likely to be used for home security (one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; testimonial mentions a smoke alarm video set up to monitor the front porch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for grandma, another was used to find a person putting threatening notes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; into a schoolgirl's locker); and the only items really close to bending the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law are the downconverters and 800 MHz receivers which could be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; listen in on cell phone calls.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They were charged with wiretapping.  I don't think the cameras were at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue.  The equipment to listen in on cell phone calls is at issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so- *all* the equipment on that list was seized.  The 800 MHZ receivers
<BR>
are possibly in violation of that one specific FCC regulation promulgated
<BR>
to protect unencrypted analog cellphone service.  The other devices were
<BR>
seized under the very nebulous terms of 18/2512, which repeatedly speaks of
<BR>
&quot;knowing or having reason to know that the design of such device renders it
<BR>
primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire,
<BR>
oral, or electronic communications&quot;, rather than any overt criminal act. 
<BR>
Pardon me, that sounds like thoughtcrime to me.  Low power FM transmitter
<BR>
microphones are, I presume, interpreted as being for the purpose of
<BR>
&quot;surreptitious interception of... oral... communications&quot;.  This would make
<BR>
a Furby in a paper bag illegal!  (And Furbys _are_ seen as threats, banned
<BR>
from CIA and NSA workspaces.)
<BR>
<P>However, 18/2512 also exempts &quot;a provider of wire or electronic
<BR>
communication service&quot; or &quot;an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person
<BR>
under contract with, the United States, a State, or a political subdivision
<BR>
thereof&quot; and allows them and their agents &quot;to send through the mail, send
<BR>
or carry in interstate or foreign commerce, or manufacture, assemble,
<BR>
possess, or sell any electronic, mechanical, or other device knowing or
<BR>
having reason to know that the design of such device renders it primarily
<BR>
useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or
<BR>
electronic communications.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>This smacks of medieval guilds- only members and the king's agents are
<BR>
privy to the guild's secrets... and exempt from the restrictions placed on
<BR>
the hoi polloi.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is a reason that the original report cited here comes from the 2600
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hacker's website.  It is a little late to deny the hacker connection now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after the hackers have worked so hard to defend one of their favorite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vendors.
</EM><BR>
<P>So if _any_ customers use a product for illicit purposes, the vendor is
<BR>
liable?  Man, I hope Radio Shack, Digikey, and Mouser have some good
<BR>
lawyers.  Hell, I've worked professionally with video cameras and FM
<BR>
transmitters for _entirely legal_ aerospace research projects, using
<BR>
vendors like Ramsey simply because they were economical.  Does that make me
<BR>
a hacker?
<BR>
<P>Guilds and thoughtcrime.  Oh brave new world.
