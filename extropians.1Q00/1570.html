<P>We Are Not Alone - Or Are We? 
<BR>
The annals of science fiction are filled with advanced extraterrestrial 
<BR>
creatures like Klingons and Wookies, Vogons and Romulans, all carrying on in 
<BR>
a human sort of way. And while screenwriters and novelists weave stories 
<BR>
around these characters, some people scour the heavens for signs that such 
<BR>
highly evolved beings really are out there. 
<BR>
But a new book by two University of Washington scientists contends that, 
<BR>
contrary to popular thought, we just might be alone and Earth might be 
<BR>
unique, if not in the universe at least in this celestial neighborhood. 
<BR>
<P>In &quot;Rare Earth,&quot; published this month by Copernicus Books/Springer, 
<BR>
paleontologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald Brownlee examine the 
<BR>
remarkable confluence of conditions and events that deposited life-forming 
<BR>
chemicals on Earth, allowed simple life to gain a foothold and then protected 
<BR>
the planet sufficiently and created just the right environmental factors for 
<BR>
advanced life to slowly evolve. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It seems like something a lot of people don't want to hear, yet nearly 
<BR>
everyone who works in these areas has remarked at one time or another how 
<BR>
unusual the Earth is,&quot; said Brownlee, an expert on comets, the space bodies 
<BR>
that might have delivered the first organic chemicals and life-sustaining 
<BR>
water to Earth. 
<BR>
<P>In fact, he and Ward, whose extensive research on the fossil record has 
<BR>
provided key insights into prehistoric mass extinctions, frequently discuss 
<BR>
the Earth's unusual character with students in their astronomy and geological 
<BR>
sciences classes. 
<BR>
<P>The scientists don't argue that life is rare. In fact, recent evidence 
<BR>
showing simple microbial life can survive extreme conditions on Earth is an 
<BR>
indicator that such life also might be widespread in the galaxy and the 
<BR>
universe. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;But you need to have a vast amount of time to let evolution ramp up to 
<BR>
animals, and we think there are only a small number of planets where that 
<BR>
could happen,&quot; said Ward. 
<BR>
<P>The key, he said, is having near equilibrium in such things as temperature 
<BR>
and water content over enormous time spans. 
<BR>
<P>Microbes have shown they can live in some of the harshest Earth environments 
<BR>
imaginable, while advanced plant and animal life requires a delicate balance 
<BR>
of conditions. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;For 90 percent of the age of this planet, life was slime at the bottom of 
<BR>
the ocean,&quot; Brownlee said. But that life was given a one-in-a-million 
<BR>
opportunity to gradually evolve to the complexity it enjoys today. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The underlying theme of the book is that the Earth is a very charmed 
<BR>
planet,&quot; he said. &quot;We know of no other body that is even remotely like 
<BR>
Earth.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Factors that made advanced life possible include the Earth's having: 
<BR>
<P>* The proper distance from the sun to allow development of habitat for 
<BR>
complex life and ensure that water remains liquid, not vapor or ice. 
<BR>
<P>* The proper mass to retain atmosphere and ocean. 
<BR>
<P>* Plate tectonics, which act as a sort of atmospheric thermostat, build land 
<BR>
masses and enhance biotic diversity. 
<BR>
<P>* A neighbor the size of Jupiter, not too close and not too far away, that 
<BR>
can use its gravity to protect the planet from too many life-extinguishing 
<BR>
collisions with comets and asteroids. 
<BR>
<P>* A stable orbit unperturbed by giant planets. 
<BR>
<P>* A large moon at the right distance to stabilize tilt, thus ensuring 
<BR>
seasonal climate fluctuations that are not too severe. 
<BR>
<P>* Enough carbon to support development of life but not so much to allow for 
<BR>
runaway greenhouse conditions. 
<BR>
<P>In addition, Brownlee and Ward contend, the solar system's position in the 
<BR>
Milky Way galaxy also is key to life development on Earth. At the edge of the 
<BR>
galaxy, many stars are too metal-poor for planet formation, while the center 
<BR>
of the galaxy has extreme energy processes that would hinder complex life. 
<BR>
<P>The &quot;charmed&quot; conditions on Earth won't always be present. Someday, some way, 
<BR>
evolution on Earth will end. That could be when the sun gets so hot that life 
<BR>
can no longer survive, when ultimately the ocean boils and surface rocks 
<BR>
melt. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;There will be a time when there will be no record of life ever having 
<BR>
existed on Earth,&quot; Brownlee said. 
<BR>
<P>He and Ward acknowledge that their assumptions about how uncommon advanced 
<BR>
life might be in the universe are based on observed conditions that allowed 
<BR>
evolution on Earth. But this is the only place in which advanced life is 
<BR>
known to have occurred, and it is one of only a handful of places in the 
<BR>
solar system where even microbial life is suspected, making this planet the 
<BR>
ultimate laboratory on advanced life. 
<BR>
<P>A key condition for life on Earth is the presence of carbon, because of its 
<BR>
unique properties. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Probably all life is based on carbon,&quot; Brownlee said. While he concedes the 
<BR>
possibility that life has evolved elsewhere based on an element such as 
<BR>
silicon, he remains skeptical of that theory. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Many things are possible. You can never imagine everything the universe can 
<BR>
do. But we know it didn't happen here,&quot; Brownlee said. &quot;If things have to 
<BR>
obey physical and chemical laws, then there really aren't a lot of options in 
<BR>
nature.&quot;
