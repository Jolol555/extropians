<P>Sure it does.
<BR>
<P>I was more boisterous and silly in some of my Usenet posts before the
<BR>
advent of Dejanews.
<BR>
<P>I still agree with the things I wrote those years ago. In looking back
<BR>
at my posts from 5+ years ago, it also seemed to me that I was smarter
<BR>
back then, until I realized that I had alot more time to think about
<BR>
the topic and I usually put a huge amount of effort into my posts,
<BR>
which I don't do now.
<BR>
<P>I never flamed anyone so I don't regret my posts.
<BR>
<P>Many years ago, I had the weird expeience of being flamed on a Usenet
<BR>
group by an Apple vice-president. Half a day later he had removed his
<BR>
very emotional post (I could see a &quot;Cancel&quot; message for it in nn), and
<BR>
he had replaced his message with one that was much tamer.  However, he
<BR>
had edited it in such a way that there were large gaps in the logic
<BR>
flow of the text, so one knew that there was something missing.
<BR>
<P>That simple &quot;Cancel-and-replace&quot; told me far more about him than
<BR>
anything that he had written in his message.
