<P>I'd be interested in seeing a citation or web site for that statement.
<BR>
But, if it's true I can venture a couple of reasons.
<BR>
<P>1. Parents deal with their children constantly. This results in a
<BR>
deep(er) understanding of how best to relate new material to their child
<BR>
for learning. If not explicitly, then perhaps intuitively.
<BR>
<P>2. Individualized attention. Another strong predictor of high grades and
<BR>
scoring well on standardized tests is class size. The smaller the number
<BR>
of students one has to teach, the more time spent with any one
<BR>
individual student. Amount of time spent with a learner is a very strong
<BR>
factor that soaks up a tremendous amount of variance in the distribution
<BR>
of test scores. One of the arguments used against gifted programs that
<BR>
generate better students is that it is merely a function of the small
<BR>
class size on not the particulars taught.
<BR>
<P>3. It may be that parents teaching their children use methods that
<BR>
worked for them when they were younger or when they attempt to learn
<BR>
something new in general. It's possible that enough neurological
<BR>
overlaps exists between child and parent that these learning methods are
<BR>
better for the learning child's neurological architecture.
<BR>
<P>4. In general, apprenticeship-type programs are largely successful.
<BR>
<P>5. Parents who home school are much different than average parents in my
<BR>
book. Their motivation and willingness to take something like this on is
<BR>
probably indicative of a number of traits that will produce well scoring
<BR>
children.
