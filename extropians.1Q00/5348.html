<P>
<EM>&gt; Many comments, Octavio. I would prefer to see what others have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say before respond.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too, I am interested in receiving input from both us and non
<BR>
us citizens, and compare the differences of opinion
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But you have said precisely what everyone abroad who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually EXPERIENCED the effect of Corporate Imperialism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [we euphemistically refer to it the was you did, as &quot;American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interests&quot; a P.R. triumph for corporate America] will say if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they feel they can speak candidly.
</EM><BR>
<P>And yes here we feel the effects of corporate capitalism a lot.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to greedy corporations and a corrupt government our country.
<BR>
That has an ample territory, endless natural resources, and a key
<BR>
position, we are the bridge between north and latin america and now
<BR>
we are also the bridge between Europe, Asia and the usa, and 
<BR>
our country and economy has been modernizing at a giant step, however
<BR>
our economy hasn't fulfilled it's potencial yet, because nobody cares
<BR>
about the needs or desires of our population, everybody just wants to 
<BR>
get rich quick, and they manipulate our economy to fill their needs
<BR>
and U.S. Corporate world plays a big role on this.
<BR>
<P>For example, now they say that with maquiladoras, they are creating
<BR>
jobs in our country and although it is true, a worker here earns a
<BR>
lot less than what it's American equivalent and people stills 
<BR>
want to enter to the usa illegally, but most illegal just find
<BR>
that the American dream is about being hidden the entire day
<BR>
to avoid getting caught, to suffer the abuses of border patrol
<BR>
officers, and several other things, however corporations wouldn't
<BR>
dare to raise the wages in Mexico to be more competitive.
<BR>
<P>And I'm sure that all the talk about how the ilegal immigrants just
<BR>
live from welfare, or don't pay taxes has more political/economical
<BR>
interests than concerns about them. Specially when you want to sell
<BR>
at competitive prices and you want to pay low wages, we now have a
<BR>
NAFTA, but a lot of Mexican products are still banned
<BR>
in the U.S. Due to several interests, and with the most ludicrous
<BR>
excuses, they are a lot less restrictive with our products in Europe
<BR>
and European countries are usually more conservative in the 
<BR>
restrictions
<BR>
they place to foreign products. 
<BR>
<P>Now they made piracy a serious crime, and the penalties are getting
<BR>
tougher, and while is true that piracy here runs rampant, it also
<BR>
does in the U.S. (and everybody who been in #warez or downloaded
<BR>
a crack knows) but corporations insist we are the bad guys who
<BR>
steal intelectual property, however nobody mentions we don't have
<BR>
the same percapita income of the U.S. Or western European nations.
<BR>
<P>And well speaking of the drug issue, it is true the mafias are
<BR>
operating in our country, but they were created and protected
<BR>
by our governments, most of the production is intended for the
<BR>
American market, and obviously it is a big money generator
<BR>
so legalization is out of the question. Besides it is a very
<BR>
useful tool to sanction us economically or to mention us when
<BR>
people in the united states complain about real problems. And
<BR>
yet most candidates and notably the main opposition candidate
<BR>
who likes to mention extropic values. And how is he going to
<BR>
modernize our country, said the other week that drugs are
<BR>
the cancer of our society, they turn normal people into
<BR>
criminals, and the usual antidrug propaganda people likes to
<BR>
use, however they never mention that a lot of substances
<BR>
are less harmful for your health than alcohol or tobacco, and
<BR>
how wiser countries like Germany, Holland, Switzerland or Australia 
<BR>
are beginning to relax their drug laws.
<BR>
<P>Well I could rant on eternally and if we mention other countries
<BR>
this post would be longer than the whole anti gun vs pro gun debate
<BR>
so I hope this brief mention of a person that since has born has
<BR>
seen and been a victim of this kind of manipulation, will inform 
<BR>
those who can help us the most, the American citizen that begins
<BR>
to notice it's government is doing everybody more good than bad
<BR>
with it's oppression to other less powerful countries, and that
<BR>
maybe
<BR>
<P>those crazy, hippies/libertarians/extropians/communists/insert
<BR>
your name here have more reason than what they thought.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><EM>&gt; Your post is precisely what is MOST needed for the education
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of naive American public opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; May I congratulate you for your honesty?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Best wishes,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bob
