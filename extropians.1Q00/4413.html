THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, 
<BR>
has been shown to be a neuroprotective antioxidant:

Now a study suggests it may also kill brain tumors:

<P>Marijuana ingredient kills rat brain tumors
<BR>
Not known whether approach would work in people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Feb. 28 -- Marijuana-like drugs
<BR>
eradicated some brain cancers in rats
<BR>
and helped other animals live longer,
<BR>
possibly hinting at a new approach for
<BR>
treating the disease, researchers say.
<BR>
But brain cancer experts said they
<BR>
aren’t impressed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE STUDY dealt with gliomas, the
<BR>
most common category of cancer arising in
<BR>
the brain. Gliomas are highly lethal in people
<BR>
despite treatment with drugs, surgery and
<BR>
radiation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rat study was published in the March
<BR>
issue of the journal Nature Medicine. It was
<BR>
conducted by scientists at the Complutense
<BR>
and Autonoma universities in Madrid, Spain.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marijuana, or cannabis, is best known
<BR>
for its ability to give people a &quot;high,&quot; but the
<BR>
plant also has medicinal properties, such as
<BR>
relieving pain and nausea.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
STUDY DETAILS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers injected glioma cells
<BR>
into the brains of rats to produce tumors.
<BR>
Untreated rats died within 18 days.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other rats were treated with drug
<BR>
infusions for seven days through a tube
<BR>
leading to the tumor. Fifteen rats got infusions
<BR>
of THC, the main active component in
<BR>
marijuana. Tumors disappeared in three
<BR>
animals, and nine other rats outlived the
<BR>
untreated ones, surviving up to 35 days.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When researchers used a different but
<BR>
similar drug, five of 15 rats became
<BR>
tumor-free and four others outlived untreated
<BR>
animals, the researchers said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists said they did not know if
<BR>
the cancer treatment was appropriate for
<BR>
humans, but they planned further studies.
<BR>
Cancer treatments that work in animals may
<BR>
be too toxic or not effective in humans.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemicals activated two receptors,
<BR>
or chemical doorways to cells, which
<BR>
prompted an increase in a lipid known as
<BR>
ceramide. The researchers theorized that
<BR>
ceramide in turn activated a chain of protein
<BR>
reactions that killed the cancerous cells.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the researchers, Dr. Manuel
<BR>
Guzman, said in an interview he hoped to
<BR>
start human tests in about a year. &quot;We are
<BR>
quite happy with (the findings), and we
<BR>
believe we can at least try and see what
<BR>
happens in humans,&quot; Guzman said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Daniele Piomelli of the University of
<BR>
California at Irvine wrote in separate article
<BR>
the rat findings were encouraging, given the
<BR>
bleak scenario for treating malignant gliomas.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients usually receive surgery,
<BR>
radiation and chemotherapy, but median
<BR>
survival is 40 to 50 weeks.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Although incomplete, these findings
<BR>
must be seriously considered,&quot; Piomelli
<BR>
wrote.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
MUCH MORE RESEARCH NEEDED 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dr. Philip Gutin, chief of
<BR>
neurosurgery at the Memorial
<BR>
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York,
<BR>
said other experimental therapies work better
<BR>
in rats. And the paper doesn’t demonstrate
<BR>
that the effect came from the drugs rather than
<BR>
simply the infusion of liquid into the brain, he
<BR>
said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Rolf Barth, who studies brain tumors
<BR>
at Ohio State University, called the work
<BR>
interesting. But he said the type of glioma
<BR>
cells used to create the tumors does not
<BR>
provide a very good mimic of the human
<BR>
disease.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
