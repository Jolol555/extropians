<EM>&gt;Then do you not oppose the Brancn Davidians for firing first? We all saw

it. I'm

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: There's no evidence that the Davidians fired 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first. There's nothing to which you could refer by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying &quot;we all saw it.&quot; Carol Moore, a Waco research 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and author, sums up this matter as such: &quot;Evidence 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided during the trial did not answer definitively 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the question of who shot first or where in the front 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the building.&quot; She also cites this important fact:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;Entry team member [ATF] agent Rolland Ballesteros, the 
<BR>
&nbsp;first to arrive at the front door, gave trial testimony 
<BR>
&nbsp;different from his statements to Texas Rangers and Waco 
<BR>
&nbsp;police right after the raid.  He told Rangers that he
<BR>
&nbsp;thought agents shooting at the Davidians' dogs fired the 
<BR>
&nbsp;first shot.  At trial he changed his story and testified 
<BR>
&nbsp;that the Davidians shot first through the front door, 
<BR>
&nbsp;'ambushing&quot; them.'&quot; <A HREF="http://kreative.net/carolmoore/TDM-04.html">http://kreative.net/carolmoore/TDM-04.html</A> 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two metal double front doors that could 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have answered the &quot;fired first&quot; question disappeared 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the fire. A Texas State Trooper testified that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he saw what may have been that door being taken away 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shortly after the fire. He also said that he overhead 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FBI agents talking about a gunfight in the rear of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Center (exactly as the FLIR video indicates).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: <A HREF="http://newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/3/10/52116">http://newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/3/10/52116</A> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is not in dispute is that David Koresh, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unarmed, opened the front door and ended up getting 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shot in the hand and side there, at the front door. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, on its face this strongly suggests 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he was shot as he opened the door, unarmed, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus that they opened fire on him. How does 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it fit into the Davidians &quot;ambushing&quot; the ATF 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by having their leader walk up to them unarmed?
