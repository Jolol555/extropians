<EM>&gt; &gt; In this day where almost every citizen has a large and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rapidly growing stock portfolio, and the ability to purchase huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; amounts of computing power...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Do you really think that is true, even in America (let alone the developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world)? The _minority_ of citizens have a stock portfolio, and the minority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the ability to purchase huge amounts of computing power. No doubt the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demographic on this list is different, but don't extrapolate it to 'every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen', without first calling in at your local benefits agency, charitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hospital, shelter for the homeless, etc. and asking the people there whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they prefer PC or Macs, or how their bonds are performing.
</EM><BR>
<P>They own it whether they know it or not. Most all corporate, non-profit, union, and
<BR>
government retirement programs are heavily vested in stocks, as are all insurance
<BR>
companies (which people are vested in). Direct stock ownership occurs in about 30-35%
<BR>
of the population, a higher rate than at any time in our history, but indirect occurs
<BR>
with anyone who has a job that has benefits.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; ...every individual is going to have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ability to do and get almost anything they want, completely ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any central government elite or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         As above: no, they're not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But there is no logical reason why any advanced, able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; become anything he wanted being would even want to do such absurd and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; irrational kinds of &quot;bad&quot; things...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Since people of this type do not necessarily act on 'logical reason' when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they carry out atrocities today, the lack of a 'logical reason' in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future will not stop them continuing to carry them out.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since increased artificial mind augmentation will add increased logical abilities to
<BR>
the average person, then the amount of illogical reasoning will by definition
<BR>
decline...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now that we've finally achieved the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to grow intentionally and intelligently, rather than via unintelligent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; survival of the fittest random mutations, there is no reason to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; selfish, domineering, or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Yes, there is. Technology is not cost-free, and resources are not (yet)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unlimited. Nor are intention and intelligence guarantees of agreement. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not sure what the reaction to GM foods in the US has been like, but in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UK it serves to illustrate that technological advancement is far from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controversy-free, and thus necessitates a degree of selfishness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domination on behalf of both its 'pros' and its 'antis'.
</EM><BR>
<P>So long as productivity growth and resource availability increase faster than
<BR>
population growth, then we remain on the track toward relatively unlimited resources.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;       Once we (machines included) can really feel whatever we want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to feel, and not what our creator hard wired us to want to feel, we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all really want to wire these feelings to do only good things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         (A personified creator?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nature.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         Why will we want to wire feelings to do only good things? Or, perhaps, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will we _all_ want to do that? If someone has a rabid desire for power,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domination and territory, and sees technology as a way to achieve those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aims, why would that individual choose to remove those feelings, rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carpe his diem? And who will decide which things are 'good' and which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'bad'?
</EM><BR>
<P>The market will decide what is good and what is bad. Individuals, as they gain more
<BR>
logical, computational abilities, will understand more and more that power domination
<BR>
strategies are not beneficial to one's true self interest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cold hard logic will dictate that all of our ancestors that died
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before making it to this future glorious immortal heaven are our real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creators and the ones that gave us this glorious gift for free.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are the ones that really deserve it... &lt;snip&gt;... The only way to really do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; according to cold hard logic, is to find some way to resurrect every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; last one of our ancestors, to completely achieve a perfect history...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         And so welcome back to Stalin, Hitler, Jack the Ripper, Vlad the Impaler...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whom cold, hard logic dictate to be a few of our glorious creators.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or Mother Theresa, St. Francis of Assisi, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham
<BR>
Lincoln, Winston Churchill (I'd love to have a drink and a cigar with that guy), Teddy
<BR>
Roosevelt, etc. However much nature rather than nurture decides one's greatness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I make it to that future time, I will always feel lonely without, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; indebted to all of my ancestors which are my real creators.  To think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that a more intelligent being than myself will have less of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; desires, especially logical machines, seems to me to be completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; absurd, illogical, and irrational.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Oh, I don't know. Perhaps 'guilt' and 'loneliness' will be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negative, 'bad', emotions, and someone will have decided to wire them out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as you suggested.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who thinks that eliminating emotions is a good thing has some issues to work
<BR>
out. Being transhuman does not mean less human, it means more human, better human. I
<BR>
don't see how you can acheive this by subtraction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;       We are about to overcome the evil of all future death and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suffering.  That's the easy part.  But, there will still be people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that are still dead, the only real &quot;evil&quot; that will remain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         We are not about to overcome all future suffering, and the removal of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death, and resurrection of the dead, will not end all evil.
</EM><BR>
<P>If our projections of the future are reasonably accurate, most people alive today under
<BR>
the age of 35 will most likely only die from accident, suicide, warfare, crime, or
<BR>
stupidity, in that order. I estimate that this means about a 90% decrease in the
<BR>
fatality rate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         So, in summary. At some point in the future, the dead will be resurrected,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and will join the living. A judgement will be passed to decide what is good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and bad, and the bad things will be removed. Then everyone will live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heaven where everyone is happy and there is no suffering. I can't help but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find this has a familiar ring to it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody who is not frozen can truly be resurrected, unless you develop time travel and
<BR>
go back in time to do brain scans of every person who ever lived before they died.
<BR>
Spider Robinson has written some novels based on this premise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But things that are good have an obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advantage over all that is bad, namely, that which is &quot;Good&quot;, is by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; definition, that which everything and everyone one wants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         There are very few things indeed which &quot;everything and everyone wants&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore, almost nothing is good. As an example, in talking to people, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find that many are happy to die, and consider it unnatural and undesirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to live forever. The problem in your definition is made evident, as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue:
</EM><BR>
<P>Many, but not all people, are happy to die. Many, but not all people are not happy with
<BR>
their lives... see a resemblance? However, there are things that all sane people do
<BR>
agree on. Those things can be defined as 'good'. Also, due to evolutionary fitness,
<BR>
there are things which are more good or more bad than others.
