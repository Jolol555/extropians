Natasha Vita-More &lt;<A HREF="mailto:natasha@natasha.cc?Subject=Re:%20Where%20is%20art?%20(Was%20Re:%20Predictions%20by%20Kurzweil)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002281723.KAA00446@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">natasha@natasha.cc</A>&gt; pointed out:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is what the visual artist &quot;creates&quot; with color that awakens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artistic brain power rather than the ability to distinguish a wave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; length of the visible spectrum.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely.  It is my feeling that you are talking about
<BR>
the many complex, intelligent, and &quot;artistic&quot; things the brain does
<BR>
with the phenomenal way it represents information.  Computers have
<BR>
many complicated &quot;algorithms&quot;, &quot;data-buses&quot;, &quot;registers&quot;, and so on
<BR>
and so forth that give them whatever &quot;intelligence&quot; they have.  But at
<BR>
the lowest level, computers represent information with abstract
<BR>
&quot;bits&quot;.  It doesn't matter what physical phenomenon is doing the
<BR>
representing of a computer's bits, whether it be a paper tape,
<BR>
magnetic tape, a biasing voltage across a transistor, voltage on a
<BR>
bus line...  or whatever.  As long as such is properly &quot;mapped&quot; to be
<BR>
what that physical property is meant to represent.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this fundamental level I'm talking about, not the
<BR>
complex algorithms, architectures, intelligence and sophisticated art
<BR>
work the machines are doing which I think you are referring to.  I'm
<BR>
concerned with the physical (and most importantly the phenomenal)
<BR>
nature of the base or fundamental level representations.  For a
<BR>
computer, the lowest level is the bit and it doesn't matter, really
<BR>
what it is.  But for us, it is the phenomenal qualia, and I think it
<BR>
does matter what it is.  Sure, when an artist is composing a &quot;score&quot;
<BR>
she is taking all these phenomenal lowest level representations and
<BR>
composing them into glorious, sophisticated, non trivial,
<BR>
emotional... &quot;symphonies&quot;, the algorithms, registers, data-buses.., of
<BR>
our mind all based at the fundamental level on phenomenal qualia.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think any complex enough abstract model (i.e. a long enough
<BR>
piece of punched paper tape.) can represent any such &quot;symphony&quot;.  It
<BR>
can adequately &quot;describe&quot; any &quot;feelings&quot; it evokes in us.  But, no
<BR>
matter how accurately the paper tape abstractly &quot;represents&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;models&quot; this information it still isn't fundamentally &quot;like&quot; the
<BR>
representations our brain uses to represent real art right?  It is
<BR>
just a set of wholes in paper that must be &quot;mapped&quot; to what our
<BR>
phenomenal representations really are right?  One is truly art, the
<BR>
other, though potentially completely precise, is just a non phenomenal
<BR>
or abstract description of art right?  One doesn't matter what it is
<BR>
fundamentally like since we always &quot;map&quot; it into something else while
<BR>
with true art, I think it most definitely does matter what it is
<BR>
fundamentally &quot;like&quot;.  One is a &quot;map&quot; or &quot;model&quot;, or &quot;simulation&quot; of
<BR>
art, the other is fundamentally the real thing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painted picture, like all things beyond our senses, is just
<BR>
an abstract computational description that enables our senses to &quot;map&quot;
<BR>
this abstract information it merely represents into the real
<BR>
phenomenal, emotional... thing, or what the artiest intended on
<BR>
&quot;creating&quot; or &quot;invoking&quot; or &quot;awakening&quot; in the perceiver.  It doesn't
<BR>
matter if it is oil based, reproduced on an advanced CRT or 3D display
<BR>
device, or even if we don't have a retina and the identical neural
<BR>
data is being fed directly to our optic nerve from some precise
<BR>
virtual reality representation...  The important thing is the final
<BR>
results.  That's why I don't think you can really call what is beyond
<BR>
our senses, or the medium, the real art.  It's simply something that
<BR>
doesn't really matter what it is.  I think all real art is in our
<BR>
brain and it does matter what it fundamentally is.  It seems to me
<BR>
that everything beyond our senses is just a &quot;mapped&quot; representation of
<BR>
this real thing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for joining this discussion Natasha, I've always
<BR>
wondered what you, as a technical extropian artist that can understand
<BR>
these kinds of things thought on this subject.  I'm such a non artist,
<BR>
but this seems so fundamentally important to art to me.  What (and
<BR>
where?) is art really?  Is it the beginning cause of the cause and
<BR>
effect perceptual process (the 'art work'?) or the final results (that
<BR>
which the 'art work' &quot;awakens&quot; in the perceiver)?  Or something else
<BR>
entirely that perhaps doesn't really exist or doesn't matter what it
<BR>
is fundamentally based on or what it is phenomenally like?...
<BR>
