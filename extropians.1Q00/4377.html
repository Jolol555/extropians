You don't pay taxes if you sell personal stuff, right?
<BR>
And if you are a merchant, you may not be satisfied with
<BR>
multiple exchange items - you'd like to pay off the costs
<BR>
and make some profit.
<BR>
<P>I am quite familiar with multiple barter exchanges from
<BR>
Russia - it was typical for apartment exchanges.
<BR>
I was working on a program for automatic finding
<BR>
of multiple simultaneous matches - a closed subnetwork
<BR>
of wants and needs in the barter system.
<BR>
Lots of problems with simultaneous transactions.
<BR>
Should be easier with software and member reputations.
<BR>
In any case, it looks at the very least like a useful
<BR>
social experiment.
<BR>
<P>This can also help cross geographical boundaries, with what
<BR>
I'd call &quot;correlated transactions&quot;.  Also, from my previous
<BR>
experience:  People R1, R2 live in one country; people A1, A2
<BR>
live in another.  R1 wants to send money across the border
<BR>
to A1, and A2 wants to send the same sum to R2.  Borders
<BR>
are guarded and taxed.  The solution:  A2 gives money to A1;
<BR>
R1 - to R2.  No values crossing borders - just signals;
<BR>
no tax on those.  This &quot;value tunnelling&quot; could probably
<BR>
be taken further.
<BR>
<P>If the system is run as a business, how will it make money?
<BR>
<P>Want to make a business case?
