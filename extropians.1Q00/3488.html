<EM>&gt; &gt; Take, for example, Star Trek style transporter rays. You take me apart,

<EM>&gt; &gt; an atom at a time, throw the remnants away and reconstruct a copy at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distance. In at least an intuitive sense, the copy 'isn't me.' You've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; murdered me, albeit in a peculiarly baroque way. The fact that there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone else walking around who thinks he's me is, from my oblivious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perspective, neither here nor there. I'm dead - just as dead as if you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shot me or cut off my head. For the copy, of course, the experience is of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; course one of displacement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You said that there's another way of looking at it but how is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different than my description?
</EM><BR>
<P>The difference is that I don't think this is an extraordinary situation:
<BR>
The copy is to the original as I am to myself a moment ago. There's no
<BR>
difference between the ordinary passage of time and StarTrek beams,
<BR>
uploads, radical reconstruction of frozen mush-brains, etc. In every Zen
<BR>
'now,' we are the copy - convinced we are somehow the 'same' person who
<BR>
existed a second ago. 
<BR>
<P>Here's an analogy to the way I see everyday, ordinary existence:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You experience now.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You vaporize.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I build a copy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to step one. 
<BR>
<P>You're always the poor dumb schmuck thinks he's the real thing, with no
<BR>
possible experiment showing otherwise, then disappearing. Always stepping
<BR>
out of the transport beam, overjoyed to still be alive, then disappearing
<BR>
as another you pops up elsewhere. There's a chain of individuals:
<BR>
each fooled into believing he's all the one's who've passed before him.
<BR>
This is what I mean when I say 'consciousness' is instantaneous. You're a
<BR>
sequence of instances, still frames, with the happenstance of memory the
<BR>
only connection between them. This is why death doesn't matter - you've
<BR>
already died an infinite number of times. You're being uploaded a trillion
<BR>
times a second.
