<EM>&gt; I love this idea.  I could imagine doing it in the software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; field specifically, because the cost of engineering a piece
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of software with certain functionality goes down with time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as tools and methods improve, the opportunity for adding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; features grows, and it is often cheaper to re-engineer a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piece of software from scratch than to update it--yet many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies persist in updating software for non-technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons to their detriment.  You also have the advantage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not having to support a user base with old hardware, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be cheaper to rewrite equivalent/better functionality
<BR>
from scratch, but it will be very very hard to create a
<BR>
perfect substitute for an existing and very crufty piece 
<BR>
of software and do it well enough to have an impact on
<BR>
the market for the old software and on the valuation of
<BR>
the old software company.  To get people to stop buying
<BR>
the old software and start using yours (even if it is 
<BR>
free) you need to produce software that can deal with
<BR>
the old data formats and any program extensions and
<BR>
related tools seamlessly and not require retraining of
<BR>
users.  Nearly impossible I'd say.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's how I'd do it: find one or more companies who have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large market share for a specialized software application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's horribly overpriced (AutoCAD comes to mind for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason:).  Create a substitute using modern engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; methods.  Make it if not completely compatible at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy to migrate to from the older system (requiring minimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data translation and retraining).  Short the stock, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start selling it for the minimum price necessary to sustain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advertising it.  Short the stock some more, then start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving it away completely.  Invest the money in startup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; user-support businesses that start springing up to support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the free software, then retire.  Simple plan, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly the sort of thing I thought, but for the reasons
<BR>
I mention above and marketing/mindshare hurdles, I think
<BR>
it isn't so simple.  I would give it a shot if I could
<BR>
afford to risk several million dollars.  And I'd pick a
<BR>
target smaller than AutoCAD.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You might not even have to create the software from scratch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Imagine, for example, just cleaning up something like GIMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and porting it to Mac and Windows to undermine Photoshop.
</EM><BR>
<P>GIMP has been ported to Windows.  GIMP is wonderful, but it
<BR>
needs more work before it impacts Adobe's valuation, particularly
<BR>
area of suitability for prepress work.
<BR>
<P>Even if GIMP were better than Photoshop in every way (and
<BR>
it already is in may ways), profiting through options or
<BR>
shorting Adobe stock would be a long term risk/investment.
<BR>
The installed base rules.  In the interim if Adobe is smart
<BR>
it has plenty of opportunity to reinvent itself so that
<BR>
even when Photoshop ceases to be such a dominant platform
<BR>
its valuation will continue to be high.  All considered, the
<BR>
strategy is very risky.
<BR>
<P>However, as I said, if I had enough capital that I could
<BR>
afford to risk, I would attempt this strategy.  I would
<BR>
attack a niche market with few customers who could be
<BR>
evangelized relatively easily and very high priced software.
<BR>
There would be two or three viable public companies in the
<BR>
niche, mitigating the overwhelmingly dominant installed base
<BR>
problem and making it more likely that my activity would
<BR>
damage at least one of the companies' valuations 
<BR>
severely enough that I could profit handsomely.
