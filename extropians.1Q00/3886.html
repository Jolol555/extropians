<EM>&gt;  I was assuming that politicians will be about equally successfull at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subverting the expressed opinions of the voters in either case, and am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worrying about which approach will best insure that the expressed voter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinion correlates well with the voters' values. I think that asking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;voters to track down indicator problems by looking at numeric weights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is likely to introduce errors because many people won't be willing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to translate their values into numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't have in mind voters tracking down indicator problems via weights.
<BR>
<P>I had in mind political entrepreneurs trumpeting supposed conflicts.
<BR>
That is, a group tells the public that given certain facts, the current
<BR>
value function F chooses decision A, while everyone knows that decision B
<BR>
seems right, and a small switch from F to value function G would choose B.
<BR>
Opponents then can try to point out that value function G would also
<BR>
prefer D over C, when everyone knows that C is better, and C is chosen
<BR>
over D by F.  Others might point out that function H chooses both
<BR>
B over A and C over D. And so on.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully it would be easy enough to check what a value function could
<BR>
choose, given certain facts, that groups wouldn't lie about this very much.
<BR>
More problematic is the possibility of &quot;bad cases making bad law&quot;, where
<BR>
groups focus attention on the consequences in very uncommon situations.
<BR>
Hopefully people would be less moved by hypothetical consequences than
<BR>
real ones, but it's hard to be very confident about this overall.
<BR>
<P>I'm tempted to prefer demarchy here.  That is, randomly select citizens
<BR>
for well-paid (two year?) terms in legislatures where all they do is vote
<BR>
on changes to the value function.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'm intrigued by the idea of using random juries to set the value function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But the details bother me.  You want the function that best predicts random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;jury opinions over some distribution of decisions, given some distribution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of the facts of the case.  But who decides the distribution of decisions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would have the voters decide, probably by grouping decisions into a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simple categories (economic, military, abortion/euthanasia/etc).
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you would have to have political entrepreneurs who point out to the
<BR>
public that there are too many of certain kinds of decisions in the official
<BR>
mix.  I think such groups would have more trouble making credible claims
<BR>
about what sorts of different decisions or consequences would follow from
<BR>
having a different mix.  This is because first such a group would have to
<BR>
persuade people to bet on what value function would best account for this
<BR>
new hypothesized mix of decisions.  In contrast, it should be relatively
<BR>
easy to compute the decision consequences of any given status quo function.
<BR>
<P>I also worry about relying too much on decisions in narrow contexts.
<BR>
For example, surveys on how much government should spend on various areas
<BR>
tend to have people always think we should spend more.  It is only when
<BR>
you ask them to allocate a fixed budget that more reasonable choices come
<BR>
out.   I worry that these narrow jury decisions would be too much like
<BR>
should we spend more on X.
