Scientists grow frog eyes and ears, technology that could be used to grow
<BR>
human organs
<BR>
<P>By Eric Prideaux, Associated Press, 1/3/2000 13:16
<BR>
<P>TOKYO (AP) Japanese researchers have grown frog eyes and ears in a lab using
<BR>
the animal's own embryo cells, technology a scientist said Monday could
<BR>
eventually help doctors replace lost or damaged human sensory organs using
<BR>
cells from the patients' bodies.
<BR>
<P>Makoto Asashima, a biologist at prestigious Tokyo University, said the
<BR>
process is an alternative to donor transplants.
<BR>
<P>The team cultivated thousands of embryo cells in a retinoic acid solution
<BR>
for five days to produce the organs, he said.
<BR>
<P>Varying the concentration of the retinoic acid somehow brings forth
<BR>
different genetic instructions in the cells, Asashima said. A lower
<BR>
concentration activates a set of genes producing eyes, while a higher
<BR>
concentration activates genes producing ears.
<BR>
<P>The researchers used embryonic stem cells, the ancestral cells that develop
<BR>
into the tissues and organs in the body.
<BR>
<P>The procedure is different from cloning, in which a single cell from an
<BR>
organism grows into a copy of the original, he said.
<BR>
<P>Asashima said his team is the first to produce the eyes or ears of an animal
<BR>
in a test tube.
<BR>
<P>In a similar, simpler procedure, the researcher said he previously grew frog
<BR>
kidneys and transplanted them into other frogs.
<BR>
<P>The recipient animals lived for more than a month, he said. The team did not
<BR>
test the survival rate of frogs with transplanted natural kidneys, he said.
<BR>
<P>Hideyuki Okano, a professor of neural development at Osaka University's
<BR>
Graduate School of Medicine, said Asashima's work was ''extremely
<BR>
striking.''
<BR>
<P>Okano, who has been following the research, said it could eventually help
<BR>
scientists reduce reliance on donors for rare organs.
<BR>
<P>Scientists are already able to grow human skin from patients' own cells, and
<BR>
such transplants are carried out in the United States, Europe and Japan,
<BR>
Asashima said.
<BR>
<P>Asashima said he plans to submit his findings, which were first reported in
<BR>
Monday's Mainichi newspaper, to one of two Japanese scientific journals,
<BR>
Zoological Science or Developmental Growth and Differentiation.
