<P>
I don't know you personally Spike but the idea of you being smoldering, 
<BR>
overdone toast does bother me! :)  Confidence is good as long as it is 
<BR>
well-placed.  What I like about Mormon theology is that the vast bulk of 
<BR>
humanity will be saved in some level of Heaven rather then many ending up in 
<BR>
a nightmarish Hell with a relative few in Heaven.  And also some will go on 
<BR>
to become divine and create worlds of their own.
<BR>
<P>Of course as a Mormon I am on the very real enemies list of evangelicals.  
<BR>
As I have said before I believe but do not have perfect knowledge and so 
<BR>
cryonics interests me to &quot;see over the horizon&quot; of future events.
<BR>
<P>Evmick brought up a good point that in most religious systems the 
<BR>
nonbelievers are seen as lost and sometimes suspect.  I studied this in my 
<BR>
sociology of religion class.  Of course sociology teaches about the very 
<BR>
human social constructs of religion.  I have been reading an excellent book 
<BR>
right now called &quot;Apocalypses&quot; by Eugen Weber.  It shows how prophetic 
<BR>
interpretations have changed over the centuries.  Of course people judge and 
<BR>
interpret prophetic writings through the lens of the time they come from and 
<BR>
so I do not see this as a disproving of things.  The closer we come to 
<BR>
something the better we can see it.
<BR>
<P>I was fascinated by the thread about Jesus Christ.  I had already read 
<BR>
various views on his historical origins but still found the discussion to be 
<BR>
food for thought.  I believe Christ to have lived and also to have been 
<BR>
divine but can see how people could contend over his origins.  I must do my 
<BR>
own research to see how accurate the posts were of certain people as to the 
<BR>
evidence or lack of regarding him.  I find it very hard to believe that a 
<BR>
person could take the view that Christ never even existed.  From a 
<BR>
legalistic view at least it would seem very definite that he did.
<BR>
<P>Of course prayer is seen by some as a means to learn truth from God 
<BR>
regarding who has the truth or at least to gain strength and direction in 
<BR>
life.  I don't know if anyone here might pray in one form or another.
<BR>
<P>Robert talked about a sub-SI that decides to hit the delete key.  I think 
<BR>
instead it would go to the game editor feature and decide to get really 
<BR>
creative with things!  Time to bring up the major catastrophes menu! :)
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
