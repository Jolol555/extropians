<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe the real problem is with food distribution, rather than

<EM>&gt; &gt; food production.  I have not done the research, but the anecdotal

<EM>&gt;stories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; silos full of grain in the midwestern US being hoarded and going rotten,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather than being efficienly and equitably distributed seem to support 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Having lived near a grain dump, I can attest to the enormous quantities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grain that are dumped every year.  I have no idea what the exact quantity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is but I am pretty sure that the U.S. dumps over a million tons of grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How would you define &quot;efficient and equitable&quot; distribution of the dumped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grain?
</EM><BR>
<P>Efficient and equitable distribution is obviously getting the grain to the 
<BR>
millions of people who are starving.  Granted this is much easier said than 
<BR>
done.  But you'll never convince me that letting it rot and dumping is more 
<BR>
efficient or more equitable than giving it, or selling it at &quot;cost&quot; to those 
<BR>
who most need it.
<BR>
<P>Grain is a true commodity; the reason it is being dumped and left
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to rot is that the markets for selling it are saturated i.e. there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more buyers.  Being an easily renewable resource, it makes far more sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to dump the excess than to further depress the market by selling below
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cost or giving it away.  In other words, meddling in the grain market will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produce a situation that is even worse than exists now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A far better way to solve the hunger problem is to fix the broken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economies of these starving countries (and the governments that created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them) so that they can afford to buy U.S. grain.  This way the buyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would benefit in general and the producers would benefit from an expanded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;market.  While one could argue that a better solution would be to improve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;local agricultural production, I think that in many cases competing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the production efficiency of the U.S. agricultural industry simply to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have local production is a futile effort and not a useful application of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resources in the long run.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I agree that the bulk of the problem with hunger in the 3rd world is the 
<BR>
lousy governance going on over there.  But how would it hurt the grain 
<BR>
market here to give the grain to countries that can't afford to buy it?  
<BR>
Seems to me such a program might even be good for the US grain market in the 
<BR>
long term.  Because if you give them a freebie while they're down on their 
<BR>
luck, by the time they are ready to buy they may be likely to by from us 
<BR>
rather than Europe, no?
