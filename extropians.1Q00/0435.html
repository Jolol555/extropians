<P>
I've just (re)discovered audio books..
<BR>
<P>I tried it several years ago but there were few if any titles that I 
<BR>
liked....things are somewhat different now .  Today I  listened to Tom 
<BR>
Clancy's &quot;Every man A Tiger' from Oklahoma city to Effingham Illinois....it 
<BR>
was the easiest St. Louis Transistion I ever made..
<BR>
<P>It also confirmed several thoughts I've had concerning our glorious leaders 
<BR>
vis a vis vietnam..
<BR>
<P>It also brings to mind a thought.
<BR>
<P>Hows about some enterprising software type writing a program that would turn 
<BR>
a paperback book into a CD audio?
<BR>
<P>possible steps.....
<BR>
<P>Feeding one page ata time into a scanner.....
<BR>
<P>OCR software translates to ASCII
<BR>
<P>ASCII to voice translates to sound...
<BR>
<P>Possible &quot;tweeks&quot;.......
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple voices...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound effects...
<BR>
<P>The end results are there now....for example....listen to Dune: House 
<BR>
Atreides.....( the various &quot;voices&quot; are kinda weak...being done by only one 
<BR>
guy...but the thought is there)
<BR>
<P>Actually...I think I'd rather listen to a really good SF book 
<BR>
(unabridged...but with appropriate sound effects) than watch some jerk make 
<BR>
has out of it as a movie....(StarShip Troopers....which I refuse to 
<BR>
see...from what i've heard and the reviews I've read it's a sin and a shame 
<BR>
what was done to it..)
<BR>
<P><P>I'm just a shade too young to remember old time radio..(.but I might just get 
<BR>
a few cd's of that too)   but from what i understand it was quiet 
<BR>
entertaining...
<BR>
<P>Just leave out the mind numbing commercials..
