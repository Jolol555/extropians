</EM><BR>
<P>I apologize for going off topic, but I’ve been chewing on this comment since
<BR>
I read it yesterday.  I have always believed (at least on a balance of
<BR>
probabilities, and acknowledging the limits of my personal scope of
<BR>
reference) in the existence of an entity, or entities, force or intelligence
<BR>
that was responsible for design, and occasional personal intervention in
<BR>
individual lives, mine included.
<BR>
<P>Lurking around Extropians is proving challenging to my way of thinking, and
<BR>
irresistibly fun.  I was already in trouble with the “Designer” model.
<BR>
There seems to be too much chaos to conclude that everything is being run
<BR>
smoothly by some benevolent Designer.  At the same time, there is, IMHO, too
<BR>
much that works, in spite of the chaos, to completely exclude intelligent
<BR>
design.  Besides, given the vastness of the universe, and potential
<BR>
multi-verses, and hyperspace (M. Kaku, et al), it seems likely that
<BR>
somewhere there exists intelligence greater than that of Marylyn Von Savant,
<BR>
or whatever her name is.
<BR>
<P>The Christian explanation for such disasters as earth-asteroid collisions,
<BR>
if they would acknowledge such events, would be to explain that when Adam
<BR>
sinned (Eve’s didn’t count, I guess) the World became Satan’s domain.
<BR>
Everything wrong, from disease to disaster, was the direct consequence of
<BR>
Adam’s sin.  Of course, the disaster that appears to have wiped out the
<BR>
dinosaurs, some 65 million years ago, could hardly have been Adam’s fault.
<BR>
He wasn’t around yet.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if maybe we are experiencing, and contributing to a work in
<BR>
progress.  That would be cool.

<P><P><P>If all advanced space faring races have avoided interfering with the natural
<BR>
evolution of life on planets, such as ours, because they wish to see that
<BR>
latent potential realized then would they act to prevent natural disasters,
<BR>
such as earth-asteriod collisions, in order to preserve that potential?
<BR>
Evidently, if such advanced races exist, they don't care much about life as
<BR>
they certainly did not intervene during near fatal earth-asteriod collisions
<BR>
of the past.
