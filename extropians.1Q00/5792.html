<P>I find all population predictions past ~2020 void of any possible content.
<BR>
Why?  Because biotech will have totally altered the methods and cost basis
<BR>
of food production (making food much cheaper).  Secondly, biotech and
<BR>
medical devices will be making significant (increments of decades)
<BR>
extensions in life-expectancy, so the whole &quot;death&quot; part of the
<BR>
equation comes unglued.  Things like the WWW will be driving these
<BR>
technologies into the less affluent countries.
<BR>
<P>If nanotech and the singularity arrive by then, clearly all bets are off.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea that the most population unfreindly places could systain a 100% 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase in population is so ludicrous on its face it is obviously based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on false or icomplete premises.

<P>Not really, the problem is with the term &quot;unfriendly&quot;.  I've visited
<BR>
Pakistan, India and Thailand, all rather populous countries slated
<BR>
for big increases.  I see absolutely no problem with the possibility
<BR>
of those countries sustaining 100% increases.  Africa, with the
<BR>
exception of regions around the Sahara, could easily support increases
<BR>
of that magnitude because it is a very resource rich continent.
<BR>
<P>As documented by Willy Ley in &quot;Engineer's Dreams&quot; (1954), originally
<BR>
conceived by Herman Sorgel (in 1935), it is possible to dam the
<BR>
Congo river and make much more of Africa habitable.  The dam
<BR>
would produce a large &quot;Congo Lake&quot; in central Africa, then
<BR>
eventually overflow and create a &quot;Chad Sea&quot; where the Sahara
<BR>
is now located.  If the polticial obstacles to this could
<BR>
be overcome, you could support many, many more people in Africa
<BR>
than live there today.
<BR>
<P>He also documents, that you could dam the Strait of Gibralter,
<BR>
allow some of the Mediterannean to evaporate and expand the coastlines
<BR>
of all of the countries around that region.
