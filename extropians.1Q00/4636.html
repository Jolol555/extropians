<EM>&gt; My intent is not to resurrect an old and contentious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thread, &quot;Atheism vs. Agnosticism vs Theism&quot;, but to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post my own resolution of this vexed trinity.
</EM><BR>
<P>But you have done just that -- i.e., resurrect a thread.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The key to proper differentiation is, in my opinion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the concept of &quot;doubt&quot; and the &quot;doubtable&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree in this specific case.  I define &quot;theist&quot; as &quot;one who believes in
<BR>
a God or gods&quot; and &quot;atheist&quot; as &quot;one who is not a theist&quot; -- the latter does
<BR>
not have such beliefs.  This is a pure belief view of both.  By these
<BR>
definitions, no epistemology or argument is implied.  One could be an
<BR>
atheist merely because one was never taught about religion.  Or one could be
<BR>
an atheist because one blindly follows on this issue another person who is
<BR>
an atheist.  The same could be said of the theist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Regarding any proposition that must be either &quot;true&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or &quot;false&quot;, or any two positions one of which may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true but both of which cannot be &quot;true&quot;, then if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;willingly suspends belief&quot; in either and postpones a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical judgment one may be called a SKEPTIC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If, on the contrary, one affirms that either but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both is true (i.e. one is true and one is false)then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one may be called a DOGMATIST.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem here is Robert is using terms which connote certain things.
<BR>
Generally, a dogmatist is not one who believes such proposition because she
<BR>
has to choose, BUT rather one who believes without proper  validation.
<BR>
That's the conventional way the term is used.  As such, the term has a
<BR>
certain connotation -- i.e., that the dogmatist is irrational or, even when
<BR>
she is right, she's probably right for the wrong reasons.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, skeptic has certain connotations too.
<BR>
<P>But the key here is why does someone &quot;suspend judgment&quot;?  Just merely having
<BR>
contrary propositions, such as &quot;it's raining today&quot; versus &quot;it's NOT raining
<BR>
today&quot; is not enough.  The usual reason in this area -- theism vs.
<BR>
atheism -- is some claim there's not enough evidence to decide.  But that
<BR>
remains to be proven, because I would claim there IS enough evidence to
<BR>
decide in favor of atheism -- that is, atheism is defensible.  Likewise,
<BR>
many a theist would claim that there's enough evidence to justify theism,
<BR>
BUT that both sides make such claims is NOT an invitation to skepticism, but
<BR>
it is an invitation to examine the arguments and evidence.  Just that there
<BR>
are two possibilities does not reduce one to skepticism.  There always must
<BR>
be a basis for doubt.
<BR>
<P>(See my &quot;Comments on Pancritical Rationalism&quot; at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html</A> for some more on this.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this sense, the meaning of &quot;Agnostic&quot; is softened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from asserting that the logical status of a proposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is undecidable, to one that implies withholding judg-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ment given the current state of knowledge. And,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pari passu, propositions advanced by BOTH the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Atheist&quot; and &quot;Theist&quot; must be classified as &quot;Dogmatic&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>But by Robert's defintion, that I claim to exist and be conscious now makes
<BR>
me a dogmatist.:)  That Robert claims his view is correct regarding this
<BR>
classification -- i.e., that his meaning of agnostic is coherent and that
<BR>
the contrary view that it is not is not true -- makes him a dogmatist.  The
<BR>
terms become nearly useless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All this, of course, has the air of the profoundly trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it. But it does deal with several issues that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never been resolved.
</EM><BR>
<P>The reclassification neither resolves the issue nor does it point to a means
<BR>
of resolving them.  Also, I do NOT think of resolution as convincing others
<BR>
that a specific view is right or wrong, but by demonstrating that this is
<BR>
the case -- i.e., not by getting consensus because people can always remain
<BR>
skeptical for no good reason.
<BR>
<P>I still agree with George H. Smith's (as given in _Atheism: The Case Against
<BR>
God_) view that agnosticism is not an alternative to either atheism or
<BR>
theism.  Instead, it is totally confined to the issue of justification of
<BR>
belief.  Therefore, one can be an atheistic agnostic (don't believe in
<BR>
God/gods, but doesn't think it's possible to justify one's lack of belief)
<BR>
or a theistic agnostic (believes in God/gods, but doesn't think it's
<BR>
possible to justify one's belief) -- as well as a non-agnostic of either
<BR>
stripe (justifies one's belief in either position).  Most agnostics I've met
<BR>
do not claim to be either, but when I get to talking to them I find they are
<BR>
one or the other -- and most fall into the first category.
<BR>
<P>Myself?  I accept the Stratonician presumption as valid (those who posit a
<BR>
God or gods must validate Him of them; I don't have to prove a negative) and
<BR>
the argument from the primacy of existence as Leonard Piekoff states in
<BR>
_Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_ (existence is primary over
<BR>
consciousness, so no consciousness outside of existence is possible).  Of
<BR>
course, these are merely the strongests planks in my justification for my
<BR>
lack of belief.  I've yet to meet an theistic argument (whether argued by a
<BR>
theist or no) that stands up to scrutiny.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
