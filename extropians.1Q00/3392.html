</EM><BR>
<P>I define evil as simply abject selfishness. I believe if you analyze it
<BR>
carefully you will find at the heart of every heinous act of cruelty to another
<BR>
human being, that the perpetrator cared only for their own and immediate self
<BR>
gratification. Had they cared at all for others, enough to deny their own self
<BR>
gratification, they would not have acted cruelly. Hitler wasn't truly interested
<BR>
in Germany's future so much as he was in his own rise to and maintenance of
<BR>
power. He proves this in the many mistakes he made which sacrificed fellow
<BR>
Germans.
<BR>
<P>The same can be said for your basic serial killer or rapist. Regardless of what
<BR>
brought them to be the way they are in the end they only care about themselves.
<BR>
I could be wrong but I'd like to see if we can come up with some examples where
<BR>
evil acts occur in the absolute absence of abject selfishness.
<BR>
<P>My next thought would be how do we give a person a conscience? I know a lad born
<BR>
without one. For all intent and purpose he is absent a conscience. He feels
<BR>
nothing for anyone but himself. He seeks immediate self gratification
<BR>
constantly. He has violent tantrums when he doesn't get absolutely his way. He
<BR>
is officially diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, but
<BR>
his mother told me they also said he was genetically missing something in his
<BR>
brain. I'm not saying this is where the conscience resides. I'm just pointing
<BR>
out that ADHD is not his only woe. He certainly fits the bill for being one that
<BR>
could not really be held accountable for his actions. However, I don't think
<BR>
that every act of evil or cruelty towards another is as a result of illness.
