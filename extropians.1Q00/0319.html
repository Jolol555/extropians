Hmmm.  The normal argument, which I'm sure you've heard a dozen times, is
<BR>
as follows.  If somebody ever builds a Drexler-esque nano-assembler, the
<BR>
job's done: the assemblers make anything we've written the code to make,
<BR>
including more assemblers, very cheaply.  Open source software genies take
<BR>
over, and eventually we've got an Anything box.
<BR>
<P>The first assembler, in turn, will be built because somebody somewhere
<BR>
finds the project interesting, and because these days a good sum of money
<BR>
is still being thrown at Pure Research.  The Applied Whatever department
<BR>
at some university somewhere will build the first nano-assembler just to
<BR>
see if it can be done, or else some other large scale organization (it
<BR>
would be fitting if it were IBM) with a large R&amp;D department.  Last on the
<BR>
list is probably organizations like Zyvex, for the very reasons you
<BR>
mentioned: who's going to invest in a company that may eventually make
<BR>
investment irrelevant?
<BR>
<P>Nano-assemblers will get built eventually as our economy continues to
<BR>
flourish and as long as someone is still interested in Pure Research.
<BR>
Arguments to the contrary flounder in the face of large scale expensive
<BR>
physics projects; gigantic supercolliders and the like aren't profitable
<BR>
to anyone, aren't expected to be profitable to anyone, and yet governments
<BR>
around the world still throw billions of dollars at these projects.  Even
<BR>
if nanotech never gets that kind of funding, we just need the first
<BR>
assembler to get the rest.
