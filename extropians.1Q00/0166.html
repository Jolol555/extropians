<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;  we are taking intersex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  children and forcibly rendering them into one of two established
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gender schemas. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the heck is an intersex child? Enlighten me
</EM><BR>
<P>Intersex babies are born with characteristics of both genders.  They
<BR>
comprise a surprising percent of births (over 1% I think).  They are
<BR>
surgically altered to appear as a single gender.  Often they can be made
<BR>
into either gender, and the doctors must decide which one to choose.  More
<BR>
horribly, males with extremely small penis size are classified as such, and
<BR>
are often surgically made into females and raised as girls.  Also, females
<BR>
with an extremely large clitoris are classified as such and are surgically
<BR>
made into females.  These children often reach puberty only to have
<BR>
characteristics of the other gender appear spontaneously.  They often do not
<BR>
agree with the sex chosen for them.  When puberty manifests the other
<BR>
gender, they must choose to have further surgery or hormones to keep
<BR>
pretending to be the gender they always thought they were, or let nature
<BR>
take its course and appear to change sexes from what their family and
<BR>
friends have always known.
<BR>
<P>I studied such things in my biology minor, especially with my specialized
<BR>
interest in genetics.  To carry this topic further, not all XY chromosome
<BR>
children are male, and not all XX chromosome children are female.  Sometimes
<BR>
they are born with fully functional genitalia and appearance of the other
<BR>
gender.  There also are XO, XXY, XYY, XXXY and other genetic combinations.
<BR>
Sometimes people are born with a mix of gametes, meaning different cells
<BR>
have different DNA combinations.  Thus, even genetic testing does not answer
<BR>
the question of sex for many individuals.  The strict expectation of male or
<BR>
female gender does not resolve for a small percent of the population.
