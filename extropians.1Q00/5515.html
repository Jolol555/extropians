Dear Members,
<BR>
<P>I offer the following as a brief historical commentary on an article 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Wlliam Joy which appeared recently in &quot;Wired&quot; Magazine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ WHY THE FUTURE DOESN'T NEED US ~
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Joy's Thesis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our most powerful 21st-century technologies - robotics, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetics and nanotech - are threatening to make humans 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an endangered species. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the strong historical precedents, if open access
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to and unlimited development of knowledge henceforth puts 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us all in clear danger of extinction, then common sense 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demands that we reexamine even these basic, long-held 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beliefs. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Historical Perspective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>What Bacon actually said, &quot;for knowledge too is itself power&quot;, is
<BR>
neither unreasonable nor immodest; he merely indicated that,
<BR>
like political, and religious power, the knowledge to be gained 
<BR>
from this new Natural Philosophy is practical. Unlike the academic 
<BR>
Scholastic Philosophy, this pursuit has the ability not merely 
<BR>
to describe history but to make it. Bacon envisioned the creation 
<BR>
of a new and better world using this knowledge, a Utopia. This is 
<BR>
not what so disturbs Bill Joy. He says he is afraid of what has 
<BR>
become of Bacon's dream, that we have made no Brave New World -- 
<BR>
nor realized Bacon's Utopian vision. Instead we have created a 
<BR>
monster, a monolithic technoscientific beast, A Whore of Babylon
<BR>
whose temple has been built on the foundation stones of Joy's 
<BR>
vanished humanism.
<BR>
<P>Not only the Utilitarian Ideal , but the Enlightenment has been 
<BR>
perverted, so today we read on the lintels of Research Centers 
<BR>
&quot;Scientia est potentia&quot; -- a paraphrase Joy abhors. For he feels 
<BR>
that these Centers are virtually Pandora's Boxes whose seals 
<BR>
are being opened one by one to let loose on us us all the horrors 
<BR>
of Apocalypse with which the supplanted medieval academics were 
<BR>
were fully familiar and warned us against 500 years ago.
<BR>
<P>Of course, from its medieval origins, the magical arts and their
<BR>
inscrutable masters have been viewed uneasily by their societies. 
<BR>
No one could be quite sure just how dangerous this new white
<BR>
magic might be, but the Faust legend provides some inkling of 
<BR>
at least latent public misgiving. There was some dull fear,
<BR>
some instinctive feeling, that perhaps this new practice was 
<BR>
somehow unclean, perhaps even demonic.
<BR>
<P>It appears that Mr. Joy shares this ambivalence. There is more.
<BR>
He seems to see signs and alarms that portend some graver
<BR>
horror, worse than a mere box of plague and pestilence -- a
<BR>
modern Hydra whose heads replicate upon severance in a
<BR>
hyperexponential way. To do nothing is to relinquish social
<BR>
responsibility; to cut off heads would seem multiply our
<BR>
difficulties beyond control. Perhaps, he supposes, advancing 
<BR>
to the rear while saving the appearances is our only sensible
<BR>
option.
<BR>
<P>Of course, not everyone share's Bill Joy's desperation or
<BR>
brooding sense of catastrophe&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm as fond of my body as anyone, but if I can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be 200 with a body of silicon, I'll take it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
