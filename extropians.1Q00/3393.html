<P><EM>&gt; This depends a great deal on your definition of evil.  It is arguable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the extraordinary amount of capital expenditure required to &quot;fix&quot; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world's poverty issues would actually be a greater evil, diverting capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from projects with far greater potential for good.

<P>Statistics show that the average person produces more resources in a 
<BR>
lifetime than they consume. Those who have been educated tending to 
<BR>
produce far more than those who have not been. Organizations like the 
<BR>
Grameen (sp?) bank show that investing in the poor often pays off many 
<BR>
times over. One of the things that *I* plan to do with my money, should 
<BR>
one of my Internet ventures one day pay off big, is to see if I can't find 
<BR>
a way to invest in the poor of the world. Rather than being a huge capital 
<BR>
sink, I see it as one of the greatest untapped sources of wealth in the 
<BR>
world today.
