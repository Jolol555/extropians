Joseph Sterlynne quoted on Wed, 5 Jan 2000:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hal Finney
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe we have seen mostly failures in our own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debates here.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Allow a new list subscriber to say that he thinks that this is too pessimistic 
<BR>
a view.  I think that this mailing list, apart from really hugely inspiring 
<BR>
people, also really *does* prod people -- or that part of them who are/were 
<BR>
likely to exhibit any action anyway -- into more effective action, into more 
<BR>
effective ways of cooperation, and into a clearer perspective on and clearer 
<BR>
formulation of their goals; and from what I hear personally from some local, 
<BR>
older, list subscribers, many people think that so far this mailing list *has* 
<BR>
done these things admirably well. 
<BR>
<P>These open debates on this list may *seem* not to lead directly to many 
<BR>
immediate and tangible results, but I think that view disregards the many very 
<BR>
useful and fruitful cooperations and ideas that people subscribed to this 
<BR>
mailing list *are* gaining from this list -- and about which the people who 
<BR>
are individually benefiting and who (after some listening in and contributing 
<BR>
to discussions on this list) just quietly go do things perhaps send back 
<BR>
(?too) little feed-back. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For example, the Dutch &gt;H organization &quot;Transcedo&quot;, perhaps the 2nd 
<BR>
oldest European &gt;H organization, was started about 4 or 5 years ago by 4
<BR>
people who met each other on *this* mailing list; in its turn, this local 
<BR>
Dutch group 2.5 years ago organized the first European &gt;H gathering which
<BR>
has now snowballed into a solid annual event (called &quot;TransVision&quot;) with a 
<BR>
significant momentum of its own, and which in its turn again is I think 
<BR>
amazingly (and unexpectedly) much helping Transhumanism and Extropianism in 
<BR>
Europe getting organized.  The local Dutch group is enjoying growing attention
<BR>
from national media; and is enjoying a steadily increasing influx of new local
<BR>
people interested in Transhumanism; all of this will help strengthen the &gt;H 
<BR>
'movement' and will give it more man- and brain-power.  If it were not for the 
<BR>
discussions on this mailing list and the things inspired by them, then I think 
<BR>
Transhumanism in Europe might still be nearly non-existent.) 
<BR>
<P>Simply by being there as an open forum for exchange of ideas connected with 
<BR>
Transhumanism/Extropianism, I think that this mailing list already *has* a lot 
<BR>
of the effects and results you say are lacking from the debates on this list.  
<BR>
Perhaps the link between discussions and tangible results is less direct and 
<BR>
immediate than you want, but then again maybe the effects of these discussions 
<BR>
are mostly occurring in a more indirect, not centrally organized and/or 
<BR>
policed, i.e. in a 'Spontaneous Order' :-) kind of way. 
<BR>
<P>Best regards,    Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20Debate%20Failure%20(was:%20SOC:%20Opposition%20to%20Transhumanism)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000106123323.1174A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>; <A HREF="http://www.rubinghscience.org/">http://www.rubinghscience.org/</A>)
