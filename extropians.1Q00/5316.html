<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Robot%20Wars%20--%20time%20for%20a%20hardcore%20version?&In-Reply-To=&lt;38D42E1B.64C2@geocities.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the rules are primarily to protect the audience, and the venue,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from destruction.  Your idea of a no-rules contest is interesting,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really no-rules, just less and different rules. You'd 
<BR>
still have weight categories etc. to keep things reasonably
<BR>
fair (but a no-rules free-for-all would certainly also be an 
<BR>
option). The main difference would be the use of projectiles
<BR>
to disable opponents, and the generally greater realism of the 
<BR>
game.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but I don't see how you could arrange to have an audience enjoy it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe some remote cameras could be flown around, but that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive for the organizers.  And it wouldn't have the impact you get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now, with the audience crowding into the arena and hearing the metal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being cut and smelling the oil burning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also had the impression that the robots are remote controlled, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could expose the operators to danger in a no-rules version, since they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't get all that far from their machines.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the current (UK) show, the audience sits behind some sort
<BR>
of flexible transparent shielding (plastic), as do the operators 
<BR>
(the latter are in some closed compartment that's elevated 
<BR>
above the arena). I don't think they can smell, or even see,
<BR>
too much of the action, and they certainly aren't allowed to
<BR>
come anywhere near the arena during a match because of
<BR>
the possibility of flying bits etc. (and one of the house
<BR>
robots has a flame thrower). Also, the (UK) audience is
<BR>
relatively small, afaik, so getting rid of them altogether
<BR>
wouldn't make much of a difference. The cameras are
<BR>
the important bit, as most people watch the show on
<BR>
tv (and not live). The operators could be put in a bullet
<BR>
proof, elevated box or operate their robots form another
<BR>
room (concrete walls etc) via on-board cameras and the 
<BR>
studio monitors. You could even use some old bunker 
<BR>
complex for the show, if you really want to play it safe
<BR>
(and create the right atmosphere at the same time).
