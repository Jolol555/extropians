<P>Spike, when rational thinking doesn't work, the best solution is to
<BR>
rationalize the entire situation.  On the first of every month as he is
<BR>
climbing into his humvee, take him over a hot cream cheese bagal
<BR>
(or some other gift to grease the social mills) and tell him
<BR>
how much you want to thank him for making your life *sooo* very
<BR>
much nicer in the future.  When he asks what you are talking about,
<BR>
explain that in these days of environmental conservatism there are
<BR>
precious few people willing to pay lots of money to subsidize the
<BR>
increase the global (atmospheric) carbon resource that we will all
<BR>
be able to draw on for free in the future.
<BR>
<P>He is one heck of a nice guy your neighbor.  Throw in some jelly with
<BR>
the cream cheese for me.
