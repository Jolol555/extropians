<P>Tipler further explains, in that article:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But I accept the OPT [Omega Point Theory], since the known physical laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leave me no choice. As I pointed out to you in an earlier e-mail, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the universe were to expand forever, either because it is open or it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accelerated by a postive Lamdba, then Hawking has shown that unitarity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be violated. But unitarity is one of the central postulates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quantum Mechanics, confirmed again and again by every experiment to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; date.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not familiar with the result from Hawking he mentions (and I doubt
<BR>
that I could understand it anyway).  Unitarity is basically a kind of
<BR>
normalization principle in QM, similar to saying that probabilities
<BR>
must always add up to 100%.  It's not clear why an expanding universe
<BR>
would violate this, maybe something about the divergence to infinity.
<BR>
Of course relativity and QM have never been successfully merged, so I
<BR>
would imagine that any results along these lines have to be considered
<BR>
somewhat tentative.
<BR>
<P>It is good to see that Tipler continues to stick to his theory and predict
<BR>
that the recent observations will ultimately be shown to be in error.
<BR>
That is what you have to do with a falsifiable theory.
