Greg Burch forwards:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      Under the compromise, for two years after the protocol comes into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect, labels must say only that a product may contain such materials, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without specifics. During those two years, negotiators will work out more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific labels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the United States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds like it could be another &quot;Proposition 65&quot;.  This was a
<BR>
California initiative passed in 1986 which required notification to
<BR>
the public when toxic substances were used in products.  The idea was
<BR>
to force industry to clean up its act by making them scare people when
<BR>
they had to admit how poisonous their industrial methods were.
<BR>
<P>But from my perspective, it seems not to have had much effect.  Prop 65
<BR>
warnings are everywhere.  Companies are forced to run ads in the paper
<BR>
saying &quot;chemicals thought to be toxic are used in our products&quot;, gas
<BR>
stations put up signs, and so on.  But we don't even notice them anymore.
<BR>
They are just part of the urban scenery.  I can't imagine a company
<BR>
choosing to reformulate their products to avoid using toxics when they
<BR>
can just pay a couple of thousand dollars to run an ad in the paper.
<BR>
<P>If engineered crops are as common as the last paragraph above says,
<BR>
then I suspect the same thing will happen.  Corn and soy are two of the
<BR>
most widely used ingredients in processed foods.  Everything will be
<BR>
GM and no one will notice after a while.
