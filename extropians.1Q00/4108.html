R. Bradbury said:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please define &quot;adaptive mutations&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, if you simply mutate enough copies of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genome, sooner or later you *will* come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an &quot;adaptive&quot; mutation. This doesn't require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cellular &quot;consciousness&quot; or quantum evolution. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply requires the basic application of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanisms we already to know to be the case. Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you had hard evidence that adaptive mutations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were occuring *regularly* at *highly* improbable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequencies, then you might have a case for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting phenomena. However, to get those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numbers you have to keep track of how many genomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature threw away to get the adaptive variant. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those numbers are very difficult to come by in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations.
</EM><BR>
<P>As you probably guessed from context, &quot;adaptive
<BR>
mutations&quot; are those that seem to violate the &quot;sooner
<BR>
or later&quot; stuff. &quot;Adaptive mutations&quot; are those that
<BR>
occur so rapidly as to seem highly improbable.
<BR>
<P>You're right that it is an issue of numbers,
<BR>
probability; I cannot give you any. McFadden's outline
<BR>
has references to journal publications involving
<BR>
&quot;adaptive mutations&quot;. His outline has no precise
<BR>
numbers, but describes the results of experiments in
<BR>
layman's terms.
<BR>
<P>An example he gives is a bacteria that is unable to
<BR>
absorb lactose quickly undergoing mutations that allow
<BR>
it to absorb lactose when deprived of anything else to
<BR>
eat, and ONLY undergoing said mutation in that
<BR>
situation (that is, a control colony of the same
<BR>
bacteria does not undergo the same mutation in an
<BR>
environment where it has food it can absorb).
<BR>
<P>Some suggestions as to how to &quot;control&quot; nanotechnology
<BR>
involve having assemblers require a certain substance
<BR>
to survive so that you have the option of depriving it
<BR>
of that substance. Quantum evolution does not make
<BR>
that approach impossible, but does make it more
<BR>
complicated. That is, even if quantum evolution does
<BR>
occur, I'm fairly certain I would perish if trapped in
<BR>
an environment of only styrofoam. Quantum evolution
<BR>
(if it exists) can only do so much. The mutation of
<BR>
the aforementioned bacteria to allow it to absorb
<BR>
lactose is probably a very simple one, unlike to sort
<BR>
of mutation I would have to undergo to absorb
<BR>
stryrofoam.
<BR>
<P>A digression: I often wonder whether information
<BR>
theory has anything to say about how fast information
<BR>
could be added to DNA by non-random selection of
<BR>
random mutations. If you had models for the rate of
<BR>
information being added, and you knew how much
<BR>
information was stored in DNA, you could calculate how
<BR>
long it would take. If the results were that it would
<BR>
take too long, it would be reasonable to look for
<BR>
phenomenon like quantum evolution to help speed things
<BR>
up.
