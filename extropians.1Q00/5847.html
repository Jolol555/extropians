<P>I'm not so sure, infrared photons add to the vibrational energy of the

molecule.  I only think you will get momentum transfer if the photon
<BR>
is reflected (as in the case of a light sail).  Which raises an
<BR>
interesting point, if the photons are always going light speed,
<BR>
and they are transfering momentum to the light sail, then, *shouldn't*
<BR>
the photon being reflected back be of a lower frequency (to allow
<BR>
for conservation of energy)?  Hmmmmm...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, not only will the molecule be moving faster, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will be in an energized (excited) state, and will at some point in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near future fire off a photon in some (usually random) direction, so that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it can return to its normal state. Of course, when it fires off a photon, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it recoils and slows down, changing direction as it does. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The whole point of why you see color due to the fact that
<BR>
absorbed photons, *don't* get reemitted (except perhaps a lower
<BR>
frequency as heat).  What you are describing seems more like what occurs
<BR>
in lasers, when the photons passing through the material stimulate
<BR>
excited atoms to emit photons of a similar frequency.
<BR>
<P>I would agree that photons, when absorbed by a gas, increase
<BR>
the energy state of the molecules, but this can be in
<BR>
vibrational or rotational modes in addition to velocity.
<BR>
Most of the time, I don't think the photons are going to be
<BR>
re-emitted but instead, the increased pressure of the gas will
<BR>
transfer momentum to the walls of the container which will then radiate
<BR>
infrared photons as heat.   In the upper atmosphere, I suppose
<BR>
that you would see gas molecules functioning as a black body
<BR>
and radiating infrared photons.
