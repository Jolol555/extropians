<EM>&gt; &gt;'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wrong, wrong!!  I deny it, it wasn't me!!  It was...it was...it was, um...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh!  It was Mike Lorrey, yeah that's it!
</EM><BR>
<P>Typical fascist, blaming someone else for your problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not really.  In fact this sort of power-proportional transparency is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in effect in some ways.  Right now we can know much more about President
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Clinton than he could ever know about you.  I know where and when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;travels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; abroad.  I know why he has gone there and whom he talked to and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; talked about.  If I wanted to I could, in a matter of minutes, find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; his agenda is for next week, where he'll be and what he'll be doing.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact its probably fair to say that Clinton is the *most* surveilled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the planet, as it should be.  And he has been kept alive by his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; detail for a little more than 5 minutes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes, but there's a hell of a lot you DON'T know about Clinton, especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wrt his top military generals, the FBI, and the CIA.  For comparison, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bet you don't know a damn thing about what the men at the head of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organizations are talking about on a day-to-day basis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is certainly as it should be, as it's hard to imagine these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organizations doing their jobs effectively without this sort of secrecy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power proportional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Without offering an evidence that it would not be. There are very few countries
<BR>
today where a national leader can go about his business like an average person.
<BR>
The rate of assassination of national leaders is somewhere around 60%,
<BR>
worldwide. Those that stay in power longest are those who don't expose
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Once, and if, national sovereignty ends or wanes, there will still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other forms of corporate organizations (a government is actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;but a corporation with a monopoly on setting the rules of the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;use of overwhelming force) that will gain pre-eminence. Private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;corporate structures, which owe no allegiance to national governments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bills of human rights, or philosophical principles other than making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;money and the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are going to end government corporations, you must also end the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;formation of other corporate structures as well...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, not really.  Microsoft would be a likely candidate for your big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;scary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; corporation scenario.  But what can Microsoft do to abridge my human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rights?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;   It cannot legally amass an army.  The worst it could do is obtain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; insurmountable monopoly in the marketplace such that my choice as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be restrained.  And as we see in the news everyday, even that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is significanly curtailed by antitrust legislation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You seem to have missed the antecedent &quot;if national sovreignity ends or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wanes...&quot; Nobody would claim that this is the case today.  National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sovreignity is alive and well, for better or worse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps you came in late in the thread, but Mike Lorrey was replying to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proposal that once a democratic &quot;Global&quot; government was in place there would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be no need for such things as &quot;national&quot; security.  I never proposed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *all* government disappear.  I don't want to (nor expect that I ever will)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live in a global anarchy.  I presume that there will *always* be rules and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means by which to ensure that they are complied with.  A global government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be no less a government than a national government.  And as long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is government, and as long as antitrust rules are deemed beneficial to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society, there will be antitrust rules and the means by which to enforce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about anti-trust action against government. After all, its a monopoly, and
<BR>
for one monopoly to go around destroying other monopolies is not justice, its
<BR>
merely showing the hypocracy of the idea of government.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Gun control like you advocate has always led to total confiscation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sooner or later, in every country, state, and city in which it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;allowed to become law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Examples, please.  Even if that is the case, that is not what *I*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (at least not yet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is a problem of entailment of consequences.  You find it in policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;debate more than anywhere else, IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Alice:  We should not abide by your proposal that X, because Y will follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from it.  (where Y is something nasty)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Bob:  But I'm not proposing that Y.  I'm proposing that X.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Clearly, Bob's making a kind of mistake here.  Assuming that X does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*indeed* lead to Y, you CAN'T just propose X without proposing that X &amp; Y.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well here's how it would really go:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael:  We should not abide by your proposal for reasonable gun control,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because universal disarmament will follow from it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero:  But I'm not proposing universal disarmament.  I'm proposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable gun control.  Because (a) I don't believe that one necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follows the other and (b) although universal disarmament may be a bad thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be bad in the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>As long as one person wants what another person has, or hates another person for
<BR>
no good reason, there will always be a need for people to defend themselves
<BR>
against violence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, you must have come into the thread late.  You seem to completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misunderstand (a) what I am proposing and (b) why I think it would be a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea.  I am not necessarily proposing omniscience for the masses.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advocate &quot;transparency.&quot;  There is a difference.  In particular I advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power proportional transparency which means that the more power you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect the lives of others the more exposed you must be.  Such that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the designated leader of the free world, you will live under a virtual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microscope with nearly everything about you being recorded and available for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perusal by those whose lives you have the power to effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also propose that the transparency be mutual and two-way, such that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anytime I access any information about you, you can automatically be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notified of (a) what information I got about you, (b) when I got it, (c) how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I got it, (d) who I am, and (e) whatever information I got about you, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be given about me.  For instance say I looked up Dan Fabulich's home
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address and telephone number.  You would be notified that I did that and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would, if you wanted, be notified of my home address and telephone number.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You could also be notified of where, when and how I make use of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
<P>In your world, the average person would be deluged every day by notifications
<BR>
that they were monitored by 200 national intelligence and law enforcement
<BR>
agencies, 3,465,783 corporations, and 54,567,892 individuals. If you think your
<BR>
inbox is big now, wait till your xanadu is reached....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; None of this would necessitate you searching a huge database, or having a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very powerful computer.  It would be the equivolent of receiving an e-mail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or an automated telephone call.  Now if for whatever reason you were the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort that got his jollies by compiling huge amounts of data on a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portion of the population and conducting all sorts of analysis on it, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps you would need a fairly fast computer.  However, given the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technology needed to fully implement my proposals is probably *decades*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down the road, by the time you needed to do that sort of research I'm fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain you'll be able to afford all the computing power you need to do it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although keeping in mind that for everytime you *get* information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone else you also have to *give* that same information about yourself, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know how anxious you would be to be doing research on 90% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population.  That could very well make you a *very* popular guy :)
</EM><BR>
<P>So what if I tell 6 billion people what my sexual preference is? I tell that one
<BR>
fact, and I can get 6 billion facts on the same question about each and every
<BR>
one of those people. Its not equivalent. I may have pissed off a small small
<BR>
minority, but I now KNOW a huge amount of data about a lot of people, and that
<BR>
gives me power.
