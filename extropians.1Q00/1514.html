<EM>&gt; After having several discussions with local Bahai, and failing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see what exactly God is doing in this relatively decent set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social notions, I came to the conclusion that this teaching was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt to sneak the modern secular ideology into the Moslem world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the guise of religion.  While providing a good alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fundamentalism and a somewhat hypocritical excuse of &quot;staying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religious&quot; to those who need this, for people with already open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minds it looks like a particularly convoluted way of wasting time...
</EM><BR>
<P>Old-fashioned &quot;big religion&quot; used to be, among other things, for
<BR>
the function of bringing together people of dissimilar economic
<BR>
and cultural interests, and it's hard to see how small sectarian
<BR>
religions can do this very well.  
<BR>
<P>As small sects go, I've always been much more impressed by the
<BR>
Religious Society of Friends (<A HREF="http://www.quaker.org">http://www.quaker.org</A>) than by the
<BR>
Bahai, though I am prejudiced, since my mother was raised within
<BR>
that sect and my father was convinced to it. I'm particularly
<BR>
impressed by the Friends' teaching of the ministry of all believers
<BR>
(women have been recognized ministers among Friends since the very
<BR>
beginnings in the English Civil War of the 1640s).  There are,
<BR>
however, some evangelical Friends with hireling ministry who are
<BR>
not nearly as impressive to me.
<BR>
<P>Also, they aren't bibliolaters.  In First Day School I was
<BR>
taught to sing &quot;For the Book it will perish, and the steeple
<BR>
will fall, but the Light will be shining at the end of it all.&quot;
<BR>
Is that Tiplerian enough for you?  :D
<BR>
<P>Most of the people on this list who will have problems with the
<BR>
Friends will, I suspect, be those distressed by the Friends'
<BR>
persistent habit throughout the last century of harboring suspected
<BR>
Communists.  And mainstream Christians consistently suspect Hicksite
<BR>
Friends (like my parents) of Unitarianism or worse.
