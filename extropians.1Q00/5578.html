<P>
repost of earlier SC post. I think an organization like this- that would
<BR>
itself help get projects funded- would be good.
<BR>
<P>I also think that due to certain &quot;taboos&quot;, not enough money is being
<BR>
spent on extending biological lifespans in general. Anything from
<BR>
extending cell lifespans to better cryonics needs to be funded.

We have occasionally expressed various thoughts in this 
<BR>
direction, but haven't really done anything.
<BR>
Maybe this, more carefully argued, letter from Nick
<BR>
Cassimatis (my friend, colleague, and fellow extropian
<BR>
working in the MIT Media Lab) will help move things forward?

<EM>&gt;Subject: Putting internet money to good use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2000 01:06:42 -0500
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The hordes of new internet millionaires throwing their money away to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the usual charities represent a new philanthropic impulse than we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;channel to important extropian research.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that these people do not realize that some very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important science and technology goes unfunded by the multi-billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dollar US technology budget.  An organization explicitly devoted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;science and technology philanthropy would change some of this.  Just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like old-style philanthropists know to give money to the United Way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to help the poor, this proposed organization would be known as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;place to give money to important, cutting-edge science and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I suspect that by merely existing and promoting itself as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philanthropic vehicle, much more money would move into good science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I see three possible structures for this.  Each has different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advantages and should be tried:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(1) A clearinghouse for important, underfunded science.  People could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go to a web site, find appealing science and make donations.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organization would be a middle man making it very easy for both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philanthropists and scientists to use the site and provide the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;non-profit&quot; legal status needed for tax purposes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(2) A foundation that raises money and distributes it according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its board's decisions.  This is a turn-key solution for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philanthropist; he can write a check, feel good and forget about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(3) An philanthropic incubator or venture fund.  This is perhaps the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most novel idea.  People will not be giving away their money, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be making an investment in a good thing that might or might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pay off.  The problem with this is that you may have to focus more on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;profits in some cases than you'd like.  The benefit is a potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;huge endowment through the IPOs of some of the ventures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The key behind each of these approaches is to tap the philanthropic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impulses of the new millionaires to create a large vein of capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for good research.  Whatever their underlying activities, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations need to be promoted as a place for &quot;do gooders&quot; to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I send you two this note because you are probably the two best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;positioned people to make something like this happen.  Feel free to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incorporate these ideas as much or as little as you want without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Best,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-Nick
