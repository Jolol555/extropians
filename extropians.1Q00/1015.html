<EM>&gt;people view this like manufacturing a car?

<P>Robert, get a grip! Sorry to say this, but that kinda comment is what you'd
<BR>
expect to hear from kids in the locker room without an emotional clue. (I
<BR>
assume - I've never been in the locker room.) Women's bodies are changed
<BR>
drastically by that clump of cells, and their minds, and their emotions,
<BR>
especially given 15 or 20 or 50 years of profound personal immersion in a
<BR>
(largely women's) culture of nurturance. Even women who go through the pain
<BR>
and anxiety of in vitro conception (and I've known one at least and seen
<BR>
others interviewed) don't and perhaps can't regard the process as if it
<BR>
were building a car. Ach! 
<BR>
<P>Which is what makes abortion (usually) so difficult an issue, even for
<BR>
those without a religious bone in their brain. I've been involved in
<BR>
several, and finally had myself speyed because it wasn't fair to put
<BR>
another human at risk of that unpleasantness. (And I didn't wish to find
<BR>
myself suddenly a father, with all those responsibilities; and yes, in each
<BR>
case we had taken what seemed to be the best available precautions.)
<BR>
<P>And yes, at some point that technical proficiency will arrive. I hope those
<BR>
in charge of it have some empathy for women's long suffering and creative
<BR>
experiences of pregnancy.
<BR>
<P>Damien (yeah, yeah, the Pious) (but also the slightly angry)
