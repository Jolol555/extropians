</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You raise some interesting points, but I think there's another way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking at it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume (based on your header) that you're responding to me and not to
<BR>
QueeneMUSE.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I tend to think of consciousness as an instantaneous phenomenon: In every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instant we are alive, and in every instant we die and are then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reborn. It's only memory that generates the illusion of continuity
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that we can assume that we don't actually die every instant.  This
<BR>
is basically a sort of metaphor or fantastic reworking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Take, for example, Star Trek style transporter rays. You take me apart,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an atom at a time, throw the remnants away and reconstruct a copy at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distance. In at least an intuitive sense, the copy 'isn't me.' You've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; murdered me, albeit in a peculiarly baroque way. The fact that there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone else walking around who thinks he's me is, from my oblivious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perspective, neither here nor there. I'm dead - just as dead as if you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shot me or cut off my head. For the copy, of course, the experience is of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course one of displacement.
</EM><BR>
<P>You said that there's another way of looking at it but how is this
<BR>
different than my description?
