<P>I agree with most, if not all of the things you mentioned
<BR>
regarding the advantages of open source.  I'll just pick
<BR>
a few nits...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the complexity is too great, the original design was wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>The complexity can be too great because (a) the underlying
<BR>
hardware base keeps evolving &amp; expanding (ala the PC platform),
<BR>
or (b) the people really didn't understand the problem when
<BR>
the started and a lot of &quot;R&amp;D&quot; had to be done before the
<BR>
complexity became apparent.  I'll cite two cases where
<BR>
I have extensive knowledge -- compiler design and databases.
<BR>
In the first case we are *still* evolving compilers 30+
<BR>
years after their development and in the second case we
<BR>
are still learning about optimal query languages, data
<BR>
organization, indexing approaches, object clustering, etc.
<BR>
<P>The complexity is inherent in compilers and databases because
<BR>
of the variety of tasks they may be asked to perform.  As you
<BR>
continue to &quot;add-on&quot; to these programs they get more and more
<BR>
complex until you have to throw out what you started with
<BR>
and rethink things.  I'd cite the human genome as another
<BR>
example, though humans didn't have their hands in that one...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Open Source can, and does, take the time for this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you point out one of the down sides which is the long
<BR>
lead time until you see working code.  I think Perl 6 has
<BR>
been in cooking for 2+ years now.  While having open source
<BR>
produced primarily by a single individual with the big picture
<BR>
(or groups if the problem can be sub-divided), in the real
<BR>
world there are people who need the problem solved yesterday
<BR>
and are willing to go pay someone to solve it.  When you
<BR>
are paying for it, thats when you start to get into the
<BR>
discussion of &quot;ownership&quot; and &quot;property rights&quot;.  What
<BR>
eBusiness startup wants to do a Java application for order
<BR>
invoicing and have it open source for the next competitor
<BR>
to use?!?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Problems that cannot be solved by the normal support people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fixed by the people that wrote the software in the first place!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is a very important point, but you always have the problem
<BR>
of people moving onto other things and becoming unavailable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; True for applications, not true for the operating system or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools themselves. The kernel, gcc and glibc people (to name a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few) are still programming at a fairly low level.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd suspect most of the kernel work is going into external interface
<BR>
components (e.g. filesystems, device drivers, installation scripts,
<BR>
etc.).  Gcc has got a new architecture to contend with coming down
<BR>
the road.   I doubt very much work is being done with glibc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... hindered by timezones and no longer by company-mandated secrecy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or geographical distances.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I agree you can do a lot over the net now that you couldn't do
<BR>
before, there are many problems that are best solved by brainstorming
<BR>
with all the people in the same room.  There may be people who can
<BR>
do this effectively over the net, but I have *yet* to see a public
<BR>
net multi-time-zone interactive white-board videoconference that works.
<BR>
Only if those individuals work in locations where you have some very
<BR>
pricey hardware can this be made to work currently.
<BR>
<P>But otherwise a nice commentary on the open source approach.
