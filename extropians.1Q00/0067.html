I just signed on to receive the message service so that I may find out more about the Extropian movement. It has been interesting. I have been somewhat concerned about the rampant elitism running through the postings. Something that seem quite out of keeping with  people who purport to be acting in the best interest of humanity. Even so, I have viewed this to be due to the excesses of some members as I have not heard anything similar from Max Moore. So, I was beginning to believe that it would be something worthwhile to be a part of. However, when Greg Burch wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've decided that a more systematic approach to concern about sources of opposition to our ideals and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goals is necessary.  To this end, I've begun work on a website in which I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will collect links to groups and resources that appear to present a current 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or potential threat to the transhumanist agenda.
</EM><BR>
<P>This gave me pause to reconsider. This is the Vice President of the Extropy Institute whom I assume has leadership support for this announcement. So, I am in complete agreement with Robert Owen when he wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I wish to give notice here that I must dissociate myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and my organization from any effort to politicize our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Transhumanist Movement.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All that is visible now is a recurrence of an earlier trend;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is my fervent hope that this fine community will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;support such a counterproductive and self-defeating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mission.
</EM><BR>
<P>Eliezer Yudkowsky in quite correct in his response to Robert Owen's note that we exist in a political environment. Of course. Any relationship between people is in the broadest sense political, but this different. Even so, it is unclear what the opposition is. Already people are buying into the program in many ways and values are changing. All I can see is that some do not feel things are going fast enough. This is &quot;youth&quot; talking. Greg's posting stands out all the more because it is the thinking and tactics of agrarian and industrial age plotters and revolutionaries, something the world is learning to leave behind. I strongly suggest that members become aquatinted with the history of some of the leaders and participants of the political and social movements of the last 200 years. It is most instructive.
<BR>
<P>I do wish the group the best in resolving this issue.
