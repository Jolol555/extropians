<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Don't get me wrong.  I wish there was a bunch more research being done on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;nano, cryo and immortality.  But the only way to get funding for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;research is to convince people that there money is better spent there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;people we already share this planet with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't think there's any such problem. We spend billions on research for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;diseases like Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, and prostate cancer, where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;result will only benefit old people in rich countries.  Much less gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;spent on research for 3rd world food production.  I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;attitudes would be substantially different about longevity research, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;new way of benefitting old people in rich countries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was replying to a message which suggested supporting longevity research as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that would benefit the rich first, then trickle down to mere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mortals later.  In other words &quot;Lets fund research that will benefit the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rich because, eventually, you might be able to afford it to.&quot;  Of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research that will benefit citizens of rich countries will get funded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it is primarily those rich countries that are doing the research.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is different from trying to fund research that will benefit rich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *people* in rich countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its been conclusively shown that there IS no third world hunger problem,
<BR>
at least as far as food production is concerned. The agricultural
<BR>
production in the 3rd world is sufficient for a 3500 calorie diet for
<BR>
every man, woman, and child. What the problem is is that the
<BR>
transportation, processing, and storage infrastructure is either poor or
<BR>
non-existent, so much or most of that food goes to waste. Additionally,
<BR>
most ALL 'famines' are the creations of governments as tools of
<BR>
opression and/or warfare. You want to 'solve' world hunger, solve those
<BR>
problems. The food is already out there.
