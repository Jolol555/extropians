<EM>&gt; &gt;Just time for a brief response.  I would never say &quot;I believe the Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will rise tomorrow.&quot;  I would prefer &quot;I EXPECT&quot; the sun to rise tomorrow&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which is a very different proposition. Or, to probe a little deeper, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;might say &quot;IF the sun doesn't rise tomorrow, THEN our formulations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of the Mechanics of Planetary Motion, or the Psychophysiology of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Human Perception, or both, are either incomplete or gravely flawed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Then you would be incredibly wrong.  Any ten year old could tell you that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sun does *not* rise; had you said this a millenium ago (when people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commonly *believed* it to be true) your 'expectation' would have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumed correct.

<P>Now I'm going to put aside your gauche impertinence and captiousness
<BR>
to point out to you that the quoted paragraph is a reply to a post by

said:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I suspect that you believe the sun will rise tomorrow.&quot;
<BR>
<P>That is what we say, isn't it? You evidently disdain this conventional
<BR>
metaphorical description and express the physical situation in a much more
<BR>
sophisticated manner. I'm sure you luxuriate in a fantasy about how others
<BR>
are impressed with your acumen.
<BR>
<P>What impresses me are your coarse manners and the extent to which your
<BR>
self-importance is based on a pompous assumption that you have somehow
<BR>
managed to transform trivial platitudes into profundities.
<BR>
<P>I apologize to the list for this exasperated statement, but I simply cannot
<BR>
tolerate the sheer loutishness and incivility exhibited here by this supercilious
<BR>
young man.
<BR>
<P>There isn't the slightest possibility of any consideration of your subsequent
<BR>
remarks, Shaun, unless you resolve to present yourself in a reasonably
<BR>
acculturated manner, meaning, as a gentleman.
