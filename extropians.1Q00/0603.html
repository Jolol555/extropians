<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All I know about that situation I got from the popular press--which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;means I effectively know zilch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you actually understand what's going on in Chechnia, I'd love
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have it explained to me. Or rather, can anybody recommend any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pointers on where to read up on this &quot;conflict&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I'm interested in the Chechen Independence Fight for several
<BR>
reasons, and while I'm far from expert, perhaps I can give a
<BR>
synopsis. I found a good source of articles at:
<BR>
<P>The Andrei Sakharov Foundation website:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wdn.com/asf/">http://www.wdn.com/asf/</A>
<BR>
(look in &quot;Archive&quot;, and then &quot;Chechnya Brief&quot;)
<BR>
<P>And since I was interested in seeing photos of the Chechnya area (I
<BR>
wanted to see how similar the terrain was to the terrain in
<BR>
Afghanistan), I found some pics and more articles at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.amina.com/">http://www.amina.com/</A>
<BR>
<P>Take a look at some of the mountainous areas. (Pretty spectacular
<BR>
scenery, I might add.)
<BR>
<P>These Chechnya pics:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/mount8.jpg">http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/mount8.jpg</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/page103.jpg">http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/page103.jpg</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/page44.jpg">http://www.amina.com/images/mountains/page44.jpg</A>
<BR>
<P>do remind me a bit of the pictures I've seen of the mountainous
<BR>
areas (not the desert) of Afghanistan.
<BR>
<P>I should say, up front, that I'm hardly un-biased, as I carry a
<BR>
passport from one of those little countries (Latvija) that was
<BR>
forcibly occupied by the former Soviet Union for half of last
<BR>
century.
<BR>
<P>The Chechens are indigenous to the North Caucasus area for several
<BR>
thousand years. They are not a Slavic people, as near as I can tell.
<BR>
The Chechen language is a non-Slavic, non-Turkish, non-Persian
<BR>
language, and it is supposed to be closely related to Ingush language,
<BR>
and probably to nothing else (similar to the situation with Latvian
<BR>
and Lithuanian languages) but I can't find the Chechen branch in my
<BR>
language books. (Maybe it's not an Indo-European language. Does
<BR>
anyone know?)
<BR>
<P>The Chechens' ties to the Russian Empire go back a few hundred years
<BR>
(to the 16th century). Before the 16th century, Iranian Alans and
<BR>
and a group called the Golden Horde (don't know who that is) overran
<BR>
their territory.
<BR>
<P>Fighting between the two (Chechens and Russians) has been an ongoing
<BR>
thing for the last few centuries.  One long battle lasted from 1824
<BR>
until 1859, when a (Muslim) man led his peoples of the North
<BR>
Caucasus against the Russian invaders. The Russians won by sheer
<BR>
force of numbers, and by carrying out a policy of a destructive
<BR>
total war from fortress towns such as Grozny. The &quot;Caucasian War&quot;
<BR>
continued on a reduced scale until 1864, and there continued to be
<BR>
intermittent outbreaks of armed resistance to Russian rule in the
<BR>
late 19th and early 20th centuries.
<BR>
<P>In the early 1900s through the years until 1944, Chechnya was given
<BR>
the status of Autonomous Oblast of the Russian Federation and then a
<BR>
short time later, given status of Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet
<BR>
Socialist Republic (ASSR). But Stalin's forced collectivisation
<BR>
efforts and purges of 1936-38 (where thousands of Chechens were
<BR>
killed or imprisoned) increased anti-Soviet sentiment. And in 1944
<BR>
the Soviets really stomped on the Chechens by deporting 400,000
<BR>
Chechens and Ingush to Soviet Central Asia. There, about 30% or more
<BR>
died during their detention and transport from the Caucasus or
<BR>
within the first year of their forcible resettlement. The bitter
<BR>
feelings that the Chechens carry towards the Russians are pretty
<BR>
deep.
<BR>
<P>[Note, in the years 1941, 1945-8, Stalin's guys also deported,
<BR>
displaced, or executed at least half-million Baltic (Estonian,
<BR>
Latvian, Lithuanian) folks, reducing their population in the Baltics
<BR>
by at least 30%. This pattern holds for other ethnic groups
<BR>
of other countries under Stalin's realm of influence, as well.]
<BR>
<P>On November 27, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR
<BR>
adopted a &quot;Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the
<BR>
Chechen-Ingush Republic.&quot; Since &quot;sovereignty&quot; was also proclaimed at
<BR>
this time by other Soviet Republics, the Chechen-Ingush declaration
<BR>
did not cause particular concern, despite the implicit upgrade in
<BR>
status from that of Autonomous Republic within the Russian
<BR>
Federation. In spring 1991, the Chechen leaders called for the
<BR>
unconditional recognition of the Chechen nation's right to
<BR>
independence, compensation for crimes committed against the Chechen
<BR>
nation, trials of the guilty, and establishment of a government
<BR>
based on democratic principles. The Ingush leaders however, did not
<BR>
follow suit because their chief concern was to regain ancestral
<BR>
territory to the west, and the Ingush leaders believed that their
<BR>
claims to Prigorodny raion could best be achieved by remaining
<BR>
within the Russian Federation.
<BR>
<P>The battle for Chechens' independence has simply continued from that
<BR>
time. Neither the Chechens or the Russians are recognizing each
<BR>
other as holding any valid claim for anything in that region. Russia
<BR>
has been expanding southwards for centuries. Nothing new there. The
<BR>
Chechens are fighting for their freedom: for themselves, their
<BR>
families, their villages, and their religion.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Russian propaganda for why
<BR>
the Russians are fighting in Chechnya is to &quot;free their women&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;modernize their country&quot; (these are what they told the world about
<BR>
invading Afghanistan), or to &quot;protect them against the threat of
<BR>
incursion&quot; (what they told the world in 1939 for why they were
<BR>
occupying Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). Oh.. those invisible
<BR>
&quot;bandits&quot; are such troublemakers, aren't they?
<BR>
<P>To the Russians, the Chechens present a special problem because of
<BR>
their characteristics of fierceness and because of their living in
<BR>
inaccessible mountainous terrain. I believe that it was also these
<BR>
reasons that the Afghanis (who are a hard, proud, mountain people)
<BR>
presented such a problem to the Soviets during that 1979-1989 war.
<BR>
On the other hand, the Baltic people, by their nature, are
<BR>
relatively passive people, and their country is easily accessible:
<BR>
the Baltic countries are mostly flat with a lot of nearby waterways.
<BR>
<P>Who's arming the Chechens, and are the Chechens capturing their
<BR>
weapons in a similar way from the Russians, as the Afghanis did, 20
<BR>
years ago? It looks like 'yes'. I found this text in one of the
<BR>
articles at the Sakharov Web site:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Chechen forces are made up of the National Guard and other
<BR>
regular army units, including many soldiers with Afghan war
<BR>
experience; the volunteer militia, subject also to central command
<BR>
and discipline, in which a great proportion of able-bodied Chechen
<BR>
males participate, some on a part-time basis; and &quot;the avengers,&quot;
<BR>
individuals or small groups, whose relatives have been killed, and
<BR>
who, acting on their own, seek blood vengeance in accord with
<BR>
Chechen custom. The Chechens' weapons, which include some artillery
<BR>
and armor and plentiful supplies of sophisticated anti-tank weapons,
<BR>
Kalashnikov automatic rifles, ammunition, and grenades, are Russian
<BR>
in origin. They were handed over to the Chechens in 1991, seized
<BR>
during raids on Russian arms depots in 1992, or bought at various
<BR>
times from corrupt Russian officers and other arms dealers. &quot;
<BR>
<P>Both Chechnya and Afghanistan are primarily Moslem countries. I
<BR>
think that it is unfortunate that the West associates the words
<BR>
&quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;Moslem&quot; with &quot;terrorist&quot; because there are different
<BR>
Moslem countries that differ in their practices. I don't know the
<BR>
&quot;brand&quot; of Islam that the Chechens practice, but in Afghanistan,
<BR>
before &quot;The Catastrophe&quot; (as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the
<BR>
Soviets was called), their brand of Islam was very temperate. Women
<BR>
were going to college, walking unveiled, holding government
<BR>
positions. An atmosphere of tolerance existed for differing
<BR>
interpretations of Islam.  Their Sunnis and Shias worked together,
<BR>
and some in that country felt that Afghanistan was providing a model
<BR>
for a liberal Islamic state. Of course, that's not true in
<BR>
Afghanistan now.
<BR>
<P>In hard times, the extremists in any kind of religious system
<BR>
prevail, so it's not surprising to me that the hard-core
<BR>
Fundamentalist Moslems are in control now in Afghanistan. Also the
<BR>
best fighters were the most hard-core Fundamentalist Moslems, and
<BR>
Afghanistan needed its best fighters for those 10 years of war.
<BR>
Maybe what will emerge from the Chechnya war will be a similar
<BR>
hard-core Fundamentalist Islam (I hope not).
<BR>
<P>[Maybe I should add here, that one evening, 7 years ago, I was
<BR>
accidently (oops!) initiated as a Moslem (in a Mosque in middle-Palo
<BR>
Alto, California). Oh, don't worry, I'm a hard-core atheist, but I
<BR>
learned quite a lot in that evening, observing/participating in a
<BR>
very old and hours-long Moslem prayer ritual with several hundred
<BR>
Moslems, with me segregated in the back, behind the wall, with the
<BR>
other women. It was a fascinating experience.]
<BR>
<P>I just finished reading a book that describes some of the 1979-1989
<BR>
Soviet-Afghan war: _The Wind Blows Away Our Words: A Firsthand
<BR>
Account of the Afghan Resistance_, by Doris Lessing. One reason the
<BR>
book opened my eyes was that very little of what really happened  in
<BR>
Afghanistan (especially the magnitude) made it into U.S. mainstream
<BR>
media. It's probably safe to say that there were ten million Afghan
<BR>
refugees (I doubt that they all returned to Afghanistan after the
<BR>
War). A whole generation of intellectuals vanished (into prisons,
<BR>
etc). Perhaps some Americans in influential positions didn't like
<BR>
the picture of a group of poor, dirty, ragged muhjahidin
<BR>
successively fighting against a huge Communist power, instead of
<BR>
Americans succeeding.
<BR>
<P>I was already impressed with many of the actions of the Afghan
<BR>
people, and that book increased my respect 100 times. Here are some
<BR>
of the reasons that I admire the Afghan people, from what I read in
<BR>
that book (this touches on some extropian topics):
<BR>
<P>* The Soviet had many agents inside the Kabul governments to watch
<BR>
and control the Afghanis, and the Afghanis had just as many, or
<BR>
more, watching the Soviets. The Afghans were aware of almost every
<BR>
Soviet move.
<BR>
<P>* The Afghanis had almost none of their own weapons: what they used
<BR>
to win that war were captured from the Soviets whom they killed.
<BR>
<P>* In the refugee camps in Pakistan (where most of the refugee
<BR>
Afghans fled), one had to be registered with one of the political
<BR>
parties to get food rations. This means that people who were not
<BR>
members of a political party who were unregistered did not get
<BR>
rations, and so, those who were the most independent-minded, who did
<BR>
not want to be defined by a party, had an extremely difficult time
<BR>
keeping themselves and their families fed. I think that there were
<BR>
hundreds or thousands of such folk.
<BR>
<P>* The Pakistan refugee camps were full of Afghans who started every
<BR>
kind of little business- they were far from &quot;passive recipients&quot; of
<BR>
aid and food. They were selling food, Afghan hangings, carpets,
<BR>
brassware, clothes, mementos of the dead Russian soldiers, etc. The
<BR>
Pakistanis complained that the Afghans were taking their jobs, and
<BR>
the Afghanis' reply was: &quot;We are not taking your jobs, we start our
<BR>
own businesses.&quot;
<BR>
<P>* Women were deeply involved in the Afghan-Soviet war.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One woman was a commander with directing 3000 muhjahidin.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Young women carried arms, ammunition, and information
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under their veils. The prettier ones attracted Russians
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or Kabul agents and led them to houses where muhjahidin were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Women obtained information about those collaborating with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soviets from their connection in administration jobs, and passed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that information on to the urban Resistance groups or for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of commanders in the countryside.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The majority of cases of Russian agents who disappeared or were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed were due to the initiative of women. The women were also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for the majority of the bomb explosions.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Women were caught, imprisoned and tortured (as were the men).

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When they [Chechens] resorted to kidnapping foreigners, they probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;killed chances they might have had for getting foreign recognition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, not a smart move. Maybe the Chechens should have adopted a
<BR>
symbolic resistance strategy for the outside world to see, that the
<BR>
Balts used.
<BR>
<P>In Winter 1991, the locals in Vilnius, Tallinn, and Riga constructed
<BR>
barricades around their government buildings, to protect the
<BR>
buildings and people, with cement blocks, brick, barbed wire, piles
<BR>
of stones, anything, and then created human barricades of people
<BR>
around that, those people armed mostly with sticks (most didn't own
<BR>
weapons anyway). It made quite a picture! Of course they knew that a
<BR>
tank would flatten them (and some in Vilnius in those human
<BR>
barricades did get shot by the Soviet OMON), so their resistance was
<BR>
mostly symbolic. And if you saw the graffiti painted on those
<BR>
barricades (I took photos when I was in Tallinn and Riga a few
<BR>
months later), 50% of the graffiti was written in English, aimed at
<BR>
the Western journalists. The &quot;show&quot; was really successful though, both
<BR>
for fostering more unity and strength among the Baltic people
<BR>
themselves (people from all areas of life participated in those
<BR>
vigils), and for showing the rest of the world that they were quite
<BR>
determined and serious after 50 years of being stomped on, that
<BR>
they were going to be free.
