<EM>&gt; &gt; collect every stupid thing that person ever posted, ever, by searching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thru achives, etc.  Does this change the way we post?  spike

<EM>&gt; I was more boisterous and silly in some of my Usenet posts before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advent of Dejanews.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm.  My earliest technical papers were formal and wooden.  Later
<BR>
ones were... boisterouser.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>Let me try another angle.  As someone pointed out, they are careful
<BR>
to never post anything that might become illegal at any time in the future.
<BR>
This is exactly what might help defeat tyranny.  Any government can seize
<BR>
only those powers which *we allow to be seized*.  If the masses lack
<BR>
foresight and a large percentage post that which might eventually
<BR>
become illegal, it provides the motive for those masses to prevent
<BR>
the government from making any form of speech or attitude illegal.  Right?
<BR>
<P>The embarrassing stuff we posted long ago might eventually
<BR>
serve as a harmless way to burn off excess dignity.  Please,
<BR>
Eliezer, that dinosaur.die.die thing, you mentioned that before
<BR>
in that same context.  I admit being outta touch with current
<BR>
pop culture, not hip nor groovy.  What is dinosaur.die.die and
<BR>
why should it cause you embarrassment?  BTW, I too attempted
<BR>
a novel from when I was 11, which I disposed of.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>Each of us remembers the most embarrassing moment of our lives.
<BR>
For me it was when I was nearly lynched for saying Peace Eagles.
<BR>
But no one else remembers those moments!  For me, there were
<BR>
300 persons present, and none of them I asked 12 yrs later recalled
<BR>
the incident, or if so only vaguely.
<BR>
<P>Afterwards I was ranting to a friend about that incident.  She
<BR>
listened to my sad tale finally said:  Show me where you are hurt.
<BR>
Me:  Excuse me?  She:  Show me where it hurts that you were
<BR>
embarrassed.  Show me the booboo and Ill kiss it better.  Where
<BR>
exactly are you hurting?
<BR>
<P>So I grokked.  I was whining over something that doesnt hurt.  So
<BR>
be embarrassed!  It wont hurt us.  Its like our parents making home
<BR>
movies of us frolicking naked in the sprinkler when we were 3,
<BR>
embarrassing but harmless.  And if we post something that may
<BR>
later be illegal, so be it.  We will fight tyranny all the harder. spike
