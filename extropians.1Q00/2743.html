It appears as if Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Nirvana&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002141306.OAA21095@color.sics.se&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt; wrote:

<P>Perhaps James Wetterau &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jwjr@ignition.name.net?Subject=Re:%20Nirvana&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002141306.OAA21095@color.sics.se&gt;">jwjr@ignition.name.net</A>&gt; wrote:

|That song is by George Harrison, not John Lennon.  Harrison's music

<BR>

<P>Maybe Michael M. Butler &lt;<A HREF="mailto:butler@comp-lib.org?Subject=Re:%20Nirvana&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002141306.OAA21095@color.sics.se&gt;">butler@comp-lib.org</A>&gt; wrote:

|The lyrics are from a different song on the same album, I think.
<BR>
<P>The 1991 Compact Disk ``Living In The Material World'' which contains the
<BR>
song ``Give Me Love'' (a.k.a. ``Give Me Peace On Earth'' which started this
<BR>
thread) does not mention the Chiffon's nor any lyrics author except for
<BR>
George Harrison.
<BR>
<P>One may thus assume that lawyers have been fed, and the lawsuit(s) settled.

Let us now leave this thread to gather dust in the extropian archive vaults.
