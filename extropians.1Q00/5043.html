<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is one thing to hold the opinion that infinitely copiable memespace

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Assumption check: Who says memespace is infinte? In a finite universe, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a limited amount of memespace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; should be fenced off and privately held the same way as uncopyable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; dirtspace, but it is quite another to continue claiming that those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; oppose the former also oppose the latter when you know that's not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; memescapes and landscapes are equal to me. I am equally comfortable living in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the land of ideas as I am living in concrete reality. This is one reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even extropians have let the socialist statists at ICANN steal the whole kit and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kaboodle out from under us. Since eventually that is where most of us will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; living one day, failing to see memespace as real estate is a serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; miscalculation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are once again confusing two separate things--namespaces such as those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; administered by ICANN and Trademark law (and which are indeed uncopiable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scarce resources like land, and which I have always supported property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights in), and Patents, which were the subject of this thread.  Come back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this debate when you understand the difference and can stay on-topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm trying to, however some people here are dismissing all intellectual
<BR>
property, while you are discriminating between types.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A piece of fish, and the lake from which I fish are singular scarce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources; if you use them, you lessen what I can use.   The name &quot;Joe's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quality Fish&quot; is a scarce and valuable resource.  If you use that name,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you commit fraud by pretending to be me and you lessen the value that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name has to my customers.  My _method_ of fishing is different.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; watch me fish on my lake, then copy what I do on your own lake and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sell your own fish under your own name, you are not stealing my fish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or my name, you are just competing in a market I created, and our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respective customers will decide who is better.  Just because I created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market doesn't give me any right to muscle out my competitors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats a disengenuous argument. Say I create a new type of fishing reel.
<BR>
I make them. Someone buys my fishing reel under my license to them not
<BR>
to copy it. That someone's fishing buddy sees how the reel works, and
<BR>
decides to manufacture the same reel, however since he doesn't have to
<BR>
pay the amortized costs of my research and development, he can underbid
<BR>
me in the market, and drives me out of business. Thats how your
<BR>
patentless society would work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Patents and copyrights pretend to protect &quot;property rights&quot; in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space of ideas and expressions; what they really protect is the _market_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for products based on those ideas.  If the government stepped in to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grant a monopoly market to an apple farmer, shutting down farmers who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grew their own apples on their own land, we would rightly call that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; act of force.  I don't see any reason to change that opinion just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because farmer A &quot;invented&quot; apple farming by doing it first.
</EM><BR>
<P>If a farmer invented a new type of apple, and spent $1 billion
<BR>
researching and developing it, yet his neigbors felt that it was
<BR>
perfectly ok to buy one of his apples at market, extract its DNA, and
<BR>
start growing the same apples themselves, but since they don't have the
<BR>
cost of the research and development that the first farmer did, they can
<BR>
run him out of business. They don't even have to buy an apple, just go
<BR>
to the dump and pick up a discarded apple core. The property rights
<BR>
extend to the added value of the investment of research and development
<BR>
into the new idea, which is why patent rights are temporary, so that the
<BR>
inventor can recoupe the investment in R&amp;D, before it becomes fair game
<BR>
for the open market.
