<P>
In the early '70s I did a project like this for my biology senior thesis at
<BR>
UCSC.  It was a time when it looked like we would need a replacement for oil
<BR>
within 20 years.  I saw it as a two part system in which algae would be grown in
<BR>
ponds, and then pumped into tanks that contained digestive bacteria that would
<BR>
&quot;eat&quot; them.  I built an apparatus that used two big jugs with turbidity feedback
<BR>
pumps (photocells across the vinyl tubing) between them.  So, as the algae grew
<BR>
under the lights, the pump diverted enough of it to keep the population somewhat
<BR>
constant, and the digestive bacteria (in a jug covered by foil) stayed at a
<BR>
population limited by the rate of food source.
<BR>
<P>The photosynthetic side of this system produced oxygen, which bubbled out on that
<BR>
side, and the dark side produced a combination of methane and hydrogen.  What is
<BR>
being done today at Berkeley is better than what I did because they use just one
<BR>
organism, that is not broken down on the dark side.  Thus, they do not have to
<BR>
waste energy rebuilding on the light side.
<BR>
<P>However, I suspect they will run into some of the problems I did (not counting
<BR>
making all the pumps work, which was a nightmare before embedded processors).
<BR>
One of which was getting the oxygen out of the soup that goes into the dark.  If
<BR>
you do not get rid of it, the dark side will use it, and you will get less
<BR>
product (they also have to get rid of the sulfur too).  The flip side is that the
<BR>
ph drops on the dark side, and you do not want to pump a lot of acid over to the
<BR>
photosynthetic side, where it slows down growth.
<BR>
<P>I found that it was possible to take care of both of these &quot;problems&quot; by passing
<BR>
the solutions to and from the dark side through half cells with platinum
<BR>
electrodes.  The result was that the low ph on one side (think of it as protons
<BR>
in solution) would combine with the oxygen on the other to produce electricity
<BR>
and water.  So, I got electricity and methane from the system, until I ran into
<BR>
the typical electrode fouling problems.  I could have kept going (sonicated
<BR>
electrodes, etc.), but I did enough to satisfy my advisor, and I wanted out, so
<BR>
that was it, my contribution to biomass techniques.
<BR>
<P>All biomass techniques have one basic problem, cheap oil and natural gas.  In the
<BR>
project above, I argued that the fact that bio conversion of solar power is low
<BR>
efficiency is not important if you can get the system to build itself, so the
<BR>
overall cost per kwatt-hr is low.  This is still true, but the cost of
<BR>
photovoltaic energy is dropping fast, and nanotechnology is going to give us
<BR>
photovoltaic systems that have high efficiency, and low cost because they *will*
<BR>
build themselves.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line: Been there, done that, works fine, won't be cost effective.

<EM>&gt; &gt; BERKELEY-- A metabolic switch that triggers algae to turn sunlight into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  large quantities of hydrogen gas, a valuable fuel, is the subject of a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  discovery reported for the first time by University of California,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Berkeley,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  scientists and their Colorado colleagues. The news appears in this month's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  issue of the journal &quot;Plant Physiology.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EvMick-yes I read and enjoyed the article myself yesterday. One of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frowners, though, was the expectation, that &quot;perhaps in 20 years this will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fuel that powers civilization..&quot;  Look, you're a fellow of enough age to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have read  a few Weekly Readers, and Popular Mechanics in your time. So you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that when energy scientists speak of an energy technology being &quot;20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years away&quot; that they are blowing smoke and begging for more research grants!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Please remember:&quot; Z-pinch Fusion is 20 years away! Solar power is 20 Years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away! Muon Catalyzed Fusion is only 20 years away!  Commercial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles are only 20 years away! Laser Fusion is only 20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years away! Solar Power Satalites are only 20 years away!  I don't regret the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money spent on research-only I don't like being lied to, by these scientists.
