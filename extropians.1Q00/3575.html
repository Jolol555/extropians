<P>
I stand by my assertion that Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple 
<BR>
Intelligences is NOT a commie plot to denigrate the values of the most widely 
<BR>
accepted two kinds of intelligence: verbal/linguistic and 
<BR>
logical/mathematical, but an encouragement to teachers. It is actually 
<BR>
helping kids to learn more, learn faster, and have fun while learning. 
<BR>
Teachers are challenged to find new inputs -- or ways to teach.
<BR>
<P>In practice the seven Intelligences are not separate but integrated in unique 
<BR>
combinations as one intelligence that shapes the mind body and intellect.
<BR>
<P>Educational systems are applying the theory with success. The new curriculum 
<BR>
integrates many successful teaching and learning strategies. More and more 
<BR>
students are finding ways to be successful at learning. Why would you 
<BR>
begrudge another person learning in a way that works for them, if they are 
<BR>
not showing aptitude for your rigid style of learning? 
<BR>
<P>The other ways which *other* children, those not alwyas gifted at those two 
<BR>
primary styles of learning include visual/spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, 
<BR>
musical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligence. When combinations of 
<BR>
these &quot;inputs&quot; are stimulated in the child's &quot;learning centers&quot;, children who 
<BR>
may be failing at core subjects tend to improve radically.
<BR>
<P>Of course I am assuming that the people who pooped on this theory knew what 
<BR>
it actually about, but I suspect neither Mike not Mick have read his book, 
<BR>
'Frames of Mind', but are reacting to something they heard on a conservative 
<BR>
talk show or in a discussion with like-minded, liberal hating people.
<BR>
<P>QM
<BR>
<P>PS:
<BR>
Bruce Campbell has illustrated some of the concrete ways in which children 
<BR>
are being taught in this fashion in an abridged lesson plan below: 
<BR>
( All children find these fun and easy, but certain ones resonate more 
<BR>
depending on the child's stimulation &quot;centers&quot;.).
<BR>
<P>For spatial children, students constructed a three layer replica of the earth 
<BR>
with three
<BR>
colors of clay to represent the core, the mantle and the crust. They sliced 
<BR>
their clay earths in half for a cross-section view. 
<BR>
<P>For math children, geometric concepts of concentric circles, radius, 
<BR>
diameter, etc. 
<BR>
<P>Children for whom reading is easy: might read a story called &quot;The Magic 
<BR>
School Bus&quot; that depicted a group of school children exploring the inside of 
<BR>
the earth. 
<BR>
For musically or &quot;orally&quot; gifted, a listening/spelling activity. The students 
<BR>
listened to music while studying spelling words such as earth, crust, mantle 
<BR>
and core. 
<BR>
&nbsp;For visual arts children, they cut concentric circles of different sizes and 
<BR>
colors, pasting and labeling them to identify the different zones. 
<BR>
<P>Children who find interpersonal a talent, learn cooperative learning activity 
<BR>
where the students might read a fact sheet on the earth and jointly answer 
<BR>
questions or a creative fantasy &quot;Things you would take with you on a journey 
<BR>
to the center of the earth.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>At the end, all the students knew the structure of the earth, and perhaps 
<BR>
even more importantly, had learned artistically, mathematically, musically, 
<BR>
linguistically, kinesthetically, interpersonally and independently. The role 
<BR>
of the teacher dramatically shifts as the students work at their multiple 
<BR>
centers. (Bruce Campbell)
