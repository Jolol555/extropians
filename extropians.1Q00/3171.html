<EM>&gt;&gt;Arghh..where to continue? Consider that at least several other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;manufacturers of Intel-compatible chips exist. AMD, obviously. But also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Cyrix/National/Via, and Texas Instruments, and IBM. Did all of them  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;design in the &quot;special NSA sections&quot;? Without any of them talking?
</EM><BR>
(And these are only the recent deals. In the past, Matra/Harris, a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;French-affiliated company, was a producer. Ditto for a bunch of others, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;American, European, and Asian. All of them in on the conspiracy?)

As a paranoid theory, it's not even interesting.

<P>On the other hand, some years ago - early 90's - I was giving lectures on 
<BR>
the future of computing and virtual reality.  I predicted in detail both in 
<BR>
my talks and in print in an article in Amiga User Internationale that 
<BR>
passive transponder ID chips would become ubiquitous around now, eventually 
<BR>
allowing for &quot;I-Glasses&quot; style HUDs to run a continuous &quot;overlaid reality&quot; 
<BR>
based on accessing web databases keyed to unique identifier codes in the 
<BR>
chips.  At that point, the chips were slightly under a dollar in bulk and up 
<BR>
to 256 bytes in their return chirp.  In practical terms that meant that the 
<BR>
city of San Jose could afford to put Indala Coporation's chips in all the 
<BR>
city garbage cans and that, in theory, you could put unique identifiers on 
<BR>
every piece of significant property on the planet, down to thumb tacks and 
<BR>
paper clips.
<BR>
That was a decade ago, approximately.  Today I got a cute little notpad, 
<BR>
calculator, memobook, address/phone book, calculator in the mail for 
<BR>
subscribing to a cheap magazine.  It occurred to me to wonder what else was 
<BR>
molded into the plastic????  At the price, it would be extremely cheap 
<BR>
surveilance tech to put these tiny chips into all kinds of stuff - they can 
<BR>
be injected into pets or molded into plastic, and I don't know of any law 
<BR>
that requires informing anyone - me or the magazine publisher.  Then all you 
<BR>
have to do is match one of them to an individual and by scattering the 
<BR>
readers around public areas where everyone passes....
