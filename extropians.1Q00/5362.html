<EM>&gt; The problem with this discussion, perhaps, is carelessness with
</EM><BR>
terminology.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree 100% that the US is &quot;interventionist.&quot;  I don't think *anyone*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; denies that.  But &quot;interventionism&quot; and &quot;imperialism&quot; are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interchangeable terms.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree here.  But I would add that if one constantly intervenes, one
<BR>
is imperializing.  The US intervention in WW1, e.g., was a mere
<BR>
intervention.  The US came in on the Anglo-French side in the conflict, but
<BR>
did not stay after the war was over and there was over two decades of US
<BR>
non-involvement in the region.  (However, during this period of
<BR>
&quot;isolationism&quot; by today's standards, the US did interefere in the affairs of
<BR>
many a Latin American nation and was fighting an insurrection in the
<BR>
Phillipines.  So, it's more like the isolationism of the 1920s and 1930s was
<BR>
in regards to Europe -- not the whole world.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the thrust of your position is that the US should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let the pendulum swing back a bit toward isolationism, I might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily disagree (although I have not fully considered the issue as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has not specifically been raised in this thread).  But regardless of
</EM><BR>
whether
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or not you are a fan of US foreign policy the plain fact is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;imperialism&quot; is an untrue, unfair and perjorative description of US
</EM><BR>
policy.
<BR>
<P>The rumors are untrue.  US foreign policy has hardly every been
<BR>
isolationist, especially from Spanish American war on.  Surely, on a
<BR>
comparative scale, the US in the 19th century had few treaties and was not
<BR>
involved in a lot of far off wars.  That's perhaps the closest the US came
<BR>
to isolationism in its history.
<BR>
<P>Also, I don't imperialism is an unfair charge, if we stick to the definition
<BR>
I offered several posts ago -- controlling another nation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are not actually claiming that non-US citizens are more informed about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US foreign policy than Americans, are you?  If you are, I must beg to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differ.  Freedom of the press is one of our most cherished rights, and our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; press is not shy in the least about putting Government policy (foreign or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise) in a less than flattering light.
</EM><BR>
<P>This statement is good for the high school civics class, but the real world
<BR>
is different.  Yes, the US has freedom of expression almost unprecedented
<BR>
elsewhere -- except when it comes to pornography or funding political
<BR>
campaigns.:)  But Americans generally don't see the effect of US foreign
<BR>
policy and the things they do see from the major news organizations,
<BR>
including NPR and PBS, are usually tailored for specific responses.  Sadly,
<BR>
most TV and radio new programs and newspapers in the US, tend to accept the
<BR>
State Department's press releases as news items and the final word on the
<BR>
subject.
<BR>
<P>Witness how little Media criticism there was of the Persian Gulf War, the
<BR>
continued bombing of Iraq, and the recent NATO attack on Serbia.  In fact,
<BR>
aside from some of the libertarian print Media (e.g., _Liberty_, which is an
<BR>
opinion magazine NOT a news journal), which is so small it's almost a joke,
<BR>
the only major new outlet that had a critical line toward the latter two
<BR>
happenings (the bombings of Iraq and Serbia) was WBAI, which is extremely
<BR>
marginal.  Even NPR and PBS -- which are, sad to say, the best of the breed
<BR>
of mainstream news -- either ignored (in the case of Iraq) or cheerleaded on
<BR>
(in the case of Serbia) the attacks.
<BR>
<P>WBAI not only interviewed people from the other side, but had on historians
<BR>
and journalists who worked on the Balkans for years if not decades.
<BR>
Granted, a lot of this was slanted to be pro-Serbia, but it was refreshing
<BR>
to hear a real alternative.  And that one was, to my knowledge, the only
<BR>
alternative that could reach a large audience -- and then it was only a
<BR>
radio audience and not one available everywhere.  (Some WBAI affiliates are
<BR>
in a very precarious financial and legal situation.  The FCC is seeking to
<BR>
revoke some of their licenses.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is called foreign policy.  It's using your clout (political,
</EM><BR>
economic,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or military) to induce your neighbors to act in your best interest.
</EM><BR>
*Every*
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nation does it (or tries, or wants to do it).  But since the US has the
</EM><BR>
most
<BR>
<EM>&gt; clout it is usually the most successful at having other nations comply
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; its wishes.  Again, like it or no, this simply is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that it's natural to use foreign policy tools to &quot;induce your
<BR>
neighbors to act in your best interest.&quot;  This is the way of the world and I
<BR>
don't think our discussion is going to change that.  However, what is called
<BR>
the &quot;best interest&quot; of any nation is usually NOT that nation's best
<BR>
interest, but the interest of whatever small group has the reigns of the
<BR>
foreign policy power at that time.  Thus, we see, the recent bombings of the
<BR>
Sudan and Afghanistan -- to get some exiled Saudi terrorist -- were
<BR>
uncannily done when the President was down in the polls.  I don't think it
<BR>
was in the interest of the American people to bomb those places.  It,
<BR>
however, did appear to be in the interest of one man who had some popularity
<BR>
problems at the time.
<BR>
<P>I would go further to say that it is also NOT in the best interest of any
<BR>
nation to promote the use of force, which is 90% of the US foreign policy
<BR>
tool kit, to settle disputes.  That's a very short range policy.  It only
<BR>
works as long as one is powerful enough to enforce one's views on everyone
<BR>
else.  The lesson it teaches one's neighbors is &quot;might makes right.&quot;  And
<BR>
history is full of examples of hegemons and imperial powers basically
<BR>
creating their own enemies.  Much better to spread the rule of law or, at
<BR>
least, not to always get one's way because one's neighbors are also
<BR>
powerful, then to succeed so well that there's no respect for the rule or
<BR>
law and no allies to turn to.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
