Actually, the engine would do well on a recumbent, and probably for long 
<BR>
trips you'd have somewhere to store extra batteries (my are they ever 
<BR>
heavy!).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>All this talk of recumbents is making me excited!!  I don't have a car and 
<BR>
so must get around by bicycle, bus or rides from friends.  My problem is 
<BR>
that because I live in Anchorage, Alaska I cannot ride a bike year-round.  A 
<BR>
few do but I consider doing that borderline suicidal behavior.
<BR>
<P>The $800 pricetag is steep but possible for me.  How much more is an engine 
<BR>
for it?  So it is not considered a motor vehicle even with an engine? Wow!
<BR>
<P>I have played with the idea of relocating and then using a bicycle 
<BR>
year-round for transportation.  The recumbent with an engine sounds perfect. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is not a threat to a man's sexual anatomy either! lol
<BR>
<P>To increase visibility, why not put up a couple of racing flags on either 
<BR>
side of the bike, front and back?
<BR>
<P>I am going to have to learn if this type of bike is sold in Anchorage.  Can 
<BR>
a person do crosscountry touring on one of these?  I could ride down the 
<BR>
Alcan with it! lol!!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
