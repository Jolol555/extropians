EvMick proposes a &quot;cold' engine (opposite of a heat engine):
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How about if we go about it backwards?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How much &quot;Coldth&quot; can be concentrated in a mobile source?  Is a solid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen brick possible?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assume it is (or something like it).....could usable amounts of electricity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be developed using &quot;thermocouple technology&quot;?  Or merely by letting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen boil off and powering &quot;steam&quot; engines?
</EM><BR>
<P>You could probably do something like this, give a car a reservoir of something
<BR>
cold and run an engine off the heat differential.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that hot and cold objects by themselves don't store much
<BR>
energy compared to what we can get with chemical reactions.  That's why
<BR>
your car runs on gas rather than by being loaded with hot bricks.
<BR>
<P>When you're trying to diet, you learn that protein and carbohydrates have
<BR>
5 Calories per gram, and fat has 9 Calories per gram.  Gasoline, according
<BR>
to my reference, has about 11 Calories per gram.
<BR>
<P>That's enough to heat a gram of water 5000, 9000, and 11000 degrees
<BR>
respectively!  So to have the same energy storage capacity as a fuel
<BR>
as energetic as food, you'd have to have a heat reservoir stored at
<BR>
thousands of degrees, which is not very practical (or safe).
<BR>
<P>Or to get the same effect with cold, it would have to be thousands of
<BR>
degrees below zero, which you can't do because it doesn't get that cold.
<BR>
<P>Chemical energy is really amazingly efficient.  Other energy storage
<BR>
systems have been proposed; springs, flywheels, etc., mostly because they
<BR>
might be more efficient at feeding energy in and then getting it out.
<BR>
But if you just want the one-way process to be efficient and portable,
<BR>
chemicals are the way to go.
