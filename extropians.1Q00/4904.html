Zero Powers said (as others have said before)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;However, I do take issue with posts such as yours which attempt to limit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;field of discussion on this list.  Censorship, or anything like it, has no
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;place in an extropian world.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my opinion, asking people to discuss a particular topic (which many
<BR>
people, myself included, feel has little or nothing to do with this forum)
<BR>
elsewhere is not by any means censorship. This list has a purpose, which I
<BR>
will not try to define, but it DOES have one.
<BR>
<P>I don't think it is Censorship if the Alpahville Daily Gazette refuses to
<BR>
run stories about the happenings in Betatown. Those stories have a forum of
<BR>
their own. If the editors of A.D.G. or anyone else were to call up the
<BR>
Betatown Weekly Press and demand that they stop printing their fine
<BR>
publication, THAT would be Censorship with a capital C.
<BR>
<P>To label as censorship the suggestion that the guns topic find another forum
<BR>
is a gross exaggeration.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to this recurring problem, along with a decline in threads of
<BR>
personal interest to me, I'm off to Unsubscribe!
<BR>
<P>(Ok, I realize that as someone whom almost never contributes anything to
<BR>
this list, I can't really complain about it's content.. but I'm off
<BR>
nonetheless :)
<BR>
<P>ta-ta, adeiu, etc., etc,
<BR>
Best wishes,
<BR>
