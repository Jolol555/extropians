I just finished listening to an audio book by Clive Cussler...I beleive it 
<BR>
was his latest.
<BR>
<P>I'm not recommending it but there were a few items of interest.  
<BR>
Nanotechnology was mentioned as was genetic engineering.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the WAY that they were mentioned was all that great.  But 
<BR>
hey....Clive Cussler isn't an SF author....he just writes shoot em up bang 
<BR>
bang.
<BR>
<P>Er....maybe that's the point.  Two new items of cutting edge tech is rising 
<BR>
on the popular radar screen.
<BR>
<P>One other item in the book that bothered me.  I've heard it mentioned by 
<BR>
&quot;gloom and doom&quot; types on radio and I've pretty much discounted it.  The idea 
<BR>
is that were the Ross Ice Shelf in Antartica to be released so that it went 
<BR>
floating off it would destabilize the earths rotation with ugly results.... 
<BR>
Kinda like a tire out of balance.
<BR>
<P>My feeling is that the mass disparity is too great.  The  mass of the 
<BR>
Antartic Ice in comparison to the mass of the earth is less than comparing  a 
<BR>
pebble in the tread of one of my trucktires......no big deal....and besides 
<BR>
my autobalancers would compenstate...as would the ocean compensate...
