An interesting article titled &quot;China Bets Farm on Promise (and Glory)
<BR>
of Genetic Engineering -- Large population needs food sources, research
<BR>
stressed&quot; appeared in today's (March 29) Wall Street Journal.  Sorry,
<BR>
no URL.
<BR>
<P>As the title implies, China is encouraging GM crop research and use
<BR>
because some see an opportunity for scientific recognition, though
<BR>
mostly because more food is needed (growing population, increased
<BR>
demand for meat and dairy) and less arable land is available due to
<BR>
various degrees of desertification and pests.  Apparently the northern
<BR>
Chinese cotton harvest suffered a severe decline a few years ago due to
<BR>
pests and is back in full swing due to the use of GM cotton.  According
<BR>
to anecdotes contained in the article, farmers, consumers, and
<BR>
government officials all swear by GM crops, in stark contrast to
<BR>
western protests.
<BR>
<P>While the WSJ article didn't mention it, I've also been reading
<BR>
(articles in New Scientist, again, I can't find URLs) and hearing (from
<BR>
people who have visited China recently) that atmospheric pollution is
<BR>
becoming a major agricultural problem.  Supposedly smog is dense and
<BR>
pervasive even in the countryside to the extent that crops are
<BR>
suffering from decreased sunlight.  One striking passage claimed that
<BR>
in Shenyang (I believe the largest Chinese city north of Beijing, in
<BR>
China's northeastern &quot;rust belt&quot;) snow is black before it hits the
<BR>
ground due to atmospheric coal dust.
