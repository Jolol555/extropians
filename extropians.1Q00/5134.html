<P>I have thought about this for some time, and wrote about it on sci.nano a few
<BR>
years ago.  I believe that there are some researchers working on it.  Josh Hall
<BR>
noted that in order to have a lift capability better than hydrogen, a vacuum
<BR>
flotation diamondoid shell a meter in diameter would have a thickness of only
<BR>
about a micron.  Some implosion stability was questioned.
<BR>
<P>I became interested in this subject, not for vacuum replacement of simple
<BR>
balloons, but because it leads to the possibility of designing stratospheric
<BR>
stations that are &quot;ships of the sky.&quot;  This is a very large paraboloid structure
<BR>
that floats in the high atmosphere the way a boat floats on water.  Just like an
<BR>
ocean going ship, the hull gets thinner as you  go to higher altitude (lower
<BR>
pressure).  The top edges of the structure are molecularly thin, at distances
<BR>
from earth where the pressure is in the millitorr range.  Being open to space, it
<BR>
makes a nice place to put observatories, or mass drivers that are going to throw
<BR>
things up to a space hook.  However, being open, it will always have a flow of
<BR>
molecules falling down from the edges that need to be pumped out by the &quot;bilge&quot;
<BR>
turbopumps (solar powered).
<BR>
<P>Here is a thought experiment to explore this.  Suppose you could build a giant
<BR>
steel disk in space and lower it toward the earth.  This disk is so big that the
<BR>
edges are still out in space when the center encounters the curvature of the
<BR>
atmosphere.  Suppose this disk is 52 cm thick at the center.  Steel has a density
<BR>
of 7.85 g/cm^3, so (close to the earth) the weight of the disk at the center is
<BR>
about 4 N/cm^2.  Well, the pressure of air is about 4 N/cm^2 at an altitude of
<BR>
5000 meters.  This means that the weight of the disk is supported by the pressure
<BR>
of the air below it.  As we move from the center of the disk to the outer edge,
<BR>
the disk would be made thinner (thus lighter) because the altitude of the point
<BR>
is higher in the atmosphere until we get to the edge of space.  This can only be
<BR>
a thought experiment because at some point you cannot make the steel any thinner
<BR>
and air would rush in, and as you move away from the center the resultant vector
<BR>
of pressure is no longer normal to the disk, creating stress.  However, the
<BR>
interesting part is that there is no stress on the central, heaviest area of the
<BR>
structure, so almost any construction material would work (thickness adjusted for
<BR>
density).
<BR>
<P>By changing the shape from a disk to a paraboloid (more like a boat), the
<BR>
structure can be made smaller while still getting the edges out to an area of
<BR>
micropressure.  The first tradeoff is that now the central part of the structure
<BR>
must sustain hoop stress (as does the hull of an ocean ship), and hold up the
<BR>
weight of the extending edges, but with nanotech materials this starts to look
<BR>
very attractive.  The second tradeoff is that structures that do not extend so
<BR>
far mean less weight (less stress on materials), but then more molecules fall in
<BR>
per second and the turbo pumps need to work harder.  I am interested in designs
<BR>
that start at about 20000 m  above the earth, so they can be serviced by a
<BR>
conventional balloon, but then give access to space.
<BR>
<P>The trick is to be able to build (grow) the station in place.  I envision a
<BR>
structure that is many km in diameter, and (although made of nanotubes) is so
<BR>
fragile that it could not be made anywhere on earth, or survive retro
<BR>
acceleration descending from orbit.  It is a project on my back burner, and may
<BR>
never be practical in the sky of earth, but is interesting for places such as
<BR>
Venus.
