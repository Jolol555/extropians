<P>As a hopeful inventor can someone explain to me why patents are considered bad?
<BR>
In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from their hard won

intellectual efforts? Is intellectual property worth less because it springs

sometimes so easily from the creative mind? Perhaps only manual labor is

considered of any value. Maybe I should tell my plumber I'm against paying for
<BR>
his unique efforts and he should create an unleaky faucet for me for free?
