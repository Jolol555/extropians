<P>
Please excuse the hurried nature of this post.
<BR>
<P>I am not even half-way through my choked in-box this morning and am growing 
<BR>
sick and tired of the high-volume tit-for-tat schoolyard need a small number 
<BR>
of posters seem to feel to drag out a thread far beyond any great interest to 
<BR>
the majority of our subscribers.  Yes, gun issues are important, but the way 
<BR>
in which this ONE issue can explode into one that dominates list traffic is 
<BR>
absurd and damaging to the &quot;commons&quot; of our shared discussion space here.
<BR>
<P>I have had off-list requests to re-impose a temporary moratorium on the 
<BR>
subject as we did last year.  I've seen the rationales each of the 
<BR>
high-volume posters offer for their felt need to respond to each and every 
<BR>
post and to use hypertrophied rhetoric and, personally, I'm not convinced.  
<BR>
Making one's point is a value that has to be balanced against the interest of 
<BR>
maintaining the over-all quality of the list.  I also believe there is value 
<BR>
in the &quot;to each her own killfile&quot; argument against any control over list 
<BR>
content.  While I find that position more persuasive, I believe that ExI's 
<BR>
interest in maintaining a generally valuable discussion forum, especially to 
<BR>
relative newcomers to transhumanism and extropianism, must be weighed against 
<BR>
that argument.
<BR>
<P>If the small number of people who keep the gun argument going at a volume out 
<BR>
of proportion to its relative value can't exercise a little self-restraint, 
<BR>
another moratorium is a real possibility.  I know there are people whose 
<BR>
opinions I deeply respect who will disagree strongly with any such action, 
<BR>
and I'm sorry.  But the way this one subject causes an absurd inflation of 
<BR>
the number of messages and degrades the quality of discussion is something 
<BR>
that needs some temporary, minimal corrective action if a few people can't 
<BR>
exercise some common sense.
