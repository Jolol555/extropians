<P><EM> &gt; We've already discussed ways to prevent namespace pollution and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; usurpation, but implementing those will have to wait for version 2.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're part of the effort? Cool. Wonder why you never plugged the
<BR>
project here. It's certainly worth it. (People please don't try to put
<BR>
it on /., because it's recently already made memepool despite being
<BR>
early beta. Please please don't try to rush things at this stage).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Specifically, if you store data keyed on content hash, and store
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;names&quot; as cryptographically signed references to content-hash-keyed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; data, you can have any number of namespaces, each secure and reliable,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; which users can choose among.
</EM><BR>
<P>Providing unconstrained number of namespaces is great, but it invites
<BR>
namespace inflation. Figaro.here, figaro.there,
<BR>
figaro.friggin.everywhere. (Sounds familiar, huh?).  Then things
<BR>
become hard to find, unless you can do global name searches, which
<BR>
makes you once again susceptible to the attack via namespace
<BR>
clobbering. If lock on names persists as long as there are references
<BR>
to it (how to prevent graph loops? or do only actual document accesses
<BR>
count as reference?  they have to be. references can be fabricated by
<BR>
robots, however, which you can't tell apart from humans), then you can
<BR>
fill up the sensible stringspace with garbage, and keep them locked by
<BR>
running a lot of robots. Ugh.
<BR>
<P>Of course user communities can rendezvous at secret points in
<BR>
namespace. Which is only good as it stays a secret.
<BR>
<P>One needs anonymous cryptographic authentication, and some
<BR>
infrastructure allowing content ranking, which can't be defeated by
<BR>
distributed robots generating thousands of hits. Robots cannot build
<BR>
reputation, and if they can, they should enjoy the same rights,
<BR>
anyway.
<BR>
<P>Building communities, with quantitative trust metrics. Good thing you
<BR>
can't trace a virtual reputation to a warm body, somewhere...
<BR>
<P>If there is a means of revoking content, a trusted person could fill
<BR>
up a local namespace with lightweight dummies, which can get
<BR>
substituted by real content when contacted by the author. But this
<BR>
means you have to use nym remailers, which exposes you to spam. And
<BR>
even dummies take up resources, if there are a lot of them. Hmm.
<BR>
<P>The whole thing is obviously impossible to be made waterproof. As long 
<BR>
as it keeps the most glaring holes patched, and is usable, however...
