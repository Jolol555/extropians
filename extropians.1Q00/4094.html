</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and other wealthy people) competitive pressures drive actuaries to work their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculations to the edge of profitability.  Thus, I find your statement above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be wrong: Any attempt by one life insurance company to overstate mortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rates will be quickly exploited by competitors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Greg I think we are saying the same thing: that insurance companies know
<BR>
a great deal about the true mortality of us, however it is not in their
<BR>
best interest that *we* know the true mortality of us.
<BR>
<P>When we buy insurance, we are betting (in a sense) that we will die,
<BR>
and the insurance company is betting that we wont.  They are holding
<BR>
all the cards here, controlling the information.  I dont doubt that their
<BR>
profit margins are razor thin, and that they actually take a loss on a
<BR>
large percentage of their clients.  We could better estimate our true
<BR>
mortality by inspecting the price matrix of life insurance.  spike
