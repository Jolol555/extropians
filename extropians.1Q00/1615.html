Below is the response I posted to the article at infidels.org:
<BR>
<P>------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>The view on death that James Still expresses in his article, 
<BR>
&quot;Death Is Not an Event in Life&quot;, seems to me as fanciful and 
<BR>
counterproductive as the &quot;life after death&quot; myths that he 
<BR>
mentions.  
<BR>
<P>We progress by overcoming our limitations, not by &quot;accepting&quot; 
<BR>
them, or rationalizing them away with wishful thinking or 
<BR>
convoluted self-delusion.  
<BR>
<P>Where would we be if we just accepted helplessness in the face of 
<BR>
diseases, instead of looking for cures? Where would we be if we 
<BR>
just accepted that we can't fly, instead of creating airplanes? 
<BR>
Where would we be if we just accepted our ignorance about the 
<BR>
cosmos, instead of studying it?  
<BR>
<P>&quot;death is not an event in life . . . our life has no end in just 
<BR>
the way in which our visual field has no limits.&quot; is just a 
<BR>
thinly disguised &quot;I can't&quot;. A poor excuse to not rise to the 
<BR>
challenge that presents itself to us. There is no reason to 
<BR>
believe that the challenge of death cannot be overcome just like 
<BR>
countless others before it.  
<BR>
<P>You can wish it away if that makes you feel better, but the loss 
<BR>
of a human life _is_ a tragedy. There was a time, not long ago, 
<BR>
when no one had ever travelled beyond the earth's atmosphere. 
<BR>
That no one has lived much beyond a century is no more reason to 
<BR>
accept the inevitability of death than our lack of wings is  
<BR>
reason to accept the inevitability of not being able to fly.
<BR>
<P><P><PRE>

                                        Peace,
                                        William Kitchen
<P>The future is ours to create.
</PRE>
