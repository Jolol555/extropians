<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ABSTRACT:  What daring 21st century concepts or projects would you most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like to see pursued, if money were no object?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [ ... the idea of funding very large scale projects through private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philanthropy ..  ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EXAMPLES:  might include the immense energy tower that some Texas and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Israeli researchers proposed for desert regions, drawing both moisture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wind power from high-level air flows...  or how about funding the solar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sail tests that NASA (for some reason) has delayed for thirty years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potentially letting even high schools send cameras to Mars?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or consider the following;  With the $25 Billion that Sam Walton left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just five people, he could instead have funded a manned mission to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mars!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In exchange, how could the International Astronautical Union refuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rename the moon Deimos &quot;Walton&quot;? Old Sam missed that bet, but  some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other multi billionaire may not.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I think there are two classes of problem here.  One calls for a vast amount
<BR>
of money to pay for a research or exploration effort, with short-to-middle
<BR>
term timescales and concrete goals, and sometimes the potential for
<BR>
future profit.  The Mars mission looks to be in this category.  Take
<BR>
Zubrin's &quot;Case for Mars&quot;, and fund it.  The problem with this remains
<BR>
finding the funding sources.  Fortunes like Sam Walton's are tied up
<BR>
in Wal-Mart stock; that $25G couldn't be realized in cash in the short
<BR>
term.   This is even more true for dot-com wealth - any large scale,
<BR>
short-term effort to cash out will crash any of those stocks.  I can
<BR>
see these fortunes being applied as seed capital for business ventures
<BR>
with a long-term outlook (sort of like patient, family wealth), but
<BR>
money on a mission-to-Mars scale just might not be there in the short run,
<BR>
even given the Gates' of the world.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The second class of problem - the &quot;Henchman's Fund&quot; and that sort of thing,
<BR>
are long-term solutions waiting for problems.  These fit the foundation
<BR>
model more closely and can be financed through money thrown off by long-
<BR>
term management of a large portfolio.  It'd take a bit more active
<BR>
management to get cash out of a dot-com paper-rich portfolio, but it's
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Now, of course, the fun part..
<BR>
<P>Several people have written back with the notion that the 3rd World is
<BR>
full of potential.  I agree - lots and lots of potential, most of the world's
<BR>
population, resources, fascinating cultures, and (often) no lack of drive
<BR>
on the part of the people.  Anyone who's travelled in the &quot;developing&quot; world
<BR>
has seen this: marketplaces and traffic and microbusinesses everywhere.
<BR>
Huge potential - and yet rarely does anything of consequence.  Why?
<BR>
There's no single answer - resources, education, lots of things have been
<BR>
mentioned.   However, there's one thing that's a constant in
<BR>
&quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries: terrible, terrible, short-sighted, kleptocratic,
<BR>
nepotistic, dictatorial &gt;government&lt;.   The education that's supposed to
<BR>
come from giving whizzy slate computers to the people, or the rise in
<BR>
property values that might otherwise come from buying up seemingly valuable
<BR>
rights-of-way in places like Lagos, can't happen if the leaders of the
<BR>
countries won't allow you to do it - or worse, will be happy to see the
<BR>
investment, and then will confiscate it - either overtly, or over time
<BR>
through punitive taxation, extortion, and all the usual 3rd World means.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
So - how about the Revolution Foundation?  A well-funded group develops
<BR>
both a business plan - and an invasion plan - for a target country.  The
<BR>
ineffective leadership is forced out in one way or another.  The group
<BR>
comes in with sufficient resources (mostly trained staff, this isn't to
<BR>
be another throw-money-away venture) to build up needed institutions -
<BR>
courts, schools, etc.  Our favorite sort of minimal-interference,
<BR>
market-respecting government is instituted.  It doesn't have to be 
<BR>
democratic, day one likely it can't be.  &gt;Now&lt; buy the land. Sit
<BR>
back and wait.
<BR>
<P>How much could it cost to take over, say, Zaire/Congo, anyway?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
(I'm only about half joking [and much less than half-baked], but it
<BR>
seems that so few so-called solutions for the problems of 3rd World
<BR>
countries take the corrosive realities of many local political systems
<BR>
into account.)
