<EM>&gt; &gt; As I understand it, the fabrics/dyes used in BDUs are non-reflective in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; IR spectrum so that you don't stand out when painted with an IR beam
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (e.g. from near spectrum devices like night vision).  You can't effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shield a person against far infrared e.g. FLIR.  For hunters, there is a UV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; issue with some detergeants and brighteners, since certain animals can see

<EM>&gt; &gt; into the UV spectrum.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From my own experience in Panama during the invasion to get Noriega,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and as SOP for other deployments and exercises, we weren't allowed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starch our BDUs or use common consumer detergents. I've seen first hand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what starch in BDUs does to its 'non-reflective' capabilities when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viewed through tactical Night Vision Goggles, I would imagine its the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same effect with FLIR. Makes you light up like a street light.

<P><P>Most &quot;night vision&quot; equipment operates in the near infrared and operates
<BR>
on reflected light in the same way visual spectrum equipment does.  This
<BR>
is why they have IR emitters for use with night vision; they act as
<BR>
flashlights to increase the amount of reflected IR light.  The dyes in the
<BR>
BDU fabric are designed to be non-reflective in the infrared spectrum in
<BR>
the same way they are designed to be non-reflective in the visible
<BR>
spectrum.
<BR>
<P>FLIR is a passive far infrared technology that resolves black body
<BR>
radiation being emitted by heat sources, something which cannot be easily
<BR>
shielded and which humans emit in abundance.  The FIR and NIR are
<BR>
fundamentally different in their theory of operation.  The difference is
<BR>
analogous to passive and active sonar technologies.  NIR devices like
<BR>
night vision rely on reflected signals for discrimination, FIR devices
<BR>
like FLIR rely on finding anomalous patterns in the ambient environment
<BR>
for discrimination.
