&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Some men do see it this way.  I can't explain your own opinion,
<BR>
&nbsp;it seems that you have come to a set of realizations and made
<BR>
&nbsp;some decisions on your own.  I respect that, but I don't think
<BR>
&nbsp;I could explain it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I'll go along with a lot of Replicant's comments on this part of
<BR>
&nbsp;the thread. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>I don't think you DO feel trapped. I think you feel slightly superior and 
<BR>
possibly immune to such entrapment, by way of your own intellect. I agree 
<BR>
with that stance, it seems mature and self-responsible. I know women who 
<BR>
often complain of feeling trapped by glass ceilings, and subservient or 
<BR>
sexual roles they are expected to play. Perhaps men have less of their 
<BR>
options removed, and can move more freely, unless they are interested in 
<BR>
taking on traditional female roles for some reason. If a huge portion of men 
<BR>
suddenly wanted to wear make-up and be homemakers I bet there'd be a lot of 
<BR>
flack about it : )
<BR>
<P>I am beginning to see your point. You are saying that it is not productive to 
<BR>
cast blame on outside forces or &quot;society,&quot; but rather to disown oneself from 
<BR>
them and take responsibility.  The latest women's movement seems to share 
<BR>
this opinion.
<BR>
<P>While this is proactive positive, it can indicate denial. I am not saying YOU 
<BR>
are in denial, but there are people who would rather not acknowledge a 
<BR>
problem and instead insist it is not there. or that it has gone away of it's 
<BR>
own accord ... just a thought...
