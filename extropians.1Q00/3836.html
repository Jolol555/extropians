<P><EM>&gt; Sounds wrong. The problem with building a tower is that you need

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are no such materials that would give a working tapering ratio -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with enough tapering you could do it, but the result of the &quot;how high

<EM>&gt; concluded it needed several thousand kilometers of base to reach

<P>It seems that those conversations may have been in error.

<P>Landis says a standard 2240 km high, compression tower built out of
<BR>
boron/epoxy (supporting a Shuttle payload) would have a diameter of
<BR>
1 cm at the top and 9 meters at the bottom.
<BR>
<P>A pressurized 1 atm tower from PBO fibre, would be 2.21 m at the top and 
<BR>
138 meters at the base.  I can build a 138m platform in the ocean easily
<BR>
it draws about the mass of an oil tanker.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Beanstalks &quot;work&quot; because high tensile strengths are possible and most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parts of the structure are outside the strong gravitational field near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the earth and hence do not contribute much to the tension.
</EM><BR>
<P>It turns out that a sky hook cable masses more than the equivalent tower
<BR>
because it has to support more weight in the high gravitational field.
<BR>
But the differences the lower compression strength in a non-pressurized
<BR>
tower vs. the tensile strength of a sky hook make the masses come out
<BR>
in the same general neighborhood.
<BR>
<P>If the Landis estimates for Alumina wiskers are close to diamond, it
<BR>
looks like nanotech should be able to build a tower massing 4-5 times
<BR>
less (about 40,000 tons).  Thats about an order of magnitude less material
<BR>
than is in the Empire State Building.
