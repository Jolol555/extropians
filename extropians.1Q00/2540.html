From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com?Subject=RE:%20near-term%20processing%20power%20growth&In-Reply-To=&lt;BFF90FB6CF66D111BF4F0000F840DB850FB42C0F@lassie.dns.microsoft.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com</A>]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I will simply comment that Moore's law is often misquoted.  In its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *original* form (from Moore's original statements in the '60's),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that it *only* discussed circuit *density*.  That would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imply nothing about clock speed (advances or lack thereof due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases in power consumption), cache or memory bandwidth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limitations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture advantages (reduced-instruction-set (RISC),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multi-arithmetic-logic-units/chip, Very-Long-Instruction-Words, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very true.  In recent years, it's been bastardized to mean 60%
<BR>
*performance* increases each year, which wasn't Moore's original intent, but
<BR>
nevertheless has held true for some time.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The SIA projections are moderately conservative projections (after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all they are an industry consensus).  
</EM><BR>
<P>Just to keep us all honest, these projections are massively conservative.
<BR>
Let's use your observation and just talk about circuit density.  The 97
<BR>
roadmap projects a doubling of circuit density between 2003 and 2007.
<BR>
That's a growth rate of only 20% per year - far below Moore's rule of thumb.
<BR>
<P><P>With estimates that conservative, naturally it's easy to beat them.
<BR>
<P>All that having been said, and in response to your other comments, I do
<BR>
believe that the rate will eventually accelerate.  There is even weak
<BR>
evidence for a current acceleration.  I would prefer, however, to see much
<BR>
stronger evidence before kicking off the singularity celebrations.
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
mez
