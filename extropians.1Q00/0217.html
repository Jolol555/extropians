<P>
<EM>&gt; Robert Owen
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;most philosophies of life have social or cultural implications.
</EM><BR>
<P>but that
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;it does not seem to me that the practice of Extropianism
</EM><BR>
<P>---or transhumanism in general---
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;depends on the vagaries of public opinion or sentiment, or on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevailing political climate.
</EM><BR>
<P>That of course does not mean that positive action should not be taken.
<BR>
But it also does not mean that all means are equal.  Perhaps an
<BR>
important thing to do now with regard to unity of purpose, strength in
<BR>
community, and coordination of knowledge is basic organization and
<BR>
scholarship.
<BR>
<P>Transhumanists are now in communication via a few mailing lists and
<BR>
Web sites.  There are indeed informal or formal factions, divisions,
<BR>
and simply levels of interest, seriousness, and awareness within
<BR>
transhumanism.  Not everyone is happy with the Extropian Principles or
<BR>
the Singularitarian Principles or the e-Future Principles or the
<BR>
Colonel Zing-Zang Principles.  But I would like the debates,
<BR>
discussions, references, information on individuals and organizations
<BR>
publicly involved, et cetera could be readily accessible to everyone
<BR>
(including, of course, the mysterious general public).
<BR>
<P>Hence the FAQs, the _Journal of Transhumanism_, _the Transhumanist_,
<BR>
the new, I see, _Transhumanist Times_, the proposal for a Singularity
<BR>
Institute, the various organizations and societies, and several
<BR>
informative personal Web sites.  I don't want to suggest a centralized
<BR>
network but I would like to see a certain coherence binding these
<BR>
efforts and others together.  Call me old-fashioned but a scientific
<BR>
community is not and should not be a political one in the usual sense, in the 
<BR>
way that typical &quot;politics&quot; is conducted.
<BR>
