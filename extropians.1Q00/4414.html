<P>
For Robert, Anders and everyone else,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for better explaining to me, the probable nature of nanotech 
<BR>
development and implementation.  It makes sense that things will happen 
<BR>
incrementally and that the software and hardware would be carefully crafted 
<BR>
to stop at least most hacking.
<BR>
<P>And of course, there would be countermeasures that could be carried out by a 
<BR>
neighbor, municipality, state or nation or global alliance, depending on the 
<BR>
severity of the incident.  And hopefully, the vast majority of humanity will 
<BR>
be wise in their use of it, out of respect for others or out of fear of 
<BR>
quick and powerful reprisal.
<BR>
<P>I have to admit that the idea of a first world nation, a democracy, being a 
<BR>
&quot;captor&quot; of it's population in terms of demanding taxes and denying the 
<BR>
right to freely leave and not return, is pretty bizarre to me, but there is 
<BR>
a logic to it.  I have a hard time sometimes seeing the full scope of 
<BR>
transformation that may come to our society.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
<BR>
<P>Robert J. Bradbury (<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@www.aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20I'm%20still%20trying%20to%20see%20the%20full%20scope%20of%20change%20that%20may%20be%20coming....&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000309073910.86822.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bradbury@www.aeiveos.com</A>)

<EM>&gt;a way that would make the gun control issue look minor by comparison.

John, you really need to get that this isn't going to work. The people who 
<BR>
want to play with &quot;everything&quot; boxes will simply move someplace else! We 
<BR>
either have to go to a complete police state where even your thoughts are 
<BR>
monitored or else develop the means of trusting people and their creations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In the name of public safety and national security, we may never be allowed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these replicators within our homes in the first place. The gov't and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporate powers may say, &quot;come to us, and for a &quot;nominal&quot; charge we will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;create what you want.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This doesn't solve anything. I can spend my time on my computer designing 
<BR>
those things I want, take a fast ship to some remote asteroid and build it, 
<BR>
then send it back to dismantle Earth. Do you *really* think once Zyvex or 
<BR>
IBM has announced that diamondoid nanoassembly is possible that dozens of 
<BR>
people won't start working on building their own!!! This isn't nuclear-tech 
<BR>
where you need an actual uranium mine. The raw materials (C) can be 
<BR>
extracted from the air for heaven's sake.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Underground groups would have massive federal resources allocated against 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them, to put them behind bars. The hacker hunts would pale by comparison. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nano would be used to violate civil liberties that would be reminiscient of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the war on drugs but more clandestine and for that reason even more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;threatening to people's rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
For you to have massive Federal resources, you have to have massive 
<BR>
&quot;funding&quot; for the hunters. After everyone has stopped paying taxes and/or 
<BR>
left the U.S. if it gets too intrusive, *who* do you think is going to do 
<BR>
the &quot;hunting&quot;? Only if you have AIs that are cheap and tireless will this 
<BR>
possibly resemble what might happen.
<BR>
<P>Do you think that any government will survive that tries to imprison its 
<BR>
population and force them to pay taxes in an era when this is unnecessary?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My hope is that home nanoreplicator technology will develop very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incrementally and we will see it gain a foothold in the private citizen's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realm that will not be possible to reverse.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Its already impossible to reverse. There are so many paths to 
<BR>
nanoreplicators of various kinds (the phase space for the chemistry of 
<BR>
nanoassembly of various materials is huge) that the government *cannot* stop 
<BR>
this without killing just about everyone with an above average IQ.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;May corporate greed and the forces of capitalism triumph in this area!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think &quot;corporations&quot; as we currently imagine them are probably pretty 
<BR>
doomed as well. I would guess that perhaps only the entertainment 
<BR>
conglomerates and perhaps education or tourism promoters will survive in the 
<BR>
long run. &quot;Classical&quot; corporations may do ok during the interim period until 
<BR>
everyone has all of their basic survival needs met, but after that there is 
<BR>
going to be a big restructuring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With capitalistic inducements, proper safeguards and no individual or group 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overcoming them to do something really vicious as an excuse for the gov't, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we may see our dreams come true.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>For a group to cause trouble, you need to make a case for *what* would 
<BR>
motivate them to cause trouble. Increased wealth and mobility should give 
<BR>
people the ability to simply avoid or transcend the things that have 
<BR>
motivated trouble makers in the past (oppression, taxation, prejudice, 
<BR>
etc.). Only if we get some loony-tunes religious or anarchist terror groups 
<BR>
that think their way is the only way will we have something to worry about. 
<BR>
Its not the average wo/man you need to worry about, its the people who would 
<BR>
want to control *all* of us that are a concern.
<BR>
<P>Robert
