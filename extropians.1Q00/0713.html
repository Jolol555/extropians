'What is your name?'  'Dan Fabulich.'  'Do you deny having written the 
<BR>
following? (on Fri, 14 Jan 2000)': 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 'Do you deny having written the following?':
</EM><BR>
<P>I admit it !
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If I read this argument correctly, all you seem to be saying here is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any statement which &quot;clashes&quot; with Dynamic Optimism is false.  While this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IS entailed by the truth of Dynamic Optimism, if by &quot;clashes&quot; you mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;logically contradicts,&quot; the claim seems so trivial that I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're saying anything other than &quot;Dynamic Optimism is right.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe you mean something broader with your use of &quot;clashes&quot;?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I meant it in a different way, namely:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Having established the 'truth' of the statement &quot;D.O. is right&quot; we can use 
<BR>
that statement in its turn as a tool to determine the 'truth' (or 'falsity') 
<BR>
of other theories.  This is analogous to using e.g. logical consistency, once 
<BR>
we have decided that logical consistency is &quot;right&quot;, as a tool help determine 
<BR>
the 'truth' of another theory (a theory other than the theory &quot;logical 
<BR>
consistency is right&quot;). 
<BR>
<P>With this new tool, we can (if we so want) do reasoning which makes less use 
<BR>
of other reasoning-tools.  Example: consider theory A: 'John will never do 
<BR>
anything good in his life'.  This theory does not logically contradict, nor 
<BR>
logically supports, in a direct way, the statement &quot;D.O.-ism is right&quot;.  Now 
<BR>
we go use the new tool to determine the 'truth' of theory A: we can say that 
<BR>
the theory &quot;clashes&quot; with D.O.-ism because it opens up no new positive 
<BR>
insights or possibilities for anyone which can be positively and usefully 
<BR>
exploited in a D.O. way to anyone's own benefit.  This is equivalent to saying 
<BR>
that theory A does not provide a basis or foothold for expansion or growth or 
<BR>
any other kind of D.O. thing.  Or equivalent to saying that the theory does 
<BR>
not give a person 'believing' :-):-) in D.O. any tools to use that theory to 
<BR>
achieve something 'Positive'.  Or, in a more 'mystical' wording, equivalent to 
<BR>
saying that the theory does not shed Light on things, only Darkness. :-) 
<BR>
(Sorry, I do really mean this fully seriously; please bear with me in spite of 
<BR>
these last two sentences.)  So now, in this way, we have decided that theory A 
<BR>
&quot;clashes&quot; with D.O.-ism, WITHOUT having made use of showing that theory A 
<BR>
logically contradicts or supports D.O.-ism (or vice versa that D.O.ism 
<BR>
contradicts/supports theory A).  Having decided that theory A &quot;clashes&quot; (in 
<BR>
this sense) with D.O.-ism, we then immediately use this as our reason to pin 
<BR>
the jugment 'false' on theory A. 
<BR>
<P>What I want to assert is that the above type of reasoning (which may sound a 
<BR>
bit simplistic, I admit -- but I just like simplistic examples :-)) is a solid 
<BR>
and permissible way to do logic, and that any conclusions drawn from this type 
<BR>
of reasoning are the same as one would get using the conventional 
<BR>
reasoning-tools and the conventional body of well-established 'knowledge' or 
<BR>
axioms.  The new reasoning-tool merely provides a shortcut that enables one in 
<BR>
some cases to come to conclusions quicker -- but a longer chain of reasoning 
<BR>
using the other existing tools must always lead to the same conclusions.  
<BR>
Alternatively, I think that the kind of reasoning used in the paragraph above 
<BR>
can *at least* help as a tool to quickly make a first (limited-accuracy) guess 
<BR>
about whether a theory is 'true' when one has too little time (as e.g. happens 
<BR>
often in daily life) to do the full reasoning in the conventional way. 
<BR>
<P>Very best greetings,       Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Dynamic%20Optimism%20as%20a%20tool%20in%20logical%20reasoning&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000114195944.1263A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
