<P>Aha, similar minds...
<BR>
<P>Actually Anders, it looks like this link disappeared.  If anyone
<BR>
can find it, please post a the *URL*.  (I wouldn't encourage
<BR>
anyone who has the page to put it up anyplace in the open
<BR>
unless they like talking to lawyers.)
<BR>
<P>Now, I've adjusted the squid proxy server on two machines in Moscow
<BR>
so people can use them.  The log files go to /dev/null (meaning
<BR>
no traces are kept).  If we get another valid URL, you should
<BR>
set your proxy server to ilr.genebee.msu.su or iabunix.iab.ac.ru
<BR>
and use port 3128.  Then paste the URL into your browser window
<BR>
and request the page.  The request goes to the squid server
<BR>
and the squid server requests the page from whomever is hosting
<BR>
it.  No records are kept of who requested the page, so &quot;Big Brothers&quot;
<BR>
trace of who downloaded the page is going to be pretty dead in the water.
<BR>
There is a remote possibility that organizations in Russia might be
<BR>
keeping track of the ISP traffic, but I will be ROTFL if any Western
<BR>
corporation tries to convince them to release such information.
<BR>
<P>The links are slow (and go up and down), so please be patient
<BR>
and try one or more times if there is a problem.  Also, please
<BR>
reset the proxy server after you get the page (otherwise your
<BR>
browsing will be *really* slow).
<BR>
<P>I believe this is going to tie the lawyers and corporate haunchos
<BR>
up in knots, not only from the difficulty of tracing where all the
<BR>
copies went, but also from the perspective of who has legal jurisdiction.
<BR>
<P>Strike a blow for freedom.
<BR>
<P>I will note in passing, that I generally don't encourage public
<BR>
dissemination of information that would allow children to bypass
<BR>
net filters, but if such information is squirreled away in various
<BR>
places and children figure out how to &quot;discover&quot; it, then I think
<BR>
what they learn by playing the game balances the cost.  At any
<BR>
rate, I think forcing open dialog between parents and children,
<BR>
so children get to the point of, &quot;Oh, bleech, its just another
<BR>
stupid boring porn site, click back&quot;.   Far more important than net
<BR>
filters, IMO, is browser options that prevent the stupid porn
<BR>
sites from launching 5 windows, making them &quot;sticky&quot; (*Don't even
<BR>
think about going there...*) and making the &lt;back&gt; button not work.
<BR>
You gotta draw the line at sites that start taking over your machine...
