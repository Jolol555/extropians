<P>
Based on the fact my weight loss stalled
<BR>
after 30 lbs, I tried the &quot;fat fast&quot; recommended
<BR>
by Dr. Atkins in such cases.  The fat fast, far
<BR>
from abstaining from fat, consists of eating only
<BR>
fat, 900 calories per day, for 5 days in a row.
<BR>
<P>Within 2-3 days, my ketones went from &quot;trace&quot;
<BR>
to large.  Over, the 5 day period, I dropped 8 lbs.
<BR>
Over the next 5 days, I stabilized at a 5 lb loss,
<BR>
going back to the standard Atkins low carb diet.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I will try this again in a few weeks.

Subject: Atkins Diet Testimonial--Test Results!
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 11-25-99, I reported to this
<BR>
list on the results of my
<BR>
Atkins, low carobohydrate, hi-protein-
<BR>
hi fat diet.  I lost about 30 lbs since
<BR>
October 15th, 1999, starting at 255
<BR>
and 6' 1&quot;.  This is only 5 additional
<BR>
pounds loss since 11-25-99.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I finally got my second blood
<BR>
test results back.  My total cholesterol
<BR>
went down from 238 to 190.  Good
<BR>
cholesterol went from 45 to 55.  Bad
<BR>
cholesterol went from 161 to 120.
<BR>
Triglycerides went from 193 to 92.
<BR>
Ketones went from negative to
<BR>
&quot;trace&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty impressive results I would
<BR>
say and exactly what Atkins says
<BR>
is typical!   I remain feeling great
<BR>
with improved energy level.  As stated
<BR>
before it seems I can lift about the
<BR>
same max. weight in my exercise
<BR>
program, but with fewer reps.  Lifting
<BR>
max weight and reps improving
<BR>
only a little since I reported in late
<BR>
November.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to most charts, I 
<BR>
should lose another 20-30 pounds.
<BR>
I have stalled in weight loss for
<BR>
about 30 days staying pretty
<BR>
strictly to the Atkins program.
<BR>
