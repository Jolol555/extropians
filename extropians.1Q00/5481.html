<P><EM>&gt; Which is odd. All they have to do to privatize it is issue stock to 
</EM><BR>
each and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; every citizen. If the oil industry causes the country to go to hell 
</EM><BR>
after that,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; its their own fault.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but do you really believe our government will ever promote such 
<BR>
a measure?
<BR>
It is obvious they won't, they use PEMEX to fund the national reserves 
<BR>
every time
<BR>
they consume all our taxes in other practices, so they would never 
<BR>
privatize it's 
<BR>
main cash cow. Not only that they also use the powers of the media to 
<BR>
brainwash
<BR>
naïve uninformed citizens that oil should be administered by the 
<BR>
government
<BR>
(even though our oil crisis have been caused by them) and that 
<BR>
whomever dares
<BR>
to say the oil industry should be private is a traitor, the same 
<BR>
happens with
<BR>
wiser economic practices, so politicians usually don't dare to promote 
<BR>
an economic
<BR>
reform, because what they want is voters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Concerning corrupt police, it is precisely one of the aspects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; annoys me the most, the past week I was a victim of police and I had 
</EM><BR>
to give
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up 2 valuable possessions for me to be released. That's why although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've been silent in the gun debates, I think if guns were legalized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here in Mexico, police wouldn't abuse us as much as they do.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I got the old shakedown once when I and some buddies in my Air Force 
</EM><BR>
unit went
<BR>
<EM>&gt; down to TJ for some R&amp;R when we deployed to Miramar for some cross 
</EM><BR>
service
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exercises. Fortunately it only cost each of us $25.00.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lucky for you, I had to spend about 500 ouch!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; About foreign aid, it is our corrupt government who accepts it because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we really shouldn't depend on foreign capital, we have the resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; infrastructure and population to be autosuficient, however the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nation's riches are stolen by those in power and they have to ask for 
</EM><BR>
foreign
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aid to compensate, sometimes the foreign aid comes directly from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; u.s. To their pockets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The moment we are able to get rid of all the scum that keeps deciding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what's best for us in a big brother approach, and brainwashing us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; against libertarianism, wiser economic policies or privatization, 
</EM><BR>
we'll be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; able to grow (hell we even do with all this)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Imperialism involves using force to get done what you want done, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; locking other industrial powers out of the resources in the nations 
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have power over. Offering a country aid money in return for help in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfilling our own foreign policy needs is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree, but if the U.S. Government knows the foreign aids they send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; benefits more corrupt politicians than us, and it just makes our 
</EM><BR>
dependence
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; greater why do they continue sending it? It appears to me they 
</EM><BR>
indirectly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support our corrupt government, why has never the U.S. Complained 
</EM><BR>
about the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tyranny we face and how they should help us in our advance to 
</EM><BR>
democracy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I was writing my previous post, I was thinking the exact same 
</EM><BR>
thing, the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fact they so eagerly accept our aid (and don't follow through on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreements on drug enforcement) ought to indicate how eagerly they 
</EM><BR>
accept money
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from other sources that are at counter purposes to us (i.e. the drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffickers).
</EM><BR>
<P>OK I hope you've noticed the trend here then, our government is 
<BR>
completely corrupt
<BR>
and should be changed (something it is already happening) the problem 
<BR>
is that the
<BR>
U.S. Collaborates a lot with our government to oppress us, I'm sure 
<BR>
you don't need
<BR>
very high IQ to know that if the U.S. Keeps giving us money we don't 
<BR>
need or use
<BR>
or if drugs keep coming and the quality and prices are better, it is 
<BR>
because
<BR>
both of our governments cooperate in these issues. Also the U.S. 
<BR>
Government is as
<BR>
corrupt as ours, the only difference is that our police force is a lot 
<BR>
more corrupt
<BR>
than it's American counterpart, guess why there is drug war and nobody 
<BR>
has ever tried
<BR>
to end the tyranny we have been suffering here for 70 years. If they 
<BR>
really cared
<BR>
about what happens in Mexico, they would have ended with the 
<BR>
oppression a long time ago
<BR>
and if they really cared about the consequences of drug traffic 
<BR>
(crime, etc.) they would
<BR>
have legalized drugs a long time ago.
