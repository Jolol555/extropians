<P>
My extrospecial friends,
<BR>
<P>I don't recall quite how it happened, but the other day a method of cooling
<BR>
Jupiter brains just popped into my head.  It was one of those &quot;Oh, my,
<BR>
that's nifty!&quot; kind of ideas, and I let it sit awhile, so that, in case
<BR>
there was something obviously silly about it that I was missing, maybe I
<BR>
would see it and not make a fool of myself, and then have to do one of my
<BR>
&quot;confession of wrongness&quot; routines.  But, I haven't found a major problem
<BR>
with it, so here goes.
<BR>
<P>In an elliptical orbit in relation to the jupiter brain, you have the
<BR>
&quot;coolant&quot;.  However, rather than being a point mass, like, say, a comet,
<BR>
it's ring-like: particles (carbon black?) of the appropriate material and
<BR>
size evenly spaced along an  elliptical orbital path.  
<BR>
<P>Now normally you think of an orbit as being outside the outer surface of
<BR>
the planet.  If it were otherwise, it would slam into either (1) the
<BR>
atmosphere of the planet, or (2) the planet itself, and, kersplatt!, could
<BR>
not properly be called an &quot;orbit&quot;.  But if there were a tunnel through the
<BR>
planet, that coincided with the orbital path, then the orbiting material
<BR>
could actually zip right through the planet, entering one side and exiting
<BR>
the other, and then head on out to the furthest reaches of the ellipse far
<BR>
out in space.  Not hard to see where this is going.  Obviously, to avoid a
<BR>
problem with atmospheric drag, the Jupiter brain would have to be sans
<BR>
atmosphere ( I mean what does a Jupiter brain need an atmosphere for?), or
<BR>
alternatively, the ends of the tunnel/tube would have to reach above the
<BR>
outer reaches of the atmosphere.  So, you see, the coolant goes in cold,
<BR>
absorbs heat from the brain, zips out the &quot;exhaust pipe&quot;, and radiates away
<BR>
its heat as it makes its circuit out and then back again.
<BR>
<P>Finally, examining the geometry, we see that the tube will mostly pass
<BR>
through just one side of the JB.  So, to more evenly and efficiently cool
<BR>
the JB--which I picture as being more or less solid and more or less
<BR>
spherical--I envision two coolant flows, with the major axes of the two
<BR>
ellipses lying along the same line, but the planes of the two ellipses
<BR>
turned ninety degrees relative to one another, like two links in a chain
<BR>
looping through one another, thus providing cooling symmetrically to the
<BR>
opposite hemispheres of the JB.  Internal radiators, internal (ie
<BR>
non-orbiting) coolant flows, and the various other JB components, would be
<BR>
built around the coolant tubes so as to optimize their function (well, duh!).
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there would be some challenge keeping the coolant aligned with the
<BR>
tubes, ie, keeping the orbits stable (do orbiting rings ever orbit in
<BR>
ellipses?), but I'll leave that for the orbital mechanics girls and
<BR>
boys--Amara, Doug?--to mull over.  Why should I have all the fun?
<BR>
<P>But, anyway, it seemed beautifully elegant to me.
<BR>
<P>Ain't it wonderful to be alive?  Have a terrific day.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
