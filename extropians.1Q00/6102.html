<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dont worry Mike, I dont want to spy on you.  {8-]  spike

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure you don't, I have good anti-air defenses for flying things 15

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cm in size. My 20 guage shotgun that is perfect for woodcock, with #9
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shot, would take our your little spy plane at anything less than 50
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yards, and with magnum loads I could make shots of around 75-100 yards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; altitude. Anything higher and I'd have to bring out the goose gun.... 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guage #6 magnum loads....    Happy flying....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but you'd have to know it was a spy plane, right?  I mean, you're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; just going to whip out your goose gun and take pot shots at any moderately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; low-flying plane that buzzes over your property... right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Its my property, right? Since there is no law AGAINST shooting down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; model airplanes that trespass on ones property, then it must be open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; season..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, yeah, but a lot of municipalities tend to get a bit excited about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;discharging a firearm within city limits&quot;.  The neighbors might also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object to having birdshot raining out of the sky (what goes up...).
</EM><BR>
<P>I just led a successful public battle to prevent our city council from imposing a
<BR>
noise ordinance that would have banned all discharging of firearms outside of
<BR>
police and hunting use (i.e. no target shooting or self defense) among other
<BR>
things. It was regarded as the most stringent noise ordinance proposed in northern
<BR>
new england.
<BR>
<P>After much debate, and attempts to defer the ordinance until a city council
<BR>
meeting came up that I and/or a reporter did not attend, they have tabled the
<BR>
ordinance for a year....
<BR>
<P>Birdshot on the terminal leg of its trajectory is not much worse than falling
<BR>
rain, the only objection they could have is that I'd be polluting their property
<BR>
with lead, and thats assuming that my property is not big enough that I retain all
<BR>
shot on my own land.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It would be more sneaky to just poke the snooper's eye out with a pulsed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laser, or nondestructively track it with a 5-watt argon laser.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latter might suffice to discourage paparazzi in a helicopter at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celebrity events (although a stinger missile mockup would be more fun).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get an image of Mike mistakenly laser-zapping an inquisitive raven-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squawwwk!
</EM><BR>
<P>crow is good eatin'. I imagine raven would be just as tasty...
