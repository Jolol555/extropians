<EM>&gt; I seem to recall Heinlein's juvinile novel &quot;Star Beast&quot; where the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that turns out to be a princess when her family arrives to bring her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home. She demands that she can take her John Thomas and his girlfreind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with her, because,&quot;She's been raising John Thomases for several

<P>John, if you're out there, I'm really sorry, and I hope that is your online
<BR>
handle, and not your real name, and this hasn't come as a terrible shock...
<BR>
or maybe you've got a sense of humour.
