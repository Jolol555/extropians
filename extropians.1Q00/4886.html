Dan Fabulich, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Luddites%20are%20everywhere!&In-Reply-To=&lt;200003141835.KAA05606@finney.org&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;, writes, regarding the Unabomber:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Because, in an important sense, the beliefs which he shares with us (&quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sun will rise tomorrow,&quot; &quot;computers will get cheaper,&quot; &quot;there have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some black dogs&quot;, etc.) were not the relevant reasons he did what he did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the other hand, these other beliefs which he holds, and shares with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill Joy, ARE an important part of the cause of his acting that way.
</EM><BR>
<P>In fact, if you look at it from Bill Joy's perspective, he sees the
<BR>
destruction of the human race if we don't get off our current path.
<BR>
In that case, extremist bombing campaigns like Kaczynski's could be
<BR>
considered completely justified, and for exactly the reason Kaczynski
<BR>
gave, to save the world.  Kaczynski's problem was not that he was wrong
<BR>
or crazy, but that he was ineffective.  A few random mail bombs are not
<BR>
enough to change the course of history.
<BR>
<P>Joy is thinking much bigger.  He wants to build a surveillance state that
<BR>
would dwarf anything in history.  He wants to derail economic growth and
<BR>
mire billions of people in abject poverty.  Next to Bill Joy, Kaczynski
<BR>
was a piker.  His paltry few victims pale in comparison to the excess
<BR>
deaths that would follow from Joy's prescription.
<BR>
<P>The two men are not so different, after all.
<BR>
