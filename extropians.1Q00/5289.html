<EM>&gt; This does of course raise very *interesting* questions as to whether,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the future, when humans have much higher inter-individual communication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwidths, they will choose to operate more as collectives (e.g. the
</EM><BR>
borg)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and less as rugged individuals.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do we have to wait for brain transplants wirelessly connect through the
<BR>
Internet? We have had this for 10s of thousands of years. It is called
<BR>
language,
<BR>
culture, mythology, science, art, common sense.............
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I cannot help but conclude that in the light of rational thought and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the experiences on which those thoughts are based, we are as one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only if you have different experiences or think irrationally can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you be an &quot;individual&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree with that with qualifications. First, any new experiences will
<BR>
be
<BR>
interpreted and understood within the framework of collective experience, if
<BR>
it is that new, at least to serve as a foundation. Second, in thinking
<BR>
irrationally,
<BR>
that has to be qualified. Even people who think irrationally do so with well
<BR>
established logic base to support it. Whether we agree or not, or provide
<BR>
evidence to undercut key premises of their logic structure is another
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
If it is instead driven by mental illness or psychological trama, we do not
<BR>
qualify that as individual expression. Except in the past when there lacked
<BR>
the understanding of what mental illness is.
