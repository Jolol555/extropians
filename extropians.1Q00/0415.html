Well, this raises some very interesting points.  It tooks some time
<BR>
for me to understand the situation in Chechniya because we really
<BR>
don't understand Russian history very well.  The people in that
<BR>
region very strongly &quot;independence&quot; minded, it would be questionable
<BR>
whether even their own self-elected (local) government would have
<BR>
much control over them (similar to the &quot;tribes&quot; in Afganastan or Somalia).
<BR>
Stalin solved the problem by packing up the entire population
<BR>
and moving them to the steppes in the middle of Russia where they
<BR>
pretty much remained until after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
<BR>
Since then they have been trying to &quot;break free&quot; from Russia.
<BR>
<P>Now, unlike the former &quot;republics&quot; (Kyrgyrstan, Turkmenistan,
<BR>
Kazakstan, the Ukraine, etc.) where there was a legal agreement
<BR>
regarding their &quot;participation&quot; in the Soviet Union, that became
<BR>
null-and-void after the breakup or the semi-autonomous regions
<BR>
where there are strong historical precedents for semi-indpendent
<BR>
city-states/nation-states, or simply regions that have largely
<BR>
differing ethnic blocks (Ukraine &amp; Belerus to a lesser degree),
<BR>
the linkup between Chechniya and Russia seems to be quite old,
<BR>
from the times when Tsars pushed south, presumably seeking warm
<BR>
water ports.  After Stalin moved out all the Chechniyans, many ethnic
<BR>
Russians were moved in and there is of course the oil pipeline
<BR>
issue and the question of how much the locals can extort/steal
<BR>
from it.
<BR>
<P>I've often looked at the situation and compared it to the American
<BR>
Civil war where people were fighting a separate set of beliefs and
<BR>
one group wanted to impose its beliefs arguing for the protection
<BR>
of a third group, economic interests, etc.  I expect that books
<BR>
could be written on this topic.
<BR>
<P>When they resorted to kidnapping foreigners, the probably killed
<BR>
chances they might have had for getting foreign recognition.  When
<BR>
they resorted to terrorism within Russia, they probably shot themselves
<BR>
in the feet.
<BR>
<P>However the situation in Chechniya and the recent articles on micro-states
<BR>
do point out some very interesting problems we will be facing.  Lets
<BR>
say for example the GM or cloning issues turns out to be unresolvable.
<BR>
Will the only solution be for the pro-technology people to move to
<BR>
a specific location and declare independence?  If so, how does one
<BR>
accomplish this.  The people in Chechniya seem to provide good
<BR>
examples of how not to do it, while the people of Quebec may have
<BR>
a process that shows how it might be done.
