<P>Although, of course, recent research has shown that the Hindenburg disaster
<BR>
was caused by electrical sparking across outer-sheath panels*, which were
<BR>
coated in a reflective 'paint'. Alas, this reflective 'paint' was a new
<BR>
concoction, which was incredibly flammable. It was the ignition of the outer
<BR>
covering which caused the problem, and only after the craft was already
<BR>
doomed, and half-way to the ground, did the hydrogen ignite. Even with an
<BR>
helium filling the damage would have been huge and fatal.
<BR>
<P>*Movement through the air had caused a potential difference between stern
<BR>
and bow. The attaching of the mooring tether, which was wet, since it was
<BR>
raining, had earthed the ship, but not all of the outer panels were
<BR>
electrically connected, and hence the p.d. between some adjacent panels
<BR>
caused the necessary spark.
