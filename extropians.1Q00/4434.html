<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Billy Brown&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bbrown@transcient.com?Subject=Re:%20near%20anything%20box%20security%20solution%20(Was%20RE:%20The%20Internet%20is%20forever)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000309213218.98164.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bbrown@transcient.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But its worse than that.  Unless really draconian privacy measures get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enacted before the market for online personal information gets going, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expect just about anything that isn't actually secret to be easily found.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That means credit history, purchasing history, most of the paperwork you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever given the government, and probably a lot of other info I'm not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of.  Won't that be fun?
</EM><BR>
<P>Get used to it.  Privacy is a thing of the present, but not of the future.  
<BR>
I'm a firm believe that information (*all* information) wants to be free.  
<BR>
Security and privacy are mutually exclusive when you think about it and in 
<BR>
the battle between the two I'm sure security will win out in the end.  I 
<BR>
foresee a future where all information is available about everyone.
<BR>
<P>I know this can be shocking to our 20th Century sensibilities, but really it 
<BR>
won't be such a bad thing to be so totally exposed when everyone is equally 
<BR>
exposed.  The fact that you inhaled, or cheated on a test, or posted an 
<BR>
embarrassingly inane rant in alt.erotica.bestiality, or fell behind in your 
<BR>
Visa payments will not really matter much when it becomes a matter of public 
<BR>
record that everyone else has done the same things.  There is certainly a 
<BR>
skeleton or two in my closet, but I wouldn't mind showing you mine if you 
<BR>
had to show me yours too.
<BR>
<P>In fact (aha! The lightbulb flashes), this may be just what we were looking 
<BR>
for.  A way to allow Joe Q. Public access to a near-anything-box, without 
<BR>
having to fear that he will cause the dreaded gray goo problem.  By Jove 
<BR>
I've got it!  All surveilance all the time!
<BR>
<P>Every act, every conversation (heck every thought, if possible) digitally 
<BR>
recorded forever and accessible to everyone.  Based upon a lifetime's worth 
<BR>
of such data it would probably a fairly easy matter to determine who could 
<BR>
and could not be trusted to have their very own near-anything-box (&quot;NAB&quot;).  
<BR>
If we can come up with a reliable Halperinesque truth machine, our fears 
<BR>
about our neighbors having NAB's could be eliminated.
<BR>
<P>So what do you think, would you be willing to give up all privacy in 
<BR>
exchange for the privilege of having access to a NAB?  Would such a 
<BR>
transparent society necessarily resolve our nano-related security concerns?
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;
