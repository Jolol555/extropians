<EM>&gt;&gt; Ok thanks for sharing adolescent fantasies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, who are you calling adolescent? :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hey, what exactly is wrong with a man wanting there to be lots of beautiful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women in the world?  (Or vice versa, of course.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; (Now if you can also program them to tell you are the best lover in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; universe whether or not that's true....)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How about if we combine the body mods with a little hedonic engineering, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that sex can actually be as good as we all wish it was?
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean it *isn't*? You should get out more -- or rather... er, never
<BR>
mind. 8-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Ever hear of the Stepford Wives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fictional treatments of this subject always assume that 1) the women are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coerced, 2) the men are either scum or nitwits, 3) mental mods are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superficial, so the 'real you' is still in there somewhere, and 4) boring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mediocrity is somehow better than ant fantasy.  None of these assumptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are likely to hold in the real world.  I'm not sure what the result will be,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I expect it will be far more complex (and interesting) than anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;portrayed in fiction.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;several people wrote (paraphrasing):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Body mods!  Eeek!  Oh, no, everyone will become a soulless clone of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; latest trendy body style!  Evil corporations will take over our bodies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; doom us to an eternity of bland sameness.  The sky is falling!  The sky is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; falling!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yawn, yawn.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Get a grip, guys.  This attitude is itself an example of mindless conformity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to decades of bad science fiction and intellectual elitism.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;segment of society where the herd instinct is that strong is teenagers, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that is obviously a temporary phase.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it is strong in teenagers (which I doubt) that is a figment of the
<BR>
way they have been raised, and the the fact that they are incarcerated
<BR>
in institutions (schools) where conformity can be vital for survival
<BR>
(or at least for avoiding getting your head kicked in five times a
<BR>
day).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm sure most people will want to be good looking, but that does not imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they will all look the same.  It is already possible to have yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;altered to look like an attractive celebrity, but virtually no one does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What most people want is to look like themselves, only better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well... I don't know... 7 of 9's body is very tempting....
<BR>
<P>Ooops, letting the side down. Sorry, Billy. Actually, I do agree with
<BR>
you, given what you go on to say:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, the middle class gets in shape while the upper class goes looking for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ways to stand out.  Since exceptional beauty requires that you look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different than everyone around you, that means a whole new branch of art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will arise to fill the demand for unusual and esthetically pleasing bodies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And lets not forget that standards of beauty vary a great deal from person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to person, let alone between different cultures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Meanwhile, we have lots of subcultures that will probably diverge from human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;norms.  I predict that many Furries will actually become their favorite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anthropomorphic form, many sci-fi and fantasy fans will want to look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humanoid aliens or fantasy races, and many fetishists will lavish great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attention on whatever it is that they like.  Throw in a scattering of purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;functional enhancements that happen to have cosmetic side effects and you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;got a recipe for an explosion of diversity in human appearance.
</EM><BR>
