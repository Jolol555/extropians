<EM>&gt;&gt; I disagree in this specific case.  I define &quot;theist&quot; as &quot;one who
</EM><BR>
believes in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a God or gods&quot; and &quot;atheist&quot; as &quot;one who is not a theist&quot; -- the latter
</EM><BR>
does
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; not have such beliefs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For any such positions to be significant, the individual must intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ascribe these predicates to him/herself. For me to attribute atheism to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a polynesian who affirmed the efficacy of &quot;mana&quot; but was ignorant of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personified gods or goddesses would be ridiculous. To be either a &quot;theist&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or &quot;atheist&quot; one must understand these concepts and make a knowledgeable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;judgment about which, as far as s/he is concerned, correctly describes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reality as they understand it.  As ridiculous as ascribing &quot;atheism&quot; to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;infant.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gotta jump in here... why would it be ridiculous to attribute atheism to
<BR>
the above-referenced polynesian, exactly? i take &quot;atheist&quot; to mean exactly
<BR>
!(theist); where a &quot;theist&quot; is one who understands the concepts of
<BR>
&quot;personified gods or goddesses&quot;, and makes a (positive) judgement about
<BR>
their existance.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i thought it was true by definition that everything is, by default,
<BR>
athiestic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; This is a pure belief view of both.  By these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; definitions, no epistemology or argument is implied.  One could be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; atheist merely because one was never taught about religion.  Or one
</EM><BR>
could be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; an atheist because one blindly follows on this issue another person who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; an atheist.  The same could be said of the theist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As, in the above paragraph, I strongly disagree that one can be an
</EM><BR>
unconscious
<BR>
<EM>&gt;atheist, because one cannot take any responsibility for this position. The
</EM><BR>
same
<BR>
<EM>&gt;is true of the mindless compulsion to follow a leader, whether the
</EM><BR>
ideology is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;atheism or theism. A voluntary and informed consent is required.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think i missed something. why is voluntary and informed consent required
<BR>
for something to not be a theist?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The entire discussion presupposes the persons have at least reached the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Age of Reason with sufficient self-understanding to assess a statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such as &quot;There is a superior power that created you and the universe and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who knows everything about you at all times and who has decided what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;action you are to take in every situation; denying that you are his subject
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignoring his plan for you and deliberately violating his laws will result in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;severe punishment. There is nothing you can do to free yourself from this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hm. why should we presuppose that the subjects involved have any
<BR>
self-understanding whatsoever? heh... i've seen this debate quite a few
<BR>
times on alt.atheism.moderated, and i never understood what the big deal
<BR>
was... i mean, if i point at something and say &quot;is that a theist?&quot; and we
<BR>
decide that no, its not, then it is an atheist. in the same way, if i point
<BR>
at something and ask &quot;is that a luddite?&quot; and we decide that its not, then
<BR>
it could be called an aluddite, and perhaps described (for example) as
<BR>
being aludditic [just flows off the tongue... ;) ]. and if something is
<BR>
incapable of being a luddite, then it could be said to be aludditic, right?
<BR>
same for theism/atheism, i think... in short, i think atheism describes
<BR>
lack of belief in gods, not active disbelief in gods.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if looked at that way, atheism is not dogmatic at all, because it implies
<BR>
no specific belief, or even capability of belief. its just the lack of a
<BR>
specific belief... would it not be true to call you (for example) an
<BR>
aunicornist, or an aelvist (thats pretty clumsy), or an (i know, i'm making
<BR>
assumptions here... ;) anecrophilliac? does that make your position [/me
<BR>
narrowly avoids making necrophilliac puns] dogmatic?
