<EM>&gt; One wonders why, if exclusive self-seeking were as natural

<EM>&gt; as Rand insists, our Extropian individualists strive in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strained and histrionic way to exhibit this state?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are misunderstanding Rand here.  First off, her view is that
<BR>
selfishness -- at least, selfishness of the right sort is good and right.
<BR>
It might be read from some of her texts that selfishness is natural -- in
<BR>
that, the good or the right comes naturally to humans.  However, much of her
<BR>
writing was devoted to pointing out that the general culture she (and we)
<BR>
was (are) living in at best tolerates selfishness but only as a means to an
<BR>
end and typically holds it in derision.  I could go further into this, but I
<BR>
don't want this to turn into another Ayn Rand discussion list.  (See my web
<BR>
page for more on Rand, Objectivism, and the virtues of tar water.)
<BR>
<P>I agree, people can get a bit strained in broadcasting their views here.  In
<BR>
the current thread, however, one posted listed selfishness as a bad thing.
<BR>
Another post attacked the use of selfishness -- as if changing terms would
<BR>
hide actual meanings.  (I confess to doing the same thing in some contexts,
<BR>
just to get my ideas across -- to get in under someone's _internal_ thought
<BR>
police.  However, if you discuss this with someone long enough, she or he is
<BR>
eventually going to say, &quot;Hey, don't you really mean 'selfishness'?&quot;)
<BR>
<P>I think that's the reason for the strong reaction.  But I do think we all
<BR>
need to take a chill pill sometimes.  I don't think because someone
<BR>
disagrees with another person on this list that the universe will suddenly
<BR>
come to an end or even that, Lord forbid, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will be canceled.
<BR>
<P>In my defense, I've only questioned the listing of selfishness that way and
<BR>
my response was not histrionic -- though I don't think Robert was responding
<BR>
to me anyway.  (See my bit of self-quoting -- there's that &quot;self&quot; word
<BR>
again!:) -- below.)

<BR>
&quot;As expected, I disagree.  I see a lot of people sacrificing themselves
<BR>
selflessly, which, by its very definition is destructive.  I.e., sacrifice
<BR>
involves destruction.  I think if people really cared about themselves, they
<BR>
would not be stupid or destructive.&quot;  -- Daniel Ust, before the drugs began
<BR>
to take hold:)
