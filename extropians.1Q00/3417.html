<P>Not in this specific instance, but I would like to offer a useful heuristic.
<BR>
In human affairs we usually assume that something is impossible unless we
<BR>
can see how to do it, or unless we know it has been done.  This approach
<BR>
works pretty well because humans can easily imagine all kinds of things that
<BR>
they can't actually do, and surprising new discoveries are much less common
<BR>
that hair-brained schemes that don't work.
<BR>
<P>When speculating about strong SI, OTOH, I think we can get a better
<BR>
approximation of the truth by taking the opposite approach.  If we can't say
<BR>
for certain that something is forbidden by physical law, it seems reasonable
<BR>
to assume that an entity with 10^20 times the processing power of our entire
<BR>
species could find a way to do it.  After all, cases in which we fail to
<BR>
think of a solution that would seem obvious to an SI are going to be much
<BR>
more common that cases in which we actually test and rule out every approach
<BR>
that is allowed by physical law.
