Hi, everyone!
<BR>
<P>First I'd like to suggest the creation of a specific sub-list
<BR>
just for atheist extropians discuss their points of view... ( like
<BR>
there are &quot;european extropians list&quot;, and other)
<BR>
<P>Well, about the question &quot;Why am I an atheist?&quot;, the complete
<BR>
answer, in my case, involves many aspects, but that was for me the
<BR>
conclusion of a process that begun when I was still a christian,
<BR>
but parallely developing more and more my inteligence... Anyway,
<BR>
being an &quot;inteligent religious&quot; was a useful exercise for my mind,
<BR>
and I got interesting conclusions at that time that now can be translated
<BR>
as scientific &quot;feeling&quot;. For example, when thinking about god's supposed
<BR>
existence, I found he could not just be infinitely &quot;big&quot; but, to
<BR>
be so complete as he was supposed to be, he must be necessarily infinitely
<BR>
small, something like a differencial &quot;d(god)&quot; :) ... So his infinite
<BR>
counciousness would be able to access the intimity of the existence...
<BR>
Now I understand that I was just feeling the importance of &quot;nano&quot;
<BR>
&quot;femto&quot; &quot;atto&quot; etc. sciences for understanding the real existence
<BR>
of matter, energy, etc... the infinite universe itself... ( to be
<BR>
continued...)

<P><EM>  &gt;&gt;From: &quot;john grigg&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Robert, thank you for putting so well into words the value of religion in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;human lives.  You can say things so much better then I can.  Religion can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;be a healthy and powerful structure to achieve mental discipline and try to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;reach out to something greater then oneself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I am a former fundamentalist Christian, turned humanistic-rationalistic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agnostic.  What does that mean?  It means I’ve come to realize that there is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no possible way of rationally satisfying myself that “God” exists and so, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for me, his existence is irrelevant.  My efforts now center on trying to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;figure out a rational basis for my moral judgment and ethical behavior (no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easy feat).  On the one hand I am thankful for my years of religious study 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and training, as I believe it has imbedded in me some values that I find, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well, of value.  Stuff like loving your neighbor has become second nature 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for me, and I’m glad about that.  However, when I think of all the time I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent in church and studying what amount to ancient fairytales and behaving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a way that I hoped would be pleasing to God, rather than doing more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constructive things with my time, I do feel robbed of a good deal of my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When I think of the collective time and energy we spend behaving in ways 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that are not rationally ideally suited to deal with modern human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circumstances simply because that behavior conforms to the not-necessarily 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rational Judeo-Christian ethic, again I feel that we are being robbed.  For 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance, why all the fussing and fighting about gay marriage, teenage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contraception, abortion, euthanasia and legalizing marijuana (which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unquestionably has medicinal benefits and is less harmful than either 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alcohol or tobacco)?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;So, in some ways for me personally religion hath both given and taken away.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But, all things considered, I wish religion would just go away so that we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans could do what we do best...use our cognitive skills to solve our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems, rather than modifying our behavior to suit the whims of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-existent Old Man in the sky.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;-Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;--Thomas Jefferson
