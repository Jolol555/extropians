<EM>&gt; &gt; My wonderful life extension doctor recommends eating organic.  His
</EM><BR>
arguments
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are outlined in his book, &quot;Renewal:  The Anti-Aging Program,&quot; by Dr.
</EM><BR>
Timothy
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Smith.  There are many pages of references for anyone who wants to check
</EM><BR>
out
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the cites themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't read the book.  However, much of anti-aging &quot;science&quot; is working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the margins.   If they don't make distinctions of relative risks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (tobacco &gt;&gt; alcohol &gt;&gt; pesticides &gt;&gt; herbicides, etc.) and lump them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all together they are oversimplifying and trying to sell books without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving you a balanced presentation of the data.
</EM><BR>
<P>His book is for people who are very serious about life extension, and he
<BR>
advocates a very rigorous program (although he doesn't get into calorie
<BR>
restriction).
<BR>
<P>To reach a lay audience, a doctor must simplify his case, and he has to make
<BR>
some hard decisions about which things to include and which things to leave
<BR>
out.  Since Smith's core audience is the serious life extensionist, he
<BR>
doesn't even bother with tobacco, presumably because if you've gotten to his
<BR>
book you don't need to be told that it's dangerous.  He does cover the
<BR>
toxicity of alcohol in some detail.
<BR>
<P>I think his book, while generally good, could stand a little more balance,
<BR>
as he tends to pick one side and argue for it rather than weighing all of
<BR>
the evidence in turn.  But I don't think his motive is to sell books; the
<BR>
easy way to do that is to advocate a program that doesn't require a lot of
<BR>
lifestyle changes and promote questionable herbs a la Gary Null, who says
<BR>
that everyone should take licorice without mentioning that it raises blood
<BR>
pressure and cortisol levels.
<BR>
<P>Smith's book has 53 pages of citations.  I very much doubt that anything
<BR>
Null or Andrew Weill or the like has written is so thoroughly documented.
<BR>
(The number of citations, of course, doesn't prove that he's right, but it
<BR>
does show he at least agrees to the ground rules of scientific argument and
<BR>
has done some significant research to back up his claims.)
<BR>
<P>(I'm sure I'm biased, as I know Dr. Smith and I'm very impressed with him.
<BR>
I can't begin to imagine him cynically plotting to distort evidence to sell
<BR>
books.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For people who can afford it, going organic is perfectly fine.  However
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the probable benefits are probably slightly below taking one-a-day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vitamins.
</EM><BR>
<P>Those of us who already take dozens of exotic pills every day may have
<BR>
different risk/reward ratios than do people who don't worry about their
<BR>
health.
<BR>
<P>Note that those at risk for certain illnesses may also get greater benefits
<BR>
by going organic; women who have endometriosis or have it in their family
<BR>
may want to avoid dioxins, for example.  Preliminary studies show that
<BR>
dioxins may be the cause of endometriosis, though it's far from proven.
