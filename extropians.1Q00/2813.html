<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can suggest an alternative solution:
<BR>
<P>As each drug patent expires, the government declares the drug illegal,
<BR>
and collects taxes for additional jail space for the violators.
<BR>
Thus the government not only avoids obligatory purchases of generic
<BR>
drugs, but gains in both money and power; medical companies are
<BR>
assured of selling even insignificantly better (or even less
<BR>
efficient and more risky) drugs at the margins allowed by 
<BR>
exclusive patents.  As the people who would be incarcerated 
<BR>
for these crimes should usually be the types who value their
<BR>
own benefits over social discipline, they represent natural
<BR>
enemies to established coercive powers of all sorts, and
<BR>
probably engage in other risky and socially challenging behaviors,
<BR>
so their isolation won't be too commonly regretted (also taking
<BR>
into account that the yet unincarcerated population will be
<BR>
getting increasingly conservative)
<BR>
<P>You think it's cynical humor?
<BR>
Well, ok, maybe - creative exaggeration.
<BR>
But wait until multi-billion dollar benefits actually start pointing
<BR>
in that direction for government, FDA, and medical cartels.
<BR>
In some cases, the regulators may justly discover that the benefits
<BR>
were, under the pressure of not financial interests and not
<BR>
necessarily good research) unfairly valued over risks at the time
<BR>
when the drug was patented.
<BR>
At other times, it may be hard to tell the difference...
