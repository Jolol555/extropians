<P>
Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P>I am wondering how representative is the World Wide Web of what
<BR>
exists in the Real World? Do you think that the way that people
<BR>
behave in that medium is representative of their behavior in real
<BR>
life? I have participated in that &quot;experiment&quot; for the last 5 years
<BR>
by providing a large Web site with very valuable content (so I was
<BR>
told), and after these years, it's time for me to take a break from
<BR>
the Web for a while. I'm really cynical and jaded and disappointed
<BR>
in what I've learned about people who use the Web, so it's time to
<BR>
stop, and be &quot;empty&quot;, in that Zen way. I reached a kind of
<BR>
saturation point, I think.
<BR>
<P>Today, I wiped my Web site clean. All 25 Mb and 300+ files. I didn't
<BR>
give notice or put forwards on any of my pages, and I know that a
<BR>
few thousand people today (and every day for a while) may be a
<BR>
little bit unhappy.
<BR>
<P>One of my largest disappointments with the Web, was that folks who
<BR>
visited and wrote me often didn't connect that there is a real live
<BR>
human being, with a real life on the other side of those pages. They
<BR>
seldom were considerate or courteous. Since 90% of the folks that
<BR>
wrote me, wanted me to do something for them (help them with their
<BR>
homework, help them with their research project, give them other
<BR>
information, etc.), I would say that at least half didn't bother to
<BR>
address me by my name (those of you who saw my site know that my
<BR>
name was everywhere), or sign their own name, or even say &quot;please&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Many people also mistakenly thought that, because my Web pages were
<BR>
there for their use, that _I_ was a free resource for them too. One
<BR>
(college-age, I would say) person who wrote me a couple of years
<BR>
ago, bluntly told me: &quot;You should add compression links to your
<BR>
wavelet pages&quot;. When I wrote him back and said that &quot;if he pays me a
<BR>
lot of money, I will consider it&quot;, he sent me an indignant letter
<BR>
telling me how rude I was! I've also faced strangers calling me, or
<BR>
showing up at my door with their questions that they wanted me to
<BR>
answer. I know that the proper response is: &quot;My hourly fee is
<BR>
$XMegaBucks&quot;, perhaps we can discuss it then&quot;, but I was so
<BR>
surprised by their actions that I became flustered and annoyed, and
<BR>
I didn't think of a good response fast enough. I never thought that
<BR>
folks would have that audacity, yet they did.
<BR>
<P>Even when I made it quite clear in several texts at my site that I
<BR>
didn't have the &quot;resources&quot; (time, money, my old repetitive strain
<BR>
injury limited my computer usage, etc.), I still received alot of
<BR>
queries for my help. I suppose that those folks were in too much of
<BR>
a rush to read that, or to care.
<BR>
<P>Last year I put notice on some of my more active pages that I needed
<BR>
donations to help me with costs, since I am living on a student
<BR>
stipend, and it was difficult to maintain the pages. Out of the
<BR>
100,000 or so visits since I added my notice, only 6 people have
<BR>
donated money (none from any of the very wealthy corporations that I
<BR>
know use my site). While I am very appreciative of those 6 people's
<BR>
donations, something seemed really wrong with this.
<BR>
<P>Since I considered my Web pages the &quot;shape&quot; I gave myself in the
<BR>
World Wide Web, I always wondered what was &quot;enough&quot; information to
<BR>
give for my purposes, and what was &quot;too much&quot;. The phrase &quot;the map
<BR>
is not the territory&quot; seems particularly apt. I encountered some
<BR>
situations where some people figured that they &quot;knew&quot; Amara enough
<BR>
from my pages, and didn't need to ask me questions and learn in real
<BR>
life, who Amara was, and they proceeded to judge and criticize.
<BR>
In my opinion, those actions were laziness or fear-based, but those
<BR>
actions caused me quite a bit of grief, anyway. So I caution folks
<BR>
about how many &quot;pointers&quot; to give about oneself on their Web pages.
<BR>
And if you are as &quot;open&quot; as I am, then maybe the World Wide Web is
<BR>
the wrong forum, or maybe you should just provide a minimal
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P>I have to say that I really like how the Web enables people to meet
<BR>
each other from far-away places, but I also wonder if this extra
<BR>
media layer promotes a less-than-honest representation of oneself. I
<BR>
confess that I have a soft spot for bright, interesting people, who
<BR>
are offering me interesting conversational topics, stories, poetry,
<BR>
gifts...:-) , if I have the time, or I'm in town, etc. in order to
<BR>
read their messages, but I've encountered more than my share of
<BR>
people (OK, men), who don't describe who they are accurately, or who
<BR>
are unable to state what they want and need, even when I ask direct
<BR>
questions (and I am very direct). Several times I found myself in
<BR>
pretty painful situations because of that dishonesty. (Sometimes, I
<BR>
think that I'm too naive for the Web, or maybe even for the real
<BR>
world. That's why astronomy is a good field for me :-))
<BR>
<P>So while I hear about all of you transhumans &quot;moving on up&quot; and
<BR>
getting your positions and places visible on the World Wide Web,
<BR>
here is one jaded extrope who is &quot;moving on out&quot; and taking a break
<BR>
from the Web for a while.
<BR>
<P>Amara
