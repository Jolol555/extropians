<EM>&gt; Right.  Launching from a high altitude allows you to use a lighter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aeroshroud, but buys you surprisingly little other than that.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could launch from the top of Mt. Everest for example, the peak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dynamic pressure on the nose is less than a third what it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be if launched from the deck.  Depending on the type of rocket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that savings might be worthwhile in terms of payload capacity.
</EM><BR>
<P>The real advantage of high altitude launch is at the other end of the
<BR>
rocket- the expansion area ratio can be far higher, and the thrust goes
<BR>
up dramtically for the same mass flow rate.  This implies an increase in
<BR>
Isp- which reduces the mass ratio needed.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even if we HAD a tower right up to LEO, you would still have to spend approx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 80% of the energy (something in this neighborhood anyways) to get from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; top of that tower to a stable orbit at that altitude.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This isnt right tho.  Remember in the rockets it is momentum that is conserved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not energy.  Rockets are enormously wasteful of energy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  The overall thermodynamic efficiency of rockets can be as high
<BR>
as 50% -the kinetic energy of the total mass at high velocity is half of
<BR>
the chemical energy of the fuels on the launch pad (the best efficiency
<BR>
is at MR=5).  I have the derivation of this squirreled away somwwhere,
<BR>
I'll either dig it out or derive it again.
<BR>
<P>Decent rockets convert the heat energy in the chamber to kinetic energy
<BR>
of the exhaust at better than 80% Carnot efficiency- simply due to the
<BR>
*very* high upper temperature of the cycle, over 5500 Kelvin.  Typical
<BR>
vacuum cold gas thrusters are over 90% efficient, since the temperature
<BR>
drops from say, 300 K to around 20 K in a simple 200:1 nozzle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If a skyhook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existed, one could climb sufficiently high on it, then let go of the cable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and fall into orbit.  I just did a quick back of the envelope calc on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it looks like if you climb one Earth diameter up the cable and let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go, one would fall into a minimal orbit.  And, if you had an elevator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could climb a stationary cable, the energy expenditure would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a fraction of that expended by a rocket.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps an order of magnitude, not more.
<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Doug Jones has likely already jumped on this.  I havent downloaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for several hours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Got it...
