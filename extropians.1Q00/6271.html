<P>RED LIGHT CAMERS CAUSE DRAMATIC DROP IN VIOLATIONS:
<BR>
Metropolitan Police report red-light violations have dropped 60 percent at
<BR>
District of Columbia intersections where cameras designed to capture
<BR>
lawbreaking drivers on film have been installed. The program has been such a
<BR>
success that Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey is expanding the operation with at
<BR>
least 20 new red-light cameras and the installation of cameras that detect
<BR>
speeders. &quot;These programs are helping us improve traffic safety, while bringing
<BR>
in new revenue for the District,&quot; Chief Ramsey told the D.C. Council. Through
<BR>
the end of February, the city has collected more than $2.4 million in fines.
<BR>
Violators get a ticket in the mail for the indiscretion, at a cost of $75 a ticket
<BR>
plus two points on their license. Police officials said the highly automated
<BR>
system makes issuing the red-light violations easier, alerts distracted drivers
<BR>
more promptly and, apparently, serves as an effective deterrent. The firm
<BR>
handling the equipment, Lockheed Martin IMS, has installed 36 cameras at
<BR>
intersections throughout the city. Six more are pending, and Chief Ramsey
<BR>
wants to add 20 more after that. Lockheed makes about $26 from every ticket
<BR>
that is paid, and the city does not pay any money up front. The company
<BR>
controls the entire process, from installing the cameras to sending out the
<BR>
tickets. (Washington Times)
