<EM>&gt; I've come to the conclusion that ZDnet is nothing but the propaganda organ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of techno-fascists. Remember, they were the ones hyping the NC so much a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few years ago, until I suggested that too many underpowered machines in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offices would likely increase the rate of postal episodes at work...

<P>If the economies of scale had not turned PCs into NCs, the idea
<BR>
would have been good.  But you can't produce a low cost terminal
<BR>
for the price of a PC when your volumes are so much lower.
<BR>
That and the fact that the execution of the idea was highly
<BR>
mismanaged and motivated primarily by the desire to pull the
<BR>
rug out from under Microsoft made it a questionable business
<BR>
venture.  It was a high stakes game that became irrelevant when
<BR>
the web took off.
<BR>
<P>Larry made an interesting comment at the CATO conference
<BR>
last year I think.  The gist of it was that you should leave
<BR>
the configuration, management, backup, etc. of machines of non-IT
<BR>
people in the hands of IT &quot;professionals&quot;.  It was a MIS mentality,
<BR>
derived from the NC efforts and when I heard it I didn't like
<BR>
it.  But given the amount of time I spend installing, upgrading,
<BR>
debugging, etc. software, there is merit to the argument.
<BR>
I've spent the better part of the last 2 weeks upgrading
<BR>
to Win2K, reinstalling software, testing it, etc.  Now its
<BR>
great once you have it done, but for people who are from
<BR>
outside the industry it has got to be a nightmare.
<BR>
<P>Oh, and I don't know whether it was the trial that did it or
<BR>
whether Microsoft finally got it that the customer counts,
<BR>
but dealing with the Win2K support people is actually a
<BR>
*pleasant* experience.  Highly, highly unusual in the software
<BR>
industry.  Intel, still doesn't get it and they are claiming
<BR>
they aren't going to provide Win2K drivers for their early
<BR>
model USB cameras... (&quot;Buy our devices and we will make them
<BR>
obsolete for you!&quot;)...  I can't wait until I get their support
<BR>
manager on the phone and tell them every single machine I buy
<BR>
or any company I'm involved with buys for the next 50 years
<BR>
will *not* have Intel processors in them.  Vote with your $$$!
