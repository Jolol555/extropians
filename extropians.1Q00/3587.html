<EM>&gt; Gardner explains that there is far more to the human intellect then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical/analytical part which is of course, is very important but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These are the forms of intelligence that he recognizes, (from his website)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Musical Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is musical ability. Nothing wrong or demeaning about it, I admire great
<BR>
musical ability, there's a good bit in my family, but I won't call it
<BR>
'intelligence'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<P>Which was once called dexterity and co-ordination (or athletic ability). Nothing
<BR>
wrong with that ability, but its not intelligence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Logical-Mathematical Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linguistic Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Spatial Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<P>These are what were once considered the core abilities of our mind, and they are
<BR>
what the majority of our higher brain functions work on, and can be assigned to
<BR>
specific areas of the brain. The first is a left brain function and the other
<BR>
two are a right brain function.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interpersonal Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<P>Social skills. Not intelligence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Intrapersonal Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<P>Emotions. Not intelligence.
<BR>
<P>Using the example that Nadia posted about the children learning the earth's
<BR>
structure their own way, there is no way a person of any dominant ability is
<BR>
going to 'feel' their way to understanding plate tectonics, organic chemistry,
<BR>
or to writing great literature. There is no way a person can socialize their way
<BR>
to acheiving any of these either. You can't build a building with a sonnet, or
<BR>
by dancing a jig, or by crying your eyes out.
<BR>
<P>The reason for this 'multiple intelligence' scam is exactly what I say it is:
<BR>
Because all of the great permanent material acheivments in western civilization
<BR>
and technology are the result of real intelligence, and the modern 'outcome'
<BR>
based educational system seems to think that in order to make children without
<BR>
high or above average levels of real intelligence feel 'good' about themselves,
<BR>
they need to call all human abilities 'intelligences'. Just because I feel that
<BR>
way does not mean those other abilities are not worthwhile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Gardner has never ruled out the possibility that additional intelligences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may also exist, for MI research is still in its infancy.  Recently, he added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an eighth intelligence to the list: the Naturalist Intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>oh goody, tree hugging now has its own Olympic event. Confirmation of what I say
<BR>
is true: pure PC crap.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also been some consideration of a ninth intelligence - existential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence - but the jury is still out on that one. Besides, for now at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least, a great deal of new understanding may be found from within these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eight faculties.
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean if I feel that I am more here than others that I'm much smarter in my
<BR>
'existential intelligence'?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gardner continues...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding the conventional theory of intelligence, Gardner wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WHEN ONE IS ASKED to consider the question &quot;What makes a person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent?,&quot; the most common responses will often note a person's ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to solve problems, utilize logic, and think critically.  These typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traits of intelligence are sometimes lumped together under the lable of &quot;raw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A person's intelligence, traditionally speaking, is contained in his or her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general intellect - in otherwords, how each and every one of us comprehend,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examine, and respond to outside stimuli, whether it be to solve a math
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem correctly or to anticipate an opponent's next move in a game of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tennis.  Our intelligence, therefore, is our singular, collective ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; act and react in an ever-changing world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P>I would posit that the seven 'intelligences' that Gradner defines are more
<BR>
accurately compared to I/O channels to the individuals core intelligence. To
<BR>
compare to computers, one computer may use a scanner better because it has a
<BR>
faster SCSI card, while another may use a CCD camera better because its video
<BR>
card is better, etc. This concept is supported by the fact that most people who
<BR>
are very capable in one of these areas, is typically relatively equally capable
<BR>
in other areas as well, and those with very poor areas tend to not have any high
<BR>
areas as well. It is a rare case where you get savant behavior, in which only
<BR>
one I/O channel functions extremely efficiently with a genius mind, but the
<BR>
other channels are stunted to uslessness and impairment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I look forward to further discussion on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sincerely,
</EM><BR>
