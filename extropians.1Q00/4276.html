<P>
There was a long (and acrimonious) discussion of aircars in
<BR>
sci.space.policy about a year ago... the most interesting item was a
<BR>
straightforward scheme for traffic control that eliminated high speed
<BR>
merging problems.  I can't recall who originated it.
<BR>
<P>In the simplest instantiation, heading is a function of altitude,
<BR>
incrementing by .25 degree for each meter relative to a zero datum.  As
<BR>
a skycar climbs, it turns to its right- if ascending at ten meters/s
<BR>
(about 2000 FPM), this is slightly slower than a two-minute turn. 
<BR>
Descending traffic turns to its left- *and all vehicles at a given
<BR>
altitude travel on parallel paths.*  The only opportunities for
<BR>
collision are during ascent and descent, handled by relatively simple
<BR>
&quot;flocking&quot; algorithms to resolve conflicts.
<BR>
<P>All traffic is point-to-point, no &quot;airways&quot; to unnaturally concentrate
<BR>
vehicles into limited airspace.  With the high power-to-weight ratios
<BR>
needed for VTOL flight, acceleration to cruising speed is rapid. 
<BR>
Additional layers of traffic allow higher speeds, and speed can also be
<BR>
a function of altitude, so that all cars at a given altitude are
<BR>
motionless relative to one another.  Flight planning incorporates
<BR>
offsets to compensate for the helical paths at the ends, and special
<BR>
rules for local problems (like skyscrapers) can be patched in.
<BR>
<P>The system requires navigation of differential GPS quality, but control
<BR>
is distributed and automated, and conflict resolution is local and
<BR>
simple.
