<BR>
<EM> &gt; From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20SOC:%20Opposition%20to%20Transhumanism&In-Reply-To=&lt;3878A811.61DB@geocities.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt; People who blow things up tend to become disliked and feared by the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; large majority of people, who actually considers it a sign of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; dangerous fanaticism or mental illness. Reasonable people with values
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; many people subscribe to, on the other hand, can influence them greatly.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but the direct damage caused by, for example, someone
<BR>
blowing up a transhumanist conference or cryonics faclility would
<BR>
be very severe, even if the long(er)-term effects could in fact be
<BR>
positive.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; The man in the above example clearly lacks some crucial data.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; He is a specialist, and has trouble with looking beyond his own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; narrow field of interest. He can't see the big picture, lacks
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; vision. A very common problem (even on this list).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; How did you reach that conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<P>I applied Occam's Razor :-)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Note that in the above example it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is not said that he lacks cruicial data (of course, he might lack
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; them) but rather that given his prior knowledge his estimation of thje
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; likeliehood of various effects differs from our estimation.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, the example wasn't detailed enough for a truly solid
<BR>
conclusion either way, but &quot;specialist bias&quot; seemed like a
<BR>
fair educated guess.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Saying that all opponents to transhumanism are either misinformed or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; illogical is a great way of isolating oneself into an ideological air
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; castle isolated from reality. I have seen people taking this view in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; defending everything from communism to objectivism, and the results
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have always been bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, like I said: I'm yet to hear relevant criticism of core
<BR>
transhumanist beliefs. I don't think that such criticism will
<BR>
*ever* be forthcoming, but that doesn't mean that I'm not
<BR>
prepared to listen to opponent's arguments. Of course there
<BR>
are flaws in individual transhumanists' thinking (*), and
<BR>
perhaps some small fringe flaws in the philosophy itself, but
<BR>
the core, i.e. that we should overcome the limitations on our
<BR>
freedom by rational means, is &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;eternal&quot;.
<BR>
<P>No matter what your philosophy is, there will always be one
<BR>
or more dogmas at its core. This is inevitable, and by no
<BR>
means bad by defintion; in the absence of a universal
<BR>
&quot;meaning of life&quot; we must create our own meaning. Seeking
<BR>
freedom and happiness for now and for all times is currently
<BR>
the most logical choice. Call it a dogma if you will, so what?
<BR>
If someone doesn't agree, well, let him suffer and die in
<BR>
oppression then, if that's what he really wants. It's his
<BR>
loss, not mine.
<BR>
<P>(*) mainly naive technophilia.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; That person would not accept your view that the universe is changing -
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the underlying essence for example might be eternal and unchanging and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the apparent change an illusion. A philosophical view a great deal of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; people have taken, however much we might disagree with them. It cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; even be refuted, which makes it silly from a popperian empiricist
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; view, but these people do not even feel they have to subscribe to that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; view. People with a different ontology and epistemology can be awfully
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hard to convince that you are right...
</EM><BR>
<P>Arguments which are not based on reason can (and should, for
<BR>
practical purposes) be ignored. You might as well say that
<BR>
transhumanism is wrong because the cosmic pink elephant
<BR>
says so, or because it's against the leprechaun way of life.
<BR>
Can't be refuted, can't be substantiated, but *can* be ignored.
