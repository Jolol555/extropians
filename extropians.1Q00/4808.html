<EM>&gt; Whatever happened to so-called 'anti-gravity technology?'  I remember seeing

<EM>&gt; old newsreels showing researchers flying several feet of the ground on what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought were devices that projected strong magnetic fields.  Where is this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research now?

<P>John, you have to allow that &quot;magic physics&quot; just doesn't pan out.
<BR>
Cruise missles presumably do fly at their altitude limits given
<BR>
the available ground mappings.  However human-powered aircraft
<BR>
performance is way below that due to slower human reaction times.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The present military mindset of the pentagon does seem to be very forward 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking.  I know they love to write reports about 'war in 2020' a great 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The military has had a fascination with pilot-less weapon platforms 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for awhile and now the tech is getting here to makes such things a reality.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Go Bolo!  For the glory of the Corps!! :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps. but you also have to wrestle with funding for &quot;people-controlled'
<BR>
vehicles vs. autonomous robots.  Autonomous robots will ultimately win
<BR>
but it wil only provide a limited picture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also see a natural process 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on that will ultimately lead to nano-warfare.  And I am sure the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pentagon already has reports written on the big picture! lol
</EM><BR>
<P>If the public-speak matches the private-think they are clueless.
