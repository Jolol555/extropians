<BR>
M O N T R E A L, Jan. 29 — After negotiations late into the night, delegates 
<BR>
reached an international agreement today on the trade of genetically modified 
<BR>
food and other products.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before dawn, Colombia’s environment minister Juan Mayr announced to 
<BR>
a conference hall full of delegates that the yearlong stalemate had ended.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The adoption of this protocol represents a victory for the 
<BR>
environment,” Mayr said, fighting back tears. “But don’t forget that this 
<BR>
only represents the beginning. We have still before us a great challenge.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Biosafety Protocol to the U.N. Convention on Biodiversity provides 
<BR>
rules intended to protect the environment from damage by genetically modified 
<BR>
plants, animals and bacteria.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protocol allows a country to ban imports of a genetically modified 
<BR>
product if it feels there is not enough scientific evidence showing the 
<BR>
product is safe. It also provides rules for the transport and labeling, 
<BR>
requiring that the words “may contain living modified organisms” appear on 
<BR>
all shipments of genetically altered commodities, such as corn and cotton. 
<BR>
Environmentalists Are Happy 
<BR>
“The text is good from our point of view—very good,” said Adrian Bebb, an 
<BR>
environmental activist with Friends of the Earth.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised concerns that 
<BR>
genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species, disrupt natural 
<BR>
cycles and cause other ecological damage.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union and developing nations argued that countries should 
<BR>
be allowed to refuse imports of a genetically modified product if little is 
<BR>
known about its environmental effect.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the United States and its partners disagreed, saying many of the 
<BR>
proposed rules would restrict trade.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. negotiators said Saturday that they were satisfied with the final 
<BR>
agreement.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On balance we think this is an agreement that protects the environment 
<BR>
without disrupting world food trade,” said head U.S. delegate David Sandalow.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations stretched hours beyond Friday night’s deadline as delegates 
<BR>
struggled over the intricacies of the deal. 
<BR>
<P>This Story Was Genetically Modified 
<BR>
In one of the main compromises, the United States and its supporters were 
<BR>
able to amend rules that would have required labels to give specific details 
<BR>
on what genetically modified materials are in a product.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the compromise, for two years after the protocol comes into 
<BR>
effect, labels must say only that a product may contain such materials, 
<BR>
without specifics. During those two years, negotiators will work out more 
<BR>
specific labels.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiators also reached a compromise on the thorny issue of how the 
<BR>
protocol would relate to the World Trade Organization. After months of debate 
<BR>
over which treaty should prevail, it was finally decided that the two should 
<BR>
be “mutually supportive,” with a specific statement in the document 
<BR>
declaring that nothing in it is “intended to subordinate this Protocol to 
<BR>
other international agreements.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Hardstaff, a trade expert with the Royal Society for the 
<BR>
Protection of Birds, said that wording effectively leaves the relationship 
<BR>
between the two treaties to the WTO’s dispute resolution panel.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is continuing the muddle about trade versus international 
<BR>
environmental protection,” Hardstaff said. 
<BR>
<P>Anti-GM Consensus Has Grown 
<BR>
Talks last February in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in disarray when the United 
<BR>
States and five other countries—Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile and 
<BR>
Uruguay—rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has changed since then, with major U.S. food producers 
<BR>
such as Archer Daniels Midland, Gerber and the Iams pet food company either 
<BR>
demanding that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use 
<BR>
them altogether. Protests at the WTO talks in Seattle last month also suggest 
<BR>
that the American public has concerns about genetically altered food.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In the year since Cartagena, it has become obvious that the position of 
<BR>
the (United States’) group is increasingly isolated,” said Philip Bereano, a 
<BR>
University of Washington professor who has been following the talks.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million 
<BR>
acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In 
<BR>
the United States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 
<BR>
percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans.
