In response to Queenemuse posting Frank Zappa lyrics which she compared to 
<BR>
Garth's &quot;We shall be free,&quot; I have posted Brook's lyrics here.  This is one 
<BR>
of my all time favorite songs, without question.  It brings up injustices I 
<BR>
think about alot.  For the country music industry (and the music industry in 
<BR>
general) these lyrics are very powerful.  It took me a long time to even 
<BR>
find the lyrics due to Garth's recording company going after website owners 
<BR>
with lawsuits  but the net is a big place! :)
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;We Shall Be Free&quot;
<BR>
<P>This aint comin from no prophet
<BR>
Just an ordinary man
<BR>
When I close my eyes I see
<BR>
The way this world shall be
<BR>
When we all walk hand in hand
<BR>
<P>When the last child cries for a crust of bread
<BR>
When the last man dies for just words that he said
<BR>
When there's shelter over the poorest head
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
<P>When the last thing we notice is the color of skin
<BR>
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within
<BR>
When the skies and the oceans are clean again
<BR>
Then we shall be free
<BR>
<P>We shall be free
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
Stand straight, walk proud
<BR>
'Cause we shall be free
<BR>
<P>When we're free to love anyone we choose
<BR>
When this worlds big enough for all different views
<BR>
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew
<BR>
Then we shall be free
<BR>
<P>We shall be free
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
Have a little faith
<BR>
Hold out
<BR>
'Cause we shall be free
<BR>
<P>And when money talks for the very last time
<BR>
And nobody walks a step behind
<BR>
When there's only one race and thats mankind
<BR>
Then we shall be free
<BR>
<P>We shall be free
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
Stand straigt,
<BR>
walk proud,
<BR>
have a little faith,
<BR>
hold out
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
<P>We Shall be free
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
Stand straight,
<BR>
have a little faith
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
<P>We shall be free
<BR>
We shall be free
<BR>
<P><P>Queenemuse in quoting Zappa lyrics wrote:
<BR>
There will come a time when everybody who is lonely will be free to sing and 
<BR>
dance and love (dance and love.)
<BR>
There will come a time when every evil that we know will be an evil that we 
<BR>
can rise above (rise above)
<BR>
Who cares if you;re so poor you can't afford to buy a pair of 
<BR>
Mod-a-Gogostretch elastic pants.
<BR>
There will comea a time when you won't even be ashamed if you can't dance.  
<BR>
WA WA WA WAAAAA
<BR>
There will come a time when everybody who is lonely will be free to sing and 
<BR>
dance and love (dance and love.)
<BR>
There will come a time when every evil that we know will be an evil that we 
<BR>
can rise above (rise above)
<BR>
Who cares if hair is long or short are frayed or slightly grayed we know 
<BR>
That hair ain't where it's at!
<BR>
There will come a time when you won't even be ashamed if you are fat!  WA WA 
<BR>
WA WA(Frank Zappa)
<BR>
(compare to Garth Brook’s song)
