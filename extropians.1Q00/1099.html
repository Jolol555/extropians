<EM>&gt; Experience: I am acquainted with a bright child who had not, at the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vegetarian.  Her parents judged that it was not yet the time, and I,

<P>Big mistake.  I would say that being raised in a &quot;sheltered environment&quot;
<BR>
(middle class-America) is in a fairly direct way responsible for costing
<BR>
me amounts ranging from 6 to 7 figures.  It may have also have exposed me
<BR>
to one or more life-threatening situations that I was ill-prepared to deal
<BR>
with.  Sheltering individuals (children or adults) from the harsh realities
<BR>
that exist does nothing more than hinder their overall chances for survival.
<BR>
One potentially preserves their naivete at the possible expense of their
<BR>
lives.  Its sucking up to the parents at the expense of the child.  Never
<BR>
avoid a chance to show individuals (children or adults) that &quot;nature&quot;
<BR>
(whether its the natural kind or a human environment) -- may simply
<BR>
&quot;not care&quot;.  If you want to be a bit harsher, don't hesitate to demonstrate
<BR>
that its dog-eat-dog as well.
