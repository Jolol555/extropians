<P><P><EM>&gt; All this talk of recumbents is making me excited!!  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The $800 pricetag is steep but possible for me.  How much more is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it? 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The cost of the complete power kit (battery, charger, motor) from ZAP is
<BR>
$360 to $475, depending on the model.  I don't remember if that includes
<BR>
shipping.  The URL is

<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I am going to have to learn if this type of bike is sold in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anchorage.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The motor kit is normally bought separately from the bike.  The kit would
<BR>
need to be installed on whatever bike you want to use.  It would be wise
<BR>
to check the specific installation requirements for the specific bike on
<BR>
which you intend to use the motor before selecting and buying one of the
<BR>
four models of motor kit.  A bicycle repair shop could advise you, and
<BR>
they would probably charge at least $50 to do the installation.  An auto
<BR>
mechanic could also probably install the kit.
<BR>
<P><P>Can 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a person do crosscountry touring on one of these?  I could ride down 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Alcan with it! lol!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best regards,
</EM><BR>

<P><P>It most definitely would not allow cross-country touring by a rider
<BR>
dependent on the motor-assist.  The idea of an electric motor powered by
<BR>
a lead-acid storage battery to run a bike is not very practical.  The
<BR>
range is very limited unless the rider is doing all the work.  This would
<BR>
only be a good idea for someone who needs or wants to ride a bike
<BR>
locally, say a couple of miles back and forth to a nearby grocery store,
<BR>
and who yet cannot pedal a bike that far.  For someone who can pedal a
<BR>
bike, the motor is really unnecessary.
<BR>
<P><P>ZAP's standard battery sells for $100, and it looks like it has a
<BR>
capacity of about 20 or 30 Amp-hours (assuming it's 12 volts), though
<BR>
they don't specify its charge capacity.  Now if you got a couple of big
<BR>
60 Amp-hour marine deep cycle batteries, which would weigh at a guess 80
<BR>
lbs., and mounted them on a three-wheel bike, then you might get a 20 to
<BR>
30 mile run out of one charge, at a guess.  But it would still be a poor
<BR>
substitute for a motorcycle, based on performance.  You live in Anchorage
<BR>
- lead acid batteries do not perform well at cold temperatures.
