<EM>&gt; 1. This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical care and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longevity can both be financed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also agree.  $100 million can disappear pretty fast when you think of how
<BR>
big the world is.  Think of a nation like India -- one of about 1 billion
<BR>
people.  $100 million is ten cents per person there.  Surely, not every last
<BR>
Indian is poor, but I bet enough of them are that $100 million would amount
<BR>
to very little healthcare expenditure for any of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Longevity research may well advance &quot;normal&quot; medical care in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that purely investing in &quot;normal&quot; medical care would never accomplish.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, if one were to find a generic vaccine that made humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immune to most or all viruses, that would have immediate applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toward preventing people from getting sick - but such is much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to be discovered by researchers looking to minimize health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems over infinite lives, as opposed to researchers looking to just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let people live long enough to die at 60 or 70.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also agree.  Sadly, though, right now, convention medicine is lax to latch
<BR>
onto advances made outside of pharmaceuticals.  This might be a PR problem
<BR>
as well as plain old inertia.  After all, most supplements lack the
<BR>
promotional funding behind them that patented perscription medicines have --
<BR>
mainly because profits are lower.  (I'm only sticking to this example
<BR>
because there do seem to be lots of clear cut examples of, e.g., vitamins
<BR>
which are great at treated certain diseases and conditions, but people with
<BR>
those diseases and conditions are usually not told by their regular doctor
<BR>
to take them -- either with or without conventional courses of treatment.
<BR>
This doesn't even get into prevention.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4. For the past several centuries, there have been some in the world who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have lived better than the others.  One way to introduce immortality for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone would be to introduce it for the rich first, then as time goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on - and the technology becomes more familiar and (one hopes)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simpler/less expensive - introduce it to everyone else.  (&quot;Poverty&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these days is not quite as hard a life as &quot;poverty&quot; was 100 years ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least in almost any industrialized country, due in part to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice.)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is most likely what will happen, though I feel it won't be as expensive
<BR>
as previously.  Nowadays, despite complaints of the high cost of healthcare,
<BR>
more people have access to it and more people are engaging in the latest
<BR>
treatments, conventional or otherwise.  This is not to say things couldn't
<BR>
be better --don't get me started on this! -- but that we don't live in a
<BR>
society where only the richest of the rich can afford the latest
<BR>
breakthroughs.  So, I think advances, especially those in longevity, will
<BR>
spread more rapidly than previous advances have.
<BR>
<P>Case in point: An older friend of mine (40 some odd years old) who is doing
<BR>
well, but by no means rich, is already going to a longevity clinic.  Also,
<BR>
I'm very far from rich:/ and I try to keep up and get stuff -- tests,
<BR>
supplements, etc. -- I can deal with in my budget.  Granted, I'm no Third
<BR>
World peasant, but I'm not part of that so called elite that controls and
<BR>
owns the planet.:)
