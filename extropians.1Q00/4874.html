</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property. I'm having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fun with those bozos right now on alt.anarchy. They don't understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I've painted them into a paradox. They either have to acknowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property rights or admit that they beleive that individuals are slaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the group.
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea that anti-patent arguments are anti-property has been
<BR>
debunked here so many times that using it is dishonest.
<BR>
<P>As I have pointed out here before, it is the patent concept that is
<BR>
a socialist one--it derives from the labor theory of value--the
<BR>
discredited idea that work is valuable in itself.  Just because an
<BR>
inventor does work, that's no reason to assume it is valuable, any
<BR>
more than a craftsman making artifacts no one wants.  Value is
<BR>
created by demand; if an inventor creates something to meet the
<BR>
demands of the market, he will make money.  If others also fulfill
<BR>
demands by using his invention, they make money too.  None of that
<BR>
justifies the inventor using state guns to prevent others from also
<BR>
profiting from his invention.  The state should protect your
<BR>
property, because when others use it, you can't.  The state has no
<BR>
business protecting your ideas.  If others can use them to profit
<BR>
more than you do, it is because they fulfill needs better than you
<BR>
and deserve to profit more--after all, you have more intimate
<BR>
knowledge of your ideas than they do--if you can't profit from
<BR>
that, you're doing something wrong.
