<P>
<EM>&gt; The study of consciousness is burdened by too much speculative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy, and not enough empirical science.  It's important to observe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real-life examples of many seemingly theoretical states of consciousness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important for cryonics and uploading already exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no question that empirical science must continue to take topics and
<BR>
problems away from philosophy.  I disagree, though, with some of your
<BR>
comparisons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1.  &quot;zombies&quot;: sleepwalkers are nearly fully functional but not in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware state of consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P>The metaphorical application of this term to sleepwalkers does not
<BR>
necessarily have anything important to do with the term as used in
<BR>
philosophy.  In the literature [zombie] is used to refer to a theoretical
<BR>
entity which, according to a standard-looking definition,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behaves like us and may share our functional organization and even,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps, our neurophysiological makeup without conscious experiences or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualia. (<A HREF="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/Z.html">http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/Z.html</A>)
<BR>
<P>It's referring to the basic design of a mind, not to a particular operation
<BR>
of a conscious mind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. cloning of consciousness: experiments on split brain patients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (slicing through the corpus collosum) seem to indicate that something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like two conscious entities, one verbal and observable, the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonverbal and difficult (but not impossible) to observe, exist in such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.  This suggests that the boundaries between conscious minds are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused by the relative connectedness of the computing networks which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create those minds.
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume that you are comparing this to discussion about uploading, which
<BR>
could be considered a sort of (mind-)cloning.  That too is a very different
<BR>
notion than split-brain surgery, which involves gross modification of a
<BR>
mind.  Simply the fact that some split-brain patients appear to have two
<BR>
independent selves does not suggest a comparison to the multiple minds
<BR>
resulting from upload procedures.
