<P>Because, broadly speaking, you're right.

<P>I'm not anti-nuclear. What I am is skeptical that the technology can
<BR>
be made cost-effective and useful in places like the USA and UK, while
<BR>
current political constraints apply. Maybe in another generation public
<BR>
attitudes will have shifted: I expect the real oil crunch will lead to
<BR>
a turn-around in the public perception of nuclear power when it bites,
<BR>
especially if the current military trend away from weapons of mass
<BR>
destruction and towards precision-guided weapons continues.
<BR>
<P>But I'm also unhappy about the way the civil side of the industry is
<BR>
run -- little things like BNFL inspectors forging QA test reports on
<BR>
fuel rods delivered to customers in Germany and Japan do not fill me
<BR>
with warm fuzzies. You could say, with justification, that this is a
<BR>
management problem, and I'd be bound to agree, but I think it reflects
<BR>
an underlying malaise in the way the industry is run from the top down.
