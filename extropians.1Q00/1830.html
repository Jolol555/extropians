<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can stabilize muons by Fermi blocking.  (This is how neutrons in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neutron stars are stabilized.)  All this requires is that the muons be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confined inside a degenerate Fermi gas of electrons, with a Fermi level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;higher than the kinetic energy of an electron produced in muon decay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since muons have a mass of 106 MeV, you need a Fermi level about that high.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So you need a k_F around 0.5 fm^-1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That would require an electron density of about 4 X 10^36 electrons/cm^3.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To get an idea of this order of magnitude, that gas would have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mass density of about 4 X 10^9 g/cm^3 in electrons *alone*, not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all of the nuclei you'd need to squish together to neutralize the charge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, short of a neutron star (or stable strange matter), you're never going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to stabilize muons in a lab.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Muons are about 200 times heavier than electrons. I think tensile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strength will scale as the fourth power of that ratio, density as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the third power, and melting point linearly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The strength/weight ratio and the free-hanging length will scale linearly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IIRC, diamond has a free-hanging length of about 1000 miles, so muon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter will have a free-hanging length of about 200,000 miles.     
</EM><BR>
<P>Which leads me to daydream aloud on the Extropians list:
<BR>
<P>Muon matter could be a very useful high-density substrate for computation
<BR>
if it could be stabilized. It's nearly as dense as degenerate matter, so
<BR>
it should in principle be possible to achieve outrageously high switching
<BR>
speeds. Lightspeed signal propagation delays should be a lot less significant,
<BR>
too, everything being so much closer together. (As far as circuit design
<BR>
goes, it's a bit like the consequences of raising the speed of light.)
<BR>
<P>Now, the conditions Paul Shocklee observerd are required for Fermi
<BR>
blocking are outrageous by normal environmental standards, but they _do_
<BR>
sound achievable for the surface layers of a neutron star. I don't have
<BR>
adequate references to hand, but would a red dwarf or black dwarf also
<BR>
suffice? If so, that environment might be accessible to assembler-built
<BR>
tools controlled by an MB. Instead of needing to employ starlifting to
<BR>
get extra material for use in an MB, the MB could directly colonise the
<BR>
stellar remnant. The issue of how then to generate large amounts of muon
<BR>
matter stabilized by Fermi blocking is ... interesting, but I'm happy
<BR>
to leave the details to a Matrioshka Brain ;-)
<BR>
<P>The point here is that an MB that extends all the way down _into_ the surface
<BR>
of a black dwarf has access to vastly more structured matter for computation
<BR>
purposes -- 10 to 1000 Jovian masses doesn't seem unreasonable -- and also
<BR>
doesn't suffer from the same sort of lightspeed propagation lag as an MB 
<BR>
with dimensions measured in AU's. So it can think _faster_ than a normal
<BR>
MB, and probably has more resources at its disposal -- in return for being
<BR>
stuck at the bottom of a very deep gravity well.
<BR>
<P>Is this feasible in principle, or am I missing something?
