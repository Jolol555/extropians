I did a little detective work on the net and found that Eliezer must be 
<BR>
talking about the Foresight Institute's gathering for senior associates.  
<BR>
This is not cheap!  Even if you sign up as an &quot;early bird&quot; the cost is $395! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's another $105 for a room.  I can see how Eliezer is happy about 
<BR>
having a &quot;patron&quot; who helped him out.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that the three big events for any transhumanist are the 
<BR>
Foresight Institute Senior Associate Gathering, the Extropian Institute 
<BR>
Extro and the Alcor life extension conference.  And I am sure there must be 
<BR>
several other events I have not listed.  I nearly forgot the highrollers 
<BR>
gathering for cryonicists put on by Don Laughlin!
<BR>
<P>I have set a goal for myself to attend the 2000 Extro, no matter what.  I 
<BR>
want to meet the people behind the posts.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
