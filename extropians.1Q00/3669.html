I was called upon this week to judge an elementary school
<BR>
science fair.  Fascinating experience, considering the thread
<BR>
we had on teaching children appropriate values.
<BR>
<P>While there, they did the traditional pledge of allegiance,
<BR>
but it was followed by a new chant which I had never heard,
<BR>
and I wondered if it is a California thing or is it ubiquitous.  It
<BR>
follows immediately upon the old familiar flag pledge, without
<BR>
a pause, so the students dont realize it is actually two different
<BR>
things.  As I recall it goes something like this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I will respect others, seek out wise people, give up put downs,
<BR>
yakkity yak, bla bla, something something, I will make right past
<BR>
wrongs.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Does anyone have kids in elementary school who say this little
<BR>
jingle?  Could you post it?  spike
