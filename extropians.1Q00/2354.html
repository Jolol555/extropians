<EM>&gt; I adore ziploc bags! When I travel to the States, I always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send some boxes of ziplocs back to Germany, because I cannot find them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here. My latest shipment arrived last week. Some of you extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over in the States might consider starting a side business selling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those plastic wonders to us ziploc-deprived foreigners.

<P>There isn't much of a market for it because overseas they are a
<BR>
little more relaxed about drug use compared to to the U.S. police.
<BR>
They just wouldn't sell in the Netherlands for example.

<P>Only if you've found a use for them that the rest of us are unaware of....
<BR>
<P>Are you perhaps saving all of the leftovers from the activities of
<BR>
the apotemnophiliacs???  Not a bad idea perhaps, you could send them
<BR>
over to Eugene and we could get some electromicrographs to see which
<BR>
individuals actually sharpened their tools before using them.

<P>Remember the Carpenter's rule, measure twice, cut once.
