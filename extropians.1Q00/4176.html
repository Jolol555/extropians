I have built a terrain integrated, earth quake proof, storm proof and 
<BR>
fireproof house in the Colorado Rockies. He is stored on our property there 
<BR>
in a dryice box. And we have hired a local entrepreneur to add 900 lbs of 
<BR>
dry ice every 3 weeks.

<P>I know of this project of your's from television!  But was did you have 
<BR>
Alcor or CI remove the blood and pump cryoprotectants into him?  Or did you 
<BR>
try to manage it yourself?  Or did you simply freeze him and hope for the 
<BR>
best?
<BR>
<P>I really enjoyed your post to those who responded to you.  I have read alot 
<BR>
of &quot;talk&quot; on extropian ventures to develop independant communities but you 
<BR>
really have a handle on it.
<BR>
<P>I appreciated your knowledge of the nature of profit and depreciation in 
<BR>
regards to ships.  I had already known about the seagoing 
<BR>
&quot;multi-millionaire's community&quot; on a cruiseship.  But the basic idea could 
<BR>
be used for transhumanist's also.  If only there were a billionaire patron 
<BR>
among us to sponsor such a project!  What would the minimum cost be of such 
<BR>
a project?
<BR>
<P>It's nice to know that piracy is not a big worry.  It makes sense that the 
<BR>
large cargo vessals with small crews would be the main targets for what few 
<BR>
&quot;professional&quot; pirates are still out there.
<BR>
They would not have much of a chance against a bunch of well-armed 
<BR>
extropians!
<BR>
<P>I am glad that the nature of seagoing maritime laws would allow us to have a 
<BR>
good chance of preserving our liberty and not be violated by nation-state's 
<BR>
that wanted to meddle in our interests.  Of course, if Eliezer is doing 
<BR>
serious A.I./singularity research, we just might have the marines of several 
<BR>
countries pay us a visit! lol
<BR>
