<A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/BMGT/.Faculty/JSimon/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR18.txt">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/BMGT/.Faculty/JSimon/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR18.txt</A>

<P><EM>&gt;1945: DDT, sensationalized by Rachel Carson in 1962. Said to cause 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hepatitis. Discontinued in U.S. in 1972. Known then to be safe to humans 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(caused death only if eaten like pancakes). Some damage to wildlife under 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;special conditions. With the aid of DDT, &quot;India had brought the number of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;malaria cases down from the estimated 75 million in 1951 to about 50,000 in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1961. Sri Lanka...reduced malaria from about three million cases after 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;World War II to just 29 in 1964&quot;. Then as the use of DDT went down, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Endemic malaria returned to India like the turnaround of a tide&quot;. By 1977 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;the number of cases reached at least 30 million and perhaps 50 million&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 1971, amidst the fight that led to the banning of DDT in 1972, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;president of the National Academy of Science - distinguished biologist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Philip Handler - said &quot;DDT is the greatest chemical that has ever been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discovered&quot;. Commission after commission, top expert after top Nobel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prize-winning expert, has given DDT a clean bill of health.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like most people, I suppose, I think of DDT as a dangerous
<BR>
poison. The passage above asserts that it's safe for humans
<BR>
and suggests that the post-Sixties resurgence of malaria has
<BR>
something to do with the banning of DDT in the USA. A little
<BR>
research shows that it had everything to do with the growth
<BR>
in pesticide resistance, and nothing to do with pesticide
<BR>
politics.
<BR>
<P>Reasons for the resurgence of malaria:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/medical_notes/newsid_120000/120644.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/medical_notes/newsid_120000/120644.stm</A>
<BR>
Pesticide resistance, growth of mosquito breeding grounds,
<BR>
expansion of human settlement into malaria-friendly areas,
<BR>
budget restraints. No reference to environmentalist scaremongering
<BR>
as a factor.
<BR>
<P>DDT's use in India:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.miyazaki-mic.ac.jp/students/class02/ehyotani/India_Pesticide.html">http://www.miyazaki-mic.ac.jp/students/class02/ehyotani/India_Pesticide.html</A>
<BR>
states that pesticide production in India peaked in the 1980s, and
<BR>
DDT was banned there only in 1997, long after the resurgence quoted
<BR>
above.
<BR>
<P>DDT's effects on human health:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_262000/262698.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_262000/262698.stm</A>
<BR>
'Some of the recent scientific findings summarised in the report
<BR>
provide evidence that DDT can damage the developing brain, causing
<BR>
hypersensitivity, behavioural abnormalities and reduced nerve function.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'It has also been shown to suppress the immune system, which causes
<BR>
slower response to infections.'
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From _A growing problem: pesticides and the Third
</EM><BR>
World poor_ by David Bull (OXFAM, 1982), p30:
<BR>
<P>'In India malaria incidence was down to just 49,000
<BR>
cases in 1961 (from 75 million or so in the early '50s)
<BR>
but was back to over a million by 1971 and nearly 6.5
<BR>
million by 1976...
<BR>
<P>'In the final years of the 1970s there has been
<BR>
some recovery... In India, for example, malaria
<BR>
incidence fell from its 1976 peak to 4.4 million
<BR>
in 1977, 2.84 million in 1978 and 2.7 million in
<BR>
1979...'
<BR>
<P>After listing various inadequacies of health
<BR>
infrastructure which contributed to the resurgence,
<BR>
the author states:
<BR>
<P>'The most significant cause of the resurgence of
<BR>
malaria, however, is the resistance built up by
<BR>
the mosquitoes to the insecticides which have
<BR>
been relied upon for malaria vector control.'
<BR>
<P>The number of pesticide-resistant species of
<BR>
insects and mites known (p31):
<BR>
<P>1967: 119.
<BR>
1975: 139.
<BR>
1980: 171.
<BR>
<P>And consider the first edition of _The Ultimate Resource_
<BR>
itself (Princeton University Press, 1981). The version on
<BR>
the web, I assume, is that of the 1998 revised edition.
<BR>
There is one reference to DDT in the index of the 1981
<BR>
edition, and this is what it leads to:
<BR>
<P>'Because of DDT and other synthetic pesticides,
<BR>
medical technologists thought for a time that
<BR>
population density was no longer necessary to prevent
<BR>
malaria. Malaria was considered beaten. But
<BR>
throughout the world the disease has bounced back...
<BR>
Due to the evolution of pesticide resistant strains
<BR>
of carrier insects and the concomitant daage to the
<BR>
insects' natural predators, pesticides soon lost
<BR>
their effectiveness...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Once again the only sure weapon against malaria
<BR>
may turn out to be increased population density.'
<BR>
(p252-253, Chapter 18, 'Population Density Does Not
<BR>
Damage Health, or Psychological and Social Well-Being')
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Apparently population growth helps the fight
<BR>
against malaria because (i) swamps and other mosquito
<BR>
incubators get paved over, (ii) there are more people
<BR>
to run the health infrastructure.]
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is Rachel Carson still alive? Let's have her tried at Nuremburg and hung.
</EM><BR>
<P>and thereby fell for *someone's* spin-doctoring.
<BR>
Whoever supplied Julian Simon with his facts surely
<BR>
knew what they were doing.
