Does anybody remember an episode of LA Law where a young woman is dying of a
<BR>
brain disease that will destroy her personality before she will die and can
<BR>
be frozen. She hires the team to challenge the law preventing her from
<BR>
&quot;committing suicide&quot; with assistance so she can be frozen with her
<BR>
personality intact. It was presented very favorably to cryonics, and she won
<BR>
her case!
<BR>
I wonder if the law in Oregon allowing doctor-assisted suicide could be used
<BR>
by someone in this woman's situation?
<BR>
<P>However, the *main* point to my &quot;freeze young&quot; proposal was in the context
<BR>
where &quot;young&quot; means mentally &quot;adept&quot;or &quot;flexible&quot;. It is an open question
<BR>
regarding the degree to which the brain &quot;solidifies&quot; as one accumulates
<BR>
experiences,but it is clear that diseases like Alzheimer's, if allowed to
<BR>
progress, give you a *clearly* different brain than the one you might like
<BR>
to be able to recover.
