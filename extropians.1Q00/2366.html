<P>It *does* escape earth gravity.  But not the star.  The stuff
<BR>
counter-orbits in the same plane as the earthlike planet [ELP] but
<BR>
opposite direction.  And the tube isnt polar, it is equatorial.
<BR>
<P>Since Jeff Davis suggested an engineering flight of fancy [and
<BR>
Jeff is one to think big] I did some single digit precision calcs
<BR>
today using only memory and reasonable approximations,
<BR>
to estimate the needs of his idea for cooling a planet.  I used
<BR>
earthlike numbers instead of Jupiter, because I know the
<BR>
necessary parameters without having to look them up.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>One needs a mass driver capable of launching material parallel
<BR>
to the surface at a velocity of 60 km per second.
<BR>
<P>With just that, one would need only about a quarter of one
<BR>
percent of the mass of the ELP to adjust the axis of rotation
<BR>
so that the axis is parallel to the axis of orbit.  Then another
<BR>
fraction of a percent would be needed to round the orbit, to
<BR>
say 1.5E8 km.  Then I calculated it would take less than one
<BR>
percent of the mass of the ELP to stop its rotation, or rather
<BR>
slow it to one revolution per year, so that the tunnel always
<BR>
faces the orbit direction.  This would result in a tunnel thru
<BR>
the equator about 600 km diameter.  So assume away the
<BR>
atmophere and oceans and imagine an ELP made of solid
<BR>
material of arbitrary rigidity.  The 600 km dia tunnel takes
<BR>
out part of Guyianna, Venezuela and Brazil, going all the way
<BR>
thru to pop out in Indonesia.  Half the stuff that came out that
<BR>
tunnel goes into counter-orbit, carrying away heat, as follows:
<BR>
<P>Half the mass would be launched the opposite direction
<BR>
that the ELP was travelling around the sunlike star [SLS]
<BR>
and the other half would be launched in the orbit direction
<BR>
so that the forward launched matter would have escape
<BR>
velocity from the SLS and would never be seen again,
<BR>
whereas the matter launched the other way would form
<BR>
a counterrotating ring, diameter equal to the orbit diameter
<BR>
of the ELP, which would pass thru the tunnel in the ELP.
<BR>
<P>This is an engineering task that Ray Charles would agree
<BR>
is difficult even if you *know* how to do it.  spike
