This article is particularly ominous, since it seems to clearly link negative 
<BR>
public perceptions of medical biotech with the &quot;frankenfoods&quot; issues.  Also, 
<BR>
note that a substantial majority of Candadians polled indicated that they 
<BR>
would NOT want to prolong their lives by 100 years if they could do so.

<P>Biotech advances spook Canadians: poll
<BR>
<P>GM foods top list of technology fears
<BR>
Mark Kennedy
<BR>
The Ottawa Citizen
<BR>
<P>Canadians fear the brave new world of science that has spawned genetically
<BR>
modified food and could soon lead to lab-grown organs for transplant,
<BR>
according to a new poll conducted for the Citizen.
<BR>
<P>The distrust of what medical technology can offer is so deep that even the
<BR>
prospect of prolonging life by an extra 100 years has people wary.
<BR>
Sixty-eight per cent of those surveyed said that, if it were medically
<BR>
possible, they would opt not to live another 100 years.
<BR>
<P>The survey by Toronto-based Pollara suggests that governments, scientists
<BR>
and health care researchers have a huge sales job to make before
<BR>
technological advances can be put into action.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There's a sense that there are no limits to science in this area and while
<BR>
anything is possible, not everything should be,&quot; said Pollara vice-president
<BR>
Don Guy.
<BR>
<P>The nationwide poll found that Canadians are particularly wary of
<BR>
genetically modified food. Three-quarters of those surveyed think that it
<BR>
will be commonplace within the next decade for stores to be selling
<BR>
genetically engineered groceries.
<BR>
<P>But 62 per cent oppose this happening, a clear indication of public anxiety
<BR>
about an issue that has become a hot political issue in the past few months.
<BR>
<P>Public interest groups have urged the federal government to conduct more
<BR>
research into genetically modified foods instead of relying on data supplied
<BR>
by the industry. As well, they have said the government should introduce a
<BR>
system of mandatory labelling that informs consumers which products are
<BR>
genetically modified.
<BR>
<P>Last fall, 200 scientists from Health Canada's Health Protection Branch
<BR>
signed a petition that, among other things, raised alarm at the acute
<BR>
shortage of scientists for evaluations and risk assessments of genetically
<BR>
modified foods.
<BR>
<P>In December, the federal government moved to soothe public fears by creating
<BR>
an independent panel of experts to provide advice on whether to change the
<BR>
regulatory system for approving genetically engineered products. Critics
<BR>
still weren't satisfied.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Guy, of Pollara, said the problem is that Canadians simply don't trust
<BR>
the assurances from some scientists that genetically modified foods are
<BR>
safe. &quot;The big thing among people is, 'We don't understand it and we can't
<BR>
control it. So why would we proceed with something like this? If I can't see
<BR>
it and touch it and understand it, then how can I make decisions?' &quot;
<BR>
<P>Pollara researchers interviewed 1,017 Canadians over three days in late
<BR>
December. In theory, results of the poll would not differ by more than 3.1
<BR>
percentage points from those that would be obtained by interviewing all
<BR>
Canadian adults in 19 cases out of 20.
<BR>
<P>Among Pollara's other findings:
<BR>
<P>Human cloning: Canadians are almost overwhelmingly opposed to the notion of
<BR>
allowing humans to be cloned. Two-thirds expect it will be possible to clone
<BR>
people within the next decade. But 88 per cent are opposed.
<BR>
<P>The notion of cloning humans -- once confined to science fiction novels and
<BR>
Hollywood movies --is no longer an academic question. Animals have been
<BR>
cloned and experts say it is only a matter of time before researchers do the
<BR>
same with humans.
<BR>
<P>For several years, the federal government has been drafting legislation that
<BR>
would outlaw human cloning and set limits for other reproductive
<BR>
technologies and genetic practices. But the bill, despite repeated promises
<BR>
from Health Minister Allan Rock, has not yet been tabled.
<BR>
<P>Replacement body parts: Unlike human cloning, Canadians seem to have fewer
<BR>
ethical qualms about the emerging field of research on breeding body parts.
<BR>
Still, the public is evenly split on the issue -- a fact that should concern
<BR>
biotechnologists who might assume that patients would naturally support
<BR>
their work.
<BR>
<P>They are involved in one of the most promising areas of bioengineering that
<BR>
could conceivably save the lives of thousands of people awaiting organ
<BR>
transplants. In labs throughout Canada and the U.S., researchers are making
<BR>
great strides in their attempts to produce unlimited quantities of skin, eye
<BR>
corneas, bone and human organs for grafting and transplantation.
<BR>
<P>Pollara found three-quarters of Canadians expect there will be a &quot;market&quot;
<BR>
for body parts in the next decade. But there is a clear split on whether it
<BR>
should happen -- 48 per cent in support, and 48 per cent opposed.
<BR>
<P>Curing disease: Canadians are very optimistic that there will be cures
<BR>
within the next decade for some of the most deadly diseases that have
<BR>
plagued science. Seventy-four per cent think AIDS will be cured by 2010, and
<BR>
73 per cent expect a cure for cancer by that year. On a less positive note,
<BR>
55 per cent also expect an epidemic worse than AIDS will arise in the next
<BR>
decade.
