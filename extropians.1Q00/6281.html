'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am really enjoying this exchange with you.  However it is really starting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take up way too much of my time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hah.  I knew you'd cave eventually.  ;)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you're interested in a &quot;formal&quot; debate on these terms let me know.  If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you would like to change any of the proposed ground rules I'm open to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;shrug&gt; The structure of Internet quotation, I find, makes debate look
<BR>
much like the &quot;formal&quot; debate w/out numbering your points.  One usually
<BR>
responds paragraph by paragraph or section by section, but rather it is
<BR>
the rebuttal post, not the affirmative argument, which decides where those
<BR>
sections are delineated.  I don't take this to be an important difference,
<BR>
however.
<BR>
<P>So, as far as I can tell, this proposal looks just like the debate we've
<BR>
been having, only we number our paragraphs.  I have no strong feelings
<BR>
about the merits of this, though I must admit that it seems like it might
<BR>
be a waste of time.  It'll only cut down on the &quot;I answered this in my
<BR>
last post&quot; bits, which probably won't help you save very much in the long 
<BR>
run.
<BR>
<P>Rather, the best way to make this debate (or any other) take up less of
<BR>
your life is to reply less often.  You'll notice I didn't reply at all
<BR>
today, since I've got an exam I need to study for tomorrow.  I probably
<BR>
won't have any kind of a substantial response until the weekend.  Just
<BR>
waiting a day or two before responding can do wonders for one's schedule,
<BR>
and is more likely to have a positive effect than &quot;formalizing&quot; the
<BR>
debate.
