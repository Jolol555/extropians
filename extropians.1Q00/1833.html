<EM>&gt; &gt; I've just been reading &quot;After Thought&quot;. The premise of this book is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mathematics has passed through 2 major stages up to today; Geometry,
</EM><BR>
then
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Algebraic/formulaic. He proposes that we are, after four hundred years
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the dominance of Cartesian, linear thought, about to move into the third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; great epoch of Mathematics; that of concurrent, computationally
</EM><BR>
intensive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; methods. This includes such techniques as Neural Networks, Cellular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Automata, Genetic Algorithms, and other such wonderful voodoo.

<EM>&gt; This is an interesting supposition, but I don't buy it. Now, most of my
</EM><BR>
friends
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are either mathematicians, or computer scientists (I'm in the latter
</EM><BR>
camp), and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from the discussions we've had it looks like the place that Mathematics is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; headed are the fields of descriptive frameworks. Such things as rings,
</EM><BR>
groups,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lattices and other mathematical structures are a step in this direction.
</EM><BR>
As are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; function valued functions (functors? functionals? I forget what they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called.) Now, this is not divorced from computer science, as such things
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; type theory and category theory have direct application to the designs of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs. The items you list, such as Neural Networks and Genetic
</EM><BR>
Algorithms
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are currently mathematically intractable, and most mathematicians I've
</EM><BR>
talked
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to don't have much to good to say about them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interestingly, your last sentence sounds like what the geometers had to say,
<BR>
but they were talking about ars rei, the &quot;art of the thing&quot;, more recently
<BR>
known as algebra.

&quot;The mind of man doth wonderfully endeavor... that it may light upon
<BR>
something fixt and immoveable... which may, in some measure, moderate the
<BR>
fluctuations and wheelings of the understanding; fearing, it may be, the
<BR>
falling of their heaven.&quot;
