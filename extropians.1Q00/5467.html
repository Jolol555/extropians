</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The fact is that the Mexican government IS a very corrupt government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from top to bottom. Most governments have a for the most part honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; organization of public servants, where only the elected officials are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corrupt, and even then, typically those elected officials are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to be corrupted by those interests they already support. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mexican government is corrupt through its entire structure. Nobody who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lives in Mexico can deny this, because they likely have gotten the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shakedown for money from police, from government officials whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; permits are needed, etc. The fact that the Mexican oil industry is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only oil producing nation that LOSES money on its oil operations ought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to tell you something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes it is true, and I've never denied it, and that's why I am pro oil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privatization, however the government has done a great job in making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us think, that if we make our oil industry private we'll loose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sovereignty and our economy will nosedive into poverty and misery.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is odd. All they have to do to privatize it is issue stock to each and
<BR>
every citizen. If the oil industry causes the country to go to hell after that,
<BR>
its their own fault.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Concerning corrupt police, it is precisely one of the aspects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; annoys me the most, the past week I was a victim of police and I had to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up 2 valuable possessions for me to be released. That's why although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been silent in the gun debates, I think if guns were legalized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here in Mexico, police wouldn't abuse us as much as they do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I got the old shakedown once when I and some buddies in my Air Force unit went
<BR>
down to TJ for some R&amp;R when we deployed to Miramar for some cross service
<BR>
exercises. Fortunately it only cost each of us $25.00.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; About foreign aid, it is our corrupt government who accepts it because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we really shouldn't depend on foreign capital, we have the resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infrastructure and population to be autosuficient, however the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nation's riches are stolen by those in power and they have to ask for foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aid to compensate, sometimes the foreign aid comes directly from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; u.s. To their pockets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The moment we are able to get rid of all the scum that keeps deciding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's best for us in a big brother approach, and brainwashing us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against libertarianism, wiser economic policies or privatization, we'll be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to grow (hell we even do with all this)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Imperialism involves using force to get done what you want done, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; locking other industrial powers out of the resources in the nations you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have power over. Offering a country aid money in return for help in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fulfilling our own foreign policy needs is not imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, but if the U.S. Government knows the foreign aids they send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefits more corrupt politicians than us, and it just makes our dependence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater why do they continue sending it? It appears to me they indirectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support our corrupt government, why has never the U.S. Complained about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tyranny we face and how they should help us in our advance to democracy.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I was writing my previous post, I was thinking the exact same thing, the
<BR>
fact they so eagerly accept our aid (and don't follow through on their
<BR>
agreements on drug enforcement) ought to indicate how eagerly they accept money
<BR>
from other sources that are at counter purposes to us (i.e. the drug
<BR>
traffickers).
