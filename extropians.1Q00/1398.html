Greetings.

<P>It appears as if Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net?Subject=Re:%20POLITICS:%20Re:%20Patents&In-Reply-To=&lt;200001241411.PAA26402@color.sics.se&gt;">lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net</A>&gt; wrote:

<P>First, I wish to quote the Anders Sandberg entity:

&quot;We&quot; is often used for manipulation, since it implies that the

speaker/writer and the listener/reader belong to the same group. This

activates subconscious feelings of kinship, clan loyalty and &quot;us against

them&quot;-mentality which can be exploited.  Be very careful when dealing with

anybody insisting on talking about &quot;us&quot; when he want you to do something!

<P>That written... stop reading the following text if you dislike entering

&lt;AGITATED MODE&gt;
<BR>
<P>|We generally reject subsidies on principle, but not patents.  What's
<BR>
|the difference?  People argue for subsidies because we think the
<BR>
|subsidized activity is a valuable one: the French want good wine, so
<BR>
|they subsidize vineyards.  We want heartland corn farmers to stay in
<BR>
|business regardless of demand, so we subsidize them.  We want Detroit
<BR>
|auto workers to have jobs, so we levy high import taxes on Japanese
<BR>
|cars.
<BR>
<P>Patents, copyright and subsidies all work somewhat differently, but the
<BR>
effects of them do not. Patents and copyright appeared late (like only two
<BR>
centuries ago).  Human feel patents and copyright are righteous simply due
<BR>
to the fact that humans have short memories.
<BR>
<P>Subsidies simply mean that some power brokers declare their own hidden
<BR>
agenda as so much more important than those of all the people trading
<BR>
the products/services/whatever that their own hidden agenda can and should
<BR>
override those others' needs or wishes.
<BR>
<P>They nullify the effects of the natural selection mechanism used by humans
<BR>
in a market economy.
<BR>
<P>The power brokers can be government, the mob, or some other power junkie type.
<BR>
<P>a. &quot;the French want good wine, so they subsidize vineyards&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the French want good wine, they will buy the good stuff.  If the French
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vineyards deliver good grapes, they wine makers make a good wine, and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public relations departments of their wine firms inform the market of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good stuff, they will sell their good stuff.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need no subsidies if they make good stuff.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't make good stuff, they _definitely_ shouldn't have subsidies.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden agenda: nationalism.  French government define French wines
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as better since they are French.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodness of the wine is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>b. &quot;We want heartland corn farmers to stay in business regardless of demand,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we subsidize them.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden agenda: nationalism. The U.S. government define the heartlanders'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corn as better since they are made in U.S.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the corn is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>c. &quot;We want Detroit auto workers to have jobs, so we levy high import taxes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Japanese cars.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden agenda: nationalism and parlamentarism.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Detroit auto workers lose market
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;share, the party can lose voters and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;party people lose their power.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the cars is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>+      We want there to be lots of inventions and new research, so we
<BR>
|indirectly subsidize them by granting protected markets.  But are
<BR>
|the benefits those programs unarguably give to corn farmers, auto
<BR>
|workers, and patentholders worth the long-terms costs?  I'd like to
<BR>
|see this question addressed from something other than a knee-jerk
<BR>
|&quot;inventions good--give money&quot; attitude.  I'd like to see addressed
<BR>
|the real cost of creating a culture that just assumes information
<BR>
|should _not_ be shared freely.
<BR>
<P>In a historical perspective, mathematicians did exactly that in them thar
<BR>
olden days.  Knowledge on how to solver various mathematical problems were
<BR>
well preserved trade secrets.  As you might expect, development of the field
<BR>
crawled to a practical stand-still.
<BR>
<P>For those enjoying a static world where nothing really changes and where those
<BR>
in the know can live like kings on being the guardians of the secret knowledge,
<BR>
patents and copyright would have been a god-send. Luckily for the development
<BR>
of science and technology in the Western culture, they didn't have them.
<BR>
<P>If one really cares about invention, research, etc., then one should examine
<BR>
those hidden agendas above and see how to remove them, so the price of products
<BR>
and services follow what people want to pay for them.  No more and no less.
<BR>
<P>Open the borders for free movement of people, products, and services.
<BR>
Remove all subsidies to pet groups by people in power as corruption.
<BR>
Stop patents and copyrights being used to stop inventions and information.
<BR>
<P>If people in some area really prefer their own products for some reason
<BR>
(e.g. feelings of superiority, or random political or theological beliefs)
<BR>
let them do so.  Those who prefer the best quality will buy that quality
<BR>
if the price is right, and so on.
<BR>
<P>Summary: Let the global market decide.
<BR>
<P>&lt;/AGITATED MODE&gt;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- = - = - = -
<BR>
<P>FAQ anyone?
<BR>
--------------
<BR>
<P>Say, has nobody really
<BR>
&nbsp;(i) read through the Extropian Archives which, according to rumours, really
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exist Out There(tm) somewhere,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;and
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(ii) made an FAQ over standard, recurring issues (such as the one above)?
<BR>
<P>Now, wouldn't such an FAQ be a rather good idea to create?
<BR>
<P>I would have made an FAQ myself, but, alas, the Extropian Archives appear to
<BR>
not work, either because
<BR>
<P>(a) they simply refuse access from those network places I've tried to access
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them for some reason hidden in the shrouds of History,
<BR>
<P>or because
<BR>
<P>(b) they have been stored in the moldy chambers of the great Grand-Wizards
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of extropianism and thus no longer may be accessed by mere mortals.
<BR>

No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it
<BR>
all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly
<BR>
the functions he is competent to.  It is by dividing and subdividing these
<BR>
republics from the national one down through all its subordinations, until it
<BR>
ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself; by placing under
<BR>
every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the
<BR>
best.
