<EM>&gt; &gt;How would economic equality be brought about and maintained?  (I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;advocating this -- only trying to see how Zero will answer this.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure why you're asking this question or what it has to do with
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thread.  But since you asked, here goes:  First off, I never called for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate &quot;economic equality.&quot;  But if you want my guess as to how it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually come about, I think that once we all have access to
</EM><BR>
nano-enabled
<BR>
<EM>&gt; near-anything boxes, you will ipso facto have substantial &quot;economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equality&quot; since anybody will be able to make near-anything at almost no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then we don't need that equality to be enforced by law?  Nanotech will only
<BR>
bring about equality of certain stuff.  Information will still not be equal.
<BR>
It mgiht be easier to get and use, but even a slight advantage in it will
<BR>
result in one person having better stuff than another.  I'm willing to
<BR>
living with that, provided the other person is not out to kill or control
<BR>
me.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I have problems with ubiquitous surveillance too.  Transparency might
</EM><BR>
look
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like a solution to all sorts of problems, but...  I do think that in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;short run, any moves in that direction, will only benefit the elites and
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the long run, if it doesn't, it will make the majority nearly omnipotent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Inescapable majority rule is not my idea of social paradise.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;what Bruce Sterling would call an &quot;enforcement technology.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well that, of course, is the call to arms to make sure that the &quot;elites&quot;
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not the sole (or even primary) beneficiaries of transparency.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow how you equate transparency with an &quot;omnipotent&quot; majority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regardless of the existence of transparency freedom will always depend
</EM><BR>
upon
<BR>
<EM>&gt; an open society with sufficient checks and balances to insure that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person or group does not have the ability to take control to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disadvantage of another individual or group.  The way I see it
</EM><BR>
transparency
<BR>
<EM>&gt; helps to further this goal, not to inhibit it, particularly where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency if two-way and power equivolent.
</EM><BR>
<P>And I do not.  Imagine this.  You live in a society where most people find
<BR>
gays repulsive and quite a few are willing to kill gays.  The majority,
<BR>
let's say, doesn't care about gays dying per se, especially if they see
<BR>
certain gays having lots of mind blowing anal sex many times a week or
<BR>
night.  Let's say you are one of those gays and your neighbor is one of
<BR>
those people who hates gays and is willing to kick your ass when he sees you
<BR>
coming from some sexual encounter.  For some reason or other, let's also
<BR>
suppose he is bigger than you and has more computer power, etc.  You are too
<BR>
busy having a good time to notice him -- among the myriad of other data your
<BR>
surveillance provides you with.  Everyone sees him kicking your ass, but
<BR>
most people tune to another channel.  Some people even watch with glee.  He
<BR>
kills you.  Some people, defending him, might point to his bad childhood
<BR>
experiences with gays and so on -- all of this is in some database too.
<BR>
Those who should be against him -- the Law -- only make a halfhearted
<BR>
defense, because, hey, almost everyone knows gays are disgusting and evil
<BR>
and you are only just another dead fag.  How has ubiquitous surveillance
<BR>
benefited you?
<BR>
<P>More likely, what would happen, is you would be just like a gay man in the
<BR>
1950s -- in the closet very deep.  That is a nearly omnipotent majority in
<BR>
action.  Just the notion that others are watching prevents you from doing
<BR>
things which harm no one, but might lead to social ostracism or even violent
<BR>
reprisals.  It's nice to think a future society with ubiquitous surveillance
<BR>
would not have all these flaws, BUT how can Zero guarantee that -- or even
<BR>
present what will most likely happen?  If human history is any guide, the
<BR>
more people are watched, the less freedom they have.  In puritan New
<BR>
England, e.g., people who lived alone were often thought to be witches
<BR>
because monitoring each other's behavior was the thing to do.  In modern
<BR>
dictatorships, as others and myself have pointed out, surveillance often
<BR>
goes overboard.  (Argentina under the Junta in the 1970s and 1980s (by no
<BR>
means the most repressive government of that time) had people -- actual
<BR>
people -- listen in on overseas phone calls.  All such phone conversations
<BR>
has to be conducted in Spanish so that the monitors could understand what
<BR>
was being said.  They would even cut in when they couldn't understand.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I think what we might say is Zero supports many planks which would lead
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;totalitarian society -- rather than that it/she/he is a totalitarian per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;se.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This, sadly, is what too many people support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the usual knee-jerk reaction.  But if you stop and think about it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power equivolent ubiquitous transparency can not possibly lead to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totalitarian society.  To the contrary it will help to assure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totalitarianism is never able to take hold.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did think about it.  As I've said elsewhere, I trust some of my immediate
<BR>
reactions.  Pulling my hand away from flames is a good thing.  After
<BR>
thinking more about this issue, I'm even more confirmed in my above
<BR>
reaction.
<BR>
<P>Of course, if Zero can prove me wrong, that would be great.  (Not that I
<BR>
want to spend all of my waking hours arguing about this.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
