<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000329205813.84260.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proportional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nonetheless, the secrecy of our top levels of organization is certainly as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it should be, as it's hard to imagine these organizaitons doing their jobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effectively without this sort of secrecy.  This may not have been the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point to which you were replying, but it's right anyway.  ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well yes.  As long as we have baggage we must carry such as national 
<BR>
sovereignty.  But one day, we will lay that baggage down.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If the top levels of government are under extreme scrutiny, yet to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scrutinize someone about X, you have to reveal X to the scrutinized, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is it NOT the case that both the top levels of government and the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guy are under extreme scrutiny?  Whoever is fully scrutinizing Clinton is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully scrutinized by Clinton.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well since the technology is not yet operational, its a bit difficult for me 
<BR>
to imagine *exactly* how it will work.  But generally, this is what I have 
<BR>
in mind.  If you want to be a powerful mucky-muck who can effect the lives 
<BR>
of a great many people it is open season on you.  Meaning that (much like 
<BR>
Pres. Clinton has gone through) we will release the hounds of the press on 
<BR>
you to dig up anything and everything that they can about you and, unlike 
<BR>
Joe Q. Public, you will little if any right of privacy or recourse against 
<BR>
the press unless you can show that they intentionally lied about you.  This 
<BR>
is pretty much the state of the law now.
<BR>
<P>Now, all this information will be published about you (much as it is today) 
<BR>
and will become part of the public record which anyone will be able to 
<BR>
access without having to give up any tidbits about themselves.  This will 
<BR>
contain such boring trivia as your professional curriculum vitae, job 
<BR>
performance ratings, the identity of your friends, acquaintences and lovers, 
<BR>
your medical records, credit history, etc.  Basically any data that will 
<BR>
give the voting public an idea of what kind of person they are getting when 
<BR>
they vote for you.  But even the mightiest and most powerful might have 
<BR>
*some* data that keeps itself out of the public record.  To access *that* 
<BR>
data you would have to give up the same about yourself.
<BR>
<P>This way the microscope on the President is bigger than the one on me 
<BR>
biggest I start out with a great deal of &quot;free&quot; information, an advantage he 
<BR>
does not have.  Moreoever, there will be many, many more people interested 
<BR>
in poking around the president's records than would be interested in seeing 
<BR>
mine.  So yes if I was curious, say, to know if Clinton's penis really had 
<BR>
that anomoly that was bandied about in the press, I might have to give him a 
<BR>
picture of mine.  But in that case he would be flooded with so many penis 
<BR>
pictures from all over the world, I would have little need to fear that he 
<BR>
would fixate on mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It seems that even if your system works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flawlessly, the result is simple total surveilance a la Brin, where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras are everywhere and anyone who wants to can look at any camera at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any time to find out what you're up to right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, that's pretty much the idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How could you guarantee that whatever I learn about you, you learn about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me?  If the information is already organized into facts (telephone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;numbers, addresses, etc.) it's easy to see, but when the question is of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the form &quot;are they having sex right now?&quot; it's hard to imagine how a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simple system could reveal that to you and reveal that to the targetted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;party in any useful way, or even answer the question without at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human level intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem gets compounded when I start asking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;with whom are they having sex right now?  How?  Are they doing so in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approved way?&quot;  In general, the whole point of surveilance is to detect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrongdoing.  I want to ask &quot;are they commiting a wrongdoing?&quot;  How would a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simple system know that?  How could a simple system reveal that to others?
</EM><BR>
<P>I never said it would be a &quot;simple system.&quot;  It will likely take the help of 
<BR>
strong AI and nanotech.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Finally, what's stopping the government from using the cameras all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time, with your full knowledge?  Sure, you'd get lots of information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the despot at the head of government, but, it doesn't *matter* how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information you get about the despot; indeed, more information only makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the despot's threats more plausible.  You both know he's a despot making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unreasonable demands and that he could squash you like a bug if he felt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like it.  How has transparency helped you?
</EM><BR>
<P>The government *would* be using the cameras all the time.  So will any other 
<BR>
nosy busy body who chooses to do so.  So what?  You will know when you are 
<BR>
being watched.  If you are a law-abiding citizen why on Earth would you 
<BR>
care?  If you are a criminal, knowing that you are being watched by the 
<BR>
government (and that nosy Mrs. Kravitz down the street) would encourage you 
<BR>
to explore other possibile occupations.
<BR>
<P>In a truly transparent society there would be no &quot;despots&quot; unless we the 
<BR>
people collectively decided to turn our fates over to a despot.  I don't 
<BR>
know about you, but I ain't voting for any despots anytime soon.
<BR>
