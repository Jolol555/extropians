<EM>&gt;Since there are more people in the US than guns, then it is hardly a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of fact. Since there are more people in the world than guns in the world, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also not a statement of fact. A statement of fact would be,&quot;an organization 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fights to maintain every law abiding American's right to own as many or as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guns as they wish.&quot; That would be a statement of fact as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-inflammatory.
</EM><BR>
<P>I recall reading something that said there are more guns in the US than 
<BR>
people.  That was why I made the statement.  However, if I am wrong about 
<BR>
that, I am not ashamed to admit it.  Do you know where the number of guns in 
<BR>
circulation can be found?
