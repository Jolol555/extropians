&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I indulged in some name-calling, true; but when the swastika 
<BR>
fits, wear it proudly, retros!  Hunh?  Ya don't like being called 
<BR>
fascists?  Well, whether or not you like the fact, it is the white dog 
<BR>
truth that not only do the far-right owe most of their historical 
<BR>
origins to the Fascists and the Nazis, but also, the members of 
<BR>
that retro movement include a disproportionate percentage of 
<BR>
racist, sexist, fundamentalist and antisemitic luddite thugs.  Of 
<BR>
course, they'll attempt to brand their opposition with the fascist 
<BR>
label which gun gonads rightfully have historically owned lock, 
<BR>
stock and smoking barrel, just as they'll call their opposition 
<BR>
zombies when it is they who are lock-goose-stepping to the martial 
<BR>
music; they know a good albatross when they have had to wear it 
<BR>
around their own necks.  Speaking of necks, I suspect that a lot of 
<BR>
the cold dead fingers cabal piping up onlist are pencil-necked 
<BR>
geeks who feel fearful in the local Dairy Queen unless they are 
<BR>
packing their penile prostheses.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the salient point of requiring gun registration as we must 
<BR>
do for automobiles, it is nothing short of irresponsible to fight same, 
<BR>
and to allow, by default, criminal types to purchase firearms at 
<BR>
open death-market gun shows, and nothing short of criminal 
<BR>
negligence to fight safe smartgun technology.  I suspect that the 
<BR>
defenders of such sociopathically insane policies truly treasure 
<BR>
their opportunities to rub shoulders with the true bad-boy outlaws 
<BR>
who have been replenishing their arsenals at these events.  There 
<BR>
should be a purchase-prohibited registry, at the very least, that 
<BR>
forbids the purchase of firearms to those listed within it, and people 
<BR>
convicted of violent crimes, those with restraining orders/peace 
<BR>
bonds issued against them, and the duly certified mentally 
<BR>
incompetent and/or deranged should have their names included as 
<BR>
part and parcel of the actions taken regarding them.  Any TRULY 
<BR>
responsible gun owners (and I own five) would not want such 
<BR>
people armed around them.  I suspect that a large part of the 
<BR>
stridency exhibited in opposition to these sane, logical, rational, 
<BR>
reasonable regulations is due to the probability that many of their 
<BR>
opponents (including some on this list) would then not be eligible to 
<BR>
pack, due to their criminal histories, records of violent intimidation 
<BR>
and physical/sexual abuse, mental incompetence and/or emotional 
<BR>
instability.
