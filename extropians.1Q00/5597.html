<P><EM>&gt; Hello friends, this is a quick query for some of the most imaginative and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tech savvy people I know. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *What bold endeavors do you wish you could see funded in the next decade? 
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a *large* list of things that I would like to see started in the 
<BR>
next decade. A quick list of the ones on top of my head at the moment are:
<BR>
<P><P>1) Rebuild the entire World-Wide-Web so that it was more usefull to more 
<BR>
people in more ways. What we have now is a pale imitation of what we could 
<BR>
achieve. It should (without requiring extra work from the web designer) be 
<BR>
able to support a huge range of disabled people, both physically and 
<BR>
cognitively. It should be able to categorize and present information based 
<BR>
on your interests, what you are currently focussed on seeing, what would 
<BR>
be economically beneficial for you to see, and that you've asked about. It 
<BR>
should be able to represent the same data in a hundred different ways, and 
<BR>
combine it with data from a myriad of sources. It should be as machine-
<BR>
readable as it is human readable, and it should be infinitely adaptable to 
<BR>
new technologies and modalities of thinking. And it should be answerable 
<BR>
to the user at every level of presentation. (Some friends and I actually 
<BR>
have a plan for implementing just such an update. If we could come up with 
<BR>
50 million or so, we could start right away.)
<BR>
<P>2) Invest in the people of undeveloped countries. Human beings are the 
<BR>
most precious untapped resource on the planet, and there are easily a 
<BR>
dozen business models that show how much money you could make by providing 
<BR>
education, housing and a start in business to the impoverished in the 
<BR>
third world, in exchange for a piece of the action. The main problem is 
<BR>
that you have to be willing to plan to start making a major profit in only 
<BR>
20 or 30 years, and you have to take the whims of foreign governments into 
<BR>
account. Depending on which models you choose, you can start small (the 
<BR>
Grameen (sp?) bank started with US$100.00) or with a big investment (50 
<BR>
billion to go whole hog, I figure).
<BR>
<P>3) Fund a project to take NASA's plans for a self-replicating lunar 
<BR>
factory and make it a reality. This has an up-front cost in the hundreds 
<BR>
of billions, but has an exponential pay-off.
<BR>
<P>4) Start a Singularity Institute who's main objectives would be to fund 
<BR>
exploration into the many fields that could lead to trancendence. This 
<BR>
would include Neurology, Nanotech, Sentient Systems, Complexity, Genetics, 
<BR>
Advanced Materials, and others. It would also have a large PR and 
<BR>
strategic planning wing to figure out how to present new technologies in a 
<BR>
non-threatening manner.
<BR>
<P>5) Start a chain of 'real food' restaurants. Nothing but real butter, 
<BR>
whole grain breads and pastas, grain-fed free range beef and chicken, all 
<BR>
with as little chemical forcing as possible. Let people discover what food 
<BR>
used to taste like.
<BR>
<P><P><PRE>
