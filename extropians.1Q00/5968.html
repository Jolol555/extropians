<EM>&gt; &gt;You have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of &quot;efficient&quot; (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot; for that matter).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That you will &quot;never be convinced&quot; suggests a position that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rational in its basis.  In fact, dumping *is* more efficient and to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;benefit of *everyone* in the long-term than doing as you suggest.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hardly call forcing a farmer to sell their grain at or below cost to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot;; it sounds like theft to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would say that *you* have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;theft.&quot;  I'm no farmer, but I'm sure that as between selling my grain at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost and just dumping it for nothing, I'd much rather do the former.  Sure, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would *rather* sell it at a profit, but I would *not* consider someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offering to pay cost for something that I otherwise plan to just destroy, to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a thief.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If farmers wanted to sell their product at or below cost, they would
<BR>
already be doing it.  Since the only way this will happen is through force,
<BR>
it can be called theft. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;At cost&quot; is a strawman.  The market would handle the situation just
<BR>
fine if it was merely &quot;at cost&quot;.  Margins are generally quite thin so
<BR>
it isn't a case of price gouging.  Most of the countries receiving grain
<BR>
get it free or substantially below cost.  If they could afford to pay at
<BR>
cost it would be largely a non-issue, since it would allow the producers
<BR>
to stay competitive with people re-selling their product.  
<BR>
<P>Let me explain it again:
<BR>
<P>If producers give away excess capacity below cost, it lowers the average
<BR>
margin on the grain that they do sell for a profit, sometimes forcing
<BR>
them out of the market.  The short-term effect may be beneficial
<BR>
(recovering expenses), but the glut of too cheap grain creates a very
<BR>
negative long-term effect on overall production because it decreases the
<BR>
effective market size from a producers standpoint.  If the world worked
<BR>
your way, the producers would quickly sink into unprofitability and
<BR>
would shut down.
