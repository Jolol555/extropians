Australia has an interesting if sometimes irritating national radio program
<BR>
called The Science Show, run by veteran broadcaster Robyn Williams. Robyn
<BR>
and I go way back, although we rarely cross paths except in the odd public
<BR>
panel he happens to have been flown in to chair. His show blends gung-ho
<BR>
gosh-wow with fearful Green warnings of biodoom. Today was mostly the
<BR>
upside, with a long chat between him and Professor Sir Harold W. Kroto,
<BR>
University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K., who shared a Nobel with Rick Smalley
<BR>
(as he called his fellow laureate) and Professor Robert F. Curl, Jr., like
<BR>
Smalley at Rice University, Houston, USA. This was followed by a positive
<BR>
and entertaining grab from one of the IBM fullerene researchers, a Scot
<BR>
with a Polish name who works in Switzerland (of course). Both these
<BR>
notables were favorable in their discussions of the prospects of molecular
<BR>
nanotech. Kroto told us to go the Web for nice sims of rotating nano
<BR>
gadgetry, and I believe they both cited Feynman. Was Drexler or Foresight
<BR>
Institute mentioned? No. Was Merkle cited? Not on your nellie. Were space
<BR>
elevators mentioned? Yes, as it chanced, although they tended to be called
<BR>
`tethers'; Arthur Clarke was acknowledged for his efforts in promoting the
<BR>
idea. Was Moravec mentioned? You're joking.
<BR>
<P>Ah well. The bottom line is that the experts both spoke contentedly of the
<BR>
prospect of molecular assemblers (going to extreme lengths, it seemed to
<BR>
me, not to use that term - `assembly machines', etc), and despite the
<BR>
mind-boggled faux-amazement of the presenter (I *hope* it was feigned) at
<BR>
the incredibly novel idea of a space elevator - gosh is NASA *really*
<BR>
thinking about such things? - this will help prepare Aussies, at least, for
<BR>
an extrope future...
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, however, the national Murdoch newspaper The Australian outdid
<BR>
itself with a color supplement showing on the cover a patchwork girl and
<BR>
the inevitable brainless heading: FRANKENSCIENCE. In the land of Greg Egan,
<BR>
&nbsp;unknown to most of his fellow citizens, this is vomit-making.
