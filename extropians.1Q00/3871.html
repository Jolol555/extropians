<EM>&gt; mail you a copy if you wish, or better yet, I will scan and email it.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be nice to get it, I'll add it to the database and link it to the
<BR>
Landis paper.  
<BR>
<P>[I wonder how much progress will speed up when engineers can stop

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I did the same thing Landis did: numerical integration.  {8-[
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I used excel for that purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect that if Mathematica can't integrate it then it can't be done.
<BR>
Fortunately, the computers are so fast now, numerical integration does
<BR>
a fine job for most stuff.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly enough, I converted one of Matloff's early papers on Solar
<BR>
sails the a couple of days ago and he mentions doing the calculations
<BR>
on a TI SR-52... remember those???  Things are so much simpler today,
<BR>
but you need a full semester course to really learn to use Excel or
<BR>
Mathematica well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder if anyone has managed to perform that integral and get a closed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form solution for the mass of a skyhook in terms of specific strength of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the material and the mass and rotation rate of the planet about which it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbits.  Have you heard of such a solution?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope.  Send it off to Wolfram as a bug they need to fix. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I did my paper, I mentioned spider silk, but not diamond.  I didnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a theoretical tensile strength of diamond.  Do you have that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Pg. 386 of NM says the Young's Modulus is ~400 GPa for saphire and 1050 GPa
<BR>
for diamond.  But what we really need are some comparisons between the
<BR>
compressive and tensile strength.  Since it isn't in the Structural Materials
<BR>
sheet from my Physical Properties workbook, I doubt I've run across it in
<BR>
any of the books I currently have.  &quot;Honey, can I see your diamond for
<BR>
a minute?&quot;,  &quot;Why?&quot;, &quot;Oh, the school won't give me the funds to do
<BR>
a compression test on one, so I figured I'd use yours....&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Also, I think someone mentioned a isosynchronous cable on Mars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I concluded in 1993 that it is faaar more feasible there than on Earth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Naturally.  Mercury would be even better because the rotational speed
<BR>
is much lower.  I'm wondering though if you or Landis took into account
<BR>
the strength requirements for gale force winds buffeting the tower???
<BR>
With that much surface area you really have to do that.
