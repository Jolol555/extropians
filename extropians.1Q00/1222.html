I originally posted this on Cryonet but felt I should share it here.  Japan 
<BR>
now has a cryonics organization and though in the beginning stages I think 
<BR>
it holds great promise.  I checked out their website and learned a great 
<BR>
deal that I share in this post.  Takaaki Kaburagi is one of the founding 
<BR>
members and a gentleman who would be among peers in the company of the most 
<BR>
accomplished extropians.  Mizuho Hirose is a woman who is a bit of a 
<BR>
mystery.  She seems to have accomplished something very important for the 
<BR>
group and is artistic by nature.  I hope this seed finds fertile ground in 
<BR>
Japan.

<EM>&gt;My question to you is what are you suggesting that doesn't already &gt;exist?
</EM><BR>
<P>A primary goal would appear to be having a cryonics organization that is 
<BR>
based in Japan but networks with people from all over the world.  
<BR>
Considering how Japan is such an advanced and wealthy nation I think an 
<BR>
organization like this is long-overdue.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps they will find more fertile ground in Japan to recruit cryonicists 
<BR>
and raise money.  I could be wrong but it seems like the Japanese mindset 
<BR>
might be much more accepting of cryonics.  What are the opinions on this?  I 
<BR>
hope Japan proves to be the place where the capital can be raised to push 
<BR>
forward research at the rate we need.
<BR>
<P>I was very interested by the Japanese members.  Mizuho Hirose is the founder 
<BR>
and shows a playful and artistic nature though she does not reveal her age 
<BR>
or background.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From her bio:
</EM><BR>
My name is Mizuho Hirose.  Please allow me to make secret of my age and 
<BR>
background.
<BR>
<P>But at least I can tell you that my existence itself has now been
<BR>
greatly appreciated by the Metamorphosis Society.
<BR>
<P>My principle is as follows:
<BR>
<P>&quot;After all, good sake and good songs are the musts for one's life.&quot;
<BR>
If I can &quot;go to the future,&quot; I would like to make other people happy
<BR>
by singing many beautiful songs.  In the future, I wish to have a life like 
<BR>
this... On Monday, I sing chansons at a dance hall to make an energetic 
<BR>
start for the week; On Tuesday, I take many men with me as the vocal of a 
<BR>
radical rock band; On Wednesday, I am an innocent little girl and sing 
<BR>
ancient songs with a small harp; On Thursday, I play piano, probably some 
<BR>
jazz music; On Friday, I sing songs at a Wagner's opera while playing a 
<BR>
daughter of God in a mythical world;
<BR>
On Saturday, I go to a church and offer hymns to God; On Sunday, I enjoy 
<BR>
sake and my favorite songs at home.
<BR>
<P>This is how I wish to live in the future.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Takaaki Kaburagi from a young age had the desire to change the world for the 
<BR>
better through science.  After several starts he decided on information 
<BR>
science as his field to do this.  He helped Kobe quake survivors network 
<BR>
online and has designed software for people to work with their local 
<BR>
government.
<BR>
<P>This fellow has even written operas that went from the ancient past to the 
<BR>
future and actually produced one where he met his wife!  He is a 
<BR>
well-rounded guy but gave up on his opera endeavors when attendance was 
<BR>
poor.
<BR>
<P>I liked his closing words.  &quot;Even after I &quot;go&quot; to the future, I want to 
<BR>
enjoy exquisite tastes of various drinks and food, enjoy life with a 
<BR>
beloved, and enjoy encountering someone and/or something beautiful as many 
<BR>
times as possible, in order to be energetic to work more for future after 
<BR>
future.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I just want to say I wish this organization the best.  Perhaps Paul Wakfer 
<BR>
can see his dreams of reversible cryosuspension realized here?  I hope so.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
