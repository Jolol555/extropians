<EM>&gt; Methinks not, Sir Bradbury.  {8^D

<P>Well, Spike, there are a few people on the list who will from time
<BR>
to time exceed even my rather loose boundaries on diplomacy...
<BR>
But hey, that just makes us a more exciting group... Why drink
<BR>
caffeine when I can read the Extro list...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robert, during that E4 pitch of which I was absorbing practically nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of the fact that I know not diddly about genetic modification,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you protested something the speaker proclaimed.  While I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vividly the event, I dont know enough about [germ line?] theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll summarize.  Gene therapy is about:
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) deciding what gene you want to suppress, enhance or modify;
<BR>
&nbsp;(b) deciding in which organs you want to do that;
<BR>
&nbsp;(c) developing a delivery tool (usually a modified virus) to go
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the specified organs/tissues and/or only express that gene
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in those organs, and have that expression on a long term basis;
<BR>
&nbsp;(d) have the gene expression produce the desired physiological result.
<BR>
&nbsp;(e) not break anything while you are doing this.
<BR>
<P>Greg and John have been informed by some of the leading researchers
<BR>
in gene therapy that this is very hard (it is).  However we have
<BR>
examples, particularly in our immune system, where highly specific
<BR>
genome modifications occur (so it isn't impossible).  The meme
<BR>
Greg and John were trying to &quot;distribute&quot; was &quot;since its hard
<BR>
lets forget about it and do something else&quot; (namely develop a
<BR>
good way to produce editable chromosomes in your bioengineered
<BR>
children).  That is fine and good and reasonable, however it doesn't
<BR>
do diddledy-squat for me and that is what triggered my bluntness
<BR>
alarms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please, could you give us, in ~100 words or less that a rocket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guy could understand, what he said and what you said.  Rather,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you said immediately following &quot;THATS NOT TRUE!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That part I understood.  {8^D  spike
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a rocket scientist point of view, just view it as a highly
</EM><BR>
complex orbital insertion maneuver where you have to anticipate
<BR>
all of the problems up front, make sure you don't come in too
<BR>
high or too low or accidentally do the whole routine around the
<BR>
wrong asteroid.  Complicating the game is the fact that your sensors
<BR>
have about 1/100 of the resolution that you need to accomplish the mission
<BR>
in a reliable fashion.  An *interesting* comparative analysis would
<BR>
be for successful rocket missions and gene therapies to date.  I would
<BR>
guess at this time, that gene therapies are running ahead of rocket
<BR>
missions (at least in terms of not blowing up the launch pad) but
<BR>
probably not by much.
<BR>
<P>If I recall correctly the actual trigger was someone in the audience
<BR>
making a point that their approach didn't do them any good (they
<BR>
understood the implications) and John pretty much agreed with them and
<BR>
moved on to how the future could only be in engineering our children.
<BR>
John's claim that I was objecting to had to do with the probability
<BR>
that we would *never* solve the problems outlined above.
<BR>
<P>They certainly are difficult problems.  But you know me well enough
<BR>
to know the fine line I draw between the difficult and stuff that
<BR>
involves magic physics.  What Greg and John may not be aware of is
<BR>
that the gene therapy trials for cancer probably outnumber by
<BR>
several times those for &quot;genetic defects&quot; (baby in a bubble immune
<BR>
system deficiencies, amino acid metabolism deficiencies, etc).
<BR>
Many many more people die from cancer (due to mutated genes) than
<BR>
are born with lifestyle-impacting defective genomes.  If you kill
<BR>
a patient with cancer in a gene therapy trial its much different
<BR>
from killing a young man with a metabolism deficiency.  The cancer
<BR>
patient is facing a short-term death sentence in most cases.
<BR>
Even a small chance of success with the cancer patient will justify
<BR>
the development of the technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PS regarding bluntness: dont change a thing Robert, we like you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just the way you are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I'm not always blunt.  There is a suave, sophisticated, sincere,
<BR>
sweet side, but its usually reserved for short haired bruenettes
<BR>
of the opposite sex.
<BR>
<P>Robert
