<P><EM>&gt; Now I turn the recent 2001 proposed budget of the U.S. Federal Government.

<EM>&gt; The issue:  it is not who watches the watchmen but who pays them.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; United States is benefitting from unheralded state of productivity growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which rises, explicitly economically, from investment in research and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development, and more vaguely Alan Greenspan, and very minorly, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politician.  I am thinking that most people make more money than me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thus paying more taxes, yet I am still interested in where my 1/3 of total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monetary productivity given to the government does go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's where it should go:  paydown of the national debt.  The younger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation didn't make it and doesn't want it, and the baby boomers will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living long enough that it would be bad for them if Social Security crashed.

<P>Ross, many years ago I was a big anti-debt advocate (for the reasons
<BR>
you outline).  I'm not so sure anymore.  I suspect that I could make
<BR>
a pretty good case that properly directed government spending towards
<BR>
the development of an &quot;almost anything&quot; box will produce so much growth
<BR>
in the near future, that the national debt is irrelevant.  Why do people
<BR>
buy bonds?  To have an income in the future.  Why do they need an income?
<BR>
To meet their material requirements.  Now while Robin might disagree
<BR>
that we don't throw away the economy overnight, I could see a very
<BR>
interesting scenario where the government develops an almost anything
<BR>
box, puts it in the public domain and simultaneously defaults on
<BR>
any remaining national debt.
<BR>
<P>One thing I am pretty sure about is that in a few years, if it
<BR>
becomes clear that biotech is going to significantly extend longevity
<BR>
(e.g. William Haseltine, CEO of Human Genome Sciences, predicting
<BR>
in the Oct 18, 1999 WSJ Health and Medicine section, pg R10, that
<BR>
the life expactancy of people born in 2050 will be 150+ years)
<BR>
then Social Security will be permanently broken and the only way
<BR>
out will be to invest in nanotech lifeboat.
