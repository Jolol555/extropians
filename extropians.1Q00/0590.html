<P>
'What is your name?'  'J. R. Molloy.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't believe it has anything to do with conspiracy. It follows from the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that by definition, the ruling class wants to rule. It can't rule unruly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjects. Hence, it severely punishes instances of unruliness, including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking of drugs.
</EM><BR>
<P>This incorporates a weird assumption, to my mind, that the taking of drugs
<BR>
induces unruliness.  Indeed, it's one of the big arguments of
<BR>
pro-marijuana debaters that marijuana, for example, doesn't make you
<BR>
unruly in the way that, for example, alcohol does.
<BR>
<P>I take you to have laid out a very particular account of why drug use is
<BR>
punished harshly: the ruling class punishes drug use because drug use is
<BR>
threatening to the ruling class.  I take this account to be false, not the
<BR>
least in part because drug use is NOT threatening to the ruling class;
<BR>
quite the reverse, in fact.  If they believe that it does, then we might
<BR>
attribute them with acting foolishly, but that's telling a very different
<BR>
story about what's going on in the halls of government.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess that depends on the particular ruling class in question. If you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; test the theory, try doing drugs in Turkey and see what the Turkish ruling class
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does to you. (Hope you like being hung upside down while someone beats the soles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of your feet.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, there's no doubt that drugs are punished harshly, and I was wrong
<BR>
to ascribe &quot;conspiracy&quot; to your characterization of the ruling class, but
<BR>
the fact that drug use is punished harshly doesn't show that drugs are, in
<BR>
fact, threatening to the ruling class.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That explains why the ruling class supports _prescription_ drugs as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-administered and self-procured drugs. This element of the overall situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does become important.
</EM><BR>
<P>So why not make marijuana a prescription drug?  Or opium?  Again, we can
<BR>
characterize this behavior as foolishness, (since opiating the masses
<BR>
would be wiser than forbidding the use of opium,) but I don't see how you
<BR>
can consistently characterize this as the ruling class trying to protect
<BR>
their ruling status.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;You might argue that the Government is acting foolishly, then, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that it's covering its own backside by outlawing drug use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find it amusing that the idea of opposition to drugs by the ruling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class would elicit such responses. Sounds like you have an axe to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grind here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I DO have an axe to grind.  All too often I hear people ascribe all sorts
<BR>
of crazy behavior to the &quot;ruling class,&quot; usually in a conspiratorial mood,
<BR>
though not always, and invariably with little explanation.  No
<BR>
prostitution?  Blame the man.  Can't smoke up?  Blame the man.  Late to
<BR>
work?  Somewhere, somehow, the man's responsible.
<BR>
<P>Sure, the &quot;ruling class&quot; does all sorts of crazy things.  But more often
<BR>
than not you'd be misrepresenting it in the extreme to characterize it as
<BR>
acting upon clearly identifiable class interests.
<BR>
