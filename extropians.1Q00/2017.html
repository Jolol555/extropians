<EM>&gt; You are absolutely right.  What was I thinking?  The police force and

<EM>&gt; prosecutors would not arrest and prosecute one of their own!  That is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly why the system failed.
</EM><BR>
<P>An alternative solution: create a second police system with no power to
<BR>
investigate or arrest private citizens, and charge it with investigate the
<BR>
criminal activities of public officials and the regular police force.  That
<BR>
gives you a special interest that actually benefits from prosecuting these
<BR>
kinds of offenses, instead of trying to cover them up.
<BR>
<P>Of course, then you have to worry about abuses by this new police force, but
<BR>
cops and public officials are in a much better position to defend themselves
<BR>
against corrupt prosecutors than an ordinary citizen.
