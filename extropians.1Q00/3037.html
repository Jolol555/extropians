Tell ya what, when scientists are hitting the news with humans volunteers 
<BR>
being revived (before death!) fromcryo-sleep/preservation--the world will 
<BR>
beat a path to Alcor's door.  Good luck and success!- -
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It sure will!!!  BUT, the technology to do this is a LONG way off, 
<BR>
especially considering how little money is spent on it.  Even the cryonics 
<BR>
organizations out there, having relatively minor resources, don't see 
<BR>
research for this goal as practical.
<BR>
<P>I wish the pentagon would allocate a good fifty million to try to achieve 
<BR>
this so mortally wounded troops could be saved.  But again, they see this 
<BR>
technology as just too far off to bother researching.  Of course the cost, 
<BR>
skills needed to do it and the nature of the equipment would make 
<BR>
implementing this out in the field extremely hard.
<BR>
<P>Robert Ettinger stated recently that if this technology were perfected you 
<BR>
would see extremely well-funded startups spring up that would leave Alcor 
<BR>
and CI in the dust.  This would be one case of people not minding being 
<BR>
beaten by the competition.
<BR>
<P>For now, the realistic goal is to simply improve the currently nonreversible 
<BR>
methods of cryonic suspension, as to cause as little damage to brain 
<BR>
structure as possible.
<BR>
