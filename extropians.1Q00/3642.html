<EM>&gt; Heh heh. Recently I've been getting into this ant stuff - I wrote a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little simulator for Linux/OpenGL and called it emergAnt...
</EM><BR>
<P>If we could write a really good ant colony sim, I would be convinced
<BR>
that we could write a neuron sim, interconnect a bunch of em to
<BR>
make a brain sim.  Then of course, Eliezer's Singularity results and
<BR>
we all perish.  But on a brighter note... {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd also like to model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warrior ants - they would attack workers from rival colonies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releasing clouds of war scent to attract their friends, etc. It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make a terrific screen saver.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually all the workers are potential warriors, depending on the sitch,
<BR>
methinks.  This sim seems like an enormously difficult task.  Ants do a
<BR>
lotta things which seem to defy explanation.  One hears that mankind
<BR>
is the only animal that makes war.  This nonsense is stated by one
<BR>
who has never taken three minutes to observe ants, which not only
<BR>
make war, they will fight to the last gal.
<BR>
<P>During a battle, two opposing ants will run up to each other and
<BR>
wave antennae for several seconds, which on the ant scale would
<BR>
be equivalent to a few hours.  What is going on with that?  Are they
<BR>
arguing?  [ &quot;Hey you!  Na4Cl3C7COOH!&quot;  &quot;Oh yeah?  Well
<BR>
ClO3SiO2F5CaCl2 to you, sister!&quot;  &quot;Thems fightin chemicals...&quot;]
<BR>
Then they start in with the mandibles.
<BR>
<P>Not only that, they play for keeps!  An ant gets her thorax torn
<BR>
off, she still wont relax her grip until her opponent is cold dead.
<BR>
Then she calmly scoops up the severed aft section and walks away
<BR>
with it.  Vince Lombardy would loooove this animal.
<BR>
<P>Hey, Matt, back when I made the other ant farm I bought 4
<BR>
pieces of glass planning to make 2 ant farms.  Only made one,
<BR>
which perished in the move to the Bay area, but I still have the
<BR>
other two pieces of glass.  Think Ill build that other one.  We can
<BR>
fool with your ant sim until it produces results that match the real
<BR>
thing.
<BR>
<P>Then we can play the info game and Ill really stump you with how
<BR>
many pets do I have.  Stump me too: it becomes a bit unclear how
<BR>
to even count ones ants.  {8-]  spike
