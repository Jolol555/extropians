<EM>&gt; &gt;                                         - Robert Frost  (l923)

<EM>&gt; You have to have lived through a New Hampshire winter, comparable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the winters were like back then (this one started off pretty good),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to understand his perspective. In the year Frost penned that, three dams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and several bridges on the Connecticutt River here in NH were wiped out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by ice floes. The 'wintah' of '78 was a good one as well. Its why the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Army's CRREL (Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory) Center
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is based about six miles away from me.

<P>Very informative, Mike.  But what really pleases me is the mere FACT that
<BR>
we are having a conversation and not ONLY a difference of opinion about
<BR>
an &quot;issue&quot; which is entirely too complex for facile generalization and where
<BR>
emotional factors probably play a larger role in forming convictions than
<BR>
purely logical considerations -- and I DO include myself in this class.
<BR>
<P>The way I try to suppress the emotional component is to focus on pre-
<BR>
vention rather than causation.  I received a letter from a friend informing
<BR>
me that I ought to carefully consider the results of the Australian scheme.
<BR>
I am doing that.  I only mention this because I want you to believe that
<BR>
I have NO FINAL VIEWPOINT on this subject.  In fact, I'm a bit of a
<BR>
know-nothing here -- I'm prepared to go with whatever works when we
<BR>
take the problems we are trying to solve one by one.
<BR>
<P>I mean this quite radically; if we discovered good reasons to believe that
<BR>
the free distribution of 410 riot shotguns, or 410s to the ladies and 12
<BR>
gauges to the gentlemen, by the government to every household in the
<BR>
United States, with the National Rifle Association providing the required
<BR>
educational services, I would support a pilot project to this effect both
<BR>
intellectually and by a financial contribution if necessary.
<BR>

<BR>
