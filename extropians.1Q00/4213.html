<EM>&gt;I'm afraid I can't completely share your optimism, at least initially. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things on the Extropian agenda could potentially come under legal purview.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Christian groups have been shown to be highly effective lobbyists, and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not been hesitant to block the approval of medical innovations which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;challenged &quot;traditional values.&quot; Good examples of this would be RU486, late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;term abortions, and assisted suicide. And the problems won't be just with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evangelists. The bozos that were sounding the alarms about the UPC code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and remember Ronald Wilson Reagan = 666?) weren't the same heavy hitters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(e.g. bishops and leaders of major denominations) that would get into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fray when you start talking about totally redefining basic terms such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;life&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; and even assigning god-like attributes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machines. Various legitimate ethical questions will undoubtedly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approached from biblical perspectives, as absurd as such a juxtaposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may seem, which could well have at least a da!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mpening effect. Like it or not, the religious types are very effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizers, and can do much to influence our freedoms. I think we'd better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get really used to hearing the accusation &quot;playing God.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Regards,

<P>I don't necessarily disagree with you, but (notwithstanding the fact that 
<BR>
the political power of the Christian right is already coming into question), 
<BR>
the Christian power brokers get their power from the loyalty and support of 
<BR>
Joe and Jane True-believer.  Christians may differ from nontheists in some 
<BR>
relatively few practical ways, but one thing *everyone* is in favor of is 
<BR>
abundant wealth and health.  Once those of us who embrace way-out-tech start 
<BR>
reaping benefits like ubiquitous wealth and vigourous living well past our 
<BR>
100 year mark, I don't think it will be long before Joe and Jane 
<BR>
True-believer start to seriously question the wisdom of their fundamentalist 
<BR>
neo-Luddite leaders.
