<P>True.  But Nanosystems or Nanomedicine are not exactly lounge chair
<BR>
by the pool on vacation reading (at least for most of the population).
<BR>
Robert did mention at one point though that his publisher was *amazed*
<BR>
that Nanosystems had sold that many copies.  Apparently, after the
<BR>
libraries get their copy (estimate some large fraction of the number
<BR>
of institutions with engineering or medical schools...) the sales for
<BR>
technical books of this nature are *very* low.  So, there is enough
<BR>
interest out there to get people to sit down and wrestle with something
<BR>
that may be out of their field or generally over their head.
<BR>
<P>Just a reminder -- for those of you living in major metropolitan regions,
<BR>
you might want to call up your local city or university library and find
<BR>
out if they have *both* Nanosystems and Nanomedicine (as well as Engines
<BR>
of Creation and Prospects in Nanotechnology).  Educate your librarian and
<BR>
let them educate others...  If you need a selling point, you might say
<BR>
that the Federal Government is increasing nanotechnology funding to
<BR>
$500 million annually.  How can people apply for grants if the libraries
<BR>
don't have the background information???
