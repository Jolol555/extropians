<BR>
<P>A bunch of fascinating questions, which I've had the temerity to try to 
<BR>
answer to the best of my abilities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1) Are the sources of the gravitational microlensing observations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    universally distributed around our galaxy and are they engineered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    objects?  [a subset of What is the Missing Mass?].
</EM><BR>
<P>A partial answer can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/">http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/</A> 
<BR>
which has released a map of the dark matter in a small patch of sky, as 
<BR>
deduced from carefully observed microlensing events. It looks awfully 
<BR>
fractal. Something as small as galaxy only shows up as a blob though, so 
<BR>
its hard to say what the local distribution looks like. If something 
<BR>
engineered this result, then they are waaaay scarey indeed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) What are the speed-limits to self-replication?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) What are the speed-limits to evolution?
</EM><BR>
<P>Are these questions about the absolute limits under any circumstance (at 
<BR>
which point I would say it looks to be around 1E-30 to 1E-40 seconds for 
<BR>
both questions), or is it a question about what parameters are critical to 
<BR>
setting a particular speed limit under particular circumstances. This is a 
<BR>
far more complex, and IMHO a far more interesting question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4) How many really useful &quot;biochemistries&quot; (i.e. chemical systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that can support self-replicating self-assembling machines)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    are there and which of those can arise without conscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    intervention?  [A variant of &quot;How big is the phase-space for life?&quot;]
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are limiting yourself to chemistry then the answer depends on how 
<BR>
big a difference is necessary to consider two biochemistries 'distinct'. I 
<BR>
saw a well reasoned estimate once (which I only vaguely recall, so take 
<BR>
the following with a grain of salt) that argued that carbon chemistry has 
<BR>
many structures used by life that perform functions that are hard to 
<BR>
perform in silicon or any other base for 'organic' forms. So at this level 
<BR>
the answer is 1. If you then look at the basic building blocks of life, 
<BR>
the amino acids, you find that there are hundreds, and the set earth life 
<BR>
uses is somewhere around 20. That gives a rough estimate of 5E20 
<BR>
biochemistries. So much for being able to eat alien food plants. At an 
<BR>
even higher level, the number of ways of encoding information for self-
<BR>
replication purposes seems unbounded. So much for the 'everyone has DNA' 
<BR>
assumption of bad science fiction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5) Are there feasible ways of creating alterverses, particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    those where you have rigged the fundamental physical laws and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    constants?  [Interesting because I'm pretty sure we are doomed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    if all the baryonic matter decays and universe-tunneling is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    disallowed.]
</EM><BR>
<P>The jury is still out on this one. All of the papers I've ever seen on the 
<BR>
matter (and there haven't been many) seem to require unwaranted 
<BR>
assumptions about the structure of space-time and/or the existance of 
<BR>
exotic (and purely theoretical) forms of matter. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 6) What is the probability that an amoral, self-evolving, self-replicating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    AI/Alife can develop and &quot;breakout&quot; by accident?  { After all, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    computers and the net *are* an environmental niche... }
</EM><BR>
<P>About the same probability that a chemist mixing amino acids in a lab will 
<BR>
accidentally create a plague-form capable of wiping out our species.
<BR>
<P>Note that this is a vastly lower probability than the chance that a 
<BR>
deliberately constructed, amoral, self-evolving, self-replicating AI/Alife 
<BR>
will &quot;breakout&quot; by accident.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 8) What is the molecular size to which a human body must be reduced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that molecular nanotechnology cannot reassemble you?  [At some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    point you end up with too many 3D pieces that look identical, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    too little positional information, to reassemble Humpty Dumpty.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Oog. Good question. The answer is clearly related to the question of what 
<BR>
is the actual non-redundant information content of a human body. Clearly 
<BR>
humans are massively redundant with structures copied at all scales in the 
<BR>
trillions. I know I've seen estimates of this latter number somewhere, but 
<BR>
I'm drawing a blank.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 7) What do SIs think about over trillions of years?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 9) What are the optimal computing architecures for what SIs think about?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that both of these questions are fundamentally unknowable at our 
<BR>
level of technology. We can't even answer the (much simpler) questions of 
<BR>
what do humans think about over decades, and what is the optimal computing 
<BR>
architecture for this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And number 10, on RBs Top-Ten-List is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10) Am I going to make it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     [Because if Robin is right about the spoils going to the first, *or*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Eliezer is successful in creating a fundamentally different AI, *or*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      the luddites rise up and drive us back a century or more, *or* *or*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      *or*...  my feeling is that the odds aren't good.  But(!), arriving is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      not so important as having an enjoyable journey.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Choosing a strategy for survival is tough. All I can think of to do 
<BR>
is to study as many relevant fields of knowledge as I can, so that I will 
<BR>
at least be well informed of my options at each point along the way.
