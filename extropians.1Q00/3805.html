<P>
<EM>&gt;  So far Au is still gold standard in dental materials. Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  aesthetically less than perfect, but toxicologically uncontroversial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and damn durable. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... Au is NOT the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard in dental materials.  It was... 50 years ago, but believe it or not, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dental technology has actually significantly advanced since 1950!  And your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quote, 'the polymer doesn't age well'.  I, like most dentists, have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using polymers for years and years, and I would choose a polymer restorative 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way over dental gold, or amalgams anytime.
</EM><BR>

<P>Hmm.  My own experience (from the other side of the chair) supports gold.
<BR>
I have polymer fillings on visible surfaces, but when I had to get a crown
<BR>
on one a bit further back my dentist recommended gold as more reliable.
<BR>
I have since had to replace at least one polymer crown, but the gold one
<BR>
never gives me any trouble.  This was not very long ago: perhaps 5 years.
<BR>
Is my dentist just using the wrong polymers, or are you perhaps putting
<BR>
too much faith in them?
<BR>
