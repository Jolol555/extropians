<EM>&gt; radical era).  In some of the literature, I read about this, it was argued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there was a legal basis for a jury providing a 3rd trial outcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (other than finding the defendent guilty or non-guilty).  They could in
</EM><BR>
fact
<BR>
<EM>&gt; find the law &quot;invalid&quot;.  Durk and Sandy argued that this would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best way to get law under which the FDA was attempting to control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supplement distribution and product &quot;claims&quot; thrown out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know whether or not this is the case and whether this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense has ever been tried for the people to &quot;take back the government&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is known as jury nullification and has its basis in common law going
<BR>
back, I believe, to the late 1600s.  Even though it seems in line with
<BR>
American law, judges usually treat any call for jury nullification as jury
<BR>
tampering.  FIJA is an organization dedicated to making sure people are
<BR>
aware of jury nullification.  Its web site is at <A HREF="http://www.fija.org/">http://www.fija.org/</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, that question being asked, then one gets back to my original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question regarding &quot;peers&quot;.  I would consider &quot;peers&quot; to be either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agnostics or athiests.  When defense selects juries, can they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only select people that fall into those categories since they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are presumably the only people capable of coming to rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusions based on the evidence presented.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know many atheists and so called agnostics who are irrational.
