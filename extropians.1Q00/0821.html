<P>
Nick,
<BR>
<P>I hope that you get this in time.  This is my meager attempt at
<BR>
providing
<BR>
some of those &quot;controversial&quot; sound bites you would like.
<BR>
<P>If it turns out that the producers move forward with this and you can
<BR>
give me enough advance notice, I might be able to come to England
<BR>
to participate (dropping in on a flight between Seattle and Russia).
<BR>
<P>So, here are some pithy statements:
<BR>
<P>“According to Robert Bradbury, president of Aeiveos, an aging research
<BR>
firm, life-extension advocates must also fight several other foes: human
<BR>
naturalists, religious deathists, and bureaucratic fearmongers.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wired Magazine, August, 1999
<BR>
<P>“If we can eliminate the major causes of death (heart disease, cancer,
<BR>
diabetes, etc.) and the underlying causes of aging (that we must still
<BR>
discover), then people will die only from accidents.  Using the Y2K
<BR>
accident rate in Western countries, this would provide an average
<BR>
lifespan of approximately 2000 years.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robert Bradbury, American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine
<BR>
Conference,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December, 1999
<BR>
<P>“It doesn’t take being clever, or having the right education, or knowing
<BR>
the right people or even being lucky to get very very rich.  It simply
<BR>
requires living long enough.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robert Bradbury, circa 1995
<BR>
<P>“During the ten year period from 1995 to 2005, the costs for research to
<BR>
understand the fundamental causes of aging (i.e. the genetic
<BR>
predispositions and the fundamental analysis of the changes in gene
<BR>
expression that occur during aging), will decline by a factor of 100,
<BR>
perhaps as much as 1000 times.  This is probably unprecedented in the
<BR>
history of scientific research -- for the costs of understanding
<BR>
something affecting every single human being to move from the realm of
<BR>
being prohibitively expensive to the realm where almost any scientist
<BR>
can productively work in the field in such a brief period of time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robert Bradbury, Results of studies conducted by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aeiveos Sciences Group  during the fall of 1996.
<BR>
<P>“The problem with all of the predictions to the ‘Limits of Growth”’ is
<BR>
that they assume there are no changes in technologies that support
<BR>
societies.  Because of this, they are fundamentally faulty and will
<BR>
provide universally incorrect conclusions.  The only near term limits to
<BR>
growth that exist are the of the full utilization of the entire power
<BR>
output of the sun and most of the usable matter in the solar system.
<BR>
Until we get to that point, there is little to be concerned about.”
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robert Bradbury, Conclusions of the limits of evolution within
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solar systems derived from the studies of Matrioshka Brains.
<BR>
<P>The first objection that people raise when contemplating living
<BR>
indefinately is the overpopulation problem.  I have to tell them, that
<BR>
I’ve traveled by ground across the United States and parts of Canada on
<BR>
many occasions.  I’ve also flown over large portions of Europe, Russia
<BR>
and the Pacific Ocean.  I’ve got news for them -- the world is empty,
<BR>
completely and desolately empty.  While we may have problems in selected
<BR>
cities or suburbs where population densities are high, the world as a
<BR>
whole has many centuries to go before it reaches this stage.  By then,
<BR>
most people will probably prefer to live in space anyway if only because
<BR>
“land” is cheaper and there is much more power available.  We can look
<BR>
forward to an era when individuals residing on planets would be
<BR>
considered to be living in the slums.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robert Bradbury, reflections on the impacts of increased
<BR>
longevity.
<BR>
<P>Also, there is further background information in my somewhat dated paper
<BR>
on the Issues Involved in Longevity @ <A HREF="http://www.aeiveos.com/issues.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/issues.html</A>
