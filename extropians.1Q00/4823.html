<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not true that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; NRA opposes any attempt reduce the production of new guns?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The federal government is not permitted to control the quantity of guns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produced except under martial law conditions. The government does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;make the guns, it is a private industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your statement does not negate the truth of mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have yet to show that your statement has any merit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the NRA is opposed to reducing the number of guns now in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Gun buybacks have been shown to have absolutely no effect on crime. Gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;confiscations would obviously start a civil war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, your statement does not negate the truth of mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have yet to show that your statement has any merit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not true that there are more guns in America than there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Americans?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No there are not. There are over 250 million Americans, and between 200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and 240 million guns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where do you get this statistic?  What is the date of it?  And even if it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurate, what practical difference does it make?  Especially when you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider that a fair percentage of the Americans included in the statistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consist of children, infants, invalids, convicts and ex-convicts?  Even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assuming the accuracy of your statistic, surely the number of guns far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outnumbers the number of sane, competent and law-abiding adults who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally permitted to own them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;   Is it not true that the NRA sees no problem with the ratio of guns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; people?  Please stop me when I've said something that is not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ok, I have stopped you. The only people who see a problem with this are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;those that think that Americans have no right to keep and bear arms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Such people are fascists and should be treated as such.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, your statement does not negate the truth of mine.  Furthermore, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement is untrue.  I think there is a problem with a country that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contains more guns than legal gun-owners.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I have:
<BR>
1) two pistols of different sizes for personal protection (each for use
<BR>
in different climates or social situations).
<BR>
2) a shotgun for bird hunting and clay target shooting
<BR>
3) a muzzle loading rifle for hunting deer during muzzle loading deer
<BR>
hunting season.
<BR>
4) a .270 semiautomatic hunting rifle for use during regular deer
<BR>
hunting season
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Especially when that country
</EM><BR>
5) a .300 winmag Savage 110 Tactical target rifle to compete in high
<BR>
power bolt action rifle matches.
<BR>
6) a compact collapsable .22 rifle for carrying on hiking/canoe trips
<BR>
(the gun floats when its parts are stowed inside its stock).
<BR>
7) a .44 caliber muzzle loading percussion revolver, a reproduction of a
<BR>
Colt 1860 Navy Pistol, which I use as an alternate sidearm during deer
<BR>
season.
<BR>
8) an M-11 submachine gun with a supressor, which I use for fun at the
<BR>
range.
<BR>
<P>I plan on getting two or three more guns this year for hunting purposes.
<BR>
Every gun I own, or plan on owning, has its own purpose, none of which
<BR>
is to commit crimes. I happen to know gun collectors, who have never
<BR>
fired a round in anger, who own over 20,000 guns each. They are not
<BR>
militia nuts, they are not white supremacists, and they are not gang
<BR>
bangers or gun dealers. They are law abiding citizens, many who are well
<BR>
respected in the community, who like to collect guns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; compounds that problem by a complete failure to make these dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instrumentalities as safe as they can practically be, and the fact that gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owners unnecessarily enjoy more anonymity than car owners.  
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't have a right to drive a car, it is a priviledge, and btw, any
<BR>
felon can get a drivers license, even though cars kill more people than
<BR>
guns (and there are fewer cars than guns), and its far easier for a
<BR>
felon to buy a car than a gun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Japan does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow every wacko in the country to own a gun.  Does that make the Japanese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government a fascist regime?
</EM><BR>
<P>yes it does. tyranny by majority, and a historical desire to please
<BR>
their conquerors (we made them give up their guns). Japan's violent
<BR>
crime rate has also been skyrocketing the last few years....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;The tree of liberty, from time to time, needs to be watered with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;blood of tyrants and patriots.&quot;  - Thomas Jefferson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  But it bothers me that it is usually the 2nd Amendment hardliners
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who feel that they get to do the watering.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who else would? Nobody else thinks that their freedoms are more
<BR>
important that having a police state gestapo telling them what to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Isn't this fun?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marginally.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;If you can't stand the heat...&quot;
