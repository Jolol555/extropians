<P>ahem.  Years ago I was watching ants and became
<BR>
obsessed with them.  (surprise!)  I wanted to see what would
<BR>
happen if you took one single ant, isolated her in an ant farm with
<BR>
plenty of food and water.  Would she make a single tunnel
<BR>
like on the BC comics, with one chamber?  Or would she try
<BR>
to make an entire tunnel system like the many, only slower?
<BR>
Or would she just kick back, do nothing, go around looking
<BR>
for something to bite, what?
<BR>
<P>I did make a really cool ant farm with sheets of glass one meter
<BR>
by .61 meters (golden ratio).  I isolated one ant.  She died.  I
<BR>
took another.  She died.  I tried the experiment with two ants.
<BR>
They both died.  Now all I know  is how to exterminate ants.    spike
