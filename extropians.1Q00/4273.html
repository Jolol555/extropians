&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always thought putting electromagnetic strips
<BR>
on the outside of most buildings and on all of the
<BR>
cars might be pretty convenient.  You know, have a
<BR>
little impact potential reader that would turn the
<BR>
suckers on when anything started careening towards it.
<BR>
&nbsp;I could imagine some car bouncing around like crasy,
<BR>
repulsing off of everything until it's momentum ran
<BR>
down a bit from air friction... of course, this would
<BR>
only work well where there were a lot of buildings to
<BR>
repulse off of.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything would still have to be pretty
<BR>
tough, it's just that with an electromagnet you can
<BR>
pull effects similar to springs... you know, the car
<BR>
is strongly repelled and then less strongly repelled a
<BR>
fraction of a second later so that it doesn't just
<BR>
crunch... you could have a designation, like all cars
<BR>
would have north facing sort of inward and south
<BR>
outward all the way around.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might even have the building and the cars use
<BR>
several electromagnets... like the buildings repulse
<BR>
strongly while the ground attracts or whatnot... not
<BR>
powerfully attracts, the car and the ground would
<BR>
compensate... not sure.  It'd be fairly complex, I
<BR>
imagine that it would involve several embedded
<BR>
computers and gps type systems to track the movements
<BR>
of all of the vehicles.  Expensive... but fun.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with computer controlled vehicles, any
<BR>
sort of problem that required such a system might
<BR>
cause the system itself to go out.  You'd need
<BR>
something almost automatic.  Maybe the car could have
<BR>
a fairly powerfull repulsive electromagnet and an
<BR>
emergency circuit.  When damage approached, the
<BR>
circuit would complete, powering the magnets and
<BR>
sending the car skyrocketing upwards to be towed
<BR>
away... maybe the buildings could act like one way
<BR>
doors... so that if the car went up, it couldn't come
<BR>
down while it was out of control, and the shape of the
<BR>
magnetic field itself might be funnellike so it
<BR>
couldn't go careening away... ok, so this is massively
<BR>
expensive.  And it would take a ton of power.  But,
<BR>
you have to admit... it *would* be a lot of fun to
<BR>
watch.
