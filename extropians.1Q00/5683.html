Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So here is a question (that I actually don't know the answer to...),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What is the shortest lived mammal?  Or other short lived species
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you could use as models for some aspects of aging in humans?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I seem to recall vaguely there were some unusual animals from Australia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that had short lifespans.  What about up there in Alaska, got any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seasonal species John?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure but I would say the male Anthecinus (marsupial mice); it lives
<BR>
only 1 year (one of the few cases of sudden death or Big Bang reproduction
<BR>
in mammals). However it should be noticed that females live longer and even
<BR>
males can live up to 3 years in the lab. But even looking at the maximum
<BR>
life span under optimal conditions, I'm not aware of any mammal living less
<BR>
than 3 years although certainly many rodents come close.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Short-lived organisms allow scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do experiments and intervention tests more quickly.
</EM><BR>
<P>True but I don't think you can locate the causes of human aging in
<BR>
short-lived species. Of course you can use them as transgenics to
<BR>
investigate human genes and investigate the basic metabolic processes than
<BR>
can fail during aging; but I believe that to understand human aging you
<BR>
can't base your research on short-lived species for the simple reason that,
<BR>
based on evolutionary theory, they age for different causes than us
<BR>
(although some metabolic pathways or genes might be common but following
<BR>
that reasoning you can also study bacteria since the basic processes of life
<BR>
are common to all organisms except virus). To put it simple: Why learn from
<BR>
species that are behind us in the race for immortality.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
