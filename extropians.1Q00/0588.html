<P>Access to space will be likely tightly controlled by powerful
<BR>
corporations until the claims have been established. After the Solar
<BR>
system turf has been divided, it will be then safe to release the
<BR>
plebs upon it. Due to initial blueprint and all-purpose assembler
<BR>
scarcity (for the same reasons), nano is unlikely to be of much
<BR>
assistance here.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; treaties prevent &quot;claiming&quot; land in space (or at least on the Moon), so if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you attempted executing this you would be creating a reason for the U.S. &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Russia to send a space destroyer after you.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is utterly unenforcible, since you can be literally get lost in
<BR>
the Oort cloud somewhere.
<BR>
<P>And it is difficult to wage war physically (i.e. other than
<BR>
infowarfare) in a remote developed location (say, a processed
<BR>
asteroid, Luna suface is probably too near). A few hundred km^2 of
<BR>
photovoltaics surface gives you serious firepower against any large
<BR>
destroyer. The only way is to try it with stealth, sending a lot of
<BR>
very black, speedy, hardened nukes which detonate in your midst. As we
<BR>
already discussed, nukes are relatively useless as means of attack
<BR>
against a cloud of self-gravity bound distributed objects. You also
<BR>
could certainly retaliate horribly, Earth is a very vulnerable place.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; An extropic approach, instead of repeating all the examples of previous
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; mistakes, should try to focus on those areas where there are &quot;loopholes&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that people didn't envision due to limited previous meme-sets.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I think it would be wise not to present a physical attack target. A
<BR>
distributed, largely virtual tribe would do just fine, until access to
<BR>
space is open.
