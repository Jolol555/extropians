<P><EM>&gt; The Thompson hack basically lets you create compilers that scan their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; input stream for some signature and snitch on you (or execute some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrary payload) if they see it. The nasty sting in the tail of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this idea is that the scanner/payload isn't visible in the source code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the compiler; because one of the scanner/payload combinations in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contaminated compiler is designed to add the patch whenever it recognizes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its own source code being re-compiled. With application to assemblers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or, more likely, their control software aboard the nanocomputers used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to direct them), this would mean that if you try to assemble some grey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo, the assembler will recognize the grey goo, and assemble something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else instead -- probably a pair of handcuffs.  And you can't build an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assembler that _won't_ snitch on you without doing it by hand, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involving any off-the-shelf assemblers in the process: because they'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to propagate the Thompson hack into your new &quot;clean&quot; assembler.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is one way things may go, but I'm not sure the &quot;Thompson hack&quot;
<BR>
would be the preferred way to prevent assemblers from building dangerous
<BR>
objects.  The unique aspect of Thompson's idea was that the compiler
<BR>
would recognize when it was compiling itself, and build the hack into
<BR>
the new compiler, even though it wasn't present in the source code.
<BR>
<P>It does seem reasonable that assemblers would be limited in some ways,
<BR>
but this particular method has disadvantages.  It relies on secrecy,
<BR>
and if everyone knows it's there you might as well do things openly.
<BR>
It also is somewhat brittle in that the code can't change much or the
<BR>
hack won't recognize where it has to insert itself in the new version.
<BR>
<P>I suspect it would be more likely that an assembler (by which I mean
<BR>
a large device which might be in a home and used to build clothes,
<BR>
furnishings, electronics, etc.) will have a catalog of devices it can
<BR>
build, with variations that can be programmed in.  Maybe one assembler
<BR>
can build another, but you wouldn't have control at the level of making
<BR>
changes to remove limitations on what it could build, any more than a
<BR>
MUD program lets you drop into assembly language.
<BR>
<P>An interesting example though of where secrecy is used for somewhat
<BR>
similar purposes to what you desribe: recently there have been articles
<BR>
revealing that color copiers each have a unique digital &quot;fingerprint&quot;
<BR>
which they embed into copies.  Given a copy it is possible to trace it
<BR>
back to the exact machine which made it.  This is intended as an anti
<BR>
counterfeiting measure.  Most people have been unaware of this (although
<BR>
rumors have been around for years).  See the well respected Privacy
<BR>
