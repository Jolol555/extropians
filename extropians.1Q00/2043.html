<P>Incompetent People Really Have No Clue, Studies Find They're
<BR>
blind to own failings, others' skills
<BR>
<P>Erica Goode, New York Times
<BR>
<P>Tuesday, January 18, 2000 ©2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<BR>
<P>There are many incompetent people in the world. Dr. David A.
<BR>
Dunning is haunted by the fear that he might be one of them.
<BR>
Dunning, a professor of psychology at Cornell, worries about this
<BR>
because, according to his research, most incompetent people
<BR>
do not know that they are incompetent.
<BR>
<P>On the contrary. People who do things badly, Dunning has found
<BR>
in studies conducted with a graduate student, Justin Kruger, are
<BR>
usually supremely confident of their abilities -- more confident, in
<BR>
fact, than people who do things well.
<BR>
<P>``I began to think that there were probably lots of things that I
<BR>
was bad at, and I didn't know it,'' Dunning said.
<BR>
<P>One reason that the ignorant also tend to be the blissfully
<BR>
self-assured, the researchers believe, is that the skills required
<BR>
for competence often are the same skills necessary to recognize
<BR>
competence.
<BR>
<P>The incompetent, therefore, suffer doubly, they suggested in a
<BR>
paper appearing in the December issue of the Journal of Personality
<BR>
and Social Psychology.
<BR>
<P>``Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate
<BR>
choices, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize
<BR>
it,'' wrote Kruger, now an assistant professor at the University of
<BR>
Illinois, and Dunning.
<BR>
<P>This deficiency in ``self-monitoring skills,'' the researchers said,
<BR>
helps explain the tendency of the humor-impaired to persist in
<BR>
telling jokes that are not funny, of day traders to repeatedly jump
<BR>
into the market -- and repeatedly lose out -- and of the politically
<BR>
clueless to continue holding forth at dinner parties on the fine
<BR>
points of campaign strategy.
<BR>
<P>In a series of studies, Kruger and Dunning tested their theory of
<BR>
incompetence. They found that subjects who scored in the lowest
<BR>
quartile on tests of logic, English grammar and humor were also the
<BR>
most likely to ``grossly overestimate'' how well they had performed.
<BR>
In all three tests, subjects' ratings of their ability were positively
<BR>
linked to their actual scores. But the lowest-ranked participants
<BR>
showed much greater distortions in their self-estimates.
<BR>
<P>Asked to evaluate their performance on the test of logical
<BR>
reasoning, for example, subjects who scored only in the 12th
<BR>
percentile guessed that they had scored in the 62nd percentile,
<BR>
and deemed their overall skill at logical reasoning to be at the 68th
<BR>
percentile.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, subjects who scored at the 10th percentile on the
<BR>
grammar test ranked themselves at the 67th percentile in the
<BR>
ability to ``identify grammatically correct standard English,''
<BR>
and estimated their test scores to be at the 61st percentile.
<BR>
<P>On the humor test, in which participants were asked to rate
<BR>
jokes according to their funniness (subjects' ratings were
<BR>
matched against those of an ``expert'' panel of professional
<BR>
comedians), low-scoring subjects were also more apt to have
<BR>
an inflated perception of their skill. But because humor is
<BR>
idiosyncratically defined, the researchers said, the results
<BR>
were less conclusive.
<BR>
<P>Unlike unskilled counterparts, the most able subjects in the
<BR>
study, Kruger and Dunning found, were likely to underestimate
<BR>
their competence. The researchers attributed this to the fact
<BR>
that, in the absence of information about how others were doing,
<BR>
highly competent subjects assumed that others were performing
<BR>
as well as they were -- a phenomenon psychologists term the
<BR>
``false consensus effect.''
<BR>
<P>When high-scoring subjects were asked to ``grade'' the
<BR>
grammar tests of their peers, however, they quickly revised
<BR>
their evaluations of their own performance. In contrast, the
<BR>
self-assessments of those who scored badly themselves were
<BR>
unaffected by the experience of grading others; some subjects
<BR>
even further inflated their estimates of their own abilities.
<BR>
<P>``Incompetent individuals were less able to recognize competence
<BR>
in others,'' the researchers concluded.
<BR>
<P>In a final experiment, Dunning and Kruger set out to discover if
<BR>
training would help modify the exaggerated self-perceptions of
<BR>
incapable subjects. In fact, a short training session in logical
<BR>
reasoning did improve the ability of low-scoring subjects to
<BR>
assess their performance realistically, they found.
<BR>
<P>The findings, the psychologists said, support Thomas Jefferson's
<BR>
assertion that ``he who knows best knows how little he knows.''
<BR>
And the research meshes neatly with other work indicating that
<BR>
overconfidence is common; studies have found, for example, that
<BR>
the vast majority of people rate themselves as ``above average''
<BR>
on a wide array of abilities -- though such an abundance of talent
<BR>
would be impossible in statistical terms. This overestimation,
<BR>
studies indicate, is more likely for tasks that are difficult than
<BR>
for those that are easy.
<BR>
<P>Such studies are not without critics. Dr. David C. Funder, a
<BR>
psychology professor at the University of California at Riverside,
<BR>
for example, said he suspects that most lay people have only
<BR>
a vague idea of the meaning of ``average'' in statistical terms.
<BR>
<P>``I'm not sure the average person thinks of `average' or
<BR>
`percentile' in quite that literal a sense,'' Funder said, ``so
<BR>
`above average' might mean to them `pretty good,' or `OK,'
<BR>
or `doing all right.' And if, in fact, people mean something
<BR>
subjective when they use the word, then it's really hard to
<BR>
evaluate whether they're right or wrong, using the statistical
<BR>
criterion.''
<BR>
<P>But Dunning said his current research and past studies
<BR>
indicated there are many reasons why people would tend
<BR>
to overestimate their competency and not be aware of it.
<BR>
<P>In various situations, feedback is absent, or at least ambiguous;
<BR>
even a humorless joke, for example, is likely to be met with
<BR>
polite laughter. And faced with incompetence, social norms
<BR>
prevent most people from blurting out ``You stink!'' -- truthful
<BR>
though this assessment may be.
