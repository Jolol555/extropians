Looking over the posts, I realise that a)lacking
<BR>
money, and b)lacking serious programming knowledge (I
<BR>
know a little bit of logo, javascript, html, dhtml,
<BR>
basic(ok, so I *used* to know a little bit of basic,
<BR>
when I was...around six, but close enough), and a
<BR>
*teensy* bit of VRML...but as far as C++ or any other
<BR>
&quot;serious&quot; programming languages, I may well be
<BR>
toast.... my suggestion that I help set up a
<BR>
searchable database (the extropian finder) might be a
<BR>
little ludicrous... I was just thinking something
<BR>
simple, like the search engines they stick in
<BR>
websites, linked to an index of some kind... All of a
<BR>
sudden I read through these posts and I hear talk
<BR>
about exchanging hardware platforms, setting up
<BR>
special computer systems... *mutters*  I don't think
<BR>
I'm going to be much help.  I could go out and find
<BR>
some photographs and digitally alter them if you want
<BR>
some nice art though... *laughs again*.  Hmmm... I
<BR>
think soon I'll start learning C++, it's one of those
<BR>
things that kind of nag at you... and it would be
<BR>
really usefull since I just downloaded some mud
<BR>
engines to play with...hey... *grins*
<BR>
what about an extropians game? *That* would be
<BR>
interesting.... all kinds of potential plots....
<BR>
uploaded killers copying themselves onto the internet
<BR>
and downloading all over... genetic warfare... lots of
<BR>
fun.  I think the best aspect of such a game would be
<BR>
that you could *use* technology to stop it's
<BR>
misuse...sort of like a lesson about how tools
<BR>
themselves aren't bad, it's just in whose hands they
<BR>
reside, stuff like that. Okay, maybe not the best
<BR>
aspect.  *grins*  The part where you get to
<BR>
singularity would be pretty cool:)  And when you get
<BR>
there, what do you do? Well, if it were something like
<BR>
a mud, I think it'd be neat to make those types into
<BR>
the admins.... sort of like when you reach level
<BR>
ninety nine on someplace like abandoned reality or
<BR>
Dark and Shattered Lands... *types random chaotic
<BR>
garbage while thinking about gaming systems*
<BR>
hee hee hee....
<BR>
another thought on a game would be that you could try
<BR>
to make it as advanced as possible- you know, the whol
<BR>
*nature* of extropianism not only captured in the plot
<BR>
but in the architecture... stuff like alife ecosystems
<BR>
of evolving monsters... *shrugs* I think you'd need to
<BR>
create even your own engine for something like that,
<BR>
or a significantly altered preexisting one.
<BR>
Anyways, this was more of a long and garbled spew than
<BR>
any intelligible thoughts..when it's not late at night
<BR>
with school in the morning I'd love to think up more
<BR>
fun things to do with everyone else's time:)
<BR>
Like writing semi-long posts about online gaming
<BR>
systems, for example:)
