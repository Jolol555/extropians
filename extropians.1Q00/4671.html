In the past M$ has copied all of the features of other products such
<BR>
as Netscape. Makes sense to me that they might feel like &quot;embracing
<BR>
and extending&quot; this &quot;feature&quot; too. I mean they gotta stay on top of
<BR>
Linux.
<BR>
<P>As for why would anyone use it, what if the domains were free or next
<BR>
to free? I think there is enough hatred out in Linux-land of the
<BR>
Network Solutions/ICANN monopoly that you could easily get a movement
<BR>
started for this. Maybe I should send these emails to RMS or someone
<BR>
and see if they latch onto it :-)

<EM>&gt; domain.tux.  But who'd want such a domain unless they're publishing only
