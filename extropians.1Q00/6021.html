<EM>&gt;It appears as if Zero Powers &lt;<A HREF="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000328220906.47755.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

<EM>&gt;|My guess is that Michael thinks I'm a fascist because I am in favor of gun

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The &quot;ubiquitous transparancy&quot; will _not_ appear suddenly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Instead, those who consider themselves the rulers of various areas of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;planet will make sure that _they_ get the surveillance to control the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and prohibiting the others from using the surveillance against them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In short, you get a dictatorship in which those with the big guns get to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;snoop on those with smaller (or no) guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well the transparency I advocate is mutual, two-way, transparency.  Meaning 
<BR>
that the individual would be no more subject to surveillance than the 
<BR>
government.  In fact my suggestion is &quot;power equivolent surveillance,&quot; such 
<BR>
that the more power you have to meddle in others lives, the *more* you are 
<BR>
subject to surveillance.  In this scheme, the President and members of 
<BR>
congress would live in a virtual fish bowl and we the people would be able 
<BR>
to know virtually *everything* about their political, business and personal 
<BR>
affairs.
<BR>
<P>In fact, I have to admit that I tend toward transparency fanaticism.  If I 
<BR>
were calling the shots there'd be no secrets, *none*.  I realize the 
<BR>
practical difficulties (if not impossibilities) in implementing this anytime 
<BR>
soon.  But I do foresee a time when ubiquitous transparency will not only be 
<BR>
doable, but will be absolutely necessary.
<BR>
<P>When we have gotten past national sovereignty and moved on to cooperative 
<BR>
democratic global governance, there will be no need for such things as state 
<BR>
secrets and national security.  At that point we will only be concerned with 
<BR>
(1) individual security and (2) global security.  Both of those types of 
<BR>
security would best be served by ubiquitous transparency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Since you also advocate gun control (meaning those with the big guns get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to disarm those with smaller guns), you advocate that those who consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves the rulers (a) get to snoop on everybody else, (b) one cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use weapons to overthrow them, and (c) you cannot find out what they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In short, you get a dictatorship which make the old ones, SSSR, Mainland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;China, and Nazi Germany look like democratic societies in comparison.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know the NRA doesn't like to let this be known but: &quot;gun control&quot; is not 
<BR>
synonymous with total disarmament.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Power corrupts, so why give the power brokers more of it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't advocate that at all.  I propose giving more power to those are less 
<BR>
powerful.  I do propose opening the flood gates of surveillance, but its a 
<BR>
two-way floodgate, and I'd call for more information about the government 
<BR>
flowing to the people than the other way around.
