<EM>&gt;&quot;Advances in the treatment of diphtheria (as opposed to its prevention),

<EM>&gt;in particular the discovery of antibiotics, have had only a minor effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on mortality.&quot; [p. 29]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Based on Cairns comments, I would change my previous statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that modern longevity is due to: (1) Education; (2) Nutrition;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(3) Sanitation; (4) Vaccines and (5) Antibiotics.  His discussions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regarding the health and infant mortality rates in modern countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would seem to confirm that public knowledge (e.g. prenatal nutrition)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and government health regulations (e.g. for clean drinking water) probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contribute much more to longevity than do medical practices.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you admit you are just guessing?  The evidence may have persuaded
<BR>
you that medicine wasn't a big influence, and these other ideas are
<BR>
plausible hypotheses, but that's all they are until you look at some
<BR>
more data.  From my reading of the data the only effect on your
<BR>
list that we have clear evidence for a large effect is nutrition.
<BR>
But it is hard to see nutrition as the whole effect, since rich people
<BR>
long ago who had plenty to eat died a lot more than poorer people today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But considering his Table 1.2:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;=========================================================
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Death Rates (per million) in England and Wales ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Total for all infectious diseases     12965        714
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Total for all non-infectious diseases  8891       4670 ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Source: T. McKeown, &quot;The Role of Medicine, Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis&quot;, 1976
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;===========================================================
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think you can discount sanitation and vaccines entirely.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the drop was concentrated in infectious diseases.  And that
<BR>
does make one think about sanitation and vaccines.  But look further
<BR>
at the evidence before deciding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I attribute the reduction in Cholera deaths &amp; other food &amp; water borne
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diseases directly to sanitation.
</EM><BR>
<P>What evidence would you cite?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Again, we may &quot;split&quot; hairs as to exactly what we call sanitation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cairns cites the availability of washable cotten clothes allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to actually bathe more frequently.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I know of data on is water sources and waste disposal sinks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is also a puzzle why the US spends 14% of GDP on medicine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cairns alludes to the # of doctors...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;And market forces will lead to an overabundance of doctors, becuase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is almost no limit to the opportunities for lucrative medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practice in countries with a rich aging population.
</EM><BR>
<P>The opportunities are large because the demand is large.  But why
<BR>
is the demand large?  That is just a restatement of the question.
