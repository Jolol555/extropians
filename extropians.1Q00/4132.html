<EM>&gt; &gt; Its this, friends:  most all of us here

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You rather make us sound like a bunch of inadequate personalities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering from a benign form of autism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very benign perhaps.  In my book, different is not bad, different
<BR>
is good.  In our world, different is...  what?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think it's quite as bad as that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes and I do not presume to speak for all here.  {8^D  If you
<BR>
relate, so be it, if not, into the bit bucket with it.

<P><EM>&gt;  Most of us would probably score relatively high in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introverted and intuitive thinking on the Briggs-Meyers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  As I recall we ran that experiment and we ran
<BR>
high on those scales.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall from Jung that introverted and extroverted personalities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a TERRIBLE time understanding each other, not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the communication difficulties of feeling and thinking types.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats it!  If you compare the results of extropians with the
<BR>
general population, we were way more T than F, the opposite
<BR>
of the majority.  Could it be as simple as that?  T vs F?  spike
