DANGER! DANGER!	  Politcal rant to follow.  Set memetic defenses to maximum.

<P><EM>&gt;Imperialism is extending a nation's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political hegemony over other nations.  The US is not doing this.  We are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basically acting as the referee in the world's international wrestling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matches, and enforcing the rules when we notice low blows.  No, no one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appointed us as the referee, but we're the biggest kid on the block and have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumed the role of shot caller by default.  Maybe its a good thing, maybe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its not.  But it is definitely *not* imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I must respectfully disagree.  Of course, if you insist on a tightly
<BR>
controlled definition of imperialism, then you can dismiss anything that
<BR>
differs, no matter how slightly, from your definition.  Someone once said
<BR>
that you can control a debate by controlling the definitions.  This is what
<BR>
they meant.
<BR>
<P>However,...if you're willing to be a bit looser in your definition of
<BR>
imperialism...
<BR>
<P>The US sends &quot;foreign aid&quot; to lots of countries.  Often this is in the form
<BR>
of a line of credit for american infrastructure builders and armaments
<BR>
manufacturers.  (And you thought it was for food, clothing, medical care,
<BR>
and education.  Yeah, right!) (In the eighties, during a moment of economic
<BR>
tightness, the Washington political insiders found themselves in a bit of a
<BR>
pinch over the issue of foreign aid.  The American people, mostly under the
<BR>
mistaken impression that it was some kind of international charity program,
<BR>
were pressuring the pols for cutbacks.  The pols, however, knew that it was
<BR>
really a way of controlling access to markets and resources, but they
<BR>
couldn't blow the whistle on the Uncle-Sammy-the-sweetheart cover story.
<BR>
Needless to say, the &quot;foreign aid&quot; did not stop.)  The ruling elite in that
<BR>
country then become the client administrators of an informal US territory.
<BR>
If they do not open their markets and make their resources available to
<BR>
American Interests (and why the hell would they want to do that, and throw
<BR>
away everything that they spent an entire political career working to
<BR>
achieve--they're not Fidel Castro for god's sake!), then the foreign aid
<BR>
stops, covert economic (and sometimes military) assistance is provided to
<BR>
their political rivals, and soon, one way or another, US interests have
<BR>
their way.
<BR>
<P>The US elite, with the help of the CIA, dominates the world.
<BR>
<P>It may not be imperialism by some standard definition, but the result is
<BR>
the same.
<BR>
<P>We're all slaves in a big slave world, but Roman slaves have it better than
<BR>
the rest.
