<EM>&gt; Perhaps if we substitute for &quot;imperialism&quot; the word &quot;power&quot; things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be less muddy.  After all, technically there are no &quot;empires&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the world anywhere at this time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  If a real nation-state is one people, one government -- like Ireland,
<BR>
for example -- and an empire is many peoples, one government, specifically
<BR>
with one people ruling all the others, then Indonesia is an empire.  It's a
<BR>
conglomeration of peoples.  In fact, many of the various subgroups want to
<BR>
secede.  Likewise, Iraq is an empire, with conquered Shi'i and Kurd groups
<BR>
as its imperial victims.  The same could be said of the Sudan and Nigeria.
<BR>
China is likewise an empire, with its Tibetan and other Western provinces.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, let's ask the question: can we assign actual centers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power (or control) geographic locations anymore? Does the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power-grid, if any, &quot;float above ground&quot;? Is it an outdated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumption that power centers are governments?  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer to either is &quot;no&quot; then we have to look at how power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IS actually distributed today, and whether the pattern we dis-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cern, if any, is actually significant of anything, or merely an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artifact of history?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think one should ever confuse geography with political power.
<BR>
Granted, Athens was the geographic and political center of the League of
<BR>
Delos (Athens' informal empire at the time) and the city of Rome was
<BR>
likewise the power center of its empire.  However, it was not the
<BR>
geographical location, but the people in charge who mattered.  What
<BR>
mattered, after all, about the Romans as empire-builders was not that they
<BR>
came from Rome or that a tactical nuke could have taken out their capital,
<BR>
but that they could field their legions AND use their allies and enemies to
<BR>
further their plan of empire.  Just taking Rome was no guarantee of success
<BR>
at ruling the Romans -- else no emperor would ever have had to field legions
<BR>
against his competitors.
<BR>
<P>To use another example, the British did occupy the US Capitol during the War
<BR>
of 1812...
<BR>
<P>Of course, now command and control is more mobile and can be distributed
<BR>
more than ever before, but the overall game is still the same.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
