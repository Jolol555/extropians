<P>From: Adam Rifkin -4K &lt;<A HREF="mailto:adam@XeNT.ics.uci.edu?Subject=Re:%20Nasdaq%205000%20just%205%25%20away...&In-Reply-To=&lt;xxx200003020608.WAA07953@XeNT.ics.uci.edu&gt;">adam@XeNT.ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>I occasionally post these when I pop my head up from the gopherhole just
<BR>
to remind myself that
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(1) Everyone still truly believes in the stock market, and therefore
<BR>
&nbsp;(2) The mania will keep on going for the foreseeable future.
<BR>
<P>You had to see the looks on the faces of the thousand attendants of
<BR>
Garage.com's Entrepreneur Boot Camp this week -- they were all
<BR>
singleminded, true believers ready to go out and kill or die for the
<BR>
opportunity to plant their flag in the ground.
<BR>
<P>Garage.com is certainly doing its part: 9500 business plans reviewed
<BR>
last year, 60 plans funded.  After seeing the successes of companies
<BR>
like CMGi and Kleiner Perkins and Softbank and idealab (first wave), and
<BR>
now companies like Garage.com and LoudCloud and ePhibian and eBuilt
<BR>
(second wave), I get the feeling that 10,000 &quot;Vanity Venture Capital
<BR>
Funds&quot; will pop up over the next five years with every decimillionaire
<BR>
and higher contributing funds to kitties to seed all kinds of ideas
<BR>
starting up.  As long as the &quot;virtuous cycle&quot; continues where everyone
<BR>
keeps pumping most of the proceeds back into the system, the system
<BR>
could last for a *very* long time.  After all, tulipmania lasted in
<BR>
Holland for nearly four decades before finally collapsing in 1637.
<BR>
<P>Of course, our stock market is truly nuts.  Stocks regularly double in
<BR>
just a week or two.  (The biotech index alone is up nearly 100% in the
<BR>
past three months, and that's an *index*.)  Sometimes the stocks are
<BR>
legitimate turnaround stories like Information Architects (IARC), which
<BR>
has twenty bagged in about a half a year now that their story is crisper
<BR>
thanks to excellent public relations where there were none before.  I
<BR>
admire that kind of rising-like-the-phoenix.
<BR>
<P>Then there are companies climbing into corporate shells like
<BR>
Xcelera.com, whose Mirror Image technology was recently embraced by
<BR>
George Gilder.  The 52-week low on XLA is less than a dollar.  Today it
<BR>
closed at 352.  That's a five hundred bagger in less than a year, for
<BR>
those keeping track at home.  With a P/E ratio of 3057, it will only
<BR>
take Xcelera three millennia to make its current market cap in profits
<BR>
(roughly $9.3 billion).  Another reverse-merger stock, Sensar (SCII),
<BR>
which I've mentioned here before, is running again on the hype of its
<BR>
Net2Wireless brand name, though sadly it has only fifty-bagged in a
<BR>
year, and its PE is a mere 162, which is less than Cisco's PE of 181.
<BR>
Think about that, it will take almost 200 years of Cisco's current
<BR>
earnings to make its current market cap -- roughly $450 billion.  Cisco
<BR>
is threatening to pass Microsoft's market cap ($473 billion) and become
<BR>
&quot;the most valuable company in the world&quot;, though it's hard to tell which
<BR>
company will be the first to have a market cap of $1 trillion: one of
<BR>
those two, or maybe Nokia, AOL/Time Warner, or perhaps even Worldcom if
<BR>
they buy, say, Mannesman and Akamai.  My bet for the first trillion
<BR>
dollar company is Softbank, which currently is worth $210 billion; if it
<BR>
doubles again, Msr. Son will be worth more on paper than Bill Gates.
<BR>
<P>Spinoffs are getting to the point of insanity.  3Com is raising nearly a
<BR>
billion dollars by spinning off Palm tomorrow -- a company it only
<BR>
ACQUIRED three years ago in the U.S. Robotics merger that tanked its
<BR>
stock.  3Com's stock was selling as low as $20 a share last year but it
<BR>
hit almost $120 a share today on news of this spinoff -- the worst part
<BR>
is, that obnoxious Metcalfe fellow probably still owns shares.  Of
<BR>
course, acquisitions-cum-spinoffs are speeding up nowadays: CMGi bought
<BR>
AltaVista in June for $2.2 billion and is spinning it off for $4 billion
<BR>
sometime in the next month or two.  That's entertainment.  It's getting
<BR>
to the point that a stock that has a bunch of crappy financials spins
<BR>
off the part with the crappy financials (like, say, Sprint PCS),
<BR>
because the companies that do best in a market such as this are the ones
<BR>
with no earnings (they're &quot;investing in growth&quot;).  Last year Hewlett
<BR>
Packard finally got a clue and spun off Agilent, which has since
<BR>
tripled; now Lucent, which ITSELF is a spinoff, finally got a clue and
<BR>
is planning on pulling *its* stock out of the crapper by spinning off
<BR>
its &quot;slower moving division&quot; (see the attachment below).
<BR>
<P>So the bubble could expand for a very long time to come.  Three years,
<BR>
five years, maybe ten years or more.  Retail investors keep buying the
<BR>
dips and wholesale buyers and sellers are making a fortune off the
<BR>
aggregate.  The Nasdaq is within spitting distance of 5000 (see below)
<BR>
-- it's just a matter of time before it passes the Dow at this rate.
<BR>
<P>Garage.com is particularly savvy: collect a thousand bucks from a
<BR>
thousand attendees at a time (though we .edu attendees got away at a
<BR>
mere $300 a pop), get all these popular law and accounting firms to fund
<BR>
the food and tschotsches, bring on all kinds of lawyers and VCs and
<BR>
angels and entrepreneurs to motivate and inspire and encourage with
<BR>
their lectures and panels, and then sit back and take your pick of the
<BR>
best groups to submit their plans to you in search of incubation.
<BR>
Kawasaki is an amazing salesman, and Garage.com like many dot coms is in
<BR>
the business of selling its stock: they recently filed their S-1 and
<BR>
will go public in the spring.  Unfortunately they, like other paper
<BR>
centimillionaires will have to wait until their lockup period ends
<BR>
before they can become liquid and retire.  Fortunately there's lots of
<BR>
work to be done between now and then, because when you're in the
<BR>
business of selling your stock, you gotta ABC: Always Be Closing.
<BR>
<P>And I'm telling you, watching the sheep at Garage.com's Boot Camp,
<BR>
EVERYONE has the bug and everyone has it bad.  Work hard, the theory
<BR>
goes, and you too can get rich quick: it's like everyone has memorized
<BR>
all the words to the movie Wall Street just like the frat boys in the
<BR>
movie Boiler Room sitting in front of their big screen television
<BR>
reciting Michael Douglas' and Charlie Sheen's lines.
<BR>
<P>It's helpful to remember that just in mid October the Nasdaq Composite
<BR>
was around 2600, and now it's almost at 4800.  A hundred newsletters
<BR>
like the one below make the average person think that they too can own a
<BR>
little bit of the entrepreneur's dream if they manage to catch a ride on
<BR>
a hot stock.  Or two.  Or a dozen.  Or more.
<BR>
<P>The inflation in certain stocks in the market seems to dovetail the
<BR>
inflation in certain real estate in the country.  Between their homes,
<BR>
their 401k's, and their portfolios, people *feel* richer.  They really
<BR>
do.  Engineers no longer suffer at startups: in addition to equity they
<BR>
can get six-figure salaries in *cash*.  It really is an unbelievably
<BR>
great time in America to be an entrepreneur -- I'm not sure
<BR>
opportunities like this have ever existed to this extent before.
<BR>
<P>And there's a new upper class rising in society: the technological
<BR>
elite.  It really is shifting the power structure, and you can feel it:
<BR>
lawyers, accountants, bankers, and finance guys know that they can no
<BR>
longer call all of the shots, because the techies now have money and
<BR>
lots of it.  It's like our ultimate revenge for all the years of
<BR>
suffering being a nerd causes to oneself in one's formative years when
<BR>
one's peers are far less accepting of technical savvy.  I wonder what
<BR>
we'll think about the year 2000 in ten or twenty years.  I wonder what
<BR>
seeds for the future are being planted today.  I am *really* curious to
<BR>
know how this will all play out.
<BR>
<P>Who knows.  Sometimes it's best to keep the blinders on.
<BR>
<P>And maybe, just maybe, greed *is* good...

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nasdaq 5,000, More Than Just A Dream
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this point, you almost have to figure traders will want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make a run at the next milestone.  And who can blame them?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This tech-driven market continues to trek higher despite the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dow's lackluster performance.  It is possible that today's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weak performance in the Dow is just more evidence that investors 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are leaving on any rally to head for technology issues.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nasdaq has been filled with opportunities and the outlook is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still bright.  Today was another example of how playable the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nasdaq is too, with an open near 4750 and three intraday bounces 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off that support mark.  You could have stepped into entry points 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at any one of those dips.  This is really becoming a broken 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; record with the Nasdaq dipping to support only to rise once 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again.  The question now is, do we have enough juice to propel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Nasdaq to 5K this week?  Today's close at 4784.32, +87.68 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaves us just under 5% away.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Dow Industrials is another, less enthusiastic, story.  It 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is trying to break a month and a half downtrend.  Today saw a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tight range between 10084 and 10186  We closed the session near 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the middle at 10136.38, +8.07.  The key here is for the Dow to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; close solidly over the 10-dma, currently at 10,206.  This has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been the resistance since mid-January that traders have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selling on.  The old bear trap scenario.  Just when you think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it has the momentum to punch above that moving average, SNAP, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's got you.  I'm still not real keen on this index until we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see one or two day's closing over this mark.  Some are acting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as if this will never happen with the &quot;new economy&quot; taking over.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, it will eventually free itself from this rut, but there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no point testing the waters on some of these between down 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues until it does.  Especially when you can find all the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hot stocks you want in the SOX, Russell 2000 or the previously 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned Nasdaq. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Speaking of the SOX, even after a more than one hundred point 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move on Tuesday, it still managed to gain another 1.72.  This 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sector continues to leave the general market in the dust.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hot sectors of the day included Biotech, Internet, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Networking and Hardware.  Even the Online Brokers put together 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their third straight advance on positive comments about how much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trading we are all doing.  Some analysts are looking for 30-40%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from last quarter in trading activity.    
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The market internals were also good.  Volume was strong at over 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2 billion shares on the Nasdaq and over 1.27 billion on the NYSE.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The advance/decline line was even on the NYSE, while Gainers beat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advancers 24 to 19 on the Nasdaq.  The 30-year bond fell slightly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to yield 6.16 by the close.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The newswires were abuzz with big news from the telecoms today.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was announced that SBC Communications and BellSouth could be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engaged in talks to merge their cellular services.  Shares of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SBC closed up $3.63 at $41.38 and BLS finished the session at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $43, up $2.44.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also in the news today, Lucent announced plans to spin off three 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of it's slower growing businesses including data, cabling, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call-accounting to form one company, which is expected to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available to shareholders in September.  Lucent is taking this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action in order to narrow the focus to the communications 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; networking portion of it's business.  This announcement seemed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to help alleviate some investor concern regarding Lucent's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather slow growth rate.  LU's communications networking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business accounted for roughly $30 billion of Lucent's $38.3 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billion of sales last year.  Wall Street greeted the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announcement with enthusiasm as nearly 75 million shares 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were traded in comparison to the average 18.  Lucent closed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the session up $9.13 at $68.63.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And we are not done with the telecoms just yet.  Shares of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Qwest Communications (Q) were up $11.38 on the news of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible buyout by Germany's Deutsche Telekom.  Qwest spokesman 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matt Barkett, claimed that the reports were nothing but rumors 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and speculation.  Deutsche Telekom offered no comment.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It was another big day for 3Com Corp. (COMS) as investors 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continued to snatch up shares in anticipation of tomorrow's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Palm IPO.  Palm is the number 1 manufacturer of electronic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizers.  The expected offering price for Palm is $38, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has been raised from the original $14 proposed offering 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price.  COMS traded up to another new 52-week high of $119.75 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in today's session.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Shares of Aetna were halted today following the announcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the Health Insurance Giant has received an unsolicited 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offer from WellPoint Health Networks and ING America Insurance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Holdings in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $10 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billion.  Apparently, ING and WellPoint first expressed their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest beginning discussions on the deal in a letter dated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; February 24th.  Aetna commented that they will be reviewing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the offer.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The future of this market still sounds like a broken record.   
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Nasdaq is where the action is at for those looking to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long the market.  The Dow has provided as much volatility of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; late, but the trend is still lower, although may be coming to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an end.  A nice retest of last week's lows followed by a bounce 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which can close above the 10-dma might be just what the Dow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs.  Hopefully it can curb this downtrend without another 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; panic event to the downside.  But if it does cause investors 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sell and pull down the other markets like the Nasdaq, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be hunting for entry points.  Earnings season just isn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that far off anymore.  Dips in the Biotech, Semis, and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old reliable Internets (still sounds strange) is where I will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be focusing my efforts.

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lucent Rises from the Ashes on Spin-Off Plans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By Cindy Christ
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lucent Technologies rose from the dead Wednesday, but some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analysts were warning that its meteoric rise could be short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lived.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lucent (LU) plunged 23 percent Jan. 7 after the world's No. 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telecommunications equipment maker warned that its profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would fall below expectations by up to 25 percent, in part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it couldn't meet demand for optical networking and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other fiber optic products.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On Wednesday, Lucent breathed new life into its stagnant share
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price by announcing it would spin off slower expanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divisions into an independent company to focus on the fastest-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; growing areas of its business.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Shares of Lucent, the most widely held U.S. stock, were up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $12.50, or 21 percent, at $72 midday and were the Big Board's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most active issue with 61 million shares trading hands.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Intraday, Lucent traded as high as $75.38.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lucent said the new company, which is as yet unnamed, will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concentrate on enterprise networking products and services,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including telephone switchboards, cabling systems and data-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based Local Area Networks.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lucent said the new $8 billion company would rank No. 1 or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. 2 in most of the markets in which it competes, starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out with a blue-chip customer list including 90 percent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fortune 500 companies and 34,000 employees worldwide.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Under the spin-off, which is expected to close by Sept. 30,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shares in the new company will be distributed tax free to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lucent shareowners.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;By spinning off our PBS, SYSTIMAX cabling and LAN-based data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; businesses, we are sharpening Lucent's focus and creating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another leading company to serve business customers,&quot; said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lucent Technologies chairman and CEO Richard McGinn in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Lucent will concentrate greater resources on fast-growing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; areas like optical networking, Internet infrastructure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wireless, semiconductors, optoelectronics, Web-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enterprise solutions linking private to public networks, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional design and consulting services for service
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providers and enterprises,&quot; he added.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; McGinn said that current Lucent executive vice president and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chief financial officer Donald Peterson has been named
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; president and CEO of the new company.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Before coming to Lucent, Peterson ran the enterprise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; networking business for Canada's Nortel Networks (NT).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After the spin-off, each company will have its own brand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board of directors and research and development organizations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent will have about 116,000 workers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worldwide and 1999 sales of $30 billion.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In recent months Lucent also has been considering a tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock for its optical networking unit. Market watchers say a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision could come by the end of this quarter.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Initial reaction to the spin-off on Wall Street was mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive, but late in the session a leading investment bank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was alerting investors that concerns about Lucent's upcoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quarter could pop Wednesday's bubble.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; SG Cowen analyst Christopher Stix raised his rating Wednesday
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Lucent shares to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;The spin-off will help increase the growth profile of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company and improve operating margins,&quot; said Stix.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Analysts said that while margins would increase, the spin-off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't affect Lucent's earnings.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; According to CNBC financial television, Goldman Sachs issued a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warning to clients Wednesday, saying that Lucent's March
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quarter is at risk and that earnings projections may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lowered from current levels.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unlike chief rival Nortel Networks, Lucent has struggled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to transition its business from providing equipment for voice-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based communications systems to meet exploding demand for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-speed Internet and data networking gear.

<P><EM>&gt; Latest Write Up
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While we might loudly complain that volume fell off a cliff 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the price didn't move relative the rest of the tech issues 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the last two trading days, that could actually be a blessing.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The low volume of roughly half the ADV of 1.4 mln shares says 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that traders are not interested in dumping VERT shares either 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we may have found a higher low following the solid bounce 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off previous long-term support of $200.  It now appears support 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is holding well at $215-$216.  Use that as your target for what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will likely be the best entry.  If you'd rather see a breakout 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before taking a position, then $225 backed up with an increase 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in volume is your number.  Still helping to drive this play 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going forward will be the 2:1 split, which will take effect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after the close on March 31.  You still have plenty of time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a good entry, so wait for VERT to come to you.  With the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest of the market moving forward though, the probability of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VERT remaining at these levels for long diminishes.  Earnings 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not a factor again until May.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Comments
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, if you were waiting for that breakout mentioned above, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today was your day.  VERT posted an impressive $9.63 gain and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had some nice volume backing the move.  As we mentioned, there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is still plenty of time to get on board for the split run, so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do not be hasty with your entry points.  Watch for the $225 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level to continue to hold.  VERT looks to have additional 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support between $214 and $216, which could hold on a pullback 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and provide some nice possible points of entry.  VERT may 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encounter a bit of immediate resistance at $230, so watch for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VERT to move through this level.

<P><EM>&gt; CLRS - Clarus $115.50   *** B2B Sector Sizzles ***
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Clarus develops, markets and supports Web-based electronic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commerce applications and client/server financial and human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources applications.  Clarus' applications enable organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to gain control of their operational resources and reduce the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total cost of ownership by minimizing the time, costs, and risks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associated with implementing, changing, and upgrading the appli-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cations. Almost all of its products are sold as application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suites.  Clarus' Commerce line of products leverages Web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology to connect large populations of employees, management,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and suppliers in continuous planning, monitoring, and control of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources. The Clarus line of products are based on a flexible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open architecture called Active Architecture, which allows for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seamless, rapid changes and upgrades without modifying the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Though Clarus posted a fourth quarter loss ($0.47), they beat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimates by 13 cents. The company also reported record revenues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing 170 percent while their E-commerce license fees were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up 200 percent.  The resulting coverage by JC Bradford and Salomon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Smith Barney (JC Bradford quickly upgraded to a &quot;strong buy&quot;), 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused an immediate reverse in the post-earnings drop. Several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new agreements have also helped ignite the new uptrend, with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the latest, a broad-based agreement Wachovia.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The technical pattern is quite favorable with the support provided
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the January and mid-February high offering a reasonable entry

<EM>&gt; (mitoxantrone for injection concentrate).  Now the big news is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the announced 3-for-1 split of its common shares in the form of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock dividend. The record date of this stock split is March 6.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The split should occur around March 20, while the March option
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expiration is Friday, March 17.  With momentum players jumping on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every stock split, it is no wonder that Credit Suisse First Boston,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raised its price target for Immunex to $300 a share. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The move Wednesday was strong though there should be time to grab
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some naked put option premium.  The chart remains extremely bullish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as Immunex has broken out into blue sky territory.  Any pullback 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the next few days should inflate the conservative positions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listed below.

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commerce infrastructure services to the off-line world through 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regional Bell Operating Companies, merchant banks and other local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media networks.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any name change that gets you into blue sky territory is fine by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this writer.  Infospace didn't even blink after its split in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; January, as its price continued to climb up strongly, never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violating its 13 dma.  The move today was supported by strong 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volume and the consolidation area around $190 should provide some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near term support.
