<BR>
<EM>&gt;For all effective reasons, I am the child of the 90's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Could you elaborate on those?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi Sasha,
<BR>
<P>I thought you referred to public demonstrations, performance art, protests, and
<BR>
that sort of thing. Not much of that goes on in the 90s (unlike the 60s). Except
<BR>
for the WTO stuff last year (last millennium), and some skirmishes in Chico,
<BR>
California before that, I haven't heard of much along those lines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, some groups will profit from that, let them run it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I thought I'd just inspire somebody.
</EM><BR>
<P>You do inspire. I appreciate your work, and I enjoy your web site. Thank you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You have any statistics?  Raves are fun, except that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are mostly young kids there.  I love their company, but could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use more; besides, playing with kids at times brings too much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trouble, especially with the conservative parents and authorities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the presence of the repressive government spoils much of the fun.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, mostly kids rave. Haven't gone to one myself. Kids don't like me much.
<BR>
Good. Keeps 'em outta my way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are so many conservative groups around who impose their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idiotic rules that they consider natural but they are so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illogical that one can't even guess what may upset them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I experienced that first hand recently. A conservative neighbor said I
<BR>
&quot;insulted&quot; him, and kicked me with his booted foot as hard as he could. I didn't
<BR>
see it coming. Asked him why he did it, and all he just shouted &quot;You don't know?
<BR>
You don't know?&quot; When I finally got him out of the house (yes he did it in my
<BR>
house), I felt very relieved. He has never apologized, and I no longer
<BR>
communicate with him.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And they want to hurt you for any sign of deviation from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;picked-out-of-the-ass behavioral norms.
</EM><BR>
<P>You got that right. I think their power trip control freak behavior constitutes
<BR>
mental illness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Big and increasing annoyance in my life recently, as I am getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personally more and more liberated, while in the eyes of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging mundane &quot;peers&quot; I should be behaving more and more like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a stable middle-aged professional, with respect to religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;values, authorities, mundane life experiences, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Done any LSD lately?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Can't live with mundanes, can't help them (you help one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become half-free, the others want to kill you, you help another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in something else - the first one joins the persecution), can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kill them, can't escape from them.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Can't live with 'em... Pass the beer nuts.&quot;
<BR>
--Norm, on Cheers
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Any options that I missed?
</EM><BR>
<P>You forgot the neo-socialist collectivist Borg hide-bound herd mentality elites
<BR>
who think they can solve the world's problems by making everyone equal (except
<BR>
for themselves, of course, who must direct everything).
