<P>
I haven't read the paper, but my interpretation of the abstract is that
<BR>
instead of just extrapolating average lifespans, they looked at the
<BR>
mortality rate at each age and extrapolated that.  So they looked at
<BR>
the mortality rate for, say 70 year olds (i.e. how many 70 year olds
<BR>
die in a year) for 1950, 1960, 1970, and so on, and extrapolated into
<BR>
the 21st century.  They do this for each age bracket.
<BR>
<P>The result is an extrapolated mortality profile for any year in the
<BR>
future.  They can then use this to calculate the &quot;expected lifetime&quot; using
<BR>
the convention of applying the mortality rates associated with that year.
<BR>
<P>Apparently this technique produces a smaller expected lifespan than just
<BR>
extrapolating average lifespans themselves, but has less uncertainty.
<BR>
They also noted that their predictions are for larger lifetimes than
<BR>
the official government predictions, but it's not clear what method the
<BR>
government uses.
<BR>
<P>Their result of a 10 year increase over 70 some years sounds pretty low.
<BR>
I posted some of the historical data a few weeks ago showing about .1 to
<BR>
.3 years of lifespan improvement per year, and their results would be at
<BR>
the low end of that range.  And of course if we see some technological
<BR>
revolutions that completely change our understanding of aging, things
<BR>
could change dramatically.
<BR>
<P>One thing they could do with this technique (it's not clear if they are
<BR>
doing this) is to extrapolate the mortality rates forward and answer
<BR>
the question, what is the expected lifetime of a person who is X years
<BR>
old today?  They would use the mortality for X-year-olds in 2000, for
<BR>
(X+10)-year-olds in 2010, for (X+20)-year-olds in 2020, and so on.
<BR>
This would be a more meaningful number in terms of an actual prediction
<BR>
for how long people can expect to live, again assuming steady growth.
