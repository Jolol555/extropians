<P><EM>&gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people promoting

<EM>&gt; the terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despite the believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; due to it's diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well the question is whether or not there is enough gas &quot;frozen&quot; or
<BR>
locked up in minerals that can be freed to produce a usable atmosphere.
<BR>
In the Mars case, I believe UV photodissociation causes the Hydrogen to
<BR>
get lost to space (thats why Ozone is good).  But you would have to
<BR>
do some careful calculations to see what the loss rates are for N2,
<BR>
O2, CO2, Ar, etc.  Lots of stuff will react with the metals and get
<BR>
sequestered.  More will freeze out if the planet is cold (accelerating
<BR>
anti-greenhouse if you can produce dry ice).
<BR>
<P>Planetary engineering is no easy task.  I think the general &quot;impression&quot;
<BR>
is that if they can generate enough gas to make an atmosphere, they
<BR>
will figure out how to hold onto it after the fact.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Don't get me wrong I want us to go there and I feel we could live there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you want to live at the bottom of a gravity well?!?
<BR>
And do you have a defense against descending nanobots hell-bent
<BR>
on dismantling your planet and using it for computronium???
<BR>
Actually though, once Mercury &amp; Venus are harvested, you probably
<BR>
want to just sift through Mars, pull out the Carbon and Silicon and
<BR>
leave behind a cold hard hunk of rusty iron...  Hope you enjoy your new home.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe, though, we can only live there under a man made roof to hold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the atmosphere.
</EM><BR>
<P>*&quot;We&quot;*, thou doth invokest the global &quot;we&quot;, seeming to imply that
<BR>
I seekest to live on that cold dry windy planet with you!?!
<BR>
I would sooner drink rhubarb wine than live beside a neighbor
<BR>
whose thoughts seem to run no deeper than the water running down
<BR>
my windows (I'm in Seattle remember)...
<BR>
<P>Seriously (Oh, Oh, how I hate to do that....), this is discussed in
<BR>
papers regarding uses of Nanotechnology for Terraforming.
<BR>
See: &quot;Terraforming with Nanotechnology&quot;, Journal of the
<BR>
British Interplanetary Society, V. 47:311-318 (1994).
<BR>
<P>Headlines read: &quot;Nanobot Wars On Mars... As one group of nanobots
<BR>
attempts to seal in the newly created atmosphere, another group
<BR>
of nanobots keeps launching high speed ingots of Silicon Carbide
<BR>
that keep punching holes in the atmospheric sealant canopy.
<BR>
Mars Direct stock fell 14% on rumors that the judges in the
<BR>
Solar System courts are being replaced by Computronium4Us
<BR>
AI-judges designed with a concept of self-interest.  Sources
<BR>
who declined to be named indicated that this seemed to be bad
<BR>
news for Mars Direct who had hoped to retain Mars material in order
<BR>
to support a luddite retirement community.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I asked R. Zubrin this question. All he said was go read his book.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really, really doubt Zubrin understands the implications of nanotech.
