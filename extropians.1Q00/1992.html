Hello all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art Kaplan, a nationally known Bioethicist whose future predictions for 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
new millenium were mentioned in the Transhumanist Times, and James Wilson 
<BR>
will be giving a talk called &quot;Will the Re-engineering of Human Beings 
<BR>
Re-engineer 
<BR>
Human Nature?&quot; on Tuesday, February 8th, 5-6:30pm at Logan Hall, University 
<BR>
of Pennsylvania, 249 S. 36th Street.  Transhuman Philadelphia will be 
<BR>
arranging 
<BR>
to meet there as a group to attend the talk.  If you will be able to come, 
<BR>
please 
<BR>
let me know at Delvieron@AOL.com.  I will be trying to get more information 
<BR>
on 
<BR>
the talk today (including verifying the times).  You can also call for more 
<BR>
information (215) 898-8220.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not try going to the Transhuman Philadelphia site today for 
<BR>
more 
<BR>
information as it seems there is a problem with our host server.  Check back 
<BR>
tomorrow, though, and hopefully everything will be back to normal.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a quick reminder that our own Transhuman Philadelphia monthly 
<BR>
meeting is this Saturday, February 5th (Chinese New Year) 1PM at the 
<BR>
HK Golden Phoenix Chinese restaurant on 911 Race Street in Philadelphia's 
<BR>
own Chinatown.  And for those who would be interested, there is also just 
<BR>
blocks away the 2000 Philadelphia Auto Show, which opens its doors at 10 am 
<BR>
and stays open til 6 pm.  If anyone would be interested in going to the auto 
<BR>
show before the meeting begins or after it ends (assuming we ever do&lt;g&gt;), 
<BR>
again please let me know at Delvieron@AOL.com.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks again for your time, and hope to see you all there.
<BR>
<P>Glen Finney
