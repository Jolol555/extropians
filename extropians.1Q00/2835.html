<P><P><EM>&gt; I had a thought once. What if two black holes began ever so slowly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to collide.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Two black holes would not necessaarily collide 'slowly', since the
<BR>
gravitational field near the event horizon is very strong and they would
<BR>
therefore be accelerating towards one another.  Most likely they would
<BR>
have built up considerable speed by they time they drew close enough to
<BR>
each other for their event horizons to touch.  But the actual rate of
<BR>
acceleration would depend on the mass of the black holes - the larger the
<BR>
masses of the two black holes may be, the smaller the acceleration at the
<BR>
time when the horizons touch, because of inertia.  If two very large
<BR>
black holes could somehow be placed right next to one another, with zero
<BR>
relative initial velocity, then they would appear to collide slowly, as
<BR>
they began to merge.  Smaller black holes would merge more rapidly than
<BR>
larger ones, as the gravitational force is larger at the event horizon of
<BR>
a small black hole than it is at the horizon of a large black hole.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; What effect might one observe as the two event horizons just touch? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assume the mass of both for sake of argument is exactly equal. Would
</EM><BR>
particles 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be pulled in two? This would be difficult for plank sized items, no?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>The tidal force at the event horizon is typically very strong, but its
<BR>
strength depends completely on the size of the black hole (it's stronger
<BR>
for smaller black holes).  A formerly compact material object would be
<BR>
stretched out like a thin strand of spaghetti and most likely would be
<BR>
pulled apart into small pieces, somewhat like what happened to the comet
<BR>
which collided with Jupiter a few years ago.  My guess is that the tidal
<BR>
force at the event horizon of a typical black hole would be nowhere near
<BR>
strong enough to pull apart an elementary particle such as proton. 
<BR>
Smaller black holes have a stronger tidal force at the event horizon than
<BR>
larger black holes, due to the laws of physics which describe tidal
<BR>
forces.  Inside a black hole, near the singularity, there is no limit on
<BR>
how great the tidal force may be, assuming that the singularity is
<BR>
infinitely small and has a finite mass, and that the classical law of
<BR>
gravity applies.
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;Or would 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fall to one side or the other of the resultant hump left in space 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between the two dents made in space time? What would determine to which
</EM><BR>
side a 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; particle falls? Perhaps this is a foolish thought after all I'm not an
</EM><BR>
expert 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; just an inquiring mind. Still though, any thoughts?

<P><P>Just as water runs downhill, a particle would fall into whichever black
<BR>
hole pulls more strongly on the particle.
