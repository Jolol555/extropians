His roommate walked into the room and saw the from line and said &quot;you know 
<BR>
someone named Zeb Hard on?&quot;. When I look up my name in altavista (to see if 
<BR>
pages have been indexed), their spell check asks me &quot;maybe you meant 
<BR>
hard-on?&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I laughed out loud when I read this!  You poor guy!  It is pretty funny 
<BR>
though.  I wanted to write as my subject header, &quot;Zeb Haradon, porn star!&quot;  
<BR>
In your case, unlike fictional George Constanza, the software was picking on 
<BR>
you and it was not something you chose for yourself!
