<P>
<EM>&gt;The more people react to this, the better. Atheists, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all people, should be open to transhumanistic ideas, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these irrational deathist memes are holding them back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps repeated exposure to positive anti-memes can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get at least some of them on the right track.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This was my submission:
<BR>
<P>I was excited when I saw the title of the article &quot;Death Is Not an Event
<BR>
in Life&quot; By James Still because it seemed to mirror my own thoughts on
<BR>
the subject.
<BR>
<P>I became disappointed as I read however.  Indeed, death need not be an
<BR>
event in any life, other than a temporary one.  James paints a picture
<BR>
of a great man, but to assuage his sorrow at the loss of his father, he
<BR>
accepts death as a necessary part of life.
<BR>
<P>How much better if his father could have been cryogenically frozen, to
<BR>
be revived when technology makes it possible to repair both the damage
<BR>
due to freezing and that caused by his stroke.
<BR>
<P>His &quot;examined life&quot; of quality could have continued and his wisdom
<BR>
grown.
<BR>
<P>We are so close to defeating death... it is possible that many now alive
<BR>
will never die.  How sad it is to miss such a great adventure by mere
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P>Is cryonic resuscitation currently possible?  No, it isn't.  But that in
<BR>
no way means that it won't be in the future.  Consider it a last,
<BR>
desperate gamble, an extreme last ditch medical effort.  You could lose
<BR>
the bet... but that just means you remain dead.  
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, you could win.
<BR>
