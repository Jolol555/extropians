<P><EM>&gt; There have been a couple of mentions recently of antiangiogenesis drugs.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After the big splash a couple of years ago, things have been quiet during the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard work of clinical trials.  Any word from the front on how those trials 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are going?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The primary scientist behind these (whose name I do not have unfortunately)
<BR>
gave a presentation on these when he won the Infinity Award at the Dec.
<BR>
A4M conference.  There are more than a dozen of these in clinical
<BR>
trials from most of the major pharma companies and several of them
<BR>
are doing quite well.  The slides he showed from his work were simply
<BR>
amazing (large tumor regressions).
<BR>
<P>He explained how there was a problem initially (which is why they
<BR>
went through a boom &amp; bust cycle), that other labs had trouble
<BR>
reproducing their results.  That turned out to be a problem that
<BR>
when they were shipping the protein out of their lab in standard
<BR>
plastic tubes, CO2 could get into the tube, cause acidification
<BR>
of the solution and deactivation of the protein.  Those problems
<BR>
have subsequently been solved.  I believe that there have been
<BR>
several papers in the major journals (Science, Cell, ???) on
<BR>
these regarding the work his lab had done.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly enough, there are hints that if the cancer cells
<BR>
are subjected to several cycles of AIs (shrink, allow to grow,
<BR>
shrink, grow, etc.) that they may eliminate the micro-tumors
<BR>
entirely.  Perhaps this is due to sensitizing the immune system
<BR>
for the cancer cells when they go in to clean up the remains
<BR>
of the cells that die off due to insufficient nutrients.  Alot
<BR>
more study needs to be done and characterization of which
<BR>
AIs inhibit which cancers (since there seems to be a family
<BR>
of receptors and inhibitors involved).
