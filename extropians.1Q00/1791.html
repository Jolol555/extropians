I looked over that site a few weeks ago.  They had a paper which resolved
<BR>
an apparent paradox.  The paradox was that it appeared that a certain
<BR>
cyclic engine would extract energy from the zero point fluctuations,
<BR>
and would be a perpetual motion machine.  The solution was that the
<BR>
assumptions in the engine analysis were invalid, the energy levels were
<BR>
not what had been assumed, and the engine wouldn't work.
<BR>
<P>Given this, why go on with the research?  Well, it would be interesting if
<BR>
they can actually measure some results and verify that their calculations
<BR>
are correct.  But I seemed to detect a whiff of hope that maybe they
<BR>
would find a slightly different engine and this would would be a true
<BR>
perpetual motion machine.  I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that
<BR>
one to work out!  I hope they don't push this angle too hard; it's pretty
<BR>
questionable IMO to lead people on with the hope of this outcome.
