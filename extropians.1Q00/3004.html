<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people promoting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place due to it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, here goes my tri-monthly de-lurk...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In Greg Egan's &quot;Diaspora&quot;, a group of post singularity aliens accomplished this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (weighing an atmosphere down) by inserting extra neutrons into the nuclei of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything on the planet. One of the characters described it as &quot;... they inserted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the changes at the lowest level, beneath the ecosystem.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would this actually work? In other words, would Terran biochemistry (as distinguished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from any other kind, 'natch :)) continue to work if everything was the next stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isotope up?
</EM><BR>
<P>Key word: stable.  Digging out the CRC handbook, I look at major
<BR>
constituents of the atmosphere and lithosphere:
<BR>
<P>Element     Common  Heaviest
<BR>
Nitrogen    14      15
<BR>
Oxygen      16      18
<BR>
Magnesium   24.3    26     Natural Mg is a blend of 24, 25, 26
<BR>
Aluminum    27      27     No heavy, stable isotopes
<BR>
Silicon     28.1    30     Natural Si is a blend of 28, 29, 30
<BR>
Calcium     40.1    48
<BR>
Iron        55.9    58
<BR>
<P>Just at a glance, it appears that this method would only add maybe 5% to
<BR>
the mass of a planet- a lot easier just to put a lid on the atmosphere!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; More to the point, can _unmodified_ humans breathe a heavy oxygen/heavy nitrogen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere without developing lung cancer, or asphyxiation, or similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unpleasantness?
</EM><BR>
<P>Heavy water produces small but measurable effects in animal experiments;
<BR>
foraminifera shift the O16:O18 ratio in their shells when the water temp
<BR>
shifts (probably due to diffusion effects, not any adaptive trait). 
<BR>
Diffusion rates might change a bit, but the creature's overall health
<BR>
shouldn't be affected.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Furthermore, what would this do the the half-life of the atmosphere? My knowledge of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gas behavior (does this fall under chemistry, physics, or celestial mechanics? ) is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little weak (CS degree). Actually, it consists almost entirely of what I've learned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here. Say for example in the simple case, where each particle in the atmosphere is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twice as heavy as it was before. How does this affect atmospheric dissipation rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; due to Brownian motion and/or insufficient gravity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a first approximation, a particle at the top of the atmosphere will dissipate if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it exceeds the escape velocity of the planet at that altitude. The average velocity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of all the particles in the atmosphere is simply another way of expressing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature of the atmosphere. Conclusion number one: if the atmosphere was all heavy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atoms, the particles would move less for the same energy input, and would therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be colder. (unless I'm wrongly conflating the vibration identified as heat with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vibration identified as Browning motion. Anybody feel free to jump in :))
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, you've conflated the names, but the physics is accurate enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So if the rate of dissipation of the atmosphere is proportional to the temperature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the atmosphere, then doubling the mass of the particles should roughly double the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere's half-life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd have to go through the complete derivation again to be sure- I think
<BR>
there may be a square root or x^2 factor in there, since velocity is
<BR>
proportional to the -0.5 power of molecular weight.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Anybody feel free to tighten this up somewhat?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, I have to get some real work done- I'll pass.
<BR>
