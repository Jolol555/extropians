<P>
Extropy Institute announces the opening of the Transhumanist Times: 
<BR>
Extropic News and Views. You can find the new publication at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.transhumanisttimes.com">http://www.transhumanisttimes.com</A>
<BR>
<P>The Transhumanist Times aims to serve as a news service for transhumanists. 
<BR>
We will gather news on all topics of transhumanist interest, filtering out 
<BR>
the few important gems from the vast piles of news nuggets every day. Some 
<BR>
items will consist simply of headlines, a couple of lines of description, 
<BR>
and a hyperlink to another site. Other items will include interpretation 
<BR>
and commentary by one of the TT's Correspondents or by ad hoc contributors. 
<BR>
The Times will also carry feature pieces, mainly geared towards analysis of 
<BR>
current events or debates on current issues.
<BR>
<P>The Transhumanist Times is for all of us, and everyone can contribute to 
<BR>
it. While we have a few initial Correspondents who will look for news in 
<BR>
their area of interest, every transhumanist should feel free to send in 
<BR>
items for publication. We will start off modestly, but hope that--with your 
<BR>
participation--this news and information service can become a vital and 
<BR>
frequently updated site.
<BR>
<P>After checking the site, it all seems to be working fine, but I've been 
<BR>
told that if you're using Netscape Navigator rather than Internet Explorer, 
<BR>
the pages may be too wide. I'm not sure why this happens, and would 
<BR>
appreciate any help with this.
<BR>
<P>I would like to thank the initial contributors. Above all, my thanks to 
<BR>
Natasha Vita-More. Natasha was the catalyst that took my dormant idea 
<BR>
(originally a grander but less realistic project) and spurred it into 
<BR>
action. We worked together closely to create the site, with Natasha of 
<BR>
course being the Design Director as well as Associate Editor.
<BR>
<P>Right after posting this message, I will be leaving for a day and a half in 
<BR>
Texas, so will not be able to reply until late Wednesday morning.
<BR>
<P>Please visit www.transhumanisttimes.com and look around, give us some 
<BR>
feedback, and please consider contributing material.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
