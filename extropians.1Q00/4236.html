Perhaps call to order driverless vehicles that come to your door step, 
<BR>
travel a ways and join up with a mass of others going the same direction, 
<BR>
then branch off to your destination where other passengers take that same 
<BR>
vehicle to yet another destination.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Considering how Americans love to control(drive) their own vehicles, this 
<BR>
may be a very hard thing to get them to do!! lol  In areas like L.A. where 
<BR>
gridlock is bad I could see the public in frustration possibly going for it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moller skycar would take control from the passenger and this could be 
<BR>
a &quot;roadblock&quot; to the public eagerly accepting it.
<BR>
<P>James, the scenario you gave of skycars crashing into people on the ground 
<BR>
is frightening and yet each year in the U.S. about fifty-thousand people die 
<BR>
in car accidents!  And a large percentage involving the abuse of drugs and 
<BR>
alcohol.  I see skycars being safer then that!  Especially with automatic 
<BR>
controls guided by gps.
<BR>
<P>I have a friend here in Anchorage who is a pilot of many years experience 
<BR>
and he also has serious reservations about the moller skycar similar to your 
<BR>
own.  He basically thought they were cool looking deathtraps! lol
<BR>
<P>Certainly, there would have to be serious changes in the nature of air 
<BR>
traffic and it's monitoring to make things safe.  It may be a number of 
<BR>
decades till we see skycars constantly zooming overhead.
<BR>
<P>I have read that Dr. Moller is going to do serious flight trials this year.  
<BR>
I look forward to hearing how they go.  When Nasa, the military and the FBI, 
<BR>
etc, start using moller skycars I will know that it is just a matter of time 
<BR>
till the public gets them.
<BR>
<P>Like with cryonics, despite any bad news I am an optimist and want to try 
<BR>
the technology out when it is the right time for me and the kinks have been 
<BR>
worked out.  And just think, with our skycars it won't be such a big deal 
<BR>
going to an extro!  As long as you're an American citizen, of course(yes, 
<BR>
Charlie Stross! lol).
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
