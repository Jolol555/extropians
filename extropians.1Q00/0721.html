<EM>&gt; The interesting question is whether the benefits come from &quot;disciplined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practices&quot; that are incompatible with open source (why can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open-sourcers be &quot;disciplined&quot;?), or the engineering CASE tools that go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along with being the sort of company that engages in disciplined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practices.
</EM><BR>
<P>The evidence is already in on this one.  Other things being equal, simply
<BR>
adopting CASE tools can be expected to yield only a modest improvement in
<BR>
productivity.  You might get a factor of two or three if your tool is
<BR>
especially well suited to the work you do, but most companies see much
<BR>
smaller effects.  It is not at all uncommon for productivity to actually
<BR>
decline after CASE tools are adopted, and the same is true for just about
<BR>
any other technological fix.
<BR>
<P>Efficient software creation requires an organization to have a methodical,
<BR>
long-term effort to improve the way it creates programs.  This includes
<BR>
systematic testing and defect tracking, standardized coding practices,
<BR>
quantitative estimation methods, risk management, change management, and
<BR>
professional project management.  It means you have long-term in-house
<BR>
efforts to find better ways of organizing your development teams, to write
<BR>
custom software that supports your development process, and to find and
<BR>
eliminate sources of defects in your software.  Finally, if you want the
<BR>
effort to succeed it means having a stable group of staff members who can
<BR>
accumulate a lasting body of knowledge about your development process.
<BR>
<P>Now, the reason why I don't think open source development can effectively
<BR>
use this approach has nothing to do with the character of the developers
<BR>
involved (though I will note, in passing, that IMHO open source enthusiasts
<BR>
tend to be very hostile to the idea of any kind of centralized management of
<BR>
the development process).  The problem is that each developer can only
<BR>
organize his own efforts, and the supervisory group has neither the
<BR>
resources nor the ability to impose much order on the resulting chaos.  Why
<BR>
not?  Because (limited funding) x (more people working fewer hours each) x
<BR>
(no financial stake for the developers) x (no means of enforcing decisions)
<BR>
x (little or no personal contact between anyone involved) inevitable yields
<BR>
a huge increase in the effort required to exert any control at all over the
<BR>
development process.
<BR>
<P>Consequently, I expect that open source efforts will be limited to the few
<BR>
process improvements that can be implemented by automated systems (i.e.
<BR>
version control, elementary bug tracking).  Meanwhile, conventional
<BR>
organizations can pursue a program of substantial progressive improvements
<BR>
that (at least so far) has no known upper limit.

<BR>
<P><P>P.S.  I'm sure most of us are aware that software development becomes
<BR>
progressively less and less efficient as the size of a project increases.
<BR>
Large organizations therefore estimate the effort required for a given
<BR>
project with formulae like:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effort = X * KLOC^Y
<BR>
<P>Where X and Y are derived from performance data for similar projects in the
<BR>
past.  Y is typically around 1.15 for large organizations which do this sort
<BR>
of record keeping, so you can see that programming effort per KLOC becomes
<BR>
prohibitive beyond a certain point.  It is therefore encouraging to note
<BR>
that NASA's SEL (Software Engineering Laboratory) has recently achieved
<BR>
Y=0.986.
