Hello everyone,

I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman Show.  
<BR>
Incredible movie. I think the idea of someone suddenly seeing that the world 
<BR>
was not as it appeared to be is quite relevant to us as 
<BR>
extropians/cryonicists/transhumans. When Truman came up against the wall at 
<BR>
the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death, 
<BR>
although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so 
<BR>
inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.  I recall that there was quite 
<BR>
a bit of discussion about The Truman Show on this list. Is there any way to 
<BR>
search the Extro list archives and read those messages? When I asked a 
<BR>
couple of other people who saw the movie, they thought it was a &quot;good 
<BR>
movie,&quot; and that was about it. Are we weird, or what?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I suppose we are a slightly wierd bunch! lol  I found that with the film 
<BR>
&quot;Matrix&quot; the public got the point so many missed with &quot;Truman Show.&quot;  I 
<BR>
remember my younger brother (who I gave a copy of &quot;Great Mambo Chicken&quot; to 
<BR>
for Christmas)  talking about how a person could enjoy &quot;Matrix&quot; on two 
<BR>
different levels.

<EM>&gt;I can relate to that too. Very often when people bring up the topic &gt;of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death, I will inevitably mention that death &quot;may&quot; not be &gt;inevitable. When 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I try to explain that it is really just a problem &gt;with biology and it can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be corrected, I usually get a look as if I &gt;just tore off my face and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revealed some terrifying Sci Fi creature.
</EM><BR>
<P>I usually keep the fact that I am a terrifying Sci Fi creature to myself! :) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives of this planet are easily frightened and that can turn to 
<BR>
revulsion and angry mobs wielding torches.  Ironically, most people I talk 
<BR>
to about this subject claim they don't want to live that much longer, they 
<BR>
just don't want to grow old.  Something along the lines of the people in 
<BR>
&quot;Brave New World.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I never understood why this should come as a shock to people these &gt;days. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a species human kind has been searching for the answer to &gt;immortality 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the moment we realized that we are alive.
</EM><BR>
<P>And now we are on the verge, relatively speaking!  I remember in a history 
<BR>
of China class where we learned of an emperor who in vain tried to have his 
<BR>
learned men discover immortality for him.  They finally duped him by giving 
<BR>
him a daily tablet of substances that we know now actually shortened his 
<BR>
life.  Health scams go back a long time, obviously!
<BR>
<P>We are a very fortunate generation.  Many have dreamed in vain to be where 
<BR>
we are.  But as Max More said awhile back he realizes he may not make it.  
<BR>
We may have all been born too early to take full advantage of the life 
<BR>
extension techniques that will be developed when we are old men and women.  
<BR>
They may still help us but not to the extent of a twenty year-old in the 
<BR>
year 2040 who will be young enough to take full advantage of these 
<BR>
technologies and will have enough years ahead of him to win the waiting game 
<BR>
in the search for real emortality.
<BR>
<P>I believe cryonics is the way for us but as most know this is hardly a sure 
<BR>
thing.  Sadly, even though there is the money within the 
<BR>
cryonics/transhumanist community to fund the research needed to perfect 
<BR>
methods, it has not been forthcoming.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We have been searching for answers and now we are coming up with &gt;answers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that don't involve having to die to get there. Seems to me &gt;that there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be less &quot;faith&quot; involved in physical immortality &gt;than the leap of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;faith or gamble that there may be a spiritual after &gt;life involving a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transference into another dimension, an alternate &gt;reality or even an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unseen UFO in the tail of a comet. To me these &gt;are no longer valid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;options.
</EM><BR>
<P>The faith comes in the form of you hoping that within your lifetime the 
<BR>
scientific advances will come to save you from death.  Many do see religion 
<BR>
as a very valid option.  I am fascinated by near-death experiences and have 
<BR>
read many books on the subject.  I realize that brain hallucinations caused 
<BR>
by a dying brain are one explanation but I think there may be more to it 
<BR>
then that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then there is the old why would anyone want to live forever refrain. &gt;If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone truly does not care if they die than they are not really &gt;living to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;begin with. Ask the same person if they would be willing &gt;to die tomorrow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the answer is almost always &quot;no&quot;. It should be &gt;obvious... That is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wholepoint! Perhaps it's just another step in &gt;evolution or natures way of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choosing it's Immortals.
</EM><BR>
<P>This has been dealt with by the cryonicists in their literature many times.  
<BR>
The other day I talked to a friend about these things.  We got on the topic 
<BR>
of immortality and she said what bothered her most was the idea of cultural 
<BR>
stagnation which I think is the largest problem a world of immortals would 
<BR>
have.
<BR>
<P>I think most immortals will be &quot;chosen&quot; simply by being alive when the final 
<BR>
breakthroughs are made.  And the other immortals will be &quot;chosen&quot; by being 
<BR>
born into this world.

<EM>&gt;I do however think that I will one day cease to &quot;be&quot; in the flesh, &gt;and I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secretly hope that it is via being shot by the jealous &gt;lifemate of some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alien babe while orbiting a massive Black Hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Won't there be plenty of single alien babes out there? lol  My own secret 
<BR>
hope is to die gloriously by stopping the conquest of humanity by hostile 
<BR>
aliens!  Hopefully, I will not have done this singlehandedly, because I 
<BR>
worry that immortality will rob us of our courage to rise up and risk our 
<BR>
lives against tyranny.
<BR>
<P>Afterward, a copy of me will be created that being identical will think just 
<BR>
like the old me and say, &quot;hey, I'm just a really good copy.. not the real 
<BR>
thing.&quot;  This will be because as the original I now say, &quot;a copy of me is 
<BR>
just not really me!&quot;  Endless arguments that used to involve me will now 
<BR>
still involve me. :)
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
