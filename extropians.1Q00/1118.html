Gregory Aharonian &lt;<A HREF="http://www.bustpatents.com/">http://www.bustpatents.com/</A>&gt; has a novel
<BR>
idea for using the stock market to make money attacking bad
<BR>
patents.  The full article is at
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://lwn.net/daily/patnews.html">http://lwn.net/daily/patnews.html</A>&gt;.  Here's an excerpt that
<BR>
describes that the basic idea...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;...is to find weak (portfolios of) patents for which, thanks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the craziness of the Internet, their assignee's stock
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;price is bubble-ish to the point of having a high price and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;volume (creating liquidity and volatility to exploit).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After very thorough prior art searches, one launches
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lawsuits to get courts to declare the patents to be invalid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while at the same time buying put options (or just shorting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the stocks for those more risk-adverse).  With careful market
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;timing and public information campaign based on the patent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;truly being crap, you could legitimately push down the price
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the stocks and collect on your options/shorts.  With
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;billion dollar valuations, the profit potential would be in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the tens of millions of dollars, if not more. By raising
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enough money to implement such a strategy against multiple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;companies, a few are bound to hit for the big bucks, given
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the statistics of invalidity of most software patents.  And
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;given the lengthy proceedings surrounding such lawsuits,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there are additional profit opportunities as the stocks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rebound then get pounded down again as some of the patents
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;get invalidated in the court.
<BR>
<P><P>I used to think that a similar strategy could be employed
<BR>
against any company whose valuation is based on proprietary
<BR>
technology which could be reengineered for substantially less
<BR>
money than the technology adds to the company's valuation:  
<BR>
reengineer the technology in secret, short the stock, give
<BR>
the technology away.  I'm quite skeptical of this idea now
<BR>
because I think you'd need to create a perfect substitute
<BR>
(bug-for-bug in software terms) and do lots of marketing to
<BR>
ensure your success, both of which require lots of capital.
