I wonder... with all of the talk about the wonders of
<BR>
nanotechnology and the work on designing the stuff
<BR>
itself... has there been any work on creating a
<BR>
computer language for it to operate by?... I don't
<BR>
know if our current ones are as workeable for
<BR>
controlling them as they could be.
