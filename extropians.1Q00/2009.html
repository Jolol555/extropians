<EM>&gt; &gt; Um, a 50% efficiency figure for LEDs sounds a bit on the high side. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  confident that the efficiency is high. Last I heard, the white light
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  ones are about to push the efficiency of fluorescents/gas-discharge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  somewhere around 18%(?), which is pretty darned cool. Ultraefficient red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  LEDs might be quite a bit higher, like 30-35%. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Mike, now, you know me, I usually add disclaimers when I'm unsure
<BR>
of something...  Though you raise a point, that I did misspeak
<BR>
in my original message, since I said &quot;LED&quot; when I intended to
<BR>
say &quot;Laser&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From &quot;Photonics Spectra&quot; (Optical Industry rag), January 2000, pg 91:
</EM><BR>
&quot;During the last several years, high-power diode lasers based on
<BR>
bars have developed rapidly in optical output and in life-time.
<BR>
In only five years, the typical output form a single commercially
<BR>
available diode laser has jumped from 20 to 50 W continuous wave (CW),
<BR>
and typical expected lifetimes increased from 1000 to 10,000 h.  This
<BR>
amounts to a factor of 25 performance increase for commercially available
<BR>
high-power diode lasers.
<BR>
<P>The high reliability allows users to combine large groups of diode lasers
<BR>
to create &quot;stacks.&quot;  Today diode laser stacks with 20 to 25 individual
<BR>
diode laser submounts at 40 to 50 W CW each deliver 1 kW or more of
<BR>
optical output from an area roughtly 10x40 mm.  At 50W CW per bar, the
<BR>
electro-optical efficiency reaches almost 50 percent.  This makes the diode
<BR>
laser the most efficient artificial light source in general.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[These are primarily far-red/near-IR lasers they are talking about.]
<BR>
<P>Now, I will freely admit that this isn't &quot;white light&quot;.  However
<BR>
it is my impression that getting high efficiency lasers is more
<BR>
difficult than high efficiency LEDs.  So where the lasers go,
<BR>
the LEDs should follow (or maybe they will just use the lasers).
<BR>
Of course, I don't think I'd be fond of a 3 frequency (RGB),
<BR>
&quot;white&quot; light, so it would be nice to have some way to broaden
<BR>
the laser frequencies.  But these are just engineering problems.
<BR>
Since the &quot;blue light&quot; lasers are on a similar trend in terms of
<BR>
power output and reliability, I think we can say that in the not
<BR>
too distant future, we &quot;might&quot; have some very efficient light sources.
<BR>
I say might, because my recent review of the very limited material
<BR>
on electrodeless fluorescents seems to indicate there *might* be a
<BR>
manufacturer conspiracy to keep these out of the hands of U.S. consumers.
<BR>
I'm hoping to get some time over the next week or two to collect
<BR>
the references for people to peruse.  If the same thing were to
<BR>
happen with white-light laser combinations, we might never see them.
<BR>
<P>While I don't have the reference handy, I believe the best &quot;lab&quot;
<BR>
result I've seen is ~65% efficiency.
<BR>
<P>(Why do I know this stuff???  Because I've got to have some way to
<BR>
beam all of the energy harvested in space down to the planetary surface
<BR>
to dismantle it so we can construct the SI.  Eugene is such a nit-picker
<BR>
about not wanting to melt the planet, so I've got to deliver the energy
<BR>
as efficiently as possible...)  Plus, I'm not fond of the spectral
<BR>
distribution from most fluorescents and I get really tired of changing
<BR>
the incandescents in my house.  Necessity is the mother of research.

<EM>&gt; I dunno about efficiency numbers but FYI LED's are replacing incadesants 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on trucks.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Naturally, with the way they put panels together now-a-days, it
<BR>
takes 8 hours to change a light bulb when they burn out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is they cost (a LOT) more.  But the price is going down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

As the volume increases, that should be the case.
