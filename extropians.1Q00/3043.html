<EM>&gt;&gt;Certainly, so long as it doesn't get inundated by anarchists who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;closet socialists (the whole Eugene gang).

<EM>&gt;&gt;Mike Lorrey

<P>I feel the need to butt in with my two cents worth here.  In &quot;left&quot; 
<BR>
anarchist thought, two very different definitions of socialism are 
<BR>
recognized.  The first, &quot;state socialism&quot;, is the familiar authoritarian 
<BR>
Marxist kind that we're all familiar with, and the second (in opposition to 
<BR>
the first),
<BR>
&quot; . . . To quote Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism is 'the no-government system of 
<BR>
socialism.' [Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets, p. 46]. In other words, 
<BR>
'the abolition of exploitation and oppression of man by man, that is the 
<BR>
abolition of private property [i.e. capitalism] and government.' [Errico 
<BR>
Malatesta, 'Towards Anarchism,' in Man!, M. Graham (Ed), p. 75]&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Anarchism, therefore, is a political theory that aims to create a society 
<BR>
which is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists 
<BR>
maintain that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social 
<BR>
system and so work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social 
<BR>
equality. They see the goals of liberty and equality as mutually 
<BR>
self-supporting. Or, in Bakunin's famous dictum:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and 
<BR>
injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.' 
<BR>
[The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 269]&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot; . . . rather than being purely anti-government or anti-state, anarchism is 
<BR>
primarily a movement against hierarchy. Why? Because hierarchy is the 
<BR>
organisational structure that embodies authority. Since the state is the 
<BR>
&quot;highest&quot; form of hierarchy, anarchists are, by definition, anti-state; but 
<BR>
this is not a sufficient definition of anarchism. This means that real 
<BR>
anarchists are opposed to all forms of hierarchical organisation, not only 
<BR>
the state. . . .&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From _An Anarchist FAQ_ Sect A.1 What is anarchism?

<P><P><EM>&gt;Initially the list could be promoted to libertarian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarcho-capitalist types. After it has 100+ subscribers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and has been going for a month or two, it could also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be promoted to other anarchists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe means can be found to bridge the gap between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right and left anarchists. In an anarcho-capitalist world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with property rights, left anarchists can acquire property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and can, on that property, implement socialist systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Provided they don't attempt to coercively impose their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems on others, they wouldn't disturb harmony.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The list guidelines could spell out how right and left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchists might coexist harmoniously. Attacks between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right and left anarchists would be discouraged. The list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be moderated.

<P>Please don't construe this as an attack or an attempt to generate some sort 
<BR>
of flame war.  My intent is to point people to information that they're 
<BR>
probably not familiar with; it is my perception that most of the people on 
<BR>
the list are not very familiar with the body of &quot;left&quot; anarchist political 
<BR>
theory.  Located at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/</A> is _An 
<BR>
Anarchist FAQ_, this is an excellent source with a huge amount of data.
