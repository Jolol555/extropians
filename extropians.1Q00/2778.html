It doesn't? lol! :)
<BR>
<P>Actually, I did and you are basically right.  Wordy means &quot;using more words 
<BR>
than necessary to express thought.&quot;  And as Robert Bradbury pointed out 
<BR>
Robert delves into complex concepts where his powers of expression and 
<BR>
strong vocabulary are sometimes very necessary.

<BR>
Damien has to artfully simplify many concepts without entirely losing
<BR>
their complexity while Robert has to avoid doing so because that
<BR>
might extinguish refined or subtle distinctions.  There are two
<BR>
very different arts being practiced by these individuals, each
<BR>
of which has their own place and value.

(end)
<BR>
<P>Other times I think he is showing off a little and being a touch wordy! :)  
<BR>
I did basically understand the meaning of wordy but was simply trying to be 
<BR>
nice and stand up for Robert by saying I appreciate the chance to expand my 
<BR>
vocabulary and knowledge base.  Then again, I learn alot from so many on 
<BR>
this list I could never credit you all.
