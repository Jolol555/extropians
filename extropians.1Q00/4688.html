<EM>&gt; &gt; ... ICANN sucks! What would be interesting is if you had some alt

<EM>&gt; &gt; registries, and the linux people put it into their default distros
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so that all their users started using the alt registries, would that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eventually cause the other OS vendors such as M$ to include support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for the registries in their products? I am really surprised no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in linux-land has come up with the idea for &quot;open source&quot; registries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not sanctioned by ICANN.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Define &quot;using the alt registries&quot;.  Sure I suppose it would be easy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a large number of Linucians (not all of them) to *recognize*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domain.tux.  But who'd want such a domain unless they're publishing only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material of interest to penguins?  And what is MS's customers'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motivation to demand access to such material?
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering the huge response to Corel's linux release, and their plans
<BR>
to go head to head with microsoft, I think that given a sufficient PR
<BR>
campaign among ISPs, microsoft will have to do it to compete. You can
<BR>
already configure what your registry servers are yourself in NT IIS, so
<BR>
its just a matter of getting microsoft to enter it as a pre-installed
<BR>
registry. Thats not hard, and again, could probably be cured with money.
