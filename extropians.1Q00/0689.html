<P><EM>&gt;At the moment, the &quot;manufacturing&quot; industries are less than 18% of GDP, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such industries do a lot of non-manufacturing spending (like sales,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transport, storage, ...) Total spending on the design of manufacturables is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably much less.  So even making manufacturing and design free still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leaves people paying for &gt;70% of the things they pay for now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but suppose half a `primitive' population (such as California) were
<BR>
paid to pray to the gods and perform fertility sorcery, and then a cultural
<BR>
shockwave abolished this faith. What follows? They weren't making or doing
<BR>
anything truly useful (except keeping themselves occupied and perhaps
<BR>
raising morale), now nothing has changed except the readiness of the other
<BR>
50 percent to pay for them. (Is that a useful analogy? Maybe not.)
<BR>
<P>Many of the services ancillary to today's production and distribution would
<BR>
evaporate if anything like anything boxes were plentiful, however
<BR>
circumscribed by protective regulation. What, then, are the sales staff
<BR>
selling? What goods are being carefully stored and moved long distances?
<BR>
Who fill the skyscrapers doing what? What vast trucks rumble over the big
<BR>
bridges? Feedstocks? Maybe, but modestly smart nano systems might well cope
<BR>
with what suddenly becomes a provision of services on the order of piping
<BR>
in water and power and piping out sewage. (And even those will surely be
<BR>
handled nearer to home, ideally by nearly-closed recycling).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The fraction of software effort now using the open source route is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;miniscule, the gains to specialization in production are now enormous,
</EM><BR>
<P>That was now, this is then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and people don't give away raw materials with low enough transport and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processing costs to be useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume this is the bottleneck - we really can't expect to make
<BR>
*everything* we need out of dirt-cheap diamond. So some feed stocks will
<BR>
have to be gathered, moved to convenient storehouses, shipped to the home
<BR>
user (or to module-makers, for local shipping).
<BR>
<P>But of course this assumes bizarrely that *only* replicative nanotech
<BR>
happens in the future.  Moore's Law hasn't shut down, the computers are
<BR>
getting better all the time, and nano is feeding into that curve with
<BR>
smaller and faster computers built at molecular scales and then *copyable*
<BR>
by nano-mints, and iterating onward in a blurry spiral. With AI agents
<BR>
taking over most of the scut-work of filing and organizing and perhaps even
<BR>
entertaining, and praying to the gods for us, many service industries will
<BR>
go the way of that 30 percent of manufacturing etc.
<BR>
<P>No?
