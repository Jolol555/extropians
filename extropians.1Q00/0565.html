<EM>&gt; &gt; Ahh, I can't help you with that, but I'd suggest that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; major economic issue at play here is a furthering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shift in the economy towards information as the pivotal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resource.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes and no.  There are very subtle forces at work.  
</EM><BR>
<P>To be clear, the question I'm trying to answer is the effect of MNT on the
<BR>
structure of the economy, rather than on the total size or affluence of the
<BR>
economy.  E.g., will nanotech eliminate work?  Will it eliminate the market?
<BR>
Will it eliminate the notion of property?
<BR>
<P>In this regard, some germane facts about nanotech would seem to be:
<BR>
<P>1) It will take large amounts of intellectual work (whether supplied by
<BR>
humans or other agents) to create, debug, and verify nanotech designs.
<BR>
<P>2) This intellectual work, at least at the early stages, will require a
<BR>
large financial investment (to pay the humans doing the work).
<BR>
<P>3) Those who put in this investment are likely to want to reap a profit by
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>4) Nanotech designs themselves are merely information.  Like software (or
<BR>
pharmaceuticals) nanotech-created objects will have a high R &amp; D cost and a
<BR>
low unit cost.  It will also be possible to copy, transmit, and pirate
<BR>
nanotech designs.
<BR>
<P>The combination of the above elements suggests to me that:
<BR>
<P>a) Stakeholders in nanotech will seek to preserve existing intellectual
<BR>
property laws in order to protect their profits.
<BR>
<P>b) The elimination of those intellectual property laws might be detrimental
<BR>
to the advancement of nanotech (since it might discourage investment in
<BR>
developing nano designs).
<BR>
<P>c) So long as intellectual work from truly intentional agents is required to
<BR>
design nano, those agents will seek compensation, and we're likely to remain
<BR>
in an market-based economy.
<BR>
<P>Now, I'm not a specialist in this area, but I'd guess that there are
<BR>
academic papers that cover issues like b) and c) in the abstract or in other
<BR>
domains.  For example, papers on the impact of patent law and software
<BR>
copyrights.  Or papers (possibly just being authored now) on open-source
<BR>
development or freeware.  
<BR>
<P>regards,
<BR>
