<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;proportional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Without offering an evidence that it would not be. There are very few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;today where a national leader can go about his business like an average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The rate of assassination of national leaders is somewhere around 60%,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worldwide. Those that stay in power longest are those who don't expose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know where you get 60%, but assuming that's true, I bet that 95%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percent of those assasinations occurred in closed or undemocratic societies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Transparency will solve that.
</EM><BR>
<P>How? Bald statements don't make it true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, you are again mixing apples and oranges.  You are talking about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of affairs &quot;today.&quot;  I am talking about &quot;tomorrow&quot; where there will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater technological means to protect the safety of those leaders from whom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we require the greatest transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps you came in late in the thread, but Mike Lorrey was replying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal that once a democratic &quot;Global&quot; government was in place there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be no need for such things as &quot;national&quot; security.  I never proposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; *all* government disappear.  I don't want to (nor expect that I ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; live in a global anarchy.  I presume that there will *always* be rules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; means by which to ensure that they are complied with.  A global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be no less a government than a national government.  And as long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; there is government, and as long as antitrust rules are deemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;beneficial to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; society, there will be antitrust rules and the means by which to enforce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How about anti-trust action against government. After all, its a monopoly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for one monopoly to go around destroying other monopolies is not justice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;merely showing the hypocracy of the idea of government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well presently its not against the law to be the only government in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state.  In fact I can't think of how multiple governments per jurisdiction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could possibly work.  There's nothing hypocritical about it.  I think you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letting your hyberole get away with you again :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Study up kiddo. Check out David Friedman's work on PPL and PPA systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;As long as one person wants what another person has, or hates another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;person for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;no good reason, there will always be a need for people to defend themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;against violence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And so?
</EM><BR>
<P>Finis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In your world, the average person would be deluged every day by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;notifications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that they were monitored by 200 national intelligence and law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;agencies, 3,465,783 corporations, and 54,567,892 individuals. If you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;inbox is big now, wait till your xanadu is reached....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You've never heard of a killfile?
</EM><BR>
<P>You are not only being sarcastically obtuse, you are being facetiously naive and
<BR>
ignorant.
<BR>
What is the purpose of mutuality if you toss away every instance of your being
<BR>
notified that someone surveilled you? How will you filter out all of those
<BR>
notifications? With the same PIII computer on your desktop that you claim can
<BR>
process the entire worlds surveillance video feeds? Get real.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Although keeping in mind that for everytime you *get* information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; someone else you also have to *give* that same information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;yourself, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't know how anxious you would be to be doing research on 90% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; population.  That could very well make you a *very* popular guy :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So what if I tell 6 billion people what my sexual preference is? I tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fact, and I can get 6 billion facts on the same question about each and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;one of those people. Its not equivalent. I may have pissed off a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;minority, but I now KNOW a huge amount of data about a lot of people, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gives me power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That gives you *nothing* except that X% of the population is homosexual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What are you going to do with that?  Take over the world?  Here let me help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you: I'm heterosexual.  Only 5,999,999,999 more people to ask and then boy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will you be powerful.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I were a homophobe, and a psychopathic one at that, I would then know where
<BR>
every gay person in the world lived, and when they would be home, etc. A
<BR>
homophobe would distribute this information to all other homophobes on the
<BR>
planet, so every time a homophobe wanted to beat or kill a gay person, they
<BR>
would know exactly where and when to find any gay person they felt like offing.
<BR>
A homophobe could likewise mail biochemical weapons to every gay person on the
<BR>
planet embedded in a free sample Lambda sticker, with preprogrammed deployment
<BR>
dates. Are you starting to get the picture? Fascists love systems like yours...
