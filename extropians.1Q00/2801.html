<P>
Today, I was reading the Los Angeles Times astronomy report and learned that
<BR>
Mercury, Mars, the moon, Jupiter and Saturn will be lined up in the western
<BR>
sky tonight.  Thinking about the possibility of a clear sky (It's been
<BR>
raining today) and appreciating the planetary performance, I decided to
<BR>
return to work and continue reading the paper.
<BR>
<P>Another event will be occurring in the sky of Chechnya tonight, but not
<BR>
within my view.  &quot;Resurfacing in Grozny to Search for Signs of Life&quot; and one
<BR>
woman's words touched me deeply: 
<BR>
<P>&quot;On Sunday, 73-year-old Viktoria Kudradzhyan left her 65-year-old crippled
<BR>
sister in the cellar of what remains of their former home and went looking
<BR>
for food. Bent in half by osteoporosis, she picked her way along the dusty,
<BR>
smoky road, her red head scarf the only dot of color in the landscape. 
<BR>
She approached a feeding station set up just the day before by Russia's
<BR>
Capital Emergencies Ministry but was told the food was gone. So she meekly
<BR>
turned around, lifted her head to get her bearings, then lowered it and
<BR>
headed home. 
<BR>
<P>A passerby stopped and offered her a loaf of bread, which she placed
<BR>
carefully in a grimy cloth bag. Then, unable to contain herself, she
<BR>
sputtered: &quot;Just look at me. I wasn't always poor. I used to have a big
<BR>
apartment full of nice things. But the Russians burned down my house. Now
<BR>
all I have is this.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>She gestured to her filthy coat, which once had been either beige or gray.
<BR>
Soot lined the deep creases of her face. &quot;Because of the war,&quot; she said, &quot;I
<BR>
am now ashamed to show myself.  ...&quot;
