Subject: Re: Drugs - what makes them do it?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What was the reasons for the bans? I think (here the historians might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help) that concerns about public health was the major official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason. Before this time, public health was a problem that was too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hard to deal with, but at this time it appeared more and more possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it could be fixed by a benevolent state and hence that it should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be fixed; hence the anti-drug stance previously taken mainly by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smaller organisations could now be implemented nationwide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>There's an idea that the reasons for the bans were racially motivated. I'm
<BR>
not fully endorsing this viewpoint, but it's something to consider, and I
<BR>
don't doubt that it was at least a factor, even if its influence is
<BR>
exagerated. The idea is that opium was the moral scapegoat when there was a
<BR>
large influx of Chinese immigrants, because it was perceived as their drug
<BR>
of choice. Similarly for marijuana when there was a large influx of Mexican
<BR>
immigrants. Cocaine was associated with blacks, and I have seen prints of
<BR>
old newspaper stories about &quot;cocaine-crazed negroes raping white women&quot; to
<BR>
back this up. I think all these drugs were banned in a single swoop called
<BR>
The Harrison Act (which, as I recall, left heroin legal out of neglect).
<BR>
As for public health.. research what happened right after drug prohibition
<BR>
was implemented, when many, many doctors were actually imprisoned for
<BR>
treating it as a public health issue (by administering morphine to opium
<BR>
addicts suffering from withdrawal).
<BR>
Regardless of the origins of drug prohibition, I don't think that the race
<BR>
issue remains a powerful factor today in continuing it. Part of continuing
<BR>
it is the fear of what would happen if it were discontinued - ask a man on
<BR>
the street his opinion of drug legalization - this is less true today, but
<BR>
as of a few years ago, I think the typical reaction someone would give you
<BR>
supports the idea that the general public thinks that as soon as drugs were
<BR>
legalized, everyone and their grandmother would immediately start shooting
<BR>
heroin and smoking crack, sell their remaining supply to 3 year olds, and go
<BR>
on murderous rampages afterwards.
<BR>
The reason for this fear is the moral panic about drug use.. which is left
<BR>
to explain.
