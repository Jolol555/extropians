What if I want to get rid of my truck, and need toothpicks, 
<BR>
an iron, an old copy of Dos 3.0 and a credit to do something
<BR>
later with (actually, I need to pay my debts and buy groceries).
<BR>
The owner of Dos wants flowers; the owner of iron wants
<BR>
a movie ticket, toothpicks are not there, my lender wants
<BR>
cash, and my grocer is offline.
<BR>
<P>It may be quite complicated in many cases.
<BR>
<P>Matching is harder too than just exchange for cash.
<BR>
<P>But barter definitely has some benefits.
<BR>
There are people who don't like money, and people who don't
<BR>
like IRS, and just curious people...
<BR>
<P>What if you include currency as one of the goods, so that
<BR>
the service could have all kinds of transactions, some of
<BR>
them taxable, some not?  Then you don't have a barter-vs-cash
<BR>
dilemma, you have a service that does everything that others
<BR>
do, plus barter...  
<BR>
<P>There are also alternate currencies that do not have to be
<BR>
exchanged for $.  That's also hard to tax.
<BR>
They can have external backing.  Like, in rights to stay
<BR>
at one's home as a guest or in personal sexual favors.
<BR>
Let the govt tax those  :-)
