<EM>&gt;Hmm, if so, what would are your grounds for opposing such a policy?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I care about some things that aren't measured well by GDP, such as pain,
<BR>
death, control of one's destiny, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Correct. I want markets to be used to prevent people from using inaccurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;justifications, but not to replace voting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Concentrating as much power as you propose into a small set of decisions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(e.g. what weights to give to growth, inequality, security, etc.) that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;average person is likely to have trouble thinking quantitatively about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;sounds like a recipe for testing the maxim &quot;power corrupts&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Consider the motto &quot;Futarchy: vote values, but bet beliefs&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I accept that people feel a need to &quot;participate&quot; in their government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and that participation via betting may not satisfy a lot of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need.  So I'd like to &quot;sublimate&quot; that urge by letting people vote on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the common objective function.  I don't really understand your concerns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here; could you elaborate?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;You spoke of giving a single agency responsibility for measuring the
<BR>
objective function. Such agencies always have some ability to add their
<BR>
own biases into the decisions involved in producing such indicators. You
<BR>
originally sounded like you wanted to encourage people to view the
<BR>
objective function as something to be decided largely by some technicians
<BR>
at that agency. That would concentrate more power than I want in a handfull
<BR>
of people, at least if it is handled the way economic statistics currently
<BR>
are.
<BR>
&nbsp;I want to insure that the value decisions are made by the average person
<BR>
if possible, or if that isn't possible, then by processes that the average
<BR>
person can understand well enough to hold accountable. I suspect that the
<BR>
average person will be better able to understand the value decisions being
<BR>
made if they are presented in the form &quot;bombing Serbia will increase GWP
<BR>
by 0.001% and cause 100 innocent people to die&quot; than if they are presented
<BR>
in the form of an objective function where the average person is asked for
<BR>
opinions on what numbers to use in weighting GWP versus innocent deaths.
