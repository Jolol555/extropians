<P>
I use or have used a fair number of legal, prescribed or over-the-counter
<BR>
drugs to modify asthma, headache, arthritic inflammation, digestive
<BR>
problems probably caused by the latter, antibruise goo, etc. No
<BR>
mood-improvers like SSRI but I'd give it a shot if I didn't worry abt the
<BR>
side effects. Very rarely a toke or two at a party if it's going around.
<BR>
When I was a kid, I used a fair bit of legally prescribed amphetamines,
<BR>
just the ticket for jump-starting an essay or short story or just plain
<BR>
having a good time at a party. Can't get it legally now, so I don't;
<BR>
probably would be reluctant for health reasons anyway. So my personal
<BR>
experience of `drugs' doesn't tell me much abt the sorts of chemicals that
<BR>
govts ban, or what it's like to use and get pharmacologically trapped by them.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, my legal use of speed gave me some sense of how abruptly
<BR>
the mental switches can be thrown. And I suspect medicos (by and large) and
<BR>
other highly self-controlled inner-directed types are profoundly alarmed by
<BR>
this fact. You can reset yr mood, usually in parallel with others, at a
<BR>
sporting event, at the movies, etc, or just by reading a funny or
<BR>
frightening book - but these events are either coordinated within a broadly
<BR>
socialised setting, or mild and easily broken. `Drugs' tend to be those
<BR>
chemicals that zap you hard, whip you into a divergent state that quite
<BR>
visibly interferes with `standard' inhibitory self-control (even if that's
<BR>
just by making you nod off in the street with a needle in yr arm, not a
<BR>
pleasant sight to conformers like me).
<BR>
<P>And even those highstakes achievers who manage a habit are likely to
<BR>
oscillate (as legal drunks do), to go unpredictable. Westciv technocracy
<BR>
doesn't care to have such people in positions of leverage (even though many
<BR>
are, of course). What's more, we have this background, if frequently
<BR>
hypocritical, maxim that everyone gets treated identically; so if a lawyer
<BR>
or surgeon is caught using, and can't use the old boy net or other method
<BR>
to escape court notice, they have to be slapped to demonstrate the fairness
<BR>
of the system.
<BR>
<P>But my guess is that it's the way `drugs' make people jagged or torpid or
<BR>
in some other way appear like green monkeys in a troop of grey monkeys that
<BR>
causes the hostility. SSRIs or valium readjust you, or numb your wilder
<BR>
side, so they're okay. E? Dunno. Too exultant? Dope? Too louche? Still,
<BR>
I've been waiting for Huxley's soma to be made mandatory for decades now,
<BR>
and it doesn't seem to be happening. Maybe they don't have the formula yet. 
<BR>
<P>I think the tendency, though (certainly in Oz), is for authorities to grow
<BR>
tired of the mess and waste and stupidity of the `war' and move slowly
<BR>
toward (i) containment-of-harm strategies like safe injecting rooms, and
<BR>
(ii) slackening of laws against mild relaxants or mood shifters.
