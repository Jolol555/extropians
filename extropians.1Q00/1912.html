<EM>&gt; (<A HREF="http://wired.lycos.com/wired/archive/8.01/futuretekture.html">http://wired.lycos.com/wired/archive/8.01/futuretekture.html</A>). Any

<EM>&gt; other ideas for what you can do with programmed bacteria, transgene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plants and good biotech?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not knowing much of the background of your story, I can only point out a few 
<BR>
interesting uses in various bits of SF I've read:
<BR>
<P>In &quot;The Helix and the Sword&quot;, there has been some sort of major war that has 
<BR>
wiped out humanity on the various planets. Humanity now lives on huge living 
<BR>
spaceships that resemble nautiluses (nautili?). They have mined the asteroid 
<BR>
belt and Saturn's rings until they have reached a resource crises. It seems 
<BR>
that none of their ships (or people) are very capable to entering even a low 
<BR>
gravity well any more. The idea of landing on even one of the lesser moons of 
<BR>
Jupiter seems like suicide.
<BR>
<P>In &quot;The Bohr Maker&quot;, nanotechnology has been rigidly suppressed by terran 
<BR>
authorities. The heroine accidently becomes infected with a rogue thought-
<BR>
controlled general-assembler called the 'bohr maker' and becomes a hunted 
<BR>
fugitive. She eventually ends up living in a huge floating tree in space, 
<BR>
hiding amongst a group of rogue genengineers. She eventually discovers that the 
<BR>
entire tree is not only a living ship but also a sophisticated nano-fabrication 
<BR>
factory that makes anything 'man-portable' pale in comparison.
<BR>
<P>I don't remember the authors of either book off-hand. There was also one book I 
<BR>
read recently in which giant modified bees were used to build skyscrapers.
