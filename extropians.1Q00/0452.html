<P><EM>&gt; Well, this raises some very interesting points.  It tooks some time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for me to understand the situation in Chechniya because we really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't understand Russian history very well.  The people in that
</EM><BR>
[...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; region very strongly &quot;independence&quot; minded, it would be questionable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether even their own self-elected (local) government would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much control over them (similar to the &quot;tribes&quot; in Afganastan or Somalia).
</EM><BR>
<P>Take note of the Basques at the northern periphery of Spain, they are also
<BR>
generally a very strong and independent people who have been fighting for
<BR>
independence for some time, I am only superficially familiar with the
<BR>
situation, though. The history of attempted integration and/or dominance of
<BR>
people of this nature is not littered with success, although I tend to think
<BR>
(based on my experiences of living in migrant cultures in Australia), that
<BR>
there can be success in cultural integration after one-two generations,
<BR>
however our cases are mostly with chosen relocation and integration, not one
<BR>
that has been imposed. There are likely to be other people more versed and
<BR>
specialised in this area of knowledge than me though!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However the situation in Chechniya and the recent articles on micro-states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do point out some very interesting problems we will be facing.  Lets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say for example the GM or cloning issues turns out to be unresolvable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Will the only solution be for the pro-technology people to move to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a specific location and declare independence?  If so, how does one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplish this.  The people in Chechniya seem to provide good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examples of how not to do it, while the people of Quebec may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a process that shows how it might be done.
</EM><BR>
<P>Consider intellectual micro-states in addition to physical ones. Electronic
<BR>
networks are an interesting evolution from books, and other means of
<BR>
physical intellectual communities, to intellectual communities that are more
<BR>
interactive and semi-realtime. Physically, people may like to reside in
<BR>
different places, but they may choose to exist within broader intellectual
<BR>
cultures. Which is why I have an &quot;obscure&quot; interest in the extropians and
<BR>
the digital society, but my next door neighbour is busy trying every chilli
<BR>
recipe she can based upon the chilli heads interest group! Or, why another
<BR>
friend of mine travels the world going to Tango gigs, or another visits all
<BR>
the Toastmasters groups: these are other instances of distributed global
<BR>
cultures that weave through parts of society, now more accessible with the
<BR>
digital medium.
<BR>
<P>In the same way, maybe GM food producers/eaters can exist as distributed
<BR>
culture. If it is generally positive for people, then it will grow in
<BR>
acceptance, and become dominant, if not, it will stagnate, wither and
<BR>
possibly die. Smoking is perhaps a good analogy. Once popular, it is now
<BR>
largely unpopular due to increased knowledge and information about its
<BR>
effects. Although, smoking is still tolerated, but the options open to
<BR>
smokers are increasingly smaller, and non-smokers don't want to suffer
<BR>
increased insurance/etc costs for smokers; under the guise of &quot;you choose
<BR>
the risks and options in your life, as do I, but above and beyond those
<BR>
considered necessary, lets not pay for the consequences of each other
<BR>
choices&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the debate becomes more generalisable to roles of individuals and
<BR>
the structure of society, in terms making choices, accepting consequences,
<BR>
defining &quot;accepted common&quot; standards, looking out for ones self, but also
<BR>
providing a social support framework, etc.
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
