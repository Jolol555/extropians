<EM>&gt; &gt; You are automatically assuming that the original works of the artist

<EM>&gt; &gt; were a clear perspective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would not assume so, though, by the same token, I'd rather not have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government deciding these things, especially since its interests might never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be in line with a clear perspective.  Witness last years campaign against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Serbia by the US government.  Didn't the State Department do its best to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paint the Serbs as bloodthirsty demons and the Albanians as helpless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victims?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But aside from this example, one might claim, well, there are people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slant things in other ways, so why is the government doing so worse than any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others?  First, the government is, sadly, assumed by many to be the correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of view in anything.  This means the government line is taken to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct.  You know how people trust the FDA to regulate drugs and the like?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, government is not an equal player here.  When a company slants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something, generally, most people are suspicious if not cynical.  With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government, this is not so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Second, government is not equal in other ways.  Since it makes and enforces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws, it cannot be equated to others players in the information market.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has an interest in staying in that position of rule making and rule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement -- one in making itself appear to be doing a great job or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best possible job and to also appear as a knight in shining armor when any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems do arise.  (On the latter, note how Hillary Clinton recently headed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the government campaign against giving Ritalin and Prozac to kids.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the same government who approved it for such uses!  There was no talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along the lines of, &quot;Oops, we made a mistake.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Chislenko what he thinks...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Orwell also spent some time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1936-1939).  He even joined a militia there.  He did get to see how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Communists, especially Stalinists, operate up close and personal.  In fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he wrote a book on it, _Homage to Catalonia_ in 1938.  This is a far cry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from just hanging out in Cambridge.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I heard about that the other day on the anarchist newsgroup. His
<BR>
animosity towards Stalin was because Josef supposedly didn't keep his
<BR>
promises to the spanish communists. However, Spain was hardly a
<BR>
communist country at that point, it was merely a rather ravaged country.
<BR>
Its good to see he stood up for his principles, even though once he got
<BR>
a taste of the integrity of that side, he wound up naming names to
<BR>
British Intelligence the rest of his life...
