</EM><BR>
<P>That's exactly my point.  *Here*, there are always sacrifices to be
<BR>
made.  But maybe that's just the natural result of living with evolved
<BR>
intelligence, limited processing power, and material non-omnipotence. 
<BR>
Maybe the whole concept of a &quot;problem&quot; is something that only exists in
<BR>
our mortal world.  Maybe all problems have obvious solutions, if only
<BR>
you're smart enough.  Maybe it's possible to *really* *really* win,
<BR>
forever, and completely.
<BR>
<P>Most philosophies deal with the &quot;problem of evil&quot; by rationalizing it in
<BR>
some way or another, because they can't get rid of it.  My stance is
<BR>
that evil is evil, problems are problems, and the world would be well
<BR>
rid of all of them.
<BR>
<P>I won't say &quot;perfection&quot;, because that implies stasis.  The word I'm
<BR>
looking for is &quot;flawlessness&quot;, maybe.  I think that life can exist,
<BR>
growing and vital, without anything whatsoever being wrong in any way. 
<BR>
That's the world I want to live in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How have you said your goodbyes??  You still have at least several decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left in coporeal form.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, nonsense.  I may be only 20, but at least half of my life *here* is
<BR>
over, and probably more like two-thirds.  It'd be foolish to bet on an
<BR>
apocalypse, because the effects of that kind of thinking show up long
<BR>
before the date of any possible payoff.  Nonetheless, I'm not counting
<BR>
on outliving my favorite TV show.
