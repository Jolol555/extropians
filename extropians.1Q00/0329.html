<EM>&gt; &gt; I have no knowledge of the practical application of Cryonics so I'd like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to ask those that do if the following is a nutty idea. As I understand it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some otherwise promising cryoprotectants are rendered useless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because they're too viscous to infuse at body temperature, much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; less during cool down. But what if you engineered a bacteria to produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the cryoprotectant and then infused the bacteria; wouldn't that make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; viscosity of the substance irrelevant and as a bonus be dirt cheap too?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have to time it with the immune system. If it is too active it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will attack the bacteria and you won't get much use from them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anders, I think we have to solve this problem anyway for biobots to
<BR>
work.  Two possibilities are temporary immune system suppression
<BR>
or reengineering the bacteria so they aren't quite so immunogenic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand, infusing them when the patient is cooling might mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have a too short time window to produce cryoprotectants before they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freeze too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true, but you could engineer the bacteria so they function
<BR>
optimally slightly above freezing.  So you have the body in relative
<BR>
&quot;stasis&quot; while the bacteria are happy as clams in mud.  Once you
<BR>
take the temperature down to near freezing you have significantly
<BR>
longer windows in which to do therapeutic interventions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my opinion the best solution would be to add genes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryoprotectants connected to a hormone promotor from some insect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either prenatally or through gene therapy during adulthood, and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activate the cryoprotectant production when it becomes necessary. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involve bacteria when there are trillions of cells?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Oppps, Anders slips a little (such a rare occurence, that I've got
<BR>
to grab the fleeting meme).  The problem with this is the same problem
<BR>
with Greg Stock's &quot;added chromosome&quot; discussed at Extro4.  Any protein
<BR>
manufactured in your body post-immune-system training is going to be
<BR>
viewed as &quot;foreign&quot; (i.e. viral in origin) and will cause a killer
<BR>
cell attack on those cells producing such proteins.  Whether this would
<BR>
be significant in the time frame of cryonics suspension is questionable,
<BR>
but you will have to suppress that arm of the immune system on cryonic
<BR>
reanimation until you purge those proteins.  In Greg's approach, you
<BR>
either have to suppress that arm of the immune system entirely (not good
<BR>
from the perspective of cancer &amp; viral disease prevention) or find a way
<BR>
to train the immune system to tolerate any &quot;new&quot; proteins.  Not impossible,
<BR>
but at the edge of current science.
<BR>
<P>It remains an open question whether or not we will easily (or soon)
<BR>
achieve reliable exact and specific universal cell modifications
<BR>
in vivo.  I've devoted a fair amount of thought to the problem and
<BR>
while I think it is doable, I think it requires a significant amount
<BR>
of protein engineering beyond current state-of-the-art.  The problem
<BR>
with Anders' approach is that you might only get 20-80% of the cells
<BR>
producing the proteins with current/near-future technologies and that
<BR>
probably doesn't bode well for reliable reanmimation.  On the other
<BR>
hand you can probably distribute bacteria uniformly enough to get
<BR>
close to 100% treatment.  Getting the bacteria across the blood-brain
<BR>
barrier might be a bit of a problem, but if the proteins are small
<BR>
enough, you can probably get the normal transport mechanisms to do
<BR>
the job for you.  Might have to be a bit warmer than 0C for that to
<BR>
work however.  (Of course it is worth noting that current gene
<BR>
therapies cannot cross the blood-brain barrier as well, you have
<BR>
to administer the delivery vehicles directly to those parts of
<BR>
the brain you want to treat.)
<BR>
<P>I'll note in passing that this isn't a &quot;simple&quot; problem since you
<BR>
probably want to get the antifreeze proteins in both intracellular
<BR>
and intercellular spaces so you either have to have bacteria or
<BR>
cell made proteins be transported around or be producing them in
<BR>
both locations.
<BR>
<P>However, John, this was a great reference for me and I will keep this
<BR>
in the bottom of my tool-kit box.
