<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Let [spike] try another angle.  As someone pointed out, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; careful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to never post anything that might become illegal at any time in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;future. This is exactly what might help defeat tyranny...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amara Graps: I don't put very much weight on methods to defeat tyranny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that rely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on &quot;mass&quot;-something, mass-movements, mass-media, etc. What I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best is my local environment, and the person that I can rely on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best is me. Therefore, my personal philosophy is to &quot;act locally&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<P>OK Ive an idea.  Please some of you computer gurus tell me if it
<BR>
is possible.  Could one write a virus that sits in an email message
<BR>
that does nothing other than forward a copy of itself to a random
<BR>
person on the receiver's email list?  If so, one could write a virus-free
<BR>
<P>message that says something like:
<BR>
<P>{
<BR>
&quot;I like green eggs and spam.&quot;*
<BR>
<P>*By the way, gentle person reading this message, your computer
<BR>
has already sent out a copy of this message to someone in your
<BR>
address book with your name as sender.  Yes I know I am a virus
<BR>
author, the most repugnant lifeform known and I shall burn in digital
<BR>
hell for all eternity.  Be that as it may, should green eggs and spam
<BR>
ever be made illegal by some future tyrannical government, you
<BR>
are on the permanent record as liking these items.  Think it over and
<BR>
help keep cyberspace free.
<BR>
<P>[Fake out.  Theres no virus here.  Just wanted to get you thinking.]
<BR>
}
<BR>
<P>Whaddya think?  We could send them out to friends without
<BR>
a real virus, just as kind of a mind opener or something.  spike
