Yes, on a social level Bill &quot;Long Now&quot; Joy seems such a historically narrow 
<BR>
grumpy grandpa. If his descendants incrementally and voluntarily choose to 
<BR>
become more robotic, why Bill is horrified, and fears true human decency is 
<BR>
lost. That's now the way it was when he was a kid, by gum, why if God had 
<BR>
intended men to fly, he'd have given us wings.

<P>Robin, I love your 'grumpy grandpa' phrase and analogy! :)  It is so true.  
<BR>
I can just imagine...
<BR>
<P>grumpy great-great grandpa:  I didn't have the internet when I grew up!  We 
<BR>
got along just fine with telephones!  Damn kids today are on that 'internet 
<BR>
thing' all the time!
<BR>
<P>grumpy great grandpa: What is wrong with the old style internet?  Today kids 
<BR>
just have to jack themselves into the net!  Something is just plain sick and 
<BR>
twisted about that!  Bunch of zombies!
<BR>
<P>grumpy grandpa: What the hell is going on here!!  I could can understand 
<BR>
temporarily jacking into the the net!  But permanently uploading!  Nature 
<BR>
gave us these bodies, modify them, don't abandon them!  My daughter is going 
<BR>
to marry some damn sentient who is just an AI program!  And he says he's 
<BR>
making a sacrifice by 'downloading' into a synthetic body so he can meet us 
<BR>
all in person and 'be there' for the wedding ceremony!  Where did she meet 
<BR>
this wierdo?  There are plenty of normal cyborgs and moreaus she could have 
<BR>
gotten involved with.  There goes the family tree!!
<BR>
<P>There was a long-running and very popular skit on SNL several years back 
<BR>
with Dana Carvey.  It had him as a grumpy grandpa who would angrily say how 
<BR>
back in his day they got by just fine without some modern convenience.  Then 
<BR>
he would explain how with details that left the audience laughing and 
<BR>
gasping in horror at the same time!  Very funny but somewhat twisted 
<BR>
material.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg :)
