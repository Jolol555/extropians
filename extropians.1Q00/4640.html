<EM>&gt; As a hopeful inventor can someone explain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me why patents are considered bad?
</EM><BR>
<P>In a sec...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual profit from their hard won intellectual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Nor is anyone suggesting otherwise, I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is intellectual property worth less because it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; springs sometimes so easily from the creative mind? 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that has little to do with it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps only manual labor is considered of any value. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, intellectual value is as real as any other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe I should tell my plumber I'm against 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying for his unique efforts and he should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create an unleaky faucet for me for free?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, *but*... if you watch him fix your faucet,
<BR>
and then want to help your neighbor fix his, he
<BR>
should not be able to stop you by applying for
<BR>
a patent on (parts of) the process.  This is the
<BR>
trademark (so to speak, :) of monopoly.  You may
<BR>
charge for your work (or not, as pleases you), 
<BR>
but you should not be able to charge for someone
<BR>
*else's* work, even if your work was necessary 
<BR>
for them to do what they did.  Of course, if you
<BR>
have some contract directly with them, that's 
<BR>
another thing; I (we?) only object to your legal
<BR>
&quot;right&quot; to own another's work because it is 
<BR>
similar to your own.
