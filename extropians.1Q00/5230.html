<EM>&gt; All advanced projects on the Internet that I can think of have

<EM>&gt; the government is limited to watching for old issues (can a child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see naked butts online?), providing general resources ($ for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thicker carrier cables), and general regulation of development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (such as patent laws).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if the government was doing more good than harm in any of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; areas, it would still mean that the visionary development is done by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private individuals, and the democratic governance is only able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide support for already established structures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Regarding libraries, yes, Carnegie and many more regular people have
<BR>
donated time, money, and materials for the support of the library system,
<BR>
however it survives because it has been supported by public funds
<BR>
beginning in the 19th century for the public good. Yes, I don't always
<BR>
get what I want there, yet it has and still serves a critical function for
<BR>
millions of people.
<BR>
<P>Now, if we want to champion individualism over collectivism the system in
<BR>
the
<BR>
United States is a slippery target. I can not think of any part of our
<BR>
history
<BR>
that government legislation did not provide the foundation for the &quot;rugged
<BR>
individualists&quot; to be successful. Monroe Doctrine, easement rights for the
<BR>
railroads, build up of an industrial base by both the North and South during
<BR>
the Civil War, tariffs in the latter 19th century protecting American
<BR>
manufactuers
<BR>
from foreign compeition, the electronics industry during and after WW2,
<BR>
space
<BR>
program, DARPA, etc, etc, etc. Why it is a slippery target because the
<BR>
result, if not intention, has been to is give private enterprise a running
<BR>
start by
<BR>
using its resources to get past the hardest, most costly part and then take
<BR>
it
<BR>
from there. In this way it can not provide a clear foil in the individualism
<BR>
vs.
<BR>
collectivism arguement as would comparison to the economic/social models
<BR>
of the Third Reich, Soviet Russia, ancient Egypt or feudal China.
<BR>
<P>What history says to me that individualistic or collectivistic societies and
<BR>
philosophies are premised on distorted perspectives of who and what
<BR>
human beings are. We are both social (collective) and individual so our
<BR>
societies need to reflect a similar balance which is no mean trick and not
<BR>
always successful, but it is none the less the most correct approch.
