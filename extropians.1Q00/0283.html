<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What this suggests to me is not a need for political action but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consideration of the possibility of private ownership of the requisite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology by an incorporation of Transhumanist interests. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reply that this leaves the possibility of expropriation by the State
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; open, I must agree.  But at what point do we desist from the pro-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; jection of possible impediments and get on with it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is being discussed.  It is also being examined from the framework of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how to deal with possible efforts by states to regulate the technologies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We must keep in mind that we are dealing with people who have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed with memes, the acceptence of which they generally did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have conscious awareness of.  So their &quot;agenda&quot; is potentially harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for both us *and* them.  We would be highly &quot;un&quot;-extropic if we were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take our toys and go play elsewhere if we could reasonably devote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some energy to &quot;free the minds&quot; of those individuals.
</EM><BR>
<P>[1] With respect to a program of public education involving e.g. a nation-
<BR>
wide speakers' bureau, free mutimedia downloads (even an Extropian
<BR>
Screensaver from the Institute), a media-relations department for the
<BR>
development of timely releases, propaganda and personal appearances,
<BR>
a Community Organization department to explore and expedite inter-
<BR>
group alliances based on mutual self-interest and resource-sharing and
<BR>
the availability of promotional materials using the Web as a distribution
<BR>
network combined with an appeal for new &quot;memberships&quot; and meaningful
<BR>
gifts and donations, such as trusts and endowments, and the develop-
<BR>
ment of what could be called an &quot;Advisory Board&quot;, &quot;Consultants&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;Contributing Scientists and Technologists&quot; etc. consisting of easily-
<BR>
recognized and prestigious individuals, and so on -- this would certainly
<BR>
be a desirable means of influencing public opinion without the hassle of
<BR>
forming a registered PAC or employing a lobbyist.  This latter is what I
<BR>
mean by &quot;political action&quot; -- anything less in my view is largely an exercise
<BR>
in futility.
<BR>
<P>[2] As a question for the Legal Department: Suppose &quot;Extropianism&quot; were
<BR>
redefined as a &quot;religion&quot;; what protections and advantages would this
<BR>
afford (at the price of some hypocrisy and double-think)?  I am not
<BR>
referring to mere tax exemptions, but to e.g. the ability of legislative
<BR>
bodies to impose constraints on practice without violating Church-State
<BR>
separation?
