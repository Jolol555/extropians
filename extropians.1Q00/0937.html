<BR>
If I was going to do this, I would use the Ken Thompson hack.
<BR>
<P>A Von Neumann machine is a compiler; it takes designs in at one end
<BR>
and translates them into a different form -- in this case, physical
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
<P>Ken Thompson -- inventor of UNIX -- did a very interesting hack in
<BR>
the early days, which effectively gave him root access to any UNIX
<BR>
system. The hack was self-propagating (it would migrate to new
<BR>
architectures when you ported UNIX to them), and was not visible in
<BR>
the source code. You can find his seminal paper on it (&quot;Reflections
<BR>
on trusting trust&quot;) at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~sanjiv/sys_sec/security/thompson/hack.html">http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~sanjiv/sys_sec/security/thompson/hack.html</A>
<BR>
<P>The Thompson hack works like this:
<BR>
<P>Say there is a program you want to compromise, which is created
<BR>
by a compiler. (An example: the UNIX login program invoked whenever
<BR>
a new user logs in. Purpose of corruption: to make it recognize
<BR>
a special password and give whoever enters it carte blanche on
<BR>
the system.) You hack the _compiler_ so that when it recognizes
<BR>
the source code for the login program, it inserts some extra code
<BR>
before compiling it. Thus, the source code for the login program is
<BR>
clean.
<BR>
<P>But there's more. You could in principle detect this hack by examining
<BR>
the source code for the compiler, right? Wrong. Because you apply
<BR>
the same hack to the compiler; you prepare source for a &quot;corrupt&quot; 
<BR>
compiler (which inserts the back door into the login program), and
<BR>
modify it so that it _also_ inserts an equivalent back door into the
<BR>
compiler -- one that detects compiler source code and inserts the
<BR>
back door. You then distribute a corrupted compiler binary, and
<BR>
clean source code for the compiler. When the unsuspecting user
<BR>
compiles the compiler against a new machine architecture, the output
<BR>
will propagate the back door ...
<BR>
<P>A similar hack can in principle be applied to Von Neumann machines (such
<BR>
as a Drexlerian household assembler). You ensure that if the machine
<BR>
is told to create certain items (berylium hemispheres, for example --
<BR>
tamber-pieces for nuclear weapons -- it goes ahead but also silently
<BR>
builds a cellular phone (or equivalent) and snitches to the nuclear
<BR>
weapons inspectorate. 
<BR>
<P>To this end, you'd load any commercially available assembler with a
<BR>
library of &quot;danger&quot; signs to watch out for. Tamber pieces, botulinum
<BR>
toxin, precursors for chemical weapons, that sort of thing. You'd
<BR>
also ensure that its design for replicating itself files some sort of
<BR>
registration with you whenever a user tells it to reproduce -- and this
<BR>
includes components of a Von Neumann machine that can be assembled
<BR>
later.
<BR>
<P>This hack doesn't prevent an assembler being used for nefarious
<BR>
purposes. However, it stops it being used *stupidly* for nefarious
<BR>
purposes -- if you want to use a domestic assembler to declare war on
<BR>
your neighbours, you either have to invent a wholly new weapon that
<BR>
won't set off the built-in snitch circuits, or you need to build your
<BR>
own &quot;clean&quot; assembler *from scratch*, without using components from a
<BR>
commercial assembler that may be contaminated by police Thompson hacks.
<BR>
Both of these are significantly more difficult operations than simply
<BR>
running off a couple of litres of Sarin.
<BR>
<P>For an added twist, we could make the police hack a meta-hack;
<BR>
instead of looking for one suspect behaviour, and replicating itself
<BR>
into any derived assemblers, the hack might check a public bulletin
<BR>
board for a whole range of suspect design items, and build additional
<BR>
recognizers into itself for each one. So unless you grow your assembler
<BR>
farm in a firewalled asteroid, it's going to be brought up to date on
<BR>
no-no forms of behaviour every time you add a node to it. (I'm assuming
<BR>
that the exponential growth capabilities of a Von Neumann machine will
<BR>
be of interest to anyone planning mega-havoc with one.)
<BR>
<P>Make looking for grey goop components an open source operation; you
<BR>
get kudos for coming up with a design template for something nasty
<BR>
*and submitting it to the police site*, from which new assemblers
<BR>
will grab it and configure themselves to snitch on anyone who tries
<BR>
to make one. &quot;Extra brownie points for submitting that alternate
<BR>
klystron design that those terrorists tried fabbing last week! Thanks
<BR>
to you, they didn't get their bomb finished before the police turned
<BR>
up with a search warrant. _And_ you made your neighbourhood safer.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the general direction will be &quot;non-tamperable&quot; assembler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boxes (i.e. if you open it, it turns into smelly sticky gloop)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and encrypted (and verified) designs.  So while the design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself is open source, it has to be verified, check-summed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encrypted and transmitted to the assembler by &quot;approved&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizations.  This is similar to the way that DVD's were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to work (until someone messed up and forgot to encrypt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the decoding keys in one vendor's product...).  The assemblers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (similar to the DVD players) will only assemble designs that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approved and untampered with.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I think this is too difficult. It suffers from the same problem as
<BR>
Microsoft's ActiveX components; anyone can write one, obtain a
<BR>
certificate, certify it as their own, and distribute it. If you can
<BR>
corrupt the certificate issuing authority and get your hands on a
<BR>
certificate, you can certify your design as 'clean' and wreak havoc
<BR>
with it. Thus, there's a single point of failure. Who will guard
<BR>
the guardians?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, the real trick will be creating some separation of power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between organizations, such as &quot;governments&quot; (who might want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control behaviors) or industry &quot;monopolists&quot; (such as the DVD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consortium) and the &quot;verification/approval/encryption&quot; organizations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Presumably you would want something like this done by some kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of non-profit foundation whose primary interest is in verifying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the designs are safe, not in regulating what people do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  You do not want to get into a situation where someone like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Natasha designs something but since it doesn't fit the paradigm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of how the &quot;powers&quot; want the society to look, she can't get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approvals required to get it assembled.  I suspect this will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end up looking a lot like the current drug approval processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (with a lot more engineering science).
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P>No organisations. No licenses.
<BR>
<P>Instead, make it a bottom-up process that is in the interests of
<BR>
sane individuals to contribute to. Take the best of the open source
<BR>
movement. People support and contribute to it because they get
<BR>
something back. Torvald's law applies: &quot;given an infinite number of
<BR>
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;. In this case, given an infinite
<BR>
number of eyeballs, all possible attempts to trick an assembler
<BR>
into building something really nasty can be anticipated and blocked.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe in the long run (20-30 years), if we get Minting and we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get some reasonable IA for design, you will get just about &quot;anything&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boxes.  The tough part may be getting some rare element (e.g.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gandolinium(?) for magnetic refrigerators) so there may still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be some interesting supply constraints.  But as always there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be alternate approaches and substitutions so these may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be strongly constraining.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm waiting for the Free Hardware Foundation -- the post-nanotech
<BR>
equivalent of the FSF. Same motives, same methods, same results.
<BR>
Why buy a Ford when you can customise your own GNU Automobile? Sure
<BR>
it won't be as stylish unless you make the effort to style it yourself,
<BR>
but it'll be a hell of a lot cheaper, and it'll be reliable, too. (I
<BR>
expect it will have all the aesthetic charm of a Humvee, with added
<BR>
solar power/coal/nuclear propulsion options -- but you have to paint
<BR>
it yourself.)
<BR>
<P>The big thing we can anticipate from assemblers is the commoditization
<BR>
of physical goods that are currently premium items. A lot of things we
<BR>
currently spend money on and invest with a sense of value will drop off 
<BR>
the map, insofar as they will stop being expensive or difficult to
<BR>
make. Think of the mutation of the book from mediaeval illuminated
<BR>
manuscript to battered paperback. This doesn't mean we don't have books
<BR>
any more -- we have many more than ever before -- but they don't cost
<BR>
six months' income or require hand-crafting on an individual basis.
<BR>
We already expect the cost of consumer electronics to fall, month on
<BR>
month; the same effect will hit other types of physical gadget once
<BR>
the nanotech revolution begins.
<BR>
<P>By 2030, we'll be thinking of a middle-class 1990's existence -- in
<BR>
material terms -- as being poverty-stricken. Because the real defining
<BR>
items of wealth will have moved away from manufactured goods; the
<BR>
emphasis will be on handicrafts, bespoke designs, and information.
