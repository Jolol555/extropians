</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Conservative columnist George Will writes today about the controversy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over using aborted fetus cells in stem cell research.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-01/20/110l-012000-idx.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-01/20/110l-012000-idx.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(That URL probably won't last long.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A disquieting era of genetic manipulation is coming, one that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; revolutionize human capacities, and notions of health. If we treat moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scruples impatiently, as inherently retrograde in a scientifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advancing civilization, we will not be in moral trim when--soon--our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very humanity depends on our being in trim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately Will takes up most of his space explaining the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controversy, without elaborating on his cryptic last paragraph.  What does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it mean to be in &quot;moral trim&quot;, such that our very humanity depends on it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One would think that the ability to turn mature cells into stem cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(what Will calls &quot;undifferentiated&quot; cells) would actually help with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moral dilemma.  There would no longer be a need to use aborted fetuses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for medical research or even medical therapy.  Right to lifers would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not have to balance the evil of promoting abortion against the good of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life-enhancing medical treatments from stem cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Will wrote last June about post-humanism in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.sacbee.com/voices/national/will/more/will_19990617.html">http://www.sacbee.com/voices/national/will/more/will_19990617.html</A>.  He is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a representative of &quot;old school&quot; conservatism (a conservative approach to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conservatism, as compared to the radical fire-breathing conservatives).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As such he may be a bridge between the extremists on the far right and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologists who are carrying us forward.

<P>Personally, I was wondering about the morality of scrounging a tissue sample 
<BR>
from one of my personal heroines - Heddy Lamar.  What a tragedy if no one 
<BR>
ever analyzed or cloned from her genes!  Also, it's really too bad, in 
<BR>
retrospect, now that I learn that she was financially poor off in her old 
<BR>
age, that I didn't follow thru in time on my idea of convincing her to 
<BR>
freeze some tissue.  I figured she must be rich and I would never get 
<BR>
through to her.  Turns out I probably could have.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that there are some investors savvy enought to realize that intact 
<BR>
DNA from Heddy will be worth a few cool $billion in ten to twenty years when 
<BR>
parents start seriously using cloning or selective chromosome replacement.  
<BR>
It's likely that a timely visit from some intelligent cryonicists could have 
<BR>
convinced her to make a deal - health care and the top of the line liquid 
<BR>
nitrogen coffin when the health care didn't take any longer, in exchange for 
<BR>
enough tissue samples or maybe eggs (are eggs any good in women of advanced 
<BR>
age?).
<BR>
Heddy had just the right techno-friendly, iconoclastic, live for the day 
<BR>
attitude throughout her life to have thought it a great lark at worst.
<BR>
<P>If anyone out there has friends or connections to the Florida DA or coroner, 
<BR>
this might be the time to ask for a favor or a tour...  Even dusting around 
<BR>
the Lamar house or car or yard might make your fortune.  But hurry!!  (I'll 
<BR>
happily take a small gratuity - say .5% of the profits for making the 
<BR>
suggestion.)
