What other &quot;take&quot; could there be, unless we vastly expand the scope of our

inquiry to include putative extraterrestrial cultures?  Why should any

belief-system be treated as a problem? While the Zen I practice is, I 
<BR>
suppose you could say, both adeistic and atheistic, the vision of a 
<BR>
post-human existence found within any of these systems is never an 
<BR>
infringement of my own views. I respect every religion for what in principle 
<BR>
it is -- a guide to character-formation and value-definition, a consolation 
<BR>
for grief, a rational basis for hope. Yes, RATIONAL.  It is totally illicit 
<BR>
for non-religious rationalists to attempt to adopt a stance superior to 
<BR>
theists by depriving them of rationality.  Regards, Bob

<P>Robert, thank you for putting so well into words the value of religion in 
<BR>
human lives.  You can say things so much better then I can.  Religion can be 
<BR>
a healthy and powerful structure to achieve mental discipline and try to 
<BR>
reach out to something greater then oneself.  It can be toxic though if 
<BR>
misapplied, as even Christian therapists will say in books like &quot;Toxic 
<BR>
Faith&quot; which can be found at your local Christian bookseller.
<BR>
<P>I see the point Zero and others make about the dangers of scientific 
<BR>
research being slowed or stopped by fundamentalists (of all types and 
<BR>
stripes) but it is wrong to lump together abortion clinic bombers with 
<BR>
mainstream Christians who abhor murder and terrorism.
<BR>
<P>I should have known my little post would have sparked something!  I enjoyed 
<BR>
Brent Allsop's post and saw the point he was making.  I suppose I am one of 
<BR>
the few actual believers in God and an afterlife on this list.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
