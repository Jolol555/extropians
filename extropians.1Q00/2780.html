Scale the cells up to the size of your living room after you've let a dozen 
<BR>
4 year olds have a free hand with it for a couple of hours.  Is
<BR>
there anything there that you can't put back in order, patch
<BR>
or replace if its truly broken?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I love the analogy.  Four year-old kids are the destructive equivalent of 
<BR>
cell fracturing from freezing!! lol  But the analogy could be flawed in that 
<BR>
there still may be much more about the nature of memory that we don't know.  
<BR>
I am happy to hear that the quantum theory about memory seems to be false.  
<BR>
I look forward to you reading the Mike Darwin paper even though it is 
<BR>
somewhat dated(1994).
<BR>
<P>Believe me, I want to be totally on your side of things but this is my 
<BR>
life(and memories) we are talking about and that of every other cryonicist.  
<BR>
Saul Kent and Charles Platt are not so convinced and will be doing 
<BR>
fundraising down the road for a new brain suspension research project.
<BR>
<P>Already, the current 21st Century Medicine breakthoughs are really 
<BR>
incredible!  Charles Platt wrote about them in detail in the &quot;Cryonics&quot; 
<BR>
magazine.  It is a huge leap forward in terms of controlling the damage from 
<BR>
freezing and yet the problem seems to be getting these techniques adopted by 
<BR>
the cryonics organizations out there.  For the next person who is 
<BR>
cryonically suspended, they should be implemented as soon as possible!  I'm 
<BR>
not sure what the snags are stopping this.
<BR>
