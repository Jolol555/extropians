<BR>
<P>Researchers have shown that cells can be &quot;trained&quot; to grow, one by one, along 
<BR>
a chemical trail. 
<BR>
<P>This feat, conducted at Nottingham University, in the UK, is an important 
<BR>
step towards the goal of growing all tissues to order in the lab. 
<BR>
<P>One day scientists believe they will be able persuade nerve cells to grow 
<BR>
again to repair spinal injuries. It might even be possible to take cells from 
<BR>
your bloodstream and coax them into growing a new organ for transplantation. 
<BR>
<P>These are just two of the tantalising possibilities that are envisioned for 
<BR>
the interdisciplinary science of cell engineering. Scientists are anxious to 
<BR>
stress that it will be many years into the future before any such advances 
<BR>
are realised. 
<BR>
<P>But understanding of the body's most basic units is increasing at a rapid 
<BR>
rate and it is not unreasonable to think that we could build organs and other 
<BR>
structures with cells in the same way that we build somewhat larger 
<BR>
structures with bricks and girders. 
<BR>
<P>Synthetic materials
<BR>
<P>Dr Kevin Shakesheff, of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Nottingham, 
<BR>
told BBC News Online: &quot;Our own bodies are achieving amazing feats in 
<BR>
materials production every day. They produce materials that are far more 
<BR>
complex and perfectly formed than any current synthetic materials.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Dr Shakesheff is finding out how cells work by redesigning the extra-cellular 
<BR>
matrix, the scaffold that surrounds the cells and acts like a 'glue' to stick 
<BR>
the cells together. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Our own cells produce a natural scaffold that provides a support structure 
<BR>
that holds tissues together. It is a complex mixture of biological molecules 
<BR>
that are organised into fibres and networks.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Not only is this scaffold a remarkable mechanical structure, it also 
<BR>
transmits data as well. &quot;Incredibly, this structure not only supports the 
<BR>
cells but also signals to them, telling them how to repair damaged regions,&quot; 
<BR>
the Nottingham researcher said. 
<BR>
<P>Experimenting with cells, Dr Shakesheff and his colleagues have been able 
<BR>
show that they will line up along a chemical trail laid on a flat surface, 
<BR>
even when the trail is only as wide as a single cell. It is, believe the 
<BR>
researchers, just the beginning. 
<BR>
<P>Donor shortages
<BR>
<P>&quot;Being able to grow organs would mean we could be much more efficient in our 
<BR>
use of animal tissue in research. For example, if we could take one liver and 
<BR>
engineer the cells so that it would form 1000 identical mini-livers in the 
<BR>
laboratory, we could use small amounts of tissue to test thousands of drug 
<BR>
molecules. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Ultimately, it would be wonderful to be able to take one donated human liver 
<BR>
and grow many engineered livers. Then we could overcome the problem of donor 
<BR>
shortages for liver transplantation.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Artificial organs grown using cell engineering are in the future. But before 
<BR>
that cell engineering is already providing some benefits for patients. Skin 
<BR>
grown in the lab is already available and used to treat burns victims or to 
<BR>
aid the healing of ulcers. 
<BR>
<P>In the US, it has been possible to repair cartilage, a simple tissue that 
<BR>
contains only one type of cell and no blood vessels. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's exciting to work at the interface between biology and materials 
<BR>
science,&quot; Dr Shakesheff said.
