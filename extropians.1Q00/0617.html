<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;One of the things I try to do when I write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  techno/drum'n'bass is to look for such alternative ways to structure the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  composition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I would be delighted to hear this, it sounds like you know a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things and have a lot of trix up yoru sleeve...
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a few tracks up at <A HREF="http://www.mp3.com/digitalcutuplounge">http://www.mp3.com/digitalcutuplounge</A>, just a taste of
<BR>
the breakbeat CD I'm working on.  I'm trying to integrate fragments of live
<BR>
improvisation into a digital cut-and-paste context.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's odd, but I don't think of DJ'ing as being particularly an original art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form, usually it's a lot of snatching things from here and there and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combining them in new ways...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... it's gotten me curious to hear you defend &quot;new&quot; sounds...
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me that the importance of DJing as an art form is a consequence of
<BR>
the general acceleration of life and the accompanying massive increase in
<BR>
CHOICE...there's so much music out there now, how can we make sense of it all?
<BR>
A good DJ makes an artistic statement by his/her selections, asserting that what
<BR>
he/she is playing is good new music -- the biggest challenge is to keep finding
<BR>
new music that is good and also that fits together coherently, not to mention
<BR>
sequencing the records in a good order such that there is some kind of narrative
<BR>
flow to the course of a whole evening of music.
<BR>
<P>(NOTE:  I'm a pro bassist who started DJing [spinning mp3s on a Mac PowerBook]
<BR>
relatively recently because it seems more creative to me than playing live.)
<BR>
<P>I used to be a member of this list too, BTW, but that was quite awhile ago, in
<BR>
1994 to be exact, wonder how many people are still on here from that time?
