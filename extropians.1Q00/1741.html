<P><EM> &gt; &gt; We first need a good water model. I haven't modelled freezing in large
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; volumes (it's on my todo list), but purportedly the freezing point is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; totally off-key.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Please explain.  (If it will take too much space here, please email me
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; directly.)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The freezing point in machina is far from ~273 K. Of course it could be
<BR>
microdroplet supercooling, but one find that out by seeding the volume
<BR>
with an ice nucleus. As I said, I haven't tried it out yet.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Virtual screening is very new, and requires a lot of resources, both
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; in terms of hardware and manpower.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; But genetic algorithmns have been around since, at least, the early 1970s.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; If one could start with a simple model -- one that hardly works -- and just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; build on it, I bet this could be done a lot quicker.  We don't need
</EM><BR>
<P>Structure generation is more or less trivial. You can generate
<BR>
hundreds to thousands of structures per second. Screening them
<BR>
virtually is much more difficult, especially if things go beyond
<BR>
&quot;mere&quot; docking. Freezing in presence of cryoprotectantcs is probably
<BR>
synergistic (the cryoprotectant influences the ice structure and the
<BR>
growth mechanisms). If you assume it isn't, you might produce
<BR>
garbage. Off the top of my head, a virtual screening run with
<BR>
simulated freezing with current hardware (64 node Beowulf cluster) can
<BR>
take around a week for a single candidate. Maybe more than a week.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; perfection here.  After all, this would only act as an input into actual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; physical testing.  The searches coudl act to weed out more bad
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;only&quot;? The computer suggests a structure. You can't buy it, so you
<BR>
make a literature search (if you're lucky, you can find a procedure,
<BR>
order the chemicals, and hopefully synthesize the thing in a few
<BR>
weeks). If not, you have to develop a synthesis route first. Then you
<BR>
have to purify it, and test it. (Testing can be done in a half a day).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Cryobiology is but a tiny subfied of a subfield, counting about 200
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; practitioners world-wide, most of them past their prime. Molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; modelling is hence slow to enter the field.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I can understand, but that also means no one else is probably doing the work
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there, so you need not fear competitors for a while.  You'll be the pioneer.
</EM><BR>
<P>You still need the resources, and the manpower.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Also, cryobiology is not the only field I mentioned.  Antiaging research is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the other.  What of that?  If one can develop a good model of aging at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cellular or molecular level, then finding new ways to combat it would seem
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to me to be a lot easier.  From the looks of it, it appears most research in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this area is identify a mechanism, find something that inhibits it, look for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; similar things to that inhibitor, and so forth.  Am I right?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; A simulated aging cell could be used to more efficiently search for aging
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; inhibitors and therapies, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>We cannot even fold proteins yet. Virtual cell at molecular resolution 
<BR>
is future technology.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Specifically, I'd like to know how people come up with ideas for new
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cryoprotectants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Educated guess, blind trial and error, and rational design. A little
<BR>
bit of everything. You can also go for combinatorial chemistry and
<BR>
evolution in vitro.
