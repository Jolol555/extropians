<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Since I'm a functionalist, I'd agree that we could experience the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same things with functionally-equivalent but physically different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, talking about emotions is much to complex or &quot;squishy&quot;
<BR>
or hard to pin down.  I prefer something much simpler and more precise
<BR>
like the color red, or the taste of salt.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of these is we have, today, simple machines
<BR>
that can resolve color far more accurately (and perceive much more of
<BR>
the electromagnetic spectrum) than we can.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I can't accept the &quot;functionalist&quot; position is that
<BR>
it seams that the functionalist is arguing that the paint color
<BR>
machine at the local hard ware store, since it is color wise, much
<BR>
more than I am, color wise.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times the functionalists seems to try to pull the
<BR>
argument back into the complexity, emotional, &quot;squishy&quot; stuff and
<BR>
argues that since we do more stuff like &quot;wiggle&quot; more when we see red
<BR>
while a paint machine doesn't do these kinds of things, the machine is
<BR>
less than we are.  But I think this is a categorical error and missing
<BR>
the entire point of all this.  Everyone seems sidtracked with all this
<BR>
stuff that is completely unrelated to the real issue.  I think the
<BR>
color machine is, as far as this discussion is concerned, far more
<BR>
&quot;intelligent&quot; or far more capable of &quot;knowing&quot; than we are.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more than this, I believe that all &quot;wiggles&quot;, or all
<BR>
other &quot;emotional&quot; differences can be functionally &quot;modeled&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;represented&quot; with any sufficiently complex abstract representation.
<BR>
So, in a way I am a functionalist.  I will argue with anyone that a
<BR>
paint machine, color wise, is more functional than we are, color wise.
<BR>
But, I argue very strongly that, for the paint machine's
<BR>
representations, that are abstract, it doesn't matter what they are
<BR>
&quot;like&quot;.  But to me, my representation of &quot;red&quot; is most definitely like
<BR>
something, and if you use any other physical phenomenon to represent
<BR>
&quot;red&quot; knowledge, you can accomplish similar things functionally, but
<BR>
it is most definitely not the same.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What else do you think emotions are?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think emotions are complex sets of qualia.  I believe that
<BR>
Scientific observation of &quot;brain stuff&quot; to date has only been
<BR>
concerned with abstract &quot;cause and effect&quot; of the chemistry that is
<BR>
going on.  I.E. we're only interested in it's abstract &quot;functional&quot;
<BR>
behavior.  But this is entirely missing the whole point of what
<BR>
consciousness, emotions... really are and what they are phenomenally
<BR>
like.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we turn our science to start looking for more than just
<BR>
the &quot;function&quot; of this electrochemical phenomenon inside our brain,
<BR>
when we start looking for what it is like, that is when we will
<BR>
discover what &quot;emotions&quot; really are.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of this is being able to eff.  What does
<BR>
&quot;ineffible&quot; mean to a &quot;functionalist&quot;?  To me, the important thing
<BR>
will be when a color detecting machine can say: &quot;Oh that's what red or
<BR>
salty, or... is like&quot;.  Since we will really know what red is, we will
<BR>
know if it is lying or not.  (Today's abstract machines would
<BR>
obviously be lying since it would simply look up and produce the
<BR>
response from some abstract table rather than honestly saying it is
<BR>
really experiencing red and now knows what it is like.)  I think that
<BR>
when science finally discoverers what red is like and why it is like
<BR>
that, this will give us the ability to engineer effing abilities.  Do
<BR>
any functionallist care about being able to eff qualia, emotions, and
<BR>
so on and so forth?  Rather than do this, Dennett and others seems to
<BR>
just argue that they don't exist, and therefore it doesn't matter?
<BR>
Just give the paint machine a few more &quot;wiggles&quot; or whatever and it
<BR>
will be the same?  This doesn't seem right to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm curious since I'm currently discussing this very topic in two of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my classes right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool, what classes are these?
