<BR>
<EM>&gt;As Max pointed out, the scientific term is &quot;negentropy&quot;.  It comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up alot in Robert's study of the evolution of life, &quot;Xenology&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is likely that J.R. meant this, since &quot;extropy&quot; doesn't really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come into the picture until Max created it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like to think of extropy as the opposite of entropy because of the linguistic
<BR>
symetry involved. It parallels the construction of /exit/ and /entrance/ as
<BR>
opposites. In his 1994 book _Out of Control_, Kevin Kelly writes, &quot;They are not
<BR>
sure what they are looking for, but they intuitively feel that it can be stated
<BR>
as a complementary force to entropy. Some cll it anti-entropy, some call it
<BR>
negentropy, and a few call it extropy.&quot; (p.405)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the same book, &quot;In the 1950s, the physicist Erwin Schrodinger called the
</EM><BR>
life force &quot;negentropy&quot; to indicate its opposite direction from the push of
<BR>
thermal decay. In the 1990s, an embryonic subculture of technocrats thriving in
<BR>
the US calls the life force 'extropy.'&quot; (p.106)
<BR>
<P>Of course, it really doesn't matter what you call it. &quot;A rose by any other
<BR>
name,&quot; and so on. I only invoked the term extropy in answer to Robert Owen's
<BR>
question, &quot;Why are we not all bacteria?&quot; because I think the constellation of
<BR>
concepts called extropy addresses this question better than any other approach
<BR>
I've found.
