<EM>&gt; &gt; Tell me please the last time a US citizens militia killed anyone? Hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  happend yet, no matter what their political beleifs. Go point your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  paranoia someplace that matters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Timothy MacVeigh, &amp; Bufford whatever the fuck his last name is, from last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; summer, all the nice little klan boys calling themselves militia members. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; militia paranoids having no trouble breaking a ration-pack with those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puss-bags. If the &quot;militias' don't seem to discriminate regarding klan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allegience, why need I?
</EM><BR>
<P>because you are wrong. McVeigh was thrown out of a militia meeting
<BR>
because of his views, and he was never a member. Buford was a nazi, not
<BR>
a militia member. So your problem with militia people is that they DONT
<BR>
discriminate? So if they discriminated, it would be ok with you? Make UP
<BR>
YOUR MIND.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Don't know. Logic dictates that if they kill of all the 'mud people'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that they won't have anyone to hate anymore and they'll have to get real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;beleifs and ethics. I'm sure they don't want that to happen, just like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the anti-nukers don't want us to solve the problem of getting rid of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nuclear waste, and the greenhouse effect protesters don't want us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;solve the problem with nuclear power. Eliminate the problem and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whiners have to get real jobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope they wannabe the new SS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who, the greenies? I beleive it.
