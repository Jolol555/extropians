</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowing how much China knows, seeing as how the Orient looks to be the

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very interesting comments.  As I understand, the Japanese government and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; academia saw the promise in nanotech long before the United States did and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funded appropriately.  And so a hidden major reason for the Clinton 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; administration's generous funding of nano research is to deal with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foreign competition!  Competition can be a good thing, eh?
</EM><BR>
<P>Also, they realise they need technology to stay alive - the Home
<BR>
Islands are resource-poor, with a rapidly aging population and
<BR>
dependent on overseas resources. Anything that can make them more
<BR>
efficient, self-sufficient and able to uphold their high standard of
<BR>
living will be pursued. On the other hand, my impression of Japanese
<BR>
research is that it is often either very applied or very blue sky
<BR>
visionary; it seems there is a gap in the middle that might seriously
<BR>
hinder development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do also worry about China.  I hope they can learn to live peaceably with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rest of their global neighbors.  I think of China like an adolescent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; male who was pushed around alot by neighborhood bullies who have since grown 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up and matured emotionally.  But the victim of this is still carrying a big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grudge and wants to kick some butt to prove his place in the neighborhood.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question is, can we guide this lad of one billion people to that state 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of societal maturity without a major hot or cold war??
</EM><BR>
<P>Neighbourhood bully? China is much more than somebody who has been
<BR>
bullied by stronger neighbours - for most of its history it has been
<BR>
the reverse. I think *that* is the problem - as long as the Beijing
<BR>
government see themselves as rulers of an Empire with a manifest
<BR>
destiny to be great, they will collide with everyone else. Note the
<BR>
tremendous benefits Japan or Germany (or Sweden in the 16th century
<BR>
for that matter) have reaped from turning the energy spent on
<BR>
nationalist expansionism into other pursuits.
<BR>
<P>As for China, I don't know. On one hand it has such tremendous
<BR>
potential, a booming economy, many cultural memes which could work
<BR>
well with transhumanism and sheer size to become the major power of
<BR>
this century. But on the other hand, it could break down if the
<BR>
Beijing people cannot handle the transition, and then we get a Balkan
<BR>
with a billion people involved.
