The Politics of Mental Illness
<BR>
What media attacks on the Surgeon General’s report didn’t tell you
<BR>
By Maia Szalavitz
<BR>
<P>December 28, 1999
<BR>
<P>When the Surgeon General issued a report saying that 50 percent of Americans
<BR>
will suffer a mental illness at some point in their lives, the reaction of the
<BR>
media and many pundits reflected the moral judgment and prejudice which still
<BR>
surrounds the issue and which the report itself was trying to fight. Ignoring
<BR>
the hundreds of pages of research in the report, pundits preferred to focus on
<BR>
the idea that psychiatrists are &quot;defining mental illness down&quot; to help their
<BR>
friends in the pharmaceutical industry.
<BR>
<P>Psychiatrist Sally Satel, writing in The New York Times on Dec. 15, complained
<BR>
that the report would lead more people with &quot;minor&quot; mental illnesses to seek
<BR>
help and that this would compromise efforts to force the seriously ill into
<BR>
care.
<BR>
<P>Letters from other psychiatrists printed over the following few days strongly
<BR>
attacked Satel. Bipolar disease expert and sufferer Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison
<BR>
asked on Dec. 17 whether Satel would write an editorial supporting physicians in
<BR>
ignoring patients with &quot;mild&quot; cases of diabetes, heart disease or cancer?
<BR>
<P>And there's the nub of the issue: While no one would find it at all remarkable
<BR>
if the Surgeon General said that one in five people would suffer heart disease
<BR>
or cancer at some point during the year, when the issue is the mind and brain,
<BR>
Americans seem to expect lifelong, perfect health.
<BR>
<P>This makes little sense when you consider that the brain is the most complex
<BR>
organ in the body (in fact, it is the most complex object in the known
<BR>
universe). Why should it be any less prone to difficulty than the colon, stomach
<BR>
or heart? Why should we expect to suffer numerous physical illnesses in the
<BR>
course of a normal life, but never mental problems? And why shouldn't we treat
<BR>
the distress caused by them?
<BR>
<P>Prejudice against believing in mental illness runs through media coverage of
<BR>
psychiatric drugs and their increasing role in medicine. From George Will on the
<BR>
right to Alexander Cockburn on the left, there have been numerous attacks on the
<BR>
use of Ritalin for ADD and Prozac and its sisters for depression. Typical
<BR>
headlines include &quot;Drugging Unruly Kids Lazy Parents' Cop Out&quot; (USA Today
<BR>
12/17/99), &quot;Ease up on Ritalin and Let Boys be Boys,&quot;(The Houston Chronicle,
<BR>
headlining Will's column, December 7, 1999) or &quot;Would Tom Sawyer Have been
<BR>
Prescribed Ritalin?&quot; (The San Francisco Chronicle, 3/18/99).
<BR>
<P>The columns and articles represent a notion that because these drugs are being
<BR>
prescribed more than before, they are being over-prescribed. &quot;Spirited&quot; active
<BR>
children are being made into zombies, they charge. Non-depressives are rushing
<BR>
to take Prozac to improve their personalities, while parents are pushing naughty
<BR>
kids onto Ritalin rather than trying discipline.
<BR>
<P>The problem is, there is little data to back this notion, other than an increase
<BR>
in prescribing - which could just as easily reflect greater awareness that there
<BR>
is help for widely prevalent conditions. In response to Will's claims about ADD
<BR>
in The Washington Post, the President of the American Academy for Child
<BR>
Psychiatry, wrote that epidemiological studies find that 3-10% of school age
<BR>
children have some form of ADD. About 3% are currently in treatment, well within
<BR>
the range of appropriate prescribing and far less than the figure (of unknown
<BR>
origin) cited by Will of 10-12% of boys being on Ritalin.
<BR>
<P>With depression, epidemiological studies find that most people actually don't
<BR>
seek treatment. When depressives finally agree to try drugs, it is often after a
<BR>
long and fruitless attempt to &quot;snap out of it&quot; on their own or with talk
<BR>
therapy. This is especially true of Ritalin. The stigma placed on those who
<BR>
&quot;drug their kids&quot; is so great (as those headlines clearly indicate) that even
<BR>
parents of children with the most severe and obvious disorders try everything
<BR>
from diets to behavior modification before even agreeing to a brief test of
<BR>
medication. Hence, the need for the Surgeon General's report.
<BR>
<P>But why is the notion that &quot;people with mental illnesses short of schizophrenia
<BR>
are malingerers&quot; still such a part of the assumptions many journalists make when
<BR>
covering stories such as the Surgeon General's report?
<BR>
<P>For one, it fits ideological agendas of both the left and the right. On the
<BR>
right, syndicated columnist George Will can use the issue to point to the need
<BR>
for more parental responsibility and discipline, and less feminist interference
<BR>
with &quot;boys being boys.&quot; On the left, Alexander Cockburn can show that
<BR>
pharmaceutical companies and their capitalist cronies make big bucks by pushing
<BR>
these drugs on kids and destroying their individuality.
<BR>
<P>And there is another player with a big investment in fighting the treatment of
<BR>
the mentally ill - the Church of Scientology, which believes that all of
<BR>
psychiatry is mind control.
<BR>
<P>But if there were a rash of over-prescribing drugs like Prozac and Ritalin,
<BR>
surely some enterprising journalist could come up with anecdotes about parents
<BR>
who put their kids on Ritalin at the first sign of &quot;acting out,&quot; or
<BR>
non-depressives who used Prozac to boost their chances of success at dating or
<BR>
at work?
<BR>
<P>Read the stories, or search for such cases, and you come up dry.
<BR>
<P>The few anecdotes that do surface, however, almost always come from
<BR>
organizations affiliated with the Church of Scientology or from experts who,
<BR>
while not affiliated with the Church itself, take its position that all
<BR>
psychiatric medication is poison, and serve as expert witnesses when the Church
<BR>
sues drug companies.Yet when the national media picks up local stories based on
<BR>
Scientology-introduced information, the role of the Church tends to be ignored.
<BR>
<P>A perfect example is the recent decision of a Colorado School Board to pass a
<BR>
resolution to discourage teachers from suggesting medication for children with
<BR>
behavior problems. In the wake of Columbine, the Scientology-affiliated
<BR>
Citizen's Committee for Human Rights (CCHR )sent a brochure to a school board
<BR>
member describing the correlation between Prozac and other psychiatric drug use
<BR>
and violence. Since one Columbine shooter was known to have been on the
<BR>
antidepressant Luvox, the board member thought the issue worthy of
<BR>
consideration.
<BR>
<P>Although courts have never found in favor of those claiming that these drugs
<BR>
cause violence, it is easy to see how the media could continue to give weight to
<BR>
the idea. If several of the school shooters were taking antidepressants, perhaps
<BR>
this is what set them off? But distinguishing correlation from causation has
<BR>
never been a strong point in the media.
<BR>
<P>The Colorado Board decided to hold a hearing on the subject. They invited a
<BR>
representative from CCHR and Dr. Peter Breggin, an anti-psychiatric medication
<BR>
psychiatrist who has written books such as &quot;Your drug may be your problem&quot; and
<BR>
<P>&quot;Talking back to Ritalin.&quot; No parents testified that their kids had been forced
<BR>
by teachers to take drugs—in fact, there was no testimony from experts (by far
<BR>
the majority of psychiatrists) or anyone else on the other side, according to
<BR>
The Denver Post. The paper's editorial on Nov. 14 opposed the resolution saying
<BR>
that board members, &quot;might as well spend their time trying to outlaw seat
<BR>
belts - which dramatically reduce deaths and injuries suffered in traffic
<BR>
accidents but cannot totally eliminate them.&quot;
<BR>
<P>When the story of the Denver board resolution hit the national and even
<BR>
international press, the role of Scientology-affiliates in setting off and
<BR>
shaping the debate was not mentioned.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, a major study of Ritalin for ADD was published in the Archives of
<BR>
General Psychiatry. It found the drug superior to behavioral treatments alone
<BR>
and to standard treatments used in various communities and schools. Adding
<BR>
behavioral therapy to Ritalin didn't improve its efficacy: The only children
<BR>
helped by this approach were those who had additional problems beyond ADD.
<BR>
<P>It didn't provoke any editorials.
