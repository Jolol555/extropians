<EM>&gt;&gt;I believe you *are* a pioneer.  I am sure that in 20-30 years when &gt;&gt;the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;viability of strong AI and nanotech start to become evident to &gt;&gt;the world 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;at large, folks will look back to the archived writings &gt;&gt;and web pages of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;some of the people on this list and say &quot;hey, &gt;&gt;those freaks were right 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;all along!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I had that experience in Russia, where the dissidents were right all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;along, and for years were not just disbelieved, but in the best cased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dismissed and shun, and more often than not, persecuted, and living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fear and poverty.   Now everybody knows they were right all along,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but nobody even concentrates on this.  People - the healthy, unscared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;persecutors and the rest of the crowd who were busy making money and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contacts and having fun while the &quot;pioneers&quot; were bleeding for common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future - now these people own all the results, and they never pay to,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;write about, or think of the dissidents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How many of the Internet billionaires are talking, writing, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supporting pioneers of the Web and cryptography?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How many times in your life do you hear: &quot;You were right all along.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We were dumb.  Now, please have our money&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know some aging Russian dissidents in Boston who are still discussing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who was right when, over tea with cheap cakes bought on foodstamps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nobody else ever listens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I am for practicism now.  There is little point lamenting that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world is ungrateful.  Not as the main method of self-gratification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyway.   If you are a pioneer, make sure you can benefit from it too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or if you are an unselfish pioneer, be prepared to be forgotten.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you.  It won't make a hill of beans to me whether I am 
<BR>
remembered as a &quot;pioneer&quot; for advocating some Extropian ideas before it 
<BR>
became cool.  But since we (unless like most) anticipate that we will, one 
<BR>
way or another, make it to the era of indefinite human life span, we can 
<BR>
(and do) prepare for it now.
<BR>
<P>Some of my friends treat their brain as if it doesn't matter all that much.  
<BR>
In their minds all they need it to do is last in fairly usable shape until 
<BR>
they're about 70 years old and then they won't need it anymore.  I (like 
<BR>
many on this list I would imagine) on the other hand, realize that my brain 
<BR>
is my single most valuable possession.  I also realize that I may be in need 
<BR>
of its services for hundreds of years.  So I treat it that way, making sure 
<BR>
it gets adequate regular exercise (use it or lose it), and protecting it 
<BR>
from the harmful effects of alcohol and drug abuse.
<BR>
<P>That is a real, tangible, immediate benefit of adopting Extropian concepts 
<BR>
now.  You realize that your brain is a valuable tool that you may need to 
<BR>
get use out of for a very, very long time.
<BR>
