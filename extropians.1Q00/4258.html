<EM>&gt;From: Robert Owen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rowen@technologist.com?Subject=Re:%20Explaining%20Mind%20II&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000307040440.15441.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">rowen@technologist.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Summing up one position I happen to endorse:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Mind&quot; is the origin of &quot;thoughts&quot; or intrapsychic conceptual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;structures. It is possible to focus attention of the &quot;thought&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OF &quot;Mind&quot;, but since &quot;Mind&quot; qua &quot;Mind&quot; is not a &quot;thought&quot; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannot be a constituent of any cognitive experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For this reason, it cannot as such be designated by any term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a description of experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The word &quot;Mind&quot; is simply used to designate the necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and sufficient Reason for the experience of thoughts. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this sense it is a logical construct, and it is unnecessary to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argue about whether &quot;Mind&quot; exists or not. It is an explanatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;principle, and as such inexplicable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the Buddhists deal with it fairly well.  In Buddhist thought 
<BR>
*nothing* can be precisely described by human language, simply because 
<BR>
language is an attempt to describe immediate subjective experience using an 
<BR>
obliquely shared set of symbolic verbal constructs.
<BR>
<P>The term &quot;foot&quot; may suffice for everyday conversation such as to convey 
<BR>
experiences such as &quot;my foot hurts.&quot;  But the word &quot;foot&quot; does not 
<BR>
necessarily mean the same thing to all people.  To you does &quot;foot&quot; emcompass 
<BR>
toes?  How about the ankle?  If so, how far up?  Where exactly does the foot 
<BR>
end and the leg begin?  In actuality there is no such thing as a foot.  
<BR>
There are human bodies and in our Western scientific tradition we attempt to 
<BR>
dissect the whole into its constituent parts for purposes of measurement and 
<BR>
analysis.  But even the &quot;standards&quot; we use to measure with are, ultimately, 
<BR>
artificial semantic constructs of human language.
<BR>
<P>If such &quot;problems&quot; present themselves in the attempt to define a foot, I 
<BR>
don't suppose there is much use in trying to define &quot;mind&quot; in any 
<BR>
transcendent (or even precisely accurate scientific) sense.
<BR>
<P>Om.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
