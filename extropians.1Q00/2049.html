john grigg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Societal%20Stagnation&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000204205358.46671.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">starman125@hotmail.com</A>&gt; offered the following:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The other day I talked to a friend about these things.  We got on the topic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of immortality and she said what bothered her most was the &gt;idea of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultural stagnation which I think is the largest problem a &gt;world of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immortals would have.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;p&gt;First I do not see this as a problem.  I believe that society moves 
<BR>
toward what its constituents desire, regardless of whether the &quot;old guard&quot; 
<BR>
die off in droves.  I think all on this list would agree that cultural 
<BR>
evolution is driven by the evolution of memes, which evolve much faster than 
<BR>
the genes which drive biological evolution.  And memes don't need new people 
<BR>
in order to evolve any more than genes need new physical environments in 
<BR>
which to evolve.  It seems clear that the ebbing of the last ice age gave a 
<BR>
boost to human evolution by clearing the way for environmental conditions 
<BR>
favorable to our survival.  But I don't think we need another major 
<BR>
environmental shift to prevent us from biologically stagnating.
<BR>
<P>&lt;p&gt;Its the same with memes.  Think of the memes which were prevalent when 
<BR>
you were born.  When I was born the various memes which made it cool to 
<BR>
smoke cigarettes and OK to rape the environment in the name of industry, to 
<BR>
discriminate against minorities, women and gays, to build up ever increasing 
<BR>
nuclear arsenals, to have the FBI conduct its COINTELPRO operation against 
<BR>
groups like the black panthers, AIM and to conduct illegal surveillance of 
<BR>
American &quot;radicals&quot; like Martin Luther King were all alive and flourishing.  
<BR>
Today, within the span of my life, those memes are dying fast, if not dead 
<BR>
already.
<BR>
<P>&lt;p&gt;More importantly, in the future memes will be propagated by 
<BR>
superintelligences and will most likely derive from advances in science and 
<BR>
technology rather than the irrational personal preferences or beliefs of the 
<BR>
members of society.  Thus, at least until we reach the singularity, neither 
<BR>
science nor technology will stagnate, and neither will memes or society, 
<BR>
regardless of whether the constituents of society are immortal.  As with any 
<BR>
singularity though, once you get past it there's no telling what will 
<BR>
happen.
<BR>
<P>&lt;p&gt;Zero
