<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@www.aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20God's%20indifference%20to%20suffering?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000309050445.37191.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bradbury@www.aeiveos.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2 questions for discussion:  If pain and suffering did not exist, might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complacency keep us from creating?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Huh?  Why do you think suffering promotes creation?  While I'm sure there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are &quot;suffering&quot; artists, there are those that are &quot;joyful&quot; as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well lets not be so quick to shoot down the idea.  After all necessity is 
<BR>
the mother of invention.  The absence of suffering is also the absence of 
<BR>
need.  I think the argument is truer when dealing with practical creativity 
<BR>
(or invention) than mere whimsy or emotional self-expression.  Although I 
<BR>
suppose that even artistic expression is the product of the artist's need to 
<BR>
translate the conversation of his soul into the tangible language of art so 
<BR>
as to hopefully find a sympathetic soul with whom to share the conversation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly, HOW MUCH pain and suffering would be the minimum that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligent species would need, to be motivated to create?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If we assume Dolphins are intelligent, they rarely have experiences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;involving &quot;pain and suffering&quot; (most commonly accidentally imposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by humans in one way or another), yet they would appear to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very creative species.  I think intelligent species create for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<P>What leads you to believe Dophins are creative?  What on Earth has a Dolphin 
<BR>
ever created?  I'm totally lost on that one.
<BR>

<P>&quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;
