<EM>&gt; There is a proposition that all creative processes have natural selection as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an underlying mechanism: 1. Mutation or a random information source external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the system. 2. A progressive winnowing of the information for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility or usefulness. 3. Amplification and combination of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survivors to compete at a higher level. (I use 'natural selection' rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 'Darwinian process' because Darwin's view excluded, unnecessarily I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think, feedback from phenotype to genotype as the Lamarckian view allowed.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, this is just Dawkins's meme theory, taken to further
<BR>
conclusions than he probably would have endorsed.  I believe Dennett has a
<BR>
very similar theory.
<BR>
<P>Here's a fact of the matter: in writing this two-kilobyte e-mail, I did
<BR>
not start with two kilobytes of more or less random drivel in my mind,
<BR>
alter it character by character, at random, until I happened upon an
<BR>
e-mail that satisfied me, and then type it out.  The process was far more,
<BR>
dare I say it, *logical* than that.  (When Steven Pinker came and gave a
<BR>
talk at Yale, I asked him why his book, _How the Mind Works_, didn't refer
<BR>
to memes at all, and that was more or less the response that he gave;
<BR>
though he gave the example of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, which also doesn't
<BR>
appear to have been spelled out via natural selection.)
<BR>
<P>You'll notice, as well, that most processes in the human body don't work
<BR>
as you describe.  The human body has organs and organ systems which
<BR>
perform specific functions, not by acting at random and then selecting the
<BR>
organ behavior that works, but by performing more or less the same
<BR>
function from birth.
<BR>
<P>Steven Pinker puts a lot of weight on the &quot;mental machinery&quot; idea, and I
<BR>
think there's a lot of truth to it.  However, isn't there *some* sense in
<BR>
which a natural selection of random data takes place in the brain?  Sure,
<BR>
we don't SPELL that way, since we have developed brain machines to take
<BR>
care of that purely mechanical task for us, but perhaps we wouldn't call
<BR>
it &quot;creative&quot; unless there was SOME element of the Lamarckian in it?
<BR>
Notice as well that my spelling, in this e-mail at least, isn't all that
<BR>
&quot;creative&quot; anyway.
<BR>
<P>While this is the area where meme theory is at its strongest, I think we
<BR>
find that even here we don't have very much evidence that would support
<BR>
the theory.  Why?  Because natural selection/winnowing needs a large
<BR>
sample base before it becomes a plausible mechanism.  Darwinian theory
<BR>
works because evolution takes place over a Really Long Time, thus allowing
<BR>
many different random possbilities to select from.  It's hard to guess how
<BR>
many different concepts I had in mind for this e-mail, but I find it
<BR>
highly unlikely that I had more than, say, two or three for this e-mail,
<BR>
and of those two or three, I can't see any structural relationship
<BR>
whatsoever which would lend me to think that any of them are mutations of
<BR>
one another or a single idea.  (I expect that the same could be said of
<BR>
_Hamlet_, though now we have no way to tell.)
<BR>
<P>You might now object that the reason it seems to be this way to me is
<BR>
because most of the natural selection work has been done subconsciously;
<BR>
the two or three ideas which have emerged from this may not look related,
<BR>
but deep down inside, they really are.  If this is the only area where we
<BR>
can safely assume that natural selection occurs, then this theory is
<BR>
scientifically unverifiable, since *nobody* has access to my unconscious.
<BR>
<P>The only way you COULD verify a theory like this would be by attempting to
<BR>
give some account of the brain chemistry/neuron firing patterns/what have
<BR>
you under which some particular observable phenomenon could
<BR>
uncontroversially be taken to represent a particular idea, and then
<BR>
demonstrating that there are many such ideas, bearing subtle and purely
<BR>
structural differences between them.  I sincerely doubt that you'll find a
<BR>
theory which meets these criterion, though, of course, you're more than
<BR>
welcome to try.  I'm sure you'll be published for it if you succeed.  ;)
<BR>
<P>(With that being said, I want to qualify my claims by saying that I DO
<BR>
think meme theory is good explanation for SOME things, in that it does
<BR>
explain a lot about how certain ideas move about culturally.  The
<BR>
criticism I bring to bear is that human thought can be accounted for
<BR>
*purely* in terms of meme theory, or even just human creativity.  To be
<BR>
more precise, I think that focusing on memes is a good way to think about
<BR>
culture, but the wrong way to think about individual human intelligence.)
