<EM>&gt;From: &quot;john grigg&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20ECON:%20Eleizer's%20call's&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000306190432.73870.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">starman125@hotmail.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Eliezer, I would say that there are people out there who get up in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;morning and with their morning coffee think, &quot;I will do whatever it takes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;preserve my interests and the present power structure!&quot;.  Even if they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not see themselves as against prosperity and personal freedom for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;masses, they actually may be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course, your point is well taken that the &quot;powers that be&quot; will most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely be opposed to a nanotech transformation of society in the narrow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;focus in which their individual authority and interest lies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would like to think there will not be an X-files like, &quot;shadow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conspiracy&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to pull the strings from behind the scenes!  Again, I could see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;near-anything boxes&quot; being owned and used only by licensed government and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporate powers in the name of protection from accidents and terrorism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This would be done in the name of the current trend in law enforcement that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;infringes on personal liberties for &quot;the common good.&quot;  This would make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that much harder to have the raw freedom to pursue one's interests by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one's own box.  By not having them directly in the public's hands, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government and corporate sector are much better able to regulate things and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maintain to at least a certain extent the status quo.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think &quot;they&quot; will be able to keep the masses from this technology 
<BR>
very long.  The hacker ethic &quot;power to the people&quot; and &quot;information wants to 
<BR>
be free&quot; and the like, I am sure, will see to it that the technology is 
<BR>
obtained by the underground.  The best way to deal with the problem, I 
<BR>
think, is to freely release verifyable forms of the tech so that, say, if I 
<BR>
tried to manufacture anthrax my nano-device would immediately report me to 
<BR>
the authorities.  But as long as I limit my creations to food, diamonds, 
<BR>
computer parts, etc. I'll have no problem with the feds.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, I'll try to get an unregistered version from the Cult of the Dead 
<BR>
Cow and then...look out!
<BR>
