FBI critics claim that FLIR video taken over Waco reveals 
<BR>
automatic gunfire into the community on the last day. The
<BR>
FBI counters with the claim that the flashes are not gun 
<BR>
shots and that FLIR can't even detect gunfire. However, 
<BR>
an inside source informs Matt Drudge that during FLIR 
<BR>
tests conducted in Waco today: &quot;The hot flashes were 
<BR>
completely recreated using a sniper on the ground.&quot; 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>SOURCES: WACO RE-ENACTMENT SHOWS 'OBVIOUS GUNFIRE'; 
<BR>
FLASHES CAPTURED ON TAPE 
<BR>
<P>**Exclusive** 
<BR>
<P>Rapid-fire bursts of light appearing on aerial infrared 
<BR>
surveillance footage made by the FBI during the 1993 showdown 
<BR>
at Waco were spectacularly recreated on Sunday, according to 
<BR>
investigators, rapid-fire bursts recreated by flashes from gunfire!
<BR>
<P>&quot;The hot flashes were completely recreated using a sniper on 
<BR>
the ground,&quot; revealed a congressional source, one of 35 people 
<BR>
to witness the court-ordered re-enactment of the final hours 
<BR>
of the Branch Davidian showdown.
<BR>
<P>A second source also present at the tightly-controlled test 
<BR>
conducted at Fort Hood said the FBI, which claimed the '93 
<BR>
flashes were simply reflections of sunlight off debris and 
<BR>
water, has been dealt a setback on Sunday.
