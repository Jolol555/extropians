<P><EM> &gt; Freenet is a pull-only medium.  There's no way to &quot;send&quot; anyone anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; One can only publish, and hope someone requests, information.  Further,
</EM><BR>
<P>There are still ways to attack the content. One could flood the
<BR>
namespace with bogus submissions, thus making bona fide documents hard
<BR>
to find. By publishing a lot of big random blobs, and creating a fake
<BR>
demand for them (M$ has a lot of machines, and there are things like
<BR>
Troj_trinoo and Stacheldraht), which would be DoS against the
<BR>
participants' donated resources.
<BR>
<P>A number of possible attacks are described in a number of papers.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the actual storage of the information is determined by its pattern of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; requests--information that is not requested gets &quot;garbage collected&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like the adaptive replication/information flow over the virtual
<BR>
network part.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Finally, since it is designed from the ground up to to prevent censorship,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; if there's a piece of information you like with an advertisement on it,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; anyone is free to post it without the ad as well, and no one will be able
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to tell who posted it, who's reading it, or even where it is stored.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a good dream. Since even highly zombie-designed systems like
<BR>
Napster are immensely successful, Freedom has a good chance.
