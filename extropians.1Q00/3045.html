<P>I don't even know where to start in taking this thing (or at least
<BR>
what's been reported about it) apart. I wonder whether AP butchered
<BR>
it, or whether the actual study is as idio^H^H^H^Hflawed as they
<BR>
make it out to be.
<BR>
<P>The first problem that jumps right out is that they apparently
<BR>
didn't observe people's actual behavior but conducted a poll. That's
<BR>
the easy way out, but the validity of the results is highly
<BR>
questionable. Your return sample *will* be skewed. Some people will
<BR>
bullshit you intentionally. A whole lot will report wrong answers
<BR>
simply because they are insufficiently selfaware.
<BR>
<P>A lot depends on the actual questions asked. Surveys on/about the
<BR>
Internet, by students at sociology departments who try to scrounge
<BR>
together material for a thesis, keep popping up. I've seen a few
<BR>
questionaires drifting by--typically they were posted to inappropriate
<BR>
groups on Usenet, already implying the originator's lack of
<BR>
comprehension of the medium they purport to examine--and there were
<BR>
far too many questions where I would have had to respond with &quot;not
<BR>
applicable&quot;, &quot;that question doesn't make any sense&quot;, &quot;do you want
<BR>
me to answer what you asked or rather what you actually want to
<BR>
know?&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;More time spent online apparently leads to less time spent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  real life, according to a new study.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hate to break it to them, but the online world *is* part of the
<BR>
real world. And already and still increasingly so in ways that even
<BR>
net-unaware people should be able to understand.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; people who spend more than five hours per week online spend less
</EM><BR>
<P>Objection! Define &quot;spending time online&quot;.
<BR>
<P>A substantial part of many people's work time, from university work
<BR>
to office jobs, is spent working with computers permanently connected
<BR>
to the Internet, no matter whether they actually use any non-local
<BR>
network services.
<BR>
<P>Using network services doesn't necessarily correlate to any kind
<BR>
of connection time. I can spend hours reading and writing E-mail
<BR>
and Usenet articles without any communications to the outside world
<BR>
happing during this time. On the other hand, my computers do quite
<BR>
a bit of network communication without any interaction of mine.
<BR>
<P>I won't even start about the technical aspects of connectionsless
<BR>
networks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is one of first to look at the Internet's impact on society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sufficiently vague to not make it a lie, although it is clearly
<BR>
intended to convey an untruthful impression.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;            ``The more hours people use the Internet, the less time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;            they spend with real human beings,'' said Norman Nie...
</EM><BR>
<P>As others have already remarked... er, what others... you don't
<BR>
exist! Go away! Help! The net is full of entities pretending to be
<BR>
human beings!
<BR>
<P>No, this is just too silly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I will spare you the rest.
</EM><BR>
<P>This one's a goodie:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants were given Internet appliances and free Internet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access so they could answer the survey questions electronically.
<BR>
<P>Interesting methodology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It did get me to thinking however, what if... somehow our new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heaven-sent toy were to disappear, and we were to go back to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way we were, before the internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, other than some of the young ones here, I wasn't always on
<BR>
the net. I do remember. I read more bad books back then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if we had to rely mostly upon our neighbors for social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contact?  I have never felt so alone as when I am at a block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; party with my neighbors.  We have so very little to talk about,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so little in common.
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't have block parties.
<BR>
<P>(Don't get me started on neighbors. There are two kinds. Those who
<BR>
you ignore and who ignore you. Those are the good ones. And there
<BR>
are those you keep meeting in court. Those are the bad ones.)
<BR>
<P>I can already see the sociologists slobbering over the ways the
<BR>
net impoverished my social life. Unfortunately, it didn't. My
<BR>
off-net social life may be poor, but irrespective of such qualitative
<BR>
judgment, I can assure you that it's been the way it is for as long
<BR>
as I remember, i.e. at least since pre-school. That covers about
<BR>
15 years of pre-net time. And it seems to run in the family.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Worse still, by the above reasoning, I am spending less time with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;real human beings&quot;, therefore all of you must be... fake human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings. Or imaginary human beings. I assume that means ordinary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans times sqare root of negative one.
</EM><BR>
<P>Damn, I was just about to say that. :-)
<BR>
Maybe I should henceforth go by the name of j*naddy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, our internet addiction is leading to social isolation and... god forbid:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less TELEVISION!  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>The fun thing is, you can keep pouring these advertising millions
<BR>
shifted in response from TV into the Internet and they just keep
<BR>
disappearing. Maybe it's time for a legal initiative to introduce
<BR>
obligatory Internet billboards.
<BR>
