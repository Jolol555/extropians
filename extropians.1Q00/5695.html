While I agree short lived species are &quot;behind&quot; us in terms of
<BR>
evolving *solutions* to aging, aging itself is a fairly universal
<BR>
process (grey hair, reduced libido, organ failure, etc.) and so
<BR>
treatments or methods that work in short lived species would seem
<BR>
to be the first place to start in developing treatments for long
<BR>
lived species such as humans.
<BR>
<P>Relatively sudden death syndromes, such as you point out in male
<BR>
marsupial mice, or the more common example of salmon, are probably
<BR>
stress induced death, perhaps with some of the characteristics of
<BR>
aging.  They would be less likely to be good models in which to test
<BR>
aging interventions.
<BR>
<P>I'd be in line for experimental procedures that have been demonstrated
<BR>
to extend the lifespan of mice to 5+ years.  Even CR can't manage that
<BR>
accomplishment.

<EM>&gt; (although some metabolic pathways or genes might be common but following

<EM>&gt; species that are behind us in the race for immortality.
