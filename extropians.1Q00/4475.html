<EM>&gt; I would like to have the experience that some swear are totally real visits

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providing a comforting exit to oblivion.   I wish I had such an experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to draw strength from.  A women who had  experienced a near-death experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said, &quot;some conjecture and then some simply know!&quot;  In time, as Max More
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicated in a past post, some of us may wind up dying whether we like it or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not.  Ready for the ultimate next frontier?

<P>John, you can have such an experience without dying. Go see Dr, Micheal Pershing
<BR>
and his &quot;Temporal Lobe Seizure&quot; creating equipment in his lab. With finely tuned
<BR>
magnetics no stronger than common appliances around us everyday, when placed
<BR>
near the temporal lobes of your brain, he can reproduce EVERY SINGLE spiritual
<BR>
experience known to humanity from throughout recorded history. Take into account
<BR>
piezo electic phenomenon when rocks are deformed or when we come near strong
<BR>
magnetic fields associated with geological formations and this, for me, explains
<BR>
spiritual phenonena. Especially ghost stories from rock castles. This rationally
<BR>
explains spiritual phenomena like the old hag, the feeling someone's in the room
<BR>
with you, visions of angels or devils or aliens, experiences akin to near
<BR>
NDE...and on and on and on. People that are extremely susceptible to these
<BR>
experiences are creative people and people considered artistic. It's all just in
<BR>
our heads!
