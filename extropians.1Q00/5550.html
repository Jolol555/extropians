<HR NOSHADE><P>

<P>
Do you ever get the feeling that just plain ol' luck is behind much of what
<BR>
happens in life?  Are the Bill Joys, Alfred Noyces, Bill Gateses, etc,
<BR>
really supreme geniuses, or did they just win some kind of global lottery.
<BR>
No question, that when opportunity knocks, you have to get up and answer
<BR>
the door.  But you also have to live in the right neighborhood, and be at
<BR>
home at the time.  You could add to that, your parents answering their
<BR>
respective doors before you, and their parents before them.  An amazing
<BR>
string of sevens at the cosmic crap table leads to the founding of a Sun
<BR>
Microsystems, an Intel, or a Microsoft.
<BR>
<P>I have no doubt that Bill Joy is a very talented software architect.  But
<BR>
it would surprise me a whole heck of a lot if most of the folks on this
<BR>
list couldn't have done all that Bill Joy did, had they been in his shoes
<BR>
when opportunity--the silicon revolution--came knocking.  Read the bio part
<BR>
of his wired article.  Between the lines I got the impression that when he
<BR>
was at Berkeley, buried beneath his work, the OTHER Sun Microsystems
<BR>
founders came and found him.  Dragged him off.  Now he thinks he's hot shit.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Mommy, mommy, the future scares me!&quot;  
<BR>
<P>Go back to Aspen, Bill.  Write some more code.  The future doesn't need YOU.
<BR>
<P>I listened to the NPR program.  I have a coupla of comments.
<BR>
<P>Bill says we should pause, and think about the wisdom of proceeding with
<BR>
these scary technologies.
<BR>
<P>The future is coming, Bill.  Like a juggernaut.  There'll be no slowing it
<BR>
down.  A billion people in India (substantial numbers of programmers riding
<BR>
the wave of the silicon revolution) and more than a billion people in China
<BR>
want a decent standard of living and they're counting on future
<BR>
technologies to deliver it for them.  To slow down the future, you would
<BR>
have to nuke them.  Are you going to nuke them, Bill?  I didn't think so.
<BR>
Then listen to them laugh at you, Bill, as you sit on your deck, and sip
<BR>
your latte, in your palatial mansion in trendy Aspen, Colorado.  And listen
<BR>
to the future roaring in on you, on us all, unstoppable.
<BR>
<P>Bill says the scary terrorist may get us all.
<BR>
<P>Done a lot of sitting in your luxuriously appointed office, with the
<BR>
breathtaking view of the Colorado Rockies, listening to your yes men with
<BR>
their bobbing heads, saying, &quot;Yes, Bill.  Yes, Bill.&quot; ?  Or perhaps, you've
<BR>
just spent too many years--your whole life?--staying up late writing code?
<BR>
Not a lot of experience with,...what do they call it?,...ah, yes, REALITY.
<BR>
<P>Try this, Bill.  The terrorist thing,...it's mostly a fabrication.  You
<BR>
see, people like scary stories.  So the media puts out a whole lot of them.
<BR>
&nbsp;Makes them lots of money.  The name Steven King mean anything to you?
<BR>
Then there's the politicians.  They love the boogeyman.  The Kraut, the
<BR>
Jap, the Commie, the fag, the jew, the arab, the narco-trafficker, the
<BR>
terrorist.  The politician says, &quot;The comm,...er,..terrorists are coming.
<BR>
Vote for me.  I'll save you.&quot;  Then, of course lately, what with peace
<BR>
having broken out since the demise of the evil empire, the entire national
<BR>
security beauracracy has been frantic to hustle up a new boogeyman.  Got
<BR>
mortgages to pay, kids to feed.  International terrorism, that's the
<BR>
ticket.  But perhaps all the terrorist hype has overwhelmed you, and you
<BR>
can't see past it.  Try this instead.
<BR>
<P>The nanobots and biobots that frighten you so?, well you know, they have
<BR>
huge military potential.  So before your demented evil genius terrorist
<BR>
fiend, goes down to his corner &quot;Bot-R-Us&quot; store, with global mayhem--even
<BR>
unto the extinction of the human race, including Bill and his kids--in
<BR>
mind,...  Before that happens, governments will have spent hundreds of
<BR>
billions of dollars and millions of man hours conjuring up every kind of
<BR>
offensive use, defensive counter-measure, plan, strategy, scenario, weapons
<BR>
system, policy issue, cost-benefit analysis, yadda yadda yadda--enough to
<BR>
make every taxpayer get down on his knees and pray for human extinction.
<BR>
What chance really, does your lone terrorist have against all those
<BR>
resources marshalled against his tender little psychosis?  Really Bill, you
<BR>
need to get out more.
<BR>
<P>So, bottom line, this Wired article thing?  A major publishing coup for
<BR>
Wired News.  That's their business, and they done real good.  A super scary
<BR>
story about really scary high technology, even now emerging--as heralded,
<BR>
ta, taaa!, by Wired News-- from the semi-irrelevance of science fiction to
<BR>
the mind-shattering preeminence of science non-fiction, and brought to you
<BR>
by the much envied because he's very rich and very prestigious because he's
<BR>
very rich, wunderkind of the silicon digerati, trendy Aspen Branch,  no
<BR>
joy, Killjoy, Bill Joy.  Yippeee! 
<BR>
<P>Enjoy this momentary return to the spotlight, Bill, cause it looks like
<BR>
puffery to me, and not likely to last. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
