<P>
Why not code in some contingent answers, more or less of the form:  &quot;Maybe
<BR>
X is right,&quot; where X is one of our moral intuitions, but leave the total
<BR>
probability that our moral intuitions are right far short of 100%.
<BR>
<P>These obviously aren't Asimov laws, since they're designed to be
<BR>
overridden if the computer has some reason to do so.  Thus the fact that
<BR>
they can be &quot;worked around&quot; shouldn't bother us at all; nor do I think
<BR>
these lines would backfire on us unexpectedly any more than any other line
<BR>
of goal-code.  While you might suppose that assigning our current beliefs
<BR>
any probability greater than 0 is hubris, I'd say that giving them a small
<BR>
positive value isn't lying; it's giving the AI the best information we
<BR>
have available to us and saying &quot;OK, now run with this.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A similar approach might involve &quot;messages&quot; which we have loaded into the
<BR>
AI to help it accelerate its development; you discuss the possibility
<BR>
favorably in &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI.&quot;  The idea here being that once the
<BR>
AI is smart enough to understand our moral intuitions, we just tell it
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;We think that you ought to get informed consent before you harm
<BR>
something/someone&quot; and let the AI sort out whether we're right or not.
<BR>
Assuming that it assigns some non-zero value to the probability that we're
<BR>
right, we'll have a similar result, only, of course, in this case, it will
<BR>
be the AI determining the probability that we're right, not us as in the
<BR>
former case.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, there's some reason to believe that there's just no way that the
<BR>
computer will derive informed consent without a lot of knowledge and/or
<BR>
experience about the world around it, experience which we've had coded
<BR>
into our genes over the course of millions of years, and which we would be
<BR>
sitting ducks without.  We're either going to have to wait millions of
<BR>
years for the computer to figure out what we've had coded in already, (and
<BR>
this time cannot be accelerated by faster computing power; these are facts
<BR>
gotten from experience, not from deduction) or else we're going to have to
<BR>
tell it about a few of our moral intuitions, and then let the AI decide
<BR>
what to make of them.
<BR>
<P>Unless of course you're going to give it a whole psychology module replete
<BR>
with scores of rejectable facts about human nature.  Actually, you're
<BR>
probably going to have to do that anyway, if you want the thing to speak
<BR>
English within our lifetimes.
<BR>
<P>I'm not advocating a Cyc model, but if you think Elisson is ACTUALLY going
<BR>
to start with &quot;I need a goal object&quot; and deduce the existence of taxes and
<BR>
tapioca pudding from that, you're fooling yourself.
