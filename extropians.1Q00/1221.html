<EM>&gt; &gt; Ecological disruption is, to a large extent, caused by government

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh???  I would say the fundamental cause for ecological disruption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a failure to account in an economic sense (meaning in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accounting and tax laws) for &quot;theft&quot; from the global commons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The solution to this is not &quot;less&quot; government regulation, but &quot;more&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would disagree completely.  The problem is that these things are viewed as
<BR>
global commons, which results in the Tragedy of the Commons.  The solution
<BR>
to this tragedy is to redefine the commons so that individuals own pieces of
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Of course, in the particular examples I cited -- the American Southwest,
<BR>
e.g. -- the problem was not so much that various people were polluting a
<BR>
commons.  Instead, the government came in with electrification and
<BR>
irrigation projects which then changed a basically unprofitable area to
<BR>
farm, do business, and live in into one which a lot of people now have
<BR>
incentives to farm, work, and live in.  The free market didn't build those
<BR>
dams.  To this day, most of these projects are kept viable by massive
<BR>
influxes of government [i.e., tax, i.e., stolen] money.  Sans government,
<BR>
the Southwest would most likely still be its wild state.
<BR>
<P>This also goes for lumber concerns in the Pacific Northwest.  The government
<BR>
builds the roads, else it would be unprofitable to take lumber from that
<BR>
area.  Also, the government gives very cheap prices on leases for the land.
<BR>
All of this sets of an infrastructure for environmental destruction -- all
<BR>
while subsidizing, in typical welfare state fashion, one group of people
<BR>
(lumber interests) at the expense of everyone else (especially taxpayers).
<BR>
This is hardly the free market in action.  Sans government, this would,
<BR>
again, most likely not happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, perhaps you are saying this, but it seems indirect.
</EM><BR>
<P>I most certainly am NOT saying what Robert says or believes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government could be *totally* uninvolved and developers might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still develop land in ways that polluted streams and damaged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; salmon habitats.  Until the developers have to &quot;account&quot; for that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damage in some way (ultimately passing the costs onto the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; land/housing purchasers), you will have environmental degradation.
</EM><BR>
<P>The wya ot do this is to assign and strictly enforce property rights.  If
<BR>
someone pollutes my well and I can sue, then few people will pollute my
<BR>
well, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The same applies to the pollution produced by your automobile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sewer wastes, farm fertilizer runoff, electrical power plant, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are in any way &quot;changing&quot; the environment and you do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have an accounting line item to deal with those &quot;free inputs&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and associated &quot;costs&quot;, then you are a bandit.  This isn't a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government problem it is an accounting problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problems Robert mentions are, again, tainted by government involvement.
<BR>
Since road building and ownership and sewage treatment are government
<BR>
concerns, and since the government subsidizes farming in myriad ways and
<BR>
regulates, susidizes, and, in some cases, own electrification, all of these
<BR>
are areas of government involvement.  Finally, governments have basically
<BR>
encouraged pollution and habitat desctruction through laws which forbid,
<BR>
e.g., class action suits against polluters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, this is in no way to say that governments don't contribute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the problem.  The decline in fisheries around the globe is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; due in large part to the &quot;hands off&quot; approach to regulation as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well as a promotion of the industry through subsidies aimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at producing more and increasingly efficient sea-produce harvesters.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then why not get rid of those subsidies?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Face it, the free market on its own would not invest in the Amazon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the American Southwest, or Nigeria.  Those places are either unsafe,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't provide skilled labor, don't have the infrastructure (roads,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; housing, etc.), or lacking in resources.  Also, what resources there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are already owned -- in the Lockean sense of the world, even if the
</EM><BR>
local
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; governments don't recognize such ownership -- by the locals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh?  I'm not sure where this came from, but it depends entirely on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what type of &quot;investment&quot; you are discussing.  We are lossing millions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of acres of rain-forest annually because the &quot;land&quot; and clearing costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are cheap enough and the returns on cattle production profitable enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to justify that activity in the Amazon.  What is missing is an accounting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the environmental degradation that results from those activities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert is wrong about cattle production in the Amazon being profitable.
<BR>
It's profitable only in the sense that the Brazilian government subsidizes
<BR>
cattle ranching.  Without those subsidies and other subsidies for
<BR>
deforestation there, cattle ranching would not be profitable there.  (Also,
<BR>
since I don't eat animals, I'm not helping this process along.:)  Again, we
<BR>
don't have the free market here munching up the Amazon, but cattle ranchers
<BR>
who have friends in the Brazilian government basically using their clout to
<BR>
get a free ride of the backs of the Brazilian taxpayer (and the American
<BR>
taxpayer too, since the IMF has outstanding loans on Brazil).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, with regard to NY, I would agree that you have a messed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system derived from some collusion between the politicians and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building industry.  Removing rent control would simply result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in creating a highly exclusive enclave in Manhatten.  Whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is good or bad is IMO a social issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not so.  What would happen is rents would rise in some areas of NYC,
<BR>
but this would increase the production of new housing there at all levels of
<BR>
price.  The long run effect would be that new housing would eventually
<BR>
compete and drive the price down.  Right now, new housing does get created
<BR>
in NYC, though almost exclusively at very high price levels given the
<BR>
unprofitability of creating lower income housing.
<BR>
<P>The regulations on buildings and on new construction, including rules on
<BR>
what companies can build and zoning laws, all collude to price all but the
<BR>
most expensive housing out of the market in NYC.  This, again, is not the
<BR>
free market in action, but various groups and people using government to
<BR>
keep the free market from functioning properly.
<BR>
<P>Finally, rent control does not specifically benefit the low income.  A lot
<BR>
of people living in rent controlled apartments who I know are doing quite
<BR>
well -- making $60K or more per year.  They can afford higher prices, but
<BR>
argue stenuously to keep rent control.  Why do you think they do this?
<BR>
Because they really want to help out their fellow New Yorkers?  Or is it
<BR>
more likely because they want to spend more of their disposable income on
<BR>
having a good time?
<BR>
<P>Liberta!
