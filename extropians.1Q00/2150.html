<EM>&gt;Here are the questions to ask:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The answer to the first question seems to be: suprisingly low.
</EM><BR>
<P>Goodness, no.  Vaccination remains the only effective treatment
<BR>
for smallpox, even today.  Given that smallpox is transmitted
<BR>
through the air human-to-human, and that it's mortality is ~30%
<BR>
in populations adapted to it, and that virtually everybody used
<BR>
to get it, about 2 billion owe their lives to that one.
<BR>
<P>Some others I can think of are whooping cough, polio (already
<BR>
mentioned by others), and hepatitis B.  The rate things are
<BR>
going on the antibiotic resistance front, we may have to 
<BR>
revive the staph aureus vaccine soon.
<BR>
<P>I'm glad I got the measles
<BR>
vaccine and I really wish the chickenpox vaccine had been 
<BR>
available when I was younger.  I could pass on the scars and
<BR>
I'm *not* looking forward to shingles.  I know my life wasn't
<BR>
greatly endangered by either (some for measles, I know) but
<BR>
still...
