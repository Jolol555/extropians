Sorry, for this rather late reply to an old thread, but Im not 
<BR>
reading all the extropy list postings every day anymore... 
<BR>
(too little time, too much to do... :-&lt; )
<BR>
<P>In a posting from March 10th, Zero Powers wrote:

<P><EM>&gt; When talking nano, the best defense is an infallible, impenetrable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-hackable offense.  For your plan to work, your offense would have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be practically perfect and everyone else's offense would have to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperfect.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you DONT need a *PERFECT* defense. 
<BR>
<P>Lets assume an active shield defense made out of a large amount of 
<BR>
separate bots. Then what you need, to overcome any enemy attack, is :
<BR>
<P>More resources at standby than the attacker, and a way to detect if 
<BR>
your own defense bots are not secretly modified by the attacker.
<BR>
<P><P>Your defense bots may be less efficient in destroying and detecting 
<BR>
enemy bots, as long is this is compensated by a larger amount of 
<BR>
defense/attack resources.
<BR>
<P>For example if you have a hundred times as many defensebots (and the 
<BR>
bots are of the same order of size as the attacker) then all your 
<BR>
defense bots need to do is seek out and destroy the enemy bots.
<BR>
Because you have a hundred times the amount of bots, you dont need a 
<BR>
perfect way to destroy the enemy bots. Your defense bots only have to 
<BR>
be more than 1% effective in destroying the enemy bots than vice versa! 
<BR>
<P>I think its quite unlikely that (assuming you try staying informed 
<BR>
about the latest technology) your enemy can get ahead in technology 
<BR>
by such a large amount that its bots are a hundred times more 
<BR>
effective at attacking. (It could even be fundamentally impossible 
<BR>
to make a hundred times more effective attacking bots.)
<BR>
<P>Of course, you will have to keep an eye on your potential enemies, 
<BR>
to check if they are not trying to create more resources than you 
<BR>
can overcome with your own defense resources available.
<BR>
<P>The most difficult detail could be in the mechanisms used for 
<BR>
detection of modification to your own defense bots. Maybe some 
<BR>
kind of public key certificate system could be used, where the 
<BR>
secret key is destroyed by the bot when its integrity is expected 
<BR>
to be violated. (When all public key systems are rendered useless, 
<BR>
because of for example quantum computers, a secret key system 
<BR>
with some heavily guarded central lookup systems could be used 
<BR>
in stead. However this last option is more vulnerable and less 
<BR>
efficient.) These will be used together with external 
<BR>
recognition mechanisms. 
<BR>
<P>However all these detection mechanisms dont need to have 
<BR>
perfect 100% efficiency. In case of a 100 times more resources 
<BR>
it would already be sufficient to have more than 1% efficiency!  
<BR>
(When assuming the same destruction efficiency as the enemy.)
<BR>
<P>Im fairly confident that detection mechanisms with a certain 
<BR>
limited efficiency are possible.
<BR>
<P>So ultimately it all comes down to who has the most resources 
<BR>
(e.g. the most defense/attack bots at hand). And the one who 
<BR>
starts first creating these resources will thus have the edge.
<BR>
<P><P>(However this is assuming that no fundamentally new physics 
<BR>
will be discovered by your enemy that you are not aware of.)
