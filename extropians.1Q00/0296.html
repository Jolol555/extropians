</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intercourse, oral..er..verbal, with his ass, his OWN ass no less.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was quite a trick, but not as great as that of Moses, who
<BR>
tied his ass to a tree, then walked on ten furlongs.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Elijah or  ..sha, I can't remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which, righteously caused a bear to attack and kill a bunch of children...
</EM><BR>
<P>That was Elisha.  II Kings 2:23.  But he got laid anyway.  Verse 25 says:
<BR>
&quot;And he went from thence to mount Carmel...&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...Elisha or ...ja, I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember which, was fed by ravens during a famine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Elijah.  I Kings 17:6.  He also got laid a couple verses later:  V. 9: [God
<BR>
said to him] &quot;Arise get thee to Zarephath...behold, I have commanded
<BR>
a widow woman there to sustain thee...&quot;
<BR>
<P>But Elijah couldn't get enough.  In verse 19:  &quot;He said unto her [the widow],
<BR>
Give me thy son.  And he took him out of her bosom and carried him
<BR>
up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I should get off my lazy ass and look up the Biblical references for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above, but I don't find any pleasure or benefit or redeeming quality in time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent in a place that consumed too much of me, already...
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too, Rick, me too.  {8-|  spike
