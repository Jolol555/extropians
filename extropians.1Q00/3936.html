<P><EM>&gt; The average wage in the U.S. was twenty-two cents an hour.  The average 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; U.S. worker made between $200 and $400 per year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A competent accountant could expect to earn $2000 per year, a dentist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $2500 per year, a veterinarian between $1500 and $4000 per year, and a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanical engineer about $5000 per year.
</EM><BR>
<P>So if return to skill was as great as at the turn of the century,
<BR>
engineers would be making $500K per year in 2000 dollars?
<BR>
<P>(actually, there is a more reasonable interpretation: the salaried and
<BR>
quasi-professionals have held constant with the 22-fold rise in prices,
<BR>
but wage earners have managed to gain an additional tripling over that, 
<BR>
actually bettering their lot.  It is too bad we were not given 
<BR>
figures for rentiers) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eighteen percent of households in the United States had at least one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full-time servant or domestic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Orwell's _Road to Wigan Pier_ is now on my to-read list, as it seems 
<BR>
germane to two recent FoRKposts.  Apparently the first part consists 
<BR>
of a bit of anthropology of depression-era working-class England, 
<BR>
and the second part is an essay in which Orwell argues that the 
<BR>
middle classes had best overcome any snobbish separation from the 
<BR>
working classes, lest they be eventually subsumed anyway.
<BR>
<P>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.iit.edu/~beberg/out-there.html">http://www.iit.edu/~beberg/out-there.html</A>&gt; seems a good 
<BR>
parallel to Orwell's exploration of middle class views of the 
<BR>
working classes.  (Adam, best to be a bit wary of the Meadian
<BR>
Samoan in your fieldwork :-)
<BR>
<P>&lt;<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/Slouch_causes3.html">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/Slouch_causes3.html</A>&gt; has an 
<BR>
interesting quote from RtWP which indicates that Orwell's definition 
<BR>
of the middle class was &quot;at least one (really, preferably more than 
<BR>
two) full-time servant(s) or domestic(s)&quot;.  By this definition, we 
<BR>
can put an upper bound of 18% on the number of middle class US 
<BR>
households in 1900.  What about in 2000?  Checking the figures from 
<BR>
the Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1997-1998, we find that 
<BR>
&quot;high-income households&quot; (those with incomes of $90+K, &lt;6% of the 
<BR>
population) spend only $1800 on average for &quot;Household Operations&quot;.
<BR>
If we figure that 19 of those households spend nothing on domestic 
<BR>
services, the 20th could afford one full-time helper, so the Orwellian 
<BR>
middle class has shrunk in the US to (well) under .3% from 18%.
<BR>
<P>Now, I gather when people worry about a &quot;disappearing middle class&quot;, 
<BR>
they are not referring to that particular segment of the population. 
<BR>
Is there a generally accepted definition of &quot;middle class&quot;?  If we 
<BR>
believe the US to truly be a middle class country, then perhaps taking 
<BR>
the arbitrary middle 60% would do it: households with yearly incomes 
<BR>
between $12K and $64K.  (note that this definition also fits with 
<BR>
the current fashion in economic thought that dictates that how much 
<BR>
currency one spends is much more indicative of utility than how one 
<BR>
chooses to spend one's time)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The five leading causes of death in the U.S. were:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    1. Pneumonia and influenza
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    2. Tuberculosis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    3. Diarrhea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    4. Heart disease
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    5. Stroke
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From &lt;<A HREF="http://www.youfirst.com/TOPTEN.HTM">http://www.youfirst.com/TOPTEN.HTM</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
1. Diseases of the Heart
<BR>
2. Malignant cancers ...
<BR>
3. Cerebrovascular diseases [Stroke? -dl]
<BR>
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diseases and allied lung conditions
<BR>
5. Accidental injury ...
<BR>
6. Pneumonia and influenza
<BR>
<P>It is reassuring to see that 100 years later, we now have the 
<BR>
dignity of dying of stress, carcinogens, smoking, or while
<BR>
drunkenly driving instead of expiring via TB or diarrhea. :-)
<BR>
<P>(and the reasonable interpretation: we've actually done a decent job 
<BR>
of keeping death away from the young.  Hurrah!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most women only washed their hair once a month and used borax or egg 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yolks for shampoo.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still haven't done the Sodium Lauryl Sulfate vs. storebought 
<BR>
shampoo test; I suppose now I need to check out borax (which makes a 
<BR>
bitchin' hand cleaner after dealing with greasy Camaros) and egg 
<BR>
yolks (well known for promoting shiny glossy coats) as other 
<BR>
products which may very well be too incredibly cheap to be of any 
<BR>
possible benefit to a consumer.  (then again, there's probably a 
<BR>
decent market for egg yolk shampoo at $35 the bottle: organic, 
<BR>
antioxidant, emollient, or otherwise buzzword compliant)
