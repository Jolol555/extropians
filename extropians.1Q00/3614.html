Spike is an ENTP.  He made some amazing new rocket technology in high
<BR>
school and got hired by NASA.  and look, he's into recumbents ! ;-)

<EM>&gt; Spike on bikes:

<EM>&gt; &gt;  I had a thought while riding the other day.  Recumbents have never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  caught on much, but if they had been invented first, I wouldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  imagine the now-traditional knd would have caught on . . . .

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  [R]ecumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The story of bikes v. 'bents reveals something of the problems facing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological innovations.  Here's a brief version told from the 'bent point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of view, lifted from the FAQ of the International Human Powered Vehicle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Association &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ihpva.org/FAQ/#around">http://www.ihpva.org/FAQ/#around</A>&gt;:

<EM>&gt; In 1933 Charles Mochet built a supine recumbent named the &quot;Velocar&quot;. Between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the years of 1933 and 1938 pro racer Francois Faure, while riding the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Velocar, set several speed records for both the mile and kilometer. In Paris
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on July 7, 1933, Francis Faure broke the 20 year-old hour record of 44.247
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; km. by going 45.055 km.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately Faure's hour record created a controversy amongst the Union
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cycliste Internationale (U.C.I.), the governing body for bicycle races. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controversy was based on whether the Velocar was a bicycle and whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time records were legal. In February 1934, the U.C.I. decided against Faure's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; record and banned all recumbents and aerodynamic devices from racing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is the reason why recumbents have not gained popularity in the racing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scene, and why they have not been mass produced by bike manufacturers.

<EM>&gt; Fuller accounts of the tale relate the ugly roles played by nationalism and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industrial protectionism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That said, allow me to note that the diamond frame bike exhibits well-evolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering.  It's a design tested by time and many iterations to satisfy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty stringent criteria.  Not for nothing did the Wright brothers run a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bike shop.
