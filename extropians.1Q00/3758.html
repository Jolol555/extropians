<P>
Thus sprach Eugene Leitl:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;His description of the state of the neural tissue due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ischaemia/freezing is entirely incorrect. I hate to be blunt, but he's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moving entirely outside of his area of expertise.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's very unfortunate that the computer scientist Merkle knows
<BR>
little about neural tissue damage, while cryobiologists like
<BR>
Fahy and Darwin know next to nothing about computational
<BR>
techniques which are available to recover corrupted structures
<BR>
which seem, to one untrained in such techniques, to be
<BR>
utterly unrecoverable.  Thus, alas, there exist *no* expert
<BR>
opinions on the chances of future repair of the damage
<BR>
sustained in cryonics.
<BR>
<P>&quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(assuming a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nondissipative, deterministic physical process despite dramatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evidence to the contrary
</EM><BR>
<P>Freezing is largely nondissipative.  Cracked and displaced
<BR>
surfaces, furthermore, leave around a large amount of information
<BR>
on matching surfaces, like a jigsaw puzzle. Thus for freezing
<BR>
damage Merkle's analysis may be too *pessimistic*: we can often use
<BR>
pattern matching rather than the computationally more expensive
<BR>
cryptanalysis/machine learing techniques.  Ischemic damage
<BR>
is another matter.  It involves quite dissipative chemical
<BR>
reactions.  There is good reason to believe that freezing
<BR>
damaging will be vastly easier to correct than ischemic damage.
<BR>
<P>The good news is that hypothermic conditions, for example
<BR>
hypothermic surgery, have been observed to prevent ischemia
<BR>
for hours at a time.  Unfortuneately good hypothermic
<BR>
conditions are often absent.  Prevention of ischemic damage
<BR>
needs much further study and higher priority in cryonics procedures.
<BR>
<P>Another piece of good news (for cryonics!) is that ischemic damage
<BR>
is a very common event, for example stroke, that the brain
<BR>
has to some extent evolved to protect against, for example
<BR>
through redundant storage of long term memories.  Brain
<BR>
damage from stroke is usually the result of loss of function
<BR>
of parts of the brain the function of which is to retrieve
<BR>
and process long term memories, rather than loss of the long
<BR>
term memories themselves.  So after even a major stroke
<BR>
lasting for days the information is usually still there.
<BR>
<P>These are all testable claims and it would be great to
<BR>
discuss studies on hypothermia, stroke, etc. rather than
<BR>
continue to speculate.  There also needs to be more
<BR>
cross-disciplinary learning between computer scientists and
<BR>
cryobiologists.
