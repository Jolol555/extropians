<EM>&gt; &gt; Extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         The first big clue that Bill Joy is way off in his wired
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; article comes with his comment early on:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; tiny elite - just as it is today&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         I don't know how he came up with this but to me nothing could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be further from the truth.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip, snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would have to disagree. At the current time, corporations and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large &quot;elite&quot; groups can wield far more computing power than you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibly buy. Even if you get all your friends together ala SETI. IBM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is going to have a petaflop computer in just a few years. All cheaper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer chips mean is that the corporations can still buy many more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of them than you. I will admit that the Internet is quite an empowering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;invention for the individual, buts lets face it that big money still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matters.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the fact of the matter is that the average individual presently has no 
<BR>
need whatsoever for control over large systems of machines.  I personally 
<BR>
would have no idea what to do with a supercomputer, besides writing and 
<BR>
reading, like I do on my lowly Pentium class box.  However, say, if some 
<BR>
sort of computational war were to be declared by IBM against the rest of us 
<BR>
(and if the stakes in the outcome were sufficiently important) the ~200 
<BR>
million internet users could combine the computing power of their machines 
<BR>
and absolutely trounce IBM.
<BR>
<P>Right now only the military and the police are allowed to have special 
<BR>
weapons like fully automatic weapons.  But if war were to break out between 
<BR>
the police/national guard against the millions of legally armed folks in the 
<BR>
US with their hunting rifles and pistols, my money would be on the poorly 
<BR>
armed masses.
<BR>
<P>-Zero

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
