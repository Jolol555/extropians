<P><EM>&gt; HUMANITY FIRST!  We are capable of creating a technological/biological/

choose 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the former?

I read the article (at work) monday night in Wired. I suppose the whole 
<BR>
purpose of the article was not to fall into techno-optimism/pomposity such as 
<BR>
what happended with the &quot;nuclear age&quot;.   I bring that up since that example 
<BR>
was used heavilly in the Wired article, which featured Sun's founder; who 
<BR>
cautioned against such stumbles in genetics and nano.  Now we go back to 
<BR>
asking; if we don't promote bio and nano, and Others do we will still suffer 
<BR>
the grey goo blues, without any green goo bennies, because we will have 
<BR>
vacated a leadership position.
