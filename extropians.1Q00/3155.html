<P>
Spike - That is not possible so long as Alpha must remain anonymous
<BR>
to Charlie.
<BR>
<P>In general, if Alpha must remain strictly anonymous to Charlie, then
<BR>
Charlie must stand ready to provide his information to an anonymous
<BR>
person.  But that means that he is ready to provide the information to
<BR>
anyone, since anyone can be anonymous.  Therefore Bravo can also
<BR>
play the role of the anonymous person and learn the information.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you tightened up the condtions so that Charlie was only willing
<BR>
to do this ONCE, and if we assume at the end that Alpha MUST end up with
<BR>
the information (or he will know Bravo cheated), then it is possible.
<BR>
<P>Charlie must broadcast his public key to everyone who might want to
<BR>
communicate with him.  This can be done by a direct person to person
<BR>
contact.  It does not impair Alpha's anonymity because everyone gets
<BR>
the same key.
<BR>
<P>Now Alpha, via Bravo, sends an encrypted message to Charlie with his own
<BR>
(Alpha's) public key.  Bravo can't alter this message because it is
<BR>
encrypted, and he can't learn Alpha's public key for the same reason.
<BR>
<P>Charlie answers back, via Bravo, with the secret information, encrypted
<BR>
to Alpha's public key.  Only Alpha can read this and so the secret
<BR>
information stays secret.
<BR>
<P>I believe it may be possible to eliminate the need for Alpha to know
<BR>
Charlie's public key at the beginning, if the secret information being
<BR>
requested is something that only Charlie could know, and is checkable
<BR>
by Alpha (so that Bravo can't just pretend to be Charlie to Alpha).
<BR>
Of course if Alpha knew this fact about Charlie initially, it is also
<BR>
plausible that he could have known Charlie's public key.  In either
<BR>
case Alpha knows SOMETHING about Charlie.  However this solution is very
<BR>
technical (and I just came up with it) so I won't try to explain it here.
<BR>
