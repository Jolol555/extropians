</EM><BR>
<P>Clearly a problem.  Solved in Elephants and Sharks by having
<BR>
ever-reproducing teeth (actually in elephants the process fails
<BR>
after 10-20 &quot;generations&quot; and it is a major cause of elphant death).
<BR>
<P>Related to this is starvation among the &quot;oldest-old&quot; in western
<BR>
civilizations where they can eat food (dentures work after-all),
<BR>
but are unable to digest it effectively.  IMO, more than likely
<BR>
due to telomere loss slowing the replication of cells in the
<BR>
stomach and small intestine leading to the accumulation of cells
<BR>
that are rather dysfunctional with regard to nutrient absorption.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So we supplied them with three things: a grinding wheel, a reverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; osmosis water filter (which eliminated amoebiasis) and a supply of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kaopectate, which prevented many infant deaths.  In the long run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the effect was to cause the population to increase beyond what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that high desert location could support, and the young people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; began to drift off to Mexico City to lives of who knows what,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but with their limited education of things modern (none), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lack of language skills they probably ended up as prostitutes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or worse.  We were debating discontinuing the effort when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only practical way into their mesa, an airplane, was stolen... spike

<P>Spike, Spike, Spike, you just gotta get a script writer.  This has
<BR>
the same tragico-comedic line of several other films situated in
<BR>
Mexico, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;.  You have to produce
<BR>
a picture of this someday.  I'll offer to play the role of the
<BR>
technocrat who thinks tecnology will solve all the problems, only
<BR>
to discover that solving one set leads to the creation of another
<BR>
leading me to retire to reflect on the circular nature of life
<BR>
on a beach in Costa Rica.
