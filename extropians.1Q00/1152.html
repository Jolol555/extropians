Why the sacred cow?I think artificial wombs *might* make having babies much 
<BR>
less of an ordeal,and a large percentage of women would opt for it, if only 
<BR>
avoid pain, and topreserve their bodys elastins... er um... vanity...plus 
<BR>
making it possible for people to have babies that previously could 
<BR>
not!Almost every sci-fi novel I've read about bio-tech has an artificial 
<BR>
wombscenario.Apart from allowing women to relax a little, it also changes 
<BR>
the nature ofbreeding and sex. Sex itself not being the act of conception, 
<BR>
it loses or gains momentum?
<BR>
(end of reproduction)
<BR>
<P>The artificial womb would be the dream of most career women.  Combine that 
<BR>
with affordable childcare (perhaps made possible by robotic nannies) and you 
<BR>
have women leaping for joy.  My own mother likes to routinely tell my 
<BR>
brother and I about all the suffering she went through to bring us into the 
<BR>
world!  But I think it would go from being seen as miracle machine to a 
<BR>
gizmo for busy yuppie women and then to being just commonplace.
<BR>
<P>I have read that the infant is to an extent learning or imprinting while in 
<BR>
the womb from his or her mother's voice.  Couldn't an artificial womb really 
<BR>
interfere with this process?  I'm not sure if tape recordings could be an 
<BR>
adequate substitute.  Perhaps a future child psychologist will write &quot;this 
<BR>
new breed of child looks at us with frightening and unfeeling eyes that one 
<BR>
day could wreak unknown chaos upon us!&quot;
<BR>
<P>The nature of sex is going to change with such things as artificial wombs, 
<BR>
in vitro genegineering, failproof birth-control, cheap robot nannies and 
<BR>
elimination of STD's.  It may take longer for hedonic engineering to enter 
<BR>
the picture due to social mores.  I would like to see posts addressing how a 
<BR>
combination of these factors will affect human mating and family patterns.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps some of the sacredness attached to the sex act will be lost when the 
<BR>
artificial womb is common.  But in that era for a woman to choose nature's 
<BR>
option may make her seen as truly astonishing and impressive.  Nature may 
<BR>
not be so taken for granted then.
<BR>
