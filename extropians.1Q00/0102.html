<EM> &gt; I have archived all the correspondence from the previous threads; it was

<EM> &gt; precisely my experience with them that motivated the current post. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my personal opinion that discussions of, e.g. Libertarianism, Gun Control
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Legislation and an Extropian Political Platforms have nothing whatever to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; do with either Transhumanism or Extropianism.

<P>Strictly speaking, Robert, you are correct.  TH/Exisms are about the
<BR>
philosophy of evolution and perhaps ways for evaluating and judging
<BR>
different moral values, advantages and disadvantages of courses of action,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;economics&quot; creep in when you actually get into the
<BR>
details of how to implement these moral values and courses of action.
<BR>
<P>In particular, the more extreme discussions of such things as Libertarianism,
<BR>
Gun Control, escape to other planets, enclaves, etc. are a form of &quot;worst
<BR>
case&quot; analysis.  What do we do if our &quot;best efforts&quot; at convincing people
<BR>
that taking self-control of our evoulution fail?  What happens if we misjudge
<BR>
things, go to fast, and slip and fall?  How do we balance, even among
<BR>
ourselves the differences between the go-fasters and the go-slowers?
<BR>
<P>I would hate to see us move from organizations involved in rational
<BR>
educational discussions to organizations with &quot;platforms&quot;.  But
<BR>
platforms do serve a purpose of condensing a lot of in the trenches
<BR>
discussion into a form that can be easily communicated.  But we
<BR>
should perhaps keep in mind a separation between E-THist philosophies
<BR>
and Futurist/Protechnology &quot;parties&quot; even though I would expect there
<BR>
will be a lot of overlap between these.
