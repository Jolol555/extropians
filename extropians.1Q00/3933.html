<EM>&gt; &gt;[Eugene Leitl knows] nothing about tethers or orbital towers. However, what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with hoisting rockets up to a tethered baloon (10..20 km height), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;launching them from there?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Darin Sunley:  The vast majority of the energy you spend to attain a stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbit is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building up your horizontal velocity relative to the ground, not fighting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gravity to gain 100+km of height.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  Launching from a high altitude allows you to use a lighter
<BR>
aeroshroud, but buys you surprisingly little other than that.  If you
<BR>
could launch from the top of Mt. Everest for example, the peak
<BR>
dynamic pressure on the nose is less than a third what it would
<BR>
be if launched from the deck.  Depending on the type of rocket
<BR>
that savings might be worthwhile in terms of payload capacity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You CAN launch from a couple km up. But it only buys you a vanishingly small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; % of the total energy you have to spend.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if we HAD a tower right up to LEO, you would still have to spend approx
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 80% of the energy (something in this neighborhood anyways) to get from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top of that tower to a stable orbit at that altitude.
</EM><BR>
<P>This isnt right tho.  Remember in the rockets it is momentum that is conserved
<BR>
not energy.  Rockets are enormously wasteful of energy.  If a skyhook
<BR>
existed, one could climb sufficiently high on it, then let go of the cable
<BR>
and fall into orbit.  I just did a quick back of the envelope calc on that
<BR>
and it looks like if you climb one Earth diameter up the cable and let
<BR>
go, one would fall into a minimal orbit.  And, if you had an elevator
<BR>
that could climb a stationary cable, the energy expenditure would
<BR>
be a fraction of that expended by a rocket.
<BR>
<P>Doug Jones has likely already jumped on this.  I havent downloaded
<BR>
for several hours.
