<EM>&gt; We were debating discontinuing the effort when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only practical way into their mesa, an airplane, was stolen... spike

<EM>&gt; Spike, Spike, Spike, you just gotta get a script writer.  This has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same tragico-comedic line of several other films situated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mexico, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;.

<P>The strange part is I cut to the chase without covering the human
<BR>
drama angle.  This particular band of Juichals was contacted in
<BR>
1969 by a young couple who had managed to get back there
<BR>
with mules carrying supplies, medicines and knowledge of
<BR>
the outside world.  On a third trip back there 2 yrs later, the
<BR>
couple was set upon by theives who were evidently disappointed
<BR>
that most of the cargo was books.  They shot the husband, raped
<BR>
and shot the wife, left them for dead, but both were still alive.  
<BR>
The young lady managed to get help and they retrieved her husband 
<BR>
but he perished soon afterwards.  Her testimony in the states 
<BR>
started the effort to help this particular isolated people, but 
<BR>
as bad luck would have it, the original pair were Catholic 
<BR>
missionaries, so... she insisted that the Juichals not be given 
<BR>
birth control devices.  And so it goes.
<BR>
<P>Robert, do those movies you mentioned base their story lines on
<BR>
the actual indigenous people of Mexico?  
<BR>
<P>Heeeyyyyy, now that you mention it, your comment has me
<BR>
thinking.  Do you suppose we benefactors were hoodwinked?
<BR>
Could the whole story have been just made up?  I have seen 
<BR>
photos of the missionary with the Juichals, but now that I 
<BR>
think it over, it *could* have all been a trick to extract 
<BR>
lots of American dollars from trusting do-gooders.  Man what 
<BR>
a scam that would be!  She could take the story to a number 
<BR>
of *different* groups which knew not each other and perhaps
<BR>
had no contact with each other, collect big bucks from
<BR>
each and...  {8^D  haaaa!  If we were all scammed, the whole
<BR>
adventure is funny enough I wouldnt begrudge her my
<BR>
donation, just for being able to relate the story.  
<BR>
<P>The more I think of it the more the whole notion grows on
<BR>
me.  We were ripe for a con.  As far as I know here is a
<BR>
system totally without checks and balances.  She never
<BR>
actually *showed* us the scar from the bullet.  There is no
<BR>
way we could know for sure, but we might have been taken
<BR>
in by the fact that this benefactress wasnt *asking* for
<BR>
much: just some medicine, sanitary supplies etc, nothing
<BR>
very expensive, but if one were to perpetrate a con, this
<BR>
is exactly how one would set it up!  For you see, it requires
<BR>
an airplane to get into this rugged country, and that is
<BR>
where all the bucks went and now the airplane is gone, and
<BR>
those evil drug dealers of course are surely to blame!
<BR>
Robert!  We were so unskeptical!  I think we've been had! 
<BR>
Haaaa!  hahahahah!  spike  {8^D
