<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; What database?  Where can I see it for myself.  If as you say, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;undeniable&quot; then I won't deny it.  I doubt however that there is any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;proven&quot; and &quot;undeniable&quot; evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;FBI Database of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even remotely close to &quot;undeniable.&quot;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Better than any other source. Show me anything more credible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure everyone knows that crime has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been steadily decreasing recently.  *Nothing* I have ever seen attributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this trend to the large number of guns circulating in society.  You might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to check out what the National Center for Policy Analysis has to say on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this count.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>The NCPA is an avowed leftist socialist anti-gun lobbying group. They
<BR>
woulnd't know the truth if it slapped them with a wet noodle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I can also retort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;against criminals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As to the need for such cartoons, suit yourself.  As for the words you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be trying to put in my mouth, I never said, or suggested, any such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You quite vehemently supported the same for the opposition. If you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;one way, don't support the other..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You misinterpreted my comment.  What I said was &quot;As to the need for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cartoons, suit yourself.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P>NO, you said the following, on Sun, 12 Mar 2000 19:42:40 PST:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;endquote&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Therefore, you were arguing in support of more cartoons. Stopy lying. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What this means is, if you want to publish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cartoons lampooning my opinions and people like me who hold them, suit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself.  In other words, go for it, have at it, cartoon away...I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; care.  Comprendo?
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you get bothered when people catch you in a lie?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Do you really want to continue?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if you can turn down the posturing and the rhetoric and turn up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; facts and a *reasonable* debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I didn't start it, you did. I'm all for reasonable debate. Just the facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, just the facts, huh?  Lets start with your claim that the FBI Database
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995, somehow supports your assertion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;guns are what keeps (sic) as many people in this country in circulation as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.&quot;  And that this assertion is, in your own words, &quot;Proven fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; undeniable.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where *exactly* can any such &quot;facts&quot; be gleaned from the FBI Database of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Crime Statistics, 1979 to 1995?  Reference to web page would be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only analysis done of ALL statistics in the database done was by
<BR>
Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago. He found the
<BR>
following, based completely on the statistics:
<BR>
<P>a) For every 1% increase in the number of citizens with Concealed Carry
<BR>
permits, crime drops by an average of 1%.
<BR>
b) The death penalty, as it is currently administered, has no positive
<BR>
or negative effect on the crime rate.
<BR>
c) Violent crime drops by an average of 8% one year after a state passes
<BR>
a 'shall-issue' reform of its concealed carry statues (versus
<BR>
discretionary issue statutes).
<BR>
d) Spree type killings (more than one murder per incident) drop by an
<BR>
average of 80% within 5 years of passage of such concealed carry laws.
<BR>
<P>he found a bunch of other things out, but these are the most salient
<BR>
points. Read his book, _More Guns, Less Crime_ before you dismiss this.
