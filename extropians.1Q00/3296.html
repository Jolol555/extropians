<P>
Spike,
<BR>
<P>I just wanted to say how much your posts on how to raise children with the 
<BR>
appropriate values has touched me and gotten me thinking.
<BR>
<P>I think I may have liked your grandfather!  Actually, I thought his advice 
<BR>
was sound.  Knowing auto repair can give a person a real advantage in life. 
<BR>
At least before so much electronics got installed in them! lol  But still, 
<BR>
it can save you money to do your own repairs and for those on a limited 
<BR>
income that can mean the difference between driving the car or taking the 
<BR>
bus.  Also it can (sometimes) save you time by doing your own auto repair.  
<BR>
I can see the virue of arguements that explain that learning auto repair can 
<BR>
teach problem solving and increase cognitive power.  Lastly, woman like a 
<BR>
guy who can work on their car!
<BR>
<P>Self-defense is still a very vital skill to have!  Despite the high-tech 
<BR>
veneer on our society, it can still be very violent.  Self-defense can give 
<BR>
a person peace of mind and a fighting chance to protect themselves and 
<BR>
others in situations where there is no other option.  I would want any child 
<BR>
of mine, male or female, to have a good working knowledge of self-defense.
<BR>
<P>My heart went out to you when you desribed the fearful environment that 
<BR>
existed when you attended college.  I remember faintly as a young teen the 
<BR>
news reports of the recession and the tight job market.  At least it helped 
<BR>
you gain motivation to work hard in school, get good grades and graduate.  
<BR>
That was something when you tore out that picture of the young homeless 
<BR>
family and enscribed a message to yourself on it and then put it up in plain 
<BR>
sight as a constant reminder!  Alot of college students today could use some 
<BR>
of your motivation, myself included.  It is sad that you did not major in 
<BR>
your academic first love.
<BR>
<P>The ramen noodles and koolaid diet is not healthy!  I have been on it 
<BR>
myself.  Though you obviously did, I wonder how people can learn and 
<BR>
function optimally on a diet like that?  I guess the good nutrition you had 
<BR>
in your formative years saw you through those four years.  I think if any 
<BR>
group should be properly fed it is those in college.  I am saddened also by 
<BR>
stories of gradeschool kids who cannot concentrate in school because they 
<BR>
are so hungry.
<BR>
<P>I can see how frustrating it must be to be a professional engineer, working 
<BR>
very hard but being financially outclassed by a child whose father invested 
<BR>
wisely on her behalf in companies you did not have the insight then to 
<BR>
invest in!
<BR>
<P>There are alot of people who are still working poor and just barely get by.  
<BR>
They work to eat and have shelter, not to buy toys for grownups.  You are 
<BR>
very blessed compared to them.  Of course, you had the self-discipline to 
<BR>
attend college and do well and at least some poor have a lack of that or did 
<BR>
when they were without kids.  And not everyone has the intelligence to study 
<BR>
a fairly high paying field like engineering.
<BR>
<P>Children/young adults like her will have their own challenges though.  It 
<BR>
would be easy to be lazy and be an adult spoiled brat and not develop one's 
<BR>
full potental in education, career and relationships.  The curse of the 
<BR>
trustfund kid.  Then there are those who earn the money themselves at a 
<BR>
young age and then must decide what new goals to set.  I don't see them as 
<BR>
being as troubled.
<BR>
<P>you wrote:
<BR>
No matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to say
<BR>
that hard work no longer matters, only correct investment
<BR>
strategy.  That goes so hard against everything I have
<BR>
always believed, I just cannot grok that message.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree!  I think that even in a world of mature nanotech, hard work will 
<BR>
still be important for status and to attract mates.  And as for the present, 
<BR>
it is hard work to invest properly and often people do just ok in their 
<BR>
investments or even lose their shirt!  And doesn't it take hard work to get 
<BR>
the money to invest in the first place?  So you still need a career or job 
<BR>
of some sort.  Being educated is more important then ever.  I can see how 
<BR>
teaching entreprenaurship could be very important for the young people of 
<BR>
today and tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>We will be a bunch of sad, old extropians if the scenario you gave comes 
<BR>
true.  A world of much greater prosperity then even now but with a lack of 
<BR>
respect for privacy and civil liberties.  I hope that is not the case.

<BR>
The specific life-lessons that earlier generations passed on will doubtless 
<BR>
be of less and less value. But the core concepts of rational self-reliance 
<BR>
seem to me to be timeless. It ought to be possible to teach these in almost 
<BR>
any circumstance.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P><P>The many posts on this topic have been excellent and I enjoyed Greg's 
<BR>
perceptive comment above.  Teaching young people to be educated and caring 
<BR>
individuals ready for the future will be a great challenge.  I wish good 
<BR>
luck to any parents on the list.
<BR>
