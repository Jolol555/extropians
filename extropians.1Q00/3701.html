<P><EM>&gt; Obviously there has been considerable variation in the longevity rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure from year to year and from decade to decade.  The trend has not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been very stable.  Generally we have been in the .1 to .3 range for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last several decades.  At this point it looks to me like we would need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a major new breakthrough to start this figure heading up towards 1.0.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some of the variation caused by murder &amp; accident rate changes.
<BR>
I think the '70's and '80's were fairly violent (young, impulsive
<BR>
baby boomer's perhaps???).
<BR>
<P>The key breakthroughs we need are:
<BR>
&nbsp;- reduce cancer mortality
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(looks like we get that with angiogenesis inhibitors)
<BR>
&nbsp;- general replacement organs (next 10 years or so)
<BR>
&nbsp;- drugs to inhibit brain damage during strokes/heart attacks
<BR>
&nbsp;- reversing protein glycosylation damage (drugs undergoing tests now)
<BR>
&nbsp;- a good understanding of all growth factors (5-10 years)
<BR>
&nbsp;- understanding the molecular biology of aging (5-15 years)
<BR>
&nbsp;- understanding the causes for and developing cures for genetic diseases
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10-20 years)
<BR>
&nbsp;- Safer cars, guns &amp; other hazards (ongoing).
<BR>
&nbsp;- Nanomedicine (20-30 years)
<BR>
&nbsp;- Weather control (???)
<BR>
