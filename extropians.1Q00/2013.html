<EM>&gt; 2. Suppose there are about 20 people in the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that the so-called &quot;USA political system&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a hoax;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should these people keep quiet about the hoax, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they attempt to expose it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. If some of these 20 people decide to attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hoax, how should they go about it?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends- do they care if they get hurt in the
<BR>
process? If they don't, they can do just about
<BR>
anything they want as long as it reaches the public
<BR>
-shouting on street corners, internet postings,
<BR>
newspapers (providing of course that these aren't
<BR>
being censored on the topic), etc., and just watch out
<BR>
whenever the sharpshooters start taking aim on the
<BR>
roof. Their attempt to break the secret out into
<BR>
public display would probably be short, bloody, and
<BR>
quickly buried. Although that in itself could be
<BR>
considered suspscious...'whydaya think the anarchist
<BR>
was found shot through the head, joe bob?'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they want to stay in one piece, that would be
<BR>
beyond stupid.*shrugs*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, don't vote for anybody who you think might
<BR>
be tied in with the hoax. Don't let your parents vote
<BR>
for them either. And what kind of hoax is it? A small
<BR>
one not unlike some of the ones that have
<BR>
theorectically gone on  through history...or one of
<BR>
the X-files-like scenarios? I'd think talking about it
<BR>
during small 'dinner parties'... dragging in as many
<BR>
people as possible... a lot like what revolutionaries
<BR>
and rebels have done throughout time. If there's
<BR>
people in other countries aware of it, their course of
<BR>
action would depend entirely on their place in
<BR>
society... meetings of course could be held, if 
<BR>
they're in politics themselves, they could bring it up
<BR>
possibly....*mutters something to herself* Is this
<BR>
with or without bloodshed? Most deep conspiracies or
<BR>
hoaxes would probably result in a lot of bloodshed
<BR>
upon being discovered. *glances at the clock and
<BR>
groans* Nevermind. Read the little I have written and
<BR>
laugh merrily, for I very much doubt it to be either
<BR>
understandable or worth the dissection.
