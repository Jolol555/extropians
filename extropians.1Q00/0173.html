to at least not engage in bi-partisan deck stacking.&quot;]
<BR>
<P>Matt:
<BR>
<P>I hate to say it, but this is nothing new. The power structure selects its
<BR>
winner by systematically de-selecting anyone they don't want in power.
<BR>
<P>In the debate at Washington University in St. Louis between Perot, Bush and
<BR>
Clinton the Libertarians had tried for almost a year to be included. The
<BR>
debate commission
<BR>
(a private group - not accountable to anyone) came up with minimum rules to
<BR>
be included in the debate. The ﬁrst rule they
<BR>
invented was that you had to be on the ballot in all 50 states. When Andre
<BR>
Marrou then got on the ballot in all the states they invented ever more
<BR>
exclusive
<BR>
and arbitrary rules with the primary purpose of excluding him.
<BR>
<P>CSPAN at the time thought this was an interesting news story and scheduled
<BR>
an interview with Marrou on the Wash U campus during the debate fracas. When
<BR>
Marrou arrived he was told he wasnt allowed on campus. When he told them that
<BR>
he had an interview with CSPAN he was still denied access. Finally one of the
<BR>
CSPAN producers walked by and noticed he was be held up. The CSPAN producer
<BR>
informed the policeman that Mr. Marrou was going to be interviewed in 10
<BR>
minutes
<BR>
or something and he was still denied access. The CSPAN interviewer then came
<BR>
down and still could not get him in front of the camera.
<BR>
<P>Are you seeing a pattern here?
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, the St. Louis Libertarians (who were still laboring under the
<BR>
delusion
<BR>
that we lived in a democratic republic) staged a peaceful protest on campus
<BR>
during
<BR>
the debates. Mind you, the campus was still open to the public at the time.
<BR>
We had people in their seventies down to little people like my son who was
<BR>
barely
<BR>
three years old in the protest. For some of us this was the ﬁrst time we had
<BR>
staged any sort of protest in our lives. For others who were hippies in the
<BR>
60's
<BR>
it was one of many.
<BR>
<P>As we walked down the sidewalk on campus the students of Wash U watched.
<BR>
Certainly
<BR>
a more unlikely group had never protested there. Then the magic happened.
<BR>
<P>One of our group was acting photographer for the event. He was nonchalantly
<BR>
taking
<BR>
pictures as we marched. At this point some security people (don't know
<BR>
exactly who)
<BR>
started separating students from protesters. I got a very uneasy feeling
<BR>
about that - a sure sign that something was happening. Suddenly a city
<BR>
policewoman
<BR>
(this was in the county) lunged at the photographer shouting &quot;I know what
<BR>
your doing&quot;
<BR>
or something close to that. The photographer, a very &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; type,
<BR>
kept yelling
<BR>
&quot;I'm not resisting arrest&quot;. After this another couple city policeman jumped
<BR>
on top
<BR>
and between the three of them damaged the nerves in the photographers arm.
<BR>
He was
<BR>
arrested by the city cops and thrown in the city tank. Again this happened in
<BR>
St. Louis County. (more about this later).
<BR>
<P>As this was happening I started shouting &quot;get it on video, get it on
<BR>
video&quot;. One
<BR>
of the libertarians had a high-band 8mm on him and got most of it on video.
<BR>
After
<BR>
this incident some ninjas in full black camo and balaclavas appeared out of
<BR>
nowhere.
<BR>
It was like some surreal nightmare. They had the largest German shepherds
<BR>
I've ever
<BR>
seen and MP5 submachine guns. They surrounded the entire group and held us at
<BR>
gunpoint behind a high fence at a softball ﬁeld. All the while media
<BR>
personalities
<BR>
(including reform party people) streamed by. Many of them who knew us. Not a
<BR>
single one was curious. Not a single one covered the event later. I can't tell
<BR>
you the images it conjured up. Typical citizens: men, women, children,
<BR>
young and
<BR>
old, wealthy and poor, held (technically under arrest) by stormtroopers
<BR>
armed with
<BR>
true assault weapons and *german* shepherds behind fences for their beliefs.
<BR>
<P>It is times like this when the veil of bullshit surrounding the United
<BR>
States as
<BR>
we know it is pulled aside and the true creature emerges. I would have to say
<BR>
it was a deﬁning moment for many of us politically. The moment when we realized
<BR>
that we no longer lived in anything resembling a free republic - the moment
<BR>
when
<BR>
I realized that trying to change the system by getting some of our people
<BR>
elected
<BR>
was a joke that would be funny if it were not so sad. The moment when you
<BR>
realize
<BR>
this country is ruled by an oligarchy with and iron hand in a velvet glove.
<BR>
<P>Then you go back to the &quot;normal&quot; world with ABCNews reporting election returns
<BR>
as if it mattered. And its if the curtain had been pulled back momentarily
<BR>
by Toto
<BR>
and we saw the &quot;the Great and Terrible Oz&quot; pushing buttons, yelling into
<BR>
the mike
<BR>
and saying &quot;pay no attention to the man behind the curtain&quot;. And then it was
<BR>
gone.
<BR>
<P>Well folks, the man behind the curtain has german shepherds and MP5 submachine
<BR>
guns. He comes out occasionally when citizens of this country wake from their
<BR>
slumber and want to change what is going on.
<BR>
<P>He puts them back to sleep.
<BR>
