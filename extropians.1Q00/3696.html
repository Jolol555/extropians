<P><EM>&gt; I've been considering carrying a &quot;captain's gig&quot; on my truck.  I've thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a mountain bike , a &quot;scooter&quot; and/or a motorcycle.  A recumbant bike might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work.  Have you any recommendations regarding brand etc?
</EM><BR>
<P>Im not hard core, Ev.  The recumbents are inherently spendy,
<BR>
because they are low production.  The bike-E looks like a good
<BR>
performance/cost compromise, at less than $800 for the midline
<BR>
model, which gives you a high-backed seat.
<BR>
<P>Bicycling gets ones heart involved better than just hiking.
<BR>
A lot of us realize where we are in the history-of-technology
<BR>
timeline: its becoming clearer all the time that if we can just
<BR>
take good enough care of ourselves to last a few more years,
<BR>
we will be still be living into the years of reeeaaaally bitchin life
<BR>
extension technology.  My apologies in advance to those
<BR>
who believe all that stuff really is only 5 to 10 yrs off.  Im
<BR>
pretty sure it is longer than that, 20-30 for instance, before
<BR>
we have the tech to theoretically extend life out to 150 yrs.
<BR>
<P>Question please: is there a term for the point in history where
<BR>
life extension technology is increasing our life expectancy one
<BR>
year for each year one lives, such that the mathematical
<BR>
expectation of ones remaining life stops decreasing?  That
<BR>
point I suspect is 20-30 yrs away.
<BR>
<P>Wait, now I further realize that this point may have already
<BR>
been achieved for those who are under 10 yrs now, and that
<BR>
life extension techniques will likely be less effective for those
<BR>
already aged.  This has surely already been hashed out, I just
<BR>
missed it somehow.  spike
