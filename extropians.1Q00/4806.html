<P><EM>&gt; Is it not true that the NRA opposes virtually *every* single piece of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gun-control legislation that comes down the pike?  Is it not true that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  NRA opposes any attempt reduce the production of new guns?  Is it not true 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that the NRA is opposed to reducing the number of guns now in circulation?

&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Is it not true that there are more guns in America than there are

Americans?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Is it not true that the NRA sees no problem with the ratio of guns to

<EM>&gt;  people?  Please stop me when I've said something that is not true.

I don't have a problem with any of the above....sounds like pretty good ideas 
<BR>
to me.
