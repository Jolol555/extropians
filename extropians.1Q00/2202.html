Greg, I think your piece has too many claims and not enough support.  I agree 
<BR>
with almost everything you say, but I think somebody with no strong opinion 
<BR>
on Rifkin or cloning would just blip over it.  Opponents of Rifkin will find 
<BR>
little useful new information - they can already assert Rifkin's flaws.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the editorial length restriction allows you to bring in 
<BR>
&quot;Entropy: a new world view&quot;, even in your longer form.  However, Rifkin 
<BR>
claims in EANWV that he is opposed to anything that increases the entropy of 
<BR>
the environment.  That includes all living organisms, so Rifkin is literally 
<BR>
anti-life by his own definition.  I don't think my potshot is rhetorical, 
<BR>
either - Rifkin seems genuinely opposed to creativity, expansionist 
<BR>
tendencies, and other such fundamental characteristics of life.
