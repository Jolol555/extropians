There was a funny joke about uploading (they called it downloading) on
<BR>
Friends this past week (a rerun episode I hadn't seen before).  Ross (the
<BR>
paleontologist) is telling Chandler about this book he read about how in
<BR>
30 years computers will be as complex as human brains, so we'll be able to
<BR>
download all our thoughts and memories into the computer, and live forever
<BR>
as machines.  Chandler is totally bored by this techno gobbledegook.
<BR>
<P>In the tag at the end, nerdy Ross starts telling Joey's hot new roommate
<BR>
(played by supermodel Elle McPherson) the same thing, about how
<BR>
computers will be as complex as brains in 30 years, and she breaks in
<BR>
enthusiastically and says yeah, we'll be able to download our thoughts
<BR>
and memories into the computer and live forever as machines!  Joke is
<BR>
that the geeky guy with the boring techno talk gets the attention of
<BR>
the gal...
