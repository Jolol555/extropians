<P>&lt;&lt; From a rationally selfish point of view, the reason I grant

&nbsp;rights to people is that interacting with people in an environment

&nbsp;of such rights generates advantages for me: specialization, trade,
<BR>
&nbsp;reciprocity, etc.  I live a better life because I choose to support
<BR>
&nbsp;and work within a system of human rights.  When short-term narrow
<BR>
&nbsp;circumstances change that dynamic--such as when I am being robbed
<BR>
&nbsp;at gunpoint--I would not hesitate to sacrifice another human life
<BR>
&nbsp;to save my own because that after all is my final goal: my life.
<BR>
&nbsp;It may be that I can accrue some benefits by supporting a system
<BR>
&nbsp;that grants some such rights to apes.  I can't enumerate them, but
<BR>
&nbsp;nor can I rule them out.  But unless I can justify this grant in
<BR>
&nbsp;selfish terms, I find it difficult to support rationally.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a slightly different view of morality, but let's see if I can't 
<BR>
make an 
<BR>
argument for why it might be of benefit to you to support a society in which 
<BR>
the Great Apes have rights.  If you grant that the Great Apes have features 
<BR>
that allow their classification as people, features which you share with 
<BR>
them, 
<BR>
then if you do not grant those Great Apes rights, might not someone else 
<BR>
take away your rights should it prove convenient to them?  This has happened 
<BR>
to humans many times in the past, and it has caused much sufferring.  Of 
<BR>
course, in societies which countenance such actions, there is no guarantee 
<BR>
that you will be on the beneficiary side.  Also, remember that strength as 
<BR>
well 
<BR>
as utility are relative things.  This century you, by being a human, are in a 
<BR>
position of power, and humans are by and large the most useful species on 
<BR>
the planet.  But who knows what might happen in the future?  Suppose, for 
<BR>
example, that for biological IA adult humans are in some sort of biological 
<BR>
rut making IA very difficult, but by some quirk of evolution some adult 
<BR>
Great Apes are not.  Then someone might uplift them to a greater level 
<BR>
then you know hold, and then what kind of society might they learn from the 
<BR>
old humans?  Creating a society ahead of time where all persons are respected 
<BR>
and their rights honored gives protection to us all for those times when we 
<BR>
are weaker and in need of help.
