<EM>&gt; Years ago I read an article about Milton Friedman (David's father), 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he didn't like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Federal Reserve Board, he didn't like its unpredictability and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he didn't like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its futile attempts to fine tune the economy and second guess the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He suggested the Fed be abolished and the money supply be regulated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer with all its programs made a matter of public record. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember the details or even where I read it, does anybody know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything?

<P><P>Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, is a 'monetarist',
<BR>
meaning that he believes the rate of overall price inflation tends to be
<BR>
determined by the difference between the rate of increase of the money
<BR>
stock (sometimes called money supply), and the rate of increase of the
<BR>
physical volume of production and provision of services (net of capital
<BR>
consumption).  To put it another way, monetarism says that the overall
<BR>
price index tends to be in proportion to the ratio of the money stock
<BR>
divided by the physical volume of goods and services produced per unit of
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P><P>To give a simple example, suppose there is an economy in which the only
<BR>
activities are that people raise potatoes and apples, which they buy and
<BR>
sell amongst themselves for dollars, and that all the potatoes and apples
<BR>
which are produced are eaten within a short time of when they are
<BR>
produced.  Monetarism would say (in this example) that if potato and
<BR>
apple production each go up by 10%, and the money stock increases by 15%,
<BR>
the prices of potatoes and apples will go up by about 5%.
<BR>
<P><P>In the 1960s, Friedman put forth the idea that if the Fed tinkers with
<BR>
the rate of growth of the money supply (money stock, more properly) in a
<BR>
well-meaning attempt to stabilize the business cycle and promote healthy,
<BR>
sound economic growth, that policy is likely to result in more economic
<BR>
instability than if the money supply is simply increased steadily at a
<BR>
moderate fixed rate, regardless of what the momentary economic conditions
<BR>
may be.  Friedman recommended picking a money supply growth rate between
<BR>
3% and 5%, and sticking with that as a strict guide for monetary policy. 
<BR>
That way, overall price inflation would be modest, say about 0% to 2%,
<BR>
assuming that the population grows at 1% per year and the real
<BR>
productivity of labor grows by 2% per year.  Individual prices could of
<BR>
course vary up and down.
<BR>
<P><P>Possible problems with implementing Friedman's recommendation in practice
<BR>
is that in a credit-based money system the definition of the money stock
<BR>
is somewhat arbitrary, and the velocity of circulation of money could
<BR>
change.  At any given time, M1, M2, and M3 might each be growing at
<BR>
different rates.  In theory, a free market credit-based money system (no
<BR>
Fed, no bank reserve requirements) would result in overall average price
<BR>
stability, due to the natural corrective feedback between market interest
<BR>
rates and the overall rate of change of prices.
