<EM>&gt;&quot;The human take on God and the afterlife&quot; should be treated as a problem??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What other &quot;take&quot; could there be, unless we vastly expand the scope of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our inquiry to include putative extraterrestrial cultures?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why should any belief-system be treated as a problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>The belief system of other people is only a problem for you when, because of 
<BR>
that belief system other people feel the need to impact your life.  For 
<BR>
instance, many of the fundamentalist Muslim stripe consider western 
<BR>
civilization in general (and the US in particular) to be the agent of Satan. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, their belief system leads them to do things like blow up things 
<BR>
which belong to the west.  Is that a problem?  I think so.
<BR>
<P>A little closer to home we have the fundamentalist Christians, some of whom 
<BR>
feel it is their devine duty to thwart the efforts of Satan by blowing up 
<BR>
abortion clinics, outlawing abortion, blocking the recognition of same-sex 
<BR>
marriages, and prohibiting scientific research which is offensive to their 
<BR>
Judeo-Christian ethic or encroaches on the domain of their Creator (much of 
<BR>
which is of great value to our Extropian hopes).  Is that a problem?
<BR>
<P>Hey, I'm a live and let live kind of guy.  Believe whatever nonsense you 
<BR>
want.  Just don't ruin *my* day with *your* beliefs.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
