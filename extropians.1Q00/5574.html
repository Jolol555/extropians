Rather long winded, but what your argument comes down to is that the US
<BR>
government is going to be able to protect its citizens from all future
<BR>
attacks (because if even one of these attacks succeeds it could probably
<BR>
kill every single person). Not to mention that the other countries will
<BR>
have practically no defenses. You also don't even address the worries
<BR>
about bio and AI attacks. Let me point out that not all terrorists are
<BR>
&quot;lone wolves&quot; acting on their own. Take for example the Aum Shinri Kyo
<BR>
cult of Japan that had many scientists, and was able to develop chemical
<BR>
and biological weapons in the 90s. I think your argument that in the
<BR>
future these types of groups will not be able to afford or have the
<BR>
expertise to create advanced technologies is wrong. I also think your
<BR>
belief that the US government (not the mention the other countries of
<BR>
the planet) is going to be able to protect its citizens from every
<BR>
possible bio, AI, and nano attack is seriously flawed. This is the
<BR>
same government that barely understands the Internet! Technology in
<BR>
many areas is outpacing them.
<BR>
<P>I think we are going to have take responsibility for protecting our
<BR>
individual selves rather than relying on the government if we want to
<BR>
have any chance of surviving. The only question is what area to focus
<BR>
our efforts on- bio, AI, or nano?

<EM>&gt; Do you ever get the feeling that just plain ol' luck is behind much of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens in life?  Are the Bill Joys, Alfred Noyces, Bill Gateses, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really supreme geniuses, or did they just win some kind of global lottery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No question, that when opportunity knocks, you have to get up and answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the door.  But you also have to live in the right neighborhood, and be at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home at the time.  You could add to that, your parents answering their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respective doors before you, and their parents before them.  An amazing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; string of sevens at the cosmic crap table leads to the founding of a Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsystems, an Intel, or a Microsoft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have no doubt that Bill Joy is a very talented software architect.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would surprise me a whole heck of a lot if most of the folks on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list couldn't have done all that Bill Joy did, had they been in his shoes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when opportunity--the silicon revolution--came knocking.  Read the bio part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of his wired article.  Between the lines I got the impression that when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was at Berkeley, buried beneath his work, the OTHER Sun Microsystems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; founders came and found him.  Dragged him off.  Now he thinks he's hot shit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Mommy, mommy, the future scares me!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Go back to Aspen, Bill.  Write some more code.  The future doesn't need YOU.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I listened to the NPR program.  I have a coupla of comments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill says we should pause, and think about the wisdom of proceeding with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these scary technologies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The future is coming, Bill.  Like a juggernaut.  There'll be no slowing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down.  A billion people in India (substantial numbers of programmers riding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wave of the silicon revolution) and more than a billion people in China
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want a decent standard of living and they're counting on future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies to deliver it for them.  To slow down the future, you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to nuke them.  Are you going to nuke them, Bill?  I didn't think so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then listen to them laugh at you, Bill, as you sit on your deck, and sip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your latte, in your palatial mansion in trendy Aspen, Colorado.  And listen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the future roaring in on you, on us all, unstoppable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill says the scary terrorist may get us all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Done a lot of sitting in your luxuriously appointed office, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breathtaking view of the Colorado Rockies, listening to your yes men with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their bobbing heads, saying, &quot;Yes, Bill.  Yes, Bill.&quot; ?  Or perhaps, you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just spent too many years--your whole life?--staying up late writing code?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not a lot of experience with,...what do they call it?,...ah, yes, REALITY.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Try this, Bill.  The terrorist thing,...it's mostly a fabrication.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see, people like scary stories.  So the media puts out a whole lot of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Makes them lots of money.  The name Steven King mean anything to you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then there's the politicians.  They love the boogeyman.  The Kraut, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jap, the Commie, the fag, the jew, the arab, the narco-trafficker, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terrorist.  The politician says, &quot;The comm,...er,..terrorists are coming.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vote for me.  I'll save you.&quot;  Then, of course lately, what with peace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having broken out since the demise of the evil empire, the entire national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security beauracracy has been frantic to hustle up a new boogeyman.  Got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mortgages to pay, kids to feed.  International terrorism, that's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ticket.  But perhaps all the terrorist hype has overwhelmed you, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't see past it.  Try this instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The nanobots and biobots that frighten you so?, well you know, they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; huge military potential.  So before your demented evil genius terrorist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fiend, goes down to his corner &quot;Bot-R-Us&quot; store, with global mayhem--even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unto the extinction of the human race, including Bill and his kids--in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind,...  Before that happens, governments will have spent hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions of dollars and millions of man hours conjuring up every kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offensive use, defensive counter-measure, plan, strategy, scenario, weapons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, policy issue, cost-benefit analysis, yadda yadda yadda--enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make every taxpayer get down on his knees and pray for human extinction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What chance really, does your lone terrorist have against all those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources marshalled against his tender little psychosis?  Really Bill, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to get out more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, bottom line, this Wired article thing?  A major publishing coup for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wired News.  That's their business, and they done real good.  A super scary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; story about really scary high technology, even now emerging--as heralded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ta, taaa!, by Wired News-- from the semi-irrelevance of science fiction to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mind-shattering preeminence of science non-fiction, and brought to you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the much envied because he's very rich and very prestigious because he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very rich, wunderkind of the silicon digerati, trendy Aspen Branch,  no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joy, Killjoy, Bill Joy.  Yippeee!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Enjoy this momentary return to the spotlight, Bill, cause it looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puffery to me, and not likely to last.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                         Best, Jeff Davis
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;            &quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
