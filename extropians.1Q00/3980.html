<EM>&gt;(&quot;Matieralism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't explain emotions.&quot;) The answer for that is &quot;Yes it can, emotions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patterns of neuron firings in the brain.&quot; (c.f. Dennett, Hofstadter).

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm sick of seeing such basic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grevious conceptual errors as the above being made.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this is an accurate characterization of Dennett's view 
<BR>
(though it's been a while since I've read Dennett). He's a functionalist 
<BR>
not an identity theorist/reductive materialist, so this doesn't sound like 
<BR>
his view.
<BR>
<P>Same with this typical Dennett-drivel above. The firing of neurons BRINGS
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ABOUT emotions. The firing of neurons twaddle explains NOTHING about what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the resultant emotions actually *ARE*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is this blatantly obvious to anyone else?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, emotions clearly are more than neural firings. Other things are 
<BR>
involved such as levels of neurotransmitters, hormonal levels, and bodily 
<BR>
responses. But if you include those, then I would say that when we 
<BR>
experience emotions that is what we are experiencing. (Since I'm a 
<BR>
functionalist, I'd agree that we could experience the same things with 
<BR>
functionally-equivalent but physically different hardware.) I'm not sure of 
<BR>
your view from what you say, but I'd have to answer: No--it's not obvious 
<BR>
at all. I don't think these neural and chemical activities BRING ABOUT 
<BR>
emotions--they ARE the emotions (or, rather, the instantiation of these 
<BR>
emotions). What else do you think emotions are? Some non-physical stuff 
<BR>
floating around in the brain? Or perhaps you reject substance dualist but 
<BR>
go for some kind of strong property dualism? (A position I've never been 
<BR>
able to make sense of.)
<BR>
<P>I'm curious since I'm currently discussing this very topic in two of my 
<BR>
classes right now.
