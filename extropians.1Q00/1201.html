<EM>&gt; You would think wrongly, for the most part. Various experiments have shown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it's at a certain point after birth (sometimes as little as minutes),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a baby starts to develop certain cognitive skills, such as recognizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faces, or being able to tell when sound is in sync with image. The
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm referring to total mental development (which I took to be your
<BR>
meaning in your original post), not just specific cognitive abilities,
<BR>
such as language acquisition, face recognition, etc. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; developing fetus is presumably going through biological developments which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get it *ready* to being cognizing about the world, but how could the baby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employ those skills until it actually had some raw experience to chew on?
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't think it begins cognating while it's in the womb?? I'm sorry,
<BR>
I don't think there's anything *that* magical about birth. In the womb,
<BR>
the infant can experience a variety of different stimuli including: a
<BR>
wide range of acoustics, temperature changes, physical sensation
<BR>
(feedback from moving/kicking), etc. It also experiences much more
<BR>
subtle, but definitely no less influential, events such has hormones and
<BR>
other chemicals from the mother.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The single thing I have heard which suggests any significant cognitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development before birth was that a fetus may begin to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguish voices in the womb - I got this information in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psycho-linguistics class where the professor mentioned it in passing as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of &quot;the latest theories&quot; in child language acquisition. These other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments of psychological development, which shows them to occur at some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point *after birth*, can be found in any introductory psychology text
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (they're worth reading for the ingenius methodology employed, if nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, rigorous testing of fetuses in a solid experimental
<BR>
paradigm for specific, recognizable cognitive abilities has yet to be
<BR>
done on an informative scale. Unlike the relative ease with which you
<BR>
can conduct experiments on babies that have been born. Just because we
<BR>
haven't been able to test for it, or have tested for it poorly, does not
<BR>
mean it isn't happening. Just ask any expectant mother if they think
<BR>
their baby evinces reactions corresponding to her voice. While hardly
<BR>
scientific, the results of questions like that definitely good grounds
<BR>
for the start of a scientific hypothesis. I'll be the first to admit
<BR>
that developmental psychology wasn't really an area of interest for me,
<BR>
but apparently I remembered a few things on my way to a psychology MA.
<BR>
<P>I think what happened here is I mistook your initial comment about
<BR>
mental development to represent all of the cognitive processes
<BR>
throughout the entire developmental process of a child, rather than just
<BR>
those particular ones we have had the time, ability, inclination and
<BR>
resources to assess after its birth. Much more wishy-washy: I think if
<BR>
you were able to plot a graph of performance or progress on a number of
<BR>
specific and labeled cognitive skills you would see a significant,
<BR>
positive deviation from zero some time after conception but well before
<BR>
birth.
