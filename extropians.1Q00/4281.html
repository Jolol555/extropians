<EM>&gt;The reason why it is called the Bell Curve is because it is about

<P>The Bell Curve shows a statistical (but not an absolute) correlation between

various groups and IQ.

Likewise, one can show a statistical (but not an absolute) correlation between
<BR>
brain size and IQ.

Einstein had a smaller than average brain.

What you do with what you have may sometimes mean more than how much you have to

begin with. But until nano assemblers are as common as toasters, it's still

difficult to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
