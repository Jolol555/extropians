<EM>&gt; &gt; Most ham radio operators don't need to hide miniature transmitters that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; disguised as clocks or smoke detectors.  And there is a fine line between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; selling an illegal devices and selling Radio Shack parts and instructions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make an illegal device.
</EM><BR>
<P>But here we are back with the gun debate again (shudder).  There is a
<BR>
very strong line between possessing a device that has a legitimate
<BR>
&quot;hobbyist&quot; use (building the kit and testing it is educational) *and*
<BR>
making *use* of the device in an illegal &quot;wiretapping&quot; operation.
<BR>
My suspicion is that one of the reasons the &quot;wiretapping&quot; laws
<BR>
exist is to provide an extension of the right to not incrmininate
<BR>
oneself.
<BR>
<P>That &quot;right&quot; would provide some &quot;fascinating&quot; discussion, since
<BR>
&quot;rationally&quot;, if a person is guilty of a crime, we logically would
<BR>
want that individual to &quot;punished&quot;, whether or not he self-discloses
<BR>
or there is other-evidence with regard to the crime.  It is almost
<BR>
like we have a constitutional right to be criminals if we can hide
<BR>
it sufficiently!!!
<BR>
<P>Now of course the &quot;transparent&quot; society discussion will get fairly
<BR>
interesting, since &quot;public space&quot; observation would seem to be
<BR>
another form of &quot;eyewitness account&quot;, while &quot;private space&quot;
<BR>
observation would seem to involve violation of &quot;wiretapping&quot; laws.
<BR>
<P>But in any case, the kits are kits, not illegal uses and so long as they
<BR>
aren't violating FCC regulations I think the government is on shakey
<BR>
ground trying to prevent their sale.
