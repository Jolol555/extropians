Ubergoo:
<BR>
<P>That sounded like radical boilerplate to me.  I have nothing against
<BR>
radicals or revolutionaries, but the below has been said not only a million
<BR>
times but a million times better and is not only true but a) is preaching
<BR>
to the choir -- because the language would alienate a moderate b) denies
<BR>
that destruction that drugs commit daily even sans hang ups and buzzkill,
<BR>
etc...
<BR>
<P>Anything that even tries to mirror: &quot;Rise up and break the chains of
<BR>
Oppression&quot; coming out of anybody but an 18-year-old is going to responded
<BR>
to with rolled eyes, a big yawn, and force fields up.
<BR>
<P>We really must brainstorm on a better way to convey the hackneyed 60's
<BR>
boilerplate -- hath nothing been improved -- using &quot;break the chains of
<BR>
oppression&quot; even if it is &quot;unshackle your perception&quot; is not going to relax
<BR>
someone and it takes trust, relaxation, and slight of hand to pass a meme.
<BR>
Expecially one as big as you want.
<BR>
