Ok, I've kept silent long enough. CAVEAT, Brian the following is not directed at
<BR>
you. I believe you only relayed information so I'm not criticizing you or your
<BR>
opinion, I don't even know them. The comments below are for everyone.

<P>This is soo wrong. There are a number of reasons one can get dishonorably
<BR>
discharged from the military that have nothing to do with whether you are good
<BR>
enough for gun ownership.
<BR>
<P>Warning upcoming rant below:
<BR>
<P>I am truly surprised at all the rhetoric here. Let me explain. I gathered from
<BR>
all the Objectivist leanings here that personal liberty would be high on this
<BR>
lists list. Now I consider myself a moderate liberal but in some ways I would be
<BR>
more Libertarian than those of you claiming to be. Let me explain.
<BR>
<P>No one, no government, no man, no woman, no not even a deity has the right to
<BR>
tell me I cannot protect myself or my loved ones in like kind to what ever
<BR>
threatens me or my own. If those threatening me or my own happen to have guns or
<BR>
knives or baseball bats or whatever, then I have the right to have the same or
<BR>
better to protect my life and that of my loved ones. Who gave me that right? I
<BR>
DID! How's that for personal liberty?!
<BR>
<P>Quote statistics and theory till you are blue in the face, it means nothing.
<BR>
What does mean something, no what means EVERYTHING is MY life and the lives of
<BR>
those I love. I mean get real people. We are supposed to be Life Extensionists!
<BR>
How extended will your life be if some low life, that has no respect for his/her
<BR>
own life much less yours, decides to forcefully take something from you and caps
<BR>
you so you cannot identify or for simply the thrill? It happens, it's not just a
<BR>
hollywood cliché.
<BR>
<P>Of course I want something done to keep guns out of the criminals and other
<BR>
TRULY &quot;ineligibles&quot; hands. However, let's get real again. What good is an
<BR>
unloaded gun when the creep breaking your door down was at least clever enough
<BR>
to load his/hers before getting anywhere near you? Absolutely none, might as
<BR>
well not have it to begin with. Ever hear of the Darwin awards? That's what I'd
<BR>
give anyone that actually did put their bullets out of reach when it really
<BR>
counts.
<BR>
<P>One last thing. In an ideal world there would be no guns. Actually that's
<BR>
trivial. In an ideal world their would be no NEED of guns or anything else for
<BR>
self defense. We don't live in that world yet. Remove all the guns and their
<BR>
manufacturers somehow magically today and by tomorrow there'd be millions of
<BR>
them owned by guess who? That's right every miscreant, every lowlife, every
<BR>
psycho with even half a brain would have a home made, yes crude but effective,
<BR>
garage model and be knocking your door down because you likely will not have
<BR>
stooped as low.
<BR>
<P>Ok, done ranting. No need to plonk. I've said all I will say. I won't even
<BR>
respond to whatever objections you all may find against my logic. I believe if
<BR>
you reduce it to what's really important, your own and your loved ones precious
<BR>
and maybe even immortal lives--if we here have our fondest wishes come true, and
<BR>
then just use your imagination--dare to picture the worst actually happening to
<BR>
you yes even to you and yours, then you will have to agree that NO ONE has the
<BR>
right to FORCE you to be vulnerable.
