<P>
Overly-hyped sites are a dime a dozen for today's savvy Internet user. We
<BR>
hear the press via: usenet, mailing lists, email, banner ads, radio spots,
<BR>
billboards, and even television. However, only a handful are innovative.
<BR>
There are so few that I feel are actually testing the boundaries of things
<BR>
as they currently stand. So, when I hear about a site non-stop I'm rarely
<BR>
eager to go about promoting it from a personal level.
<BR>
<P>I'm skeptical and in the end come away from the sites usually thinking that
<BR>
there was little to offer, almost no creativity, and they couldn't leave me
<BR>
with a sense of excitement. This morning at 6:47am I finally made my way to
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.dotcomguy.com/">http://www.dotcomguy.com/</A>
<BR>
<P>I had heard the rumors, complaints, and praises of this site for days on
<BR>
end. I went in with my normal benevolence and came out a believer. Now for
<BR>
those of you that don't know about the idea, it is pretty simple although
<BR>
very ingenious. This man believes in the Internet (specifically e-commerce)
<BR>
so much that he is willing to spend a year in house and buy and do
<BR>
everything online. He started up Jan 1, 2000 with only the clothes on his
<BR>
back and a computer with a connection. That was it.
<BR>
<P>Now, for me to say, &quot;That was it.&quot; hardly goes into my fascination with this
<BR>
whole stunt. I just got the sense that this man was not only happy about
<BR>
life, the net, and the world around him. He is ready to put his whole
<BR>
existence on the line (no pun intended ;) just to prove how amazingly great
<BR>
technology is.
<BR>
<P>I won't say the site is all together so interesting at this point. It's
<BR>
still in the growth stages. I did enjoy the live cam that allows you in
<BR>
streaming form to not only see what he is up to but hear him as well. He was
<BR>
being interviewed this morning and showing a reporter around his house. One
<BR>
of the neat things he mentioned was, that he has a bedroom that has a green
<BR>
wall like a weather man would use. He will be able to project sites on to
<BR>
that wall and he will show people how to use the sites and so forth. He is
<BR>
one man promotional machine, and companies adore this media darling.
<BR>
<P>My point with all of this is to say that, fresh ideas are out there. A
<BR>
handful of people are ready to push limits and explore new areas of
<BR>
themselves and the Internet. I know that the people that are have these
<BR>
ideas are almost always Extropian in nature. So, I encourage you all, to
<BR>
venture out. If you have had a crazy idea floating around in your head for
<BR>
week, months, years on end, do it. And if you do, know that I'll be right
<BR>
there ready to support you all the way.
<BR>
<P>Jasmine
