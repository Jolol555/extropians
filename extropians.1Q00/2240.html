<P>Doug's ongoing efforts re: supplements (similar to some of the studies
<BR>
we did in Russia with both flies and mice) have got me thinking
<BR>
(oh nooo, the chorus in the background cries...).
<BR>
<P>It seems to me to be very clear that we will within the next
<BR>
few years have relatively inexpensive technologies (chips)
<BR>
to &quot;disassemble&quot; the aging process.  However, I've been worried
<BR>
for quite some time that &quot;disassembling&quot; the process does not
<BR>
equate with &quot;fixing&quot; the process.  Thus, some of you have seen
<BR>
me argue at Extro4 and on the list for things like sequencing
<BR>
elephant and newt genomes, molecular modeling of cells, etc.
<BR>
Why invent new solutions when we may be able to steal them from nature?
<BR>
<P>There is another approch that we as a group might be able to undertake.
<BR>
Namely, to replicate Michael Rose's work in breeding long lived
<BR>
individuals.  Michael and others have done this with Drosophila
<BR>
and now Michael has a low level effort attempting to do this in mice.
<BR>
<P>The question becomes are there other species that one might be able
<BR>
to use for similar experiments?  You could pick Drosophila but that
<BR>
has been done.  Another species of insect would probably yield
<BR>
results similar to the Drosophila.  What comes to my mind is some
<BR>
small short lived fish or reptile.  These would provide a different
<BR>
genetic background in which the genetic evolution of longevity
<BR>
could be studied.  The more of these that we can produce, the
<BR>
greater variety of solutions we might have that could be applied
<BR>
to the problem of human aging.
<BR>
<P>One of the problems with this is the longevity of most species
<BR>
is already quite a bit greater than Drosophila so the experiments
<BR>
take longer.  But Michael's work shows that one of the life
<BR>
extension strategies in nature is to make more &quot;robust&quot; animals.
<BR>
So, you might be able to accelerate the process by creating
<BR>
relatively &quot;harsh&quot; conditions for the experimental animals
<BR>
so that only those with genes that are beneficial in those
<BR>
harsh conditions manage to reproduce.  Things like higher
<BR>
temperatures or low level genotoxins come to mind as possible
<BR>
ways to select for more robust animals.  Once you had really
<BR>
robust individuals, you could go back and study whether this
<BR>
provided increased longevity as well.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions for species?
<BR>
Anyone interested in being a longevity breeder?
