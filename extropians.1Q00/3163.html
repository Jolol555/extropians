&quot;Subliminal Seduction&quot; was a popular topic in Psych 101 back in the early
<BR>
70's.  Is it still alive?

<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;And if you have the early laserdisc version of Who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Framed Roger Rabbit, there is a scene where Jessica Rabbit is doing some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind of flip and her dress comes up and genetalia is shown in a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frame. I seem to remember some similar scandal with The Little Mermaid but
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;don't recall it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think The Little Mermaid scandal was about what appeared to be a penis
<BR>
making up part of the sparkling, golden towers on the cover of The Little
<BR>
Mermaid video case. I have it at home and it does look like it. My Disney
<BR>
obsessed best friend said that in Aladdin, the word &quot;sex&quot; supposedly appears
<BR>
in the clouds and that Aladdin whispers &quot;take off your clothes&quot; in Jasmin's
<BR>
ear during the magic carpet ride scene. My friend mentioned other similar
<BR>
stuff in other Disney movies, but I don't remember the specifics.
