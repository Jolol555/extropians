<EM>&gt; I've always thought it would be a good idea to take a few pounds of

<P>I've always thought a Johnny Hempseed movement would be a good
<BR>
idea.  No vacant lot, roadside, ditch, or park should be without
<BR>
hemp.  It's a very hardy weed, should grow anywhere, or so say
<BR>
hemp activists.  One shouldn't be able to look at any
<BR>
non-landscaped public property without bearing witness to the
<BR>
absurdity and futility of making war against a plant.

<P>Fun idea.  I look forward to viewing the finished product. :)

</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  However, race could become a powerful factor in
<BR>
discontinuing prohibition.  Look up incarceration rates for
<BR>
black males.  Or how prohibition has wracked Columbia and other
<BR>
hispanic countries.  If advocates of freedom have any opportunity
<BR>
to play the feared &quot;race card&quot;, this is it.
