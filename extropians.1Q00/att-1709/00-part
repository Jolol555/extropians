  An interesting article on how "poor" our food chain really is,
  "Sickening Food" @
    http://www.sciencenews.org/20000122/food.asp

Quoting:
  "Last month, Paul S. Mead and his colleagues at the federal Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention offered up their latest estimate in a
   19-page report. Published in the September-October issue of Emerging
   Infectious Diseases, it concludes that some 76 million U.S. residents
   develop foodborne illness each year.

   That incidence rate would indicate that on average more than one in
   four people eat sickening food each year. The data also indicate that
   an estimated 325,000 require hospitalization—and almost 5,200 die
  —because of foodborne illness."

Now, when those anti-GenEng people are out their whining against
all of the problems Genetic Engineering is going to cause, its up
to all of *you* (Picture Robert Bradbury in his Uncle Sam cap
pointing a finger at the audience) to remind them that our lack
of hygenic production of our food supply *does* kill people.
