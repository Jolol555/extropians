<P>I bet!  A guy who is rich and wants to equally share the wealth!  Or at 
<BR>
least live based on the theory that everyone (or at least the beautiful 
<BR>
woman in his life) is automatically given the resources they need.  And the 
<BR>
needs of woman can be great!  Especially when needs fall into the wants 
<BR>
category!! ;)
<BR>
<P>At UAA there are alot of Russian students who are all studying business to 
<BR>
go back home and become hopefully rich and powerful while having developed a 
<BR>
tender spot in their heart for the good ole U.S. of A. while having been 
<BR>
here(I don't know about that).  Alot of them come from families that were 
<BR>
part of the old Communist elite power structure and some have very haughty 
<BR>
attitudes to be honest.  But others are from very humble backgrounds and got 
<BR>
their based on brains and hard work only(and maybe some connections, lol).  
<BR>
But I have made good friends with several and really enjoyed learning about 
<BR>
their homeland.
<BR>
<P>Very few Russian and American students become couples which initially 
<BR>
surprised me.  The Russians pair off among eachother almost always.  In a 
<BR>
way I feel much more in common with visiting Asian students! lol
<BR>
<P>Sometimes I think Russia must have had a secret genetic engineering project 
<BR>
going to produce the world's most beautiful women!  I cannot believe all the 
<BR>
gorgeous six foot tall blondes that 'just happen' to be Russian and 
<BR>
attending school here!  Of course, I have some fun mock arguments with 
<BR>
Russian guys over whose country has the prettiest women.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
