Hello,
<BR>
<P>I was thinking more about government debt structure as I know so little about it.  It
<BR>
can be assumed that a relatively wide variety of instruments are in place.  A large
<BR>
number are T-bonds that the Treasury has used to float Social Security money into
<BR>
government spending.  Now, they just call at least 1/4 of Social Security income
<BR>
&quot;on-budget&quot;, which is a convenient turn of phrase.
<BR>
<P>Some instruments are time-based, some have different fixed or varying interest rates
<BR>
and methods of capital repayment to diminish capital debt.
<BR>
<P>What we really would need here would be some damn good accountants.  They are not
<BR>
having too many clients with $4 trillion in debt, although thankfully at least the
<BR>
U.S. has a better credit rating than some other countries that shall remain nameless.
<BR>
<P>So the point here would be as possible to pay off all capital (principal, rather) that
<BR>
would be possible, to avoid any recurring interest rates that probably float high and
<BR>
compound continuously.  Eliminate this bad debt and consolidate into low interest
<BR>
fixed or capped rate instruments.  Perhaps terms of some instruments or bonds are that
<BR>
they have some term which is 20 or 30 years.  Anyways, consolidation would still be
<BR>
great as then the government funds could work more for each other.  It should be that
<BR>
the federal government has enough fiscal leverage to at all possible actually save the
<BR>
taxpayer's money as possible.
<BR>
<P>Here's to Zero-coupon bonds and the '80s, and some personal IRA's and partial opt-out
<BR>
of Social Security in return for protected personal investment.
<BR>
<P>So, where does a citizen find information on the U.S. debt structure, anyways?  Maybe
<BR>
CBO or something.

<P><EM>&gt; If the government defaults on its debt, which is to some extent made up of T-bonds

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be no more Social Security, and all of those citizens having given the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government peacefully their FICA taxes in return for expectation of minimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retirement income would find themselves bereft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is no point in the government carrying any debt, except to those collecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest on it.  Consider the statement that about 9 percent of gross federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income goes to pay interest on government debt.  That means out of every dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each citizen gives to the government, about a dime goes to service its debt.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a terrible thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors about the government's books.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can anyone say where is to be found the IRS breakdown of its income, that is, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pays what to the government?  It would be nice to have in one place all of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charts, graphs, and tables.  As it is if it's available it's not very.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I turn the recent 2001 proposed budget of the U.S. Federal Government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue:  it is not who watches the watchmen but who pays them.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; United States is benefitting from unheralded state of productivity growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; which rises, explicitly economically, from investment in research and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; development, and more vaguely Alan Greenspan, and very minorly, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; politician.  I am thinking that most people make more money than me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; thus paying more taxes, yet I am still interested in where my 1/3 of total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; monetary productivity given to the government does go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's where it should go:  paydown of the national debt.  The younger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; generation didn't make it and doesn't want it, and the baby boomers will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; living long enough that it would be bad for them if Social Security crashed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ross, many years ago I was a big anti-debt advocate (for the reasons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you outline).  I'm not so sure anymore.  I suspect that I could make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a pretty good case that properly directed government spending towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the development of an &quot;almost anything&quot; box will produce so much growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the near future, that the national debt is irrelevant.  Why do people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; buy bonds?  To have an income in the future.  Why do they need an income?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To meet their material requirements.  Now while Robin might disagree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that we don't throw away the economy overnight, I could see a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interesting scenario where the government develops an almost anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; box, puts it in the public domain and simultaneously defaults on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any remaining national debt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One thing I am pretty sure about is that in a few years, if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; becomes clear that biotech is going to significantly extend longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (e.g. William Haseltine, CEO of Human Genome Sciences, predicting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the Oct 18, 1999 WSJ Health and Medicine section, pg R10, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the life expactancy of people born in 2050 will be 150+ years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then Social Security will be permanently broken and the only way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out will be to invest in nanotech lifeboat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Robert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that growth is in a long term upswing, but planning on it is an invitation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to inflation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Properly directed government funding is that towards research and development, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far as I know the only indicator of increase in productivity, that is the rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase in productivity is linearly and positively linked to R&amp;D.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, people will grow older, and be older longer.  Social Security will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be reformed, as is evidenced by rising retirement ages.  Health care costs would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a rising burden, that would have to be solved.  At least by that time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary drug patents would be expired so that the government could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandated to purchase &quot;generic&quot; drugs in the majority of necessary cases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps at some point in the near future, the current retirement age could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correlated to life expectancy, then as life expectancy grew then the retirement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age would rise correspondingly.  We can expect that as life expectancy rises that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productive span increases as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About drug speech, Medicare prescription drug purchase sure would be a hell of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boon to pharmaceuticals who would be happy to charge the government for drugs that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the elderly might not need.  They should get the ones that they do need.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, about the fact that the U.S. government, over the course of its operations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has accrued a debt in the trillions, this is a problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Besides the debt and social security issue is the critical one of where each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen's taxes go below the incredibly broad level of a federal or state budget.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who is the government paying more than $300 billion for defense reasons, quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically?  This is a general statement about detecting and eliminating fraud
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the government, and thus of the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It still seems apparent that the government should endeavor to eliminate debt it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has incurred against the public monies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you explain what you mean by &quot;almost anything box&quot; some more.  If it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaning a nanotech or transmuter or combination, whoever makes one will become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rich.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ross
</EM><BR>
<P>If I had a combination matter transmuter/nanotech assembler I would make some
<BR>
chocolate mousse, from sand.  Ha ha.  The possibilities are, of course, phenomenal,
<BR>
especially with regards to matter to energy conversion and perhaps vice versa to power
<BR>
this device.  Then, you have some ethereal device that can produce anything from
<BR>
anything, science fiction, certainly.
