<P>Ray Kurzweil to Receive National Medal of Technology from President Clinton
<BR>
<P>February 1, 2000.  The White House announced this morning that Ray Kurzweil
<BR>
will receive the National Medal of Technology, the nation’s highest honor in
<BR>
technology, from President Clinton in a White House Ceremony on March 14,
<BR>
2000.
<BR>
<P>The citation on Mr. Kurzweil’s National Medal of Technology will read:
<BR>
<P>For pioneering and innovative achievements in computer science that have
<BR>
overcome barriers for and enriched the lives of disabled persons and of all
<BR>
Americans, including developing the first print-to-speech reading machine
<BR>
for the blind, the first commercially marketed large vocabulary speech
<BR>
recognition technology, and the ground-breaking Kurzweil 250 computer music
<BR>
keyboard.
<BR>
<P>Following is background information on the National Medal of Technology, and
<BR>
Ray Kurzweil’s Brief Biography released by the White House.
<BR>
<P>Background on the National Medal of Technology.
<BR>
<P>The National Medal of Technology is the nation’s highest honor in
<BR>
technology.   Enacted by Congress in 1980, the Medal has been awarded by the
<BR>
President of the United States each year since 1985.  It is awarded to
<BR>
several individuals (and/or groups of individuals) each year.  In most
<BR>
years, a company has also been honored.  There are no categories specified
<BR>
in the award.
<BR>
<P>Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley writes: “The National Medal of
<BR>
Technology is the Nation’s highest honor for technological achievement,
<BR>
presented annually by the President of the United States.  The men and women
<BR>
awarded the National Medal of Technology are those whose extraordinary works
<BR>
in research, development and design have made significant contributions to
<BR>
U.S. prosperity and competitiveness, our overall quality of life, and our
<BR>
understanding of the world around us.”
<BR>
<P>President Clinton, in his remarks at the April 27, 1999 White House ceremony
<BR>
bestowing the National Medal of Technology to the 1998 Laureates said “Your
<BR>
success in illuminating the hows and whys of our world and raising the
<BR>
quality of human existence have helped make the time in which we live
<BR>
perhaps the most exciting in human history. . . In an age when the entire
<BR>
store of knowledge doubles every five years, where prosperity depends upon
<BR>
command of that ever-growing store, the United States is the strongest it
<BR>
has ever been, thanks in large measure to the remarkable pace and scope of
<BR>
American Science and technology in the last 50 years. . .”
<BR>
<P>Ray Kurzweil’s Brief Biography Released by the White House
<BR>
<P>When Ray Kurzweil was developing the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the first
<BR>
print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, he worked closely with a team
<BR>
of blind engineers and scientists, not just to test the Kurzweil Reading
<BR>
Machine and design its user interface, but on all facets of this complex
<BR>
undertaking. It was a simple but pioneering design philosophy-work closely
<BR>
with the intended users of one’s inventions as key participants in the
<BR>
invention process. That philosophy combined with Kurzweil’s own innovative
<BR>
genius has led to a dazzling array of landmark inventions.
<BR>
<P>The Reading Machine itself has been called the most significant advance for
<BR>
the blind since the invention of Braille in the nineteenth century.
<BR>
Introduced in 1976, it reads ordinary printed materials such as books,
<BR>
magazines and memos to blind, visually impaired and dyslexic persons in a
<BR>
synthesized voice. Its invention required solving several important computer
<BR>
science problems and resulted in the creation of the first omni-font optical
<BR>
character recognition (OCR) technology, the first CCD (Charge Coupled
<BR>
Device) flat-bed scanner and the first text-to-speech synthesizer. Unlike
<BR>
limited-font OCR systems, Kurzweil’s OCR recognized print regardless of type
<BR>
style. It would be ten years before anyone else was able to duplicate this
<BR>
capability.
<BR>
<P>Each of these inventions evolved into what is today a major commercial field
<BR>
or industry, and the technologies that Kurzweil created, and their
<BR>
successors, continue to be market leaders within those industries. Virtually
<BR>
all American information workers use, at least indirectly, CCD flat-bed
<BR>
scanning and omni-font OCR, technologies first created and pioneered by
<BR>
Kurzweil. These are key enabling technologies that have made possible text
<BR>
and multi-media data bases, on-line information services, image and text
<BR>
documents on the World Wide Web and other manifestations of the information
<BR>
age.
<BR>
<P>When Kurzweil turned his attention to developing the first computer music
<BR>
keyboard that could accurately and convincingly recreate the sounds of the
<BR>
grand piano and other orchestral (i.e., acoustic) instruments, he applied
<BR>
the same lesson he had learned in developing the reading machine. All the
<BR>
engineers and scientists that worked on the new project were musicians, and
<BR>
many were quite accomplished. The Kurzweil 250, introduced in 1984, was able
<BR>
to fool concert pianists in an A-B “blind” comparison as to whether they
<BR>
were hearing a grand piano or the Kurzweil invention. The technology
<BR>
Kurzweil created allowed musicians for the first time to play the sounds of
<BR>
any acoustic instrument, to play them polyphonically (i.e., multiple notes
<BR>
at a time), and to apply the full range of computer control techniques such
<BR>
as sequencing, layering and sound modification to the rich desirable sounds
<BR>
of acoustic instruments. As with the Reading Machine and the OCR technology,
<BR>
it would be several years before any other person or organization would
<BR>
duplicate this feat..
<BR>
<P>The type of computer-based music synthesis that Kurzweil pioneered has
<BR>
evolved into what is today a multi-billion dollar industry and is used to
<BR>
create virtually all commercial music-recorded albums, movies, TV, etc. The
<BR>
Kurzweil brand of electronic musical instruments is a market leader and sold
<BR>
in 45 countries.
<BR>
<P>Kurzweil was also the principal developer of the first commercially marketed
<BR>
large vocabulary speech recognition technology. Kurzweil VOICE Report,
<BR>
introduced in 1987, could convert speech into print, the opposite of the
<BR>
reading machine. Today it is widely used by hands-disabled persons to create
<BR>
written documents, use computers, and control their environment. A
<BR>
combination of Kurzweil’s speech recognition technology with a
<BR>
Kurzweil-developed medical expert system and knowledge base is also widely
<BR>
used by physicians to create medical reports.
<BR>
<P>Overall, Kurzweil’s inventions have involved major advances in computer
<BR>
science, while at the same time yielding practical products that meet
<BR>
fundamental needs. It is rare for one individual to successfully work at
<BR>
both ends of this spectrum. He has also created multiple businesses to bring
<BR>
these inventions to market, all of which continue today as market leaders.
<BR>
His inventions have provided significant benefit to mankind by overcoming
<BR>
major barriers for disabled persons, enriching the world of music, and
<BR>
expanding the usefulness of computers for everyone.
<BR>
<P>In addition to his inventions, Kurzweil is a prolific author. His latest
<BR>
book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, When Computers Exceed Human
<BR>
Intelligence (Viking, 1999), has quickly achieved a high level of critical
<BR>
and commercial success.
<BR>
<P>Kurzweil received his BS in computer science and literature from MIT.
<BR>
<P>Background on the Other 1999 National Medal of Technology Laureates.
<BR>
<P>Robert Taylor, former head of the Xerox PARC Computer Science Lab,
<BR>
co-creator (with Alan Kay) of the Alto (the first personal computer), and
<BR>

<BR>
Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of ARPA, where he was instrumental in
<BR>
the creation of ARPAnet, the forerunner to the Internet.
<BR>
<P>The late Robert Swanson, founder of Genentech; regarded as the father of the
<BR>
biotechnology industry.
<BR>
<P>Glen Culler, UCSB (University of California at Santa Barbara) Professor,
