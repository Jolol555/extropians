<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Ah, but isn't being inconsistent a rather creative experience? &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no, creativity is a mixture of desire and discipline. Inconsistency may buy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you a reputation of being eccentric, but it won't make anything happen...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorry...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Then we are speaking about different things.  I make a distinctions
<BR>
between the creation of a novel idea, behavior, etc.; the expression of it;
<BR>
and the recognition regarding it.  The communication and recognition
<BR>
are entirely distinct from whether or not you &quot;created&quot; it, though
<BR>
they may be necessary for the creation to have an impact of some kind.
<BR>
<P>For me I look at most people and find them relatively predictable.
<BR>
This falls out of the fact that we have all learned behaviors that
<BR>
&quot;work&quot; and we are designed to stick to them.  You may be unconsiously
<BR>
&quot;inconsistent&quot; (usually we call those people crazy) or consciously
<BR>
inconsistent (in my mind creative).  Returning to Natasha's Art
<BR>
(hoping she doesn't mind this), would we consider her &quot;creative&quot;
<BR>
if all of her productions were recognizable variations on a similar
<BR>
theme?  I'm unsure whether the evolution of her art is due to
<BR>
desire and discipline or whether it is a more natural process
<BR>
(akin to &quot;growing&quot;).  When Chagall or Monet were developing the
<BR>
impressionistic style or Erte was doing Art Deco, it was creative,
<BR>
because it had never been done before.  Today we would look at artists
<BR>
doing similar work as technically adept but not particularly creative.
<BR>
<P>I would agree that desire and discipline may be useful in the communication
<BR>
and recognition aspects of expressing creativity, but I question whether they
<BR>
are required for &quot;creativity&quot; itself.  I think creativity may be nothing
<BR>
more than the ability to hold a large variety of concepts, withstand
<BR>
the &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; that may produce and then select from the
<BR>
soup things that happen to be novel in some way.  For me this part
<BR>
of creativty requires little desire or discipline.  I'm fascinated
<BR>
or entertained entirely by the beauty of an insight.  On the other
<BR>
hand writing ideas down, getting others to see their validity, etc. --
<BR>
that requires desire or discipline.
<BR>
<P>I would object strongly to the suggestion that the purpose of creativity
<BR>
is to &quot;make things happen&quot;.  Creativity occurs every time we string
<BR>
words together and may have no value other than our own entertainment.
<BR>
Finally, I would comment that individuals who are able to be intentionally
<BR>
inconsistent (rather than simply flakey), are probably quite creative
<BR>
since this tends to stir the soup and might result in the invention of
<BR>
something quite novel.
