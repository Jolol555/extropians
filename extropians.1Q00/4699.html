<EM>&gt;Pope Seeks Pardon for Catholics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;By CANDICE HUGHES
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;.c The Associated Press

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VATICAN CITY (March 12) - In an unprecedented moment in the history of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;church, Pope John Paul II asked God's forgiveness Sunday for the sins of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Roman Catholics through the ages, including wrongs inflicted on Jews,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women and minorities.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is 100% true.  It also should be noted that the person who said that
<BR>
the Antichrist is alive and a vegetarian (My, does *this* sound like an over
<BR>
the top Catholicism-bashing rumor) was not in fact the Pope, but rather
<BR>
reportedly the Archbishop of Bologna, Giacomo Biffi.  I have a very hard
<BR>
time believing that even if this were true, the pope would go for such a
<BR>
stance, since he 1) advocates pacifism (which the Antichrist is supposedly
<BR>
advocating) as well as 2) has been working towards an increased dialog with
<BR>
the Anglican church, another position supposedly condemned.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, we've heard this all before, folks.  I doubt the Christians on this
<BR>
list believe it any more than the non-Christians.
