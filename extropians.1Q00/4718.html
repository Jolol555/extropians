'What is your name?'  'GBurch1@aol.com.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that a rigorous determinist has to give up the notion of personal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moral responsibility.  If I were a classical determinist, I suppose I would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come to that conclusion - and promptly become an existentialist nihilist (a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusion to which much of Western culture came in the 20th century).  But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not, so I don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking as a classical determinist who hasn't embraced nihilism, I don't
<BR>
think that's a valid argument.  Determinism does not imply that moral
<BR>
responsibility is out the window.  It's easy to think so because the
<BR>
indeterminists have held the moral philosophical audience captive on sort
<BR>
of language I'm allowed to phrase my moral questions in, especially by
<BR>
defining what constitutes a moral choice, namely, a action made Freely, of
<BR>
your own Will, etc.  On that picture, if there's no Free Will, there are
<BR>
no choices.  How could there be moral responsibility, then,if there are no
<BR>
Choices?
<BR>
<P>Well, the answer, planly and simply, is that there are choices, just not
<BR>
Choices.  The fact that you were determined  to commit a wrong doesn't
<BR>
mean that you aren't morally liable for the choice you were determined to
<BR>
make.  (Where, on this view, a choice is simply an internal resolution to
<BR>
perform a given action, which is not considered free if it is performed in
<BR>
the face of human coercion.)  I can tell a number of different stories
<BR>
about why that might be: I might simply be deontologically required to
<BR>
perform action X while fated to perform action Y.  Alternately, others
<BR>
might be deontologically required to blame me for my action, regardless of
<BR>
whether or not I was fated to do it.  Similarly, performing action X might
<BR>
not be characteristic of a Good sort of person, making me morally liable
<BR>
whether or not I am fated to actually BE good.  Pretty much any
<BR>
foundational theory of ethics can be translated into this language while
<BR>
still preserving all of its force.
<BR>
<P>One fact you need to keep in mind is that this picture is easily
<BR>
misinterpreted as making moral censure epipheenomenal, of having no causal
<BR>
weight.  I might morally blame you, one might imagine, but you'd still be
<BR>
fated to perform whatever action you were going to perform.  But this
<BR>
argument is clearly false.  My choosing to blame you morally can and does
<BR>
have a causal effect  on your future behavior.  My choices, in turn, are
<BR>
determined by me, even if I'm determined by other forces as well.
<BR>
<P>The real distinction here is in our models of &quot;can&quot; and &quot;Causal.&quot;  On my
<BR>
picture, one *can* perform action X if there's a relevant possible world
<BR>
in which you perform action X.  Similarly, A causes B implies that, in all
<BR>
relevant possible worlds,if A doesn't happen, B doesn't happen either.  
<BR>
Determinism should not be taken to be asserting that there are no
<BR>
counterfactual possible worlds, but simply to be emphasiszing that such
<BR>
worlds are *coutnerfactual*, that the &quot;actual&quot; world is itself determined
<BR>
by the actual worlds which precede it.  This allows me to get around such
<BR>
objections as &quot;ought implies can&quot;, etc.  OF course ought implies can.  
<BR>
I'm just talking about a different can than the indeterminist is talking
<BR>
about.
<BR>
<P>Normally when I make a move like this, somebody makes some charge of
<BR>
redefining the terms to suit my ownarguments.  However, I'm not really
<BR>
sure what to make of this claim, except to say that I think the
<BR>
determinist has ALREADY done this, and that I'm simply reclaiming the
<BR>
terms for determinism, restoring &quot;can&quot; to something meaningful instead of
<BR>
&quot;is available to the Free WIll&quot;  In short, if you're dead set on one of
<BR>
the terms I need meaning something other than what I've taken them to
<BR>
mean, then you'll be dead set on determinism.  But in my mind that just
<BR>
means that the meanings of those terms are WITHIN the scope of debate,
<BR>
since they themselves are the subjects of contest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is what I meant.  But I've come to the tentative conclusion that it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not just an accident of our current state of knowledge that we have to use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperfect models and moral heuristics to guide our actions.  I think it's a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamental fact of life for complex minds: They can't model themselves or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other such minds completely (much less GROUPS of such minds), so there will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always be an irreducible core of activity that will be within what we now 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call the realm of moral philosophy and ethics.  Thus, as the complexity of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system to be treated as a potential moral object increases (relative to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moral SUBJECT'S ability to accurately emulate and model it), the more that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system MUST be treated as a moral object.
</EM><BR>
<P>I more or less agree with your tenative conclusion (wich emphasis on the
<BR>
*such* in reference to such minds -- I take it that a mind can come to
<BR>
predict vastly simpler minds than its own).  However, I disagree that the
<BR>
unpredicatbility of complex systems is what makes them moral agents.  I'd
<BR>
like to think that I'm a moral object even if there's some far away
<BR>
Jupiter brain right now that could, if it ever wanted to, predict my every
<BR>
move. I'd also be way of the idea that being a moral object is relative to
<BR>
the size of the brain of the person considering the questino.  Similarly,
<BR>
I'm nowhere near ready to predict the behavior of a chicken, yet I don't
<BR>
take chickens, cows, etc. to be moral objects/agents.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, there are other perfectly good reasons to treat someone like a
<BR>
moral object EVEN if you can predict their every choice.  You might have
<BR>
something to gain by doing so.  They'd probably have something to gain by
<BR>
your doing so.  That alone should suffice for treating someone like a
<BR>
moral object, whether you believe they are one or not, espiecially as it
<BR>
becomes easier to perform intelligence enhancement on other beings.
