<P>&lt;&lt; No, it is the list administrator's prerogative to reinstitute a once-
<BR>
&nbsp;before-instituted ban, should the rampant and wanton militia 
<BR>
&nbsp;memebotcy formerly bedrenching and deluging this list recurrently 
<BR>
&nbsp;infect and inflict it. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<BR>
The ban was mostly because YOU would not shut up.  Mike said hello!!!
<BR>
he has friends here, including me -  even if I do not like guns, I like Mike.
<BR>
You stepped in maliciously before he was even doen being welcomed back to the 
<BR>
list At least Mike has the decency to keep quiet - Listen - you are wearing 
<BR>
out your welcome REAL fast pardner.
<BR>
-REAL sick of this,
