<EM>&gt; &gt; There's also Brin's solution #3: &quot;Who watches the watchers? Everyone.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is a ridiculous statement, since we _already_ have that.  (If Brin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really said this, then he's lost some big points in my rating of him.:)  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can, in most countries, vote the current elite out of power and whoever we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elect can clean house at the various police departments.  However, this does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not happen.  Why?  Because each voter (Brin's &quot;everyone&quot;) has little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentive to investigate (&quot;watch the watchers&quot;) these matters or follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through with political (electoral or protest) or legal (filing lawsuits,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.) actions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I see the crux of the problem--you're assuming Brin means what
<BR>
the saying used to mean in Rome, and now.
<BR>
<P>No, Brin's not using the term metaphorically, the way it used to be
<BR>
meant. He means it in the ubiquitous unthwartable surveillance
<BR>
sense--should we permit that to come to be. One take on that is that
<BR>
it's now possible to project a government run by whoever is enough of a
<BR>
busybody to always be watching *something*... Is that so much worse than
<BR>
Big Brother? The gap you speak of might still exist there, it's true,
<BR>
but there's a *chance* to do something (including _move_) once your
<BR>
*really* know who the untrustworthy bastards are. With a camera over
<BR>
their shoulder *all* the time, because it's *expected*. Pretty far out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you've (and I'm using the &quot;you&quot; here in the plural sense -- not singling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out Lee Daniel here:) ever been involved in these matters, you would know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how difficult it is to proceed along these lines.  I've been involved in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few such actions.  They are very costly.  If you have to sit in court or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protest or campaign, it's very high cost.  Corrupt or bad police officers do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not face the same costs.  After all, going to court is usually part of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job and the court is often, sadly, on their side.
