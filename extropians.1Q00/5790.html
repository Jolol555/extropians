<EM>&gt; I snipped the following from the &quot;World Population Implosion&quot; article:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;In 1995, the ratio of population between &quot;less developed&quot; and &quot;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed&quot; regions stood at about four to one; in 2050, by these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projections, it would be seven to one. The balance of population would shift
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dramatically not only between given countries but even between entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continents. In 1995, for example, the estimated populations of Europe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (including Russia) and Africa (including Egypt and the Maghreb states) were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almost exactly equal. In 2050, by these projections, Africans would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outnumber Europeans by over three to one.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is totally ignoring the possibility that those areas may shift 
<BR>
into the 'more developed' category by that point in time, and it is 
<BR>
based entirely on current population trends, ignoring possible future
<BR>
shifts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I read an article sometime 18 to 24 months ago, online, it might have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.  I believe it was titled &quot;A Remarkable Time&quot;.  I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried a number of times to find it, after losing it a year or so ago.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predicted that population will grow to about 9 or 10 billion in the next 40
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fifty years.  Then it will slowly decrease.  What's next, after that, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pure speculation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After reading the article, my concern was no longer increase in population,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but rather where the increases are taking place.  If, in fact, our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population almost doubles before beginning to decline, 100% of that increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will take place in earth's least population friendly places.  There will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4 billion more newbies in the poorest parts of the world, the places that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't changed in millenia.  The &quot;have's&quot; will make up only a little over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10% of the population, and the 2040s' version of today's high school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; educated, store clerk, single parent, living in a slumlord's hovel, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medical insurance, will be one of the &quot;haves&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea that the most population unfreindly places could systain a 100% 
<BR>
increase in population is so ludicrous on its face it is obviously based
<BR>
on 
<BR>
false or icomplete premises.
