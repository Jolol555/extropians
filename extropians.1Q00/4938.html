<EM>&gt; &gt; HUMANITY FIRST!  We are capable of creating a technological/biological/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neurological utopia in the next century.  We already have the capability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; destroying all life.  What does it say of us as a species if we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the former?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I read the article (at work) monday night in Wired. I suppose the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose of the article was not to fall into techno-optimism/pomposity such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what happended with the &quot;nuclear age&quot;.   I bring that up since that example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was used heavilly in the Wired article, which featured Sun's founder; who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cautioned against such stumbles in genetics and nano.  Now we go back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asking; if we don't promote bio and nano, and Others do we will still suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the grey goo blues, without any green goo bennies, because we will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vacated a leadership position.
</EM><BR>
<P>What stumbles occured with nuclear power? Even counting Chernobyl (more
<BR>
a result of socialism than nuclear technology) and the two bombs dropped
<BR>
on Japan there are still fewer people killed by nuclear technology in
<BR>
its entire history than are killed every year by the pollution of coal
<BR>
burning technology, and coal burning plants put more radioactive
<BR>
materials into the environment every day than the entire US nuclear
<BR>
industry has released in its history. While some countries are shutting
<BR>
down their nuclear plants, they are increasing output at their coal
<BR>
plants, and are buring lower quality coal than ever before. China burns
<BR>
coal for most of its capacity that is so dirty that it would be criminal
<BR>
to burn here in the US.
