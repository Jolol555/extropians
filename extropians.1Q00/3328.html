<P>
Well, the 20+ hour trip to South Africa gave me time to read through
<BR>
the &quot;Case for Mars&quot; by Robert Zubrin.
<BR>
<P>Now, for those who are real hardheads, please watch the following:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I believe I was misguided, ill-informed, incorrect and perhaps
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even wrong in my previous position regarding support for a Moon-Base
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;over going to Mars&quot;.
<BR>
[There now, that only hurt a little...]
<BR>
<P>Zubrin has clearly done his homework and clearly makes a valid case for Mars
<BR>
being perhaps the first place we should go on a long term &quot;occupation&quot; basis.
<BR>
<P>However(!), he seems unaware of (or avoids) two key areas: AI and Nanotech.
<BR>
<P>He mentions nanotechnology once in the book, classifying it with other
<BR>
&quot;wishful&quot; technologies such as Faster-than-Light travel (Oooppps...).
<BR>
AI is also avoided, so it isn't clear whether or not he has thought
<BR>
very seriously about Moore's Law.  Since he discusses terraforming Mars
<BR>
over 100-1000 years, he doesn't seem to have much awareness of the
<BR>
singularity.  Biotech is mentioned only in passing.  Thats the bad news.
<BR>
<P>His treatment of rocket fuel synthesis, chemical engineering, and orbital
<BR>
dynamics are first rate however.  His philosophy is clearly libertarian
<BR>
and growth oriented but he seems to limit his concept of humanity to the
<BR>
standard issue human bodies.  Many of his economic arguments for colonizing
<BR>
Mars disappear if we even get minimal AI for human worker equivalence.
<BR>
He mentions using space based solar collectors as a key requirement for
<BR>
accelerating terraforming (but doesn't take it the next level that I do
<BR>
for using their exponetial growth to dissassemble the planet entirely.)
<BR>
<P>So, if Zubrin's perspective is typical of the average case for Mars individual,
<BR>
we have fertile ground for the Extropian philosophy, they just need to have
<BR>
their vision expanded a little.
<BR>
<P>Robert
