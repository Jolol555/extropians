What? &lt;re reading email several times...&gt; What?
<BR>
<P>1) Re: the leap from &quot;I just figure I don't have enough data to think
<BR>
further than the data&quot; to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like to be told what to think&quot;:
<BR>
This is mind-boggling to me. 
<BR>
Your words might be &quot;simpler&quot;, but I can't find the connection to mine.
<BR>
I don't know how you got there. 
<BR>
I cannot at present imagine a path of _reasoning_ which would lead
<BR>
there. 
<BR>
I therefore speculate that this was an emotional response on your part.
<BR>
I don't want to argue about whether this is so, I merely report it for
<BR>
whatever value it may have.
<BR>
<P>2) Re: the leap from &quot;I just figure I don't have enough data to think
<BR>
further than the data&quot; to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Any statement containing a (pre/pro)scription and
<BR>
&quot;we&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;they&quot;&gt;:
<BR>
This one is more understandable to me.
<BR>
I spoke as plainly as I could. 
<BR>
I said *I* twice, and I wasn't saying *you*, or *we*, or *they*. (As
<BR>
Daffy Duck said: &quot;a-HA! PROnoun trouble!&quot;) 
<BR>
I know how to say &quot;you don't have enough data&quot;, and I did not say that.
<BR>
I decline to say whether I think it. About theists, or atheists, or
<BR>
greencheesists (I actually like the last bunch), or any other ists,
<BR>
ismists or ismismatists.
<BR>
<P>If it sounds to you as if I'm telling someone what to think, I can only
<BR>
conclude that you're reading something in.
<BR>
IF my speculation in (1) is correct, that could explain it. I don't mean
<BR>
this speculation to be uncivil, by the way.
<BR>
<P>In conclusion: See my first paragraph in the original &quot;Judgment day&quot;
<BR>
post. I was reporting, I was not exhorting.
<BR>
<P>Someone other than myself is of course free to impute that I was/am
<BR>
duplicitous, or ignorant of my deepest motivations, or even some sort of
<BR>
*tool* of more doctrinaire people. Such a one is also free to insist,
<BR>
jackdaw-style, that everyone ought to know what that one knows. *Shrug*
<BR>
I don't usually operate strongly along the Myers-Briggs &quot;J&quot; axis.
<BR>
<P>But thanks for the feedback. I can use it.

<EM>&gt; So in simpler words you like to be told what to think?

<EM>&gt; Note: This is a question, not a statement, from my
