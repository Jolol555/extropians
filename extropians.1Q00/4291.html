Arthur C. Clarke's new book, _The Light of Other Days_, treats the same
<BR>
issue of a transparent society and then raises it to a higher level with a
<BR>
technological development that allows the public to view anyplace at
<BR>
anytime, thus making people accountable now for actions they thought they
<BR>
had successfully covered up in the past.  A new morality takes over the land
<BR>
(mostly).

<P>There was a short story in Analog (I think) about ten years ago, title
<BR>
something like &quot;Little Brother is Watching You&quot;, where the best antidote
<BR>
to government surveillance is citizen surveillance- it kinda predicted
<BR>
webcams.
<BR>
<P>Nuts, analogsf.com's back issue search engine doesn't show anything like
<BR>
the story I recall- oh, well, I'll just have to ask in alt.callahans-
<BR>
*somebody* there will have a copy of it, too.
