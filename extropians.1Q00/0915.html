<EM>&gt; My own feeling is that, while I wish there were a better way to get most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prescriptions filled, I seriously worry about what is happening with drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resistant bacteria.  Misuse of antibiotics seems to be giving rise to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing number of these resistant bacteria...and obtaining antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without a prescription and misusing them, will only make the problem worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (it's bad enough with antibiotic prescriptions obtained FROM physicians).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interestingly, the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic act cited in the article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; below was passed before antibiotics became available on a large scale basis.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe there is much interest in prescribing antibiotics
<BR>
through these online pharmacies.  They mostly traffic in vanity or
<BR>
&quot;discretionary&quot; drugs.  I ordered Xenical (which blocks fat absorption)
<BR>
from www.clickthrupharmacy.com and it was very easy, although more
<BR>
expensive than if I had gone to my regular doctor.  They also provide
<BR>
Viagra, Propecia (hair loss), Claritin (allergies), Renova (anti
<BR>
wrinkles).  I wouldn't want to have to go to the doctor and try to
<BR>
convince him to give me these drugs, because some doctors would view
<BR>
them as unnecessary.
<BR>
<P>But I doubt that many people are that interested in ordering illicit
<BR>
penicillin in this way.
