<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Wouldn't it be great if we could pass an international law that said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that nations had to fight their wars in simulators?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; While you're at it: how about a law that outlaws war?  How about all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; international disputes resolved by televised debate and online 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plebiscite?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; North Ireland's Catholic v. Protestant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Israel v. Palestine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Russia v. Chechnya
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all decided with the click of a mouse!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem with issues that lead to war is that they are typically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues where the parties both have truly justified but conflicting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interests, also where there is also an element where the situation has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;festered for so long that the original reasons are no longer the main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons, only hate. In such situations, any plebiscite will not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rational, and losers will not willingly accept being outvoted.
</EM><BR>
<P>No question there would be significant obstacles to creating such a system.  
<BR>
But all the societal suggestions I make on this list assume the existence of 
<BR>
strong AI and practical nanotech.  Given those developments, we could turn 
<BR>
all military power over to AI, to be used only when given the order by 
<BR>
society.  For instance:
<BR>
<P>Say Israel and Palestine cannot resolve a border dispute.  Each side would 
<BR>
be permitted to propose as many acceptable resolutions as it can.  Among 
<BR>
each side the alternative resolutions could be whittled down to just one per 
<BR>
side in preliminary plebiscites, sort of like the US Presidential primary 
<BR>
process.  Voting in the preliminary plebiscites would be limited to only 
<BR>
citizens of the involved body.  In international disputes, only citizens of 
<BR>
the disputant states would be allowed to vote in their state's &quot;primary.&quot;  
<BR>
Once the acceptable resolutions had been reduced to one per side, the matter 
<BR>
would be submitted to a general plebiscite at which every citizen in the 
<BR>
world would be invited to vote.  That way the losing side could not complain 
<BR>
of being defeated merely by the larger population of the opposing state.  In 
<BR>
order to win, a disputant would need to convince the world at large of the 
<BR>
superiority of its plan.
<BR>
<P>Once the general election is decided, coercing the disputants to comply with 
<BR>
the winning plan would be a simple matter of saying, either implement the 
<BR>
plan yourself or the global nano-powered AI police will implement the will 
<BR>
of the people, with your help or not.  Another global problem solved before 
<BR>
lunch.
