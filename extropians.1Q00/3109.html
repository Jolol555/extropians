<P>NEWFOUND QUASAR WINS TITLE &quot;MOST DISTANT IN THE UNIVERSE&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Guinness had a Book of Cosmic Records, a newly discovered 
<BR>
quasar in the constellation Cetus would make the front page.  
<BR>
This distant quasar easily skates past the previous record-
<BR>
holder, placing it among the earliest known structures ever to 
<BR>
form in the universe.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of astronomers identified the candidate after nights 
<BR>
of deep (long-exposure) imaging at the California Institute of 
<BR>
Technology's 5-meter (200-inch) Hale Telescope at Palomar 
<BR>
Observatory in California and at the National Science 
<BR>
Foundation's 4-meter (157-inch) Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak, 
<BR>
AZ.  A spectral analysis of the quasar's light was then completed 
<BR>
at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As soon as we saw the spectrum, we knew we had something 
<BR>
special,&quot; said Dr. Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion 
<BR>
Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, who played a key role in the discovery.  
<BR>
&quot;In images, quasars can look very much like stars, but a spectral 
<BR>
analysis of a quasar's light reveals its true character.  This 
<BR>
quasar told us that it was 'An Ancient' -- one of the universe's 
<BR>
first structures.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quasars are extremely luminous bodies that were more common 
<BR>
in the early universe.   Packed into a volume roughly equal to 
<BR>
our Solar System, a quasar emits an astonishing amount of energy 
<BR>
-- up to 10,000 times that of the whole Milky Way galaxy.  
<BR>
Scientists believe that quasars get their fuel from super-massive 
<BR>
black holes that eject enormous amounts of energy as they consume 
<BR>
surrounding matter.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quasar's &quot;redshift&quot; measures how fast the object is moving 
<BR>
away from us as the universe expands, and is a good indicator of 
<BR>
cosmic distances.  The faster it moves away, the more its light 
<BR>
shifts to the red part of the spectrum (toward longer 
<BR>
wavelengths), which means the faster an object appears to move, 
<BR>
the farther away it is.  At a redshift of 5.5, light traveling 
<BR>
from Stern's quasar has journeyed about 13 billion years to get 
<BR>
here.  That means the quasar existed at a time when the universe 
<BR>
was less than 8 percent of its current age.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The odds against us finding a quasar at a redshift of 5.5 
<BR>
were fairly large, especially when you consider how small a 
<BR>
portion of the sky we were observing -- 10 by 10 arcminutes.  To 
<BR>
get an idea of how small that is, try holding a dime at arms-
<BR>
length against the night sky; it's roughly the size of FDR's 
<BR>
ear,&quot; said Stern.  Until the last few years, no one had 
<BR>
discovered an object that came close to a redshift of 5.0.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-redshift quasars are vitally important to understanding 
<BR>
one of the biggest mysteries confronting scientists: how the 
<BR>
Universe went from the smooth uniformity of its youth to the 
<BR>
clumpy, galaxy-strewn formations we observe today.  Astronomers 
<BR>
believe that the young universe began in a hot, dense state 
<BR>
shortly after the Big Bang.  Matter in the universe was ionized 
<BR>
back then, meaning that electrons were not bound to protons.  As 
<BR>
the universe aged, matter cooled enough for electrons and protons 
<BR>
to combine, or to become neutral.  As the first stars and 
<BR>
galaxies formed, they reheated matter between galaxies, creating 
<BR>
the ionized intergalactic medium we see today in our local 
<BR>
universe.  The million-dollar question for today's cosmologists 
<BR>
is when this second transition from neutral to ionized gas 
<BR>
occurred.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing the spectrum of the new quasar will be very useful 
<BR>
for testing whether the universe was neutral or ionized at 
<BR>
redshift 5.5.  As a quasar's light makes its journey toward us, 
<BR>
the light is absorbed by any matter that lies in its path.  
<BR>
Scientists have learned that clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb 
<BR>
more than half of a quasar's light at high redshift (in the early 
<BR>
universe).  That finding is central to understanding when and how 
<BR>
super-massive black holes, quasars, and other structures 
<BR>
condensed from large, high-density clouds of hydrogen soon after 
<BR>
the Big Bang.  The new quasar will also shed light on how matter 
<BR>
was distributed at earlier stages of cosmic history.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Finding a quasar at this distance is like turning on a 
<BR>
flashlight at the edge of the universe,&quot; said Stern.  &quot;Because 
<BR>
quasars are more luminous than distant galaxies at the same 
<BR>
redshift, they act as the brightest flashlights, allowing us to 
<BR>
study everything that has ever developed between us and the 
<BR>
quasar.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent findings will be presented in an upcoming issue 
<BR>
of the Astrophysical Journal Letters.  The paper was written by 
<BR>
Daniel Stern and Peter Eisenhardt of JPL; Hyron Spinrad, Steve 
<BR>
Dawson, and Adam Stanford of the University of California; Andrew 
<BR>
Bunker of Cambridge University; and Richard Elston of the 
<BR>
University of Florida.  Images can be found at:
