<BR>
<EM>&gt; The book I cited is a summary of a 50M$ controlled experiment of 5000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people over 3-5 years where some where randomly given free health care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and others were instead given a small subsidy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robin, was this a government funded &quot;experiment&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those given free care incured ~30% more expenses, and yet had almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identical health.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, by that argument then, England should have a higher health
<BR>
care bill per capita than the U.S., yes?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the description you give, I would say this is a poor source to
</EM><BR>
use in debates regarding vaccines for the following reasons.
<BR>
First, I would presume that the study involved primarily adults
<BR>
who have already been vaccinated or built up a natural immunity
<BR>
to many diseases.  You aren't accounting for the &quot;sunk&quot; costs
<BR>
and benefits.  Second, vaccines aren't a particularly expensive form of
<BR>
health care so they aren't going to impact the costs very much.
<BR>
Third, most vaccines may have health &amp; longevity benefits that greatly
<BR>
exceed the period of a 3-5 year study.
<BR>
<P>If I get a dyptheria or polio vaccination that keeps me from catching
<BR>
the disease in 20-30 years (after I've been educated and am a productive
<BR>
member of society) the payback has to be pretty large.  Now that doesn't
<BR>
occur very often I'll admit.  The primary motivation for vaccinations
<BR>
is to prevent the loss of life in children that have received a
<BR>
substantial investment (monetary and emotional) from the parents.
<BR>
The studies Cairns cites seems to show population declines of 20-30%
<BR>
in the first 5 years of life.  So to properly look at the issue of
<BR>
vaccines you have to look at the &quot;costs&quot; of those deaths and the
<BR>
degree to which they are prevented by vaccinations (vis-a-vis some
<BR>
of the other death preventing developments we have discussed).
<BR>
Then you have to compare those benefits to the infrequent deaths that may
<BR>
be caused by vaccines and the actual costs of the vaccinations themselves.
<BR>
<P>If you are going to look at Medical costs, I think you have to look
<BR>
at treatments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not
<BR>
those treatments should be used.  I'm under the impression that this
<BR>
is what has been done in Oregon in determining what treatments are
<BR>
covered and what treatments are not covered.
<BR>
<P>Finally, regarding the issue of health care costs, its generally
<BR>
known that the elderly are the ones that are sucking up the $$$.
<BR>
Some huge fraction of our health care dollars (20-30%???) goes
<BR>
to support people in the last year of the lives.  I think I've
<BR>
mentioned to some people that this entire area needs to be rethought
<BR>
in light of things like Cryonics, because at some point its going
<BR>
to be cheaper for the government or insurance companies to pay
<BR>
to freeze someone rather than attempt to keep them alive.
