<P>
Perhaps the best strategy would be that that was recently announced
<BR>
where they fuse the patient's own dendritic cells with the tumor
<BR>
cells and reinject them into the body.  This causes the dendritic
<BR>
cells to display the mutated proteins from the cancer cells to the
<BR>
immune system and cause an amplification of the immune system cells
<BR>
that can react with and potentially kill the cancer cells.  This
<BR>
was being used, I believe, with kidney cancer and perhaps one
<BR>
other type, so it might take some convincing to talk the
<BR>
physicians involved to consider your case.  
<BR>
<P>While I keep hearing rumors about metastasis inhibitors, I'm unsure
<BR>
whether any have made it out of the lab stages into clinical trials.
<BR>
However, there *are* on the order ofi a dozen different angiogenesis
<BR>
inhibitors in clinical trials.  If you could get your sister into one
<BR>
of these you would have a 50:50 chance of getting a drug that could keep
<BR>
the tumors in the &quot;micro&quot; stages.  I am sure that some web searches
<BR>
and/or calls to the pharmaceutical companies would turn up who
<BR>
is running these trials.
<BR>
<P>The therapies listed above have properties that they are relatively
<BR>
&quot;non-toxic&quot;, in contrast to radio/chemo cancer treatments.
<BR>
<P>There are strong arguments for methods such as meditation
<BR>
or comic relief (anything that reduces stress, since stress
<BR>
turns down your immune system and that could allow the cancer
<BR>
to spread and grow more easily).  {See many refs by R. Sapolsky}
<BR>
I would not however recomend any &quot;faith&quot; methods because they
<BR>
would by their very nature &quot;disempower&quot; the individual and
<BR>
&quot;empower&quot; a force beyond their control.   I could imagine
<BR>
a scenario where belief in external powers, could cause
<BR>
sufficient stress reduction that the cancer could be
<BR>
dealt with by the natural defenses in the body, but to my
<BR>
way of thinking that is a very long shot and highly dependent
<BR>
on the psychology and belief system of the individual.
<BR>
<P>As a last resort, there is always cryonics.
<BR>
<P>If you cannot find any references or information on these,
<BR>
let me know and I'll try to dig deeper into my memory banks...
<BR>
