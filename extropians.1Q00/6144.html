<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but you'd have to know it was a spy plane, right?  I mean, you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just going to whip out your goose gun and take pot shots at any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;moderately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low-flying plane that buzzes over your property... right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Its my property, right? Since there is no law AGAINST shooting down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;model airplanes that trespass on ones property, then it must be open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;season..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even in the boondocks you have no right to destroy another person's property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; merely because you find it on your premises.  That's called conversion and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yes, its against the law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If your property trespesses on my property without your knowledge (i.e. if it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; livestock that has gotten out of its pen starts eating my garden), then I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still kill it IF it was causing damage to my property. Conversion only works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with livestock, because of the so-called animal cruelty issue, and only if its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not causing damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since a spyplane is being used to break my wall of privacy, and shooting it down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes no injury to another person, then its not conversion either, because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sent your property on my property with intent to cause me harm (i.e. disturb my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy). Entering another's property with intent is trespassing and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defendable with non-lethal force. Shooting down a RC spyplane is not lethal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force, even if you use a gun to do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha ha ha.
<BR>
<P>If some model plane is flying around your property, and it might go out of control
<BR>
and damage you, then it would be self-defense to remove that possibility.
<BR>
<P>If some model plane is flying around your property, and it's not yours, and you
<BR>
didn't agree to it, then its trespassing.  There is precedent that trespassing is
<BR>
grounds for self-defense.
<BR>
<P>If someone sets up a camera with zoom lens on the edge of your property, you should
<BR>
confront them about that and perhaps sue them.
<BR>
<P>I don't know airspace law but there is some altitude above the ground where it is
<BR>
public domain.  Maybe it is like 12 mile nautical coastline law, if someone could
<BR>
explain airspace that would be good.
<BR>
<P>If someone wants to access your records, they should be able to request it but not
<BR>
get it unless they had some otherwise legal prerogative.
<BR>
<P>Companies that use personal data should pay the people to use the data.  It could be
<BR>
ike the phone companies, some people pay five cents a minute, some people pay more,
<BR>
some pay less.  The companies can go to the people and pay them per use of their
<BR>
data, which means any time it is stored or accessed.  Heh heh, that would mean
<BR>
everybody in the United States gets a check from various places that use their
<BR>
personal, copyrighted data, if they agreed to let it be used.  Let the companies
<BR>
making money money off these individual's personal data work out plans and deals, as
<BR>
well as clearinghouse data managers and data representatives.
<BR>
<P>All policemen should carry audio and video recorders that are on, recording, and
<BR>
time-stamped at all times while on duty, but only as representatives of the armed
<BR>
public servant's senses.  Let them see how they like them before having anybody else
<BR>
have them.  Quantum storage will enable this soon.
<BR>
<P>The people should be able to get complete transcripts of the government before the
<BR>
government of the people.
<BR>
<P>This thread subject seems to imply that there are transhuman fascists.  Well, there
<BR>
aren't many libertarian fascists.
