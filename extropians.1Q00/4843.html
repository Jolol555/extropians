<P>
I get the impression there's some wonderment as to why I'm raising the issue.
<BR>
<P>While I understand that the ordinary way of doing things is to have
<BR>
arguments on every possible side of an issue, multiple organizations
<BR>
with conflicting goals - a situation that some may even associate with
<BR>
things like &quot;the free exchange of ideas&quot; - I thought I should take at
<BR>
least a shot at doing what a transhuman would do in this situation; get
<BR>
a complete consensus by everyone on the correct course of action.  I may
<BR>
not be a transhuman, but we're all supposedly rational people here, and
<BR>
it does seem to me that our choices here are not a matter of decision
<BR>
but of perception.  There is one unambiguous set of correct actions
<BR>
under all three major supergoals, and I want to at least take a shot at
<BR>
getting a consensus on that by all major Extropians and organizations.
<BR>
<P>In particular, my argument is that the probability of a Sysop Mind
<BR>
working is at least 30%, while the probability of uploading working for
<BR>
any given person in the absence of a Sysop, even given the technology,
<BR>
is no more than 0.1%.  den Otter and sayke have had a lot to say about
<BR>
this, about the glory of individuality and the evil of Big Brother and
<BR>
their reluctance to give up control, but none of it seems to address the
<BR>
basic fact that 30% is more than 0.1%.  If you open up box A, you have a
<BR>
30% chance of survival.  If you open up box B, you have a 0.1% of
<BR>
survival.  Those are the facts.  Everything else is just a side effect,
<BR>
a context-dependent heuristic.  Forget the instincts.  Forget the
<BR>
emotions.  Forget the social algorithms.  Think like an AI.  Which is
<BR>
more:  0.3 or 0.001?  That's it.  That's all.  Everything else is
<BR>
irrelevant.  You don't need to look inside those black boxes to see the
<BR>
answer.  You just need to know the numbers.
<BR>
