<P>&lt;&lt;  What about female labial rings and male ear or nipple
<BR>
&nbsp;rings? What agent of social repression imposed these practices?
<BR>
<P>Fashion. 
<BR>
You are mistaking cruelty, torture and slavery with bondage, scarring and 
<BR>
mutilation. 
<BR>
Those are beauty objects and sexual toys. Not the same thing at all.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Do you see that the accepted historical vogue of interpreting these
<BR>
&nbsp;phenomena in &quot;political&quot; terms may represent a complete misunder-
<BR>
&nbsp;standing, and not even be exactly wrong? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>You are making a fundamental mistake in interpretaion. It is not vogueish to 
<BR>
reject these memes. 
<BR>
<P>Religious atrocities, silly fashion, and dumb cultural memes are rarely  
<BR>
&quot;political&quot; in inception, even if later they may get picked up by them and 
<BR>
further  &quot;imposed&quot; on society to achieve a more specific end. Example: the 
<BR>
religious right has made a big case out of homophobic reactions, and used 
<BR>
that meme to achieve POLITICAL goals - however that meme grew out of a more 
<BR>
basic fear.) This is clearly distrucive to us, yet many follow. 
<BR>
<P>The memes almost never (in the beginning) &quot;benefit&quot; one person, or even on 
<BR>
strata of society. There is no darwinistic simplicity since it is a polluted 
<BR>
pond. Things grow up and rise out of that bubbly murk, because it &quot;catches&quot; 
<BR>
on.
<BR>
<P>It only takes one politician who can see the trend and harness it, like 
<BR>
Hitler did in the depression, to achieve &quot;political&quot; ends.
