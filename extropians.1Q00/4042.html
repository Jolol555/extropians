<EM>&gt; &gt; To be more precise, such a science might predict your beliefs at any stage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of a cognitive process; I see no reason to focus on some mythical &quot;end.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And let's not get distracted by the straw-person of perfect prediction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It could be plenty useful if predictions were just much better than random.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Don't forget what's supposed to make your argument work.  In your orginal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case, you hypothesized a scientific crystal ball which would predict ALL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of my ethical beliefs. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I was just responding to your challenge at that time.  You had said that even
<BR>
with an empirical magic wand, one couldn't say anything about right and wrong.
<BR>
I agree that such a wand makes the strongest case; I disagree that without it
<BR>
there is no case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The fact that I'm going to believe X *normally* doesn't provide any argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at all for believing X now, but the fact that I'll believe X at the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inquiry *does* provide me with reason to believe X.  ... your scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;process ... argument ... it's a dismal failure if it fails at all, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*nothing* like the argument from the best answer applies his cloudier crystal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ball.  ... [the same claim is made several more times in other words]
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this is just wrong.  The difference between your beliefs now and at
<BR>
the &quot;end&quot; of inquiry is made up of a bunch of little differences between
<BR>
nearby points in time.  Anything that informs you about your beliefs at any
<BR>
future time implicitly informs you about your beliefs at the &quot;end&quot;.  I could
<BR>
prove this in a Bayesian framework if you would find that informative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In fact, you can't give me *any* such argument without getting your hands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dirty and doing some non-empirical moral philosophy, and *that's* what I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trying to show: you can't do the whole thing empirically, you have to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least some of the job non-empirically.  ... No experiment can reach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these criteria, and any experiment that fails to reach these criteria won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell me anything about ethics by itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's consider a physics analogy.  You tell me that you have placed an atom
<BR>
at a very particular location in your brain, and you challenge me to use
<BR>
science to tell you the exact mass of that atom.  I reply that sure, physics
<BR>
is useful here.  I can right off tell you the mass is almost surely limited
<BR>
to being one of the known isotopes of known atoms.  Furthermore I might do a
<BR>
(non-destructive) brain scan and determine the kinds of atoms that are
<BR>
contained in your brain, which are presumably not all possible atom isotopes.
<BR>
You then reply that is not good enough.  You want the mass of the particular
<BR>
atom you have in mind, and no you aren't going to tell me which one that is.
<BR>
You then conclude that, ha ha, physics isn't enough to tell the &quot;whole thing&quot;
<BR>
about the mass of atoms, &quot;you have to do at least some of the job
<BR>
non-empirically,&quot; and so the mass of atoms &quot;isn't PURELY empirical&quot;.
<BR>
A true claim, I suppose, but very weak, and it wouldn't justify your saying
<BR>
that physics should stop going around saying that science can tell us the
<BR>
mass of atoms.
<BR>
<P>The analogy should be obvious: Your exact moral beliefs at any point in
<BR>
time will be determined by your brain state, some of which will be
<BR>
unobservable by the rest of us.  That doesn't mean that we can't learn
<BR>
most everything there is to know about morals by learning how brains
<BR>
evolve their moral beliefs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; ...  You complained that evolutionary psychology folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were pretending to study ethics, while instead ethics is just a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; world; no factual statements are relevant to judging ethical statements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Point of interest: that's a gross oversimplification.  I'm simply making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the standard can't-derive-ought-from-is argument.  ... I do hold that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;empirical matters *alone* won't tell me anything about ethics.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm disputing that standard claim, and am saying that empirical matters
<BR>
alone tell us a lot about ethics, and as the science progresses may well
<BR>
tell us almost everything there is to know about ethics.
