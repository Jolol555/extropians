<P><P>Speaking as an athiest (but one who is pro-choice and anti-death penalty),
<BR>
I'd say that assuming a link between theism and a stance on abortion is
<BR>
to make a fundamentally misguided assumption. Moral reasoning and belief
<BR>
in a Big God Person Watching Over Us(TM) would appear to be orthogonal,
<BR>
if not independent; while an appeal to religious belief is often used to
<BR>
justify moral assertions, the absence of religious belief doesn't imply
<BR>
the absence of a moral stance (and the presence of religious belief
<BR>
doesn't guarantee one either, as the history of the Inquisition should
<BR>
make clear).
<BR>
<P>If I had to concoct an argument against abortion starting from an atheist
<BR>
viewpoint, I'd make a big point about the uniqueness of individual
<BR>
intelligence. I have to take the assumption that _my_ existence has
<BR>
merit as a starting point. If I also adopt the assumption of mediocrity,
<BR>
then I am not privileged or unusual in having a meritorious existence. It
<BR>
follows that all me-equivalent entities -- human beings -- are important.
<BR>
If we pursue this line of reasoning to a logical conclusion, it implies
<BR>
that no human beings are unimportant: therefore destroying human beings
<BR>
is ....
<BR>
<P>(Personally I don't like this sort of logical argument. It's too divorced
<BR>
from actual experience to be relevent; besides, it assumes that I am worth
<BR>
exactly as much as an anencephalic foetus, a Josef Stalin, and a Kurt Godel.
<BR>
While ascribing different values to any of these individuals is a rather
<BR>
complex operation and prone to argument, settling for the &quot;all humans
<BR>
are equal&quot; assertion is, I think, an even greater error -- especially
<BR>
in an age of cheap tissue cloning and imminent uploading. I am inclined
<BR>
to think that coming up with a moral framework for evaluating the importance
<BR>
of intelligence is going to be one of the most trying philosophical and
<BR>
ethical problems of the next century. Does your word processor have rights?
<BR>
Your pet African Grey parrot? Well, what about a complex medical expert
<BR>
system? A robot driven by a 10 Gnode neural network? A chunk of cloned,
<BR>
differentiated human cerebral cortex sitting in a vat, copied from
<BR>
an original DNA template called &quot;Slobodan Milosevic&quot;?)
