<P>
To anyone interested in really devoting lots of time to tactics and projects
<BR>
discussed in this thread, I recommend a book &quot;rules for radicals&quot;, by Saul
<BR>
Alinsky. It's old, published in the 1970s I believe. I read it a long, long
<BR>
time ago.. I was about 15 so it's not difficult reading. It's mainly an
<BR>
instruction manual for effective ways to stir up trouble. He describes it
<BR>
himself as the antithesis to Machievelli's (sp?) The Prince. Mr. Alinsky was
<BR>
a labour organizer primarily, I believe. What stands out in my mind most is
<BR>
the creative and fun ways he would stage various civil rights and labour
<BR>
protests. The book is entertaining if nothing else. I remember, even then,
<BR>
disagreeing with much of the author's ideology, but being stunned by his
<BR>
skill and effectiveness.
