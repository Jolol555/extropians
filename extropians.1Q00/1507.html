<EM>&gt; As an example of possible benefits, I have heard it postulated that viruses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may provide a mechanism for the injection of novel DNA into otherwise stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mammalian genomes, and that action if true, may contribute to longer term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species viability, but I have never heard whether this was confirmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experimentally proved untrue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Most of the junk DNA in the organisms of higher organisms is littered
<BR>
with sequences derived from retrotransposons.  These are mobile genetic
<BR>
elements, highly related to viruses that suffle your DNA.  The standard
<BR>
textbook, &quot;The Cell&quot;, describes viruses as &quot;mobile genetic elements&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It would probably be an error to consider mammalian genome's &quot;stable&quot;.
<BR>
One of the reasons for the rise of mammals may have been the development
<BR>
of more rapidly varying genomes, perhaps through retrotransposons
<BR>
(I've never seen retrotransposons discussed in reptiles -- yeast,
<BR>
Drosophila and mammals are typically cited.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now for the REASON for the question...most research on viruses focus on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideopatic/pathologically negative to humans action of viruses. What if there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are massively useful but extraordinarily subtle benefits that viruses convey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to humans about which we are totally ignorant. Is there any research on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this? If no one is looking here, my intuition is that it would yield
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredible fruit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Shuffling the genome has both benefits and harms.  Shuffling your MHC
<BR>
genes makes you better able to resist the really harmful viruses
<BR>
(by making more variant immune systems).  Shuffling other parts of
<BR>
the genome causes birth defects, cancer (esp. leukemia), etc.
<BR>
<P>I think the subtle benefits are likely to go hand-in-hand with
<BR>
the less than subtle harms.  Probably because its easier to
<BR>
break something that works than it is to improve on something
<BR>
that is already &quot;improbably&quot; functional, the harms exceed the
<BR>
benefits.
