<EM>&gt;Well, yes, but out of millions of animal species, humans are the only one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who have any problem with kids copying each other's term papers, or driving fast through red lights in busy traffic
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this is an equivalent issue.   Extended and emergent forms
<BR>
of social organization require corresponding extensions of control
<BR>
mechanisms.  Matching the shift in system structures, the regulatory
<BR>
schemes become increasingly distributed, symbolic, and exobiological.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  or new husbands killing the former husband's babies - is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entirely the consequence of *warped* social norms? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Makes perfect evolutionary sense in some cases, as others have mentioned.
<BR>
(And also a different topic).  When the units of evolution were
<BR>
individual animals, the wiping out of competitive entities happened
<BR>
on the physical level.   In a modern human society, this practice
<BR>
lost its utility and only has destabilizing effects, so no wonder
<BR>
it has been suppressed.  The direct analogs of this practice on
<BR>
the socio-economic level where the evolution is concentrated at
<BR>
this point, seem more abundant than ever.  In both social and
<BR>
economic formations the new power structures routinely eliminate
<BR>
undertakings started by their predecessors.  This is a widely
<BR>
accepted practice, and there are lots of social regulatory schemes
<BR>
that make sure that such cases go smoothly and efficiently.
<BR>
<P>What I was talking about, was normal relations between individuals
<BR>
that didn't have any problems in animal species, and have problems
<BR>
in the society now only because of the warped dynamics of processes
<BR>
in the human memetic swamp.  
<BR>
<P>People still have the same sexual interests as animals but they 
<BR>
cornered themselves into the state where their behavior is unfree,
<BR>
and concepts are hypocritical, and this does not resolve either
<BR>
traditional or emergent issues.   Moreover, the sincere social
<BR>
discussion of what is being resolved, is socially acceptable,
<BR>
and all struggle goes in various groups of people suppressing 
<BR>
and hurting each other just because they can't discuss the issues
<BR>
they very well know exist. (Clinton firing Elders for mentions
<BR>
of masturbation, prohibitions of public nudity (breast-feeding
<BR>
in public is illegal in many U.S. states) &quot;fornication&quot;,
<BR>
sodomy and polygamy, plus all inconveniences on the personal
<BR>
level where people spend huge amount of time and thought to make
<BR>
their bodies look more attractive through the clothes, but would
<BR>
never show the body itself or even talk about it).
<BR>
<P>I thought of conducting an experiment on rats, where they would
<BR>
have to wear some clothes, with only feet and face visible,
<BR>
and if any rat appears without such covering, it, and others that
<BR>
see it, would be punished.   Then see whether poor rats would have
<BR>
sexual and emotional problems around nudity the way humans do.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there are many reasons for it in the human society.
<BR>
Religion is often aggressively puritanical, prohibiting authentic
<BR>
emotional expression it cannot monopolize; industry wants to
<BR>
sell clothes;  old people who make the rules feel threatened by
<BR>
the beauty of the young that they cannot match; unionized sex
<BR>
(marriage institution) protects its stability from disruption,
<BR>
and after people haven't seen each other naked for generations,
<BR>
they already really can't handle it, and have to perpetuate the
<BR>
restrictions.
<BR>
<P>Most of sex-related restrictions and persecutions do not resolve either
<BR>
old biological, or new social issues, but rather create new problems,
<BR>
making people into unhappy hypocrites burdened by guilts and desires
<BR>
they are scared to express.   These restrictions are social diseases,
<BR>
harming liberty as much as their analogs (from organized religion to
<BR>
false advertising to tabloids) undermine reason.
<BR>
<P>Practically all people have internalized these random violations of
<BR>
both reason and liberty to the extent that they feel enraged when
<BR>
someone tries to debate these restrictions rationally - or when they
<BR>
suspect that someone in private is breaking them.
<BR>
<P>The struggle between these people and a minority of experimenters
<BR>
may be more important for our future than any technological issues.
