<P><EM>&gt; I headed off the issue of &quot;playing god&quot;. I said, (paraphrasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself as it's been a while) &quot;Some people would accuse me of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'playing god' but I disagree. To play god, I would have to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy into existence from nothing and form that into matter. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to wait a few billion years for that to become life. I'd have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to wait a few more billion years for that life to become human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings.  Frankly, I don't have time to 'Play God', I'd rather just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use what's already here.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Beautiful! You sound like a very good debater. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most were xians issuing the usual canned platitudes. One I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decried the fact (they're opinion only) that there seemed to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total lack of morality on either side of the aisle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, this is where we could improve our memetic artillery. Many
<BR>
people want to hear moral arguments for or against doing something,
<BR>
and we should be able to give them. As long as the concept of morality
<BR>
usually falls into the purvey of conservatives, the debate will be
<BR>
biased. Somebody says: &quot;but what about ethics?!&quot;, there is an
<BR>
embarrassed silence as most people cannot come up with anything to say
<BR>
since they do not know how to make good ethical arguments, and then a
<BR>
conservative (of any color - red, blue, green, brown, whatever) rushes
<BR>
the stage, spruting his or her standard line, filling the silnce. But
<BR>
if we ourselves argue for the ethics of our actions, then we can
<BR>
acually use this interest in ethics to make people more open to it.
