<P><EM>&gt; All evidence so far points at that - just look at the gun thread, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  libertarianism thread or the &quot;is an upload of me really me?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tread. Although with a good enough infrastructure previous information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  *might* be able to force the threads into new directions. Maybe we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will get trans-flamewars at that point :-)

I am guessing the reason for the eternal loop is principally two issues. One 
<BR>
is human ego, and the glorious power struggles inherent in them. The Second 
<BR>
issue is the 'lack' of practical information regarding this. Lets face it, 
<BR>
for whatever reason, the most prodigious minds of our time are not very 
<BR>
interested in Identity hypothesis and uploading.  The uploading technology 
<BR>
may indeed be centuries away rather then decades as many here hope, and if 
<BR>
the brainiacs of our epoch find that quest un-appealing because of its 
<BR>
remoteness, they will not spend their careers at conferences or getting 
<BR>
papers published.
