<P>Have you tried to use an e-mail perusing program which sorts the list output
<BR>
into ``threads'' using the ``In-Reply-To:'' headers placed in the e-mail by
<BR>
most modern e-mail writing program? (Some mail readers use the ``Subject:''
<BR>
header for this, but this method may generate a bogus ``thread'' where, in
<BR>
reality, there exists none.)
<BR>
<P>With this &quot;technology&quot; one can detect a discussion, who take part in it, who
<BR>
commented on what, etc., and, if the software supports it, can ``kill'' a
<BR>
thread altogether.  I find this functionality highly useful for my purposes,
<BR>
especially if I can ``unkill'' that thread or author later.
<BR>
<P>If a discussion enters the flame zone, then one simply ``kills'' the thread,
<BR>
and never see anything more of ut, unless, of course, the jihaders become
<BR>
rude enough to overflow the entire list with their ``discussion'', in which
<BR>
case the ``kill file'' may seem an appropriate measure for the bad humans.
<BR>
<P>If one avoids the &quot;Plonk!&quot; type message when ``killing'' an e-mail author,
<BR>
then one will also avoid the response(s) it almost certainly would generate.
<BR>
<P>If one's mail perusing software does not support ``In-Reply-To:'' threading,
<BR>
then one should, IMO, replace the software with a more functional one.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kpj
