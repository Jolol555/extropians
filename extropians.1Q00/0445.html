<EM>&gt; &gt; These people worry me;  they are an alliance of extreme nationalist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  groups who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  seem to be coordinating with each other, even when their views clash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Racist groups of various racial backgrounds seem to be working together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  despite their mutual distaste for each other.  They are assimilating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Green memes to coordinate with the anti-GM crowd.  They have found a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  common enemy--us &amp; all we stand for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amazing and horrifying.  Despite being a fairly close student of politics and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society, I'd never heard of this group or its ideology, but they fulfill 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EXACTLY the design of my worst nightmare: A populist-aimed blend of racism, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religion and &quot;naturism&quot;.  Their hit counters and the feel of their rhetoric 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicates that they are a very marginal group, but their explicit aim of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coalition building is exactly the sort of thing that children of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Enlightenment need to be watchful of.  Thanks for this link . . . you've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ruined my whole day :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't worry too much about these guys, if they ever manage
<BR>
to form some sort of coalition it won't last for very long; they 
<BR>
just hate eachother too much. No, as Eugene pointed out, we
<BR>
should worry about those things that are the most likely to 
<BR>
kill us, and that's the very technologies that will be needed
<BR>
for our ascension. Our worst enemy isn't some radical religious
<BR>
or political group, but naive technophilia.
