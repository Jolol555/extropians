There is probably no way for me to prove conclusively that Jesus existed
<BR>
in historical fact, and that was not what I was attempting to do.  I
<BR>
offered the New Testament as evidence, since it purports to be an account
<BR>
of the life and teachings of Jesus, much as a document might be
<BR>
introduced into evidence in a court case.  I suppose any historical
<BR>
document is open to question.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, but most of the books of the New Testament were letters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; written by Paul, who never met Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, Paul converted to Christianity a couple of years after Christ 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; killed, after he had been dispatched to Damascus to put down a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; community which he subsequently joined, but it might be fair to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he was a contemporary of Jesus, was closely associated with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the earliest Christians, and was able to recount the life and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teachings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of Jesus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You claimed that most of the books of the New Testament were written 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apostles who personally knew Christ.  Paul is not an eyewitness to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He cannot recount the life and teaching of Jesus.  He can only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repeat what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he has been told, as do modern believers today.  Paul cannot give 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence for the existence of Jesus.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi (religious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teacher),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to see some evidence of this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I can't provide a specific quotation from a Jewish authority, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not surprising to me that he could be called a Rabbi, since he was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Jew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who instructed Jews on religious matters, and had many followers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is pretty much the definition of a Rabbi.  A controversial Rabbi, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are using the Christian bible as evidence again.  There are no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sources that list Jesus Christ as a recognized Rabbi.  You are not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any Jewish historical evidence for Jesus.  You are repeating what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Bible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; says again.  You are citing the bible as evidence for itself.  This 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independent historical evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many prophets who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; before&gt; Mohammed,&gt; &gt; the Seal of the Prophets (the last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prophet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mohammed was born around 570AD, and died around 632AD.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; attributed to him occurred after that date, over 600 years after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even though Mohammed lived centuries after Jesus, it would not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preclude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Jesus being recognized by Muslims as a prophet.  The holy building 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Kabaa, which looks like a black cube, located in the center of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; religious compound at Mecca, was built by Abraham (according to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legend),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so that suggests that Islam reveres Abraham, who long pre-dates 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jesus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and who is part of the Jewish tradition.  The Muslims call Jews 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Christians 'People of the Book', meaning that Jews and Christians 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the holy scriptures which pre-date the Koran, and Muslims allow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Jews and Christians worship the one true God.  That suggests that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Muslims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; respect the scriptures of the Christians and the Jews, just as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; respect at least some of the scriptures of the Jews.  I don't have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the Koran, much less one with an index, so I can't easily look 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whether any mention Jesus actually appears in the Koran.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You make my point for me.  The Muslims respect the scriptures of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christians.  They quote the New Testament passages as saying Jesus 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, you cite quotations of the New Testament as evidence for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jesus.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Muslims do not have independent historical evidence for Jesus 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All three of your examples boil down to quoting the New Testament 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; references
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Jesus.  You have not presented any historical evidence outside of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian scripture itself.  We all are aware of the Christian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scripture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question is whether there is any historical evidence outside of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian claim that Jesus actually existed.
