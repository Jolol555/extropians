<EM>&gt; Chinese Doctors Claim Cancer-Treatment Breakthrough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese surgeons are declaring a breakthrough in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cancer treatment after turning a patient's malignant tumor into a ball
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of ice, state media said on Saturday.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cryotherapy has been around for quite some time.  It is very commonly
<BR>
used on warts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doctors at Xijing Hospital in the northwestern city of Xian inserted a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superconductive knife, 0.0788 inches in diameter, into the tumor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liver cancer patient, Xinhua news agency said.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, lets see, &quot;superconductive&quot;.  That implies a aluminium germanium
<BR>
niobium knife with a temperature of ~21K (-252C) or a High Temperature
<BR>
superconductor [e.g. Bi2CaCu2O8Sr2 @ 120K (-153C)].  The question is
<BR>
*why* do you need a superconductor???  Once you get through the skin
<BR>
the body is a fairly good conductor (salt water conducts electricty
<BR>
due to the ionic charges).  They don't say anything about &quot;electrocuting&quot;
<BR>
the tumor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By forcing high-pressure argon and helium gas through the knife point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they were able to lower the temperature of the tumor to minus 220.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, argon has a freezing point of -189C and helium has a boiling
<BR>
point of -270C.  So they are forcing argon &quot;ice&quot; and helium &quot;gas&quot;
<BR>
into the knife point ???  Now maybe they can fudge this by changing
<BR>
the pressures involved, but I'm not sure of the point of this approach.
<BR>
Why not use much cheaper LN2 or LO2 as a coolant???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``In 60 seconds, the tumor became an ice ball,'' the article said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adding ``all cancer cells were killed.''
</EM><BR>
<P>No matter what you use, if you deliver a coolant that cold to a
<BR>
localized tissue area and remove the heat the body is producing
<BR>
you *will* produce a ball of ice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``The operation took only 30 minutes. The patient felt no pain and there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was no bleeding,'' it said.
</EM><BR>
<P>There very few pain receptors inside the body and there will
<BR>
not be any blood loss if you freeze or cauterize the tissue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``The therapy is a breakthrough in cancer treatment,'' it quoted Dou
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kefeng, a surgeon in charge of the operation, as saying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd have to go through the literature, but I think this has been
<BR>
done before.  All they may have developed is a reasonably good
<BR>
localized delivery method and even that is suspect because the
<BR>
facts seem to add up.
<BR>
