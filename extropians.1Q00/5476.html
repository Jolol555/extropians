<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The test actually works AGAINST the agent-firing hypothesis, as in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the FLIR recreation, people are visible next to all the fired weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; whereas in the original FLIR, no contiguous people are visible.  Guns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; do not kill people unless other people are firing them, and such people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; being visible in EVERY instance of the &quot;recreational&quot; gunfire, but in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; NO instance of the original glints, the test results do not bode well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the contentions of the Branch Davidians' attorney that such glints
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; represent gunfire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Another reason why the people may show up in this footage and not in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the original footage is that the ambient temperature and ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; temperature on the day of the original incident were very close to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; body temperature, while the recreation film was shot at temperatures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 69 degrees, a 30 degree difference. Additionally, there was not a fire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going in the recreation to dampen the sensitivity of the FLIR at low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; temperatures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael is right on the money for this one.  Humans and other animals will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quickly disappear into the ground clutter as the ambient temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approaches their normal body temperature, particularly if they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stationary.  The practical effect is that the effective resolution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human objects drops as the ambient temperature increases.  In other words,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while it is easy to resolve a person a quarter 400m away when the ambient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature is 60F, you have to be practically on top of a person to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolve them when the temperature is 90F.  In my own experience (using IR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a search mode), IR is almost useless on warm summer days because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to get so close that you can see what you are looking for without the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IR.  It works great at night, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gunfire on the other hand, is always much hotter than ambient.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; All of these factors, as well as the use of dyes and starches in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clothing could be contributing factors in why the people's bodies showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up in the recreation, but not the original incident.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think this is a factor, since FLIR is a passive technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I understand it, the fabrics/dyes used in BDUs are non-reflective in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IR spectrum so that you don't stand out when painted with an IR beam
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (e.g. from near spectrum devices like night vision).  You can't effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shield a person against far infrared e.g. FLIR.  For hunters, there is a UV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue with some detergeants and brighteners, since certain animals can see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the UV spectrum.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my own experience in Panama during the invasion to get Noriega, and as SOP
</EM><BR>
for other deployments and exercises, we weren't allowed to starch our BDUs or
<BR>
use common consumer detergents. I've seen first hand what starch in BDUs does to
<BR>
its 'non-reflective' capabilities when viewed through tactical Night Vision
<BR>
Goggles, I would imagine its the same effect with FLIR. Makes you light up like
<BR>
a street light.
