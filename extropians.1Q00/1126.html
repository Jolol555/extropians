<EM>&gt; &gt; It is unfortunately not rare to find people so insecure in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own observation and judgment that they would question their own most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cherished beliefs simply because 2 billion people happen to disagree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is also unfortunate that people can't be brutally, scrupulously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; honest about their beliefs without being seen as &quot;rude&quot;.  Dishonesty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; causes far more problems in the world than rudeness ever did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is my sincere, honest, carefully considered, firmly held belief
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that Christian dogma is complete hogwash.  To say anything less would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be an insult to my audience and to philosophy as a whole.  To take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offense at such an honest expression is a fault of the listener, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the speaker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am in full agreement with you on this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too. Religious superstitions have nothing useful to 
<BR>
offer us. On the contrary; they often actually prevent (or
<BR>
rather: delay) positive changes to the human condition. 
<BR>
This alone makes them morally repulsive -- not to mention 
<BR>
the fact that many gods are childish, sadistic bastards. 
<BR>
We should be very glad that they don't really exist.
<BR>
To quote Robert G. Ingersoll:
<BR>
<P>&quot;When I became convinced that the universe is natural, that 
<BR>
all the ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my 
<BR>
brain, into my soul, into every drop of my blood the sense, 
<BR>
the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled 
<BR>
and fell. The dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts 
<BR>
and bars and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, 
<BR>
a serf, or a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide 
<BR>
world, not even in infinite space. I was free--free to think, to 
<BR>
express my thoughts--free to live my own ideal, free to live 
<BR>
for myself and those I loved, free to use all my faculties, all 
<BR>
my senses, free to spread imagination's wings, free to investigate, 
<BR>
to guess and dream and hope, free to judge and determine for 
<BR>
myself...I was free! I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously faced 
<BR>
all worlds.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Ah, to bask in the warm light of reason...
