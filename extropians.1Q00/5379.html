I wasn't arguing with the role of libraries, actually - just
<BR>
with the efficiency of centralized innovation.  The Library
<BR>
of Congress as well as local libraries may be useful - though
<BR>
there are good chanced that they could be provided by private
<BR>
charity and commercially; and in any case, isolated islands of
<BR>
comparative efficiency do not prove much - though they are
<BR>
often called to &quot;prove&quot; that the generally inefficient
<BR>
monolithic structure is useful, and justify its intrusion
<BR>
into areas where their influence is inefficient at best...
<BR>
<P>I'd say that all human social instincts are limited to their
<BR>
immediate contact environment.  Though these feelings have been
<BR>
frequently, with historically refined methods, summoned to support
<BR>
much larger structures, usually to delegate control to a 
<BR>
centralized authority that would to exercise power by/for/over
<BR>
&quot;people like you&quot; (who actually aren't), the gut feeling of
<BR>
our instincts still calls us to care about the benefits of
<BR>
our families and co-workers.  The the celebrated grand-scale
<BR>
structures, fighting this gut feeling with ideology, manage
<BR>
to instill &quot;official pride&quot; in the populace, but still
<BR>
generate wide-spread mistrust in the same people.
<BR>
<P>Of course, as beings that benefit from cooperation with others
<BR>
we need to have social connections - but the connections
<BR>
don't have to be centralized.   Ecosystems, cultures and
<BR>
economies alike, are produced largely by cooperation, and
<BR>
in many cases are built directly on local needs, though they
<BR>
in most cases work best when governed locally - just where
<BR>
the social interests are...  Communist ideology was recognizing
<BR>
the necessity of shifting social and personal instincts and values
<BR>
to the national level for the efficiency of centralized control
<BR>
mechanisms, but it wasn't good enough at either.
<BR>
And did they try...
