<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330004440.63548.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.  It doesn't take much computational ability to &quot;detect wrongdoing.&quot;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; look at my screen - I see you slit a child's throat - I compute: &quot;Hey 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; looks like wrongdoing.&quot;  And I call the cops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a hell of a lot of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>*Which screen* you look at depends on *what* you're looking for.  If I want 
<BR>
to find out what *you* did today, I command &quot;play Fabulich video 03-29-2000, 
<BR>
6:00 to 18:00 PST&quot; and your boring day plays out on my monitor for 9 hours, 
<BR>
or until I get bored and press &quot;stop.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Allow me to fill in a few blanks.  I'm making some assumptions here which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you may not be aware of.  Your argument is a lot like an argument raised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by David Brin.  You've probably at least heard of him if you've looked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around for information on &quot;transparent socity.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm almost finished with his book now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;His argument requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that at some point or other, hidden cameras get very cheap and very easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to move around.  This, he argues, will usher in a transparent society, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which it's impossible avoid being monitored whenever somebody feels like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.  He then provides some argument as to why this would be a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, I'll assume for the sake of argument that Brin is right that hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras will get extremely cheap and extremely easy to move around.  (He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isn't; it's much harder to transmit and receive information like that than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he realizes.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That remains to be seen.  You have to keep in mind that this sort of 
<BR>
transparency will probably not be possible until there are significant 
<BR>
advances in computation, AI and/or nanotech.  Once that happens all bets are 
<BR>
off as to what is hard and what isn't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So no one, not even a despot, could prevent you from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;observing his every move.  One would *still* need to analyze the data, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;figure out which screen to look at.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, which &quot;screen&quot; you look *at* depends on what you are looking *for*.  
<BR>
Think of the web as a huge database (which in effect it is).  Right now 
<BR>
there are millions and millions of pages on the web.  But you don't need to 
<BR>
do any big time &quot;data analysis&quot; to use the web.  Why?  You go to your 
<BR>
handy-dandy search engine, type in what you are looking for and viola! a 
<BR>
nice neat little list of choices pops up for you to choose from.  I can't 
<BR>
believe this is such a hard concept to grasp.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, you propose that there should be some servers, probably running a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;strong AI&quot; which do that analysis, which look at all the screens at once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and detect wrongdoing.  People will not be doing this for themselves, we'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imagine, but would have some server do it.  Obviously, individuals would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not own their own servers, (otherwise, they'd be doing it themselves,)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so the government would have to provide some public servers to tell the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public when and where they need to watch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps you already see where this is going.  If the government owns those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;servers, then the government could just as easily switch them off, or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more likely, deny anyone who isn't a member of the elite access to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The people can't prevent this, because they don't own the servers, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because they were depending on those servers to know where to look to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to call the cops.  Without access to the servers, they have all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information they need buried until terabytes of information they don't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And we're back in the position I'd argued we'd be in the first place: a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;significant divide in terms of the amount of processing power available,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and therefore a vastly increased utility for those with power relative to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Go back to the web analogy.  The government doesn't control the search 
<BR>
engines now.  There is no reason that the &quot;government&quot; would have to control 
<BR>
the transparency servers I talk about.  Sure there could be government 
<BR>
servers, but those would not be the *only* ones.  Given the importance of 
<BR>
the integrity of the data in such a society, redundancy would be the word of 
<BR>
the day.  Probably the best solution would call for an oversight body 
<BR>
containing both government officials and civilians, like police review 
<BR>
boards.  Reliable checks and balances systems are not all that difficult to 
<BR>
implement.  After all here in the US we've been doing them for over 200 
<BR>
years now.
<BR>
<P>But, once again, regardless of who was in control of the servers, as long as 
<BR>
the system was sufficiently transparent it would not matter.  All that is 
<BR>
needed is that the transparency of the process can be assured (and 
<BR>
verified).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In summary.  This system is very useless without a lot of data-crunching,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because otherwise, you don't know where to look.  The more data-crunching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can do, the more useful your system is to me.  The more powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I am, the more data-crunching I can do.  So the more powerful I am, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more useful your system is to me.  So this system helps the powerful more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than it helps the weak.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep the Internet analogy in mind.  *Tons* of data, almost no data 
<BR>
crunching.  What you want is what you get, when you want it.  Why would you 
<BR>
think our ability to sort, organize, store and retrieve data will get 
<BR>
*worse* in the future than it is now?
<BR>
