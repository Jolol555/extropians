<P>I can't argue with the &quot;complexity&quot; -- I suppose this is why its never
<BR>
been well-defined.  I think Kierkegaard, the first existentialist, grasped
<BR>
it when he spoke of &quot;contradiction&quot; and inspired the existentialist theme
<BR>
of &quot;the Absurd&quot;, e.g. Sartre and Ionesco's &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Tertullian said: &quot;Credo quia absurdum est.&quot; Why is his famous &quot;credo&quot;
<BR>
infamous? Because it evokes cognitive dissonance, the judgment that
<BR>
it too is absurd, and (in those with a sense of humor) provokes some
<BR>
expression of amusement. Of course he is making an oblique reference
<BR>
to the premier mode of demolishing an argument -- &quot;reductio ad
<BR>
absurdum&quot; -- this is an archiac response of rationality to cognitive
<BR>
dissonance. And that's the point: humor presupposes rationality,
<BR>
which is embedded in the sardonic and satiric as well as the whimsical
<BR>
and zany. So, returning to Aristotle, &quot;homo sapiens&quot; IS &quot;homo risibilis&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Your argument, madam, is a joke.&quot;  Just kidding, just kidding.
