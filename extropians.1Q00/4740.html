<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; -when you're talking about parallel conciousness do you mean like multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lodes of conciousness stemming from a single, original mentality. Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the multiple conciousness will be of different personalities or sexuality or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever.

<P>When I'm conscious of my consciousness (i.e. able to grok myself;
<BR>
acheiving a relative experience of enlightenment, etc.) I can
<BR>
observe myself.   The problem is that my thought seems single-threaded,
<BR>
i.e. consciousness appears to only run on a single processor
<BR>
(even though I know there is a hugh amount of stuff going on
<BR>
underneath that that the attention machine is selecting from).
<BR>
However, on this nice dual-cpu system that I normally work on,
<BR>
I can watch the task manager profiling the system and see those
<BR>
cases where both processors swing into action.  I can envision the
<BR>
possibility of a state where, as you point out, I might have
<BR>
two complete personalities with different genders running on
<BR>
separate processesors and in a &quot;zen&quot; state, watch both of
<BR>
them operating at the same time.  Now its going to get confusing
<BR>
because they have to decide which one gets to control the body.
<BR>
But in an uploaded state I can augment the inputs and outputs
<BR>
and so have dual (or more) experiences simultaneously.
<BR>
<P>I can imagine learning how to manage this will be quite interesting.
<BR>
There may be a model for this already in people with split
<BR>
personalities.  I believe that in some individuals that some
<BR>
of the personalities can observe the others in operation but
<BR>
can't intervene.  In other cases the actions of the personalities
<BR>
are hidden from one another.  Its interesting in thinking about
<BR>
this, that it seems to imply our brains normally have enough processing
<BR>
capacity to handle multiple personalities but most people generally
<BR>
don't have them.
