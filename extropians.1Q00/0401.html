<EM>&gt; &gt; Other memes or thoughts that I have in the past tried to

<EM>&gt; What's wrong with technological determinism?
</EM><BR>
<P>I used the term to denote the idea that certain technological
<BR>
developments will happen - they are a historical necessity (&quot;It
<BR>
railroads when it is railroad time...&quot;). Greg pointed out the link to
<BR>
marxist history, but the whole concept can be found just about
<BR>
everywhere in the political spectrum. 
<BR>
<P>The problem with technological determinism is simply that it is wrong
<BR>
- it is an oversimplified view of history, ignoring the complex
<BR>
interplay between technology and society, economics, individuals,
<BR>
serependipity and other influences. Certainly there are feedback loops
<BR>
that drive certain technologies (think Moore's law and how much people
<BR>
are expecting it to be true) but technology is not an independent
<BR>
force from everything else. 
<BR>
<P>Now, if you are a Marxist and technological determinist you might end
<BR>
up making silly statements that the overthrow of capitalism is
<BR>
inevitable because the means of production *will* change in a certain
<BR>
way which *will* have a certain sociological impact. It is simple to
<BR>
translate that into transhumanist terms: &quot;The exponential increase in
<BR>
computing power *will* lead to the emergence of AI which then *will*
<BR>
become superhuman and that in turn *will* lead to the
<BR>
Singularity&quot;. Each &quot;*will*&quot; is really a non sequitor or more or less
<BR>
poorly supported assumption, ignoring all the rest of the world. 
<BR>
<P>I'm really glad I was forced to take a small course in the history of
<BR>
technology as an undergraduate. It cured me of my naive technological
<BR>
determinism by showing how complex the evolution of technology really
<BR>
is. On the other hand, I was surprised how little the historians cared
<BR>
by the future history of technology or how to apply what they had
<BR>
learned in the forward direction. Here is an empty academic ecological
<BR>
niche for someone brave enough to sieze it...
