<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;The government&quot; have gotten about as far as

<EM>&gt;&gt; Venter, arguably further, as PE Corp has a bunch of fragments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; which they _may_ assemble first, no one knows.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; a) the government project has been at it for ten years.
</EM><BR>
10 year sin which the sequencing machines which now run at high speed were
<BR>
developed. That argument is like &quot;proving&quot; Apple is dumb because 10 years
<BR>
they had machines running at 32 MHz and today Venter has a supercomputer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;ago Venter started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two or three years ago and has already sequenced the fly genome, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shares about an 80%+ commonality with the human genome
</EM><BR>
The 80% commonality is:
<BR>
a) not known (no one knows what the true overlap is until the single
<BR>
nucleotide resolution genome is known)
<BR>
b) irrelevant. As Venter himself acknowledges coyly, he is happy to give
<BR>
away the 99% overlapping part of our genome, as long as he can keep patent
<BR>
rights to the critical 1% or even .1% of differences that make a difference.
<BR>
No one cares (well I do, but most people don't) about the enormous repeat
<BR>
crap about how to build basic building blocks of life.
<BR>
<P>The valuable part is the part that codes for your IQ of 140 versus Jane's IQ
<BR>
of 100.
<BR>
the part that codes for your schizoprhenia vulnerability versus Jill's
<BR>
invulnerability.
<BR>
<P>These are miniscule when counted as base pairs. So base-pairs are a useless
<BR>
metric for genomic value.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and will finish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human genome one or two years before the government project, and at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a cost that is a small fraction of what the government has spent. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say thats beating the pants off of them.
</EM><BR>
That is because he
<BR>
a) is taking the government work as  a base.
<BR>
b) is not doing a whole genome nucleotide sequence
<BR>
<P>Depends what your goal is. At any rate, it is clear that all progress is
<BR>
selectively made at the end of period, not in the middle. We are now towards
<BR>
the final third of the genome-sequencing-machine-speed sequence. It is
<BR>
rising exponentially, so a new start up (say you and me and two rich
<BR>
friends) could catch up to Venter in a few months. Does that make us beat
<BR>
the pants of Craig?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Point B: In my humble opinion Venter is being granted ownership  to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; information which is not for sale. I own it already. And so do you. I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; selling. Therefore I do not want the government (who is trying via their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; patent officers) to steal my ownership rights and give them to Craig Venter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The human genome is something that I do agree all human beings share an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equal ownership in. The government apparently has no intention to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Venter any patent rights at all,
</EM><BR>
He already HAS patent rights.
<BR>
He has THOUSANDS of patents pending.
<BR>
So too do several other companies, some of which are being even smarter
<BR>
about grabbing single nucleotide differences that matter by selectively
<BR>
sampling the expressed (as opposed to unexpressed) genome on a dynamic
<BR>
(correlated with the phenotypic expression) basis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and is pretty pissed that he's making them look like idiots.
</EM><BR>
I think he is the idiot, but that is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Considering that any government information that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't classified for defense purposes is required to be made available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to everyone freely, the government is breaking its own law by refusing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide Venter (who is one of us) with any of their own results.
</EM><BR>
Completely wrong. We already have access to all of the &quot;government&quot; (HGP)
<BR>
results. What Venter wanted was exclusive access. In other words, the exact
<BR>
opposite of what you had taken him to mean. He is very economical not to say
<BR>
Clintonesque, with his use of words.
<BR>
<P>Pay attention to the exact phrases because your honest and open mind hears
<BR>
what I hear (the reasonable interpretation) while he is speaking a highly
<BR>
limited legal meaning.
<BR>
Think 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman&quot;
<BR>
compare
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I will share the vast majority, even 95% of the sequence information&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only that, but they are trying to get Venter to share his results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without any sort of propreitary use agreement. When he balked at this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they got all huffy and started making him look like the bad guy.
</EM><BR>
I don't think &quot;they&quot; much care what Venter does. they are going to give away
<BR>
the genome project regardless. Plus, the vastly more important collaborative
<BR>
SNP project is contractually in the public domain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So far as I know, all Venter is interested in doing with the genome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information is to package it and sell it to other researchers.
</EM><BR>
What does &quot;package mean&quot; It is already packaged. You just download it.
<BR>
<P>He is interested in patenting the functional sequences.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he added value to the information by actually sequencing it
</EM><BR>
The information is the sequence. I don't understand you here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value and investment he has a right to a return on.
</EM><BR>
Along with all the other people who care to sequence it later on. That tis
<BR>
like saying the first person to map a territory has a right to force all
<BR>
subsequent land-owners to use and pay for his survey, rather than making
<BR>
there own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He has no problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with other companies doing their own sequencing and selling that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
False. he wants exclusive patent ownership of the sequence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What he has a problem with is other companies getting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free his results that the government wants him to provide to them. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far as I am concerned, he is totally justified.
</EM><BR>
He can keep his data secret as far as I am concerned. What I care about is
<BR>
that he wants to stop me from sequencing the genome too.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; He is not patenting innovative medicine, or proteomic interventions, or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; _functional_ variants on the genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he isnt trying to patent anything that I have heard.
</EM><BR>
Then you have not been listening. I can give you some online refs if you
<BR>
want, but a simple internet search of his radio and TV interviews is easily
<BR>
grabbed for yourself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Instead, he has filed patents on thousands of _fragments_ of code. Raw code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since when?
</EM><BR>
Basically as the data come in they stream it to the patent office. I am not
<BR>
sure if they are only patenting sequences which are associated with a
<BR>
function or if the patents pending are simply of the sequence per-se`.
<BR>
Someone who knows can say please ....?
<BR>
<P>tim
<BR>
<P>&quot;I think one characteristic I have always had is that I knew whether I knew
<BR>
something or did not, whether I understood something or did not understand
<BR>
it. And I wasn't always happy if I didn't understand something.&quot;
