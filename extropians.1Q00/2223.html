Doug Jones, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:random@qnet.com?Subject=Re:%20WWW%20representation%20of%20Real%20World?%20(I%20hope%20not)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002070335.TAA15025@finney.org&gt;">random@qnet.com</A>&gt;, writes, responding to the idea of
<BR>
pseudonymous postings:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But then I would sacrifice the credibility I've built up over the years.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that new, pseudonymous posters on technical newsgroups often:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) are engaging in hatchet jobs (I was targeted by one of these a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    months ago, but my reputation carried the day)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) have no history, by definition- and face the problem of the classic &quot;man
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in the chair&quot; ads in Aviation Week (&quot;I don't know you, I don't know your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    company, I don't know your product, I don't know your customers- now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    what did you want to sell me?&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My reputation is valuable to me, but in order to build up a reputation, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be (surprise surprise) reputable.  Anonymous posters must fight an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uphill battle for this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Years ago there was a technology proposed which was designed to handle
<BR>
this kind of problem.  Based on cryptographic techniques invented (and
<BR>
patented) by David Chaum, you could have a set of pseudonyms, which would
<BR>
be used in different situations and for different purposes.
<BR>
<P>The idea was that you would get a &quot;credential&quot;, which is like a
<BR>
cryptographic certificate or signature, associated with your pseudonym.
<BR>
This would be a certification by the issuer that your nym had some
<BR>
specific property.  It might be a statement that you were a good credit
<BR>
risk, or that you'd returned all your library books, or that you're
<BR>
technically knowledgeable in field X.
<BR>
<P>The unique aspect of Chaum's system was that he had a mathematical trick
<BR>
by which a credential issued on one of your nyms could be transferred to
<BR>
any of your other nyms, in a &quot;blind&quot; manner so that the nyms wouldn't be
<BR>
linked.  You could get your &quot;good credit risk&quot; credential from a bank and
<BR>
show it at a store, without your bank nym being linked to your store nym.
<BR>
<P>Chaum elaborated his system with mathematical extensions that allowed
<BR>
credentials to be combined in various ways, or to handle numeric
<BR>
inequalities, so you could show you were over 21 without revealing your
<BR>
actual age, for example.  He even had some ways to deal with negative
<BR>
credentials, so you could not hide the fact that you had received a
<BR>
negative credential on one of your nyms, even when using another.
<BR>
<P>In practice though the system would have some difficulties, for example
<BR>
people might share nyms in ways that the system does not intend to allow.
<BR>
So far no one seems to have made any effort to put this kind of credential
<BR>
system into use.
<BR>
