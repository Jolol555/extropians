</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following?':
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This is false.  Transparency is not enough.  You need transparency, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;capacity to recognize wrongdoing, and the capacity to do something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; None of these requirements seems like much of a hurdle in a transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If a despot is in power and you know it, getting the capacity to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something about it is quite a hurdle indeed.
</EM><BR>
<P>You *keep* assuming that a despot will or can take power in a constitutional 
<BR>
democratic transparent society.  This simply does *not* make sense to me.  
<BR>
It has *never* been done.  You have posited *no* argument which makes me 
<BR>
believe that it ever will or could be done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;LOTS of data-crunching, you just forget it's going on.  Can you imagine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;system like this if it depended on human agents to type in what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;cameras were seeing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The point is that its not going on by *my* machine.  The crunching is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; done on the server.  My box just reads the results to me, no big deal.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; result I don't need to invest in a big powerful server to benefit from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; data on the web.  Government, with all its fancy shmancy hardware can't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anything on the web I can't do.  This undercuts your &quot;the big guys will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; better use of it so they can crush you&quot; argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Look, my whole argument is that you can't guarantee yourself access to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;server, even if you can assure yourself access to the cameras. Remember,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these servers are government owned and government run.  The government can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take away the servers, and THEN where would you be?
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you are assuming that the servers would be government owned and run.  I 
<BR>
never suggested this.  I don't even know that the sytem would need to depend 
<BR>
on any central &quot;servers.&quot;  Even if some sort of central server were 
<BR>
required, it would seem to make much more sense to me if the servers were 
<BR>
distributed, robust and redundant without any one hierarchical controlling 
<BR>
body.  Think Usenet.
<BR>
<P>And even if it was necessary to have some sort of central oversight 
<BR>
committee (which I doubt) there is no reason why it would have to consist 
<BR>
solely of government employees.
<BR>
<P>And, further, assuming that (1) it is necessary to have a centralized server 
<BR>
system and (2) it is necessary to have a single hierarchical controlling 
<BR>
body and (3) it is necessary that the hierarchical controlling body be made 
<BR>
up exclusively of government employees, again as long as the body and its 
<BR>
personnel and its decisions and its actions were sufficiently transparent, 
<BR>
it would not matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;For the curious, you do it like this:  You seize control of a small 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;area,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  (Whoops!  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;cameras aren't lie detectors, are they?)  You seize control of some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;territory, and lie, claiming that you intend to seize no more.  Repeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Granted, I left out the hard part, which is actually seizing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;territory, but the principle is tried and true.  And unfortunately, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;cameras can't detect intentions any better than the modern press.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Except that the act of &quot;seizing&quot; *any* territory in the US makes you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; criminal and the feds will swiftly give you an extra large helping of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Montana Freeman - Branch Davidian treatment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In a democracy, you might run it differently.  Instead of seizing control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of &quot;territories,&quot; as such, you start picking off minorities.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legal in a democracy, and while it might be looked at askance, no one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to run over and attack you simply because your state has done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something offensive to a minority.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you ever *heard* of the US?  Have you ever been there?  I don't know 
<BR>
what you have read about democracy, but you obviously have never seen ours 
<BR>
in action.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The most vivid example we have of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;despot rising to power where there was once a democracy was Hitler.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you wanted to be a despot in America, you'd do it the way he did it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well much as that might make for an interesting thought experiment, I'm not 
<BR>
going to pursue it further.  I don't see any despot rising to power in the 
<BR>
US or in *any* similarly constitutional democracy.  Keep singing that same 
<BR>
song if you want, fact of the matter is it ain't gonna happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; OK now look at it this way, for all the reasons you just said it would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; difficult to overthrow a despot if he had access to ubiquitous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   For all those same reasons, it would be just as hard (if not harder) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the despot to take over in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not if the despot manages to get a mandate from the people first.  Hitler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'll recall, had the popular vote.  How would a transparent society have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevented Hitler from rising to power?
</EM><BR>
<P>A constitutional democracy like that in the US (transparent or not) would 
<BR>
have prevented Hitler from rising to power.  Because it is simply 
<BR>
unconstitutional to become a despot in the US.  The only way to do it is to 
<BR>
(1) *drastically* amend, or throw out the constitution or (2) militarily 
<BR>
take over.  One *last* time, that is *NOT* going to happen.
