<P>UMass Scientists Reports Nanotech Advance
<BR>
Findings to be detailed in the journal Nature 
<BR>
AMHERST, Mass. -- A UMass polymer scientist is among the researchers 
<BR>
reporting a major step forward in nanoscopic pattern transfer in the Feb. 24 
<BR>
issue of the journal Nature. Tom Russell, polymer science and engineering, 
<BR>
and postdoctoral researcher Thomas Thurn-Albrecht collaborated with Ullrich 
<BR>
Steiner and graduate student Erik Schaffer of University of Groningen, The 
<BR>
Netherlands. The findings have implications in paving the way for 
<BR>
still-smaller integrated circuits, magnetic storage in computers, and on-chip 
<BR>
sensors; all of this without the use of chemicals. 
<BR>
<P>Scientists aim to produce devices so small that they can only be seen with 
<BR>
electron or atomic-force microscopes. Russell specializes in polymers -- 
<BR>
long, linked strands of molecules that can be custom-designed to offer 
<BR>
properties ranging from the softness of silk to the hardness of rubber. The 
<BR>
National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy fund his work 
<BR>
in this area. 
<BR>
<P>Schaffer and Thurn-Albrecht began by placing a thin film of polystyrene -- 
<BR>
the same material from which disposable coffee cups are manufactured -- atop 
<BR>
an electrode. A second electrode was placed above the film, leaving an air 
<BR>
gap between the film and the top electrode. The polystyrene was then heated, 
<BR>
liquefying it, and a small voltage was placed on the electrodes. With time, 
<BR>
the surface of the film appeared pockmarked. What essentially occurred, 
<BR>
Russell explained, is that the electric field amplified waves on the liquid's 
<BR>
surface. The waves were increasingly amplified and eventually were pulled to 
<BR>
the top electrode. The phenomenon shows up under the microscope as a dark 
<BR>
ring on a light background. As time passed, more and more circles appeared. 
<BR>
Strikingly, they were all the same size, and appeared at a precise distance 
<BR>
from one another. 
<BR>
<P>The phenomenon occurs, Russell says, because of the interaction of four 
<BR>
competing forces. Those forces include: the electrical force, which pulls the 
<BR>
liquid toward the top electrode; the surface energy of the liquid, which 
<BR>
wants the liquid to lie flat; the viscosity of the liquid as crests and 
<BR>
valleys form and the liquid moves; and the effects of atmospheric pressure. 
<BR>
&quot;It doesn't happen helter-skelter,&quot; explains Russell. &quot;It happened at very 
<BR>
distinct distances that represents a delicate balance between all of these 
<BR>
forces.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps more importantly, the team can also &quot;imprint&quot; a film with a very 
<BR>
specific design -- a process called pattern transfer. In pattern transfer, an 
<BR>
electrode is etched with a master pattern. The master electrode has a 
<BR>
topography of &quot;hills&quot; and &quot;valleys.&quot; When a voltage is applied, the film 
<BR>
responds most strongly to the closest portions of the electrode, creating a 
<BR>
replica of the master's design on the polymer film.
