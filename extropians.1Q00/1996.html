<P>
My quick observation is that unless someone very intelligent develops mind 
<BR>
downloads and/or syntho bodies humanity will still need to take in air. Hence 
<BR>
the need for shipping anthropoid bodies (current humans) to space colonies of 
<BR>
some type over the 1-5 centuries to beat the clock on Volcano Winter.

<P>Supervolcanoes could trigger global freeze 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Heat rises from under Yellowstone Park
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><P><P>By environment correspondent Alex Kirby 
<BR>
The threat of climate change caused by human activity could turn out to be a 
<BR>
minor problem by comparison with a scarcely acknowledged natural hazard. 
<BR>
<P>Geologists say there is a real risk that sooner or later a supervolcano will 
<BR>
erupt with devastating force, sending temperatures plunging on a hemispheric 
<BR>
or even global scale. 
<BR>
<P>A report by the BBC Two programme Horizon on one supervolcano, at Yellowstone 
<BR>
national park in the US, says it is overdue for an eruption. 
<BR>
<P>Yellowstone has gone off roughly once every 600,000 years. Its last eruption 
<BR>
was 640,000 years ago. 
<BR>
<P>Professor Bill McGuire, of the Benfield Greig Hazard Research Centre at 
<BR>
University College, London, told BBC News Online: &quot;We're getting ready for 
<BR>
another eruption, unless the system has blown itself out. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;But the ground surface deformation and other signs measured by satellite 
<BR>
suggest it's still active, and on the move.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Molten rock
<BR>
<P>Typically, supervolcanoes are not mountains but depressions, huge collapsed 
<BR>
craters called calderas, which are hard to detect. 
<BR>
<P>The Yellowstone caldera is 70 kilometres long and 30 km wide. Eight km 
<BR>
beneath the Earth's surface lies a huge magma chamber, containing vast 
<BR>
amounts of molten rock. 
<BR>
<P>As pressure rises in the chamber, the surface is also rising and there is a 
<BR>
measurable increase in heat. But vulcanologists do not know when Yellowstone 
<BR>
will blow. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Supervolcanoes are related to giant calderas 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Professor McGuire, whose book, Apocalypse! A natural history of global 
<BR>
disasters, portrays a possible Yellowstone explosion in 2074, says there have 
<BR>
been two such events every 100,000 years for the last two million years. 
<BR>
The areas where supervolcanoes are most likely to be found, he says, are 
<BR>
subduction zones, where the Earth's plates are dipping below one another. The 
<BR>
Pacific Rim and southeast Asia are especially vulnerable. 
<BR>
<P>But there is a caldera in the Phlegraean Fields near Naples in southern 
<BR>
Italy. Dr Ted Nield, of the Geological Society of London, told BBC News 
<BR>
Online: &quot;It could do the same as Yellowstone, though on a smaller scale&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Nuclear winter
<BR>
<P>&quot;When a supervolcano goes off, it is an order of magnitude greater than a 
<BR>
normal eruption. It produces energy equivalent to an impact with a comet or 
<BR>
an asteroid. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;You can try diverting an asteroid. But there is nothing at all you can do 
<BR>
about a supervolcano. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The eruption throws cubic kilometres of rock, ash, dust, sulphur dioxide and 
<BR>
so on into the upper atmosphere, where they reflect incoming solar radiation, 
<BR>
forcing down temperatures on the Earth's surface. It's just like a nuclear 
<BR>
winter. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Animals not caught in the eruption would face major climate change 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>&quot;The effects could last four or five years, with crops failing and the whole 
<BR>
ecosystem breaking down. And it is going to happen again some day.&quot; 
<BR>
Ice-core records show that the eruption of Toba in Sumatra about 74,000 years 
<BR>
ago may have caused global cooling of from three to five degrees Celsius, and 
<BR>
perhaps as much as 10 degC during growing seasons in middle to high 
<BR>
latitudes. 
<BR>
<P>Even ordinary volcanoes can affect the climate. When another Indonesian 
<BR>
volcano, Tambora, erupted in 1815, several years of globally cold weather 
<BR>
followed, with the annual global mean surface temperature about one degree 
<BR>
Celsius below normal. 
<BR>
<P>The Geological Society, in evidence to the UK Parliament, is urging more 
<BR>
research into the risk from supervolcanoes and their probable climatic 
<BR>
effects. 
<BR>
<P>Horizon is on BBC Two at 2130 GMT on Thursday, 3 February.
