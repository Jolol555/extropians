<EM>&gt; &gt; You are automatically assuming that the original works of the artist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were a clear perspective. Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Chislenko what he thinks...
</EM><BR>
<P>As my mail agent copied this message into the &quot;Chislenko_cited&quot; folder,
<BR>
I'd talk a bit around this recommended-to-be-asked question.
<BR>
<P>I did not have the privilege of hanging out with British aristo-communist
<BR>
intellectuals or the famous classics of original communist theory
<BR>
and practice - and neither do I claim the extensiveness of their
<BR>
theoretical background for that time or their philosophical and
<BR>
literary talents.   However I do have some advantages over them -
<BR>
of the same kind that a modern professional astronomer has over
<BR>
most brilliant medieval star-gazers in understanding of the 
<BR>
structure of the Universe, or a developer of cybersex portal 
<BR>
has over late Mother Teresa in understanding the perspectives of
<BR>
romance-by-correspondence.
<BR>
<P>There are so many things these brilliant classics could not possibly
<BR>
see - in social aspects of communism in the rapidly changing
<BR>
economy where the nature of value, structure of economic processes
<BR>
and role of innovation changes to the extent obviating current
<BR>
economic theories; in evolution of technologies creating new
<BR>
development imperatives for both social control and social
<BR>
freedoms; in personal, direct, tiny-yet-crucial details of
<BR>
actual life of all envisioned social roles, and a great number
<BR>
of all unenvisioned ones - details of different types than what
<BR>
they could imagine, more boring and mundane, less photogenic
<BR>
and more fundamental than heroic efforts of brilliant dissidents
<BR>
and evil persecutors, as well as pictures of orderly economic
<BR>
development within a crisp and stable (with all difficulties)
<BR>
social system.
<BR>
<P>The reality has been so much different.  A tired computer 
<BR>
operator using an office printer to copy cake recipes for
<BR>
his manager's mother-in-law in exchange for a half-liter
<BR>
of not-well-denatured alcohol may be a more accurate 
<BR>
illustration of subversive socio-economic relations than
<BR>
any depictions of glorious suffering or synchronized
<BR>
economic advances.
<BR>
<P>There were some radical revelations in Orwell's and Lenin's
<BR>
works that I would consider superior to recent economic
<BR>
analysis of even relatively clear things like the share of
<BR>
the Soviet military expenses in GNP or agricultural production -
<BR>
I used to take part in fudging and inventing of a number
<BR>
of figures myself - from the muddy ground facts of collective
<BR>
farms to the Academy of Sciences reports on AI progress -
<BR>
and can only admire the ruthlessly cynical clarity of 
<BR>
Orwell's stories.   But neither Orwell, not his reader
<BR>
can tell the good insights from cynically distorted metaphors,
<BR>
mistaken predictions, and literary art of little theoretical
<BR>
significance.
<BR>
<P>I used to dream that the small, tired and dying-out group
<BR>
of theorists who was building their theories on the unique
<BR>
observations of the actual communist systems, would be
<BR>
called to share their insights - but it looks like the
<BR>
most costly social experiments in human history will
<BR>
not leave much observer analysis.  Actually, enough
<BR>
raw data for it may remain in the public archives and
<BR>
personal correspondence of millions of people, by some
<BR>
future AIs.  - Not from writings of dissident observers
<BR>
though - they have been thinking and talking, but not
<BR>
writing.  First - for fear; later - for lack of interest,
<BR>
and decreasing memory.
<BR>
<P>I try to keep my understanding of the communist society in
<BR>
mind when thinking of multi-agent and complex systems in
<BR>
general.  Upsetting things aside, the implementations of
<BR>
communism provide unique historical examples of systemic
<BR>
structures - an integration of political and corporate
<BR>
systems, an intermediate stage between an economy and
<BR>
a super-organism, a militantly atheistic social religion,
<BR>
a community of brilliant scientists and sophisticated
<BR>
writers scared into not seeing the apparent absurdities
<BR>
and injustices of their immediate environment - an
<BR>
internalized social schizophrenia - and so much more,
<BR>
partly repeating other systems' features, partly
<BR>
distorting them in bizarre ways, partly unprecedented.
<BR>
<P>It seems quite bizarre that the society that devotes huge
<BR>
resources to detailed studies of E. Coli, digging up
<BR>
clay tablets with scarce descriptions of primitive
<BR>
economic transactions, debating the tiniest details of
<BR>
old scriptures, and preserving old buildings and cemeteries,
<BR>
allows these unique hands-on studies to perish without being
<BR>
recorded.  Well, after watching the first formative years of
<BR>
Usenet traffic disappear in front of all social historians
<BR>
too busy studying clay tablets, I don't think it's a problem
<BR>
of with interest in understanding communism.  It's a general
<BR>
problem with understanding the importance of social processes.
<BR>
<P>What are the surviving theorists to do?  Make notes in hope
<BR>
to sell them to the Global AI in 40 years?  Or to use insights
<BR>
for building new multi-agent systems and speeding-up the
<BR>
emergence of this Global AI?  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or give up on it, and get some rest?
