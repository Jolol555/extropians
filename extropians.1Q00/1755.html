<EM>&gt; &gt;I will restrict myself here to one observation, and wait a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to see if someone else might not do a much better job than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I can in addressing your subtle question.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My question has subtle implications, but as MMB notes, it was an axe-blow.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now the question was &quot;...wouldn't it be true to say that, by hypothesis,
<BR>
Freud observed that *everything human* was eroticized?&quot; I found MMB's
<BR>
post interesting as a poetic device but much too metaphorical to be
<BR>
cited as support for the assertion &quot;there is something or other axiomatic
<BR>
in Freud's work that leads to the conclusion that 'if a thing is human, then
<BR>
it is eroticized'.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[1] I have no idea how to interpret the logical or semantic meaning of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion and therefore I have no way of knowing whether it is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valid deduction, i.e. logically true.
<BR>
<P>[2] I cited Freud's viewpoint as a &quot;one perspective&quot;, i.e. one way of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modeling the phenomenon.  The only possible sense in which a model
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; is either operationally (Bridgman) or analogically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Vaihinger). That is, useful therapeutically or instrumentally.
<BR>
<P>[3] By extension, Freudian theory in my view is a simulation which either
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;succeeds or fails to make useful predictions.  The material from your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book demonstrates clearly that the outcome is mixed, about as reliable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as meteorological simulations of the atmosphere, landmass variables
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the upper ocean.
<BR>
<P>[4] Although not directly related to the topic, the efforts to hypostatize
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language which you cite are, as you suggest, not even wrong and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead to conclusions that are not even false.
