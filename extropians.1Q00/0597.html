Interesting things you can do with water....
<BR>
I remember once reading out of a book my first grade
<BR>
teacher gave me- she saw I was interested in science
<BR>
fiction novels, and so she gave me this book on the
<BR>
future, confiding that she hadn't actually expected
<BR>
there to be anyone who would be interested in it...
<BR>
that you could simply place an iron cage into most
<BR>
places in the ocean and it would magnetize bits of
<BR>
organic debris that contained magnetic minerals and
<BR>
cement them on the outside of the cage, forming a
<BR>
thick cement-like layer.... if your robots are fairly
<BR>
big, you could make a nice hull of some kind with
<BR>
this, I suppose....  maybe you could even make it a
<BR>
flat metal surface with no perforations and sort of
<BR>
scrape templates off of the outside...  that way, you
<BR>
could reuse the same frame a lot of times...  all
<BR>
you'd need to do is put in some of the other parts... 
<BR>
let's see... I think you could build wires by some
<BR>
sort of magnetization process also, if you can
<BR>
chemically sift the influx somehow... possibly you
<BR>
could have a sort of rotor device cutting everything
<BR>
up, with no outlet except the walls, which would be
<BR>
magnetized grids... so everything but the conductive
<BR>
metals would stay.  I'm sure somebody out there has a
<BR>
better method, I'm not familiar with oceanic refining
<BR>
processes, since I had heard that most of it was in so
<BR>
loose a concentration that this wouldn't work, though
<BR>
it occurs to me that if you can accrete a solid layer
<BR>
of fairly durable cement-like structure then maybe it
<BR>
wouldn't be incredibly difficult to filter... glass is
<BR>
easy... sand.  It's all just a matter of equipment...
<BR>
most of which we seem to want to grow.  Which may
<BR>
prove difficult.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we built the whole thing underwater, or
<BR>
simply created the island out of &quot;sea-ment&quot; and buoyed
<BR>
it upwards, anchoring the whole thing with chains...
<BR>
there's a lot of fun ideas when it comes to ocean
<BR>
based design.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I prefer the &quot;grow your own island&quot;

<EM>&gt; &gt; approach ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am continuing to think about ways to do this. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lately, I have been considering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dumping some mountain tops through underground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tunnels that come up under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ocean.  It has some advantage because you can run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the thing off the difference in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gravitational energy, and do not have as big a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooling problem as my last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion.  Of course, you have to pick a mountain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people will allow to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moved, but this may be offset by the nice flat land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can give them where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mountain was.  For a small island, you may only need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a small part of a mountain (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just hollow out a part) given that you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restructure the material to have just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much strength at a much lower density.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I remember thinking about this stuff back in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early seventies, long before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promise of MNT.  I was considering what it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take to build a robot harbor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dredger.  This machine would swim into a harbor and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dredge up a load of silt from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bottom and then swim out and dump it in deep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water.  My design allowed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine to recharge its batteries from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gravitational energy of lowering the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; silt.  This way it could work 24-7 and would have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface only to replace worn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parts.  After working on this a while, I realized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a fleet of these could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to build a deep water island out of parts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the undersea shelf.  The surface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the island would go slowly, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robots would need to dump most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the load in deep water to get the energy to put a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small part of the load on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface, but it could be done.  All of the above is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not very practical (i.e. would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost too much) unless you can &quot;grow&quot; the robots. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Anyone know how much we could get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paid to dredge a deep channel up the Mississippi? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Gulf is a nice place to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an island.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the problems with MNT is that it makes too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much possible.  When it gets here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I fear I will find myself in the position of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proverbial centipede who could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide which foot to move first.
