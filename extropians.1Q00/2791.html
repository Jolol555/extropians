<P>Yes, I am aware of that.

<P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Length is irrelevant, as technology can always

I was responding to &quot;you are big boys and girls
<BR>
now&quot;...a joke. And to my knowledge, there isn't that
<BR>
technology...yet. I could of course be wrong. If you
<BR>
know of any, that would be interesting.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt;And you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; should have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; brought up your own kids to be free (otherwise,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; the hell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; did you produce them?). 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |I didn't know people produced children; I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |gave birth to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The &quot;giving birth&quot; method, the traditional method,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not necessarily the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sole method of offspring production.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let me assure you that the parents actually and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely _produce_ the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offspring from their gametes, even though the phrase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;giving birth&quot; might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicate that it somehow just ``happens'' or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the local god visits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; young brides and makes them pregnant.  If this fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offends you, feel free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to ignore it (the fact will not go away, however).
</EM><BR>
<P>*grin* you have a point there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |It is pretty much naturally engrained into parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |that they need to protect their children from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |things, sex being one of them. It is a social thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |more than a natural thing, I think, but one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |none the less very present. I know; often enough I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |my parents hastily switching channels when my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |sister enters the room. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; YOU ARE IN ERROR.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The American obsession with sex appeared very late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in history.  There exists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no proof of &quot;naturally engrained&quot; parents to protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their children from sex.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, the opposite has been mainly the norm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throughout history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suggest you control your historical and scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sources.
</EM><BR>
<P>*ahem* Did I even *MENTION* historical references? I
<BR>
presumed that my statment would be taken in the
<BR>
here-and-now, not dredged up the 1950's and
<BR>
beforehand. I DO know my history...and I do know how
<BR>
sex was thought of in america before the cultural
<BR>
revolution of the sixties. And did I say
<BR>
naturally-engrained? I meant socially. As in American
<BR>
society. And if you noticed in the sentence below, I
<BR>
stated:&quot;It is a social thing
<BR>
more than a natural thing, I think&quot; and in no way did
<BR>
I mean &quot;all cultures&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why should the American obsession with sex define
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the moral of the world?
</EM><BR>
<P>Was I defining the moral of the world? If so, I was
<BR>
unaware that I was doing so... I believe that I
<BR>
mentioned within *my* rant soemthing about how in
<BR>
other societies it is not thought of the same. In
<BR>
fact, I did. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; OK, so you have a nation with weird sexual mores.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why should *I* care?
</EM><BR>
I was replying to another post.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In *this* country we have sex education for kids in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school.  So? Big deal.
</EM><BR>
We have it in some of the schools where I live, too...
<BR>
it just doesn't happen to be at mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Should we stop discussing beer so our brethren in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saudi-Arabia, where ethanol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a controlled substance, will not become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imprisoned?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know, should we? Personally, I wouldn't...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Should we stop discussing politics so our brethren
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in random dictatorships,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where discussing politics makes you an enemy of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; State, will not become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imprisoned, tortured, and killed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have to draw a line somewhere.  I say we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do it here and now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Q: What can we discuss if any sundry sepcial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstance of some weird local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    custom and even weirder local laws are taken into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A: NOTHING RELEVANT.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This censorship-related meme would have little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significance if it not happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to exists in a nation with a planet-wide military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force armed with nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons, and an extremely well-oiled propaganda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparatus to further its memes.
</EM><BR>
<P>mmm....sounds like you don't like america all that
<BR>
well. Can't say I blame can you...you've never heard
<BR>
*my* rant on america's over-funded military, have you?
<BR>
No...I don't think I've posted that on extropians.
<BR>
Either way, it's a double-pointed barb...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus, any weird meme from the U.S. can easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propagate around the planet in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no time, up to and including such highlights as The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A-Team, Oprah Winfrey,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; root beer, and marshmallows.
</EM><BR>
<P>A pity...I've never liked either Oprah Winfrey or
<BR>
marshmallows. Perhaps my history has been neglected in
<BR>
that I've never heard of the 'A-team'. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Remember various previous weird meme complexes which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have swept around:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o	``We must stop masturbation! It makes you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feeble-minded and blind!''
</EM><BR>
<P>If you've read the Meme Machine, there's a section on
<BR>
why that complexe might have developed. That doesn't
<BR>
make it any less insane, of course.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Never has so sadistic machinery been generated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mankind to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	on and around tender body parts of children to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``save'' them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o	``We must save our race from bad elements!''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Holocaust in Nazi Germany, naturally.  But also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sterilization and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	active euthanasia in lots of countries, incl.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scandinavia and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Australia.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;again it's fairly well explained in the Meme
<BR>
machine... one of the many bad meme things....it's
<BR>
affected other countries as well....the Tutsis
<BR>
massacre of the Bahutu...or was it vice versa? I've
<BR>
never been able to find much about that...I supppose
<BR>
it's censorship. I do know that America didn't lift a
<BR>
finger during that.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   o	``We must save people from drugs!''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	War on Drugs, naturally.  The resources used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generate the police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	state could have been used to control real crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (violence, rape,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	murder, roobbings, burglary, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>I know. That one's completely senseless. Drug laws
<BR>
should only be enforced if they hurt others...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   o	``We must stop the heretics!''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Torture, pain, burning at the stake, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I know, I'd have been killed about (two?)
<BR>
centuries back, and many of my friends as well, if
<BR>
we'd maintained our beliefs in a much-varied
<BR>
environ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   o	``We must save the souls of these poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creatures!''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Torture, pain, burning at the stake, etc.
</EM><BR>
This one's always agitated me.of course, all of these
<BR>
still subsist on different levels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The remedy has always been worse than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``problem''.  Only time will tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what weirdness come from the ``We must save our kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from sex!'' meme.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hopefully, it will make the meme carriers to stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breeding altogether. !-[
