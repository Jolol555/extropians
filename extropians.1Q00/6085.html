<P>While I understand that natural longevity has a strong genetic component, it seems to
<BR>
run in families, I'm not sure what else you are getting at. I was under the
<BR>
impression that healthy living for the most part tends has an impact, though the
<BR>
yardstick you use is important, for example, cardiovascular fitness is more important
<BR>
than actual height/weight ratios or percentage of body fat.
<BR>
<P>I think that since longevity does tend to run in families, that finding longevity
<BR>
genes be a primary project, to develop a 'longevity pill' that allows the patient to
<BR>
'infect' themselves with a virus that rewrites their own longevity genes for maximum
<BR>
performance. Since the concern you have that such treatment would be reserved to a
<BR>
few implies that it will be expensive, I have to disagree with you here. Medical
<BR>
treatments that are expensive are that way because they cannot be mass produced, or
<BR>
that their potential pool of users is so small that the per dose R&amp;D cost is 95%+ of
<BR>
the dose price. With longevity genediting treatment, you have a patient pool of 6
<BR>
billion people, so the R&amp;D is spread over the largest market size possible. Longevity
<BR>
treatment should be as cheap as smallpox or polio vaccines.
