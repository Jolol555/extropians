This thread raised some questions about the sovereignity of artificial 
<BR>
islands and the like.  Allow me to quote at length from some relevant bits 
<BR>
of, &quot;The Last Free Place on Earth,&quot; 12 EXTROPY 14 (Winter-Spring 1994) 
<BR>
(footnotes excised):
<BR>
<P>&quot;The [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982] 
<BR>
grants every coastal State an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) reaching up to 
<BR>
200 nautical miles (nmi)--or about 370.4 km--offshore. A State has an 
<BR>
exclusive right to construct artificial islands and other installations 
<BR>
within its EEZ.[n.7] This alone rules out many of the best sites for a new 
<BR>
sovereign territory. But the '82 Convention also grants coastal States rights 
<BR>
over their continental shelves for at least 200 nmi offshore, and sometimes 
<BR>
up to 350 nmi (648.2 km).[n.8] Essentially, then, the '82 Convention puts 
<BR>
every shallow coastal area out-of-bounds.[n.9]
<BR>
<P>&quot;Fortunately, seamounts offer many relatively shallow building sites on the 
<BR>
high seas. Some 10,000 seamounts appear in the Pacific alone; others appear 
<BR>
in the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, the South China Sea, and the Gulf of 
<BR>
Alaska.[n.10] Of course, many of these sit too deep for present technology to 
<BR>
put to good use. But estimates put over 70 seamounts within 185 m of the 
<BR>
ocean's surface--and well outside of any statist's territorial claims.[n.11] 
<BR>
An appreciable number of these come within 60 m of surface, and several come 
<BR>
within 9 m [n.12] Consider, for example, Vema seamount (63 m
<BR>
deep, at 31°38'S, 08°20'E) and Walters Shoal (42 m deep, at 33°13'S, 
<BR>
43°51'E).[n.13]
<BR>
<P>. . .
<BR>
<P>&quot;. . . The international law of the sea denies artificial islands all 
<BR>
maritime territorial claims except for narrow safety zones (usually of 500 
<BR>
m). This would put a sovereign artificial island at a distinct disadvantage 
<BR>
relative to land-based statists. But there may be a loophole in this 
<BR>
territorial restriction whereby alluvions, such as those deposited in the lee 
<BR>
of an ocean current, can form natural islands even if provoked or guided by 
<BR>
human works.[n.14] This suggests that you might grow a natural island next to 
<BR>
your artificial one, and thus claim rights to a territorial sea, an EEZ, and 
<BR>
a continental shelf.[n.15]&quot;
<BR>
<P>The full article, available at 
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/FreePla.html">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/FreePla.html</A>&gt;, has some interesting 
<BR>
details--including the one continental shelf I've found that lies outside of 
<BR>
any EEZ.
