<A HREF="mailto:joao.magalhaes@fundp.ac.be?Subject=Re:%20Polemics%20for%20longevity&In-Reply-To=&lt;001701bf6515$53c4fac0$4987ecd1@neptune&gt;">joao.magalhaes@fundp.ac.be</A>
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that the present human species' members are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil, destructive, stupid and selfish creatures (and I'm not claiming
</EM><BR>
myself
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as an exception).
</EM><BR>
<P>Why is &quot;selfishness&quot; in that list?  I tend toward Rand's view of
<BR>
selfishness, which is not to say that selfishness is good per se, but
<BR>
selfishness can be good.  I also agree with her that selflessness is always
<BR>
bad.  Ergo, one can have both good and bad forms of selfishness, but
<BR>
selflessness is not so divisible.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, that's a debate for another time, though others have already raised
<BR>
the question of &quot;self&quot; a few months ago on this list.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have one word for you: demagogy. I believe it's because of writing
</EM><BR>
things
<BR>
<EM>&gt; like this that, as you wrote, 'there is apparently a common caricature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropians as &quot;selfish, greedy despoilers of the environment&quot;'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look, I'm not an environmentalist. My views are basically the same as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones Robert expressed in his response to me (although, and as I mentioned,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our &quot;thresdhold&quot; views might diverge). But I do think the extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy is a anti-environmentalist. It's the old American view of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-market and anarcho-capitalism -- bound to generate huge wealth but
</EM><BR>
also
<BR>
<EM>&gt; enormous social problems (as the US have) and ecological disruption (as
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; US have and are causing on other countries such as Nigeria, Angola, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Middle East, Indonesia, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>Many of the problems Joao Pedro lists are not caused by the free market or
<BR>
the non-existent anarchocapitalism (what part of this planet is
<BR>
anarchocapitalist in any sense of the word?:).  A lof of social problems in
<BR>
the US are caused directly by government intervention in the market.  Rent
<BR>
control, e.g., creates a housing shortages and exhorbitant rents for new
<BR>
dwellings in NYC, near where I live.  (It also causes more people to move
<BR>
from the city to the countryside, creating commuting and environmental
<BR>
problems.  This is also aided and abetted by former government development
<BR>
plans which sought and still seek to cram all humans into ideal suburban or
<BR>
rural communities.)
<BR>
<P>Ecological disruption is, to a large extent, caused by government
<BR>
protections and subsidization of unprofitable economic development.  Face
<BR>
it, the free market on its own would not invest in the Amazon, the American
<BR>
Southwest, or Nigeria.  Those places are either unsafe, don't provide
<BR>
skilled labor, don't have the infrastructure (roads, housing, etc.), or
<BR>
lacking in resources.  Also, what resources there are are already owned --
<BR>
in the Lockean sense of the world, even if the local governments don't
<BR>
recognize such ownership -- by the locals.
<BR>
<P>I'm not saying the cure to all these problems is a free market, but a free
<BR>
market is not the cause of them.  Nor would not having a free market help.
<BR>
<P>Argh!  I've violated my own maxim not to get into political debates on this
<BR>
list.:)
<BR>
<P>Best regards!
