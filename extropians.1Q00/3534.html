<EM>&gt;  If one is a teacher, one need not poop on the phrase &quot;multiple 
</EM><BR>
intelligence&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure teaching used to be a very honorable profession.  I even remember 
<BR>
seeing a few that were good at teaching.....less lately that earlier...but to 
<BR>
each his (or her) own.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;snip very erudite discussion of Howard Gardner's theory&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I could give a good goddamn. If it helps children learn, it's good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If one has a vested bogged down in the need of being &quot;right&quot; one may find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  idea of other types of intelligence threatening, since in most nonlinear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thought processes you may not find a &quot;right&quot; answer. Only in logic can one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have certainty, so therefore some people claim it is the only one true 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intelligence. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Who cares? Go be right, I'll go spread love to kids ... bye bye
</EM><BR>
<P>Bad day at the office huh?
<BR>
<P>The point I was alluding to is similar to &quot;guilt by association&quot; but the 
<BR>
opposite.   Competence by association?  
<BR>
<P>Whatever you call it....I feel that if &lt;whatever&gt; has merit...it should be 
<BR>
able to stand alone...if not then it shouldn't hide under the wing of some 
<BR>
thing that DOES have merit.  Be it New Age Books sneaking into the Science 
<BR>
and Tech section...Fantasy cuddling up to the SF....or whatever...
<BR>
<P>And yeah...I like to be right.  I have been right now and then....
<BR>
<P>Often enough though I'm wrong.  This list lets me know pretty frequently that 
<BR>
my sacred cows are really chopped steak.  Oh well....
