<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  But the evidence suggests we have suggests that primitive

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environments could occur in simple organisms and then be incorporated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into more complex organisms.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can see I wasn't being clear.  What I meant by &quot;complex&quot; was simply
<BR>
organisms sufficiently advanced to have features like DNA, ribosomes,
<BR>
mitochondria, cell walls, etc.  Primitive life that hasn't solved these
<BR>
basic problems of biochemistry yet is in a poor position to evolve defenses
<BR>
against serious environmental hazards.  Of course, as you suggested, these
<BR>
featues seem to evolve in only a few hundred million years, so the window of
<BR>
vulnerability isn't all that big in terms of geological time.
<BR>
<P>However, there are a lot of types of worlds that can't meet this initial
<BR>
condition.  If there is never a period in a planet's history where the
<BR>
climate is hospitable to primitive, unspecialized life, then you're stuck
<BR>
with a lifeless rock.  For familiar forms of life that means you have to
<BR>
have stable bodies of liquid water, which is a pretty stiff limitation as
<BR>
planetary environments go.  There may be other biochemistries which can
<BR>
operate under different conditions, but they seem to be few and far between
<BR>
(or at least, we haven't thought of very many possibilities, and most of the
<BR>
planets we can see appear lifeless).
<BR>
<P>Thus, a lot of the ideas about extreme-environment life found in science
<BR>
fiction seem problematic to me, because life could not have gotten started
<BR>
in the first place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On our planet the vectors seems to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taken two directions.  One, that evolves greater complexity and a second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that seems to have evolved adaptation to environmental extremes.  Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it may be that the extreme environment vector for life was a direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result of extinction events (such as Snowball Earth).  There was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a limited &quot;complexification&quot; vector for a long time, perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it kept getting truncated.  Only after Snowball Earth have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things been stable enough for complexification to generate an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explosion of species.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting observation.  I think you may be on to something here.  OTOH, it
<BR>
is pretty much the opposite of what the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; theory hypothesizes -
<BR>
that you don't get complex life at all without repeated extinctions.
<BR>
<P>Ah, if only we could run experiments...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Which leads me to what I found interesting about this whole theory.  IMO
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should be rather unusual (to put it mildly) for a planet to undergo the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kinds of shifts the authors are talking about without completely wiping
</EM><BR>
out
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree.  For bacteria and yeast, they freeze quite well.  So you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply can't remain frozen *too* long or have massive radiation exposures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while frozen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'm not talking about the typical naive scenario of &quot;everything
<BR>
freezes for a thousand years, and when it eventually thaws there is nothing
<BR>
left alive&quot;.
<BR>
<P>What I'm thinking is that most planets would not produce repeated
<BR>
extinction/repopulation cycles.  Either there are no big really big climate
<BR>
changes in the first place, or the first one that happens will push the
<BR>
planet into a new equilibrium state in which liquid water can't exist.
<BR>
Either way, you don't get the hypothesized evolutionary kick-start.
<BR>
<P>For example, what happens if you just move Earth out from the sun a bit?
<BR>
There is a band at the outer edge of the liquid water zone where you need
<BR>
both greenhouse gases and a reasonable albedo to keep the temperature high
<BR>
enough.  If a world in that band has a big freeze it can't ever recover -
<BR>
the CO2 alone can't raise the temperature enough to start a warm spell.  You
<BR>
may or may not actually render life extinct, but you will never get a
<BR>
repopulation cycle.  Therefore, this theory would predict that multicellular
<BR>
life would not arise on such a world before its sun reached the end of its
<BR>
life cycle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You need a combination of surface gravity, water abundance, solar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; energy levels and geography that falls within very narrow limits to get
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kind of behavior they describe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aha, but they (in Rare Earth) are careful to say that they are considering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex life primarily *as we know it*.  For example, I question their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumption that you need oxygen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but that doesn't change the important point.  We could be talking about
<BR>
critters made of liquid helium living on Pluto, and the same principle would
<BR>
apply.  Repeated environmental perturbations of this size are a very
<BR>
unlikely event, regardless of what the baseline environment is.
