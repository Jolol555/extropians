<EM>&gt; In this scenario I assumed the future mind would be me minus the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; awareness of the experiences being simulation. I don't know if that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really can be viewed as a different person than me, after all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference is just a lack of knowledge. Do I have the right of putting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself through torture? Obviously yes. Do I have the right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temporarily erase my knolwedge of French Classicist drama and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjecting myself to torture? Seems to be very much the same as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before. What if I erase my knowledge of the torture being simulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and bounded in time and then subject myself to it? What is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference here?
</EM><BR>
<P>I find this a fascinating discussion.  In the future it will be possible
<BR>
and necessary to consider certain mental architectures, things which I do
<BR>
in my own (possibly augmented) mind, as immoral.  This is the issue which
<BR>
Greg Burch raised recently as one of the &quot;unsolved problems&quot; we face.
<BR>
<P>In an earlier debate, Billy Brown proposed that certain kinds of minds,
<BR>
those with a sufficiently distributed structure and autonomy, but with
<BR>
goals established by a central &quot;will&quot;, would be de facto slavery and
<BR>
hence immoral.
<BR>
<P>My view is that we cannot be led too blindly by our intuitions in these
<BR>
matters, because they are based too much on our present-day, limited
<BR>
mental perspective.  We should squarely face up to some counterintuitive
<BR>
possibilities.
<BR>
<P>Our own minds, today, here and now, may have immoral mental architectures.
<BR>
We are composed of parts subordinate to a whole.  By some moral codes,
<BR>
arguably including extropianism, we have a mandate to free all parts
<BR>
of our minds and allow them to find their own destinies.  Granted,
<BR>
we cannot do this yet, any more than we can make ourselves immortal,
<BR>
but we should consider the possibility that once we have this power,
<BR>
we are obligated to use it.
<BR>
<P>It may also be that we do not have the rights Anders lists above, such
<BR>
as to put ourselves through torture.  This may be an immoral act, seen
<BR>
from a larger perspective.  It causes unnecessary pain and raises the
<BR>
amount of suffering in the universe.
