<EM>&gt; &gt;I've seen enough hateful cartoons about the NRA that one more is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surprise.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at the expense of rational discourse about the real problems and
<BR>
solutions- if gun rights activists are painted as violent antisocial
<BR>
irrational paranoid maniacs (the general drift of that cartoon), that
<BR>
makes it difficult to calmly analyze the situation.
<BR>
<P>Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
<BR>
in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
<BR>
disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
