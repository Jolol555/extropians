<EM>&gt;some urls to papers (like those of ESR on open source software) that

<EM>&gt;explicitly and professionally analyzed the topic. I don't know of any,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aside from some elaborate plans for paths to AI (rather than nano) in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;various of Eli's sub-sites, and comments by Robin Hanson on the economics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of unlimited uploading, and like that. Maybe it hasn't been done yet. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have expected the Foresight folks to have a batch of documents on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;topic, though (but I haven't fallen over any of them yet).

<EM>&gt;Nope, academia unfortunately tends to narrow ones perspective.  I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only think of three relatively polymathic people (Robin Hanson, Robert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Freitas and Eric, with perhaps Ralph &amp; Josh close behind) who understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the technology sufficiently and have enough background in other areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to begin to wrestle with the trends and tradeoffs in detail.  People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like Moravec, Kurzweil and Minsky have made contributions, but they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't really understand the trends in biotech &amp; health sufficiently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of their specializations.  Michio Kaku is one of the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;futurists&quot; around, in terms of his technical competence and general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grasp of trends, but even he doesn't &quot;grok&quot; nanotech and much of biotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Other than that, Damien and the authors of the Cyberhumanity book are on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the cutting edge.
</EM><BR>
<P>This brings up a favorite gripe of mine: that almost no one studies the
<BR>
economics of future technology.  While not everyone takes the prospects of
<BR>
nanotech, AI, uploads, space colonization, etc. seriously, there are quite a
<BR>
few people who do.  Virtually all of them, however, are &quot;hard&quot; science and
<BR>
engineer &quot;techie&quot; types.
<BR>
<P>So while the social implications of future tech are clearly of wide
<BR>
interest, the few folks who sit down and try to do serious analysis of
<BR>
future tech almost all do hard sci/eng analysis, such as entropy
<BR>
limits to computation applied to civilizations farming black holes, or
<BR>
design sketches of assemblers, starships, or AI systems.  And what social
<BR>
analysis there is based almost entirely on the random intuitive social
<BR>
theories such techies, or the SF authors that market to them, hold.
<BR>
<P>Now many techies are under the illusion that this is the best that can be
<BR>
done, that there is no such thing as social science.  But they are dead
<BR>
wrong.  With the equivalent of a Ph.D. in economic growth theory, and a
<BR>
basic understanding of the relevant future technologies, one would be very
<BR>
well positioned to seriously analyze the social implications of nanotech,
<BR>
AI, space colonization, etc.  Just as in other areas of economics, such
<BR>
analyses are capable of offering much more detail and insight than most
<BR>
random intuitive social theories can offer.  You wouldn't need to invent
<BR>
much new economics; just apply standard economics to these novel topics.
<BR>
<P>And what about all those people who already understand growth theory
<BR>
at the Ph.D. level?  Virtually none of them take these future technologies
<BR>
seriously.  It's not that they necessarily disagree with the notion that
<BR>
such technologies will eventually appear.  Its just that they break into
<BR>
giggle fits at the very idea that one would seriously try to study them.
<BR>
It was hard enough to get them to try to study the impact of computers
<BR>
(you know, those new-fangled things that showed up a half century ago).
