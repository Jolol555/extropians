</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nyah nyah. Eliezer's always picking on me for using this common EdRegisian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rhetorical device. It's *mock*, *feigned* or *provisional* incredulity, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, and is intended to cosy up to the conventional reader before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandatory second stage of `but hang on, waaaait a minute, maybe this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent craziness isn't *quite* so loony *after* all...'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a gambit. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it gets old quickly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe you should keep using what seems to work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can tell you, though, as a writer in various public arenas for lo these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many decades: what causes most readers to smirk and flip the page is any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straight-up explicit announcement of the kinds of things Eli (and the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of us) take utterly for granted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are the page-flippers the guys I care about, or the guys who I'd rather
<BR>
stayed in the dark?  Have you ever actually *seen* someone smirk and
<BR>
flip the page?  Did you *ask* them to take it seriously before they did
<BR>
so?  How many people flip the page on incredulity?  What's the
<BR>
borderline amount of future shock before they flip the page - one shock
<BR>
level?  Two shock levels?  Now that it's been featured in _Time_
<BR>
magazine, how many people are still shocked by nanotechnology?  How does
<BR>
presenting information-plus-incredulity affect the ability of people to
<BR>
absorb information directly?
<BR>
<P>(I'm not implying that Damien is supposed to know the answer to all
<BR>
these questions.  I don't know the equivalent answers for combining
<BR>
tech-and-futurism with morality-and-quest.  I'm just saying that these
<BR>
are the fundamental questions to consider.)
<BR>
<P>For that matter, what exactly is the mechanism whereby incredulity makes
<BR>
a reader more likely to accept the argument?  Is the idea that you're
<BR>
synchronizing your presented emotions with the emotions that you guess
<BR>
the reader is likely to be feeling?  I'm willing to believe that most
<BR>
readers will feel incredulity, but unless they're dead to the Universe,
<BR>
I should think that they'd also feel a flash of hope, admiration, and
<BR>
hubris.  At the very least, those flashes should be explicitly
<BR>
acknowledged along with the incredulity.
