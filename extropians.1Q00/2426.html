<EM>&gt; Hey, what exactly is wrong with a man wanting there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be lots of beautiful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; women in the world?  (Or vice versa, of course.)
</EM><BR>
<P>What is this obsession with people's appearance?! I've
<BR>
been noticing it in the media for quite some time, and
<BR>
it's really *bugging* me. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (Now if you can also program them to tell you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best lover in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; universe whether or not that's true....)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about if we combine the body mods with a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hedonic engineering, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that sex can actually be as good as we all wish it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why don't we all just upload instead?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ever hear of the Stepford Wives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fictional treatments of this subject always assume
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that 1) the women are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coerced, 2) the men are either scum or nitwits, 3)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mental mods are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superficial, so the 'real you' is still in there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere, and 4) boring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mediocrity is somehow better than ant fantasy.  None
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of these assumptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are likely to hold in the real world.  I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the result will be,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I expect it will be far more complex (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting) than anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portrayed in fiction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; several people wrote (paraphrasing):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Body mods!  Eeek!  Oh, no, everyone will become a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soulless clone of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; latest trendy body style!  Evil corporations will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take over our bodies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doom us to an eternity of bland sameness.  The sky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is falling!  The sky is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; falling!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Get a grip, guys.  This attitude is itself an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example of mindless conformity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to decades of bad science fiction and intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elitism.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment of society where the herd instinct is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strong is teenagers, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is obviously a temporary phase.
</EM><BR>
<P>*moos and stamps her feet* oh, I have *SUCH* a strong
<BR>
desire to follow the crowd....*shakes her head* Okay,
<BR>
I have to agree here...a lot of teenagers have an
<BR>
overwhelming desire to follow the crowd. Being in high
<BR>
school myself, I see examples of it every day. But
<BR>
I've noticed similar among adult society
<BR>
too...although perhaps not in as great a number....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sure most people will want to be good looking,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that does not imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will all look the same.  It is already possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; altered to look like an attractive celebrity, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtually no one does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What most people want is to look like themselves,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only better.
</EM><BR>
<P>But for a while at least there will be fads like
<BR>
that....especially when the surgeries, etc., are
<BR>
cheaper and more accessible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, the middle class gets in shape while the upper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class goes looking for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways to stand out.  Since exceptional beauty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires that you look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different than everyone around you, that means a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole new branch of art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will arise to fill the demand for unusual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; esthetically pleasing bodies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And lets not forget that standards of beauty vary a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great deal from person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to person, let alone between different cultures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Meanwhile, we have lots of subcultures that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably diverge from human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; norms.  I predict that many Furries will actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become their favorite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anthropomorphic form, many sci-fi and fantasy fans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will want to look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humanoid aliens or fantasy races, and many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fetishists will lavish great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention on whatever it is that they like.  Throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a scattering of purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functional enhancements that happen to have cosmetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side effects and you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got a recipe for an explosion of diversity in human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appearance.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have a point there, but I still quiver to think of
<BR>
what cashier register magazines will be saying about
<BR>
all of this. I think perhaps, that once I'm immortal,
<BR>
I'll just retire to a little spot in the woods with my
<BR>
computer and wait a few centuries for that to die down
<BR>
a bit. *grin* hmmm...you've got me started on thinking
<BR>
up another book plot.
