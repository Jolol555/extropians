<EM>&gt; &gt;Yeah, the conspiracy grows: now it's that commie CNN, the creation of that

<EM>&gt; Objectivity is not something that anyone on this list can reasonably expect

<EM>&gt; from you on this issue, Ian.  Your entire study of it has been for the

<P>Ted Turner's past support for internationalism and the mercantilist
<BR>
control of the US government is well documented, and his personal
<BR>
opposition to the individual rights of all people has likewise been
<BR>
documented as far back as his Playboy interview shortly after he founded
<BR>
CNN in the early 80's. The fact that we have documented evidence that he
<BR>
has personally directed the CNN staff to not portray guns, gun owners,
<BR>
or gun rights in a positive light immediately marks him as not only a
<BR>
violator of the 1st amendment rights of his employees, but as an
<BR>
established foe of the rights of all people.
