<EM>&gt; However the situation in Chechniya and the recent articles on
</EM><BR>
micro-&gt;states do point out some very interesting problems we will be facing.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Lets say for example the GM or cloning issues turns out to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unresolvable. Will the only solution be for the pro-technology people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;move to a specific location and declare independence?  If so, how does &gt;one
</EM><BR>
accomplish this.  The people in Chechniya seem to provide good
<BR>
<EM>&gt; examples of how not to do it, while the people of Quebec may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a process that shows how it might be done.

<P>This, I believe, is a mixing of  'atoms and bits'. Nationalism is intimately
<BR>
tied to the physical. It is not enough to feel part of a group irrespective
<BR>
of the physical proximity of its members. To gain a sense of fulfillment the
<BR>
membership need to be collected together in physical space in order be
<BR>
reaffirmed with the sights, sounds, people, and feel that comes with that
<BR>
group. The classic example of course is the Jews, but they are just one of
<BR>
many examples.
<BR>
<P>To some extent there could be made something of the same argument
<BR>
with technology. However, technology are tools, and if it assumes some sort
<BR>
of cultural expression i.e. cyberculture, it is an expression of an
<BR>
underlying set of values that science and techology is the way towards human
<BR>
betterment. Yet, it does not have neither the scope or depth, historically,
<BR>
psychologically, or emotionally as does nationalism.
<BR>
<P>In terms of the future the worst that can happen is that technology for
<BR>
whatever reason becomes the province of a small elite.  Almost certain the
<BR>
future will be a world that has embraced the new technologies with small
<BR>
pockets of hold outs. Their reasons will vary, but this has precedence in
<BR>
history. Aboriginal peoples in Austrialia when introduced to agriculture by
<BR>
the English in the 18th century, well understood what it was, but choose not
<BR>
to adopt it because it would mean leaving their way of life. Amish, more
<BR>
orthodox Mormons, people who have always insisted on schooling their
<BR>
children at home, all appeal to the past to justify their resistance to
<BR>
change or pick and choose what they will or will not adopt. As a glue for
<BR>
community anti technology will always be stronger than technology.
