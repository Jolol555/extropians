<P><EM>&gt;Better to seek for ways to coexist, to have a world where some people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experiment with new ideas and new ways of life, while others retain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the traditions of the past.  Religion has a place in the future, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do environmentalism, communism and other forms of social cooperation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and many other meme sets which we tend to see as our opponents.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  This has been my view as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My ideal world is not one in which everyone is just like me, and I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure most of us feel the same way.  Practicing tolerance of those with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different views is an important step towards that world.  Think of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as Gandhian non-violence brought into the memetic world, memes which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempt to coexist without defeating their rivals.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here also.  Tolerance and acceptance of other's views is an adult
<BR>
way to be in the world.  But life is not always so wonderful and I would
<BR>
rather have skilled extropians dealing with issues rather than basking in
<BR>
the sun sitting on our hands afraid to get involved.  Mind you, I mean when
<BR>
the *time is right* and timing is very important.  As we know, not all
<BR>
battles are worth wadging and the sure-footed wise-person knows which
<BR>
battles to fight.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(snip) It has long seemed to me that the traditional mode
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of discourse, argument and rebuttal, is not very successful.  I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have seen mostly failures in our own debates here.  We are much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successful when we are working cooperatively, brainstorming together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bouncing ideas off one another.  I would like to see us find a way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bring this kind of approach into a larger arena.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on who is debating.  The list is not a professional arena and
<BR>
often emotions flare.  I would think that someone very skilled in debating
<BR>
and who does it professionally, such as Max, is quite adept at making a
<BR>
debate format a success, as he has done so many times.  Therefore, a debate
<BR>
format would be beneficial, especially up against Rifkin and the likes.
<BR>
This takes talent and skill as well as a positive type of personality
<BR>
because a machiavellian type of debater can and does more harm for a cause
<BR>
than good.  I don't think we have to worry about that in Max.  Many people
<BR>
enjoy debating, but not all are authentically good at it.  I think we will
<BR>
see more and more debates in the next years with Max, and I think that his
<BR>
kindness and humor will be his ally in this regard.
<BR>
<P>Collaborative brainstorming is best when the environment is creative and
<BR>
the there is a product to be produced or a problem to be solved.  The
<BR>
tensions are lighter, most people go into a collaborative situation with an
<BR>
even sensibility rather than a one-uppersonship, so the landscape is more
<BR>
suitable for an ability to build off of someone else's ideas and improvise
<BR>
as well.  
<BR>
<P>Both types of environments can be beneficial to dealing with problems and
<BR>
situations where transhuman ideas are put down or attacked.
