<EM>&gt; &gt;Some of the viruses are probably beneficial, at least on the long run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(coevolution boosts fitness).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On a related point, I was speculating recently on the possible evolution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sexually transmitted disease which boosts the libido and vitality of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infected individuals. This would make much more sense then the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strains, which harm sexual success of the victim by covering the afflicted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area with unsightly and painful sores, thus limiting their own infection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; success. It would seem that an STD which resulted in higher sex drive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which someone made the infected individual better looking would be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredibly successful STD. I then started to wonder if this has perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already happened, and the virus is now just considered a part of normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human biology, or perhaps incorporated into the genome.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if our own genetic &quot;defenses&quot; are the reason behind the
<BR>
phenotypic response of infection. DNA provides for the showing of
<BR>
infection by nastiness so that the species as a whole is alerted to a
<BR>
less than healthful state. This in turn leads to an infected person
<BR>
being shunned as a possible procreation partner. Aspects of our genetic
<BR>
heritage have provided for a mechanism that helps weed out possible
<BR>
transmission.
<BR>
<P>Although, phenotypic responses to HIV (a virus that appears to be more
<BR>
recent than something like gonorrhea) often don't occur until many
<BR>
months to years after infection. This would be more than enough time to
<BR>
infect others that don't have the benefit of perceiving your less than
<BR>
healthy state. Similarly, some of the herpes viruses have dormant
<BR>
periods where they are not phenotypically visible. I would say, by and
<BR>
large, we are seeing some adaptations on the part of more recent viruses
<BR>
to avoid detection so that they will be transmitted to another food
<BR>
source.
