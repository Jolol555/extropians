<EM>&gt; RED LIGHT CAMERS CAUSE DRAMATIC DROP IN VIOLATIONS:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Metropolitan Police report red-light violations have dropped 60 percent at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; District of Columbia intersections where cameras designed to capture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lawbreaking drivers on film have been installed. The program has been such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; success that Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey is expanding the operation with at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least 20 new red-light cameras and the installation of cameras that detect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speeders. &quot;These programs are helping us improve traffic safety, while bringing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in new revenue for the District,&quot; Chief Ramsey told the D.C. Council. Through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the end of February, the city has collected more than $2.4 million in fines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Violators get a ticket in the mail for the indiscretion, at a cost of $75 a ticket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plus two points on their license. Police officials said the highly automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system makes issuing the red-light violations easier, alerts distracted drivers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more promptly and, apparently, serves as an effective deterrent. The firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handling the equipment, Lockheed Martin IMS, has installed 36 cameras at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intersections throughout the city. Six more are pending, and Chief Ramsey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants to add 20 more after that. Lockheed makes about $26 from every ticket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is paid, and the city does not pay any money up front. The company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controls the entire process, from installing the cameras to sending out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tickets. (Washington Times)
</EM><BR>
<P>All this indicates is that red light offenders are habitual offenders.
<BR>
Its known that 90% of crime is committed by less than a few percent of
<BR>
the population. Confiscating the rights of all in order to control a few
<BR>
is anathema to liberty and the individual.
