<EM>&gt; I really like your sociogram, Spike.  I only spot one difficulty -- as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you suggest, extremes tend to meet because they are really the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two opposing faces of one thing, &quot;Agnostic::Dogmatic Atheist&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't seem to work very well.  Here's what I suggest, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though it's a bit more complicated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Positivist-Humanist-Liberal-Orthodox-Fundamentalist-Atheist-Nihilist
</EM><BR>
<P>I like it.  Max More will likely weigh in on this, as this I think is his
<BR>
area of expertise.  The problem I see with your spectrum above is
<BR>
it places the similar humanist and atheist too far apart, nearly opposite.
<BR>
<P>My original map needs more detail between dogmatic atheist
<BR>
and agnostic, this I acknowledge.  {8-]  Since I attended a
<BR>
religious college, I was able to collect a wealth of data, watching
<BR>
as people moved along paths, around the circle.  As in political
<BR>
thought spaces, one normally does not go to the opposite side
<BR>
of the circle: one may go from being radical to reactionary, which
<BR>
are adjacent, but usually not from conservative republican to
<BR>
liberal democrat for instance.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, I watched as a roommate went from hardcore fundamentalist
<BR>
believer to atheist in one evening.  (That was really a trip.  I may
<BR>
comment on it later.)  I myself went the same route, but it took several
<BR>
months and I went kicking and screaming every step.  Once I decided
<BR>
to objectively examine the evidence and follow the truth regardless
<BR>
of where it leads, then the conclusions were inevitable as all hell. spike
