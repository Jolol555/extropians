<EM>&gt; I was thinking that &quot;stuff vitamin pills down your neck&quot; might be closer
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the mark, but I am suspicious about how many of us actually try practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension, and how many of us just wait for the miracle cure (and
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from someone who is trying to get a notebook together, so he can do his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleworking in the nearest cafe, replete with endless latte's...)
</EM><BR>
<P>I practice life extension _now_ because I want to be alive when the &quot;miracle
<BR>
cure&quot; comes along.:)
<BR>
<P>Of course, life extension should not be confused with &quot;stuff[ing] vitamin
<BR>
pills down your&quot; throat.  It can and probably should involve extensive
<BR>
supplementation, but one must focus on being aware of what one is doing.  I
<BR>
know too many people who believe popping a few pills is all they need to
<BR>
ever do -- and they do that without much research.  I think all personal
<BR>
life extension programs should start with research and a commitment to keep
<BR>
informed.  A good place to start is www.lef.org.  I think everyone on this
<BR>
list who is interested in life extension should at the very least cruise
<BR>
that site at least once a month.
<BR>
<P>That said, life style changes often have to be made too.  I think this can
<BR>
include changes in diet and activities as well as attitudes, place of work,
<BR>
place of residence, and the like.  Those changes are harder to make,
<BR>
especially since they often require a constant drive.
<BR>
<P>And then there's cryonics, but that's another thread.:)
<BR>
<P>Long lives to all of you!
