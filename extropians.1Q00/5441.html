Here's an interview with Nanovations President/CEO from the Wall Street
<BR>
Report, January 2000:
<BR>
<P>Real Time Quote
<BR>
Interview
<BR>
G. Robert Tatum, President and Chief Executive Officer, spoke with Wall
<BR>
Street Reporter Magazine.
<BR>
<P>WSR: Your company is involved with cutting-edge technology in an area known
<BR>
as photonics. Could you describe what photonics is and what the enormous
<BR>
benefits can be from this technology?
<BR>
GRT: I think the easiest way to describe photonics is to compare it to
<BR>
something that we already know and understand, which in electronics is the
<BR>
integrated circuit. An integrated circuit is comprised of thousands of
<BR>
transistors. A transistor is a switch that turns a flow of electrons off and
<BR>
on. When you combine these transistors together into a circuit in which all
<BR>
of the transistors and connections between them are fabricated
<BR>
simultaneously, that’s the genesis of an integrated circuit. The transistors
<BR>
are connected together without any external connections between them. With
<BR>
photonics, devices are powered by light instead of being powered by
<BR>
electricity. Imagine a switch that controls the flow of photons much the
<BR>
same way that a transistor controls the flow of electrons. The energy that
<BR>
is actually going through the switch in some configuration provides some
<BR>
type of processing logic function. There are many crucial advantages of
<BR>
photons. They are faster than electrons; they move at the speed of light --
<BR>
while electrons move at the speed of dark. Photons are smaller and do not
<BR>
generate heat. Unlike electrons, they don’t give off electromagnetic
<BR>
radiation that interferes with other signals. Fabricating many photonic
<BR>
switches onto a single circuit is the equivalent of an integrated circuit.
<BR>
We call that integrated optics. The technology and focus of Nanovation is to
<BR>
provid the tools and underlying processes to manufacture dense integrated
<BR>
optical devices.
<BR>
<P>WSR: What will be the vehicle of transmission for photonics?
<BR>
GRT: Today, we see widespread use of fiber optic cables linking together and
<BR>
providing rings around cities so people can communicate with photons or
<BR>
light waves traveling down glass pipes. All of the processing that takes
<BR>
place at each end of the fiber optic cable today is primarily driven by
<BR>
electronics. Therefore, you have this very high-speed signal traveling down
<BR>
the fiber optic cable and in order to route it and access it, we have to
<BR>
convert it back to electronics. This is a very expensive process.
<BR>
<P>WSR: But with your technology, that wouldn’t be the case?
<BR>
GRT: That’s right.
<BR>
<P>WSR: What has stopped us from moving ahead with it currently?
<BR>
GRT: It’s now a matter of developing the custom circuits to support
<BR>
applications. We’re starting to see many optical components out there --
<BR>
splitters, couplers and other similar products. It’s now a matter of getting
<BR>
the circuits designed and implemented by the major equipment manufacturers.
<BR>
That process is underway as we speak.
<BR>
<P>WSR: When do you think this technology will actually become highly
<BR>
commercialized?
<BR>
GRT: I think that you’ll see more photonic devices in the telecommunications
<BR>
marketplace by the end of 2000. In the fourth quarter of this year you’ll
<BR>
see more applications out there that are entirely photonic. Certainly the
<BR>
large telecom equipment manufacturers are all incorporating next-generation
<BR>
photonics into their networks to meet demand for bandwidth-intensive
<BR>
applications.
<BR>
<P>WSR: To the end user, what magnitude of speed enhancement will we see?
<BR>
GRT: Thousands of times faster. Thousands.
<BR>
<P>WSR: That means that downloading files, etc. will just take a fraction of a
<BR>
second versus however long it takes us now?
<BR>
GRT: I’ll give you a real-world application. This evening if you want to
<BR>
watch a movie on HBO or one of the other movie channels, the only people
<BR>
that can afford to have the high-end equipment to access that type of high
<BR>
video data would be a TCI or your local cable provider. That’s why everybody
<BR>
watches the same movie at the same time. Ultimately, an all-photonic network
<BR>
will allow individual homes and businesses to access this
<BR>
bandwidth-intensive technology. It will be possible to have whatever content
<BR>
you want to have delivered to you, on demand.
<BR>
<P>WSR: How long has your company been in existence?
<BR>
GRT: Since 1996.
<BR>
WSR: And the funding for that?
<BR>
GRT: It’s all been private equity through accredited high network
<BR>
individuals up until the most recent round. We don’t have any venture
<BR>
capital in the company. During our last round with J.P. Morgan, we
<BR>
introduced institutional investors for the first time.
<BR>
WSR: Do you foresee a next round in the not too distant future?
<BR>
GRT: Nanovation has not announced any additional offerings at this time.
<BR>
<P>WSR: The financing for the MIT project is rather substantial. Discuss it and
<BR>
tell us what you expect MIT to accomplish for you?
<BR>
GRT: Nanovation’s agreement with MIT is a six-year, $60 million partnership
<BR>
to build a world-class center dedicated to the research and prototyping of
<BR>
light-based technologies. Nanovation will fund interdisciplinary MIT
<BR>
research and the establishment and operation of a cutting-edge research
<BR>
facility. We’ve already provided MIT with the first year’s operating budget
<BR>
of $20 million. It’s estimated that we’ll spend about another $70 million
<BR>
over the succeeding five years.
<BR>
WSR: At that point, or through that time, your company will be cash negative
<BR>
in terms of funds generation?
<BR>
GRT: We’ll be cash negative through the year 2000.
<BR>
WSR: And then after that?
<BR>
GRT: We’re anticipating we should become cash flow positive in 2001.
<BR>
<P>WSR: What priorities have you set for your company over the next year?
<BR>
Obviously, one of these is to continue technologically to develop the
<BR>
circuitry. What other things are you concentrating on?
<BR>
GRT: First off, we would have to understand that we view our technology as
<BR>
an enabling technology that would be valid in lots of applications besides
<BR>
just telecommunications. For example, you will ultimately see laptops that
<BR>
can run for a month on a battery charge instead of three or four hours, like
<BR>
they do today. Certainly automotive, medical and aerospace come to mind. We
<BR>
don’t intend to develop products in all of those applications. We’re
<BR>
developing the technology that other companies would use to build their
<BR>
products and their applications. So, one of our goals would be to start to
<BR>
expand the introduction of our technology into other industries.
<BR>
<P>WSR: Will you possibly make an acquisition down the road to help that or is
<BR>
it your plan to do everything internally?
<BR>
GRT: Certainly acquisitions are part of our strategy to move our technology
<BR>
forward as quickly as possible. We have already made one acquisition last
<BR>
October when we acquired Apollo Photonics of Toronto. They were the leading
<BR>
designer and provider of software for photonic applications to simulate the
<BR>
circuit and to predict its performance. We’ve had such great success as a
<BR>
customer using that software, we decided to acquire the company to
<BR>
distribute that product to all of our customers.
<BR>
<P>WSR: What do you think your biggest challenges are right now?
<BR>
GRT: I think the biggest challenge is managing the stellar growth that is
<BR>
ahead of us. The applications and their uses are so widespread that we have
<BR>
to continually focus on the challenges that are immediately in front of us
<BR>
and not become distracted because, believe me, everybody has an application
<BR>
they’d like us to develop for them right now.
<BR>
<P>WSR: To conclude our discussion, is there anything that you would like to
<BR>
add or emphasize for our readers?
<BR>
GRT: Stand back and watch what’s going to happen; it’s going to be very
<BR>
exciting. The technology is smaller, faster, less expensive and more
<BR>
efficient. It’s going to touch virtually everyone’s life. There is scarcely
<BR>
any technology out there that can’t be enhanced with photonics if it has
<BR>
electrical components.
