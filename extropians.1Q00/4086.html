<P><EM>&gt; Why do you think it is possible to make such a thing cheaply?  I ask,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  because you're talking about a setup that would normally cost several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thousand dollars to build (and making it cheap is already a major design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  goal in the electronics industry).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we actually share the expectation that the device I describe can be 
<BR>
made very cheaply - just not now.  Note that I identified my idea as a 
<BR>
&quot;pie-eyed goal&quot;.  I don't see the utility of the idea (if it has any at all) 
<BR>
as being the notion that people should actually set about trying to build 
<BR>
such a thing now, but rather that defining the spec could serve as a spur to 
<BR>
for-profit activity.  It already pretty much is, so I think something like 
<BR>
this will likely happen eventually.  I think modest philanthropic funding for 
<BR>
a group of engineers to sketch out the hardware spec and the network 
<BR>
architecture for the over-all system might achieve two things, though.  One, 
<BR>
it could serve to define a goal toward which a number of diverse areas of 
<BR>
development could aim and, two, it could infuse the overall telecomputing 
<BR>
industry with a very large-scale humanitarian purpose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Why should we expect this to work better than simply giving them the money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  we would have spent on the gadgets?  I think the appeal hinges entirely on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the assumption that you can make the system for far less than normal market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cost, and then pass on the savings.
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea behind distributing the devices instead of money would be for the 
<BR>
people funding the project to get to exercise a little choice in selecting 
<BR>
large-scale social policy goals, raising the horizon of philanthropy from 
<BR>
simple food-distribution and emergency-response aid, to a longer-term goal of 
<BR>
raising the cognitive level of the most disadvantaged one-third of humanity.
