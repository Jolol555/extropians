<P><EM>    &gt;I feel quite comfortable that  the defense lawyers were well funded and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;adequate time to produce documents and edited video tapes, it's not my place
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;to say if they were or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not a lawyer so  I don't know or much care if the &quot;justice&quot; department's
<BR>
actions against Microsoft were legal or not. I do know that the actions were
<BR>
immoral and showed just as much intelligence as you'd expect from hack
<BR>
politicians and civil servants.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;We Americans don't live in a completely socialist country
</EM><BR>
<P>Fortunately that is true.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;it is not  completely capitalist either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately that is true.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;So then, if the government is to take some action, which it would be bound to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;upon ruling of antitrust violation sans rehabilitation,
</EM><BR>
<P>Rehabilitation? Do you mean if they would only stop being so damn successful, if they
<BR>
would stop spending their own money so wisely,  if they would just stop making
<BR>
products that people wanted to buy?
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;it should be to open it up  and &quot;level the playing field&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<P>It's interesting, there are 3 common phrases that, although not offensive in
<BR>
themselves,  have never, ever, been used in defense of anything I agreed with.
<BR>
The 3 are:
<BR>
<P>1)Life is sacred.
<BR>
2)you can't cry fire in a crowded movie theater.
<BR>
3)Level the playing field.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The responses to this post mostly show a general sense of antipathy towards the
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;government and specifically regulation.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's because you're on the Extropian list and that's our thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The food  producers are regulated somewhat, so that all packaged foods
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;have a list of ingredients and rudimentary nutrition information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not needed. If people value such information then it's a good marketing tool
<BR>
and so the regulation is redundant, if they don't value it then the regulation
<BR>
is worthless.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Advertising is supposedly truthful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Government getting into the truth determining business makes me very
<BR>
nervous, I'd rather do that little chore myself thank you very much.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;My opinion is that the people who pay to use this Windows to interoperate
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;with the many others that use Windows have the right in cases to fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;comprehend the functioning of this software,
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see why they have that right, it's not what they bought. They knew, or they
<BR>
should have know, that the software it was not open source, Microsoft never said
<BR>
or even hinted that it was.
