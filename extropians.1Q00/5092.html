<P>
I was listening to a story on NPR this morning that made me sit back and
<BR>
have a moment of satisfaction for what we do.  You can hear the story
<BR>
at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://search.npr.org/cf/cmn/cmnpd01fm.cfm?PrgDate=03/16/2000&PrgID=3">http://search.npr.org/cf/cmn/cmnpd01fm.cfm?PrgDate=03/16/2000&PrgID=3</A>
<BR>
<P>Look for the blurb that says:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; NPR's Margot Adler talks with Jon Katz, the author of &quot;Geeks: How Two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lost Boys Rode the Internet Out of Idaho,&quot; and Jesse Daily, one of the young men profiled in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the book, about what it is like to be a geek today. (8:20)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>In part of the story, an intelegent young man (Jesse) describes his
<BR>
highschool &quot;river of pain&quot; and how Jon's geek research caused him to use
<BR>
the net to try to reformulate his life.  He said that at one point he
<BR>
scraped together all the money he had to go to a two day nanotech
<BR>
conferece in San Jose.  That was a major turning point where he saw
<BR>
people push technical possibilites to the limit without fear of loss of
<BR>
social standing by being too smart.
<BR>
<P>Many of us here have supported these conferences over the years, and I
<BR>
thank each of you who have done so.  I think anything we can do to show
<BR>
young people that understanding science and technology is not a bad
<BR>
thing, goes toward science and technology not being used for bad ends.
<BR>
