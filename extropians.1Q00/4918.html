<EM>&gt; &gt;Short-sighted people try to control the misuse of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technologies by restricting their use with government.  What that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;generally accomplishes is to limit their good uses while ensuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that they will still get into the hands of criminals and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;insane--especially those working for the government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's no wonder this is a hot-button issue among Extropians; we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the architects of the future and proponents of technology.  How do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we expect to address the public's fears about its misuse when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;still have so much fear and misunderstanding of centuries-old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If it seems like we are beating a dead horse with this issue, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;because it is so central to our core values--to what it means to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be an Extropian--that we can't simply gloss over it.  We need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;decide how access to future technologies will be controlled, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the best way to do that is to examine how present ones are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;controlled, and how well current methods work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excellent point, you've clearly cut to the heart of the matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a conflict between those who say that technology is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely material, it can have &quot;inherent evil&quot; and therefore can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justifiably banned, and those who say &quot;punish those who misuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, not technology itself.&quot; The latter position argues in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favor of personnal responsibility, a core extropian value. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; former excuses misusers from personnal responsibility, and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore anti-extropian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
This is a false dichotomy; I am not in favor of banning firearms 
<BR>
outright, just keeping them out of the hands of those who can be 
<BR>
expected, from their mental condition or past behavior, to abuse 
<BR>
the responsibility concommitant with the right to keep and bear 
<BR>
firearms.  Such a position is required of those who would call 
<BR>
themselves responsible, and should have the support of all who 
<BR>
favor responsible gun possession. To advocate the free access of 
<BR>
firearms for convicted violent criminals, those who have had to be 
<BR>
legally restrained from intimidating and abusing others, the 
<BR>
incompetent and the insane is the height of irresponsibility, and 
<BR>
furthermore, demonstrates a substitution of dogmatic and 
<BR>
mantric progun-for-everyone rhetoric for rational reflection and 
<BR>
common sense.  The world may be safer if everyone has a gun 
<BR>
than if everyone does not (although the experiences of Japan and 
<BR>
Great Britain put the lie to this contention), but there can be no 
<BR>
question that the safest world of all would be the one where only 
<BR>
the responsible retain the right to keep and bear, and that although 
<BR>
such a utopia may be in principle impossible, we should put into  
<BR>
practice measures designed to more closely approach it.
