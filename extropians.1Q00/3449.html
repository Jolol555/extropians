<P>
<EM>&gt; No. You're observing exactly what I pointed out at the end of my post. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard to eliminate human alterior motivations from supposed debate. I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested only in the truth. I'm not a great fan of the way humans conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves, and would like to improve the situation by making at least some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proportion of human debate purely reasonable.
</EM><BR>
<P>SOME portion of human debate *is* purely reasonable.  _After_ we decide on
<BR>
definitions and starting premises, the truth or falsehood of most claims
<BR>
is a matter of simple deduction.  However, this is not the case *before*
<BR>
we decide on definitions and premises, and this is arguably where debate
<BR>
is impossible. (Though perhaps some conversation is not.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that your definition is just a more objective version of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine. I stated mine in terms of human perception. You eliminate such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjectivity by using &quot;have causal effects on&quot; rather than &quot;perceive through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my senses&quot;. Obviously, entities must have a causal effect on your sensors to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be presented to your &quot;self&quot; as a perception.
</EM><BR>
<P>The important difference, however, is that qualia necessarily exist under
<BR>
your definition, whereas they don't necessarily exist (and thus they
<BR>
probably don't exist) under my definition.
<BR>
<P>As you may or may not be aware (check the archives), people who disbelieve
<BR>
in qualia do not believe that anything is &quot;presented&quot; to their senses at
<BR>
all.  In THAT sense of the word, I've argued, we don't *have* senses.  You
<BR>
process information &quot;dumbly,&quot; on this account, without Understanding or
<BR>
any Inner Experience of perception.
<BR>
<P>Your original definition gave existence in TERMS of perceptions (sense
<BR>
impressions); this is obviously begging the question against the position
<BR>
that we don't have sense impressions.  You attempted to provide a
<BR>
sense impression analysis of my causal argument, but if sense-impressions
<BR>
don't exist, this analysis severely breaks down.
<BR>
<P>Back when the qualia debate was raging, I employed a technical notation:
<BR>
Thinking, Knowing, Perceiving, etc. was what happens when someone with
<BR>
qualia has them.  You Perceive something when you have a quale presented
<BR>
before your mind; only then do you have any possibility of Knowing of its
<BR>
existence.  However, I might turn out to be a zombie, who only &quot;thinks,&quot;
<BR>
&quot;knows,&quot; and &quot;perceives,&quot; and by that I mean that the zombie acts exactly
<BR>
like a Thinker, acts like a Knower, acts like a Perceiver, with no
<BR>
behavioral or physical differentiation whatsoever, except that the zombie
<BR>
does not really have Experiences at all.
<BR>
<P>Clearly, &quot;thinking,&quot; &quot;knowing,&quot; and &quot;perceiving&quot; can all happen without
<BR>
any qualia in the world at all; it is what I am asserting is happening
<BR>
within you right now, despite some people's claims that more is going on.
<BR>
It is NOT necessary that qualia exist under my causal picture of
<BR>
existence.  IT IS necessary that qualia exist under your picture of
<BR>
existence.
<BR>
<P>Let me draw yet another picture: the claim that qualia do not exist, is
<BR>
the claim that NOTHING is presented to your senses (since you don't have
<BR>
any) and therefore the claim that nothing exists *under your definition of
<BR>
existence*.  NOTHING fulfills the criteria you specified for existence;
<BR>
you've got the wrong criteria.
<BR>
<P>If that didn't make sense to you, check out Ken's post from a couple of
<BR>
days ago and start checking old posts on the topic.
<BR>
<P>I don't think a qualia debate is worth the effort, but it is worthwhile to
<BR>
see how and why this debate is an intractable dispute of axioms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes we do. Debate. The establishment of definitions MUST be the first stage.
</EM><BR>
<P>On what grounds can you argue when the subject in question is the grounds
<BR>
of debate?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So given your comments above, what do you think debate is? Just a game, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointless pastime? Of course not. It's an opportunity to show off, get some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more brasso for your golden hats. To reap the calming, warm sensation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self respect from the feedback of others, impressed by your use of esoteric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vocabulary and poetic rhetoric. Is anyone on this list or elsewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in producing conclusions from debate, to perhaps make our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence more bearable? Probably not. I'm leaving this ostentatious,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puerile human reality for good if I don't find soon just ONE other person so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mewhere who isn't solely concerned with enhancing their social status to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reap the associated short term sensory benefits. So hands up anyone that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sees what I'm saying !
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow.  What a mouthful of words and beliefs you've ascribed to me, without
<BR>
even the benefit of stating my own case.
<BR>
<P>My epistemology (these days) is hermeneutical, a la PCR.  While I see
<BR>
analysis to be possible within the groundwork of a set of premises, the
<BR>
only way to select premises is to see which ones seem plausible to us;
<BR>
this is much the same way we do moral analysis.  I make it my project to
<BR>
have the most convincing argument possible, whether by refining the
<BR>
position I have currently in mind or, if the opposing position is more
<BR>
convincing, by switching to the position that's most convincing.
<BR>
<P>I find deduction to be very convincing, but only when performed from
<BR>
convincing premises.  Some things which I once found inherently convincing
<BR>
these days I find very unconvincing on account of the fact that they come
<BR>
into conflict with other beliefs that I have which I consider more
<BR>
convincing.
<BR>
<P>I reccomend you pick up a book called _Philosophy and the Mirror of
<BR>
Nature_ by Rorty.  Skim the historical sections and focus on the
<BR>
arguments.  You may find it quite eye opening.
