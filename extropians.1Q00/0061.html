<EM>&gt; This is a work in progress.  As you can see, I've developed three categories 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of opponents of transhumanist values and goals: 1) Greens, 2) Religious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Groups and 3) Hate Groups and Opponents of Liberty. I would appreciate help 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the list in compiling this list.

<P>Natasha replied:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In that your work is in progress and you will be specifying particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examples and issues within groups that oppose our views, I do have two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts:  (1) Using a political group as a target to oppose may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overbroad, unless, however, the group is unarguably vindictive.  In that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was once a Green Party electee and a transhuman at the same time, I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree with you that Greens (in general) are a threat to our culture.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alarmist environmentalists and alarmist anti-genetic engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advocates that are ridiculously and arrogantly obtuse.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps rather than focusing on groups, it would work better to focus
<BR>
on ideas.  Organize the list not in terms of opponents, but in terms of
<BR>
the ideas which opponents bring forth, the justifications they offer for
<BR>
opposing transhumanism.  Then your categories still work: opposition based
<BR>
on environmentalism, opposition based on religion, opposition based on
<BR>
desire for political control (for lack of a better phrase).  You can link
<BR>
to statements and articles which illustrate and advocate these positions.
