<EM>&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330053105.99677.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;Regarding those cameras going up all over the place in intersections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to catch red light runners: seems to me its only a software change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to allow anyone with access to turn on their MikeTracker, follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you everywhere.  I [and I think Zero] suggest we set those cameras to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a website so that anyone who wants can track anyone they want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Again, there are winners and losers, but as it is now, only the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government could even theoretically have a SpikeTracker. spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  What my opposition seems not to realize is that the government 
<BR>
*already* has the ability to conduct surveillance on us.  In my city there 
<BR>
are cameras on all the freeways and almost all the intersections.  The cops 
<BR>
can get a warrant behind my back and tap my telephone and intercept my 
<BR>
email.  They have thermal vision devices that can track my movement inside 
<BR>
my home while they are out in the street.  In some cities microphones are 
<BR>
being installed on grids throughout the city to listen for and pinpoint 
<BR>
gunshots.  These same mics might one day be used to listen in on your 
<BR>
private conversations as well.  There are spy satellites right now in the 
<BR>
sky that can show what color shirt you are wearing.
<BR>
<P>So really all I'm asking for is the ability to look back at them.  Funny 
<BR>
thing is that these guys who would deny me the right to keep an eye on my 
<BR>
government like that probably think of themselves as libertarians!
