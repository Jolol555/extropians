<P>
Here's a fun article from today's _New York Times_, available at
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/01/circuits/articles/20watc.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/01/circuits/articles/20watc.html</A>
<BR>
<P>The main reason I'm posting it here is because I was pleasantly surprised by 
<BR>
a sentence in the third paragraph:
<BR>
&quot;Until the time when such devices are implanted directly into the brain, 
<BR>
which is still some years away...&quot;
<BR>
This seems to me a little bit of evidence of the seepage of Extropian and 
<BR>
Transhumanist ideas into the mainstream.
<BR>
<P>By the way, I don't share the author's optimism that these wrist-based 
<BR>
deviced will catch on.  The main reason is that people generally don't want 
<BR>
to look like geeks, with a bunch of technical equipment riding around on 
<BR>
their wrists.  That there would be a large difference between having it ride 
<BR>
there, and having it ride, for example, on one's belt, might seem peculiar, 
<BR>
but I think it's because we've been wearing plain old time watches on our 
<BR>
wrists for, as this article mentions, nearly a century.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes to all,
<BR>

<P>STATE OF THE ART
<BR>
Look Out! New Wrist Devices on the Loose!

<BR>
Watches, Once Used to Tell Time, Are Rapidly Mutating...
<BR>
By PETER H. LEWIS
<BR>
<P><P>Marty Katz for The New York Times
<BR>
<P>SAMSUNG CELL PHONE WATCH -- This comes with an earphone and is expected by 
<BR>
the end of the year; the price has not been set. Samsung Electronics 
<BR>
America, Ridgefield Park, N.J., (201)229-4000, www.samsung.com.
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>t took more than half a century, but the consumer model of the Dick Tracy 
<BR>
two-way wrist radio is almost here.
<BR>
<P>With the relentless miniaturization of technology, the time has come for 
<BR>
wrist devices that have function lists as long as your arm: depending on 
<BR>
design, they double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers, 
<BR>
computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice 
<BR>
recorders, automobile security keys, television and VCR remote controls, 
<BR>
health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global Positioning System 
<BR>
monitors, altimeters, games and simple amusements. Some can even serve as 
<BR>
admission passes for ski lifts and museums. And, almost as an afterthought, 
<BR>
they tell time.
<BR>
<P>Following the example of the pocket watch, which first moved to the wrist 
<BR>
less than a century ago, more than a dozen different types of electronic 
<BR>
gadgets are strapping on straps and competing for space on the narrow 
<BR>
stretch of body between the hand and the forearm. Until the time when such 
<BR>
devices are implanted directly into the brain, which is still some years 
<BR>
away, the wrist is the most convenient place on the body to wear technology. 
<BR>
It does not encumber the hand, does not intrude on most manual tasks, moves 
<BR>
easily in front of the eyes and is easier to reach than, say, the ankle.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Timex is interested in the real estate of the wrist,&quot; said Susie Watson, a 
<BR>
spokeswoman for the Timex Corporation.
<BR>
<P>She declined to discuss some of the specific ideas Timex has for the wrist, 
<BR>
but she agreed that it was the next big technology battleground. &quot;It's 
<BR>
location, location, location,&quot; she said. &quot;The wrist is the most exciting and 
<BR>
accessible place on the body.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Advances in circuit integration and power management have enabled these 
<BR>
devices to shrink from handheld sizes to belt-clip sizes, and the move to 
<BR>
the wrist is seen as just another inevitable progression. As cell phones and 
<BR>
other gadgets become even smaller, attaching a wristband may become a 
<BR>
necessity to keep tiny phones and pagers from getting lost in a pocket or 
<BR>
purse.
<BR>
<P>At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, both 
<BR>
Motorola and Samsung demonstrated working prototypes of a digital phone 
<BR>
watch -- the closest thing yet to the fanciful two-way wrist radio worn on 
<BR>
the comics pages by Dick Tracy, whose fondness for exotic gadgets predated 
<BR>
James Bond by a generation.
<BR>
<P><P>Marty Katz for The New York
<BR>
<P>MOTOROLA ACCOMPLI -- A prototype wrist cell phone expected to reach the 
<BR>
market early next year. Pricing depends on the service plan chosen, but it 
<BR>
is expected to be around $300.
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>The two-way wrist radio made its debut in the Dick Tracy strip in January 
<BR>
1946, said Max Allan Collins, a novelist and filmmaker who wrote the strip 
<BR>
from 1977 to 1993. Mr. Collins said the strip's creator, Chester Gould, had 
<BR>
later said he had originally wanted Tracy to wear a wrist TV but that his 
<BR>
editors had called the idea too far-fetched.
<BR>
<P>Unlike the nerdy Batman, who wore all his gadgets on a belt strapped over 
<BR>
his leotard, Dick Tracy always favored elegant wrist-based technology that 
<BR>
fit in more with business attire, said Mr. Collins, who made it a point to 
<BR>
visit the Consumer Electronics Show every year he wrote the strip. He gave 
<BR>
Tracy a wrist computer in the early 1980's and a digital camera wristwatch 
<BR>
soon afterward, which the detective used to send pictures of fingerprints 
<BR>
and crime scenes wirelessly back to the police labs.
<BR>
<P>(The always prescient Tracy invented TV surveillance cameras in the early 
<BR>
1950's and investigated video piracy in the early 1980's. In the early 
<BR>
1990's, he tracked bad guys by triangulating on their cell phone calls, a 
<BR>
technique that only recently has become popular with the F.B.I.)
<BR>
<P>The Samsung phone, expected to reach the market before the end of the year, 
<BR>
uses speech recognition to allow the wearer to &quot;dial&quot; the wristphone by 
<BR>
speaking the numbers, and a tiny speakerphone eliminates the need to use an 
<BR>
earpiece. A Samsung spokesman said it was safe to assume that the first 
<BR>
units would cost more than the average detective's per diem.
<BR>
<P>Motorola's version of the wrist phone also uses speech recognition but 
<BR>
requires an ear-bud speaker and a microphone cord. Motorola said other 
<BR>
prototypes of the wrist phone were being tested, all based on Motorola's 
<BR>
popular V Series of small digital phones.
<BR>
<P>The wrist computer made its real-world debut in 1994, the wrist TV (in an 
<BR>
ungainly size) in 1998 and the Casio TV Remote Control Watch in 1999.
<BR>
<P>Casio's beefy G.P.S. watch arrived last year.
<BR>
<P>Seiko-Epson built a prototype wrist TV in 1982, only 18 years after Dick 
<BR>
Tracy got one. Over the years, several other companies have built 
<BR>
prototypes, but to get a decent-size color screen (say, 2 1/2 inches 
<BR>
diagonally) and enough battery power to run it for an hour or two, the video 
<BR>
watches had to weigh more than a pound. Last year, researchers at Microtune 
<BR>
in Texas shrank a TV receiver and tuner to microchip size, and new screen 
<BR>
and battery technologies could bring a wristwatch TV to market in about a 
<BR>
year.
<BR>
<P>However, Mark Knox, senior manager of Samsung's digital group, said a more 
<BR>
intriguing possibility was a wristwatch-style television receiver and tuner 
<BR>
that would attach to a pair of high-resolution display eyeglasses.
<BR>
<P>The wrist-TV-and-eyeglasses combination could conceivably float the 
<BR>
equivalent of a 60-inch HDTV picture in front of the wearer's eyes. &quot;This is 
<BR>
not a this-year thing,&quot; Mr. Knox said, &quot;but it could be a next-year thing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Microsoft Corporation and Timex teamed up in 1994 to combine the 
<BR>
functions of a Windows-based personal information manager with a wristwatch, 
<BR>
in the form of the Timex Data Link watch. Curiously, Casio has been 
<BR>
promoting its PC Unite watch as a &quot;world's first.&quot; Casio says the device 
<BR>
will be able to synchronize with Microsoft Outlook files and hold telephone 
<BR>
numbers, schedules and to-do lists -- just like the Timex Data Link. It can 
<BR>
also exchange data with Palm P.D.A.'s and Windows CE-based pocket PC's and 
<BR>
even other PC Unite watches.

<BR>
<P>CRIMESTOPPER VISION CAR ALARM WATCH -- About $100, available soon. Works 
<BR>
with Crimestopper Rage auto security systems, replacing keychain 
<BR>
transmitters. Crimestopper Security Products Inc., Simi Valley, Calif., 
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P><P>MP3 music players are taking different forms, ranging from Sony's prototype 
<BR>
Memory Stick MP3 player, about the size of a cigarette lighter, to Samsung's 
<BR>
prototype headphones with an MP3 player and Memory Stick slot. It was no 
<BR>
surprise, then, to see a couple of MP3 watches on display.
<BR>
<P>Casio's Wrist Audio Player, one of three exotic watches the company 
<BR>
demonstrated, will be able to store about 30 minutes of MP3 music files. The 
<BR>
files are downloaded to the watch from a PC. The capacity of the MP3 watch 
<BR>
doubles to about an hour for lower-quality MP3 files, like audio books.
<BR>
<P>The Casio Wrist Audio Player will be available in the spring at about $250.
<BR>
<P>Samsung also demonstrated an MP3 watch prototype, along with an MP3 
<BR>
telephone that held an entire audio CD's worth of music, although the 
<BR>
company appeared more proud of what it said was the world's first TV pocket 
<BR>
phone. The TV phone has a 1.8-inch color screen that can display VHF and UHF 
<BR>
broadcast channels in 256 colors.
<BR>
<P>A Sony spokesman noted that its tiny MP3 player could easily be moved to the 
<BR>
wrist. He also speculated that wrist-based MP3 players might also double as 
<BR>
voice recorders in the near future.
<BR>
<P>Casio's Data Bank Camera Watch includes a tiny black-and-white digital 
<BR>
camera that takes low-resolution images. The camera stores up to 100 
<BR>
postage-stamp-size images that can be viewed on the watch face or 
<BR>
transferred to a computer or small printer via an infrared link. The most 
<BR>
common use for this watch, a Casio spokesman predicted, will be to snap 
<BR>
pictures of people's faces to affix to the back of their business cards. 
<BR>
Look for it in May at about $200.
<BR>
<P>Seiko Instruments, which introduced a wrist computer called the Ruputer in 
<BR>
1998, has a new &quot;thermic&quot; watch that is powered by body heat instead of 
<BR>
batteries. As soon as the watch is removed from the wrist it goes into 
<BR>
power-saving hibernation.
<BR>
<P>Often forgotten in this vaudeville of tricks is the fact that some new 
<BR>
watches also tell time with atomic precision. Atomic precision these days 
<BR>
means that the watch will neither gain nor lose a second in some 20 million 
<BR>
years, which more than covers the probable warranty period. Today's atomic 
<BR>
clocks are so accurate that they have to be adjusted periodically to account 
<BR>
for fluctuations in Earth's rotation. There is no such thing as an atomic 
<BR>
wristwatch yet, but the next best thing is a radio-receiver watch that picks 
<BR>
up the WWVB radio signal broadcast from the National Institute of Standards 
<BR>
and Technology. Such wristwatches use the radio signal to adjust and 
<BR>
maintain atomic time, even adjusting for daylight time, and the date.
<BR>
<P>Timex has a new technology called Flextime, built into its Beepwear line of 
<BR>
pager watches, that automatically sets and keeps the correct time even as 
<BR>
the wearer changes time zones. When the pager is turned on and is in the 
<BR>
paging coverage area, Skytel keeps track of Coordinated Universal Time, used 
<BR>
by G.P.S. satellites, which are in turn maintained by the atomic clocks 
<BR>
operated by the government. Every four minutes or so, the pager gets a 
<BR>
signal with the precise time and date. Once a day, any time drift is 
<BR>
corrected, to the second. The Beepwear Pro watch is about $175, plus about 
<BR>
$10 monthly for local paging service.
<BR>
<P>The original Beepwear watches used to be so bulky that wearing one was like 
<BR>
wearing half a tennis ball on your wrist, but newer models have been 
<BR>
streamlined. They can receive news, sports and weather updates, and keep 
<BR>
track of more than 100 contacts.

<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>A new watch made by Swatch even tries to set a new universal time standard 
<BR>
it calls &quot;Internet Time, which divides the day into 1,000 &quot;beats&quot; of 86.4 
<BR>
seconds each. The center of time, 0 in Internet time, is midnight at the 
<BR>
Swatch headquarters in Switzerland.
<BR>
<P>Will Internet Time ever catch on? That sounds like a question for Timex's 
<BR>
TMX Mystery Answer Watch. Timex has shrunk the venerable magic 8-ball into a 
<BR>
wristwatch, with 14 random enigmatic replies. Will the stock market crash 
<BR>
today? &quot;Maybe.&quot; &quot;Can't Tell.&quot;
<BR>
<P>On the other, slightly more practical, hand, Timex has a line of Rush 
<BR>
watches that calculate the user's heart rate during workouts. They also have 
<BR>
up to 10 preset timers.
<BR>
<P>Mark of Fitness Inc. won an award at the show for its Wristwatch-Style Blood 
<BR>
Pressure Monitor MF-73, as did Oregon Scientific for its Pulsemeter 
<BR>
Wristwatch PM-138, which uses an optical pulse sensor to measure heart rate 
<BR>
with a mere touch of a finger.
<BR>
<P>Several companies have developed prototypes of wrist-based blood glucose 
<BR>
monitors for diabetics, but these are still several years away from 
<BR>
practical consumer use.
<BR>
<P>Swatch watches are better known for fashion than for technology, but the 
<BR>
company regularly attempts to push technology ahead. Indeed, it had an early 
<BR>
and unfortunately ungainly version of the cell-phone watch some time ago.
<BR>
<P>But it may be onto something with its Swatch Access technology, which blends 
<BR>
&quot;smart card&quot; digital storage with a timepiece. At some ski reports, the 
<BR>
wearer of an Access watch can purchase and download ski lift passes into the 
<BR>
watch. The wearer points an arm at a Swatch scanner and turnstiles open, 
<BR>
sort of an E-ZPass system for skiers. The microchip in the Access watch can 
<BR>
also be used for storing admission tickets to museums or concerts, or as a 
<BR>
hotel key.
<BR>
<P>As it assumes a greater role in the technology world, the wrist may also 
<BR>
become more vulnerable to repetitive stress injuries. Of course, Dick Tracy 
<BR>
packed a lot onto his wrist for 54 years without problems.
