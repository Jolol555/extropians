<P><EM>&gt; MMB Natural gas and wind power-for whatever the drawbacks, are currently the

<EM>&gt; growing-est sources of energy in power production.

<P>The pseudo-downside of Methane/Natural gas is the CO2 emissions
<BR>
and the fact that for high efficiency (esp. power generation) it
<BR>
requires large installations.  Home gas turbines are not available
<BR>
yet. Fuel cells using methane are currently expensive and fairly
<BR>
heavy (making them good for buses but less good for cars).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now to cut to the chase-got nano-got solar-got fusion????
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, you &quot;got nano&quot; now in biomass to methanol production which
<BR>
does occur now in countries from the U.S. to Brazil to India.
<BR>
The problem currently is that its a less dense fuel source and
<BR>
the market isn't as big as it is for petroleum products.  Cool
<BR>
nano comes as Eugene and I have been discussing when we can engineer
<BR>
photosynthetic methanol producing self-replicating machines.
<BR>
You obviously have solar now since the market is growing by
<BR>
leaps and bounds every year.  This gets subsidized and justified by
<BR>
the Europeans and Japanese as way to reduce foreign power sources
<BR>
(gas from Russia, oil from the MidEast, etc.).  Fusion is the
<BR>
only thing you really don't have and thats from underinvestment,
<BR>
because as others have pointed out, there are so many other energy
<BR>
sources, why do we need fusion.  I've also seen papers that indicate
<BR>
that you cannot make it a &quot;clean&quot; source due to the problem of disposal
<BR>
of the radioactive materials created as side effects radiation produced
<BR>
from the reactions.  This is, in contrast to, wind or Methane (with a lot
<BR>
of tree planting), wich could be considered relatively &quot;clean&quot; (considering
<BR>
of course the energy required to produce the wind or gas turbines)...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lets have some material, off the shelf examples-real world stuff.
</EM><BR>
Done.  If you want more, the net is an abundant resource for this
<BR>
material.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And tomorrow is always just around the corner and to quote the book &quot;Wasn't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tomorrow Wonderful?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>And its getting more wonderful every day... :-)
